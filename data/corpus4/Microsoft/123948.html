Buy Microsoft After Its 'Bad' Earnings Report - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha In all-too-predictable fashion, Microsoft is selling off after its quarterly earnings, even though the core results were quite strong. Investors are succumbing to short-term thinking and selling the stock based on Microsoft's large Nokia write-down. But this is not news and was fully expected. Meanwhile, Microsoft's core strategic objectives, specifically its shift into higher-value cloud businesses, remains fully on track. And Microsoft is seeing strong results across other businesses, like tablets and the Xbox. As a result, the last thing investors should do right now is sell Microsoft. Instead, the stock is a compelling buy. Shares of technology giant Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ) fell 4% after the company reported quarterly earnings, even though the results were largely as expected. Actually, Microsoft beat on adjusted earnings per share and revenue. What dragged the company down was its huge write down based on its restructuring. But again, this was already known. There wasn't much of anything that should have surprised investors and caused irrational selling, but that's exactly what happened. To me, this is a perfect example of Wall Street's short-term mentality. While the sell-side analysts are constantly obsessed with companies meeting quarterly targets, from a long-term perspective, Microsoft is doing everything it needs to do to position itself for future growth. Downsizing and restructuring its phone business is the proper course of action as is shifting focus toward the cloud. As a result, I remain very bullish on Microsoft, and if anything, investors should use this drop as a buying opportunity. On the surface, Microsoft's results look bad. The company recorded a massive $3.2 billion net loss, but this was due entirely to the $7.5 billion impairment charge related to the Nokia device acquisition. Including the restructuring, total charges reached $8.4 billion. Excluding all these charges, Microsoft would have earned $0.62 per share. That would have represented 10% year-over-year growth, so put differently, Microsoft's results were quite strong excluding the Nokia write-down. As it pertains to the Nokia mess, while the huge write-down is shocking because of the massive numbers involved, it's worth repeating that this is not news. Microsoft previously announced its major write-off and the subsequent impact on earnings. It's painful in the short term, but long term, this is exactly the right thing to do. Microsoft's Nokia acquisition was quite simply a bad decision. It hasn't worked out - the Lumia is not a serious player in the mobile phone industry. Rather than continue to invest time and resources in a failed idea, I'd much rather see a company admit its mistake, do what is necessary to right the wrong, and move on. Excellent Results In Microsoft's Growth Businesses While Wall Street panics about the huge write-off, meanwhile, Microsoft's businesses of the future are firing on all cylinders. For example, cloud revenue soared 88% (or 96% excluding foreign exchange) and reached an annualized rate that exceeds $8 billion due to the continued success of Office 365, Azure and Dynamics. Even on the consumer and devices side, things were simply not as bad as they seem. Windows revenue fell 22%, but this is likely due to the upcoming release of Windows 10, which is causing delayed PC sales. Surface revenue grew 117% year-over-year as the Surface Pro 3 continues to sell very well. Xbox revenue increased 27%, and last but not least search revenue rose 21% as Bing captured an additional 100 basis points of search share year over year. There is little sense to me in selling Microsoft now. At $45 per share, the stock trades for a very reasonable 9 times enterprise value to EBITDA and 16 times forward EPS estimates. This is especially true considering the company's excellent financial position and cash flow generation. Despite the huge write-down that captured the news headlines, Microsoft generated $5 billion of free cash flow last quarter and $23 billion of free cash flow in fiscal 2015. All that cash is piling up on the balance sheet. Microsoft now holds $108 billion in cash, short-term investments and long-term investments, up from $100 billion this point last year. Also remember that Microsoft is one of only three U.S. companies to hold the triple-A credit rating from Standard & Poor's. With its tremendous cash flow, Microsoft returns a lot of cash to shareholders. The company bought back $14.4 billion of stock and paid another $9.8 billion of dividends. The dividend has grown at a compound annual rate of 19% per year over the past five years. Microsoft is due to raise its dividend again later this year, and I'm fully expecting another double-digit increase. Thanks to the 4% drop after hours, the stock yields a very attractive 2.7%. I don't currently own Microsoft, but would love to start a position soon. A continued sell-off based on, what I believe, are irrational fears, is exactly what I'm hoping for. As the stock goes down, its future return potential goes up, as does its dividend yield. That's why I'm praying for Microsoft's panic selling to continue into the low-$40 range so I can buy this fantastic company at a bargain price.
