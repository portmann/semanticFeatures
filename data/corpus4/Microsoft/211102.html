Microsoft: 'Easy Trade Up' Campaign Will Inspire People To Buy New Windows 10 Laptops - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft is offering limited time, cash-back incentives to people who buy new Windows 10 laptops and trade in their used computers, including MacBooks. Microsoft's Easy Trade Up promo offers up to $200 cash back for traded-in old Windows computers. The U.S .and U.K. are covered by the Easy Trade Up campaign. I expect Microsoft to also expand this program to other countries soon. While Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) is busy implementing a contra revenue strategy to attract more corporate subscribers for its Google Apps for Work product, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) is busy propagating its Windows 10 business. Microsoft's newly-launched Easy Trade Up program is a contra-revenue style of incentivizing people to replace their old computers with new Windows 10 laptops. The Easy Trade Up cash-back promotion was made available for U.S. and U.K . customers. Microsoft offers $200 cash back to people who buy new (retail price of $599 or higher) Windows 10 laptops and then trade in their old Windows notebooks and all-in-one computers. The only requirement is that trade-in computers should be working and they should only have normal wear and tear from (a maximum of six) years of usage. Qualifying trade-in products are MacBooks, iMacs, any brand of Windows laptops, and all-in-one desktop computers. Microsoft clearly values old Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) computers and will give a $300 cash back if a customer will trade in an old MacBook or an iMac. The U.S. offer for Easy Trade Up expired Tuesday. However, I expect Microsoft to repeat this promotion in the future. I also look forward to Microsoft expanding the Easy Trade Up promo to include other countries like the Philippines. I have five 6-year old Wintel laptops/netbooks and one 2009 MacBook that I would love to trade in for new Windows 10 computers. Yes, it costs Microsoft to do cash-back promotions. However, it is a major helping hand for its OEM partners. Cash back promos help OEMs sell more of their latest Windows 10 notebooks and 2-in-1 products. Microsoft has every reason to help top PC vendors like Dell, Lenovo ( OTCPK:LNVGY ), Acer, Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ ), and Asustek ( OTC:ASUUY ) achieve better sales numbers. Making sure PC vendors pre-load their new laptops and desktop computers with Windows 10 is easier done when Microsoft helps them become more attractive to customers. The reality now is that there are OEMs who ship out Linux OS laptops and PCs because it helps them retail at lower price tags. Let us not forget that Microsoft is still not offering free Windows 10 licensing for new computers. The only free offer for Windows 10 is for people upgrading from older Windows computers they own. Aside from accepting money from third-party companies to pre-install their software on new computers, OEMs desperate to make money on razor-thin margins on sub-$500 computers are also often willing to ship them out without a commercial OS like Windows 10. Microsoft's overall strategy to build up a 1-billion strong Windows 10 ecosystem is in great jeopardy if its OEM partners find it difficult to sell new Windows 10 computers. I opine that an undesirable consequence of Microsoft's decision to offer free upgrades to Windows 10 is that it inspired many people and companies to stick to their old Windows 7 and Windows 8 machines. The PC industry continues to decline. PC vendors clearly need some contra-revenue effort from Microsoft to revive the flagging sales of PC products. Sad but true, Microsoft coded/optimized the Windows 10 OS to run efficiently even on 8-year old computers with only 1GB of RAM. The limited-time cash back offers in Easy Trade Up is therefore just a way for Microsoft to encourage people to also upgrade their hardware, not just their operating systems. The contra-revenue tactic in Easy Trade Up is justifiable. Instead of Microsoft spending too much money on advertising, it is more effective to attract customers to buy new Windows 10 computers if they could get cash back from their old computers. The Easy Trade Up is a time-limited promo so I expect it not to cause 9-figure operating losses like what Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) incurred in its tablet application processors campaign. Microsoft will also be able to recoup some of its cash back expenses through advertising and possible Office 365 subscriptions (from the people who availed of the Easy Trade Up promo). Furthermore, the contra-revenue in Alphabet's free Google Apps for Work offer to current Business Office 365 subscribers was a necessary move because Microsoft's Office 365 went from 7.7% in 2014 to 25% market share in 2015 in the all-important enterprise market. Google Apps, which enjoyed 16.3% market share in enterprise cloud software last year, only managed to grow to 22.8% this year. Microsoft's exemplary deployment of Office 365 as the top choice for enterprise customers within a year's time makes it a strong buy. The robust revenue growth from recurring enterprise subscription to Office 365 gives Microsoft a lot of extra money to spend on cash back promos for Windows 10 computers of its PC vendor partners. Earlier this year Okta reported that Office 365 was the most deployed cloud application among its more than 4,000 enterprise clients.
