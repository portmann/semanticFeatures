The Basics Of AMD's Most Important Product - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) | Seeking Alpha AMD's next architecture Zen is expected to arrive in late 2016. There has never been so much importance for a new architecture released by AMD. Without going into complex details, I explore why Zen is so important and what kind of doors it unlocks in AMD's not too distant future. When it comes to AMD's (NASDAQ: AMD ) stock there are strong opinions shouting from both sides of the fence, especially here on Seeking Alpha. Many contributors such as myself have jumped back and forth on the company's survivability but there still is a steady dose of mixed thoughts. When it comes to AMD, we either hear that it's a cheap stock with an insane upside or that it's withering away. This magnitude only demonstrates that AMD is a risky company and the stock's risky trends are only evidence of this. Due to this, I've moved from giving buy or sell recommendations and have instead transitioned into providing information to help investors come to their own conclusions. In this article I will focus on the reason why I and some others remain long AMD, and that's Zen. Not everyone understands the underlying intent and potential of the Zen core architecture and only see it as a product to package and give AMD another chance. Although this is true, there's much more to it than that. For the sake of simplicity, I won't be diving into complex details and instead want to focus on what the fuss is about with Zen, what its purpose is, and what doors it unlocks as a product. So the purpose of Zen is really no different than any other architecture made by any other semiconductor company: to create great CPUs. Unfortunately, building architectures are extremely tedious and take about four years to perform. AMD has two distinct architecture types, with one focusing on low power products such as low-end notebooks and the other focusing on extreme performance, or at least that was the goal. The low-power Jaguar (now Puma) architecture is an excellent chip and respectable contributors on the matter have consistently praised the architecture design as superior to Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) Atom products. However, we all know how desperate Intel was to soak up the mobile market, and the contra-revenue scheme destroyed almost every chance that AMD had to sell these cores. On the other hand, we have the high-power Bulldozer core that has been modified and renamed over the years with titles such as Steamroller, Piledriver and Excavator. With the industry being so complicated, many customers bought into the latter three cores thinking they would be something different only to be disappointed. I guess AMD had to sell something, right? It has been a little over four years since Bulldozer started clearing ground and it didn't take long to realize the failures. The old CEO was fired and soon after the highly-praised chip guru Jim Keller returned to AMD after moving to Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and started working on Zen with a clean slate approach. Recently, Jim Keller has left the throne in his typically ship-jumping fashion and is now over at Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ), but AMD has assured investors that the core has been taped up and is ready for a late 2016 launch. Being a clean-slate approach, we haven't seen any major leaks just yet. All we know is that its products will feature four, six or eight cores that are all optimized for performance, which will put it up against Intel's i3, i5 and i7 CPUs, particularly in the desktop area. We've also learned that it will be using a new AM4 socket and that new features to compete with Intel will play an important role. This is especially important as complicated tasks such as h.265 video compression for 4K videos start to become really important. If AMD is ambitious, we could see it create APUs featuring its next-generation GCN architecture as well as HBM2, which would be overpowering Intel's DDR4 memory. Other improvements that will help Zen fall under the manufacturing process or specifically the company's long-awaited transition into FinFET transistors at a much finer process. (Until AMD clarified it, it was asked when it would use FinFETs at almost every conference call or event). It's likely that Zen will start with Global Foundries' 14nm, which would be competing with Intel's 14nm process, and this would be leaps and bounds over AMD's current 28nm planar process. It's expected that Intel is getting ready to move to 10nm, but with the progress of Global Foundries, Samsung and TSMC, I'm optimistic that 10 or 12nm won't be too long after Zen's debut. The most important part of Zen is what it unlocks as a product. In addition to being competitive desktop and notebook chips, Zen unlocks the door to the server and workstation market that Intel has shut AMD out of. Intel's high-end processors have absorbed 99% of the server market and with Zen AMD finally has a chance to take some share back. The situation also is the same when it comes to high-end desktops and workstations. These two markets are targeted toward enterprises and professionals and AMD's lack of competition has allowed Intel to monopolize the areas and generate massive margins. One thing to note is that some of these markets may not be initially tackled by Zen itself, but rather the enhanced Zen Plus cores. Another area that Zen unlocks is a new target market for its semi-custom business. For current consoles, AMD was paid by Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Sony (NYSE: SNE ) to develop chips for the PS4 and Xbox One. However, the failure of Bulldozer forced the use of the lower power Jaguar architecture, but going forward AMD will actually be able to produce high-performance semi-custom solutions with Zen. This also is one of the reasons why I recently wrote that AMD could be assigned to a new round of gaming consoles much sooner than we originally thought. Finally, Zen fully opens the door to what's possible with performance notebooks, low and mid-range desktops, and most other products that AMD is currently selling in. Even in high-end gaming notebooks, AMD has a big opportunity through Zen-based APUs featuring the next generation of GCN. A current high-end gaming notebook requires buying into the high-margins of Intel's CPUs (which includes paying for the Intel integrated GPU that won't be used) and purchasing a separate high-margin Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) GPU. This is exactly why these two companies aren't inside of the PS4 and Xbox One and it's why I believe AMD has a big opportunity in gaming notebooks. Also, I've written about AMD's big opportunity in affordable notebook gaming and this chance can bear fruit under a Zen-based APU featuring next-generation graphics. A current high-end gaming notebook relies on buying into the high-margins of Intel's CPUs (which include paying for the Intel integrated graphics chip that won't be used) and purchasing a high-margin Nvidia GPU. This is exactly why these two companies aren't in the PS4 and Xbox One, and it's why I believe AMD has a big opportunity in gaming notebooks. A new architecture by AMD has never before been so important, and this is because the weight of the entire business' future is resting on it. Servers, workstations, desktops, notebooks, gaming consoles, semi-custom solutions and other similar products are all markets that AMD has either lost or missed out on due to the failure of its current Bulldozer architecture. (The reason why I included gaming consoles was because Sony and Microsoft could have built better gaming consoles if Bulldozer was better). I believe AMD is very lucky to be around today and is even luckier to have another chance to redeem itself with Zen. To some investors such as myself this is an opportunity not worth passing up, but as I mentioned in the introduction I cannot simply recommend buying or selling the chipmaker due to the high risks entailed. It's important that individual investors perform their own research and reach their own conclusions with any investment, especially with a risky company like AMD.
