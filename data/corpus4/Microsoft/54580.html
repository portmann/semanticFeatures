Microsoft: Private Cloud Access For Office 365 Will Accelerate Cloud Adoption - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft has announced that Office 365 will now be available via private link to Equinix cloud exchange. Office 365 is one of the components of Microsoft’s cloud. Office 365 subscriptions grew 35% during the last quarter, significantly slower than Microsoft’s cloud growth of 106% over the period. The availability of the service via private link will eliminate security fears and encourage more enterprise customers to use the service. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) has announced that Office 365 users will now be able to access the platform directly via a private link to Equinix (NASDAQ: EQIX ) data canters starting from the third quarter of the current year. The private link will enable Office 365 customers to use Azure ExpressRoute to establish a managed connection to the Office 365 platforms that will yield high-quality performance and more reliability while eliminating latency issues that are common with public clouds. The ExpressRoute/Equinix Office 365 private link will be available in 15 markets initially - Washington D.C., Tokyo, Sydney, Singapore, Silicon Valley, Seattle, Osaka, New York, Los Angeles, London, Hong Kong, Dallas, Chicago, Atlanta and Amsterdam. The move by Microsoft could be the first among a series of potentially similar moves by the company and can go a long way to helping the company realize its cloud ambitions. Microsoft is unquestionably at the forefront of the ongoing enterprise transition from the on-premise service delivery model to a cloud-based model. The company's cloud is currently the fastest growing - Microsoft's cloud revenue grew 106% during the last quarter, the only major public cloud to record triple-digit growth. Microsoft's cloud revenue, which consists of Azure, Dynamics CRM and Office 365, brought in revenue of $1.575 billion during the quarter, placing it on an annual run-rate of $6.3 billion. There's an article that I recently published on Seeking Alpha wherein I discussed the revenue and gross margins of the three different components of Microsoft's cloud. I worked out the revenue and gross margins during the quarter for as follows: Office 365 - revenue of $0.409 billion; gross margin of 55% Dynamics CRM - revenue of $0.570 billion; gross margin of 75% You will notice that Office 365 currently has the lowest gross margin among the three Microsoft cloud segments. This probably has something to do with the fact that Office 365 comes with several perks including 27GB free OneDrive storage; 60 Skype minutes per month for landline calls and free web hosting with applicable tools. Considering that Microsoft offers free OneDrive storage for the first 15GB and $1.99/month for the next 20GB, the company could be potentially foregoing tens of millions of dollars on the free 27GB OneDrive storage offer for Office 365 every quarter. A single Home Premium version of Office 365 also can be shared by up to five users. This means that many homes probably only use a single copy of the product. Barron's, however, pointed out that gross margins for Office 365 are likely to gradually rise to approach the 70%-80% gross margins that are typical of SaaS companies. Microsoft has big cloud ambitions. The company recently revealed that it has a target to reach $20 billion in annual cloud revenues by 2018. Considering that Microsoft's cloud is currently on a $6.3 billion annual run-rate, this means that the company is banking on its cloud to maintain a 47% CAGR through 2018. This is easier said than done since the law of large numbers catches up with you rather quickly when you grow that big. At that level, Microsoft's Dynamics CRM division alone will be about 30% bigger than Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM ), the largest CRM company. For this kind of growth to become a reality, all the three components of Microsoft's cloud have to be firing on all cylinders. Microsoft does not usually break down the individual cloud components. To arrive at those revenue figures, I used the cloud growth figures provided by Synergy Research for Azure and Microsoft's CRM market share provided by Gartner to estimate the revenue of Dynamics CRM. Microsoft, however, does provide the number of subscriptions for Office 365. The company said that it finished the quarter with 12.4 million Office 365 subscribers. Viewed in isolation, that number looks impressive. But when you dig a bit deeper, you start realizing that it's nowhere nearly as impressive as it first appears to be. For starters, the number of subscribers grew just 35%, which is probably a good indicator of revenue growth for the segment. 35% revenue growth means that Office 365 grew much slower than either Azure or Dynamics CRM. Microsoft revealed in 2013 that it had about 250 million OneDrive subscribers, of which about 25% were paying customers (subscribers with more than 15GB of storage). Given the robust growth of Azure, OneDrive subscribers could have hit the 350-400 million mark by now, or close to 90 million paying customers. 12.4 million Office 365 subscribers pales in comparison to this figure. After all, Microsoft typically sells hundreds of millions of new Windows OS copies every year. It's quite clear that Microsoft still has plenty of room to run as far as the adoption of Office 365 goes. The move by the company to offer a private link to Office 365 appears to be targeted at netting more enterprise customers. Despite the rapid uptake of cloud services by enterprise customers, security issues are still cited by many as the biggest reason why they are reluctant to shift entire workloads to the cloud. A private link to Equinix's cloud exchange for Office 365 will eliminate most of these worries for this group of customers. Organizations already use Microsoft's AzureConnect to build their hybrid clouds. The new private link now allows them to access one of Microsoft's most popular products in a much more secure and reliable way. It's very likely that Microsoft will soon roll out private link services for its other cloud products as well in a bid to accelerate cloud adoption in order for the company to realize its ambitious cloud goals.
