Microsoft: When Buy And Hold Fails - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Buy-and-hold investing with reinvested dividends has the potential to reward the patient investor with fantastic compounding growth over time. If the investor's timeline is long enough, time can often heal poorly timed buy-ins, but this is not guaranteed. I am a fairly conservative, value-oriented dividend growth investor. I like beaten-down blue chips, low P/E ratios, 3-4% yields with a history of annual increases, buying with the intent of holding for life and dollar cost averaging techniques. I find myself frequently challenged by investors with other strategies, particularly folks in the momentum-growth camp. I originally performed the research for this article based on a challenge. I was motivated by a comment I observed from a momentum growth investor criticizing the buy-and-hold investing strategy. I have heard Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) touted as a frequent example of the flaws of buy-and-hold investing strategy. The argument posed is simple: Investors who bought Microsoft in 1999 and held until 2014 saw no return on their investment. I've heard that argument before, an argument I was able to effectively tear down in the case of ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP ). Investors who make such claims often conveniently forget to account for dividend reinvestments, spin-offs and special distributions ... stock price charts lie when we are talking about strong dividend stocks such as Microsoft. The research that follows is my attempt to dismantle this assumed lie, fully expecting to find that Microsoft performed adequately for investors who bought in at any historical price as long as they reinvested their dividends due to the company's strong dividend growth. What I found surprised me. Before the tech bubble burst in 2000, Microsoft was priced to perfection. On December 27, 1999, MSFT closed at an all-time high of $119.125/share. Microsoft's diluted EPS for the previous four quarters ending December 31, 1999, was $0.35, $0.40, $0.40 and $0.44, respectively, giving it a nosebleed P/E ratio of 75x. Of course, stock price charts don't tell the whole story. Microsoft began paying dividends in 2003. If a hypothetical investor reinvested their dividends, they would have had dozens of automatic buy-ins of Microsoft stock well below their initial purchase price, slowly whittling down the average cost into something much more manageable over time. Or so I thought. **Dividends assumed to be reinvested at Closing Price For this exercise, I assumed our hypothetical investor purchased $50,000 worth of Microsoft at its all-time high closing price of $119.125/share. This would have purchased 419.7271773 shares of Microsoft stock. After enduring one 2-for-1 split in 2003 and 49 separate dividend reinvestments, without a single additional dollar of capital added to the initial purchase, our hypothetical investor would own 1,209.231929 shares of MSFT today. At Thursday's closing price of $52.05/share, our hypothetical investor's investment is worth $62,940.52. This means our hypothetical investor is still in the hole from their initial buy-in in terms of purchasing power! A Fantastic Growth Story With A Stagnating Stock Price On December 27, 1999, Microsoft closed at its apex of $119.125/share. On December 20, 2000, MSFT closed at $41.50/share. In less than a year, Microsoft lost over 65% of its value. The company stayed range-bound from 2000 all the way to 2013, where it finally began breaking toward new highs. Despite poor stock performance, the underlying business engine was humming along. Microsoft continually posted impressive growth numbers throughout this time period. Revenues increased YoY every single year except 2009, where they slipped a mere -3.28% as the world crashed down around us. Income and EPS have been a steady trek upward. 2015 saw earnings contractions, but they were due to a one-time impairment. Only three times has impairment shown up on Microsoft's balance sheet since 1996. This negative income does not appear in 2016, which is why Microsoft currently trades with a forward P/E of 16.4x as per Morningstar. This reliable, stellar growth allowed Microsoft to routinely increase its dividend. Some wounds are too deep to be healed during our lifetimes, and sometimes companies completely fold up shop and go to $0. Buying and holding is never enough on its own and must be combined with other techniques to be successful long term. For a buy-and-hold strategy to be effective, the investment must be purchased at a reasonable price. This can be done effectively using two well-known methods: Using value investing techniques to assess a margin of safety. If the margin of safety is sufficient, a single large lump sum with dividends reinvested over time has a better chance of delivering superior returns. Using dollar cost averaging to slowly build a position over time. Dollar cost averaging is also effective at recovering from point number one if the initial investment was not valued accurately enough by lowering the average cost of ownership of each share. If our hypothetical investor invested the $50,000 on December 20, 2000, merely a year later, the very same portfolio would be worth a healthy $180,669.63 for a CAGR of 8.81%. Not stellar returns, but adequate - even after the tech bubble collapsed, Microsoft still carried a high value. Today's Microsoft is a very different animal. Because of the 15 years of flat stock performance, I believe there is a market perception that MSFT hasn't grown much as a company since the tech bubble, especially when compared to its biggest competitor, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), which has seen tremendous stock price appreciation. As shown with the charts above, that is not the case. Increases in revenues and earnings have been staggering since 1999, but the stock price has lagged because a massive bridge had to be built in the valuation gap from then until now. Today, Microsoft trades at a forward P/E of 16.4x, has a healthy 2.77% dividend, exceptional revenue growth that has increased 8.3% over the past three years and a below industry average debt/equity ratio of 0.5. While I do not believe Microsoft is a deep value play at current prices, it does appear to be reasonably priced for a long-term investor who believes in the company's future and would like to go long. For those looking to establish a long-term position with less risk, Microsoft does offer a Direct Stock Purchase Plan as well. Disclosure: I am/we are long MSFT, AAPL.
