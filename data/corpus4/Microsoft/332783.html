US Government 'Asks' Tech Companies To Tweak Algos, Promote Certain Content | Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site!

Submitted by Mike Krieger via Liberty Blitzkrieg blog, You probably had no idea, but representatives from Silicon Valley, Hollywood and the U.S. government came together earlier this week to privately discuss how they could jointly fight ISIS propaganda online. Never mind the fact that ISIS is the child of reckless and inhumane preemptive wars of aggression perpetrated by the U.S. government. Such introspection naturally never crosses the mind of government bureaucrats ostensibly attempting to understand the epic disasters they created in the first place. So who attended the meeting? We don’t know for sure because the plebes aren’t entitled to know such things. Fortunately, we have become privy to some information thanks to Buzzfeed News . Here’s what we learned: WASHINGTON, D.C. — They flew in from New York, San Francisco, and Los Angeles to hole up in a windowless D.C. conference room for nearly five hours on Wednesday — representatives of the country’s top tech and entertainment companies brainstorming with U.S. counterterrorism officials to tackle one tough question: how to stop the spread of ISIS online. The standoff between Apple and the FBI did not come up during the meeting, though the issues it involves are at the heart of the very things being discussed. As the role of technology in our lives continues its explosive growth, how will the balance between privacy and security play out in the new Silicon Valley-D.C. relationship? “They wanted to figure out how to fight ISIS online, how to understand the psychology of those who support ISIS, and they invited almost no one who speaks for those of us in the Arab world, and from Arab communities, who have everything to lose from ISIS’s growing popularity,” said one Arab attendee, who estimated that less than 10% of the attendants were of Middle Eastern descent. “They don’t understand this community. That has been proven time and time again with their tone deaf messages. Why hold an event like this where there are ten white men outnumbering every Arab?” The lack of voices from the Middle East at the event was raised repeatedly, with one attendee garnering applause when they asked why — in a discussion regarding ISIS’s appeal to young Arab-American Muslims — there was no one speaking to their appeal from within that community. This is what happens when people fail upward and you have a country run by a cadre of incompetent, corrupt and clueless “elites.” Other media outlets, who were  leaked  a list of attendees, revealed that Microsoft, Facebook, Apple, Google, Mediacom, and Edelman were among those attending from Hollywood and Silicon Valley. In a statement, the Department of Justice noted that Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Carlin, U.S. Chief Technology Officer Megan Smith, and Senior Director for Counterterrorism on the National Security Council Staff Jen Easterly all took part in the meeting. Over the last year, the government has stepped up its overtures to Silicon Valley,  meeting with tech executives in January  on the subject of combatting ISIS online. The Department of Defense has opened an office in the San Francisco area, and the State Department has recently appointed its first representative to Silicon Valley. Tech executives who have met with the Pentagon team told BuzzFeed News that some of their requests have been “jarring.” In at least one case, the Pentagon spoke with several companies — who asked not to be named as a condition of discussing the meeting with BuzzFeed News — about tweaking their algorithms to promote certain types of content. Both Google and Facebook have made it clear that they would  not make changes  to their algorithms to bury results supportive of ISIS. “That’s something that is always brought up in meetings. And it shows how little they understand us,” said the Google representative. “This is a Pandora’s box we won’t open, because if we answer a request by the U.S. government to feature one search result over another, what’s to stop other countries from requesting the same? What’s to stop each country from tailoring the search results of their citizens to their agenda? It’s not a path we are willing to explore.” Read that again. It’s always brought up at meetings. Perfect example of why Apple needs to be supported in its battle with the FBI. The U.S. government wants nothing short of total control.

Sat, 02/27/2016 - 19:36 | 7245270 philipat The easiest way to stop the spread of ISIS is to stop funding it. Then all the refugees can go home as well, solving several problems at the same time. There you go Pentagon, fixed it for ya.... Sat, 02/27/2016 - 20:34 | 7245472 too_big_to_fail What was not said is that the US GOV asked Google to tweak the videos and pages from Youtube and Google for WW3, NWO, New World Order, Economic collapse, Dollar Collapse, Negative interest rates. I have been searching these on youtube for over a year, and in the last few months the videos and news articles have disapeared. ISIS my ass, It is censorship about what is really going on.  NWO used to be 5k-10k videos per month, now virtually none.  Freedom of speach my ass, we will let you see what we want you to see, and private companies be dammed, follow orders or else. Sat, 02/27/2016 - 19:30 | 7245248 Truth Eater Its real easy to figure this one out.  Want to stop ISIS?  Nuke Erdogan and his supporters.  Wipe out Saudi Arabia and the bands overruning Libya.  Let Russia finish off the savages in Syria and Iraq.  Expel all muslims from western countries. Sat, 02/27/2016 - 20:23 | 7245431 uhland62 It may actually be better to let ISIS cook because if you were to eliminate them, it would be the threat from China that would take pride of centre place. That's is not a fight that we can win, and therefore letting ISIS simmer is the lesser evil. It also means that it attracts undesirables from all over the world where they can be better eliminated. I rather abstain from a comment about Erdogan, but nuking means to contaminate a place for a long time and then more Turks would come to Germany. The alliance could become dysfunctional with millions of Turks fleeing a contaminated area. He ought to pushed off the perch with less longlasting damage.   Sat, 02/27/2016 - 19:33 | 7245252 Buckaroo Banzai Obama has spent the last seven years cleaning out the General officer corps of the politically incorrect, the politically unreliable, and the politically undesirable. We've got a (literal) faggot in charge of the Army, and a Secretary of the Navy who has spent the better part of a decade striving to float the world's first navy without actual ships. Should we be at all surprised that the wide variety of defense department intelligence agencies might have been similarly "repurposed" in such a way to undermine the interests of the American people? Sat, 02/27/2016 - 19:59 | 7245350 HRH of Aquitaine The last time I checked the oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies didn't have an end date.  Just sayin. Sat, 02/27/2016 - 20:18 | 7245411 Buckaroo Banzai What I find despicable is that Google, Apple, and Microsoft have been rolling over for the Feds for 15 years. Now, all of a sudden, they grow a spine when the Feds come to them about ISIS? Why would anyone want to protect ISIS?
