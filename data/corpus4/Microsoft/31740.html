Facebook: WhatsApp Can Duplicate The Financial Success Of Skype - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha WhatsApp touts 800 million monthly active users. At the current growth rate, WhatsApp could hit 1 billion monthly active users by end of 2015. At the rate that WhatsApp is growing, I predict that this $19 billion messaging app will hit 1 billion monthly active users by the end of 2015. Jan Koum, Founder and CEO of WhatsApp announced on his Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) page that WhatsApp now enjoys 800 million active users. As per Statista's chart below, WhatsApp only took 3 months to add another 100 million monthly active users from January's 700 million figure. The chart above also says that WhatsApp is adding 1 million active users per day. Since Zuckerberg is not going to use advertisements to monetize the huge population of WhatsApp addicts, the other alternative is to do what Skype does to generate most of its revenue. WhatsApp's huge 600 million user base last year was not monetized properly. Contrary to the strong revenue stream of Skype, WhatsApp only generated $15.921 million in revenue for the first six months of 2014. WhatsApp also incurred a net loss of $232.5 million during the same period. The substantial net loss is due to the $206.5 million loss incurred via share-based compensation expenses and common stocks issued at below fair value. Nevertheless, if we assume that WhatsApp made $35 million in FY 2014 revenue from its paying subscribers, it would still be peanuts compared to what Skype makes from selling Skype Credits. WhatsApp has implemented voice calling for Android last month and will also implement the said feature soon on iOS and Windows devices. Business logic says Zuckerberg will charge fees for international voice/video calls on WhatsApp much like Skype does right now . The twist is that Zuckerberg won't allow ads to annoy WhatsApp users. Free users of Skype are now bombarded by Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) ads. This no-ads policy could further accelerate the rapid growth of WhatsApp's number of global active users. Zuckerberg insisted last year that WhatsApp is worth more than $19 billion . He is the boy genius but his valuation of WhatsApp might take some time before it becomes a reality. In theory, my 1 billion monthly active users estimate for 2015 means WhatsApp could deliver around $500 million in revenue by 2017. My revenue projection is from my estimate that 20% (Skype boasted 19% of its 2010 user base were paying subscribers) of WhatsApp's 1 billion active users would sign up for the $0.99/year annual subscription by early 2017. The other $300 million could come from selling international call credits. My $300 million estimate is influenced by Skype's own 2010 revenue of $860 million. This is the year before Microsoft bought Skype so we could assume that the $860 million was not polluted by ad sales. Skype touted 145 million monthly active users by end of 2010. If we calculate the revenue per monthly active user of Skype in 2010, it will come to $5.93. Voice calling is a new feature in WhatsApp and it will take years before people adopt it for international calls. I do not dare use the full $5.93 revenue per active user of Skype to calculate the potential revenue from WhatsApp's future premium voice call service. I therefore guesstimate that $2 revenue per active user is more realistic. I am also assuming that only 15% of my estimated 1 billion WhatsApp active users will use the app to make international calls. The Skype unit of Microsoft (which includes Lync) was already estimated to generate $2 billion in annual sales in 2013. Zuckerberg's claim that WhatsApp is worth more than $19 billion is more realistic once WhatsApp also starts delivering nine-figure revenue numbers. Even at $500 million annual sales, WhatsApp's $19 billion price tag still comes with Price/Sales ratio of 38x. FB trades at a P/S ratio of only 18.14 . A $1 billion/year revenue stream from WhatsApp could still be possible even without mobile advertisements by maximizing the voice/video calling potential of this app. Microsoft has renamed its business-centric Lync messaging app to Skype for Business . The Skype brand is a juggernaut cash generator that Facebook must fully imitate with WhatsApp. My $500 million revenue estimate for 2017 could be higher if Facebook also implements a WhatsApp for Business. WhatsApp's voice calling feature should not only cater to consumers. It should also be positioned as an alternative to Microsoft's Skype for Business. Even though there's a no-ads policy on WhatsApp, some marketing professionals still see WhatsApp as a great tool to interact with consumers and sell products. Even if WhatsApp does not deliver my 2017 estimate of $500 million annual sales, there are still 53 expert analysts at TipRanks who rate FB as a Strong Buy. Those experts have an average 12-month price target of $90.40 for FB. The experts still have a deep faith that Facebook will continue its strong growth momentum .
