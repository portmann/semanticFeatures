How Apple Can Beat Microsoft With Businesses - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple is out with meaningful upgrades to its Pages, Numbers, and Keynote apps. The upgrades are meant to give AAPL more of an SMB/enterprise use-case focus - a key market that the company is now overtly targeting. But this market is defended by a formidable and capable incumbent - Microsoft. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is finally out with its split-screen update for its Pages, Numbers and Keynote apps nearly one month after releasing the newest iteration of its operating system. While not a notable delay between updates, the focus on time here is important in the scheme of things, especially because I believe Apple is in a race against Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) for SMB (small- and medium-size businesses)/enterprise dominance. This race, by the way, is a two-horse race between Apple and Microsoft for market share leadership with Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) possibly entering the fold over time. I just believe that the SMB/enterprise really only has the choice between Apple and Microsoft, at least right now, when it comes to devices and software for executing business functions. No other company has the comprehensiveness of either portfolio, that of devices or software (referring specifically to productivity suite software), at least not yet, to trap an SMB/enterprise within an ecosystem. Of course, both the SMB and the enterprise do have the option of using, and many do choose to use, disparate solutions to address their needs. That said, Apple and Microsoft are in a clear race with each other to complete the missing parts of each company's respective ecosystems. For Microsoft, this largely means devices. For Apple, this largely means software. Yes, Apple fans, despite the company's consumer device dominance (and therefore operating software dominance), AAPL's SMB/enterprise presence from a software standpoint is a hole in its model it's looking to address. The most recent clear evidence of this is Apple's new enterprise-focused iPad and the above-noted paired updates (with its device iterations) to its enterprise-focused software apps. Microsoft, on the other hand, is dominant from an enterprise operating system and productivity suite standpoint, but lacks the device dominance in the enterprise space that Apple has shown on the consumer side and is beginning to show on the enterprise side. Microsoft has a slew of devices - the Surface Pro, the Surface Hub, the Surface Book, etc. - that it has launched or will launch in an effort to begin trying to take device market share. I should state here that I am long Apple common and hold no position in Microsoft. That said, I currently give the upper hand and advantage in the race to "ecosystem completion" to Microsoft. Microsoft has the incumbent advantage of being the software and productivity suite of choice for the enterprise - this attaches to it an incredibly high switching cost. The disruption, or potential disruption, that could be experienced should an enterprise attempt to switch software and productivity suites is huge. Maybe so huge, and history has shown this to prove out, that the enterprise never attempts the switch. I've also seen Microsoft take great strides, unthinkable strides just a few years ago, in building out its device tech and capacity. Microsoft also brings to the table a size and financial capacity that makes it a more than formidable competitor to Apple's usurping attempts. Knowing that, the following is how I would go about siphoning market share if I were Apple. This plan is in no way comprehensive and is open to additions and welcomed criticism in the comments section below: Apple has shown this to be the case in other facets of its business. If it is threatened by a competitor, it either buys the competitor (not likely in the case of Microsoft) or it commoditizes the competitor's advantage, negating the advantage by economically suppressing its competition into submission. By doing this, Apple also gains early adopters (assuming the tech/capacity is new), proliferation in general and branding integrity for the tech/capacity. While the disruption of a software/productivity suite might be great if the financials behind the risk justify the risk, the risk will likely be taken by the SMB/enterprise. This could be an easy way for Apple to "Little Bighorn" the non-consumer space by first starting with SMB market share (where economics would likely be easiest to justify the risk of switching software) and working its way up the non-consumer chain. Commoditization is realistic and is something Apple could control entirely at its device economics. The opposite of the commoditization strategy would be to go "on the offensive". Apple could limit device connectivity for Microsoft software/productivity suite endpoints to its devices. While risky, this strategy could yield huge results. Again, AAPL is dominant on the consumer device side. Apple also, I'm sure, realizes that its devices (using, say, Mail as the example) also facilitate connectivity to several competitor software endpoints (for instance, I have my Outlook and Office 365 email accounts tethered to push to my device). Cutting off all external connectivity would be detrimental to retention as well as forward adoption, but cutting off one point of connectivity I'm not sure would be as harsh to device usage, considering the lack of Apple device users' willingness to switch devices (based on Apple retention data), as many would speculate. Of course, I could be completely wrong. That said, I do think that the loss of access to Microsoft productivity suite software on Apple devices would incentivize users to consider consumer device alternatives to ensure connectivity at all times. Again, I acknowledge the risk of this strategy. I think that replicating is different than commoditization as a standalone strategy. Replicating would mean that Apple create something substantially similar from a software standpoint (this likely would include small changes to devices as well - for instance the installation or pivoting to a standard control function dashboard inclusive of CTRL, FN, ALT, SHIFT) and then commoditizing the product. If there is no substantial shift in "learned behavior" or standard operating procedure of software, I believe the switching cost of software/productivity suites is negated. In fact, OpenOffice has long been a surrogate for Apple's operating system and device users who prefer to have the familiarity of a Microsoft-like platform. With switching cost being the greatest friction provider to the adoption of Apple's software, and with AAPL having what I deem as superior devices (in spectrum and in specifications), I believe this too is a realistic and viable option should Apple consider it. While this is complete speculation, I have to believe this is taking place behind closed doors at Apple. "Refocus" in this context means focusing efforts on shaping the actual software, as it did with the productivity suite upgrades announced, to better meet the needs of the enterprise. For instance, particularly low-hanging fruit might be an optimization of FaceTime for enterprise use-cases. Microsoft recently upgraded Skype to have a Skype for Business capacity that should have it competing with Google Hangouts for video-calling market share. This, in my opinion, is going to be a key enterprise market and platform to win for those looking to lead the productivity suite space. Apple could presumably update FaceTime to leverage a device advantage. But Apple, in all its creativity and innovation, I'm sure has many upgrades and fixes planned that I'm sure will do just what I've proposed for FaceTime. Still, I did want to note that a refocus of priorities or a parallel focus of priorities from all consumer to that of consumer and enterprise would be a great launch pad for market share take. We won't know for a while who eventually wins out as the SMB/enterprise leader, but this race is sure to have plenty of twists and turns along the way. Hopefully, as often competition does, it leads to much improved overall tech and capacity for those of us depending on these solutions to drive business outcomes. Normally, I think it would be safe to bet on Apple to be the winner of any contest it takes seriously. That might be the case here as well. But there is no denying the Microsoft's incumbent advantage afforded to it by its software. In my opinion, Microsoft - and please feel free to disagree in the comments section - has an easier route to spatial dominance in that I believe it can take smaller, less risky steps to upset the competitive dynamic (in taking device market share).
