ETF Hub Oct 23 2015, 18:47 ET | About: Apple Inc. (AAPL) | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Apple ( AAPL +3.1%) is nearing the release of its Android app for Apple Music, judging from a German mobile site that has gotten hold of screenshots and says some users are in private beta. It would mark just the second time the company officially released an Android app -- and the other one was a tool to migrate data to iOS devices from Android devices. The company had said in its June launch that an Android app for Apple Music would be coming at some point this fall. On Tuesday, Apple chief Tim Cook said Apple Music had 15M users , 6.5M of which were paying subscribers. $1 billion in revenues at $10 APRU means they have to get 100 million subscribers. They have to get 94 million more subscribers! Good luck... Apple's moves into recurrent revenue streams should not be overlooked. Apple Music, AppleCare+, the iPhone upgrade program, and the new AppleTV AppStore are but a few ways Apple management is clearly moving to a more consistent, less volatile revenue cycle. IMHO, this bodes well for stockholders. If this is true, and I hope it is, it's analogous to Apple crossing the line more than a decade ago with iTunes for Windows - a Trojan horse dragged deep into the opposition's home base. Suddenly the variously-interpreted solid or lacklustre Apple Music launch gets a new set of numbers.... I am willing to pay for a subscription based ad-free streaming music service with a decent (deep) library.Apple music does not enchant; I am audioning Tidal and will likely sign up. My wife dropped on me two days ago that she's decided to subscribe to Apple Music now that her trial period is up. She's switching over from Pandora, and the hook for her was the music discovery service. She said the UI was kind of confusing at first but she was fine after she got used to it. Gregg, I'm not stalking you, I just happened to have finally gotten around to reading your excellent blog post and made a couple comments there.  But now you have me thinking about how Apple Music connects (or doesn't) to what you have said about the company. I subscribe to Apple Music.  I use it. I enjoy it.  Having said that I can't for the life of me figure out what Apple is thinking with its design of iTunes to begin with and with the new iTunes and Apple Music monster they have created currently. Design at this level is not arbitrary.  They had some philosophy or goals in mind when they made the decisions they did.  But I can't for the life of me figure out what they were. I once read a book that suggested the problem with Microsoft Office (specifically Excel) was that the toolbar was developed by the marketing department and not by the users.  The thinking goes the toolbar (and later ribbon, which was even worse) was designed to show off all of Office's gee whiz features and not for the person who would actually have to select among them in the course of daily productivity. That made some sense to me and got me to be a lot less hostile toward the product.  I just gritted my teeth and invested the time to customize the thing for my workflow.  After that I had a lot fewer problems and was less puzzled by the whole sloppiness of the original design. But I can't bring even that explanation to Apple Music and come away with any satisfaction.  Because I can't figure out even what gee whiz features they might be trying to show case if that were the point of the design. How does this tie in with your excellent description of Apple?  I don't see much of the addictive reinforcement taking place because I've been too often reduced to poking at things in blind frustration.  I was a hobbyist programmer for many years and I know enough about toolbar design as a developer and as user to really admire when something is where it ought to be.  Save me clicks, or save me thinking, or grab the brass ring and do both at once.  I love a well designed program.  Like we all do, of course. But what was iTunes and why did they go ahead an lay another blanket of fog on top of it with Apple Music? I have poked around enough to learn how to get it to perform some basic functions that are the ones I need.  But I have no idea why I must choose the items I do and there are still things I'd like to do that I haven't figured out. You say that software shapes the brain.  Well they seem to want to assume I think of music in playlists and if I don't, I'm pretty well out of luck. The way I actually think of music is the way I was trained in my youth.  Select a song or album, listen to it, and then think of what I want to listen to next.  Listen to that. I do like the singer-songwriter channel and have discovered new music with that.  And that music discovery experience was what made me conclude it was worth paying for.  So maybe that particular experience fits with your description of Apple as selling experience.  But the rest of the software is to brain training as The Rack is to Yoga. Hi DM, I've used iTunes and it is a monstrosity. I think even Apple lovers hate it. I definitely think Apple's application level software is often not up to snuff in terms of experiences, unlike the OS's. I don't know why exactly. I have led software teams and know software UI design is extremely difficult and tricky and time consuming. One WAG I have is that the OS level is so important to Apple that it takes the air out of the room, in terms of using all the attention of their A-team of UX people and designers, leaving the application software to be designed by the B and C teams. An enlightening question about this recent product cycle. Which team do you think got the best talent: the iOS 9 team, the Mac OS team, the Apple TV OS team, the Watch OS team or the Apple Music team? Companies aren't monolithic and there's only so much talent (and executive attention) to go around in even the best company. My guess is Apple Music was at the bottom of the pecking order. There's no defending several of the application level UX designs, IMO. This is not a new thing and goes way back, I think. I can guess it is probably because Jobs personally invested his time in the OS and infrastructure of the computing and didn't personally immerse himself in many of the applications being created by Apple, kind of sending a message to the organization about where it was important to focus their best efforts. Apple Music is independent of ecosystem, and Siri. The appeal is, tremendous library, ease of search, human curation, live radio, and on and on... At David, personal taste perhaps. There isn't a great deal of difference between the two in terms of function or content. It's a threat to Spotify anyway you slice it. I am a user of both AM and Spotify. I have noticed lately that Spotify is missing a lot of the artists that I like to listen to while AM has them There's also a segment of true music buffs who really like Beats 1 radio, which does a lot of artist interviews and music history type stuff. I think part of Apple's strategy is to lead with this segment, with the hope that they are influencers.
