Is Google's Android The Next PC Platform? - Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) | Seeking Alpha Google has released a developer preview of its next version of Android, N. Android N features split screen multitasking, similar to Windows 10 and iOS. Alphabet's Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) has released a developer preview of the next generation Android N. The most important new feature of Android N is split screen multitasking very similar to what is already implemented for Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Win10 tablets and Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iOS for iPad. Android N underscores the growing importance of mobile devices as general purpose personal computing platforms. Of the three operating systems, Android may be best-positioned to become the ubiquitous commodity PC platform of the future. Initial takes on Android N have been very favorable, with articles in Anandtech and Ars Technica complementing the implementation of the split screen approach in Android N. While everyone recognizes that there are bugs, this is after all a developer beta. It was a little surprising that Google released this ahead of Google IO in May, but apparently Google wants to get some developer feedback on N before the conference starts. Since rumors first appeared that Google was working on a "converged" version of Android that would incorporate or absorb Chrome OS, it's been apparent that Android would need some form of multitasking, as I wrote in Sundar Pichai's Very Good Call : . . . Android already works very well as a desktop replacement. Plug in a mouse, keyboard and external monitor, and you're good to go. The mouse pointer appears automatically. Android doesn't normally display apps in multiple windows, or in a split screen view as in the new iOS 9, but clearly something along those lines will be needed in the future converged OS. I'm sure it's in the works. That Google has built split screen multitasking into the very next version of Android confirms that I was on the right track in my take on the Android/Chrome OS convergence rumor. Android is being positioned to be not merely the mobile OS of the next billion(s), but the PC OS of them as well. Meanwhile, Chrome will fade into history. In my recent article, Why Microsoft Must Kill Off The Legacy Windows Ecosystem , I contended that the competitors of Windows 10 are the mobile device ecosystems of Android and iOS. That may have been a little jarring to Wintel fans, but this is the competitive reality driving Microsoft to adopt other features of its competitors' business models, especially the app store distribution model. For the most part, the generalization of the mobile OS to a PC platform needs to occur on a fairly large touchscreen format, phablet or tablet. The early takes on Android N confirms N as a big step forward for Android in the tablet space. It allows Android to make better use of the screen real estate, and many apps that are scaled up smartphone apps end up working pretty well visually in split screen mode. As to why I believe that Android has the best chance of being the dominant personal computing platform of the future, it's really because of the business model. It all about commoditization. Google took the PC commodity model and went Microsoft one better by distributing the OS for free (or almost for free), relying on ad revenue and an app store to generate revenue from Android. The Android business model also relied on inexpensive commodity hardware from a variety of vendors, which Google's licensing of Android encouraged. The success of this model hinged on Android getting into as many hands as possible. Android now has over a billion active users, and is looking at billions more in emerging markets such as India and Southeast Asia. With well developed app store and ad revenue streams, Google can continue to fund the expansion of Android into adjacent markets, as well as smartphones, and the personal computing market is a very logical target. Here, I see Microsoft as being pretty vulnerable. It's struggling to adapt its OS and OEM licensing model to the new reality of "free" mobile operating systems such as Android and iOS. Microsoft still doesn't have much of an app store for Windows 10, and not much search advertising revenue either. Most importantly, Microsoft's Nokia smartphone business has more or less imploded. Microsoft's Continuum feature and new phones such as the HP Elite x3 may reverse this , but for the moment Microsoft has almost no presence in the most important personal computing platform today in terms of usage. This is an open door for Android to walk in and recruit users out of the legacy Windows ecosystem. And what of iOS? Apple recently announced that it now has 1 billion devices in use for all of its various platforms, including Mac OS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS. The number of iOS users is debatable, but it's probably greater than 600 million, given that many users have more than one Apple device. Apple has a sizable ecosystem in iOS, but it's clear that it's never going to try to become a commodity player. Apple will keep itself positioned in the premium price tier, where the profits are. But this also means that Apple will continue to build in more and more functionality into iOS and iOS devices, as Phil Schiller Apple's SVP of Worldwide Product Marketing has enumerated . Apple's development of split screen multitasking for iOS 9 and the new iPad Pro demonstrate that Apple is starting to target the traditional PC market as well. In short, I see Android trying to take over the commodity PC market, with Microsoft bearing the brunt of Android market share gains in the coming years. Microsoft still has a powerful incumbency advantage, so I don't count Microsoft out, but I do see the battle primarily between Windows and Android. Based on what happened with Windows phone, which was another battle between commodity business models, I give the advantage to Android. Google hasn't completely seized the initiative with Android N. After all, iOS 9 introduced split screen multitasking last year. Apple's market share losses for iPad demonstrate that Apple still has a problem, however, which Android N will not help. General consensus has been that iPad Pro plus iOS 9 multitasking didn't quite achieve the productivity level of Microsoft's Surface Pro. Apple can still position iOS as it's alternative personal computing platform, but it will need to double down on productivity. We'll probably see more progress along those lines at WWDC this June. Both Apple and Alphabet are increasing the total addressable market for their mobile platforms, and will probably do so at Microsoft's expense. I rate Microsoft a hold and Apple and Google buys.
