Amazon Web Services: The New Face Of Tech Giant's Profitability - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Amazon Web Services is now officially the highest operating income earner for the company. The CFO says margins may be bumpy moving forward. I add that they won't show any significant decline because of a key factor. As Amazon Web Services takes over the responsibility of EPS growth for the foreseeable future, it will boost market confidence in the company's high valuation. More than two months ago, on February 23, I wrote an article called "Amazon Web Services: Holding The Profitability Bag For Amazon". In that article, I spoke about why I thought AWS would soon become the highest earner (by operating income) for Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) at the pace it was growing. My reasons were simple: the company's cloud unit was growing along with the industry at double-digit levels with very high margins of over 20%, while the retail business was continuing to see a fraction of that filtering down to the bottom line. But to be honest, even I did not expect AWS would overtake Amazon's North America segment in as little as one quarter. As of Q1-2016, it officially leapfrogged over Amazon's domestic retail business to become the lead operating income earner for the company. Despite healthy overall sales growing across all three segments - North America revenue grew by 27%, and International revenue grew by 24% - it was the 64% growth in AWS that has bought in ample breathing space for Amazon's overall bottom line. So AWS, which accounted for a mere 8.81% of total revenue, is now responsible for more than 50% of the company's operating income as of Q1-2016. But even in its two retail segments, the company has seen slight improvements in its operating margins. Are These Stellar Margins Temporary? Amazon recorded a healthy 23.5% operating margin in AWS, but the company is not very confident of maintaining that high level moving forward. During the Q1 earnings call, CFO Brian T. Olsavsky said: "We're very pleased with the quarter, we came in at 23.5% operating margin - the new basis including stock-based compensation and other. We're very pleased. But stepping back with the 64% growth in AWS which is now a $10 billion business, but on the margin side, I would caution you that we're pleased, but it is very early to start drawing too many conclusions on the long-term margins in this business, they'll be bumpy over time." I agree with that assertion that the current margin levels in excess of 20% might be a hard one to hold due to the fluid nature of an industry that is seeing a four-way competition between IBM Corp. (NYSE: IBM ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Amazon and Google ( GOOG , GOOGL ). However, a deeper dive into the continual launches of high-value services around the core cloud offering tells me that might not be the case. Investor-speak: Why Bumpy - Not Declining - Margins? As you might know, AWS has already cut prices over 50 times. So, how do its margins continue to stay above the 20% level despite that? The answer is in those services I mentioned. A quick look at Amazon's re:invent for the last two years will tell you how quickly its offerings are expanding in the cloud space. To put it simply, the company is trying to simplify the job of technology teams and turning it into income for itself. Amazon Kinesis Firehose: To Stream data into the cloud Amazon Inspector: For Security and Compliance I understand these are services that many of us have never heard of before, but the point is that Amazon keeps adding to its features list - and every new introduction makes it that much easier to operate in a cloud environment. That's the main reason the company's been able to sustain its margins despite the ongoing price war with the other cloud providers, and that's why I'm confident that as long as it keeps introducing value-added services to its cloud ecosystem, it will continue to see high margins for AWS. Yes, it will be bumpy as new revenues play catch-up with deep discounting practices, but I don't see the margins shrinking anytime soon. That's going to be a big boost for Amazon stock prices. The company will now show consistent profitability; but more importantly, at least one segment has finally stepped up to fill the gap between reality and high valuation. From now on, the burden of EPS is squarely on AWS's shoulders, and retail has the breathing space it needs to become consistently and significantly profitable over time. As I advised earlier today in my article about investing in Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), a dollar-cost averaging approach would be the right one with AMZN as well. These are stocks where high valuation is gradually being justified through greater profitability (Amazon) and new revenue streams (Facebook), so you should definitely look at owning your piece of these companies as they grow to maturity and grow into their current valuations.
