Microsoft's Steady Progress In Tablets Is Impressive - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha For years, the iPad ruled the tablet space. Android-based tablets then took the market by storm by displacing the iPad as the volume leader. Microsoft was late to the game but its Surface line and Windows-based equivalents have the best prospects for growth over the next several years. Remember when the iPad was all the rage and pundits wrote off the Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Surface entry as a DOA? Back in the fall of 2013 I wrote a piece describing why the then new Surface mattered to Microsoft and why it should matter to investors. At the time the overwhelming number of comments laughed at the Surface and exalted the merits of the then popular iPad. The world has changed a bit since then. The iPad has been in a secular decline with its worldwide market share falling steadily from the 60% range in 2012 to the 25% range today. What most people have not noticed is the parallel growth of Windows based tablets including the Surface, augmented by two-in-one designs from traditional Windows assemblers like HP, Asus, Acer and Lenovo. For its part, Microsoft's own Surface line shipped some 6 million units in 2015 with forecasts of 8 million units for 2016. Total Windows-based tablets also are growing quickly. Strategy Analytics sees Windows based tablets taking 18% of the market in 2019, up from 10% today, while the venerable iPad languishes at around 23% of the market. IDC sees a somewhat similar picture, assigning a 30% growth rate to Windows based tablets and two-in-one devices through 2019 while forecasting no growth to speak of for either iPad's or Android tablets. Microsoft's approach to the tablet market has been slow and steady with a solid vision of the way a robust Windows 10 platform designed to support all form factors can energize both assemblers and developers. That strategy is paying off and Microsoft is both excited and pleased by the growth of its applications library in the Windows store. The number of Windows applications is now approaching 700,000 . More importantly, the quality of the Windows applications library rivals all competitors. There seems little doubt that Microsoft Windows-based tablets over time will emerge as a major player in the tablet space with the potential to equal the iPad's acceptance over time. In my view, Microsoft is a premier name in the technology space with plenty of room to continue to grow profitably under the strong leader of Satya Nadella. Long-term investors should include Microsoft in their technology portfolio.
