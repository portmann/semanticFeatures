You Missed The Boat On Netflix - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Netflix will continue to lead the online TV content industry over the next few years, and earnings will likely continue to grow. How much does Netflix need to grow to rationalize today's market capitalization as fairly valued? Despite Netflix's large moat, they still have many threats that could impact future growth; these include competition and legal issues. Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) is a company I think has the potential to lead the market in earnings growth over the next few years. Netflix has established a growing moat in the online television market, and very possibly could become a standard household item in much of the developed world. Netflix is leading the worldwide revolution away from live television, one that I believe will continue to pick up steam in the next few years. It would be extremely unreasonable to think that Netflix will do anything but grow over the next few years; I am not attempting to argue against this in this article. The question is how much can Netflix actually grow? And can Netflix justify its current valuation? Unfortunately, after doing my research it seems like you may have missed the boat by at least a year. It is not secret that it is eventually possible to obtain pirated video of almost anything online, and is it a constant battle to shut them down. One ongoing threat to Netflix is the large number of people that would choose pirated content over paying for Netflix. The only variables that would make this change with time would be a change in availability and consequences of illegal use of pirated content, or a change in the quality/quantity of Netflix content relative to the price. These variables seem somewhat difficult and speculative to predict, so I won't discuss it further in this article. As many of you are already aware, copyright laws are country specific , and therefore content is bought specifically for viewing within that country. With the United States being the home-base for Netflix, naturally it has by far the largest selection of content; in fact no other country can even come close. This created a market for various technology that basically tricks Netflix into thinking you are in a different country (typically the US), and allows people access to this region's Netflix content anywhere in the world. Netflix has addressed this issue in the past , and has discouraged it, despite not really doing anything about it. It is very clear that this has led to more growth in sales for the company at the expense of the companies they are doing business with. I know a large number of Canadians that simply would not use Netflix if the US content was blocked; it wouldn't really seem worth the money for many people. It is only a matter of time before the entertainment industry turns on Netflix, and demands some sort of a solution that would likely cost Netflix money. Let's look at Canada, with over 3.5 million Netflix accounts, which is almost proportionately the same as the United States, and is the second largest user-base. According to one source , approximately one third (over a milllion) Canadian subscribers use US Netflix. I also imagine this practice would be the most common in Canada, which tends to have very similar interests in television shows. However it is important to consider that this will likely be addressed in the future, and it will not be favorable for Netflix as it will either result in them paying more for content, or a decline in international users. It is also important to consider that the country specific content does not really allow for as much scale as one would expect from an internet based company, as the country specific negotiating would be somewhat comparable to traditional TV networks. The obvious threat to Netflix is another company coming in and doing exactly what they are doing. Netflix has the advantage of a huge loyal user-base because it was the first of its kind, however, there is nothing proprietary about what they are doing. Any company with a lot of money can move into this market, and many already have such as Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), HULU, and Time Warner's (NYSE: TWX ) HBO. When it comes to the business of streaming TV content, companies need to go big or go home; getting a few decent television shows and selling a subscription service will not be successful, and so far it hasn't been. To date, there has been no real threat to Netflix's niche, however, Netflix continually moves into other niches (such as HULU's). Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is the one threat to Netflix that cannot be taken lightly. To make this simple, if Apple decided to go seriously into TV streaming, I believe that they would eventually crush Netflix if they wanted to. You can say what you want about the loyal user-base, but if Apple comes along with its seemingly endless quantity of cash (and strong and consistent earnings) and invests significantly into content, Netflix would have no chance. This would be made even worse as it would create a bidding war for content, something that Netflix has not had to deal with too much as of yet. Apple would have no problem paying to get top quality content, and then sell it at a reduced rate for a couple of years to put Netflix out of business. On the other hand Apple already has a large number of different product classes, and has been heavily researching other huge industries (such as the automobile industry); it would not be wise for Apple to spread themselves too thin, so we will have to see how this plays out. Trying to predict this is also very speculative, and I won't discuss it any further; however, I want to make it clear that Apple is the one threat that could seriously cripple Netflix. Despite all of the hype about Amazon, I do not see them as a significant threat to Netflix. This is because Amazon is already so focused on growth within their current market, I don't think they have the capital to take this project on meaningfully; I personally think that this is a bad move for Amazon, and they could spread themselves too thin. Lets talk about the many positives of Netflix, but first, I want to mention that I have not gone into as much detail in this section as the positives for Netflix have been exhausted in previous articles; this is merely a brief review. First, Netflix has already created a large database of information based on user preferences, which it uses to help select content for its viewers based on their previous interests. Also, Netflix has actually used this data to determine what shows they will try and obtain in the future, as well as ideas for future Netflix original series. This is a truly unique advantage that even the great data miners Facebook and Google would not be able to replicate with the same accuracy. Currently Netflix is the largest player in their market, which has given them an advantage of having the largest library of content; this will naturally allow them to grow at a quicker rate than their competitors. In addition to this, Netflix's original content can be scaled which would significantly improve margins as their user-base grows. Netflix has the advantage of being there first, and this continual advantage with growing market share will spread with time. I personally believe that the majority of smaller online streaming companies will eventually be contracted out by Netflix, although this could take many years. Netflix has created some very high quality television content according to the opinions of viewers, which has added to their loyal following. Netflix is frankly just really trendy. It's hard to value something that is considered trendy, but it certainly must be considered. Netflix is not only fashionable, but has developed an almost cult like following. Many users swear by Netflix, and wouldn't dare touch anything else; this can be compared to the fans of companies such as Apple, although perhaps much less extreme. This loyalty must be valued into the company as we can expect a lower cancellation rate. Netflix management stated that they estimate future revenue, and then use this to determine what they will spend on content; they also stated that they plan to grow revenue more than content over the next few years so that their margins will improve to 40% . I don't find this to be unreasonable at all, but it may prove to be too ambitious of a goal. Management stated that they wish to grow their US base from 60 to 90 million by 2020, which is a pretty big range in my opinion. As of last quarter they had 41.06 million paid US memberships, and it seems very likely that will can achieve 60 million by 2020. However, lets look a little closer at what would have to occur to get to 90 million, to get an idea of managements ambitions. There are just under 320 million people in the United States as of 2014, and there are 123,229 households . Then there are the group quarters which are not included, which as of 2009 was 8,277. Subtracting the prisons from this number, that would be 6,124 group homes, or 129,353 total households and group quarters excluding prisoners (I'm assuming prisoners don't get Netflix, I won't be surprised if this is wrong); lets keep the numbers simple and assume the number of group homes have increased over the last few years to bring the total to 130 million. In order for Netflix to get 90 million viewers, they would need to have 69.2% of US households purchasing Netflix. As of 2012, There are 49.5% of Americans that are receiving some form of social assistance (including veterans benefits and medicaid). There are 27.4% of households that are currently receiving means-tested non-cash benefits; I find it reasonable to say that the majority of these households would be able to afford a luxury such as Netflix, but perhaps I could be wrong. Removing this chunk entirely from the population would require almost 100% of US households that are not dependent on these programs to purchase Netflix. It also seems reasonable that the majority of the 'working poor', (no social-assistance, but living below the poverty line) which represent around 10 million Americans (around 3-4 million households), would also not be purchasing Netflix. There are also the large number of people that are just unlikely to switch over to Netflix because they like watching TV the way that they have always watched it. I imagine the senior population would be much less likely to convert to Netflix, especially since the retirement lifestyle is much more conducive to watching TV shows around a schedule, and they are less likely to have a timetable conflict from lifestyle. Therefore the 40.3 million Americans aged 65 or older are another major problem for Netflix to achieve their almost 70% market-share. Another major consideration is the huge number of people that share their Netflix accounts, and are essentially impossible to stop; Netflix would be much less user-friendly if it could only be accessed from one location, so this trend is likely to continue. Of course there is no data for this, but it seems to be pretty common occurrence in my anecdotal experience. Finally, there are the people that just for whatever reason don't want to watch Netflix. There is still an enormous amount of high quality content that is unavailable on Netflix, so many people would be unlikely to jump ship yet. Some people use TV mostly for news or sporting events. Then there are the odd household that just doesn't watch television at all. I just wanted to use Netflix's example of their US growth targets as a highlight as to why investors may be misled by management's expectations. Of course many of the aforementioned arguments in this section would be applied to other countries, however I wanted to discuss just the US as they specifically made growth targets for the US. In conclusion, I will not be surprised if Netflix hits 60 million US subscriptions by 2020, but I doubt it will be much higher than that. Now to the fun part: the math! I like to determine what sort of expectations investors have for the future by determining what theoretical future revenues would need to be to achieve a reasonable valuation. Lets start with an almost impossible scenario: 1 billion Netflix subscriptions by 2020. Given the prediction for the number of households with televisions to hit 1.72 billion by 2020, it seems possible that over a billion households would have internet, television, and the ability to afford Netflix and a medium to connect Netflix to the television. As of their last quarter, Netflix reported 65 million subscriptions ; they also reported net income of $26.34 million. With 1 billion customers they would therefore increase net income by around 15.4 times the Q2 net income, which would assume profit of around $405.6 million per quarter, or $1.62 billion per year ($3.80 EPS). With a current price of $106.11, this would mean a P/E of 27.92; still very expensive. Just to put this in perspective, some estimates suggest that streaming content revenue will double by 2020 , but this is still a massive gap in Netflix's earnings expectations. Netflix plans on growing their margins to 40% (33.1% last quarter) by 2020 as they expect their content costs to decline relative to their subscription revenue due to growth; I find this to be a realistic goal, and this would increase earnings further. In addition, certain administrative costs will not necessarily grow at the same rate of their content costs and revenue, which will further increase their net income. Lets assume that both of those variables combined increase net income by an additional 40%, which is very generous, this would bring EPS to $5.32, or a P/E of 19.945; STILL expensive. It is also important to consider that the general and administrative and marketing expense will grow significantly as they expand into more countries, so we cannot assume that this expansion will not increase costs; looking at previous statements, it seems that they have been growing somewhat proportionately to the revenue, although management seems to think this will change soon (which would make sense as they have expanded so much recently). Now lets consider this scenario even further, if Netflix actually had 1 billion subscriptions, there would be very little growth left at all, so a much lower P/E ratio would be expected. Just for fun, lets say they increase their subscription rates by 25% without increasing any costs at all. This would bring the P/E down to just below 15, which would be quite fairly priced for a company with reasonable growth expectations; however, if all of the practically impossible criteria were fulfilled, the growth expectations would have to come from improving margins even further. I have read previous analysis that suggested declining cash flow is a concern for Netflix, and I don't entirely agree; I think that this is purely a function of how they are aggressively growing the company, and nothing more. Taking a quick look at the balance sheet, Netflix has 9.6 billion in assets and 7.6 billion in liabilities, leaving only just over 2 billion in equity (with the majority being in common stock). On the other hand, Netflix has 2.3 billion in cash, and very health working capital. The Psychology of Investing In Netflix My favorite part about investing is trying to determine which information sources investors use, how they use them, and how this affects their investment decisions. There are not too many examples that are as perfect as Netflix in displaying how cognitive biases impact our judgment. Netflix is something that the vast majority of Americans and Canadians hear about on a daily basis; we hear about it in the news, we are always talking about it with our friends, and we frequently see the 'Netflix' logo on the background of our computers or televisions. We have associated Netflix with an innovative company of the future, that will likely continue to revolutionize the way that we live our lives. So many of us have witnessed Netflix turn from a rarely used website into an increasingly standard household item in the USA and Canada; logically, we are aware that this trend will continue to occur throughout the rest of the world. Any reasonable person can see the obvious growth potential in Netflix, and we all want a piece of the pie (especially when we missed the likes of Apple and Microsoft in the past). In short, we are constantly thinking about Netflix, and these thoughts are usually very positive. The association of a reward with Netflix, leads to it being associated with other rewarding things, such as generating future cash. There is a growing body of evidence that suggests that we value companies higher when they are more often discussed in the media; this effect has become much stronger with the growth of the investing media and the internet (and the overwhelming amount of information). The absolute best examples of this can be seen during the dot-com bubble, and if there is one global message from this article, it is that there is no better time than now to study this time period. Netflix is a great example of this. Think from your own anecdotal evidence of people you know who are 'casual investors' and hold a few shares in a few companies, but don't really dedicate that much time to them; it's been my experience that these portfolios are filled with the most publicized names in the world (Facebook, Netflix, Amazon, Tesla, Google, etc), and rarely with less famous companies. With retail investing being increasingly more common, and investors having more access to information, I argue that this effect is more pronounced than ever before. There is an illusion of safety when investing in a company such as Netflix, that I think we can all agree will not likely be going bankrupt any time soon; almost anyone can agree there is huge growth potential in earnings. This leads to people to become careless when it comes to looking at valuation, which can, and has countless times in the past, lead to dramatic corrections in price. In contrast, companies that are going through a very difficult time can have much less downside potential as the poor projections are already valued in. The time to buy Netflix was essentially any time up until around a year ago. Ask yourself what was happening with Netflix last year when the price was around half of its current value? Why didn't you buy then? What has occurred, over the last year, that makes it worth twice what it seemed worth last year? When you start asking these questions, the valuation becomes less clear. If there is any one company that is likely to become the world leader in streaming online content, it will be Netflix. To say otherwise at this point would seem unwise, as they have demonstrated a growing moat, as well as a very loyal user-base. Overall, regardless of market-capitalization, Netflix has some of the best earnings growth prospects out there right now. Despite Netflix being a fantastic company, it seems plausible that Netflix could grow earnings over the next few years to become fairly valued with their current priced; it is even theoretically possible for Netflix to grow so much that it is actually under-priced right now. What needs to be considered is the relative risk to reward. What I wanted to demonstrate in this article, is that the current Netflix valuation leaves almost no room for growth; there is just far too many ambitious growth expectations already cooked into the market capitalization, which has resulted in a somewhat scary P/E ratio. Using P/E ratio for a growth company is of little use, however, I question if it is reasonable to project these growth expectations onto Netflix. If Netflix explodes in popularity, grows their margins, eliminates competition, deals with illegal content access, and keeps their marketing and administrative costs in check, then Netflix is likely somewhat fairly valued; if any of these expectations are not met, or if there is any major correction in the market, Netflix has some fairly significant downside. I think that it is too speculative to come up with an accurate value for Netflix right now, but I would be looking at buying Netflix if it fell below $60, and I would be seriously researching it if it ever fell below $50. However, Netflix is a speculative stock, and we are living in an extremely speculative time period; there is nothing to say that investors won't bid Netflix up to $200 next month, but it will just be that much more overvalued. I would recommend considering Netflix for long term put options as a form of insurance in today's overheated markets. In conclusion, Netflix is an amazing company with it's greatest flaw at this point in time being the market-capitalization.
