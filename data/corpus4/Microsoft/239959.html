Apple: Foxconn Results Indicate Strong iPhone Growth This Quarter - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple iPhone supplier Foxconn reported strong revenue and income growth for the September quarter. This has been attributed to the iPhone, although Foxconn provides no specific data on its customers. Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPhone supplier Foxconn's (AKA Hon Hai Precision) Q3 financial results and monthly revenue reports indicate that iPhone sales are growing substantially y/y by about 7%. This substantial growth rate belies Apple's own guidance for the quarter and underscores the "surprise" factor awaiting investors when Apple reports its fiscal Q1 results in January. Foxconn reported results on Monday with y/y revenue growth of 12% to $33.03 billion and y/y operating income growth of 21.6% to $1.18 billion. Foxconn is known to be Apple's principal supplier of iPhones, and this prompted an article titled, New iPhones lift Foxconn earnings in the Wall Street Journal (also at the link at MarketWatch), that pointed to iPhone as the reason for Foxconn's earnings growth. It was the kind of feel good article I would normally expect to find on one of the many Apple fan sites. Exactly how much of the revenue boost was attributable to the iPhone? The article doesn't say. How many iPhones has Foxconn produced? The article doesn't say. The lack of information is understandable, as Foxconn is very tight lipped about its customers. Foxconn's Q3 earnings report is about as minimalist as it gets. Foxconn doesn't bother holding quarterly earnings conference calls. What got me interested in Foxconn is that it reports its revenue on a monthly basis, and has already reported its revenue for October. I thought this could provide some advance insight into Apple's iPhone sales if I could determine the relationship between Foxconn's revenue and iPhones being ordered by Apple. Unfortunately, the relationship is not one-to-one. Foxconn is known to perform contract electronics assembly for many companies, including Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ). However, it turns out that Foxconn's revenue minus a fixed amount of $14 billion correlates fairly well with what I estimate to be Apple's payment to Foxconn for the iPhones produced. Apple's cost was estimated from the gross margin Apple reported for a given quarter and Apple's reported iPhone revenue for that quarter. The chart below shows the results. In effect, the Foxconn revenue matches fairly well with only the assumption that revenue from all other sources is fixed at $14 billion. Of course, this can't be perfectly true, since there's some random variance between the Foxconn revenue and the Apple estimated iPhone cost. The correlation gets stronger over time because the iPhone became a much larger percentage of Foxconn's total revenue as iPhone sales grew in 2013-2014. In the chart below, I show my estimate of iPhone sales as a percentage of total Foxconn revenue. Looking at Foxconn's monthly revenue report provides a way to zoom in on Foxconn sales, as well as get a sneak peek at the current quarter. In the chart below, I plot monthly revenue in $US for 2014 and 2015: As you can see, Foxconn's revenue takes off as Apple launches a new iPhone in September. Foxconn already beat last year's revenue (associated significantly with the iPhone 6/6 Plus) and is on a trajectory to surpass its December quarter 2014 revenue by about 7% to $49.76 billion. If my estimate of last year's iPhone revenue percentage for Q4 is applicable for this year (66%), then Foxconn's iPhone revenue will be about $32.8 billion. Applying Apple's typical gross margin of 40% results in $32.8/0.6 = $54.67 billion in iPhone revenue for Apple. This is a y/y increase of 6.8% compared to calendar 2014 Q4 iPhone revenue of $51.182 billion. Of course, there's a lot of uncertainty in the analysis. The precise amount of non-iPhone revenue clearly varies from quarter to quarter, and can't be predicted with certainty. My assumption of a fixed amount of $14 billion per quarter amounts to an approximation. However, in the past year, the first chart showed that this has been a conservative assumption as the percentage of iPhone revenue for Foxconn get larger. Also, investors will be able to watch Foxconn's revenue on a monthly basis throughout the quarter for additional insight as to the direction of iPhone sales. It's worth noting that UBS analyst Steve Milunovich has issued a prediction that closely agrees with the above result. Milunovich has predicted that Apple will sell 78.4 million iPhones in the December quarter, for a unit growth y/y of about 5%. Assuming the ASP of the September quarter of $670, this works out to iPhone revenue of $52.5 billion. As we proceed through the quarter, we're starting to see more positive reporting about the iPhone, such as Milunovich's prediction and the report from Canaccord Genuity that Apple's share of smartphone industry profit had grown to 94% as of calendar Q3. I expect we'll see more such reports as analysts converge on the approximately correct iPhone sales figure in the December quarter. I expect the 7% y/y iPhone revenue gain to be fairly close in the end. Combined with healthy sales of the iPad Pro and the Apple Watch, I fully expect Apple to blow past the top end of its guidance, y/y revenue growth of 4%.
