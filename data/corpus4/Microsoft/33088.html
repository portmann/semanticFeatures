My Dividend Portfolio: Accumulating Microsoft - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft offers an attractive opportunity for dividend accumulation, current consumer division issues notwithstanding. The company provides a dividend yield of 2.9%, with good prospects for continued dividend growth. I am developing a passive income stream from dividends to generate financial independence. I'm proceeding down the path of steadily accumulating a set of high-quality, dividend-paying stocks. My strategy is quarterly accumulation of 30 stocks through a low-cost brokerage , with a few thousand dollars invested across all these stocks at a time. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) is one of the businesses in my dividend portfolio that I will be accumulating. Microsoft is a giant of the technology industry. The owner of the dominant Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office franchises, Microsoft is a $353B company with more than $93B in annual revenue and 66% gross margins, with net income of close to $21B. The company currently trades at a forward P/E of 15, with a dividend yield of close to 2.9%. In brief, I am primarily looking for companies that have dominant moats and strong returns on equity, greater than 15%. I'm also looking for a track record of dividend increases and an average dividend yield of 2%. A full explanation for my filtering criterion for my portfolio can be found here . Microsoft's Windows and Office franchises form the core of the company's wide moat, in my view, with the rapidly growing server and tools businesses providing entrenched products with high switching costs. Microsoft has been able to generate healthy returns on equity, having earned a return on equity of well over 20% in recent years, in excess of my minimum requirement for inclusion in my dividend portfolio. The dividend yield also exceeded my threshold for inclusion. The company thus generally met my criteria for inclusion with my Dividend Accumulation Portfolio. Solid performer with a good operating history Microsoft has been in business since 1975. For such a large cap business, operating performance has actually been surprisingly good. The company has more than doubled revenues since 2005, increasing revenues from $39.8B in 2005 to close to $86 B in 2014, representing annualized growth of almost 9%. Operating income and EPS growth have shown strong performance, increasing by 12% and 13% annually over the same period. Total return performance over the last 10 years has been acceptable. An investor who invested $10,000 in the S&P 500 10 years ago would have returned close to $22,000. A similar investment in MSFT would have returned an investor just under $20,000. Enterprise strength augurs well for the company Microsoft continues to remain dominant in the enterprise segment, with close to 60% of revenues coming from commercial sales and licensing. Sales of Windows and Office to enterprise continue to increase (albeit slowly for Office). Encouragingly, Microsoft Server sales (including Windows and SQL Server) continue to post growth rates in excess of 10% annually, evidence of the company's strong embedded moat in enterprise infrastructure. The server part of the business accounts for close to 20% of Microsoft revenues. My continued belief here as far as looking to accumulate Microsoft is that sales to the enterprise will continue to help power the overall business. While consumers may continue to tinker with new devices and platforms, IT departments won't be as liberal when it comes to experimenting on enterprise-grade software. Consumer Dominance Eroding in the Post-PC Era The gradual movement of consumers away from PCs to mobile devices and tablets poses challenges and opportunities for Microsoft, which the company is still grappling with presently. Devices and consumer licensing revenue has been on a gradual decline since 2012. Microsoft Office is predominately deployed on PCs and laptops, both of which are coming under sustained pressure from high-performance mobile devices. IDC estimates that PC sales likely fell close to 7% in Q1 of 2015, with U.S. sales following approximately 1%. There are not many compelling reasons to upgrade PCs, and with tablets increasingly becoming computing devices of choice for consumers, it's unlikely that there is a catalyst to reverse this decline in the next few years. Smartphone and tablets are the computing devices that are experiencing rapid growth at the expense of the PC market. Microsoft still figures quite some way down compared to Google and Apple as the operating platform powering smartphone devices. According to comScore, the company had only a 3.5% share of smartphone devices as of September 2014. The lack of compelling traction of Microsoft in the consumer business remains a problem for the company, but also one in which it can arguably only improve from at this point Platform neutrality should be an advantage The new Microsoft management philosophy has been one of making Microsoft products and services available across non-Windows based platforms. In my opinion, this is also going to be critical to enable Microsoft to successfully compete in an era of mobile connected devices. In particular, I think this strategy helps Microsoft in the enterprise, where "bring your own device" is becoming an increasingly prevalent theme in the workplace. There is an increasing trend of users to bring their own devices into the workplace and have IT make them work. The iPad kicked off this trend, and it's only been accelerating since. By previously having Microsoft software and services tied up with Windows, if the company lost the operating system and hardware vote through users electing an alternate platform, that would also mean that supporting cloud and other service never had a chance to be purchased on that device. With the decision now being made to support other platforms and operating systems other than Windows, it still allows for IT departments to still influence deployment of supporting collaboration and cloud services on a specific device, even where a user opts to go the non-Microsoft route. I think this will help continue MSFT's lock on enterprise customers, and potentially open up consumers to use selective services. I was very attracted by MSFT's sizeable yield. I have several low-yielding stocks in my portfolio, such as Disney (NYSE: DIS ) and Visa (NYSE: V ), which I eventually expect to be moderate-yielding long-term dividend growth stocks. As these companies mature and have fewer growth opportunities to pursue, I expect them to pay out more cash in the form of dividends to shareholders. As such, I need a few higher-yielding stocks to help increase the effective yield on my portfolio, which now runs at 2.2%. MSFT helps me boost my current dividend income, whilst placing some bets on the dividend stars of tomorrow. Microsoft's solid dividend growth over the last decade also means the company keeps its place as a good dividend payer in my mind. The company managed to grow its dividend every single year over the last 10 years, with no dividend cuts, and tripling its dividend in the process. While Microsoft's consumer strength may appear to be in a state of flux, the company's enterprise strength gives me long-term comfort that the business will be a trusted enterprise partner for years to come. A deployment and upgrade cycle that IT departments understand and are familiar with, combined with high switching costs for deployed server infrastructure helps create a wide moat in the enterprise that won't be undone by the latest fad or hype cycle. Ordinarily, I'm a little cautious in looking to accumulate a long-term position in a technology company, just given the rapid rate of change that tends to impact players in the space and how rapidly innovation can disrupt incumbent positions. Microsoft's track record also gives me sense of belief that the company will continue to be around for many years to come. It has successfully navigated a variety of different business, economic and technology cycles. That gives me the confidence that the company will be able to navigate the trends that are currently taking place in cloud computing and mobile devices. Microsoft will be a position that I accumulate long term Microsoft appears to me to be fairly priced. While its Price-to-Earnings ratio is higher than its 5-year average, the company's dividend yield, Price-to-Book and Price/Sales all compare favorably with its 5-year averages, I feel comfortable that the company offers reasonable value to begin accumulating here, so I am happy to start accumulating the stock at these levels. I most recently purchased a holding at $41/share earlier in the year. This followed a previous purchase at $47 a share. I will continue to add MSFT quarterly, and consistently over a long-term horizon. Source: My Dividend Portfolio: Accumulating Microsoft Disclosure: The author is long MSFT.
