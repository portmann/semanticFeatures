Apple's Insurmountable Lead Over Commodity ARM Processors - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple has amassed an insurmountable performance lead in smartphone processors. Even flagship smartphones from Google have to settle for processors that are a year behind Apple. Watching Google's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Nexus phone event today brought home to me how non-competitive the commodity smartphone market has become compared to Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPhones. Google unveils a supposedly flagship phone, the Nexus 6p, but it's saddled with a Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) Snapdragon 810, which isn't even competitive with last year's iPhone 6 system on chip, the A8. In effect, the entire commodity smartphone market has fallen a year behind Apple. We've been hearing a lot about the Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 since it's going into so many supposedly premium smartphones, such as the Xiaomi Mi Note Pro and now the Google Nexus 6p made by Huawei. This is the 2.1 version which apparently has fixed the overheating problems that are thought by some to have caused Samsung to reject it for the Galaxy S6. The Snap 810 is the 64 bit SOC Qualcomm should have had a year ago when they needed an answer to the iPhone 6's second generation 64 bit SOC, the A8. The fact that it's now going into so many phones just shows how disadvantaged the commodity smartphone makers are becoming by being dependent on commodity processors. Samsung has the most competitive (with Apple) SOC around, the Exynos 7420 that goes into the Galaxy S6, but they're not sharing. The fact that the Snap 810 is the next best available option just shows how broken the commodity model has become. The performance difference between Apple's current generation A9 SOC and the Snap 810 has become so profound that I don't think anyone can reasonably argue that Apple will not have a significant market advantage as a result. Anandtech has recently been benchmarking the iPhone 6s , and here's just one of the benchmarks, using a Google supplied browser benchmark. Notice that Anandtech threw in the Microsoft Surface Pro 3 (with an Intel Core i5 processor) even though it wasn't really appropriate for a smartphone comparison. I can only assume that they did it just to have some device that was faster than the iPhone 6s. Also note that the A9 in the iPhone is more than twice as fast as the 810 in the Xiaomi Mi Note Pro. The 810 is the poster child for everything that's wrong with the commodity processor model. It was late to market to begin with, being introduced about a year after Apple shattered the industry with the world's first 64 bit ARM processor in a smartphone, the A7, that was introduced with the iPhone 5s in September 2013. Then it failed to win acceptance by Samsung for the S6 supposedly due to overheating problems. Actually, to some degree, Samsung rigged the competition with its own processor by virtue of being able to use its own 14 nm process. The 810 had to settle for TSMC's 20 nm process, the same that was used by Apple for the contemporaneous A8 in the iP6. But while Apple was able to engineer a highly competitive (with Samsung) processor in the A8 despite the process disadvantage, Qualcomm was not. This underscores the central advantage that Apple (and Samsung) have gained over the commodity processor makers such as Qualcomm. Apple has been able to leverage its huge profitability into a world class processor design capability. This design capability is on display in the benchmarks the A9 is racking up. Apple's processors are pulling away from the rest of the commodity pack. Only Samsung is keeping up, barely. Apple's profit advantage also was put to good competitive use in the funding of dual sources for the A9. As I pointed out recently , the A9 is being produced by both Samsung and TSMC. This has been noticed by Anandtech and confirmed by Chipworks, who noted that the processors are of slightly different size . The dual sourcing is another master stroke by Apple that is only made possible by the huge profits that Apple achieves. Anandtech's observations about this bear repeating: With dual sourcing essentially requiring the chip to be taped out twice - once for each fab - it requires significant financial and engineering resources, a cost that not very many companies besides Apple can take on without significant risk. In my discussion of the TSMC fabrication, I pointed to the fact that Apple is highly motivated to sever its dependence on Samsung, and I believe that this is why Apple went dual source. But dual sourcing also meant that Apple could be sure to meet the huge initial demand for the phones on opening weekend, 13 million in sales according to Apple . Dual sourcing underscores the competitive advantages that Apple has achieved in mobile processor design and fabrication. Only Samsung can, and probably is, matching Apple's investment. As such, the two companies are pulling away from the rest of the ARM commodity pack. Apple's iPhone sales are now so large that Apple has wiped out what has always been assumed to be the ultimate advantage of commodity processors: economies of scale. As a consequence, Apple's SOCs are no more expensive to develop and produce than any commodity SOC such as the 810. The fundamental lesson that the commodity semiconductor industry is still learning to its grief is that the custom SOC paradigm has no cost disadvantages (at Apple scale) while retaining numerous performance advantages. Those who point to the 810 for signs of hope for the commodity ARM processor business are missing the big picture tectonic shift that is underway in the consumer electronics industry. After seeing just how good the A9 is, I've become even more bullish on iPhone sales for the December quarter and continue to regard Apple as a strong buy. Apple's position at the premium end of the smartphone market is unassailable for the foreseeable future. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
