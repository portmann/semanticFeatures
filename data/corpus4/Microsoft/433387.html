What Is Apple Really Up To? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple refreshed its line of operating systems at its Worldwide Developer Conference. Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Worldwide Developer Conference drew yawns and brickbats from analysts, with the stock losing $1.50/share and failing, yet again, to sustain a move over $100. But hidden inside the refreshes were some important strategic moves. First, the Watch is not dead. Expect a "Watch 2" later this year that does not depend on the iPhone, with more storage and native processing capability, possibly including the power to take compute power from bands. What Apple found with the initial Watch was that integration with iPhone apps was too slow to be useful. Within a short time people were using the Watch as, well, a Watch. My guess is the new Watch OS will be more focused on health applications, using HealthKit, than on alerts based on phone interactions. Apps will open instantly, users will be able to scribble on the Watch face to write messages, and they will be able to switch quickly between the apps they actually use. It may take the "traditional" three versions to get this right, but Apple isn't giving up. Second, Siri is being handed over to developers through a SiriKit, a software development kit designed to embed Siri into apps people already use. It's an attempt to get the voice system into the app mainstream, the kind of opening you get in a competitive market after products fail in their initial proprietary mode. Third, the set-top box space is going to get a lot more interesting. Apple TV is getting a single sign-on that allows access to all video services offered by an ISP. As the Internet continues to take over TV, with a single Internet subscription replacing the hundreds of channels which have nothing on, there's about $100/month in "savings" that can now go into buying content. Apple is willing to open up to get its cut. Fourth, Apple is, like many other companies now, starting to feel competition from Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ). Its overhaul of iMessage is based entirely on the idea it has to deliver the feature Messenger, WhatsApp and Snapchat have had for months. Fifth, Apple is taking Apple Pay to more platforms, including the MacOS . This gets Apple Pay into the computing mainstream, where 70% of online commerce is still conducted, while still taking advantage of explosive mobile system growth, where it has a 65% market share. Right now the company is focused on being part of traditional card and credit systems run by Visa (NYSE: V ) and MasterCard (NYSE: MA ), but if it becomes its own processor or (even better) its own credit card bank, watch out. Apple now has four operating systems - MacOS (formerly OS X), iOS (for the phone), TVOS (for Apple TV) and WatchOS (for the Watch). It is becoming as dependent upon developers as Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) was back when Steve Ballmer was dancing across the stage. The big event on the Apple calendar is yet to arrive. That is its next product refresh, which will happen whenever Apple decides it is ready to announce. That's when the new Watch, the new TV, the new iPhone, and hopefully "one more thing" will set tongues wagging again. Until then, you have a cheap stock, with a Price/Earnings multiple under 11, and a 2.34 yield to keep you warm. The yield will keep the shares from falling much, but don't expect anything big to happen to the shares until the fall. Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL, MSFT.
