Apple: Does Intel Inside iPhone Make Any Sense? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. VentureBeat has reported that Apple is considering Intel for a modem and possibly foundry services for the next iPhone. Selection of an Intel modem is unlikely, given that a superior modem from Qualcomm will be available. Use of Intel foundry services is also unlikely for a variety of reasons. Most importantly, tests of the iPhone 6s demonstrate that its processor is far superior to any x86 processor Intel could offer. Recently, VentureBeat reported that Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) has 1,000 people working on chips for the iPhone, which is a repackaged speculation VentureBeat had published back in March . While the reports may appeal to Intel's investors, it probably doesn't make sense in the context of the paradigm shift in semiconductor manufacturing that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) represents. I continue to find signs in technology articles and article comments of a certain nostalgia that semiconductor investors have for the commodity semiconductor paradigm. In this paradigm, companies such as Intel supplied chips for a host of OEMs, who duked it out with other OEMs. To the semiconductor supplier, it didn't matter which OEM became dominant. The semiconductor supplier was, in a sense, at the top of the food chain. Articles such as those that appeared in VentureBeat play on the longing for a return to those good ol' days. The fantasy scenario that is proffered is that once Intel has its foot in the door with a modem for the iPhone, then Apple would turn to Intel for foundry services for an SOC that integrates the Intel modem. Finally, there is the implication that eventually Apple will give up this silly notion that it can design its own SOCs and turn to Intel Architecture, since it's obviously superior. So, in the fantasy scenario, we come full circle to the commodity processor supplier/OEM device maker paradigm of the PC days. Then all will be right with the world. There are so many things wrong with this scenario that it's only by appealing to a very deep seated bias on the part of Intel investors that such articles can even find an audience. And clearly, the leaked information being reported in the VentureBeat articles has to be coming from the Intel side. Even this says a great deal about the substance of the rumors. If Intel had anything like a commitment from Apple, there would be no leaks. Intel is professional enough to respect Apple's product secrecy requirements, if there were any. No, this is Intel deliberately leaking information in the hopes it will get some buzz and contribute to a groundswell of interest that might sway Apple. I'm sure it's true as far as it goes. I'm sure there are many Intel engineers working on the 7360 LTE modem. I'm sure Apple has been invited to presentations where Intel pitches the modem. I'm sure there is some level of interchange between the two companies, where Apple engineers have communicated requirements for a future iPhone. In particular, I'm sure it's true that Apple has not committed to the Intel modem. Why should Apple commit to the Intel modem? It has better modem waiting in the wings in the form of the Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) X12 modem that Qualcomm will incorporate into the Snapdragon 820, and which will also be available as the MDM 9645. Apple currently uses the MDM9635M in the new iPhone 6s. By virtually every standard, the Qualcomm X12 modem will be superior to what Intel is promising for the 7360 . For instance, the X12 will feature a maximum download rate of 600 Mbit/sec versus the 7360 rate of 450 Mbit/sec. Qualcomm, by virtue of the prior experience of Apple engineers with Qualcomm modems, enjoys a tremendous incumbency advantage over Intel. Given that Qualcomm will offer better performance than Intel, I don't see why Apple would be motivated to switch. One scenario has it that Apple will choose the Intel modem on the basis of its assumed lower cost for an iPhone targeted at emerging markets. When has Apple shown any willingness to lower the quality of its phones to move down market? What of the supposed link to Infineon (where the modem technology of Intel came from) that exists inside of Apple? When Intel bought the German company, Apple took the opportunity, as the VentureBeat article points out, to scoop up numerous Infineon executives and engineers who were jumping ship rather than work for Intel. Clearly, they have no particular allegiance or love for Intel. The hiring of the Infineon personnel is an important clue to Apple's long-term objectives. Apple, as the SOC integrator for its mobile devices, needs to be able to include modems into the SOC. This is clearly where the industry (led by Qualcomm) is moving. This will reduce the overall chipset cost inside Apple devices, as well as give it better control over the modem in terms of power management. Until that objective is achieved, the Infineon personnel can certainly serve as liaison with Intel, but I'm sure they do with Qualcomm as well. The VentureBeat article also supports Apple wanting to move the modem onto the SOC. However, the article assumes that this would be a modem design licensed from Intel, and that Intel would get foundry business from Apple by fabricating the resultant SOC. The key problem with this scenario is that Intel executives have already made it clear on numerous occasions that Intel's foundry services are not open to processors that would directly compete with Intel Architecture chips. Since Intel is currently competing in both smartphones and tablets, Apple's SOCs would certainly qualify for the ban. I believe that this is the best explanation for why Apple isn't already using Intel as a foundry, but it's not the only one. Suppose Intel relaxed the ban. There's still the problem of Intel as a competitor who has waged a campaign of predatory pricing (in the form of the contra revenue scheme) of its tablet (and possibly phone) processors to gain market share. That has to lead to some bad blood between the companies, given that declining sales of iPad that have coincided with contra revenue since the beginning of 2014. Even if Apple overlooks this, Apple has already been there and done that with using a competitor's foundry service. As I have pointed out , Apple is motivated to transition away from Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) partly because it can't really be certain that its trade secrets will not be leaked from the foundry service to Samsung's mobile device business. This would certainly be a consideration for any foundry arrangement with Intel. Given Apple's need for security, Apple relying on TSMC (NYSE: TSM ) as a foundry partner makes more sense. Apple doesn't have to worry about TSMC trying to get into the device business. TSMC's process may not be the equal of Intel's, but it makes more sense for Apple to fund TSMC's move to 10 nm from the current 16 nm process as rapidly as possible. Given Intel's slowdown of introduction of 10 nm to late 2017, Apple has a good chance of getting to 10 nm faster with TSMC, which has stated that it will start 10 nm production in 2017. Another possible interpretation of the foundry issue is that Apple adopts Intel Architecture CPU cores in its SOCs. I still encounter articles and comments that assume that Intel Architecture would be superior, but in fact, with the A9 processor in the new iPhone 6s, Intel is only falling further behind. This point was made clear to me by the excellent and very comprehensive review of the iPhone 6s that just came out in Anandtech . The review confirms my long-held belief that iPhone 6s is the world's fastest smartphone . Intel's Atom X3 (SoFIA) smartphone SOC is so far behind the A9 that it's not even worth the trouble to compare the two. And it might not even be fair, since the X3 is still fabricated on a 28 nm process (for cost reasons). So let's do a comparison that makes more sense in terms of indicating future Intel smartphone capability. Let's compare the A9 to the Intel Atom X7, which is actually a tablet processor, but it probably shows where Intel could be in smartphone SOCs in about a year or two. The X7 is fabricated on Intel's best 14 nm process, so it's not disadvantaged the way the X3 is. In the table below, I compare test results administered by Anandtech for the Microsoft Surface 3 (running Win 8.1 64 bit) and the iPhone 6s of the just completed review. The test results were given in two separate articles, and I've compiled only the benchmarks that were in common. Here, I've normalized the performance results to the iPhone 6s and included the iPhone 6 for comparison. In almost all the tests, the iPhone 6s is clearly superior. You could argue that to some degree, the poor performance is the fault of Windows, and I can't disprove this. Clearly, a processor comparison would be better done with identical operating systems. But even Anandtech's tests often compare iOS and Android devices, so cross OS comparisons are normal. My own experience says that Win 8 is not that bad. In fact it showed considerable performance improvement compared to Win 7. I personally doubt that it's the underlying cause of the performance shortfall. I think the results demonstrate that with the A9 processor, Apple has moved way ahead of Intel Architecture for low power devices. Apple makes performance improvements with each new generation A series SOC, so the A10 in the iPhone 7 will be even better. In all three of the categories I've discussed, Intel falls short. Intel doesn't offer the better modem, Qualcomm does. Intel doesn't offer the more desirable foundry service (all things considered), TSMC does. And Intel doesn't offer the better processor architecture, Apple does. I continually urge investors to be data-driven in their decision making. The VentureBeat article is not a data-driven approach, it's a prejudice-driven approach that simply assumes that Intel inside would be a good thing. At most, there's a possibility that Intel might get a modem into iPhone, but even this seems very dubious. As for foundry services, I think Apple is quite happy with TSMC. And as for Intel Architecture, despite claims to the contrary, it's just falling further behind. Despite the fond wish of Intel investors, there is no going back from the paradigm shift that is making old-style semiconductor companies like Intel obsolete.
