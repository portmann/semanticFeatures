Microsoft Is Copying Apple's Strategy, And It Will Work - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha With the introduction of the Surface Book, Microsoft has officially turned the corner. MSFT is not just a software company anymore, but a company that has taken control of the hardware engineering as well. And if you haven't noticed, that's what Apple has been doing all along. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) has really done it this time. MSFT's new Surface Book is not only a bold step in the right direction, but also its new strategy might prove to be a thunderstorm for the entire PC industry. To begin with, the Surface Book is really two products in one. It's a classic laptop, but it can also be turned into a tablet by detaching the screen. As for specs, the Surface Book has the latest Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) Core i5 and i7 processors from the Skylake family, an Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) GeForce GPU with GDDR5 memory, two USB 3.0 ports and an SD card slot. Microsoft claims the Surface Book can run for 12 hours in a single charge, something that is suppose to give Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) MacBook family of laptops a run for their money. In addition, Microsoft claims the Surface Book is twice as fast as the MacBook Pro. All this does not come cheap, with the base model starting at $1,499. MSFT is also breaking ground with smartphones. In a recent New York event, the company introduced the Lumia 950XL, the Lumia 950 and the new Lumia 550. No specs were given for the Lumia 550; however, the other two phones are impressive. Both include quad HD OLED, with the processors requiring liquid cooling. The 950 carries the Snapdragon 808 64-bit hexacore processor while the 950XL the Snapdragon 810 64-bit octacore processor. Both phones come with 32GB storage expandable to 2TB with a microSD card slot (that was not a typo), and both have a 20 megapixel Zeiss PureView rear camera and a 5-megapixel front-facing camera. The cameras also have optical image stabilization and can take pictures in 4K too. On top of that, the phones will include support for Windows Hello. In a nutshell, you'll be able to log into the phone with just your face, making use of the latest features in Windows 10 Mobile. However that's not all Microsoft is up to. Check out the Microsoft Band 2 . The Band is, first and foremost, a fitness device. It features many data-collecting health sensors, and it includes useful components like a GPS. Sure, Band also does email, calendar, text messages, phone calls and other useful things, but it is made primarily for the health and productivity geek in all of us. The scope of this article is not to present to you a review of the latest Microsoft products and gadgets. Instead, the scope is to make you realize that Microsoft is changing by leaps and bounds, and for the most part, it's coping Apple's strategy. And that strategy is none other than to take control of both the hardware and software when making stuff. That's right, Microsoft is turning into a hardware company. And it is taking control over the design and engineering of its products. Is Microsoft correct in doing so? Absolutely. I have never understood why AAPL could make devices and computers, but MSFT could not. I have been saying all along that Microsoft needs to take control over the hardware side of things, instead of relying on the good faith of OEMs, who for the most part do not have an innovative bone in their body. In fact, the reason why Apple stuff works so well is because AAPL has complete control over the hardware and software engineering. Thus, it is able to design things so they work great together and so ergonomically, that Macs need a lot less processing power to do the same work as many Windows machines. That's also the main reason behind Apple's ability to innovate and always be ahead of everyone else. It has no constraints when designing stuff. With the release of the Surface Book, Microsoft proved that it can innovate if it tries. I mean MSFT has so many smart people working for it, it is unrealistic to think that it cannot make as good, or a better laptop, phone or gadget, than Dell or Sony (NYSE: SNE ). And by taking complete control over the engineering, Microsoft can design and produce stuff that works well and does not crash, as Apple does. And I think that laptops, phones and gadgets are just the beginning for Microsoft. I do not see any reason why the company cannot produce desktop computers as well. Yes, that might put several OEMs in a difficult position, but so what? It's Microsoft's operating system and software engineering, it could do whatever it wants with it. Microsoft's changing business model might (should) put some pressure on Apple also. I mean if Microsoft continues to innovate with products like the Surface Book, then Apple will feel the pressure. I do not think that people who use MacBooks or other Apple products will abandon Apple overnight; however, if MSFT continues churning out great products that work well and have something different to say, then over the long term, AAPL will feel the pressure. Is this positive for Microsoft's stock? Of course it is. Think of it this way. Microsoft until now (meaning several years ago) has been a pure software company. The revenue and earnings from this software is not going away. It is still there and will continue to be so. But hardware sales were never there. If Microsoft gets serious about the hardware side of things, then shareholders will be getting a free bonus. Meaning, the hardware revenue and the earnings that come with it, with no additional effort. In fact, the only additional thing MSFT has to do is the engineering. Manufacturing (most of it anyway) will always be outsourced. Putting Microsoft's name on computers and gadgets does not require any additional effort or money. As such, we now have to look at Microsoft from another angle. And that angle (similar to Apple) is a company that designs and manufactures everything from top to bottom in-house. I mean just look at Apple. Apple within several years has become the most valuable company in the world. May I also add that Apple's PC market share is still rising, even as PC sales across the board are declining? Yes, Apple has had many home runs with the iPhone and several other products; however, it would have never gotten where it has if it was a pure software company. I have always disagreed that Microsoft should only make software. I have always insisted that it should make hardware also. Who says there are no profits in hardware? There are if you make good stuff that people are willing to pay for. If you make ordinary middle-of-the-road stuff, then people will not be willing to pay through the nose for it. Further evidence that Microsoft's business model is changing is the it is now giving away Windows 10 for free. Just like Apple, I think Microsoft should simply charge for great hardware and give the OS for free. I like Microsoft's recent products, and I like the fact that at last it is taking over the engineering behind the hardware, and putting its own label on laptops and other stuff. I think MSFT's shareholders will benefit greatly over the years ahead, the same way Apple's shareholders have benefited. Of course that assumes Microsoft is innovative enough to make things people want to buy. But judging from the Surface Book, I think Microsoft will do just fine in this regard.
