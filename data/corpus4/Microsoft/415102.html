Report: Microsoft prepping cheaper Xbox One for 2016, VR-capable model for 2017 (updated) - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha May 25 2016, 14:10 ET | About: Microsoft C... (MSFT) | By: Eric Jhonsa, SA Eye on Tech , SA News Editor Gaming site Kotaku reports Microsoft ( MSFT +1.5%) plans to launch "a cheaper, smaller, Xbox One" this year, and will launch a more powerful model in 2017. The cheaper/smaller Xbox is expected to be shown off at the industry's E3 conference (runs from June 14-16). The 2017 console, codenamed Scorpio, will have a more powerful GPU, and be capable of handling 4K gaming and directly supporting Facebook's (NASDAQ: FB ) Oculus Rift VR headset. Microsoft already has a partnership with Oculus through which streamed Xbox One games can be played on Rift headsets connected to Windows 10 PCs. Also reported: 1) Microsoft wants to further its efforts to converge Xbox and Windows, with future hit games released on both platforms. 2) Microsoft is moving towards an "incremental" upgrade model for consoles (much as it's doing for Windows), with frequent hardware upgrades replacing massive upgrades that arrive every several years. Sony has been widely reported to be prepping a revamped PlayStation 4 that supports 4K gaming and "enhanced" support for the company's PlayStation VR headset. Both the new console and the PlayStation VR are expected later this year. AMD ( AMD +0.2%) supplies an APU (integrated CPU/GPU) for both the PS4 and Xbox One, and will presumably get an ASP boost from the sale of more powerful APUs for 4K-capable consoles. Update: Also of interest: The Verge reports Microsoft plans to unveil a "Chromecast-like" streaming stick for Xbox digital content at E3. The device will work with Xbox One controllers. Nintendo: waiting forever until the trend ends. More foolish not to develop mobile games for iOS and Android.  They should (already have) gone the way of Sega and stick with software.  I'm long NTDOY but it's been a painful wait as a shareholder.
