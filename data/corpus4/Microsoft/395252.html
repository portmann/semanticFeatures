Apple's Software Culture Is Hurting Its Future - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha In a recent article, I discussed Apple's future as a device company. Many readers disagreed with my characterization and pointed to Apple's service ecosystem. After AAPL's disastrous earnings, I feel compelled to look closer at Apple's service business. I also want to take this opportunity to talk about software culture and why I don't believe in Apple's acquisition strategy in this segment. This article is a follow-up to my recent long-term outlook on Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) as a device company. Needless to say, I got a lot of negative feedback on that piece. Commenters claimed I was wrong about peak iPhone, I underestimated Apple's growing service segment and that the company's history of successful execution was a sure sign of future success. While some commenters appreciated the long-term perspective, the majority claimed it was flat out ridiculous to envision a world in which Apple could not defend its premium ecosystem. I want to use this article to comment on Apple's service and cloud strategy and in particular at its software culture and acquisition strategy. First, hindsight sure is 20/20. Not only did Apple miss, but also it guided sales downward significantly for the remaining year. Major players like Carl Icahn are liquidating their positions. Further, the global smartphone market shrank for the first time ever. Apple is selling less of a declining pie, and there is no indication of how the next iPhone should change this. However, I do not expect this to convince anyone to change their opinion. It is well known that confirmation bias makes us stick to a belief even if presented with contradicting evidence. Commenters also said I was ignoring Apple's growing service revenues. Let's take a look at Q1 results and guidance for Q2: Service revenues were essentially flat. What I feel many commenters do not appreciate is that Apple's service revenues are largely correlated revenues. This is a direct consequence of Apple's closed ecosystem and its services (Apple Care, Licensing, Apple Pay, iTunes) being tightly coupled to its devices. Less devices mean less service revenue. Of course, if you believe Apple will soon sell more (new) devices again, this argument is meaningless to you as well. Hence, instead of further discussing who is right about the future of Apple as a device company, I want to comment on what I believe to be a management issue at AAPL that needs to be remedied to transform it into a less device-dependent company. Apple has a drastically different software culture than other major tech companies. Apple is incredibly secretive and takes its time, things right to create amazing user experiences. This is in stark contrast to Facebook's (NASDAQ: FB ) "move fast and break things" mantra. If you are interested in an insider's voice, an Apple software engineer has written an interesting report . The key paragraph for me is this: Unsurprisingly given the situation described above, an employee's ability to have an impact at Apple rarely exceeds the bounds of their daily work and team. There are small triumphs. I once managed to get more contrast in iOS by filing the original bug requesting to change the yellow color in the Notes app to something darker with more contrast. However, at the end of the day other teams find it more time efficient to say no, than really consider your point of view. Apple's culture makes a lot of sense for hardware. Hardware development cycles are much longer, and it takes an incredible amount of precision and focus to release a product that just has the right look and feel. Once a product is done, you cannot easily change it. Jony Ive provides the product design vision for it has served Apple well. From the outside, it looks like Apple is missing the same vision for software. I have multiple data points that lead me towards thinking this. The report comes to the following conclusion: As Tim Cook often says on stage, he can't wait to see what developers will come up with next. As a result, I realized that there was a lot more opportunity to push the boundaries of the iOS platform as a third party developer. What might be hard for people outside of the tech scene to appreciate is that Apple is not a top-tier employer in software (except for iOS development maybe) for exactly the reasons named in this report. Apple does not pay worse than Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ). This is about the fact that Apple's software culture makes it in some way unattractive as an employer. Let me break this down for you. Thought leaders in software architecture, cloud computing/distributed systems and machine learning who do not wish to stay in academia and who are not founding their own startups have the following choices: Established top-tier software companies (Google, Facebook, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) or late-stage private companies like Dropbox or Palantir). Large, lots of perks, lots of teams with many interesting tasks. Flexibility to move between teams and projects. Possibility to gain visibility through high-profile projects within the company. Pays decently well, generous stock grants. Early-stage companies or growth-stage startups like Snapchat (Private: CHAT ), Uber (Private: UBER ) or Slack (Private: SLACK ). More volatility, less corporate overhead, stock grants may turn out to be worth millions or worthless, but more immediate responsibility and opportunity to move up in the growth stage. Finance: Quantitative hedge funds, prop trading firms/HFT. Very high risk-adjusted return, higher than tech, less "cool geeky" stuff and a more stressful work environment. While Apple is a top-tier employer in general and a great destination for designers or, say, electrical engineers, it is not a top-tier software employer because it lacks exactly either the high payout from finance or startups or the flexibility/perks and opportunities of Google or Facebook. As the report goes on to say, internal moves are not possible without going through the same application process as an external candidate. This is of course not to say that Apple's software engineers are not highly skilled developers and architects. It just means, on average, that Apple is unlikely to be the first choice of employer in this segment. For instance, my peers are mostly heading to Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Palantir if they are not doing a startup. This distinction might seem irrelevant to some of you, but it leads me to my key point. Building innovative software services and cloud platforms is hard. Software is not some commodity component that just gets better if you throw more developers at it ( HealthCare.gov, anyone ?). Software is a scene that has thought leaders and innovators that developers want to work for, and this is true for both the long-term vision level as well as the concrete implementation level. For illustration, a lot of Google's global search and indexing infrastructure was devised by a few key employees (e.g. Jeff Dean, Sanjay Ghemawat, Urs Hoelzle). On the executive level, Microsoft is turning into a mobile/cloud company driven by the vision of Satya Nadella. He made Microsoft a "cool" place to work for again: Tim Cook says he cannot wait what developers will do next. This is the wrong attitude. Just releasing frameworks hoping others will make apps that generate revenue for Apple is not enough, especially at times where most attention is devoted to a few core apps (Facebook, WhatsApp, Snapchat, Mail) and there is an increasing threshold for users to accept new apps. A "let them build it and they will pay us" attitude will not yield a lead for Apple. I think Tim Cook does not understand software culture. This is fine for the CEO of a company that makes almost all of its profits from premium devices and I do believe him to be a great overall manager. Tim Cook makes hires like Angela Ahrendts and relies on Jony Ive's product design vision. What the executive team is clearly missing is someone who can lead the way into a less device-centric world. Craig Federighi, Apple's SVP of software engineering, oversees OSX/iOS and he has done a great job there. However, operating systems design is completely different from devising new cloud services that integrate into Apple's existing product suite. Siri was an acquisition and the founders left Apple years ago. Since then, Apple has not done much in expanding Siri-like services in the way other tech companies are moving into natural language processing (Facebook's intelligent messenger, Microsoft's bot platform, Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Echo). Apple is simply not present enough in this space even though it would make a lot of sense to expand there. Instead, we hear news about internal quarrels in Apple's cloud division. I view this as an example of Tim Cook's "supply chain" mentality towards software. Just acquiring small startups here and there to integrate their products will not be enough if the startup culture clashes with Apple's software culture. As of right now, most of Apple's software services are relatively mundane stuff. Storage, Apple Care, Music, iTunes. Compare that to Microsoft's vision of natural language interaction through bots or IBM's Watson. Pay is a move in the right direction, but not expected to generate meaningful revenue in the short term. Apple should make larger, more daring acquisitions here, e.g. Slack. Ideally, they should be device-independent, i.e. web-based services that can be used both from Apple devices, integrating into the ecosystem, as well as from non-device owners. No matter where you stand on Apple's device sales, I believe AAPL needs a change in software culture. It needs to be able to grow revenues independent from devices. It needs to attract visionaries in cloud computing, SaaS and machine learning. Tim Cook needs to hire a thought leader similar to Google's move of hiring Diane Greene to turn around its cloud business. Satya Nadella is a great example of how a slowing company turned around its image this way.
