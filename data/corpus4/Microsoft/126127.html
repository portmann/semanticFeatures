The Hidden Strengths Of Skyworks Solutions - Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) | Seeking Alpha Skyworks Solutions is the best-in-class analog semiconductor company. Apple may need Skyworks Solutions more than Skyworks Solutions needs Apple. On 07/21/2105 after the market closed, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) reported revenue of $49.6 billion vs. estimates of $46.3 billion and earnings of $1.85 per share vs. estimates of $1.81 per share. Apple also provided a Q4 forecast showing revenue ranging from $49 billion to $51 billion vs. estimates of $51.1 billion. In spite of beating expectations and providing a forecast essentially in line with estimates, Apple's results as well as Q4 forecasts disappointed the market. This disappointment was evidenced in the after-market selloff of Apple's shares by more than 7% as well as the selloff of Apple's suppliers' shares, most notably that of Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ: SWKS ). I believe the selloff of Apple is overblown and even more so for SWKS. The concern, the bear case, voiced by a few, was that Apple is showing signs of slowing down because sales for iPhones were estimated at 50 million for Q3 where actual sales were 47.5 million. Phone sales for Apple grew by better than 35% year-over-year (y/y) globally and better than 100% in China on a y/y basis. The bears also claim that the price of the iPhone is too expensive and yet Apple grew sales volume of the iPhone while increasing the price by more than $100.00 per phone. Apple has approximately 20% of the smartphone market but captures better than 92% of the profit in the smartphone market according to the Wall Street Journal and other publications. The simple truth is Apple's products are luxury items that provide utility and it is human nature to want luxury. If it is within their reach, people will buy the relatively more luxurious item. That is the Apple phenomenon. As per the second bullet point, Apple may need Skyworks Solutions more than Skyworks Solutions needs Apple. Clearly Apple is as valuable a customer as a company can be. The point here is that Skyworks Solutions technology enhances Apple's products and therefore the Apple customer experience. Skyworks Solutions is an analog semiconductor company. Its technology supports broadband, wireless connectivity, GPS, automotive, energy management, military, medical devices, etc. Essentially, SWKS is an integral part of the "Internet of Things." As I stated in the third paragraph, the selloff of SWKS was even more overblown than the selloff of Apple. The greatest strength of SWKS is its customer base. As per the Q4 2014 10K report , SWKS customers, to name a few, are as follows: Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) (the largest smartphone provider globally) Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO ), Dell, Ericsson (NASDAQ: ERIC ), Huawaei (the fourth largest provider of smartphones globally), General Electric (NYSE: GE ), Foxconn (Apple direct supplier), Northrup Grumman (NYSE: NOC ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), Lenovo ( OTCPK:LNVGY ) and LG Electronics. Let's entertain the bear case and say that Apple for the next two or more quarters will not grow iPhone sales at a higher rate than those of say Samsung and Huawaei. That for the next three quarters, Samsung and Huawaei report a 40% annualized increase in their respective smartphone sales while Apple is only able to grow at 35%. Will Apple's inability to grow at the same or higher rate erode SWKS revenue growth? It absolutely will not. This should be as simple as it gets for an analyst, trader or investor, but based on the selloff, analysts et al, have not considered SWKS' strengths. If Apple's competitors are taking market share from Apple, that shift also benefits SWKS because Apple's competitors are SWKS customers. Some of the analysts say that the Chinese economy is in a recession and that Apple's future growth prospects in China will shrink as evidenced by the recent correction of the Chinese stock market. This position is nonsensical. Not only did Apple report a 100% y/y increase in revenue from China, Huawaei also reported better than a 35% increase in y/y sales. Again, both scenarios benefit SWKS. Furthermore, SWKS is not solely or mainly dependent upon Apple. SWKS has made significant gains in medical devices, automotive, military and energy maintenance industries to name a few. SWKS revenues are growing y/y by more than 58% and net income by more than 116% as per Q2 2015 results . On 07/23/2015, SWKS will report its Q3 2015 results after the market closes. Estimates are that SWKS will report revenue of $801.5 million and $1.29 earnings per share (EPS). I believe SWKS will beat these estimates showing revenue ranging from $810 - $815 million and EPS ranging from $1.35 to $1.45. Furthermore, I believe management will reiterate, if not raise, guidance for Q4 2015. The selloff was ridiculously overblown and in all probability evidences a lack of understanding of SWKS markets and products. If Apple gives up market share to a competitor, that also benefits SWKS. My message to investors is simply this - don't throw the baby out with the bath water. Read the company's 2014 10K report, and you will see and understand that SWKS is probably the best positioned company in its space and will benefit from virtually any move, up or down, in its space. I rate SWKS a strong buy. Source: The Hidden Strengths Of Skyworks Solutions Disclosure: I am/we are long SWKS AND AAPL. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
