Microsoft Heads To Hollywood - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft has announced the official release date for it's Minecraft-based movie. Movie adaptations of video games have recently become successful, such as the Warcraft and Angry Birds films. In 2014, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) opened its purse and cut a $2.5 billion check to acquire Mojang, the maker of Minecraft. Minecraft has resonated exceptionally well with consumers, and has sold over 100 million copies in its lifetime. The next step for the franchise is to head to Hollywood. Mojang announced that it has an official date for the release of its Minecraft-based movie: May 24, 2019. Mojang is teaming up with Warner Bros, and plans to make its film available in 3D and IMAX. The movie will be directed by Rob McElhenney, who is best known for his work in "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia." From the research I've conducted, it appears the movie will have a feeling akin to that of the Lego movie. This is all basic information about the film, so let's move into its financial impact. This is an interesting time for movie adaptations of video games. This segment of films had performed horribly in the past. However, the box office numbers of Angry Birds and Warcraft (based on Activision Blizzard's (NASDAQ: ATVI ) World of Warcraft) demonstrate that these kinds of results could be a thing of the past. Angry Birds' $73 million budget was justified by a $336.8 million haul at the box office. Warcraft racked up $422.1 million at the box office so far in an attempt to offset a $160 million production budget. The general rule of thumb states that a movie needs to earn 2.5x its budget at the box office in order to turn a profit. By this measure, both of these films have already crossed the threshold of profitability. Their success would not be possible without the contribution of China at the box office. Out of ticket revenue, Angry Birds derived 22% of its revenues from China, while Warcraft pulled a whopping 55% from the Middle Kingdom. Movie adaptations of video games work by capitalizing on the popularity of the existing game. By looking at the Angry Birds and World of Warcraft's subscription numbers compared to their respective box office revenues, we can get a crude sense of how the Minecraft movie will perform. Angry Birds has 30 million daily players in its app. By netting $336.8 million at the box office, this represents an 11.23 user-to-revenue multiple. If we multiply this number with the number of Minecraft players, we could see a rough box office estimate based off of the Angry Birds movie performance. Minecraft has sold 106 million copies, but this includes desktop, Xbox, and app purchases. Since many of these are overlapping, let's assume that 40% of these purchases are made by unique individuals. This gives us an estimate 42.4 million unique players in the Minecraft network. Using this figure, we would conservatively reach a box office estimate of $476.2 million with the Angry Birds model. Using this same process with Warcraft's numbers, box office numbers would reach $890.4 million. These two figures should serve as a high and low reference point for the Minecraft movie. However, I am fairly confident that it will be closer to the $890.4 million total. The film won't be released until 2019, which gives it ample time to expand its user/fan base. The Minecraft movie can also learn from the extremely successful marketing tactics used with the Warcraft movie in China. Lastly, Minecraft's box office numbers were held back by exceptionally poor reviews on Rotten Tomatoes. The Minecraft film is a "large budget" project, so I expect production costs to be in the range of $125 to $175 million. If this is the case and the rule of thumb is applied, the Minecraft movie will be profitable in both of the calculated scenarios. This is before merchandising and further game purchases are taken into account. All in all, I see the Minecraft film venture as a large generator of cash for Microsoft. It's still a far ways out, but I think a reasonable estimate of $550-$800 million at the box office is not unreasonable and will bode very well for Microsoft. A success from the venture will help to diversify its revenue stream and open a channel of growth that Microsoft can capitalize on.
