Apple Earnings: Not A Blow-Out, But Good Enough - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple's exceptional revenue and earnings growth was greeted with market dismay after hours. On closer examination, Apple's results bode well for the difficult year-over-year comparisons in the coming quarters. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) reported stellar revenue growth of 33% y/y and EPS growth of 45%, yet the market was disappointed, and Apple shares dropped 7% after hours. I had high expectations for the quarter, which were not quite met, but the market's reaction represents a buying opportunity. Occasionally, the consensus of the professional analysts is right on the mark, and this happened to be one of those times. Apple's revenue did come in above their guidance range but didn't exceed it by much. As summarized by Philip Elmer-Dewitt , the analyst average revenue estimate was $49.5 billion vs. the actual $49.6 billion. Analyst average EPS was $1.81 vs. the actual $1.85. Here's a summary of my pre-earnings estimates compared with the actual results: iPhone: Even the analysts were caught a little flat footed by iPhone sales in the quarter. As reported by PED , the consensus estimate was for 49.4 million vs. the actual 47.5 million. Joining me in my bullishness for the iPhone was KGI's Ming-Chi Kuo , who estimated 54.2 million iPhones shipped for the quarter. Apple achieved an impressive 35% y/y shipment growth, which could have been higher but for a couple of factors. Apple allowed iPhone inventory to draw down by 600,000 units, as disclosed by CFO Luca Maestri during the conference call . This was clearly in anticipation of the iPhone 6s release and may indicate that the new iPhone will debut a little earlier than the normal late September time frame. The other factor affecting shipments was the competition from the Samsung Galaxy S6. My take on this is still the same as I indicated in Apple Clobbers Samsung in China . Samsung has delivered at most a glancing blow to the iPhone, and I expect the next iPhone to turn the tide in Apple's favor once again. Mac: Mac sales did about as well as I anticipated in my Mac sales preview article . As anticipated, IDC's recent sales estimate was much closer to what Apple actually reported. It would have been higher if Apple had been able to achieve supply-demand balance for the latest MacBook with Retina Display, which is still back-ordered several weeks on the online Apple Store. iPad: Sales still declined, but at a slower rate than in the past. We may be seeing a bottom soon in iPad sales. Apple also allowed iPad channel inventory to draw down by 300,000 units, suggesting that an iPad refresh or new iPad Pro also is on the way for the September quarter. Watch: Apple, didn't announce specific unit shipments for the Watch, supposedly because this is competition sensitive. It might as well have released the number, anyway. Maestri and Cook both acknowledged that the sequential change in the other category of $952 million was all due to the Watch. Taking this as the Watch revenue for the quarter, we can back out unit sales following the methodology I outlined in my Watch sales preview . At an estimated ASP of $450, sales are about 2.1 million for the quarter. This is still better than initial sales for the iPhone and about the same as the iPad in roughly the same time frame of 60 days initial availability, a significant achievement for a new product launch. This is still considerably less than the final pro consensus reported by PED of 4.07 million. Clearly, the supply constraints were much more severe in their impact than we realized. The low sales figure also confirms my theory that in store sales are vital to the success of the Watch. Late June was when the Watch became widely available in Apple retail stores. As I pointed out in my preview, the Watch is not something that people want to buy sight unseen online. On the conference call, Cook deliberately contradicted the widely reported analysis of Slice . He stated categorically that sales turned up by the end of June. This also confirms my theory about the Slice data that it under reported Watch sales as sales shifted to in-store rather than online. Cook indicated that as of the conference call, Apple has finally achieved supply-demand balance. Now that the Watch is available for sale in Apple's retail stores, we'll finally get a better idea of what the demand really is. Cook also indicated that he anticipates higher sales volume for the December quarter as consumers gift the Watch. OPEX: Apple's operating expenses grew to $5.6 billion, while I had been expecting $5.8 billion. The difference was mainly due to slightly lower R&D at $2.0 billion vs. my expectation of $2.2 billion. Apple guided to a midpoint of $50 billion in revenue, a 19% y/y increase compared to last year, when the iP6 was introduced. This is probably conservative, but it bodes well for the "difficult comps" that Apple supposedly faces in the last two quarters of the calendar year. If Apple makes this level of growth in the September quarter, we'll probably see similar growth in the December quarter. This could be impacted however by the timing of the release of the iPhone 6s. Apple may move the release date up in the quarter in order to drive sales. The steep afterhours drop will undoubtedly dismay some investors who recently bought in, especially if they were expecting a post-earnings pop. Apple is not a good stock for a short-term momentum play. It doesn't enjoy the kind of irrational exuberance of Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) or even Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ). The main argument against Apple continues to play on the fear that Apple can't sustain its current level of growth. Such arguments are successful because they are self-evident as well as appealing to investor insecurity. It's self-evident that Apple won't continue to grow at 30%-plus y/y. So what? Apple will continue to grow double digits and pursue greater capital returns. Apple's cash pile now exceeds $200 billion. Irrational fear may drive the stock even lower, as Apple's growth slowdown is portrayed as if it were a contraction. This is just a buying opportunity. Eventually, as Apple continues to outgrow competitors such as Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Google and Samsung (OTC: SSNLF ), the market will wake up to Apple's long-term value.
