Prentis Wilson, the key Amazon executive responsible for Amazon Business was pressured by the FTC to say things that he knew to be untrue in order to benefit the government's case. The FTC denies the judge's allegations. The merger arbitrage spread is $2.41. The FTC continues to believe that Staples will dominate Amazon in the market for selling pens, etc. to big businesses*. *This is the same FTC that also believed that the market-dominating combo of Blockbuster and Hollywood Video would crush competition in video. Key to the FTC's analysis was to ignore competition from the likes of Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ). Today, Staples dominates, except for Amazon. By the same standard, countless mom and pop bookstores also dominate their marketâ€¦ except for Amazon. Starboard seeks to replace the current Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) board with its own directors.
