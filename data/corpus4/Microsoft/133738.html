After leaving Solitaire off Windows 8, forcing PC users who needed to fill that procrastinatory urge to download the program separately, Microsoft made many customers happy when i t announced that it’d be including the game in Windows 10 . While that’s all well and good, some players might be irked to know that the new Solitaire is a freemium — meaning if you want an ad-free experience and access to other premium features, you’ll have to pay. The new Windows 10 version of Microsoft Solitaire is included by default, but there are some features locked behind a paywall: it’ll cost $1.49 a month or $9.99 a year to get rid of ads, gain access to more coins (Solitaire’s in game currency) for completing daily challenges and have the chance to earn boosts in Tripeaks and Pyramid games. This isn’t the first time Microsoft has offered an upgrade, though the difference here is that Windows 10 has Solitaire bundled in, while the game had to be downloaded from Microsoft’s store with Windows 8. That version also included separate paid additions that could be downloaded.
