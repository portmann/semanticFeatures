The Web giant promises not to charge subscription fees to business clients until their existing enterprise agreement for Office or another rival solution runs out, and to pay up to $25 per user to help cover deployment costs. Microsoft, aided by its support for on-premise apps to go with cloud and mobile apps, has thus far done a decent job of keeping Google Apps at bay in spite of Apps' aggressive pricing ($50-$120 per user per year). Office 365 consumer subs totaled 15.2M at the end of the June quarter; commercial subs haven't been broken out. Hopefully they can pry some $$ from the rest of the board to give the next Dividend increase a meaningful BOOST !
