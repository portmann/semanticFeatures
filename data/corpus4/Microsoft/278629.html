ETF Hub Jan  1 2016, 03:30 ET | About: Apple Inc. (AAPL) | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor Despite record-breaking earnings and continued market growth in the face of withering industry headwinds, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) closed out 2015 lower for first time since 2008. However, the percentage of decline differs drastically; The stock ended the year down 4.6% at $105.26, while in 2008 it shed 56.9%. Notable events in 2015: Apple unveiled a slew of new products, including the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, Apple Watch, iPad Pro, Apple Music, and replaced AT&T in the Dow Jones industrial average. Long here too but I am worried because of irrational sentiment.  That can take a long time to correct. Agree irrational sentiment. How is it that Amazon is this ridiculous price and Apple gets dumped on all the time.  Here's hoping the results defy the analysts once again.  The result in the September Quarter was so good and yet Apple was dumped on again.  Irrational I wouldn't be worried if I were long right now with a position started a long time ago because it's better not to try to time the market when talking about quality stocks like AAPL at nice valuations if you're not a trader, BUT, if you're thinking about a fresh new long position, like me because I had to sold it back in august to cover my money losing oil related positions, it would be better to wait until april/summer, dead money until iPhone 7 IMO This is not surprising, to me, at least.  I've been correct in projecting that AAPL would high an all-time high on the original iPhone 6 product cycle: and so far in projecting that AAPL investors would have done best to take profits then.  My next article details what Apple is likely to do to amend the situation.  It will go public at the end of January, but readers will need to follow me to be notified at that point, as it won't be AAPL tagged. Click on my name, and then on the Follow button.  You can also elect real-time notifications, if you like. Just stop it with the link baits already! You are one of the worsts about it.... 2 anecdotes about apple... my son who is a apple lover asked for the surface from microsoft and is loving it...my i mac has the grey screen of death after a short 8 years of use....is apple coming down to earth ?? i would say yes "after a short 8 years of use..." Funny. Haha, a short 8 years of use. That must be something like 105 years for human beings! Hooking up with IBM not a good idea. The contagion effect. One year total returns:  AAPL -3% vs T +8%.  Curse of the DOW.  Long AAPL and T, but this year thank God for my T and my S&W. I mean is the decline all from projected sales from the iPhone being lower or slower growth in China? Either way, I'm not disagreeing Apple has problems to face but it's still such a strong stock that I think the amount of decline is irrational, only a matter of time until it hits back up into the 120's and beyond. when your paying three times the cost of generic computer you would expect 3 times the longevity for the mac say at least 15 years You don't get three times the longevity. You get three times the performance. Has a Tom Ford suit 3x the durability of an Hugo Boss suit? Not at all, but it's better looking and more exclusive. Just reminds me how the market missed Apple just because of a few misinformed analysts. What a bunch of sheep. Get ready for another record quarter. Good luck and stand long! With "high the all-time high" in your language up there, people are unlikely to follow your words. Silly reasoning. You must be kidding. Lol This one takes the "Click Bait of Year" trophy home already. This one takes home the "Click Bait of The Year" trophy already.
