Apple In The Enterprise: Investors Shouldn't Get Excited Yet - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple's presence in the enterprise is still something of a hobby, despite recent claims by CEO Tim Cook. Apple has achieved a commanding lead in enterprise mobile devices, but this lead may be eroding. If Apple is really serious, it will provide more transparency for investors, as well as an alternative to the Wintel PC platform that is attractive to enterprise. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) CEO Tim Cook announced on Tuesday that Apple had made $25 billion in revenue from sales to the enterprise in the past 12 months. While this is not bad news, it's far from actionable investment intelligence. Apple remains somewhat awkward in the enterprise, despite partnerships with IBM (NYSE: IBM ) and Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ). Apple still needs to get serious in important ways by offering personal computers that businesses actually want, and by breaking down enterprise revenue in its financial reports. Cook's announcement during the interview by Box CEO Aaron Levie exploded all over the Internet the next day. Although I try to stay as positive as I reasonably can about Apple, as an Apple investor, I found myself more annoyed than encouraged. What did the $25 billion really mean? It's about 14% of the company's revenue for the past year. Okay, that's not chump change, but as a growth/value investor, what I care about is rates of change in revenue and earnings. A single data point can't tell me how fast the enterprise business is growing, if at all. Apple's enterprise business may be growing overall, but is that due to the much publicized partnerships with IBM and Cisco? It's difficult to tell. According to a report released by Good Technology for Q2, iOS devices remain dominant overall in the enterprise with a 64% share of activations registered by Good's device management software. However, this was a decline compared to 70% of activations in Q1. In tablets specifically, the iPad fell from 81% of activations in Q1 to 64%. Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Android and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Windows tablets both grew at iPad's expense. Good's iOS data suggests that Apple is not in fact growing in the enterprise, but may be losing ground. As I've often pointed out, q/q variations are not always significant. Apple's new product releases tend to be on an annual cycle, with sales peaking in the December quarter due to new releases in the Fall. So Good's numbers may simply mirror the larger seasonality that Apple products go through. Good's data also doesn't include Mac OS X systems, and so doesn't reveal the full picture of Apple enterprise revenue. Once again, Cook's single data point can offer no insight into the revenue profile for the past year. If Apple wants to convince investors and clients that it's serious about business, it needs to start breaking out its enterprise revenue on a quarterly basis the way the big boys do. It would also be helpful if investors could get a breakdown by device and service category as well. The fact that Apple doesn't do this simply telegraphs to the world that it isn't quite ready for the big leagues. That really needs to change. Although Apple still maintains a dominant position in mobile devices on the strength of the iPhone and iPad, that's as far as it goes. For mainstream business computing, Wintel laptops and desktops are still the rule. A recent article in infoworld.com was only able to offer a few anecdotes of Mac usage in corporate enterprise: Cisco Systems now has about 20% of its users on Macs. The article tried to make the case that total cost of ownership is no worse for Macs than for Windows PCs, despite the higher purchase price. This may be true, but it's probably a tough sell to IT departments. As obsolete desktops are being replaced in the enterprise, they're almost always replaced by laptops. IT departments know they can get a very powerful Windows laptop for around $500, whereas the lowest cost Mac laptop is about twice that. While iPads may be a good fit for specific usage scenarios where the compact tablet form factor is essential, iPads as general purpose PCs still fall short in the office. For general purpose computing and office work, a MacBook would be a better choice than the iPad, even the iPad Pro. If Apple really wants to compete in the enterprise, it needs to produce an affordable laptop. Maybe not a $500 laptop, but something that gets well under $1000. Then, maybe with IBM's help, Apple could make a case for lower TCO. Here's a role for IBM, especially if IBM is selling a device management package to the enterprise that has a guaranteed service and support cost structure. Well, I'm not holding my breath for that affordable MacBook. With the iPad Pro, Apple seems to be staking its personal computing future on iOS and variants of the iPad. There are significant advantages to focusing on iOS rather than Mac OS X. iOS represents a clean sheet operating system design that exercises much more control over apps and how they're developed. It's more secure as a consequence. Users can't (without jailbreaking) download apps outside of the app store. All apps exist within "sandboxes" that isolate each app from the other. This makes the OS more resilient to crashes by apps, as well as keeps apps from accessing data from other apps. These are both characteristics that have endeared iOS to government and regulated industry users. According to Good, iOS continues to be strongest in the public sector, with 79% of activations. Mac OS X has an App Store, and apps from the Store must be sandboxed. But Mac OS X also allows apps downloaded from anywhere, as well as older style non-sandboxed apps. Windows 10 is more or less in the same position. It has an app store with sandboxed apps, but it also has to support the huge legacy of Windows software. The clean sheet approach of iOS may well be better than trying to transition the legacy operating systems to the newer approach. This seems to be why Apple is pushing iOS more as an enterprise solution. If that's the case, then iOS has some growing up to do. We're seeing that in the iPad Pro. The iPad Pro supports multitasking, and will probably feature what may be an incredibly powerful processor, based on what the new iPhone 6s is capable of . iOS 9 is also starting to bow somewhat to practicality by supporting a new cursor mode in which the keyboard area of the screen behaves like a conventional trackpad for manipulating an on-screen text cursor. Apple needs to go a step further in iOS and support an external mouse or track pad, which Android has done for years. Apple has been overly fastidious in wanting to preserve the purity of the iOS user interface. The new track pad mode is a sign that Apple is becoming more pragmatic about iOS. Once Apple makes this simple change, it really will have an operating system that can replace Mac OS X for most personal computing applications, and begin to challenge Wintel in the enterprise.
