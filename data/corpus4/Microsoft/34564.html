Don't Buy Procter & Gamble, Buy Microsoft Instead - The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) | Seeking Alpha P&G enjoys a tremendous reputation for its dividend. Underneath the surface, the company's dividend growth has slowed significantly in recent years, as its sales and earnings have stagnated. P&G offers a nice 3% yield, but very weak dividend growth. As a result, dividend growth investors can do better. Similarly, Microsoft offers a nearly 3% yield. But unlike P&G, Microsoft has maintained very strong dividend growth in recent years, thanks to its stronger fundamentals. Microsoft generates huge free cash flow, which allows it to increase its dividend at much higher rates than P&G. Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG ) recently increased its dividend, and thus extended its very long streak of annual dividend growth. P&G is a Dividend Aristocrat, and has now come through with 59 consecutive years of increased dividends. To be sure, P&G has a long and very impressive dividend track record. But whether it's a good dividend stock to buy now is a much different question. P&G delivered just a 3% dividend raise this year. In my previous P&G article , I detailed my expectations for P&G's 2015 dividend increase. Suffice it to say, P&G's dividend increase was below even my modest expectations. P&G, like many consumer staples stocks, is having a hard time growing. Revenue and profits are declining, due to a brutal foreign exchange headwind. But even after excluding currency, there isn't much growth taking place. At this point, I don't see a compelling reason to buy P&G. The stock trades for a premium valuation while revenue and earnings aren't growing. P&G offers a 3.1% dividend yield, which is decent enough, but there are plenty of other stocks investors can buy for 3% yields and much stronger future dividend growth. I believe Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) is just such a stock. P&G's long history of dividend increases overshadows the fact that its dividend growth has slowed significantly in recent years. In 2013, P&G increased its dividend by 7.1%. Last year, the increase was 6.9%, and its dividend growth fell again to 3% this year. The reason for this is because P&G isn't growing. Over the first two quarters of its current fiscal year, net sales and earnings from continuing operations declined 2% and 7%, respectively , year over year. In the first two quarters of its current fiscal year, P&G distributed 67% of its quarterly free cash flow as a dividend. With such low growth, there isn't much room for stronger dividend increases. Not only is P&G struggling to grow, but I believe it's also overvalued. The stock trades for 25 times earnings, a significant premium to the broader market. The S&P 500 Index trades for 20 times earnings. P&G's valuation is especially a concern because its sales and earnings growth is so weak, making it extremely unlikely that the company's earnings will grow quickly enough to justify such an above-average multiple. In turn, its weak earnings growth has resulted in weak dividend increases as well. P&G's bloated valuation and tiny dividend increases are red flags. In comparison, Microsoft trades for a much more reasonable 17 times earnings. Microsoft is cheaper than the S&P 500, and it's much less aggressively valued than P&G. This is confusing since Microsoft's fundamentals are in better shape. Microsoft's revenue grew 8% last quarter despite an equally strong currency headwind. Operating profit declined, but by just 2%. Still, Microsoft is a cash machine. In the first two quarters of its current fiscal year, Microsoft raked in $9.9 billion of free cash flow. It paid $4.8 billion of dividends in this time. In comparison to P&G, which is distributing two-thirds of its free cash flow, Microsoft holds a more modest 48% free cash flow payout ratio. In addition, Microsoft has a bullet-proof balance sheet. It's one of only three U.S. companies to hold a triple-A credit rating from Standard & Poor's. Moreover, Microsoft has $90 billion in cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet. P&G's dividend is about 30-40 basis points higher than Microsoft's right now, but Microsoft's stronger growth and cash-stuffed balance sheet allow it to increase its dividend at much higher rates than P&G. Over the past five years, Microsoft grew its dividend by 19% compounded annually. This is more than double P&G's dividend growth in the same period. Take A Pass On P&G, Go For Microsoft Instead I'm sitting on some spare cash in my IRA, and I'm looking for my next dividend stock to buy. Among my list of requirements for investment, I like to see at least a 3% dividend yield, a strong balance sheet, and a highly profitable business that generates a lot of free cash flow. P&G briefly came across my radar, because as I alluded to earlier, it's a legendary dividend stock. But I soon realized investors can do better. P&G stock is overvalued, its revenue and earnings are stagnating, and its most recent dividend increase was a disappointment. By contrast, Microsoft looks like a much better dividend stock. The stock is much cheaper on a valuation basis, and will grow its dividend much faster. As a result, I believe Microsoft has much more to offer than P&G for dividend growth investors.
