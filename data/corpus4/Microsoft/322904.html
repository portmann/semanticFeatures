Apple: Addressing The Court Order Without Giving US Security Agencies Carte Blanche Access - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Tim Cook is correct to resist US government requests for backdoor access to all iPhones. Such a move could have severe consequences for Apple's overseas sales. The binary "solutions" commonly discussed are either give the government access to all iPhones, or not. The best solution would be compromise: give the government access to only the iPhones they have a warrant to unlock. If Apple caves (or is forced to cave..) and provides US intelligence agencies like the FBI, CIA and NSA a backdoor into the iPhone, the international blowback could be substantial. China is the near-term growth catalyst for iPhone sales. Investors should consider that Chinese consumers may not want US intelligence agencies eavesdropping on their cell phone calls or have access to their phone's data. The same is true in Europe as well - just ask Angela Merkel . The response from many countries when Edward Snowden spoke of a backdoor in Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ) routers is applicable here as well. A key report found that key enterprise vendors like Cisco Systems, HP (NYSE: HPQ ), IBM (NYSE: IBM ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) lost sales in Brazil, China and Russia as a result of Snowden's revelations. In Cisco's case, reports that the NSA was secretly inserting backdoor surveillance tools in routers, switches, servers and other networking equipment hurt foreign sales. A backdoor to the iPhone would likely affect its sales as well. On Tuesday, a U.S. magistrate judge in California ordered Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) to help the FBI break into the iPhone of San Bernardino terrorist Syed Farook. Apple CEO Tim Cook argued that meeting the FBI's request in the case would weaken the security of all iPhones everywhere. In an open letter published Wednesday, Cook said .... the government's demands are chilling. â€¦ We are challenging the FBI's demands with the deepest respect for American democracy and a love of our country. Other Silicon Valley CEOs are supporting Apple. As Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies, put it: It is true that (the government) is positioning this as an isolated case, but because of the way our justice system works, it becomes a precedent, and once a precedent is set, (the government) or other cases can come back and use this to try and get the same action in the future" he said. Bajarin suggested that if Apple sets the precedent for the U.S. government to access the iPhone contents via "brute force," Russia and China would likely follow suit. So this is a big deal. I'm surprised Apple shares have held up as well as they have. That said, there has lately been a 600 point rally in the Dow over the past three days and one could view APPL's performance as somewhat muted during that time: There is no way Apple should give US intelligence agencies carte blanche backdoor access to all iPhones. Not only would this compromise the privacy of its customers, but once such a backdoor exists and the many intelligence employees know how it works, it would just be a matter of time before criminal elements attain the knowledge as well. What Apple needs is not a binary solution (either give the government access to all iPhones or access to no iPhones). What is needed is a solution that will give the government access to a phone in which a warrant has been specifically issued to unlock a phone (not all phones). Apple establishes a small security group whose sole function is to interface with government requests to unlock a phone. The group will verify that the government indeed has an "unlock warrant" before taking any action. If so, a single Apple employee will meet with a single government official in a secured room at the Apple main facility in Cupertino. A separate Apple employee, behind a wall from which only he/she's arms protrude and behind a one-way mirror window, will operate equipment to unlock the phone while the government agent watches. The entire process is monitored by an additional Apple employee and an additional government agent sitting in another, separate one-way mirrored room. Apple keeps strict records of all warrants and all phones that have been unlocked. The two-way mirror and room separation is provided to conceal the Apple employee's identity as he/she likely does not want intelligence spooks outside his/her's bedroom window at 2:45am in the morning. Apple will design the iOS encryption/security scheme such that only that particular phone will be unlocked and there will be no information that would enable the government to learn, from the unlocked state of that specific phone, how to unlock any or all other iPhones. Apple also must fully secure the encryption code and keys that are involved in the unlocking of the phone as well as what employees get access to the code and equipment involved. No one person will own the entire key. It should be spread out in a well designed manner, over several employees. While this scheme is not 100% secure, the assumption is that Apple has a vested interest in keeping the scheme secure and will take all possible action to engineer as secure a solution as possible. I look forward to a healthy discussion in the comment section. Constructive criticism is certainly welcome. This process would appear to solve all issues: The government can gain access to any phone in which it has been properly issued an "unlock warrant." Apple protects the privacy of its current and future customer base and complies with properly issued court orders. If this scheme - or some variation of this scheme - is not agreed upon, and Apple gives the US government carte blanche backdoor access to all iPhones, it could have severe consequences to iPhone sales going forward - especially overseas but also here at home. Apple shareholders are advised to pay attention. So should Apple iPhone owners.
