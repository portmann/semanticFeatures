Fitbit Is In Good Shape - Fitbit, Inc. (NYSE:FIT) | Seeking Alpha Shares of Fitbit rose 48% in their debut on the New York Stock Exchange. The company is profitable, unlike many IPOs this year, and is in a good position in its market. Despite fears that Apple might destabilize the company's operations, Fitbit shouldn't see significant pressure from Cupertino, since the wearable tech market sandbox is big enough for everyone. Fitbit already has a commanding market presence and should be able to continue building momentum, especially with its acquisition of the Fitstart app. Fitness wearable tech company Fitbit (NYSE: FIT ) sprinted upward in its market debut, seeing its shares rise 48% and close at $29.68 per share, up from an opening price of $20 per share. It's worthy of note that the Initial Public Offering (IPO) saw significant upward revision in the weeks leading up to the offering. The day before Fitbit went public, the company finally priced its initial public offering at $20 a share. This exceeded its prior estimates of $17 to $19 per share, which was already a step up from Fitbit's initial projections of $14 to $16 a share. So clearly, many investors wanted a slice of the action at Fitbit by bidding up the share price, and arguably for good reason. Fitbit is in good shape to ride the rising tide of the wearable tech market, despite the advances of tech titan Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). Fitbit is one of few IPOs this year that is actually a profitable company now. Revenue rocketed 174% last year to $745 million. And in its most recent quarter, Fitbit's sales have tripled to $336.8 million. At this point, the firm is now valued at about $6.5 billion. Considering the rate of growth for Fitbit, and the potential for the wearable tech industry overall, this valuation is seemingly high, but justifiable. I believe three big factors have led to this strong growth at Fitbit. Fitbit's technology offers a wide array of features for its users at a good price point. As the Los Angeles Times reports, "Fitbit, formed in 2007, provides a multi-platform approach to health and fitness, integrating mobile apps and websites with sleek, colorful devices that track data such as steps taken and calories burned. They can be worn as bracelets or clipped to clothing." The Apple Watch, for comparison, is currently on the Apple website at the low, low price of $550 and up! And speaking of the Apple Watch ... Apple is actually helping Fitbit by raising public awareness for the wearable tech industry. As the old adage goes, a rising tide lifts all the boats in the harbor. Research firm IDC forecasts the global wearables market to grow 173.3% this year with 72.1 million units shipped. And as Forbes notes: Although many people might bring up Apple Watch as a Fitbit killer, [Fitbit CEO James] Park tries to come across diplomatic as possible. "We think the market is so big that it's not really about competition," said Park, "it's actually about raising consumer awareness. There's over $200 billion spent in health and fitness products every year in the U.S. Penetration is still pretty low. Our growth speaks to the fact that it's a massive opportunity for a lot of different companies...There's clearly an opportunity for coexistence. It's not one or the other. People have a lot of different preferences. It's good to have a lot of options for the consumer out there." At this time, the wearable tech market is in its infantile stages. The landscape hasn't fully developed yet, and the market isn't going to develop into the Hunger Games that is the smartphone sphere overnight. This time will allow Fitbit to boost its research and development as well as its sales, as its sector of the tech industry heats up. Fitbit is already in a good position in the wearable tech market and can build upon its previous successes. The Apple Watch will certainly have more features and functionality than Fitbit's gadgets; however, that will actually work to Fitbit's advantage. Fitbit will be able to market its more focused products to people who don't want to blow a half grand or even more just to get a techy watch. Fitbit is a more nuanced, streamlined product that's solely focused on fitness. The Apple Watch is intended to accomplish a large number of things other than fitness applications. So Fitbit will be able to benefit from a customer base that only wants fitness products at a lower price. Fitbit has a commanding 34.2% market share of the 11.4 million wearables shipped in the first quarter of 2015, and its nearest rival is Xiaomi, which has about 24.6%. In terms of dollars and cents, Fitbit has an even more astounding lead: 85% . The difference between Fitbit and Xiaomi is that Fitbit's products do cost more, but have more functionality than the Xiaomi Mi Band. And Fitbit is in the beginning stages of an increased marketing campaign that highlights its blend of relatively low costs with impressive software capabilities. Fitbit also has another relatively untapped avenue of revenue to draw upon in the coming years: the Fitstar app , which Fibit purchased a couple of months ago. The app is offered on multiple platforms, but also has a $50 subscription plan available. Fitbit also offers a $50 a year premium account for users and has its own app, so the company is getting the best of both worlds. The firm has its own independent fitness products, but also has an app available on Apple, Google, and Microsoft devices. So every increase in those company's sales could indirectly have a positive effect on Fitbit. However, so far, the revenue from that aspect of Fitbit's business is tiny, at about 1% of overall revenue. The Fitstart purchase is an indicator that the company is seeking to expand its subscription model, which is a prudent move, as subscriptions can provide a good source of recurring revenue. Fitstart is a popular fitness app, and its acquisition should prove to be beneficial for Fitbit over the long run. In summation, we are standing on the cusp of a coming wearable tech revolution, and Fitbit is in a great position to profit from this developing market. Although Apple Watch will appeal to many in the high-end market, Fitbit will be able to continue gaining momentum with its more reasonably priced products.
