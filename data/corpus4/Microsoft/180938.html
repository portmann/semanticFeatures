Microsoft: Strengthening Ecosystem Means Shares Are A Good Value Here - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha L&F Capital Management , L&F Capital Management (419 clicks) Although MSFT is not a growth stock with massive upside, strong management and cash flows provide solid downside protection as the company puts its forward-thinking transition plan in motion. The company has consistently brought in more than $20 billion in free cash flow every year over the past five years, with average FCF per year north of $25 billion. A strong dividend yield and working capital provide a safe cushion for investors as technically the stock looks ready to rise on any good news. Shares of Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) have traded sideways for a year now, with spikes offsetting subsequent dips. We believe the result is an attractively valued stock with a great dividend yield, excellent management and a forward-thinking transition plan in motion that has already yielded strong results in its early stages. Overall, we feel that while MSFT is not a growth stock that will create 20%-plus upside for investors, we do believe MSFT is a relatively risk-free investment sitting on and producing lots of cash annually. Microsoft currently has a net current asset value, or NCAV, or $28.57 billion. On the most recent July 27, 2015, share count of 7.997 billion, this equates to roughly $3.57 in NCAV. At a market quote of $43.92, this means MSFT is trading at 12.29x NCAV. When actually interpreting this multiple, we believe it is extremely favorable for a cash-generating company like Microsoft. We like to think of the fair value of a company as the net present value of all future free cash flows plus NCAV. So from this standpoint, we believe the market is valuing the net present value of all future free cash flows at $322.7 billion (current market capitalization of $351.27 billion less NCAV of $28.572 billion). From our standpoint, if the net present value of all future free cash flows is substantially greater than this $351.27 billion, the stock is a good long. Microsoft has long been known as a cash cow. The company has raked in more than $20 billion in free cash flow every year over the past five years, with the trailing five-year average FCF per year being $25.69 billion . The company has generated $128.43 billion of FCF over the past five years, which is roughly 35% of the required NPV FCF of $351.27 billion. Microsoft is certainly a business in transition, and it's unfair to extrapolate historical performance to judge the future performance of a business in transition, but we do believe these historical cash flow figures hold merit when considering the valuation. When talking about the future of the operating business, we believe Microsoft is taking the right steps to ensure continued strong revenue, earnings and cash flow growth. Perhaps the smallest area the company is making big moves in is with its Xbox gaming console, and we believe the company is set to have Xbox sales undergo healthy growth this holiday season. Total Xbox revenue was up 27% , with platform revenue up 10% driven by volume growth from 1.1 million to 1.4 million. We believe the Xbox platform is continuing to distinguish itself from the Playstation platform. Xbox is surging in popularity , and the backwards compatibility adds a huge bonus for the Xbox One over the PS4. This holiday season, Xbox platform sales should surge with an impressive suite of games being released, including the new Halo, Call of Duty and Star Wars Battlefront installments. Retailers such as GameStop (NYSE: GME ) are offering these games bundled with Xbox One and PS4 systems, and we believe these bundle offerings will create an uptick in the upgrade cycle for these new-gen gaming platforms. This is the strongest line-up set to release for the new consoles yet, and will finally give reason for many of the older gen users to make the transition. Moreover, Xbox Live sales grew MRFY with hardware sales, and this is a good sign of growing ARR, something Microsoft is focused on. In the video game market, many analysts believe the traditional box hardware video gaming market has peaked and that box gaming has ceded and will continue to cede market share to mobile and tablet gaming. It appears Microsoft is positioning itself and its Xbox platform for this jump, attempting to possibly integrate its current gaming infrastructure with the Surface . Regardless of where the gaming market heads (hardware consoles or mobile/tablet gaming), we believe that Microsoft is aptly positioned to profit from the gaming market. This precludes a discussion of the Surface and the success that Microsoft seems positioned to reap. Surface sales grew 117% YoY, starkly contrasting to Apple's continued weak iPad performance. The growing demand for 2-in-1s and increased spending in the IoT (Internet of Things) market promises that demand for the tablet will remain high. Seamless integration with Windows 10 only bolsters the attractiveness and utility of the Surface, and we believe current trends indicate demand for the Surface will increase. It should be noted here that Windows 10 adoption has been extremely high , further evidence of Microsoft's continually strengthening and expanding ecosystem. Microsoft's commercial cloud business is booming on multiple fronts, with commercial cloud ARR growing 96% in constant currency to $8 billion. Office 365 subs base grew 3 million MRQ to 15.2 million by quarter's end. While Microsoft Azure still significantly lags AWS, it has plenty of growth ahead of it given brand name affiliation in a hugely growing market. We also believe that despite the dying commercial licensing business, ramped up Office 365 adoption will continue and is indicative of Microsoft being able to replace and even exceed lost software revenue almost wholly. According to Bitglass , Office 365 adoption has more than tripled in the past year, rising to 25.2% of enterprises. Office 365 is now the most widely used business cloud application of any type. We fully expected this, as we believe that Microsoft's former 90% share of the business productivity software market naturally implies a huge share of the SaaS business productivity market. As customers ditch Microsoft software, it's a natural and convenient step to transition to Office 365. On the search engine side, Bing grew market share to 20.2% MRQ and looks to be profitable this year - a footnote in Microsoft's strengthening and expanding ecosystem. There are several moving parts that comprise the Microsoft machine, and we believe many of these moving parts are operating fluidly and look nicely positioned to generate higher ARR and profit margins in the near future. All things considered, we believe the current market value is underwhelming relative to Microsoft's potential future cash flows. A 3.3% dividend yield and $74.9 billion in working capital provide a nice cushion for investors, and we believe the stock is technically positioned to rise on any good news. If the company can generate somewhere near its five-year trailing average FCF of $25 billion per year, the stock is undervalued here.
