Is Apple More Vulnerable Than Microsoft To Trends In Mobile? Probably - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha As users turn increasingly to mobile, Windows and Office seem less relevant. As users turn increasingly to Android, Windows and iOS seem less relevant. Windows seems to have better staying power than iOS. SA Author Benedict Evans wrote a terrific article setting out the need for Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) to capitulate in order to clear the decks to rebuild itself in an increasingly mobile world but failing to suggest just how Microsoft might do that. Evans points out quite accurately that consumers don't really want or need Windows or Office any more, are increasingly turning to mobile for their wants and needs, and while the desktop or laptop may have a future that future is - like the fax machine - on the wane. His most telling point is the decline in the percentage of devices that today use a Microsoft OS, something like 15%. His very effective and compelling chart is reproduced below: Evans article speaks to an issue that confronts not only Microsoft but also Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) - the risk of irrelevance as share of devices falls. The one platform Microsoft is beating is the combined iOS and OS X usage of Apple. Today's article by Emma Haslett in Tech News sums it up - analysts think Windows will continue to outsell Apple's platforms although Android seems destined to win. Despite analyst's enthusiasm for the market's strong acceptance of the iPhone 6 models, Apple Q2 results were a disappointment to many who had visions of growth in China propelling Apple to a recovery of market share it had lost in recent years. Apple did have very strong sales in the robust China market, but nonetheless saw its market share drop to 12%, well behind industry leader Xiaomi who surged to 18%, and eclipsed by a resurgent Huawei who now holds 16% of the China market. Apple faces a different problem than Microsoft, and that problem is Samsung. Apple has tried to position itself as an aspirational brand to command high prices and high margins, with considerable success. But the venerable iPhone continues to lag premium Android phones in quality, reliability and processing power, at least in my opinion. The Samsung S6, for example, has enjoyed stellar sales pushing back sales of iPhones in many markets, according to Kantar World Markets. The Galaxy S6's success in meeting the iPhone 6 is not hard to understand. It is more powerful, has a better camera; has an outstanding screen; and, is backed by an increasingly competitive Android ecosystem with the population of Android devices passing iOS in 2013 and pulling away ever since. Each year, approximately 1 billion Android devices are sold compared with somewhere in the low 250 million range for iOS and MacOS based on my crude estimates. That suggests there is a transformation taking place, just as Benedict Evans suggests there is, and as Evans posits, it will affect Microsoft. It will also affect Apple. This chart from Statista makes the point. As Android becomes the new Windows, strategic issues confront the other platforms. In my view, Apple has as much at stake as Microsoft, but without a base in enterprise, Apple is the more vulnerable to the trends. At close to $50 Microsoft seems fully priced. At $120 Apple shares appear vulnerable. I have no position in Microsoft and remain short Apple. Source: Is Apple More Vulnerable Than Microsoft To Trends In Mobile?
