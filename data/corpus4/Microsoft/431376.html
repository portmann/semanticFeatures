Microsoft's LinkedIn Buyout Is A Solid Move - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft is acquiring LinkedIn for $196 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at $26.2 billion. Faced with slower growth in all segments, Microsoft is making the right strategic decision, in my view. Near-term dilution, but also synergy and earnings accretion, could kick in starting FY18. Cross-selling Office products, penetration in mobile and scale up subscription-based revenue are key positives. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) is acquiring LinkedIn (NYSE: LNKD ) for $196/share in an all-cash transaction valued at $26.2b, inclusive of LNKD's net cash. Faced with slower revenue growth, the lack of a distinct mobile strategy and the need to push its office subscription services to the broader working professional group, MSFT's decision to acquire LNKD is a sound one in my view. Over time, MSFT could leverage LNKD's database and potentially cross-sell Office 365 products to LNKD's existing users, integrate Office products into LNKD's interface and provide a more comprehensive office/professional product suite than LNKD's current social-networking platform. As for LNKD, the offer is attractive and certainly worth tendering. Although I am bullish on LNKD's growth prospect in the niche professional social networking vertical, the biggest concern I have on the stock is the potential for Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) to go aggressive on building its own professional platform. Under such scenario, I am skeptical on whether LNKD could have sufficient resources to counter FB so being acquired by MSFT is by far the best outcome LNKD investors can hopeful. That said, I remain cautious on MSFT stock given that the acquisition will not have material impact in address the weak outlook on Azure, Office 365 and Commercial Cloud. As for LNKD, I recommend investors to tender the shares. MSFT's decision to acquire LNKD is the right move to scale up its subscription-based business model, expand its product suite for working professionals and gain exposure to mobile, where MSFT has often failed to expand. Recall that MSFT is facing decelerated growth on all three key segments. More concerning is that the company guided much weaker than expected outlook that came in below consensus. Although management cited the cloud transition is the reason behind the unfavorable impact, I expected Commercial Cloud and other segments to offset the weakness but it appears that slower growth is becoming a norm for the company. In light of these risks, LNKD's acquisition is designed to booster growth in both cloud and office. MSFT and LNKD can create an unrivalled professional services platform, in my view. First, MSFT can cross-sell office products to LNKD users so that a single LNKD account can be integrated across MSFT office, outlook, Skype and Windows. This could potentially strengthen Window's ecosystem among working professionals. Second, MSFT can integrate Cortana, MSFT's digital assistant, to LNKD members so that each user is updated with relevant meetings, project updates and new/potential contacts. This could drive both LNKD and Office MAU with incremental ad revenue being the icing on the cake. Third, the Intelligent Newsfeed on professional updates, industry-related news and events keep the MAUs engaged. Not only could this drive higher ad revenue on both PC and mobile but also drive Office 365 MAUs if users are looking to accomplish certain tasks (i.e., Outlook, file transfers) over LNKD. With LNKD's targeted ad gradually increase in sophistication, MSFT will benefit from higher ad pricing driven by an engaged user base. With 105m MAUs, and 60%+ traffic coming from mobile and rising number of page views and traffic, LNKD is the ideal platform of MSFT to leverage to expand its mobile footprint. Not only will MSFT-LNKD enhance productivity for the working professionals, they could also enhance marketing and talent management. On marketing, MSFT and LNKD will be focusing on social-based selling rather than the traditional sales approach. Social-based selling not only is more impactful but also allows sellers to deeper relationships with their prospects and customers, thereby driving higher results. On talent management, LNKD's rich database allows employers to have a better understanding of their talents and this insight is necessary to understand how to most effectively utilize the workforce to drive higher productivity. Finally, Lynda will be relevant from an HR perspective in that it drives learning and improvements within the workforce. The appropriate courses (via Lynda) and materials (via Office 365) could be pushed to employees via LNKD to foster learning at work place. Long-term speaking, interaction via MSFT's HoloLens among working professionals from multiple locations over LNKD is a distinct possibility, in my view. In short, acquiring LNKD is a right strategic move for MSFT. Although this deal will be dilutive by roughly 1% for MSFT's FY17 and FY18 earnings, $150m cost synergy could be realized in FY18 with earnings accretion materializing starting in FY19.
