Intel's Latest Processor Ready To Stimulate PC Sales - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha The introduction of Intel's 6th generation processor family along with Microsoft's new Windows 10 will stimulate the PC market and will benefit both companies. INTC has compelling valuation metrics and high earnings growth prospects; its EV/EBITDA ratio is very low at 5.61, the fifth lowest among all S&P 500 tech stocks. The company is generating strong free cash flows, and returns value to its shareholders through stock buyback and increasing dividend payments. The average target price of the top analysts is at $33.50, up 20.4% from its September 1 close price; however, in my opinion, shares could go higher than that. According to new data from two research firms, PC sales are continuing to fall sharply. Worldwide PC shipments totaled 68.4 million units in the second quarter of 2015, a 9.5% decline from the second quarter of 2014, according to preliminary results by Gartner . This was the steepest PC shipment decline since the third quarter of 2013. PC shipments are projected to decline 4.4% in 2015. According to IDC , worldwide PC shipments totaled 66.1 million units in the second quarter of 2015. This represented a year-on-year decline of 11.8%, about one percent below projections for the quarter. Although slightly different, both reports are painting a gloomy picture for the PC market. However, two new developments could convince both consumers and corporations to buy new computers. The first one is the recently launched Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Windows 10, which has been considered by many users the best Windows operating system. The second development is yesterday's introduction of Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) 6th generation processor family (Skylake), which is, according to the company, its best processor ever. According to Intel, there are over 500 million computers in use today that are four to five years old or older. They are slow to wake, their batteries don't last long, and they can't take advantage of all the new experiences available today. Built on the new Skylake microarchitecture on Intel's leading 14nm manufacturing process technology, 6th Gen Intel Core processors deliver up to two and a half times better performance, triple the battery life, and graphics that are 30 times better for seamless and smooth gaming and video experiences versus the average 5-year-old computer. They can also be half as thin and half the weight, have faster wake-up time, and battery life that lasts virtually all day. Microsoft's Windows 10 is also optimized for Skylake, meaning that users of Skylake-equipped hardware running the new operating system can expect results closer to top benchmarks than would have been likely with previous processor platforms. Although Windows 10 upgrades are free, Intel's CEO Brian Krzanich thinks customers will still have to get a new PC in order to fully enjoy all the best features offered on Windows 10, he explained in an earnings call: A lot of the really good features of Windows 10, things like Windows 10 Hello where you have facial log in, and you don't have to use all your passwords, the Start screen and your ability to go through that, the touch usages of gaming, as the new games come to this product - those are going to run on PCs that have the latest features. That, combined with products like Skylake over the long haul, I think Windows 10 will be a boost to the PC market. This might sound like wishful thinking by an interested person. However, in my view, it makes sense. After all, being fond of tablets, when it comes to work, PC is the choice, and we all feel frustrated when the old machine reacts so slowly. According to Mr. Krzanich, there's always a little bit of a stall right before a new product like Skylake, combined with a new OS like Windows 10, which the majority of these devices will run on. That tends to have people waiting to see what those products are going to be. However, in my opinion, after receiving excellent feedback from the new products, PC sales will recover. Many consumers and corporations have postponed their new computer upgrades waiting for a significant improvement, which, in my opinion, should have materialized with Microsoft's Windows 10 and Intel's Skylake processors. Stronger PC sales will benefit both companies, among others. INTC's stock has underperformed the market in the last few years. Year to date, the company is down 23.3%, while the S&P 500 index has decreased 7.0% and the NASDAQ Composite Index has lost 2.1%. Moreover, since the beginning of 2012, INTC has gained only 14.7%. In this period, the S&P 500 Index has increased 52.2% and the NASDAQ Composite Index has risen 78%. However, in my view, the recent retreat in Intel's price offers an excellent opportunity to buy the stock at an attractive price. According to TipRanks , the average target price of the top analysts is at $33.50, up 20.4% from its September 1 close price; however, in my opinion, shares could go higher than that. INTC's valuation is excellent, the trailing P/E is very low at 11.79, and the forward P/E is also very low at 11.99. Furthermore, its Enterprise Value/EBITDA ratio is very low at 5.61, the fifth lowest among all S&P 500 tech stocks. According to James P. O'Shaughnessy, the Enterprise Value/EBITDA ratio is the best-performing single value factor. In his impressive book, "What Works on Wall Street," Mr. O'Shaughnessy demonstrates that 46 years of back-testing, from 1963 to 2009, has shown that companies with the lowest EV/EBITDA ratio have given the best return. In addition, INTC's margins and return on capital parameters have been much better than its industry median, its sector median and the S&P 500 median, as shown in the tables below: In its latest quarter, the company generated approximately $3.4 billion in cash from operations, paid dividends of $1.1 billion, and used $697 million to repurchase 22 million shares of stock. Intel has been paying uninterrupted dividends since 1993. The forward annual dividend yield is pretty high at 3.45% and the payout ratio only 38.1%. The annual rate of dividend growth over the past three years was at 4.8%, over the past five years was at 10%, and over the past ten years was very high at 18.9%. According to Portfolio123's "All-Stars: Graham" ranking system, INTC's stock is ranked first among all S&P 500 tech stocks. The "All-Stars: Graham" ranking system is based on investing principles of the well-known investor Benjamin Graham. The ranking system is quite complex, and it is taking into account many factors like: trailing P/E ratio, price to book value, and EPS growth, as shown in the Portfolio123's chart below: In my view, the introduction of Intel's 6th generation processor family along with Microsoft's new Windows 10 will stimulate the PC market and will benefit both companies.
