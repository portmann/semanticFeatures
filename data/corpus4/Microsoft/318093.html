The Amazon-Netflix Alliance - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Netflix has completed its "cloud transition" to Amazon.com cloud services. Despite software that could let it get out, Netflix remains in with a primary competitor. Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) has finished its "cloud transition," the company says in a blog post . But there is a more important story here. That story is the Netflix-Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ) alliance, an alliance that only seems to have grown stronger with time. And the fact that it is just one of many such alliances. Netflix has not always felt easy about having its service served by a primary competitor. The company created its own Open Connect Network , a standard designed, in part, to make it less dependent on Amazon, better able to move traffic and storage to other cloud providers that might provide it with a better deal. Netflix now accounts for 37% of the Internet's traffic during peak viewing times - you can think of it as the 900-pound gorilla of Internet streaming. But after a seven-year transition, during which it did everything it could have done, technically, to reduce its dependence on Amazon Web Services, Netflix is signaling that it's more dependent than ever. In reporting on this Business Insider made a common mistake by comparing Amazon cloud revenues with those of Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ). They noted that Microsoft claimed $6.9 billion in cloud revenue last quarter , and Amazon $2 billion. (The original story calls this a one-year figure for Amazon, and I expect that correction will have been made by the time you read this.) But Amazon's revenue is almost entirely driven by cloud infrastructure, bare bones rental of its cloud data centers. Microsoft is selling software, booking that to cloud revenue when the software is used there. These are two different businesses. Despite Microsoft's efforts to compete with Amazon on price regarding bare bones infrastructure, Amazon's lead there continues to grow. Netflix might love to be less dependent on Amazon infrastructure, and it has spent hundreds of millions of dollars preparing to be less dependent on it. Yet it is dependent on it. Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) bit the bullet on this years ago, and began building its own cloud data centers, using cash flow from its basic business to do so. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) can easily afford the $1 billion/quarter cost of being in the game from its search business, and now from YouTube revenue. Microsoft has used software as an ante into the cloud game, and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is now investing the necessary cash to get into it, according to Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan . But Amazon's lead now has less to do with raw capital power and more to do with hard-won lessons learned in making that investment. Cloud has consolidated, and Amazon is the winner. This is not a box Netflix can get out of. The company reported revenue of $1.8 billion last quarter, against $35 billion for Amazon. It has about $1.8 billion of cash on its books, but it has committed that cash into its work in building a studio to rival Viacom's (NASDAQ: VIA ) (NASDAQ: VIAB ) Paramount, Disney (NYSE: DIS ), Fox (NASDAQ: FOX ) (NASDAQ: FOXA ), Time Warner (NYSE: TWX ) and Comcast's (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) Universal. That is its strategy, and throwing $1 billion/quarter into data centers would, at this point, make it impossible for the company to free itself from those content suppliers. Thus, Netflix has chosen to remain dependent on its primary competitor in net streaming. What is true for cloud infrastructure is also true for commerce infrastructure. Amazon has several billion-dollar "competitors" who use its delivery infrastructure to serve their customers. It has many other companies using its payment infrastructure, especially now that sales taxes on online sales are becoming routine, raising the cost of compliance beyond what many small players can afford. Amazon is an infrastructure company. Do not analyze it as a retailer. Do not analyze it as a streaming company. Don't even analyze it based on cloud revenues. Amazon is infrastructure, infrastructure on which global commerce is increasingly dependent. Disclosure: I am/we are long AMZN, GOOGL, AAPL, MSFT, CMCSA.
