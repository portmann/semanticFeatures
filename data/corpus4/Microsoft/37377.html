ETF Hub Apr 23 2015, 16:54 ET | About: Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor In spite of 2% Y/Y drops in Windows volume license and Office commercial sales - the latter is hurt by the shift to Office 365 subscriptions from up-front licenses, which pushes out revenue recognition - Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Commercial revenue rose 5% Y/Y in FQ3 to $12.8B, even with FQ2's pace and helping revenue/EPS beat estimates. A 12% increase in server product/services revenue (improved from FQ2's 9% ) contributed, as did a 106% increase in commercial cloud revenue (nearly even with FQ2's 114%). As expected, Windows OEM license revenue (hurt by both weak PC sales and discounts for smaller/cheaper devices) was soft: OEM Pro revenue fell 19% and non-Pro revenue 26%. Also as expected: Forex took a toll on sales. GAAP revenue growth (boosted by the Nokia deal) was 9% Y/Y in constant currency vs. 6% in actual dollars. Surface revenue rose 44% to $713M. Phone hardware revenue totaled $1.4B, with 8.6M Lumias sold (10.5M were sold in seasonally strong FQ2). Search ad revenue rose 21% (no dollar amount is given). Commercial cloud revenue is now on a $6.3B/year run rate, up from $5.5B a quarter ago. Consumer Office 365 subs rose by 3.2M Q/Q to over 12.4M. $5.1B was spent on buybacks, giving a lift to EPS. While revenue rose 6%, gross profit (affected by high capex and a shift towards hardware and cloud revenue) rose only 1%. Microsoft ended FQ3 with $95.4B in cash/short-term investments (much of it offshore), and $29.3B in debt. ETF Performance: View ETF performance across key asset classes and investing themes
