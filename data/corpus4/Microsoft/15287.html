ETF Hub GOOG's advertising business faces new threats and has little upside in ARPU. GOOG's Android is likely losing some market share to AAPL, which could have a domino effect. Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) is still an unquestioned king in Silicon Valley, but over the last year or so there has been several reasons to believe it is losing its luster. Specifically, there are five reasons I wouldn't own it. The biggest concern I have is regarding Google's biggest business, its near $60 billion a year advertising business. Google has an average revenue per user (ARPU) well over $45 wheras Facebook's (NASDAQ: FB ) is just $9 in North America and Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) and LinkedIn's (NYSE: LNKD ) is far less than that. This naturally creates the question of how much upside remains for Google's advertising business when competitors are charging so much less with very effective advertising products. Furthermore, Google might soon face new competition. The Wall Street Journal reported (WSJ registration required at link) last August that Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ) is prepping an advertising platform for both its own site and third-party sites. In the past, Amazon.com had used Google to sponsor ads on its site, to the tune of $1 billion worth of ads last year. Thus, Google will lose that business and gain a new competitor if Amazon.com enters the space. However, for the time being Facebook poses a much greater threat to Google. Just recently Facebook announced the launch of a mobile ad exchange that lets publishers sell video and display ads based on Facebook's data. This is directly aimed at Google's DoubleClick ad service, and its broader advertising empire as Facebook aims to grab a piece of the advertising market excluding its own platform. In other words, Google now faces real competition in its most important business by a company that has just as much data and as big of a presence as it does. That's scary for Google longs, creating a competitive environment where it is tough to imagine Google ARPU rising too much in the future, if not falling. According to IDC , Google's Android operating system controlled over 76% of the global smartphone market at the end of last year. However, after several years of Android growing its market share in mobile, Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPhone 6 and 6 Plus has begun to reverse the trend. This is mostly due to the obsession that global smartphone users have for phablets, as Apple now has a device in the phablet space. In regards to the effect that Apple is having on Android, Cowen recently performed a large study on iPhone 6 and 6 Plus owners in the U.S., China and Japan. What it found is that 20% of owners were new to iOS, and well over 80% of that 20% were coming from Android. Perhaps even more alarming is that Cowen also surveyed consumers who plan to purchase an iPhone 6, 6 Plus over the next 12 months. More than 35% of the participants plan to replace their Android with an iPhone during this 12-month span. This study supports the theory that Android is losing market share to Apple, although we won't know to what degree until first quarter data is announced next month. What's really alarming about Apple's better-than-expected performance with the iPhone is that Android put its best foot forward to combat the demand for iOS products. Not only did Google release a new Nexus phone and tablet, but LG and Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) both released new phones near Apple's launch of the iPhone. Yet, for Samsung in particular, sales last year were still flat versus 2013. That said, there are legitimate indications that Google is beginning to lose its magic touch with Android, even with app developers. Most recently, Facebook unveiled Messenger Platform at its f8 conference, and despite Android being the more dominant operating system globally, Messenger Platform is currently only compatible with iOS. That's kind of a slap to the face of Google by a company that essentially dominates applications across both Android and iOS. As a result, if developers start to sway against Android due to the innovations and flexibility of iOS for developers, and Android begins to lose global market share, Google investors must worry about Play's revenue outlook. Google's Other revenue, which includes Android, Nexus, and cloud services created almost $2 billion of the company's $14.5 billion during the fourth quarter, growing 19% year-over-year. Due to Android's market share, Google Play has 60% more app downloads per quarter than Apple according to App Annie. However, App Annie also estimates that the App Store created 70% more revenue than Google Play last year, mainly because engagement is higher on iPhones, and therefore iOS devices consume far more data than Android devices. In other words, iPhone users spend more time on their apps than Android users. As a result, it is crucial for Google to maintain its dominance in the mobile world, as Google Play is its only monetization of Android. Given the trends that are weighing in iOS' favor, I am particularly worried that Google Play revenue could start to weigh on Google's Other business. Lastly, Google's YouTube faces a much more competitive world than in years past, and specifically Facebook has become a legitimate threat. YouTube has been given a valuation of up to $40 billion by several analysts, meaning it is very important to Google's market capitalization, yet the company doesn't even report financial information for YouTube. As a result, analysts are left to speculate as to just how successful YouTube is as a platform. While several analysts figure that YouTube is responsible for over 10% of Google's total ad revenue, The Information reported last year that YouTube's expected ad revenue growth rate of 50% was actually closer to 25%, and that Google's gross ad revenue from YouTube was just $1.5 billion. One reason that YouTube might be experiencing some growing pains is because of increased competition; for the first time ever YouTube's share of video uploads on Facebook declined last year. Unfortunately, no one knows for sure, but if in fact YouTube begun to experience some growth issues last year it is likely because platforms such as Netflix continue to grow while media companies like CNBC and ESPN emphasize their own streaming content -- social media platforms Facebook and Twitter also put some skin in the video game. Furthermore, Facebook has become a meaningful presence in video, having over three billion video views daily on its platform, most of which are very similar to the content viewed on YouTube. That's why Facebook's recently announced embeded videos could be a big problem for YouTube. Currently, Google still capitalizes on the billions of views it gains outside of the YouTube platform due to the sharing of videos. Up until now, Facebook's videos were only available on its own platform, but moving forward Facebook will allow the sharing of its video content to other sites, just like YouTube. So, if in fact YouTube's growth is slowing, this could be yet another reason to worry. With all things considered, there are major red flags and concerns for every one of Google's primary businesses. What makes this so bad is that for the first time, it is hard to see where Google's next big thing will come from. Certainly, Google has the broadband service Fiber, but can't afford to outspend AT&T (NYSE: T ) to the tune of $100 billion to offer services throughout the entire country. Furthermore, Google remains a distant fourth place behind Amazon.com, Microsoft, and IBM in cloud infrastructure services, an industry where top-line growth has been pressured due to widespread discounting within the space. Also, the company's initiatives with payments went nowhere, Glass has been a disappointment, and excitement stemming from self-driving cars, its infamous "barge", and Android Wear has all but fizzled away. As a result, I find it increasingly difficult to justify a valuation north of 20x forward earnings for Google, or 33x free cash flow. This is especially true when big tech companies that pay dividends and buyback stock like Apple and Qualcomm are trading at just 13x next year's earnings. In other words, Google is just too expensive given all of the risk, and that's ultimately the deciding factor for why I would not buy the stock at any point in the near future.
