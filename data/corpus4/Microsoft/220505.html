How Microsoft Trumped Apple And Why It Will Continue To Do So - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft is on the cusp of years of profitable growth. While Apple's future is cloudy, Microsoft's future is clear and cloud based. Microsoft was late into mobile and pretty well missed the boat. That gave Apple free reign on the space with only Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) as serious competition - Samsung in devices and Google in operating systems. Apple made a lot of money harvesting its popular iPhone at nosebleed prices. While it did so, Samsung took the lead in terms of market share in smartphones and Google's Android OS became the most used operating system with over 80% market share. By mid-2015, Apple's global share of smartphone shipments had fallen to under 13% while Android devices led by Samsung held over 80%. Not so for Microsoft. Under the leadership of Satya Nadella Microsoft has transformed itself into a cloud-based software company with a subscription model for most of its offerings. Microsoft has advanced its operating system to support all form factors with Windows 10 making the job of developing for Microsoft-based platforms a breeze for developers. And Microsoft has expanded its hardware offering to include "best in class" tablets and smartphones with the launches of Surface Pro 4, Surface Book and the Lumia 950 and 950 XL devices. Over time, I expect Microsoft to repeat its historic pattern of embrace and extend (and ultimately extinguish) competition from iOS and Android. The first solid evidence of this long-standing Microsoft approach to its rivals appeared when Microsoft showed off versions of Office and Outlook designed to work on iOS and Android devices. Those products were not scaled down versions inferior to the Windows versions, but full bodied and effective programs that iOS and Android users would find every bit as powerful as their Windows counterparts. The Office for iPad application quickly ran to the top of the App Store download list after its 2014 introduction. In one year, over 100 million users of iOS and Android downloaded Microsoft Office for their devices. That trend is likely to continue. At the same time, Microsoft is taking steps to make it easier for developers to port their iOS and Android applications to run on Windows 10 devices. Microsoft's strategy is as diabolical as it is brilliant. Microsoft knows the key to success in software is to make users want Microsoft functionality and make it easy for developers to provide it regardless of OS or platform. Once hundreds of millions (or even billions in the case of Office) users value the functionality of Microsoft software suites, and with barriers to developing or "porting" applications to run on Windows 10 as low as possible, developers will follow and "water will run downhill" with both users and developers putting Microsoft at the top of their opportunity list. In that regard, Microsoft devices will gradually gain traction. Microsoft announced that 110 million devices are already using Windows 10 and that its commercial cloud business has reached more than $8 billion in annual revenues. Microsoft's fast growing cloud platforms will emerge as enormous and highly profitable businesses that compete with Google and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), not Apple. Even in mobile, Microsoft seems to be determined to advance. I can't wait to get my hands on a Lumia 950XL and start to use it not only as my smartphone but also as a desktop replacement, taking advantage of the wireless connectivity to monitor, keyboard and mouse to have only one device meet my mobile and desktop needs. In the near term, Apple is projecting anemic growth for the December quarter while Microsoft is projecting a slight decline as it shifts to a subscription model. Microsoft's apparent revenue softness disguises robust growth in key commercial cloud segments and the rapid rise of subscription revenues which will I expect will overtake traditional revenue recognition in the next two or three years. The snapshot suggests Apple is outperforming Microsoft, but the reality is the reverse. In my opinion, Apple is heading into slow growth and perhaps even a decline in both revenues and profits while Microsoft is on the cusp of a solid breakout to the upside on all fronts. It was no surprise to me that MSFT outperformed AAPL for the past few years. I believe that trend will continue and even accelerate in 2016. I will maintain my short position in AAPL and selectively add MSFT on any dips. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
