Among those complaints: software that started downloading itself without provocation , and, most recently, a pop-up window with a red “X” — the kind that one might think from experience would close a window — that initiated the upgrade, confusing users. The new pop-up window has three options: Upgrade now, Choose time, and Decline free offer, and the red “X” will really be a red “X” and will close that window from now on, Microsoft says. “Since we introduced a new upgrade experience for Windows 10, we’ve received feedback that some of our valued customers found it confusing,” Windows chief Terry Myerson said in a statement to The Verge . “We’ve been working hard to incorporate their feedback and this week, we’ll roll out a new upgrade experience with clear options to upgrade now, schedule a time, or decline the free offer.” Itâ€™s all part of Microsoftâ€™s final push to get Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 users to upgrade for free by July 29. After that, the expected upgrade fee will be $119.
