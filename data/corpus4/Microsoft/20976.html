Microsoft Challenges Apple With $499 Surface 3 - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Third timeâ€™s the charm. The new fanless Microsoft Surface 3 might finally convince consumers to buy it instead of the iPad Air or MacBook Air. The more affordable $499 Surface 3 is ideal for enterprise users, educators, and graphic artists. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) has intensified its campaign to steal customers away from Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPad Air 2 and MacBook Air. The new $499 Surface 3 2-in-1 is a Windows 8.1 tablet (upgradeable to Windows 10) that directly competes with the latest $499 iPad Air 2. Microsoft's decision to offer a cheaper Surface could aggravate the declining sales of iPads. Panos Panay, Microsoft's vice-president for Surface products, made it clear in a blog post that the cheaper Surface 3 is also a laptop replacement for office workers. Like the $799 Surface Pro, the $499 Surface 3 could also compete with the $1,000+ MacBooks. The Surface 3 is a bargain buy for IT managers looking to upgrade their corporate mobile computers. Just look at the specs chart of this $499 tablet/notebook and you will understand why I believe Microsoft has a future bestseller in the Surface 3. The $499 Surface 3 base model has more storage and bigger display than the $499 iPad Air 2 . It comes with 1TB free cloud storage and 1 year Office 365 subscription. The enterprise-centric Surface 3 Pro was a blockbuster hit last year. Panos now wants budget-constrained colleges and small companies to try the $499 Surface 3 as their go-to mobile productivity tool. Microsoft has already contracted to sell Surface 3 units to the University of Phoenix, Emirates Airlines, BASF, and Prada. Panos believes that the Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) Core i5 compute power of the Surface Pro 3 is great but it's too powerful for some daily office tasks. The $499 Surface 3 is therefore the logical more cost effective solution to regular mobile office work. The 10.8-inch display of the Surface 3 is smaller than the Surface Pro 3's 12-inch screen. However, the Surface 3's 1920 x 1280 screen should be comfortable enough for regular Microsoft Office usage, email composition, and web browsing. The Surface 3 is a tablet that can function as a fanless and lightweight office laptop. Those people who hated the noisy fan of the Core i7-powered Surface Pro 3 will love the quiet productivity time with the $499 Surface 3. Like the new MacBook Air 2015, the Surface 3 uses a low-power Intel SoC that doesn't need a cooling fan. The 14-nanometer 64-bit quad-core 1.6 GHz (can go up to 2.4 GHz with Burst Technology) Intel Atom X7-Z8700 inside the $499 Surface 3 boasts a Scenario Design Power of only 2 Watts. Intel's advancement in SoC design now made it possible for Microsoft to come up with a full Windows 8.1 tablet/notebook that is fanless and yet powerful enough to run Adobe's (NASDAQ: ADBE ) Photoshop CC. A $499 Surface 3 with only 2GB of RAM just got tested yesterday and it has excellent GeekBench 3 benchmark scores . The $599 version of the Surface 3 with 4GB of RAM would be perfect for digital illustrators and graphic artists. The Atom X7 may not be powerful enough to work with advanced 3D modeling software like Autodesk's (NASDAQ: ADSK ) Maya but I firmly believe it can run 2D-only Adobe Creative Cloud CC software. The 4GB RAM version would help address the heavy RAM requirements of Adobe's software. The Surface 3's stylus is also similar to the Surface Pro 3's N-trig pen . Consequently, price-sensitive graphic designers can buy the $599 Surface 3 and use it for digital illustrations with ease . The $499 version with 2GB of RAM is also sufficient for other graphic and illustration software that competes with Adobe's products. Based on hands-on experience, Inkscape is a free and powerful alternative to Adobe Illustrator CC that runs well even on my old 1GB RAM-equipped Acer Aspire One Netbook. I can only testify that Xara Designer X Pro also works well on 2GB RAM computers. My point now is that Microsoft can exert more pressure on Apple's iPad business by also coming up with a $399 Surface 3 with just 2GB of cheaper LPDDR3 RAM, 32GB of storage, and a smaller 9.8-inch display. Targeting the $399 iPad product extends the total addressable market of the Surface 3. A $399 Surface 3 becomes even attractive to budget-conscious design and advertising students. Positioning the Surface 3 for the education market is very important. Microsoft's Windows PC sales to U.S. K-12 education market is under assault from Google's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) cheap Chromebooks. The last time I checked there's no consumer-centric Chromebook or iPad that can run industry-standard Adobe or Autodesk software. Microsoft could benefit if it also expands its focus on U.S. colleges and technical training schools. The Surface 3 has the potential to attract buyers from the enterprise, education, institutional, and creative industries. Yes, Apple sells more iPads than Microsoft does with its Surface tablets. However, let us not forget that no iPad can play the latest PC games. Gamers are the other highly desirable target customers for a $499 Surface 3. The Gen8 GPU of the Atom x7-Z8700 offers vast improvement in 3D gaming performance. DoTA 2 and League of Legends players who would like to play while laying down on their bed would appreciate the improved GPU of the Surface 3. The Gen8 Intel HD graphics promises 50% 3DMark Ice Storm performance than last year's Atom Z3795. The Asus ( OTC:ASUUY ) Transformer T200 has 2GB of RAM and has the old Atom Z3795 (and Gen7 HD graphics) - and it already delivers crisp Borderlands 2 gameplay. The 10.8-inch display of the Surface 3 makes it great for multiplayer online MOBA games like DoTA 2. My point is that the cheaper Surface 3 has a bigger total addressable market than the $799 Surface Pro 3. It also has a bigger market than the Apple iPad Air 2 and Macbook Air. This fact is a compelling reason to bear the negative scores that I Know First's predictive algorithm gave to MSFT. The near term 30-day and 90-day forecast for MSFT says the stock is highly probable to suffer more downtrend. The forecast machines of I Know First are also in line with the negative long-term technical indicators of MSFT. I humbly suggest that Seeking Alpha users wait for the bears to make MSFT cheaper before adding it to their portfolio. Microsoft is under a new leader that knows how to win mobile and cloud computing. Source: Microsoft Challenges Apple With $499 Surface 3 Disclosure: The author is long MSFT, INTC, AAPL.
