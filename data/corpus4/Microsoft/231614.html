Apple: Tag Heuer's Insincere Flattery - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Tag Heuer has released a $1,500 Android Wear watch. The Tag Heuer's smartwatch demonstrates how poorly it understands Apple. Tag Heuer's just released Carrera Connected is not so much a smart watch as it is the Swiss watch industry's caricature of a smart watch. The Connected is too bulky, too limited and way too expensive compared to Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Watch. But it has the Tag Heuer brand slathered all over it. If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, this is flattery of an entirely different and insincere form. The Carrera Connected is the product of the partnership of Tag Heuer, a division of luxury goods maker LVMH ( OTCPK:LVMHF ), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ). That must have been an interesting collaboration. Like oil and water, the exclusive luxury goods pedigree of LVMH could not have mixed easily with the commodity device approach of Intel and Google. The result is an undistinguished commodity Android Wear watch with just the thinnest sheen of Tag Heuer luxury floating on the surface. The Connected is 12.8 mm thick and lacks the heart rate sensor common in smart watches, a $1,500 commodity Android device masquerading as a luxury mechanical watch: The above picture is from the AppleInsider forum . The Connected represents a curious mixture of desperation to be like Apple, mixed with contempt for Apple. The Swiss watch industry is clearly desperate for an answer to Apple Watch, but Tag Heuer doesn't have anything like the expertise to engineer both a smart watch operating system and the processor to go with it as Apple does. So, under the suasion of Google and Intel, Tag fell back on the commodity device paradigm. Apparently, Tag Heuer thought that this would be good enough to compete with Apple. This is where their fundamental contempt for Apple came into play. This is a contempt I hear echoed in countless bearish analyses of Apple. To the bears, Apple is simply a brand, and the secret of Apple's success is simply brand marketing. So, in "imitation" of Apple, Tag makes sure that its name or logo appears in four different places on the strap, the crown, the bezel, and the LCD watch face itself. The importance that Tag attached to this can be seen in an early concept drawing published by Bloomberg . Perhaps the most insincere aspect of the Carrera Connected is the trade-in deal being offered by Tag Heuer. According to the Bloomberg report, After two years, a Connected Watch owner can bring the watch into a TAG Heuer retailer, trade it in with an additional $1,500, and receive a mechanical TAG Heuer watch in return. Tag is saying to consumers that when this silly smart watch fad blows over in a couple of years, Tag will graciously allow its customers to upgrade to a real watch for a modest additional sum. If only all of Apple's competitors were this stupid. OK, it's not so much stupidity as ignorance, an ignorance that Apple's competitors often take years to overcome after Apple disrupts their market. It took years for Apple's competitors to wise up in the case of iPhone, and apparently it will take years for Apple Watch as well. From the beginning, the Swiss watch industry has been in denial about Apple Watch. Said Jean-Claude Biver , president of LVMH, Nick Hayek , the CEO of Swatch is reported to have said: Isn't that what was said about iPhone? As I recently recounted in Apple Watch: Putting A Dent In The Swiss Watch Industry , Apple Watch does seem to have put the Swiss into crisis mode. Swatch also is developing its own smart watch which will have payment capability but no health monitoring due to Hayek's professed privacy concerns . Market research firm Canalys recently announced its conclusion (on November 4) that Apple had shipped a total of 7 million smart watches since launch. Given that as of the September quarter, cumulative watch sales could have been as high as 6 million, the Canalys number probably isn't too far off. The important takeaway from the Canalys report was that Apple's Watch volume was far greater than competing watches of comparable price. Canalys stated that Apple was the only smart watch vendor to ship more than 300,000 units in calendar Q3. My estimate for the quarter is in the range of 3-3.9 million units. Based on the decline in sales reported by the Swiss watch industry, the sorry state of initial competing products such as the Carrera Connected, it's becoming clear that Apple has another successfully disruptive product on its hands. As I stated in my previous article on Apple Watch, the annual unit sales of electronic watches of 770 million in 2014 represent a huge addressable market for smart watches. I foresee all electronic watches becoming smart watches eventually. But not all of these will be Apple Watches. The majority will be low-cost plastic bands such as the Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Band 2. Apple will naturally migrate to the premium end of the market with a market share of probably 10-15% for annual unit sales at the high end of the range of about 100 million units. The biggest uncertainty is how long it takes to get to that point. By the end of iPhone's first year of availability, Apple reported shipping a total of 6.124 million units. In comparison Apple Watch is off to a roaring start, possibly surpassing that number in half a year. Unfortunately, the numbers are still too small to make an obvious change in revenue and earnings that will excite investors. Here, Apple investors are ill served by Apple's policy of secrecy about Watch sales. Apple should report unit sales and revenue for Watch as it does for other important Apple device categories. If Apple did that, I believe investors would get excited about the growing momentum of Watch. This would be a positive catalyst to get the stock price moving up again.
