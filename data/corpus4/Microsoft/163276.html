Microsoft Studios: An Autumn To Remember - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft Studios is overseeing Microsoft's gaming division and is accounting for roughly 10% of revenue of the whole business. Gaming is a part of a broader Microsoft strategy that was revealed by Satya Nadella and plays a crucial role in building corporation ecosystem. This yearâ€™s lineup of exclusive games would be the greatest in Xbox's history and will give Microsoft a space to maneuver in the coming holiday season. While its main competitor, Sony, pushed its major titles to the 2016-2017 season, now would be the right time to establish a stronger presence in the growing industry. Microsoft Studios is a division of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ) that oversees gaming industry. Its primary objectives are to cooperate with first and second party developers and publish their games on different platforms. At the end of July, Microsoft announced that revenues for the quarter ended June 30, 2015 were $22.2 billion, where Computing and Gaming Hardware, including Xbox and Surface, deliver nearly $2 billion in revenue. Gaming is a big deal for the corporation. At the end of June, Microsoft's CEO Satya Nadella revealed company's new mission statement, where he included the importance of uniting all its gaming-oriented initiatives. He said: We will pursue our gaming ambition as part of this broader vision for Windows and increase its appeal to consumers. We will bring together Xbox Live and our first-party gaming efforts across PC, console, mobile and new categories like HoloLens into one integrated play. A month after Satya Nadella was appointed CEO of Microsoft, he made some changes in the leadership team and chose Phil Spencer to take over all Xbox and Xbox Live operations. The first thing that Phil Spencer did was an unbundling of unpopular Kinect from Xbox 360 and Xbox One. A few months later, it bought the maker of highly popular game Minecraft, a studio called Mojang for $2.5 billion, and increased focus on gamers . As we see, from Nadella's statement, Microsoft's goal is to connect all of its users with different devices under one ecosystem. Gaming division that accounts for roughly 10% revenue of the whole business is a part of that strategy. To do this, the company did next: With the release of Windows 10, a new Xbox App was created by Microsoft, which will finally aim to knit Xbox Live users more deeply into Microsoft's newest OS. Fable Legends would be the first cross-platform game. What that means is that you can play it on your PC and your friend could be in the same session with you on Xbox One. Phil Spencer said that it's the first game of many that will have such an ability. Now you can live stream games that you are playing on Xbox One to PCs. The vice-versa option would be available soon. It seems that Xbox will soon be not just a game console, but a TV-connected Windows PC, too. And it sounds like Microsoft is hoping that its PC, tablet, and console hardware will work together to spark more interest, and more sales. Now if you think that that's not enough, and Microsoft is losing gaming business to its competitors, then look at these numbers: For the fourth quarter, total Xbox revenue grew 27% based on strong growth in consoles, Xbox Live transactions and first party games. Xbox Platform revenue increased $86 million or 10%, driven by higher volumes of consoles sold, offset in part by lower prices of Xbox Ones sold. The company sold 1.4 million consoles in the fourth quarter compared to 1.1 million consoles during the prior year. Xbox Live transactions revenue increased $205 million or 58%, reflecting increased users and revenue per user. So as we can see, the last quarter was great for the gaming division of the corporation, and the rise of consoles that were sold will only increase Microsoft's influence in the industry. And at the same time, its ecosystem will only benefit with the presence of new customers that might be interested in other company's products. New gamers will only increase the demand for the new gaming titles, and as the holiday season approaches, a new portion of customers will decide whether to buy a console from Microsoft or from its competitors. And that's where Microsoft Studios is coming in. As we already know, Microsoft Studios is overseeing and cooperating with its first and second party developers and is in charge of the publishing part of the business. Thanks to the job that those guys did, this year's lineup of exclusive games would be the greatest in Xbox's history. First, we have a launch of Gears of War Ultimate Edition for Xbox One that was released on August 25. This is a remake for the console that will feature five unreleased chapters of the campaign of the original game (that was released on Xbox 360 in 2006), and players who purchased the Ultimate Edition can participate in the multiplayer beta of Gears of War 4, which is set to be released in 2016. The development of the remake took 18 months and only selected elements like voice performance from the original game were retained. Then we have an upcoming racing video game Forza Motorsport 6. The game will include more than 450 cars, more than twice the number of cars available at launch for Forza Motorsport 5, and there will be 26 tracks, including 10 that are new to the franchise. The title already received positive feedback from a lot of people at this year's Gamescom, and is expected to be released for Xbox One on September 15. Next in line is a new Halo title called Halo 5: Guardians. This is the second game in the Reclaimer Saga and continues the story of the Master Chief. The set will feature the largest ensemble cast of characters in any Halo game yet, with both new and returning characters. The game is expected to be released for Xbox One on October 27, and it already received a warm welcome from the public. Rise of the Tomb Raider is an upcoming action-adventure video game that will be released exclusively on Xbox 360 and Xbox One on November 13. The version for PlayStation 4 will be available for sale only in fourth quarter of 2016, so this would be an advantage for Microsoft console. In the game, players control Lara Croft through various environments, battling enemies, and completing puzzle platforming sections, while using improvised weapons and gadgets in order to progress through the story. Other two titles on the Microsoft Studios lineup are Fable Legends and Below. Both are expected to be released exclusively on Windows platform and Xbox Live service for Xbox One at the fourth quarter of 2015. The first game is based around four heroes and a villain. During each quest, the four hero characters must use teamwork to succeed in their objectives, while the villain player opposes them with an army of creatures. The second is an adventure game viewed from a top-down perspective. It's about exploration, though that goal is contingent upon the character's survival and is expected to include a multiplayer mode. Video gaming market is a $91.5 billion industry, which will reach $107 billion in 2017. Main Microsoft competitors in this field are Sony (NYSE: SNY ) and Nintendo ( OTCPK:NTDOY ) ( OTCPK:NTDOF ). And the picture currently looks like this: Microsoft is still lagging behind Sony to control even 1/3 of the worldwide video gaming market. But it slowly narrows the gap. This holiday season would be important for the corporation because there would be the real possibility to take some chunk of market share from its competitors, especially from Sony. Besides the fact that this year's lineup of games would be the greatest in Xbox history, Microsoft should use Sony's weakness to acquire new customers. And the reason for that is that Sony pushed its major titles to 2016-2017, which gives Microsoft a space to maneuver by bundling different kind of games to console all type of consumers and have a more flexible discount programs. As we can see, Microsoft's gaming division accounts for roughly 10% of revenue of the whole business. Right now, there are more than 48 million active Xbox Live users. And it's important for the corporation in a way that it connects its Xbox gamers with all the other users that are using different kind of company's products and at the same time reaches a broader audience and increases its influence there. With the great lineup of exclusive games for Xbox platforms and a weakness of Sony's portfolio of IPs this year, Microsoft should win the coming holiday season and establish a stronger presence in the growing industry that will increase the shareholder value.
