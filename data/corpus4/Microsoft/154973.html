What Apple Watch? Evaluating Fitbit After Q2 - Fitbit, Inc. (NYSE:FIT) | Seeking Alpha Fitbit's sales were not hurt by the release of the Apple Watch in Q2. Not only did Fitbit's sales rise, but their margins remained high and they entered corporate wellness agreements with Geico, Transunion and other companies. Fitbit has room to expand in the fitness-tracking space and their strong fundamentals provide an opportunity to enter new markets. Now that Fitbit (NYSE: FIT ) has posted their first earnings report, and existed alongside the Apple Watch (and other new competitors) for a quarter, it's a good time to reassess their performance and potential. The stock already has rewarded early investors since I issued a buy call two months ago at $30.96. But is Fitbit still a good purchase? And perhaps most importantly, where will future growth come from? First, let's examine the market trends. Just before Fitbit's IPO in May I wrote that investors shouldn't worry about the Apple Watch because Fitbit and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) weren't competing over the same market . Instead, I wrote that the wearable industry was going to segment into three distinct, broad categories. Here's how I broke it down: 2. Smart clothing that relays muscle-activation data and breathing patterns 3. Multi-purpose devices such as the Apple Watch, which are primarily smartphone extensions While many commentators assumed the Apple Watch would eat into Fitbit's market share, this has not been the case. This isn't because the Apple Watch is a poor product, but because it's targeted at a different market. Fitbit is focused exclusively on the fitness and personal health space, while the Apple Watch is a multipurpose device and a smartphone extension. Apple didn't release sales numbers for the Apple Watch in their Q2 report, but based on the $1 billion revenue growth in their "other" segment, most analysts peg the number at somewhere around 2 million . Fitbit meanwhile sold 4.5 million fitness devices, up from 1.7 million year-over-year, and remained the default leader in the fitness-tracking category. In other words, the Apple Watch is not "encroaching" on Fitbit's market. In fact, there's not even evidence to support the idea that potential Fitbit customers are delaying their purchases in order to try out the Apple Watch or other smartwatches. This is probably due to Fitbit's lower price point (which falls squarely in the "impulse buy" range) and different use-cases. What market is the Apple Watch encroaching on? Traditional watches . Watch sales declined 14% in June (the largest drop since 2008), although the Apple Watch is likely not the sole reason for this. This does further reinforce the separate-market theory though - smartwatches may be seen as a replacement for traditional timepieces but have not established themselves as attractive fitness tracking devices. While many companies (especially in consumer goods) have to sacrifice margins while they scale their products, Fitbit has managed to expand while keeping margins high. They slipped just 4% year-over-year, from 51% to 47%. Given that revenue rose from $113.5 million to $400.4 million over the same period, this should not be cause for concern. Over the first six months of 2015, gross margin actually edged up to 48% from 46% in the same period the year before. For Fitbit to be able to maintain such margins in the face of increased competition from companies including Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Garmin (NASDAQ: GRMN ) demonstrates their success in building a loyal customer base and creating a moat around their offerings. Their growing online community and popular brand are two components of this. Brand awareness is a large factor among consumers and among corporations. As companies expand (or start) corporate wellness programs, name recognition will play a role in securing such partnerships. During Q2, Fitbit continued their streak of corporate success, entering into agreements with Geico, Quicken Loans and Transunion, among others. These agreements not only boost their device sales but also help expand their brand among consumers through word-of-mouth advertising and increased exposure. Given their solid market position and rising sales, it's encouraging to see that Fitbit has continued to invest in R&D. Their research and development expenses rose by 258%, from 11.8 million to 30.5 million. General and administrative, meanwhile, roughly doubled from $7.4 million to $14.6 million. Upping their expense on R&D, while keeping general and administrative under control (revenue rose by 350% in the same period) demonstrates a focused and forward-looking management team. As to their future, there's plenty of territory left to exploit in the dedicated fitness-tracking space. Fitbit's upcoming pipeline will no doubt reflect that. Perhaps more importantly, Fitbit's solid fundamentals provide them with an opportunity to enter new markets. Fitbit ended Q2 with $461 million in cash, up from $195 million year-over-year. Cash assets give companies cushion to explore new strategies and/or markets - or withstand downturns. In this case, Fitbit should pursue the dedicated health-device market. This is a large, underserved market right now due to the complexity of medical device regulations (which is itself worth an entire article) and the time required to take a product to market. However, there also are huge opportunities for companies that enter this market early. Fitbit's hardware design prowess could give them a huge advantage in designing usable, intuitive health devices for proactive treatment of neurological conditions, diabetes or other chronic illnesses. Fitbit remains in a strong position and has faced little competition from the Apple Watch or other multipurpose smartwatches. Despite a growing number of competitors, Fitbit's sales rose by over 350% year-over-year, while margins remained solid. Their continued investment in research and development - and the largely untapped opportunity presented by dedicated health-devices - gives Fitbit continued room for expansion.
