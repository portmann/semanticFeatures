Intel: Inventec Confirmed It Is Making The Xiaomi Linux Laptop - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha The rumors are true, Xiaomi is expanding to notebook computers. Inventecâ€™s chairman confirmed his company is assembling custom Linux laptops for Xiaomi. I previously wrote about the rumors that Xiaomi was branching out to selling notebook computers. The previous gossip was Xiaomi will use an Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) x86 processor to power its custom Linux copycat version of the Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) MacBook Air. Well, Inventec Corp, the Original Design Manufacturer (ODM) from Taiwan, confirmed this rumor of a Xiaomi laptop. Richard Lee, Chairman of Inventec, made this official confirmation via Taipei Times three days ago. While Mr. Lee did not specifically confirm that Inventec is using Intel processors for the Xiaomi computers, he did say that commercial launch would commence as early as 1st quarter of next year. I opine that Inventec will most likely use an Intel CPU simply because Xiaomi is trying hard to copy the Intel-using MacBook. There is no official image of the final laptop design. However, we can just remove the MacBook Air emblem (and put Mi or MiBook Air instead) from Apple's laptop to get an idea of what the Xiaomi Linux laptop could look like. Since 2006, Apple found it prudent to consistently ignore the x86 processors from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ). Consequently, its imitator Xiaomi is also unlikely to use them in its first laptop product. Intel's huge R&D spending has made its x86 CPUs far more advanced than AMD's best processors. Inventec Appliance Corp. is designing/assembling the Xiaomi Linux laptop in its China factory. Along with Foxconn, Inventec is one of the top assemblers for Intel-powered notebook computers in China. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) also hired Inventec to help Lenovo (OTCPK: LNVGY ) and Acer come up with low-cost sub $250 Windows 10 notebooks using Intel Atom Bay Trail-T processors. There is therefore great probability that Inventec will also use a CPU from Intel for Xiaomi's first laptop computer. The decision to use Linux is easily explained by the fact that Microsoft will never allow its proprietary Windows 10 OS to be customized by Xiaomi. Xiaomi needs an open-source OS like Linux so it could modify it to look like Mac OS X. This is how Xiaomi had its initial success as a smartphone vendor. It modified Android OS with MIUI to look like iOS so it complements the iPhone-like design aesthetics of its sub-$350 Android phones. There is a huge business opportunity in exploiting the Chinese fans of Apple that cannot afford the luxury pricing of iPhones and MacBooks. The blockbuster success of the iPhone 6 in China does not overshadow the fact that Xiaomi remains the top-selling vendor of smartphones in that country. Since Apple is unable to stop the copycat designs of Xiaomi, an Intel-powered sub-$500 MacBook clone could attract the interest of millions of Chinese customers who still cannot afford $1,000 MacBooks. If the rumors are true, Inventec/Xiaomi will allegedly use the energy-efficient (2W Scenario Design Power) Atom x7-Z8700 SoC. The Atom x7-8700 is a $35/tray Intel processor that is already found inside the fanless but powerful $499 Microsoft Surface 3 tablet/notebook. Creative professionals already proved that an Atom x7-8700 could run CPU/RAM-heavy software like Photoshop CC and Illustrator CC . The GeekBench 3 chart below already revealed that the Intel Atom x7-Z8700 excels on Windows and Android (a derivative of Linux) platforms. It's safe to presume that it will also have exemplary CPU benchmark scores on a Xiaomi Linux laptop. The potential economic benefits from Xiaomi selling a cheaper clone of the Macbook Air is easy to comprehend. I opine that Xiaomi will not cannibalize the sales of the original big-ticket Apple MacBook products. Instead, it will only create an opportunity to monetize the budget-constrained Apple fans that cannot afford the real thing. The bigger benefits will come once Xiaomi starts selling higher-end versions with more expensive Core M or Core i5 processors inside its laptops. The continuing refusal of Apple to sell touchscreen-equipped MacBooks might be an exploitable blunder. Xiaomi can create a still-cheaper $700 clone of the MacBook Air and make it really appealing by giving it a touchscreen display. In spite of the fact that Mac OS X Yosemite already supports touchscreen displays, Apple has yet to release a touchscreen-equipped Mac computer. Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ), an early investor in Xiaomi, still enjoys great benefits from Xiaomi's success as a vendor of iPhone-like Android phones. Xiaomi uses Snapdragons and MediaTek processors for its smartphones. On the other hand, Inventec's confirmation of a laptop from Xiaomi should give Intel an opportunity to ride on that Chinese company's ambitious expansion plans. Like I said before, Xiaomi can get away with copycat designs of luxury Apple products. Xiaomi will find millions of eager buyers for them. I won't be surprised if Xiaomi suddenly joins rises as one of the top notebook PC vendors by end of 2016. Xiaomi is now a global brand that sells affordable but very high-quality products. It makes up for its razon-thin margins by pre-installing its own app store and premium subscription only services. Intel therefore has a future tailwind in Xiaomi's diversification as a PC vendor. Xiaomi's future support of x86 processors fortifies my position that Intel is a Buy-and-Hold-Forever bet for value-minded investors. The Discounted Cash Flow-heavy analysis of X-Fin also still gives a positive long-term valuation for Intel even at a mere 1% initial annual revenue growth rate calculation.
