Verizon Set To Buy Yahoo For $5 Billion | Zero Hedge While gold's new bull run seems to be currently taking a breather, many analysts feel that there is still plenty of steam left in this rally. by Phoenix Capital... - Jul 21, 2016 9:52 AM The BOJ admitted in June helicopter money is not on the agenda. Amazingly this is news today after the market has rallied on hope that helicopter money is about to be unveiled. It appears that after years of attempts to quietly, then not so quietly sell itself, the increasingly troubled former internet portal giant may have finally found the "greatest fool" thanks to Verizon. According to Bloomberg, Verizon is the lead bidder for Yahoo with a total consideration of about $5 billion, and an announcement may come in the next few days. Verizon Communications Inc. is nearing a deal to buy Yahoo! Inc., beating out rival bidders, people familiar with the matter said. The companies may be ready to announce the deal in the coming days, the people said, asking not to be named because the deliberations are private. The two companies are in one-on-one discussions, one of the people said. The deal hasnâ€™t been finalized and may still fall apart, they said. A representative for Verizon declined to comment. A representative for Sunnyvale, California-based Yahoo couldnâ€™t immediately be reached outside of regular business hours. What is curious is that Bloomberg adds the deal will exclude what is arguably Yahoo's most valuable asset: its patents. Shortly after the final deal terms are known, we will try to calculated what the value added of Marissa Meyer, excluding the Alibaba stake of course, to Yahoo stakeholders has been in the 4 years since she took over.

Mama always told me, just because I can do something doesn't mean I should. Are you listening to your mother Verizon? junction GunnerySgtHartman Jul 22, 2016 9:29 AM From her past track record of gross incompetence and self-serving, this Verizon deal engineered by Marissa Meyer will be disastrous for Yahoo stakeholders.  The only plus will be if, somehow, all the Yahoo board of directors get fired for rubber stamping Meyer's running in place while Yahoo self destructs.  Meyer couldn't even get the IRS to give Yahoo a favorable tax ruling on unloading Yahoo's stake in Ali Baba, usually a pretty easy matter: toss a big bundle of cash to the Clinton Foundation and some Senators and you are home free.  dark pools of soros Jul 22, 2016 9:11 AM DeadFred dark pools of soros Jul 22, 2016 9:14 AM SomethingSometh... Jul 22, 2016 9:12 AM This POS is still trading in the mid 30's somehow, of course its the ali baba deal supporting it, but come on! Like you said Gunny, Marissa is a real shitbag, expect to se her receive around 200 million... good luck share / bag holders. I used to be a Yahoo regular...used it every day for investing....but then they had to upgrade it and ruined it....Yahoo Financial sucks now.... buzzsaw99 youngman Jul 22, 2016 9:20 AM Wow.  $5B?  Didn't Microsoft almost buy it a few years back for over $30B?  I guess that's one terrible acquisition choice that got away from MSFT. The first thought that came to mind was when TW bought AOL which made no sense, had no symertry and was a total failure.  Swapping their landline, broadband, and Video business for a failed dotcom seems like a remarkably bad business decision.  But verizon has never had a clue how to operate without a government protected monopoly with statutorily guaranteed profits. 07-22 9:00: Canadian Consumer Price Index (Jun) M/M 129.1 vs. Exp. 128.9 (Prev.... 07-22 9:00: Canadian CPI SA (Jun) M/M 0.20% vs. Exp. 0.40% (Prev. 0.20%) 07-22 9:00: Canadian CPI Core SA (Jun) M/M 0.20% vs. Exp. 0.20% (Prev. 0.20%) 07-22 9:00: Canadian CPI (Jun) Y/Y 1.50% vs. Exp. 1.40% (Prev. 1.50%) 07-22 9:00: Canadian CPI NSA (Jun) M/M 0.20% vs. Exp. 0.10% (Prev. 0.40%) 07-22 9:00: Canadian Retail Sales (May) M/M 0.20% vs. Exp. 0.00% (Prev. 0.90%,... 07-22 9:00: Canadian CPI Core (Jun) Y/Y 2.10% vs. Exp. 2.00% (Prev. 2.10%) 07-22 9:00: Ship Finance announces amendments to long-term charger agreements...
