Apple: Weak iPhone Sales A Reason To Buy? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Analysts are worried over fiscal Q1 and Q2 iPhone sales. Yet, most analysts are keeping positive ratings and high price targets. You would think from this week's news that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) should be putting up going-out-of-business signs up everywhere. Okay, that might seem a bit dramatic, but that's the sense we are getting from a plethora of analyst notes this week regarding the iPhone. In the last few days, we are getting iPhone estimate cuts from a number of analysts on the Street, pushing shares lower. However, it seems that many are missing a number of positives in these notes, meaning the recent price weakness might provide an opportunity for those who believe in the long-term story. It would be extremely repetitive if I detailed every single analyst note we've received, so here are just a few snippets from what we've seen lately: Morgan Stanley - Sees calendar-2016 iPhone sales declining by 3%. Analyst cuts iPhone unit, EPS estimates. Reiterates Overweight, cuts PT from $152 to $143. Credit Suisse - Cuts iPhone and EPS estimates for calendar 2016. Maintains Outperform rating and $140 target. BofA Merrill - Cuts Q2 iPhone and full-year estimates. Also, reduces revenue/EPS estimates. Neutral rating, $130 PT. Analysts seem to be a little more worried with calendar Q1 2016 (Apple's fiscal Q2) than they do about the December ending fiscal Q1 period. If you look at the overall estimates , the average revenue figure for Q1 has come down by $170 million in the past few days while the average Q2 estimate is down by $820 million, and the Q2 EPS consensus has dipped by 5 cents. While nobody likes to see declining estimates, it does make it easier for the company to beat, and perhaps issue guidance not as bad as feared for Q2. Apple's shares recently peaked on December 7th at $119.86, falling below $110 earlier this week. As a result, shares have lost their 50-day moving average and fallen to their lower bollinger band, as seen below. Perhaps, this is just the usual rhetoric with AAPL this time of year. Between 2010 and 2014, the stock underperformed the PowerShares QQQ Trust ETF (NASDAQ: QQQ ) in four out of five Decembers. So far this month, Apple's shares have lost nearly 6% while the QQQ is basically flat. But let's circle back to those analyst notes for a second. Despite all of the negatives regarding iPhones, analysts have remained quite positive about Apple overall. Even with its price target cut, Morgan Stanley's target represents more than $30 of upside from Wednesday's close. Despite Bank of America having a Neutral rating on the stock, the firm sees nearly 20% of upside. Analysts see some short-term pain for the iPhone, but a number of them see things getting better over the next couple of years. Apple's iPhone upgrade program is a key reason , as analyst Gene Munster thinks 75% of US iPhone consumers will become annual upgraders by 2018. This could result in an annual tailwind of 10% to iPhone units over the next three years, or 3% overall. Munster also reminded investors that Tim Cook has warned not to rely on the supply chain estimates , and detailed the following regarding this week's warning from Dialog Semiconductor ( OTC:DLGNF ): "If Dialog's guidance was indicative of Mar-16 iPhone units, it would suggest units next quarter would be down 9% y/y compared to recent analyst iPhone cuts predicting Mar-16 down ~15%." It appears that sales of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus are not doing as well as most have originally hoped. Perhaps that is due to some consumers waiting for a 4-inch phone to be released in 2016. It could also be due to continued strong demand from last year's models of the phones that are now cheaper than the newest versions. A small screen phone (to replace the 5s) will likely be at a lower price point, which should help Apple target more growth markets around the world. Then, in late 2016, the US upgrade program should start to help reduce the replacement cycle for the iPhone, helping boost iPhone sales. IDC reported that Apple had just 13.5% global market share in calendar Q3 2015, leaving a tremendous amount of room for share growth. While I understand how important the smartphone is to Apple, investors need to remember that analysts are still looking for revenue and earnings per share growth moving forward. Apple has a dividend and a large buyback, all while trading at just 11.3 times fiscal year expected EPS. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) is expected to report a decline in revenues for its fiscal year, and yet everyone is jumping all over that stock, closing Wednesday at more than 20.3 times fiscal year expected EPS. It is logical to be concerned about the iPhone weakness, but we're not talking about AAPL like it is some high growth, huge valuation momentum stock. The company's best days are still ahead, and the stock is perhaps the cheapest in its space. It has not been a good week or so for Apple's shares, with a number of analysts out with bearish reports on the iPhone. However, the pessimism seems to be contained, because many of these analysts continue to have high price targets and buy/outperform ratings on the stock. The company's shares are now below the lowest price target on the Street, and I don't see analysts telling investors to sell on the news. In fact, I see a number of them citing things like the annual upgrade program that will help Apple in the long term. Perhaps AAPL is in for some short-term weakness, but it seems like the Street is still telling investors to be bullish in the long term.
