Report: Apple is prepping an Amazon Echo rival, opening up Siri - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha May 24 2016, 17:08 ET | About: Apple Inc. (AAPL) | By: Eric Jhonsa, SA Eye on Tech , SA News Editor The Information reports Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is working on "an Amazon Echo-like device with a speaker and microphone that people can use to turn on music, get news headlines or set a timer." It adds Siri, which will naturally power the assistant, will be opened up to third-party developers through an SDK to be unveiled at the WWDC conference (runs from June 13-17). While Siri supports some third-party services such as Yelp, Apple hasn't yet released an SDK that any developer can use to create Siri-powered services. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) rolled out an SDK last year for Alexa, the voice assistant powering its Echo speaker line, which has gradually turned into a hit and was recently updated to include cheaper hardware. The report comes a week after Google unveiled a "conversational" assistant service that builds upon Google Now, and said it would support third-party services. Microsoft competes in the voice assistant space via Cortana, and Facebook has dipped its toes into the market via M, an assistant (currently in beta) that combines AI-based and human services. Hello all of those posters who say they can do all of the Echo stuff with Siri on iPhone.  It looks like even Apple is saying that's not good enough. God, I hope not.  The market for this product consists of Amazon stockholder fanboys and uber geeks. There is no hope for profit in this market. Apple should be a leader, it has no reason to follow the ultimate imitator. Apple has never been a leader.  Apple has not built its success on leading.  Apple makes things better. Apple makes things indispensable. Those that don't understand that shouldn't be in the stock. This will be a HOT Christmas gift!  I want one and had been holding out on getting the Echo.  My friend has an Echo and it's very poor system Is there anyone not working on an Echo clone?  I'm sure I can find Arduino plans for it at this point.
