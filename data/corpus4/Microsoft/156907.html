Why salesforce May Fall From Here - salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM) | Seeking Alpha Analysts are screaming buy salesforce and taking their targets up. But CRM is still at break-even and its growth rate is slowing as numbers get bigger. salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM ) managed to break-even for its latest quarter and the people cheered. Numbers for the quarter ending in July show the software-as-a-service company broke even on revenue of $1.62 billion. That was up 24% from a year ago, and sent the stock up 2% in the after-hours after the stock market's worst day in years. Brokers and analysts put out buy ratings and took their target prices higher in response. Still, at $70.35, you're now paying seven times projected sales of $6.6 billion for the company. It's easy to argue that, given expected growth rates, that might just be 5 times next year's revenue, or that profits are just around the corner. (The company is projecting a small loss for its third quarter, ending in October). But these are the kind of projections you see in a market where greed dominates and everyone wants growth. We're not in that kind of a market right now. The saving grace in all this for CRM shareholders is that a fall in the shares could, possibly, make the company affordable for a buyer like Oracle (NYSE: ORCL ). Oracle still has a market cap of $171 billion, against $47 billion for salesforce, but drop that CRM market cap to, say, $40 billion in a general downturn and it might just become affordable, since salesforce runs primarily on Oracle hardware. But even that assumes that salesforce falls from here in order to create a take-out premium. CRM acknowledged talking to Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) about an acquisition earlier this year at $55 billion , which would have been a fat premium over even the current valuation. salesforce has an agreement to run its software on Microsoft's Azure cloud. According to the news story, CRM's CEO Marc Benioff demanded $70 billion and talks broke down. These days Microsoft is more interested in using its own numbers to dismiss salesforce's success , claiming it has the most valuable cloud by adding revenues from Office 365 to its Azure numbers. Microsoft has a funny way of defining cloud, including any software that runs in a cloud as cloud revenue when it is, in fact, software revenue. But salesforce also calls itself a "cloud" company when it's doing the same thing. If you think we're heading for a prolonged market downturn, even a correction (which still requires several hundred points more downward pressure on the NASDAQ to get 10% below its 5,218 peak), you might even want to consider a short on salesforce here. I don't play short, but the move seems obvious. A lot of the highest-flyers in the investing universe, like Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ), were hammered hard by the latest downdraft, and salesforce should not be immune to such pressure. My own view is that the market is going to bounce back at some point, and you will get a better entry point for CRM then. But the company is not going to grow to the sky, and the stock is built for a specific market attitude that is not in evidence right now.
