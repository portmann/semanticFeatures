Microsoft files antitrust suit against InterDigital - InterDigital, Inc. (NASDAQ:IDCC) | Seeking Alpha Aug 20 2015, 19:08 ET | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor Microsoft accuses InterDigital (NASDAQ: IDCC ) of violating a pledge to license its 3G/4G patents on FRAND terms , and claims the company has "engaged in an unlawful scheme to acquire and exploit monopoly power over technology necessary for companies to make 3G and 4G cellular devices." Microsoft has frequently sparred in court with InterDigital, as did Nokia before Microsoft bought the company's phone unit. In April , an ITC administrative law judge Microsoft phones infringe two InterDigital patents, and that InterDigital had fulfilled its obligation to offer to license the patents under reasonable terms. A commission ruling is expected on Aug. 28.
