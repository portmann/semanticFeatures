The New Apple iPad Pro Appears Targeted At Amateurs - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha But the iPad Pro is a long way short of a Surface Pro or Surface Book in terms of power and features. Worse, the iPad Pro runs iOS which appeals to retail users but is of little value to professional users in the enterprise space. Over time, the Intel-powered Surface and similar devices are likely to eat away at iPad and MacBook volumes with the Wintel alliance pushing Apple to the sidelines. The new Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPad Pro seems strictly for amateurs. The device is expensive, under-powered and pales in comparison to the Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Surface Pro 4 which will remain the tablet of choice for serious users. Pundits cite Apple's powerful A9 processor as a key benefit of the new iPad Pro. Apple has come a long way with its processors, with the Samsung-built A9 catching up to the Samsung Exynos 7420 on Geekbench multi-core scores. But on a laptop sized tablet, comparisons to smartphone processors are irrelevant. Serious users will compare the iPad Pro to its real competition - the Surface Pro 4 with its Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) Core processors. Apple is well aware of the power of the latest Intel processors which it includes in its popular MacBooks where Geekbench scores for the Core i7 are in the 12,000 to 16,000 range - almost triple the performance of the A9. Apple's use of the A9 processor in its iPad Pro establishes the device as a tablet, not a laptop alternative for any real work. No doubt Apple chose the A9 for its new tablet to avoid cannibalizing its MacBook offering which has been a device of choice for many computing professionals. Regrettably for Apple, an expensive and underpowered large tablet is likely to serve a small niche of users and unlikely to do much for Apple's bottom line. The Surface Pro 4 is both more powerful and cheaper when comparably equipped, with significantly more processor and storage options. Microsoft is taking direct aim at Apple with its new Surface products with the Surface Pro 4 targeting the best iPads and the Surface Book targeting MacBooks. This is a battle worth watching and a battle worth winning. Microsoft, long nolo contendre against Apple in devices, is now a formidable threat in tablets and laptops. The brilliance of Microsoft's strategy will become apparent over the next few years. Fully featured devices across all form factors running the same Windows 10 operating system and providing seamless integration of contacts, cloud storage and browser settings and history make the Microsoft suite a compelling offering while Apple can't seem to find a cohesive theme for its mixed bag of A(x) and x86 based devices running either iOS or OS X with not much compatibility across the range. This story is likely to play out much like the Apple vs. Wintel alliance of the 1990s, with Microsoft and Intel moving out front and Apple stagnating.
