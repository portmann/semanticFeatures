ETF Hub May 26 2015, 19:34 ET | About: Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor "Today, we’re announcing a Cortana application for Android phones and for iPhones which works as a companion to Cortana on your Windows 10 PC," says Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) exec Joe Belfiore. "The Cortana app can do most of the things Cortana does on your PC or on a Windows phone ... [the app] will help you complete tasks you begin on your PC wherever you are, on your phone." Reuters reported in March iOS/Android Cortana apps were on the way, and also that Microsoft is prepping a more advanced version of its personal assistant (codenamed Einstein) for Windows 10 that can read/analyze e-mail a la Google Now. Today's move is the latest in a long list of iOS/Android app launches to occur over the last two years. Also unveiled: Phone Companion, an app pre-installed with Windows 10 that helps users sync files and content between their PCs and phones; iOS, Android, and Windows Phones are supported. Meanwhile, Microsoft has added Sony, LG, and 18 other Android OEMs to the list of companies pre-installing Office, OneDrive, and Skype apps on their tablets. Pre-install deals with Samsung, Dell, and 9 others were announced in March . MSFT is on a roll, makes very strong moves. If everything goes as planned, MSFT shares will double by the end of 2016. Microsoft is starting to click on the cloud and mobile. If Windows 10 is just an acceptable success then Microsoft's in the $50's in 2016 and could break $60 a year later.  I'm still looking for the Lumia 940/940XL flagship phone running Windows 10 by Fall 2015 and the same as the Lumia or Surface 950/950XL by early 2015 with Intel Atom x3 LTE2 Inside.
