Apple Watch: The Reason For Fitbit's Crash - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Fitbit recently reported excellent results for its 2015 Q4, yet is selling off. The perception of Fitbit is being affected by the success of Apple Watch. Fitbit (NYSE: FIT ) closed out 2015 as the wearables leader in unit shipments, but Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Watch was hot on its heels. Since reporting earnings on Monday, Fitbit's share price has dropped over 20%. The reason is simple. Apple is going to do to the wearables market what it did to smartphones: grab most of the industry's profit. Market research firm IDC has confirmed that Apple moved into second place in unit shipments (with 4.1 million) in the December quarter, behind Fitbit with 8.1 million. IDC estimates cumulative unit shipments for the year at 21.0 million for Fitbit and 11.6 million for Apple Watch. As a side note, I believe IDC is a little low in their December quarter estimate for Apple. As I stated in my Apple earnings review article , I think the unit shipments for Apple Watch were higher, at about six million units. My difference with IDC is mostly about the sales profile for the last three quarters of calendar 2015. I'm in agreement with IDC that total sales were about 11 million. That Apple moved so quickly and easily into second place in Q4 undoubtedly is one of the factors weighing on the minds of investors following Fitbit's earnings release . Competing wearables from Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), as well as a host of Android Wear devices (such as the ludicrously expensive Tag Heuer Carrera Connected ) didn't make the cut of IDC's top five. This was despite Apple Watch having a relatively high entry level price point of $349 for the Watch Sport. The Apple Watch ASP is somewhere north of $400, while Fitbit's ASP is south of $100 dollars. Apple has already staked out its turf in the premium end of the wearables market. The next step is to scoop up the profits by forcing its competitors down market. This seems to be where Fitbit is inevitably headed. For 2015, Fitbit achieved an admirable gross margin of 48.5% on revenue of $1.858 billion. During its conference call, Fitbit's CFO William Zerella guided to more of the same for 2016: $2.4-$2.5 billion in revenue and gross margin of 48.5%-49%. The guidance for 2016 Q1 was a different matter, with revenue of $420-$440 million and gross margin of 46.5%. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.00-$0.02, which will probably translate into a GAAP loss. The guidance for Q1 is probably where things are headed for Fitbit for the rest of the year. Fitbit is in effect already starting the race to the bottom, and that's a slippery slope that few companies ever climb out of. Even the Fitbit Blaze , which represents a more direct competitor to Watch and a break with the company's usual fare of plastic fitness trackers, is priced at only $199.95. In the long run, companies such as Fitbit may be doomed to be marginalized by the smartphone makers. Fitbit can provide a companion app for their devices that run on iPhone or Android, but that's not really the same thing as the level of integration that Apple provides with Apple Watch, or even what's available in Android Wear. The value proposition of wearables ultimately rests on this integration. Once again, it's about the ecosystem, specifically the mobile device ecosystems of iOS and Android. A third party app doesn't really compete effectively with what the owners of the mobile device operating systems can achieve. Apple has taken this further than anyone else, to provide services to the user beyond fitness tracking or timekeeping. Apple Watch supports a host of different app notifications, as well as communications functions, even voice recognition, through being closely coupled (wirelessly) to iPhone. The fact that Apple is also building in significant standalone capability in Watch, and is likely to do more in the future just makes Apple's solution all the more compelling. Apple's clearly articulated product strategy is to push more and more functionality into ever smaller devices. Apple Watch is clearly being positioned to handle voice and video communication in future versions. For some time to come, this will still be mediated by a device such as the iPhone. But I see the iPhone evolving into a more general purpose personal computing device that people use when they want more processing power or a larger screen size. In this sense, I see the iPhone and iPad eventually merging into a spectrum of devices with a range of screen sizes and always connected capability, with Watch serving as an important user interface of first resort. Given that this is where mobile devices are heading, how much room is there for a company that only makes a wearable such as Fitbit? Not much. Apple's product strategy with Apple Watch is something Apple bears still don't get. The bears tend to focus on the fate of iPhone, but don't realize that Apple already has an iPhone successor in Watch. With Watch providing the most important communications functions, the main function of the smartphone/phablet/tablet is going to be to provide a larger viewing area (as well as provide communications relay in the background). Consumers will just choose whatever screen size device that fits their needs. As advances are achieved in processors, communications technology, and batteries, the Watch will be able to be self-sufficient in communications, so that tethering to an iPhone will not be necessary. This is still a few years (at least) in the future, but Apple's positioning of the Watch anticipates this future. When Apple Watch comes into its own, and this may take a few generations, people will realize what a bold innovative step Apple Watch has been. I remain long Apple and consider Apple a buy.
