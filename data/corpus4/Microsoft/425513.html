Apple And Didi: Redefining Transportation - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Transportation is the next big thing in technology. Apple's $1B investment in Didi Chuxing makes Apple's presence in the field official. What are the company's goals with the ~5% stake? Does the transaction point to the rumored Apple car? Transportation is the next big thing in technology. A week almost doesn't go by without a major announcement regarding a new electric vehicle, self-driving technology or ride-sharing investment. The industry is on the cusp of a massive change driven by technology and no one wants to be left behind, whether you are a traditional auto maker from Detroit, Silicon Valley blue chip, or e-commerce giant from China. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is not an exception with its rumored Project Titan electric vehicle being widely considered the worst-kept secret in Silicon Valley. The company's involvement in the auto business would make much sense. Apple looks at entering new industries to innovate and remain relevant (the ultimate success for a technology company), while its unparalleled balance sheet, core competency in designing innovative products and decades of experience building physical objects at a massive scale would put the company in a strong strategic position to redefine the car. After many Apple car rumors, leaks and clues, the company's recent $1 billion investment in Didi Chuxing (Private: DIDI ), a Chinese ride-sharing company, makes Apple's interest in the rapidly changing transportation industry official. This is a big deal for the former Apple Computer Inc. and today's "iPhone company." But what are Apple's goals with the ~5% stake in Didi? Does the transaction point to the rumored car? Or is this simply a me-too investment, following other technology companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and its stake in Uber (Private: UBER ) to take part in the growing ride-sharing market? "We are making the investment for a number of strategic reasons, including a chance to learn more about certain segments of the China market." Some analysts suggest that Apple's primary motive for the investment is to strengthen its services narrative and/or improve its relationship with the Chinese government after the forced shutdown of Apple's iBooks and iTunes Movies stores. I disagree. I think $1 billion would hardly move a needle in both areas. Instead, the best way to look at the transaction is in the context of Apple's traditional product focus. The company's M&A history shows that Apple doesn't buy companies just for the sake of additional revenue or to play politics. Each of its acquisitions has a clear goal in strengthening a current or upcoming Apple product or service. Let's explore the options that the company has in this respect: Current service. Didi's ride-sharing service uses machine learning as its critical component to predict and match demand for rides with a supply of cars. Apple's Siri voice assistant could benefit from improved machine learning. However, it could be argued that Apple has more experience in the field, and while buying a stake in a company might grant Apple access to its technology, it would not give it control and ownership - Apple's preferred way to deal with core technology for its products. Upcoming service. Apple wants to launch its own ride-sharing service and wants to learn about the business first. While this would be theoretically possible, in reality, it would be extremely costly and difficult to build scale this late in the game. Apple would have to heavily incentivize drivers and customers to use a new service with very few cars (long waiting times) and very few users (limited income for drivers). For a perspective, Uber currently loses $1B per year in China to take market share from Didi (controls 90% of the market). Upcoming product. Apple as a primarily product company and Didi as a service company want to complement each other in the transportation business. This is a partnership similar to those between Apple and IBM (NYSE: IBM )/Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ) where Apple complements its hardware with partners' software and services. I think this is the most likely scenario. Let's discuss it in more detail. Didi and its ride-sharing partners Ola (India), Grab (Southeast Asia) and Lyft (US) are involved in a fierce market battle with Uber. The best technology and product will go a long way to achieve and maintain market dominance. What Didi precisely needs? Better Machine learning. Machine learning is crucial to the company's success (Didi collects over 50TB of data per day). As per Uber's Travis Kalanick: "If you can predict where demand is going to be and you can get the supply to match to that, that's a big freaking deal." Self-driving cars. Uber has recently started testing its own self-driving cars and Didi needs to respond. The self-driving technology is crucial for the future of the ride-sharing business as it will help expand the market by lowering fares and increasing the number of cars in the network. With full level 4 autonomy, it will no longer be needed to search for and incentivize new drivers. Apple can provide Didi with all of that, having billions of cash in China (no need to repatriate it with a hefty tax), experience with machine learning for Siri, and offering Apple Maps and Apple Pay services. Most importantly, a uniquely designed, Apple-branded electric vehicle would provide added value for Didi's global ride-sharing network and differentiate it from Uber. Didi and its partners are present in some of the most important markets covering almost a half of the world's population. Consider that Didi Chuxing now records 14 million rides per day in China, but this is still just a drop in the bucket given the potential of the densely populated urban areas in Asia. Didi's global ride-sharing network could present a unique sales channel compensating for Apple's lack of car dealerships. Neil Cybart, a top Apple analyst from Above Avalon , sees Apple's investment in Didi similar to the company's initial partnership with AT&T (NYSE: T ) for the launch of the first iPhone. At that time, AT&T was looking for differentiation and new revenue streams, while Apple needed to learn about the telecommunications industry and looked for a distribution partner. Apple's investment with Didi likely marks the early stages of Apple's entry into the automotive business. Apple, however, needs to hurry up. Competition will be very intense in 2020 when the company is rumored to launch its EV. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) plans to launch its Model 3 way before then, in just about 18 months, and hints at self-driving capabilities. This might worry Apple as similar to ride-sharing those who get to the self-driving market early and build scale will benefit. The more self-driving cars you can get on the road, the more data you collect and the better their autonomous capability. On the other hand, some of the core technologies for electric vehicles like batteries still need to mature to allow for a mass-market driving range, while legislation needs to catch up with the rapidly evolving technology. At the end of the day, Apple will likely rely on what it has always worked so well for the company - it's not important to be the first, but the best and not too late. Apple's partnership with Didi Chuxing marks the company's official entry into the transportation business. Given Apple's historic product focus, the dynamics of the ride-sharing industry and the ways Apple can complement Didi's services with a physical product, I think the investment may actually mean the beginning of the company's automotive era. Apple's involvement in new industries shows that the company doesn't want to rely on its iPhone business and wants to innovate and remain relevant. This makes me confident that Apple has a bright future and shareholders with a long-term horizon will be rewarded.
