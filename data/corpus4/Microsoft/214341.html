Would Peter Lynch Buy Fitbit? | The Big Picture I just spent almost a year with a Fitbit Flex on my wrist. My wife bought us a matching pair for my birthday last October, and we were excited about tracking our fitness. The good news is I am 10 pounds lighter than I was a year ago. How much of that is attributable to the Flex is up for debate. Stock pickers could do worse than following the model developed by investing legend Peter Lynch. He didnâ€™t merely excel at “ Beating the Street ” — he trounced it. At Fidelity Magellan, the fund he ran, his returns averaged 29.2 percent annually during a 13-year span. Had you been lucky enough to put $10,000 into Magellan when Lynch took over the fund in 1977, it would have grown to $247,000 by the time he stepped down in 1990; an initial investment of $37,000 would have made you a millionaire. Lynchâ€™s advice for investors was straight-forward: Invest in what you know and understand; expect to hold stocks for the long run; research investments thoroughly, focusing on company fundamentals; most important of all, look for companies with modest Â price-earnings ratios relative to growth ( PEG ratio ). A lower PEG ratio can indicate that a stock is inexpensive in light of its potential earnings growth. Letâ€™s use Lynchâ€™s technique to look at the product (Flex) and the company (Fitbit). Â The idea of fitness trackers in general is great: You can’t manage what you canâ€™t measure. Having metrics that let you track your activities is both helpful and motivational.

Lastly, kindly forgo all civility in your discourse . . . you are, after all, anonymous. One of Peter Lynch’s fundamental precepts was looking for companies with a moat to protect their assets and earnings for an extended period of time. An example he gave as local quarry companies, since heavy rock and earthen materials are expensive to truck and competition is limited to just a few miles away – similarly, their land was also only subject to competition within a few miles. I don’t see any moat at all for Fitbit. It is small tech sitting on a wrist with dozens of small potential competitors, as well as huge ones (Apple & Samsung come to mind). The fitness basis for their algorithms is common knowledge. I don’t see any trade secrets or proprietary closed systems, like Blackberry’s communication network, that could provide a moat for a few years before better designed competitors can take over. One really good competitor and Fitbit is toast overnight, like many companies in the tech world. The best tech companies have fundamental embedded systems (Microsoft OS on billions of machines), high quality operational systems (Amazon), laser-like focus on design (Apple) etc. I only see Fitbit being a major company if they can become the Apple of fitness. I agree completely, and one of the things they would need to do to get to that point is establish a health database that one could share with doctors, hospitals, etc â€”Â the key principle here being that the user “owns” the data, they merely provide the repository to house it, and make it available to all others. Fitbit, despite its users clamoring for an interface between the data Fitbit collects and Apple’s Health database â€”Â I am told this is the #1 requested feature by Fitbit users â€”Â refuses to do so.  I am not clear on who “owns” the data Fitbit collects, but they are acting as if they do, not the user.  To me, that sounds like an anti-moat, the sort of thing that competitors could use to drive a wedge between Fitbit and potential customers. But that is probably just the way I see it, as Jawbone has a product that is nearly identical to Fitbit, except that the Jawbone product can interface with the Apple Health database, and so far as I can see, that does not appear to be drawing many customers to it.  If Fitbit were actively looking to prevent competitors from entering their market, about the only tactic at their disposal is for them to leverage their large customer base by bringing out an ever-decreasing-in-price line of products, using cost as their moat.  That does not seem to be the case, as each new product is a bit more expensive as its predecessor â€” a natural thing, for most companies, is to make their products increasingly profitable over time. Fitbit may be a “flash product”, that explodes in popularity, and then fades away just as quickly, or it may endure for a long time, but there is nothing I can see in what it offers that will compete with a device that does all the same measurements and also is programmable.  In a few years, the Apple watch (and probably others as well) will be ginormously more powerful, run for a week on a charge, and may even recharge itself from ambient RF noise (cell towers, TV stations, wifi), offering a platform that provides a hundred times the functionality of a Fitbit wrist band for less than double the price.  If Apple (or Alphabet, or Microsoft, or any other large tech company) wants to take Fitbit’s customers, there is nothing to stop them from doing so.
