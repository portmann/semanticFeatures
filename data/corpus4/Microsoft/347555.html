Is A Double-Digit Dividend Hike In Store For Apple Investors? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple has just released its newest growth initiative. The company is committed to dividend growth. The chatter about Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) always seems to change. The company used to be as good as dead back in the '90s, and then it was unbeatable, before a lot of people wrote it off after Steve Jobs passed away. Last year, pundits were once again bullish on the company's prospects, before turning more bearish lately . The company held an event on March 21, where it - among other things - revealed a widely expected new and smaller iPhone, called the iPhone SE. The moves are believed by most to be an initiative to increase sales in poorer countries, like India , where growth in the number of smartphones is expected to be high over the coming years. The stock has roughly doubled over the last five years. Certainly nothing to sneeze at. If you add in the approximate yield of 1.5-2% investors have enjoyed since 2012, the returns are even better. Even so, this growth has come with a lot of volatility, with the stock almost halving between 2012 and 2013, and dropping from approximately $130 a year ago to $107 now. Considering the massive buyback over the period, the performance is actually not that impressive. As most people know, there was a fairly long hiatus in Apple's dividend between its suspension in 1995 and until it was reinstated in 2012. Since the summer of 2012, the split-adjusted dividend has grown from $0.38 to $0.52 for a total percentage-wise growth of 37%, or 11% a year. The payout ratio naturally has an upward spike initially, as it was only reinstated in the summer of 2012. From a top of approximately 38% in early 2014, it has since fallen back to the current level of 22%. That is a conservative number by any measure, and leaves a lot of headroom for the board when considering future dividend increases. The dividend itself has a steady step-wise growth pattern to it - a pattern very much appreciated by dividend growth investors. If we are to believe Tim Cook's statement at the Q1 earnings release, the company is absolutely committed to keep this pattern going far into the future. Given Apple's incredible earnings, cash flow and rising cash pile over the years, I think a lot of people have been a bit disappointed that the dividend hasn't risen faster. Well, first of all, let's not forget that the company has a gigantic buyback program of $140 billion, which makes up the lion's share of its total capital return program . The board thus seems to favor the more tax-efficient method of buybacks when returning capital to shareholders. Second of all, a lot of the profits earned are earned outside of the United States . That makes it hard - or rather costly - to bring that money back to the U.S., as it would trigger taxes when repatriated. The tax-efficient way to solve this has been to issue debt and use those funds to finance the buybacks. It is therefore reasonable to believe that the board will hold back on committing itself to too high of a dividend, thereby risking having to issue more and more debt to fund it. It is more likely that it would want the dividend to be more or less covered by cash flow generated at home and issue debt to buy back stocks, as the buyback is way more flexible in terms of size adjustment than the dividend. In all years since the dividend was reinstated, Apple has consistently been announcing the dividend increase together with the company's Q2 report in late April. In recent years, strong EPS growth has given a lot of headroom for the board when setting the dividend. When EPS grows by 10%-plus, it's quite easy to increase the dividend by the same magnitude, as the payout ratio won't be affected. Estimates for the current year, however, is for virtually no growth, and some even predict a slightly lower EPS. The board can then either decide to stay put at the current payout ratio, or they can choose to see through the near-term weakness and increase the dividend anyway and let the payout ratio rise. Given the company's commitment to dividend hikes, the only question is really how much of an increase to the payout ratio the board is comfortable with. On the low end, an absolute minimum would be a hike in the low single digits. The reason for that is simply that Tim Cook has already all but promised an increase. Barring an extreme catastrophe to Apple's cash pile over the coming weeks - unlikely, to put it mildly - the dividend will be hiked by at least a couple of percentage points. As earnings growth is not likely to be stellar this year, that puts a brake on the upside when it comes to a hike. Though the board is likely to see through the current slow period, it is quite unlikely to boost the dividend by more than its historical average in such a year. Last year, with rapid EPS growth, I thought it would be a bit aggressive and go for a hike in the high end of an 11-15% range. It turned out to land in the lower end of the range instead. Based on this, I would expect the board to have a ceiling in terms of a percentage-wise dividend hike in the low double digits. One useful metric we can look at is the trend of dividend hikes over the years. As Apple has now been paying and increasing its dividend for several years, this metric is gaining in strength. The first hike was of 15%, the second of 8% and the last one of 11%. This gives us a clue that the board likes to hike the dividend at around the high-single digit, low-double digit area. It further shows us that it is not overly concerned with the EPS movement from year to year, as this has been everything from great to acceptable during these years. Based on the analysis above, I would expect the board to hike the dividend by between 8% and 11%. When rounded, that would put the new quarterly dividend at between $0.56 and $0.58. A major risk that Apple has quite clearly been emphasizing itself is the negative impact a rising dollar has on earnings as reported in U.S. dollars. The company supplied some supplementary material to its Q1 earnings announcement to highlight the impact of the changing currencies. Another risk is constant global competition from its well-known rivals, Alphabet ( GOOG , GOOGL ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ), and from newer, hungry competitors like Xiaomi . A company as profitable as Apple will always draw attention and competitors looking to grab a piece of the profit pool. There's also a risk of the landscape changing entirely with new technologies popping up, driven by new competitors which might replace Apple as a tech leader. Finally, there is a risk that the cash pile, large as it is, will be eroded over time by investments that will be costly and have a very uncertain profit opportunity - like, for instance, the car initiative. Apple is most certainly not an underfollowed name, so if there is any company out there that should be priced efficiently, this is it. Still, every individual investor has to make up his or her own mind as to whether or not the price of the stock justifies what one perceives as the underlying value. When looking at some key multiples, I like to compare those multiples with the competition. As competitors, I have chosen Samsung, as it competes fiercely with Apple in the smartphone space, and Microsoft as a more traditional software competitor. The table above reveals that Microsoft certainly seems expensive at the moment, with a price/earnings ratio far above the others' at 38.1x and a price/sales ratio almost double that of Apple's. The only category won by Microsoft is the dividend yield, which is in line with the yield of the S&P 500. Apple actually comes in second place in all three categories, with what must be said to be a modest price/earnings ratio of only 11.3x. Remember that a lot of what constitutes the price in Apple's case is cash, so from an operational standpoint, it is even cheaper. The most expensive company in terms of yield is Samsung, though it is clearly the cheapest in the other two categories. Microsoft looks too expensive for my taste, whereas both Apple and Samsung seem quite interesting at these levels, considering that the price/earnings for the S&P 500 is 17.7x at the moment. The mean analyst estimate for EPS growth at Apple over the next five years is for an annual growth of 11.6% . Assuming that the price/earnings ratio stays stable, and adding in the dividend yield of 2.0%, we arrive at an estimated total annual shareholder return over the next five years of 13.6%. That is above the long-term average returns of the stock market. When you can get such a return from the most profitable company in the world with a stellar brand and nice dividend growth, I would consider this a prudent investment for any dividend growth investor out there. Apple just revealed a new and smaller iPhone that will hopefully contribute to sales growth going forward. The company is committed to sharing its vast cash flow and cash pile with its shareholders by way of share buybacks and rising dividends. Expect this commitment to result in a dividend hike of 8-11% in late April. Apple is transforming into a safe stock with nice return potential for dividend growth investors.
