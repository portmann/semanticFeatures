Microsoft Is Playing Dangerous Games With The Gaming Industry - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft's new Xbox strategy is the first step in a series of moves designed to bring billions to its top line. The company is tapping into a $91.5 billion gaming market that's growing at 9% YoY. But is its approach essentially a monopolistic one that will alienate certain significant pockets of the games development community? Some in the know seem to think so. The way Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) is going at it, it seems the company wants to challenge the status quo on as many fronts as possible. Following hard on the heels of its acquisition of Xamarin, which I covered recently in " Microsoft Makes A Game-Changing Acquisition ", the company has once again shaken things up with the announcement of its latest gaming platform that can literally blur the lines between multiple devices. In a recent article by SA author Jimmy Lamz , he spoke about how Microsoft's new plan for gaming could catapult the company in the PC gaming space and move a step ahead of Sony (NYSE: SNE ), which was the clear winner of the console wars. I do agree with him that the move will allow Microsoft to break the closed ecosystem of console gaming and move into a more PC-style format that may or may not have more appeal, depending directly on the portability of the content with the console framework. However, I wanted to extend that analysis into what I think is the real motivation behind Satya Nadella and Phil Spencer's recent strategy decisions on the direction of XBox technology and the Universal Windows Platform fronted by the Windows 10 operating system. Nadella's agenda is clear - mobile first, cloud first. The first part of that is what the Xbox upgradeable console technology is all about - Microsoft's not-so-subtle move to unify platforms, so that everything that you enjoy on your PC, your laptop or your console can now be accessed through mobile devices. And not just any mobile device - one that runs on Microsoft's cross-platform OS, Windows 10. Within the gaming industry, this kind of cross-platform compatibility is unheard of. Until now, PC gaming and console gaming have been estranged cousins, with online gaming being a completely different species altogether. With this new move, users will be able to play the same games across their PC, their Xbox, their tablet and their smartphone. But the company is far from achieving that reality. The challenges of creating such a platform are many, not the least of which is the ability to entice games developers to create - and possibly re-create - games for the new cross-platform application. I believe the Xamarin acquisition is also one piece of the puzzle, but the significance of that is yet to be ascertained. From a practical standpoint, one of the biggest challenges I see Microsoft facing is getting the voluntary buy-in of independent developers and companies that are well aware of the problems with a seemingly open, but practically closed proprietary system such as the Universal Windows Platform. Even if they crack that code, there are a host of technical issues to resolve. I don't see all games being available on all devices, purely because of mobile devices' inherent limitations that will prevent graphics-heavy games from running on them. From the company's initial promotion of the concept above, it looks extremely attractive. But is it realistic? Think about that for a minute. The sheer processing power required for some of the world's favorite console or PC games will eliminate mobile devices from having access to them, won't it? By streaming content to your mobile device from your Xbox, you get the processing power of a hardware-upgradeable Xbox, along with the mobility advantages of your device. You may have to deal with inferior graphics and a different "feel" for each game, but Microsoft hasn't even gotten as far as to consider that yet. Or at least, it hasn't made its plans known publicly. The challenge here is to see through what Microsoft is saying and finding out what it's really up to. But before we get further into the subject, let's see what's at stake for the company. As of Q1 2016, there were 39 million active Xbox users. That's a full 9 million over the same period last year, which translates to 30% growth. In terms of revenue, Microsoft, despite its lost war for console dominance, is still firmly in second place ahead of Sony, and trailing behind Tencent ( OTCPK:TCEHY ), the Chinese company of League of Legends fame. Growth on that front is in the 34% range, the highest among the giants of the gaming world. Despite having such a huge control over the mobile operating system market share, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Google ( GOOG , GOOGL stand at sixth and seventh positions, respectively. That's understandable, because only a portion of the companies' respective reservoirs of games actually make them any money. Even so, their $2-3 billion revenues aren't that unimpressive, especially when you look at the fact that both of them are growing gaming revenues at over 25% year over year. With the $91.5 billion gaming market expected to grow at 9% rate for the next few years, none of these companies are going to take their foot off the gas pedal. This is a good thing, because it forces competition and benefits the end user tremendously. And you can clearly see that China and the United States are the biggest generators of this revenue. This means Tencent and Microsoft are in direct competition with each other, even though they operate in completely different gaming segments. I believe this is really what Microsoft is after. On one side, the company wants to create a closed environment within the PC games market to dominate it, and on the other, it wants to create a technology far beyond the capability of any console-based system. This is Nadella and Spencer's positioning for the Microsoft gaming business, but it comes with a plethora of problems. The main problem is with Microsoft's Universal Windows Platform itself. Although the Xbox to PC gaming blur is merely the company's first step in that fight against Tencent and Sony, many believe it will stifle competition and force the hands of developers. "Microsoft has launched new PC Windows features exclusively in UWP, and is effectively telling developers you can use these Windows features only if you submit to the control of our locked-down UWP ecosystem. They're curtailing users' freedom to install full-featured PC software, and subverting the rights of developers and publishers to maintain a direct relationship with their customers." Strong words coming from the founder of Epic Games, which goes back to 1991 and is one of the pioneers of online gaming as well as provider to the Xbox 360. Incidentally, Epic is also an associate of Tencent. But that's not all. Sweeney goes on to say: "The ultimate danger here is that Microsoft continually improves UWP while neglecting and even degrading win32, over time making it harder for developers and publishers to escape from Microsoft's new UWP commerce monopoly. Ultimately, the open win32 Windows experience could be relegated to Enterprise and Developer editions of Windows." Essentially, he's saying that developers and publishers, as well as users of the UWP, will be forced to comply with whatever Microsoft decides to allow. They will not be able to install third-party software without an in-depth knowledge of how to tweak the settings. This is eerily similar to what most perceive Apple's tightly curated App Store to be; but surprisingly, Sweeney alleges that Google pretty much follows the same methodology for Android. Most people are under the impression that the base code for Android is essentially open source, meaning non-proprietary, and that's true in theory. However, this is what Sweeney says is the reality: "Android makes it possible to install third-party applications outside of the Google Play store, which is required for Google to comply with the Linux kernel's GNU General Public License. However, Google makes it comically difficult for users to do so, by defaulting the option to off, burying it, and obfuscating it. This is not merely a technical issue: it has the market impact of Google Play Store dominating over competing stores, despite not being very good." Go figure! So, what he's telling us is that Microsoft is essentially headed in the same direction as Google in order to gain monopoly over the PC gaming industry. "Microsoft's intentions must be judged by Microsoft's actions, not Microsoft's words. Their actions speak plainly enough: they are working to turn today's open PC ecosystem into a closed, Microsoft-controlled distribution and commerce monopoly, over time, in a series of steps of which we're seeing the very first." So now I've laid out what I think is Microsoft's strategy to dominate the gaming industry without resorting to anything that would set off sensitive antitrust triggers. The company has already been in that fix before , but that was limited to certain contracts with PC manufacturers, and to specific competitors. If what Sweeney says Microsoft is trying to do is true, then the ramifications of that are on a scale never before imagined. The UWP has come under a lot of microscopic analyses and intense criticism from major players in the gaming industry, but what the company is trying to do here is completely legitimate... and therein lies the problem. If Microsoft is successful at it, the company could close down open PC as a platform for all practical purposes and bring everyone under the UWP umbrella. That means independent PC games developers as well as companies that publish using Microsoft's platforms. That's going to be great for Microsoft's Xbox and its entire gaming division's top line, but the whole idea seems to be carrying a ton of unpleasant baggage on its shoulders. I don't think Microsoft is looking at this from a "one game fits all" perspective, simply because that's not possible at all. Consoles will take the premium positioning for now, squarely aimed at avid gamers who rate gaming experience higher than cost. And whenever they cannot access their console, they can just open their Xbox app on their laptop and keep on playing. This will also help Microsoft attract the online gaming and mobile gaming communities to its fold. As I've said before, the biggest bump in the road is how the developer community reacts to this. It's a bold and risky bet that can only be successful if Microsoft aggressively pursues and woos game developers to embrace the idea and helps them every step of the way. If the company manages to do that, then Microsoft has all the ability to take the lead position in the console, online and mobile gaming markets as well as the premium and mass market segments.
