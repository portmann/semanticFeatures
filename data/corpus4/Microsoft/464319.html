Intel Reports Worst GAAP Earnings Since 2009; "Beats" Expectations Thanks To $1.4 Billion In Addbacks | Zero Hedge Bloomberg reports that the IMF has revised its original 3.2% forecast down to 3.1% for 2016 and from 3.5% to 3.4% for 2017. by Phoenix Capital... - Jul 20, 2016 11:40 AM While it is unclear why Intel stock is down after hours after reporting Q2 2016 earnings, which we can mostly attribute to the small miss in revenue, which came in at $13.5 billion, below the $13.55 billion expected, coupled with a data center group which grew only 5%, below the 15% growth forecasted (on platform volumes rising 5% and platform average selling prices down 1%,) , despite the company beating on the bottom line and on profit margin, it is quite clear that just like Microsoft, Intel engaged in yet another egregious non-GAAP fudging exercise when it reported non-GAAP EPS of only $0.27, which however promptly rose to $0.59, beating expectations of $0.54, only thanks to $1.4 billion in restructuring charge addbacks. For those who care about such things as actual earnings, this was thje lowest GAAP earnings per share INTC reported going back all the way to Q2 2009. This is what else Intel added: "Net income for the second quarter was $1.3B, down 51% on a year-on-year basis. Earnings per share was $0.27, down 28 cents on a year-on-year basis. During the quarter, we purchased $2.3B in capital assets, paid $1.2B in dividends, and repurchased $0.8B of stock." And since the company announced last quarter that it is laying off 12,000, in an abysmal Q1 earnings report... Professor Know ... Jul 20, 2016 4:44 PM "Odd how the restructuring charges almost prcisely offset the net income drop." Odd is one word for it. Legal fraud is another term for it.

Plunge protection team will gradually lift them to new highs because of 12k layoffs and "better than expected". Don't worry,just buy. This is not rocket science to figure out - the fucking universe already knows this, perhaps not to the degree of detail shown above. When the BOE, SNB, Fed, PBOC, ECB, BOJ and their coordinating banks like GS and JPM stop bidding the market with government debt, we may roll over.
