Apple: Carl Icahn Just Threw In The Towel, Should You? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Why Carl Icahn's $200+ price targets for Apple never made sense. Why Apple needs to make an acquisition or introduce a new hit gadget soon. Trading at just 10X earnings, what Apple needs to do to get Wall Street's respect. In this article, I show why Carl Icahn's valuation was off the mark, what I believe a reasonable valuation for Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) should be and what Apple CEO Tim Cook needs to do to earn Wall Street's respect as well as unlock shareholder value. Over the past two years, Apple has grown its bottom line ("EPS") by an average of 28%. One of the biggest reasons for such an increase has been because of Apple's capital return program where the company has been buying back $117 billion worth since 2012. But as we can see in the table below, 2016 is off to a rocky start as it's widely expected that Apple will see a dramatic drop on the bottom line (-9% YOY) this year. * Prior to 2Q results, estimates were for $9.17 After missing expectations on both the top and bottom lines, along with very discouraging guidance for the third quarter , Apple announced that its Board of Directors has authorized an increase of $50 billion to the company's existing program with the plans to now spend $250 billion by the end of March 2018. As part of the updated program, Apple will also increase its share repurchase authorization to $175 billion from the $140 billion level last year. This should provide support on the bottom line, but won't do much going forward for its top-line growth in the coming years. This of course - and as investors are finally figuring out - is why the company is trading at a discount to the overall market. While buying back shares is a resource to boost valuations and offset stock-based compensation, it also has some drawbacks. Instead of using its cash to make big-time acquisitions among other things, Cook seems content on just keeping things status quo. This is why I believe Cook needs to start making some moves that will benefit the company on a long-term basis, as well as unlocking shareholder value at the same time for a win-win situation. Steve Jobs, Apple's co-founder and former CEO, was notorious for taking on risks. Sometimes it worked out, and sometimes it didn't. But the main thing was that he kept working on and ultimately delivering the next big thing. Meanwhile, Cook hasn't done much of anything since taking over as CEO. Now Apple has turned into a copycat as its products take pages from companies such as Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ). When Microsoft debuted its Surface tablet in 2012, cartoonist Joel Watson drew an amazing prescient comic (pardon the profanity at the link), predicting a typical Apple move in the coming years, which has come to pass. This is why shares consistently tank right after the company's "special" September event. Investors don't care about new phone colors, etc., but closely watch for new products and hints about what's ahead for the company. And if management isn't careful, Apple could follow other notable companies such as IBM (NYSE: IBM ) into the "death by buybacks." Once valued at more than $200 billion and despite spending hundreds of billions of dollars in stock buybacks over the past decade, shares of IBM have and continue to go down. Investors everywhere - particularly the mom and pop investors - love to track what hedge funds, money managers, activist investors, etc., are doing with their money. The thinking goes that based on their history, net worth, popularity etc., that these guys can't lose with all of the resources they have at their disposal. Surely these guys are a lot smarter than the average Joe right? Now I'm not saying he wasn't profitable by any means as he claimed to have made over $2 billion in profit , but here are several reasons why I never jumped on the Apple/Icahn bandwagon train. 1) Apple TVs - In one of his open letters to Cook, Icahn wrote about how Apple was poised to enter several "new markets": "Apple is poised to enter and in our view dominate two new categories (the television next year and the automobile by 2020) with a combined addressable market of $2.2 trillion, a view investors don't appear to factor into their valuation at all." - Source Yet, despite speaking "numerous times" with Cook, Icahn clearly didn't understand what the company was about. In the same letter, Icahn predicted that Apple would start selling 55-inch and 65-inch ultra-high-definition sets in 2016, generating revenue of $15 billion in 2016 alone. But wait, here's the kicker. How's Apple going to generate those profits in a product that it isn't even going to produce? Not long after, the Wall Street Journal reported that Apple shelved plans more than two years ago on the television units. That was the first of many daggers for Icahn in his attempt to pump up prices. 2) Unrealistic Price Target - In another one of his letters, Icahn forecast full-year EPS for 2016 and 2017 at $12.75 and $16.73, respectively. Yet, realistic expectations such as mine were much, much lower than that. Fast forward a bit and here we are with EPS expectations for Apple of just $8.36 and $9.25 in 2016 and 2017. That's nearly a 45% miss. Icahn also gave Apple a market multiple of 18 despite history showing us that shares haven't traded that high in years. Shares have been stuck in the 8-14 range. Icahn even went on to claim that is 18X multiple was very conservative, saying: ... with a combined addressable market size of $2.2 trillion, we think a multiple of 18x is a very conservative premium to that of the overall market. Considering the massive scope of its growth opportunities and track record of dominating new categories, we actually think 18x will ultimately prove to be too conservative. Yet, with his $240 price target and "Apple is a no-brainer" comments, Icahn announced last week that he's sold his entire position at a time when shares were trading at less than $100 a share. Apple is still the most valuable company to date ($513B), but its rivals aren't far behind. Google ("Alphabet") (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) is valued at $486B, Microsoft stands at $392B and social media giant Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) sits at $337B. Since initiating his position in 2013, Icahn has turned into Apple into a buyback machine for his personal gain. Over the nine quarters that Icahn owned shares in Apple, the iPhone company spent nearly $90B worth in buybacks. Acquisitions And Why Apple Needs To Tell Its Story Apple could have very well spent that $90B+ on acquisitions as it looks to diversify from the iPhone hold which produces a large majority of its revenues (nearly 70%). And it's not like the company is short on cash with more than $232B at the end of the quarter. Even so, that $90B on buybacks could have been used instead to acquire companies such as Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) with plenty of cash left over. Now I'm not saying that's what it should have done or should do, but that investors are looking for the next big thing and the Apple Watch certainly isn't going to move the needle. Many even consider it a bust after waiting five years for Apple's next big thing. Tesla and Netflix continue to get premium valuations from the market because of the growth and because of the story these companies have laid out for investors. Apple doesn't have that right now as we witnessed with Icahn. Despite his many meetings with Cook, even the billionaire himself didn't have much of a clue as to where the company was headed and what the company was actually working on. Simply put, investors and analysts need a clear picture from management, and if improvement isn't made, Apple will continue to trade below the market averages. Think about it. iPhones represent close to 70% of revenues for the tech giant. Now what happens when sales start to slow as we've seen? Based on the market's reaction over the past several years, investors simply don't know Apple's story. Every day there seems to be a rumor that Apple is getting into the ______ (fill in the blank) business. Remember those ultra-high-definition television sets that "were" coming out in 2016? Also, the lack of diversification and the reliance on a maturing and stalling smartphone market has turned off shareholders. In China, where Apple was expected to deliver dominate growth over the coming years, saw a 26 percent sales decline. Not only that, but also risks still lie ahead due to the unpredictability of the Chinese government. This year, China shut down iTunes Movies and iBooks just six months after they were released. This isn't new as Facebook, Google, IBM, among many others that have run into many stumbling blocks in China. Here's something to think about. Where would shares be if it wasn't for the massive buyback program over the past several years? Would shares have been in the $60 and $70s without the support from the buyback plan, or would shares have rallied on speculation that the company was saving its cash to make some big moves? Either way, there are several positive and negative takeaways right now. While seeing players such as Icahn move out isn't a welcome sign to many investors, it's also a breath of fresh air for some as all of the drama that Icahn brought slowly disappears. So where do I believe Apple goes from here over the next 12 months? Well, it depends on several things. The most important near-term event that investors need to pay attention to is the all-important $91-92 level. Over the years, shares of Apple have bounced at this crucial point in time as you can see in the image below. If Apple continues to repurchase shares at a fast rate - which it has been known to do - and make some acquisitions along the way, I see shares running up into the $120-125 range and even higher depending on the type of acquisition. At the same time, if shares far below the $91-92 level, investors should expect shares to test the $81-82 level, which implies downside of around 11% from Monday's close ($93.64). Based on the current mood from investors, I believe the market will value Apple based on 8X to 12X earnings (a drop from 10 to 15) based on what we've seen in the past. Shares are currently trading at 10X earnings and will likely trade sideways ($82-110) over the next year or so, barring any acquisitions or new product launches. I believe shares would be a "no-brainer" if they were to fall into the low-$80 range and would look to lock in profits in the $100+ range. I don't see enough catalysts this year to offset the disappointing sales growth, which will likely keep shares in check. Lastly, just because Icahn bailed on Apple doesn't necessarily mean you should too. The company has a rock-solid balance sheet, great margins and a loyal customer base. 2016 is just shaping up to be more of a transitional year for the company. And because of this, I believe there are better investments out there that offer investors bigger returns. For those that don't like a lot of risk, I would consider opening a position once shares regain their footing, which we should see soon as shares test the all-important $91-92 level.
