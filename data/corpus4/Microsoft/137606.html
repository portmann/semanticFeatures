Amazon Echo Is Coming To Staples, But Not One Near You – Only Online â€“ Consumerist Whoops! It looks like portions of our site are being blocked! Check your browser settings or contact your network administrator. So who will be the first retailer to offer Amazon’s high-tech, sort-of assistant speaker? None other than the e-tailer’s office supply rival Staples. The Verge reports that Amazon struck a deal to sell its web-connected home entertainment speaker (also known as Siri in a box ) through Staples, but not actually in stores. While it’s not uncommon for tech companies to sell their products and devices through third parties after a period of time, Amazon’s choice to only have the Echo sold online through Staples is a bit of a head-scratcher. That’s because the company made Echo available to all customers back in June. Prior to that, only Prime members who placed their names on a waiting list received invitations from the company to buy the speaker. Even then, customers who received invites had a hard time actually acquiring Echo, as wait times for shipping spanned weeks to months. The Verge suggests that since the instant gratification of going to a store and taking Echo home in one swoop isn’t possible, the only other reason it makes sense to purchase through the office supply store is if you’re a rewards member.
