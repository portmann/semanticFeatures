ETF Hub Apr 16 2015, 09:48 ET | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor Following months of talks , Yahoo ( YHOO +0.2%) and Microsoft ( MSFT -0.4%) have restructured their search alliance (struck in 2009, lasts until 2020). Notably, Yahoo will "now have increased flexibility to enhance the search experience on any platform, since the partnership is non-exclusive for both desktop and mobile." The companies previously disclosed the alliance was non-exclusive on mobile, but hadn't announced anything similar for PCs. They now only state Yahoo "will continue to serve Bing ads and search results for a majority of its desktop search traffic." At the same time, Microsoft will now "become the exclusive salesforce for ads delivered by Microsoft's Bing Ads platform." Yahoo will continue exclusively providing the salesforce for its Gemini mobile search/native ad platform. "Satya [Nadella] and I have worked closely together to establish a revised search agreement that allows us to enhance our user experience and innovate more in our search business," says Marissa Mayer, who has previously voiced disappointment about the performance of the Microsoft deal. The deal has required Microsoft to make revenue per search (RPS) guarantees equal to a % of Google's estimated RPS. Thanks to RPS payment changes, Yahoo's search revenue (ex-TAC) was flat Y/Y in Q4, even though its search click-based revenue (excludes RPS payments) was up 18%. The restructuring follows a deal by Yahoo to displace Google as Firefox's default U.S. search provider, and comes amid reports Yahoo/Microsoft are trying to sell Apple on replacing Google as Safari's default provider (including on iOS). comScore estimates Bing had a 20.1% March U.S. search share, and Yahoo a 12.7% share; international shares are lower. Bing crosses 20% for the first time after picking up 0.3% for the month; the large gain seems odd relative to historic moves, but nice to see Bing over 20% - finally!
