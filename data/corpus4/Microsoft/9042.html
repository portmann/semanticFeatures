Why Your Only Edge With Large Caps Is Valuation | Seeking Alpha You'll learn exactly how valuation is your ONLY edge in the market. The two points you need to identify with large caps to make a ton of money. How Apple, Whole Foods were perfect examples. I often make the mistake of being an armchair investor. That is, just sitting at my desk, reading filings and believing I understood the business. But today, I'm going to look at the flipside. When it's okay to be an armchair investor. With many small cap stocks, you need to put in the extra effort because there isn't as much information available. Many small caps are under-followed, misunderstood, had solvable issues and cheap. These are the stocks where you can get One Up On Wall Street. But for blue chips, it's never under followed and rarely misunderstood. The minute something happens, you will be one of the last to know. If you have special insight, that's called insider trading. Otherwise, it's already been analyzed, scrutinized and argued to death. That's why when I invest in a company like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) or Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), I don't bother trying to predict what the next product will be. Who cares what screen size the iPhone will be.... This is one of the times where it's okay to be an armchair investor. It's better than spending days or weeks trying to find information about whether sapphire crystal or Corning glass is better. After all, does it really matter? When investment articles talk about things like the future of 4K screens and how Apple will be the leader, I take it as noise because it's not just Apple that will benefit. The entire industry will get a lift from such technology. Ultimately, with blue chips, the only two avenues you can focus on is finding companies with Take a look at BP (NYSE: BP ) after the oil spill fiasco. If you had iron guts, and managed to tune out the noise, this turned out to be a great investment. The Japan tsunami in 2011 was horrific and I pray that something like this never happens to any country. But there was opportunity amidst the disaster with Tokyo Electric (OTCPK: TKECF ). A crisis opportunity is a terrible opportunity to waste You have to spot the fixable problems BP was a fixable solution as an investment. The environment from the spill and tsunami are still impacted, but for the companies, they are fixable issues. Back to Big Solvable Issues and Cheapness The only two avenues you can focus on is finding companies with Both 1 and 2 end up pointing to valuation. Your only edge with large cap stocks is the price you pay. A great investment opportunity occurs when a marvelous business encounters a one-time huge, but solvable problem. The biggest stock I own at the moment is Apple and when I started writing about Why Apple Wasn't Worth $460 (pre split) , I just focused on the fundamentals and valuation. I still hold Apple and it's currently my biggest holding. I'm not selling anytime soon when I focus on the fundamentals and the tailwinds it is riding on. Right now, I see that Apple's intrinsic value is around $130-$140 . And today, I'm pleased to say that both 1 and 2 has disappeared for Apple, simply by ignoring the noise that surrounds the company. When I started buying Whole Foods (NASDAQ: WFM ), it was a carbon copy of the situation Apple was in 2013. Perceptions around Whole Foods was down. Pessimism was at a high and the stock was at a 52-week low. But 3 short months later, things started to turn around and here's my full thoughts and analysis on what Whole Foods is worth today . That's a big range, but the growing demand in the organic food business is strong and now that Wall Street has realized its mistake, the stock is being pushed up. Note that in my analysis, I tried to eliminate as much noise as possible. It's easy to over emphasize and base an investment idea on a point that you realize isn't important to begin with. Been there, done that. You Have Zero Edge for Large Caps - Except for One Thing Valuation, valuation, valuation. Let the market dance foolishly over things that don't matter in the long term. All I know is that the best investors like Warren Buffett, Ben Graham, Monish Pabrai, Bill Ackman and Francis Chou got to where they are by looking for temporary fear and solvable issues and loading the truck at cheap prices. The only thing you can control 100% of the time is the price you pay. Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
