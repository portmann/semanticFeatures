The Navy Will Pay Microsoft For Windows XP Support Through 2016 â€“ Consumerist Whoops! It looks like portions of our site are being blocked!

More than a year ago, Microsoft phased out support for its immensely popular Windows XP operating system, but some users simply can’t let go. Like the United States Navy, which won’t be ready to upgrade its systems until 2016, and has to pay Microsoft $9 million a year to keep systems still running Windows XP going. “The Navy relies on a number of legacy applications and programs that are reliant on legacy Windows products. Until those applications and programs are modernized or phased out, this continuity of services is required to maintain operational effectiveness,” a spokesperson for Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command told CNN. This should make it less scary to combine the concepts of “Warfare Command” and “Windows XP,” but at least that’s better than running XP without support from Microsoft. The Navy says that the non-updated computers are all on the sea, working hard on ships, submarines, and aircraft carriers. Their contract with Microsoft can be extended until 2017 if the planned upgrade takes longer than planned. They aren’t the only federal agency sticking with the older operating system: the IRS notably still uses it for some functions. ATMs were still running the operating system well past the support deadline, too.
