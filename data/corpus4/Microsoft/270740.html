Why China Is So Important To Microsoft's Future - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft made the big concession of allowing the Chinese government to get a custom Windows 10 operating system. This goes to show that Microsoft puts a lot of importance over its future in China. In spite of the rampant software piracy in China, Microsoft still needs that country of 1.4 billion people to stay loyal to Windows. China banned Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Windows 8 for government-related procurement last May 2014. The ban was part of a state directive over 'energy-saving' measures. It was definitely an angry reaction against Microsoft's decision to end support for Windows XP. The old Windows XP OS was still used by more than 50% of all computers in China. Microsoft's discontinuation of support/updates for Windows XP clearly exposed Chinese computers to virus and hacking attacks. The Chinese government did not like this and made its displeasure felt. Microsoft was previously in danger last year from China's antitrust allegations over the Windows operating system. China's government even helped create its own homegrown OS, NeoKylin that it wanted as a replacement for Windows. The anti-Windows sentiment of China even inspired American PC vendor Dell to sell many of its computers in China with NeoKylin OS pre-installed. The obvious threat was that Windows was going to become ostracized in China. The screen shot below reveals NeoKylin looks a lot like the old Windows XP operating system of Microsoft. NeoKylin therefore was a stern warning against Microsoft that Windows' dominance in China is open to government intervention. As a Communist country, the government still dictates what products that its citizens can buy/use. The possible global implication of China's mighty government machinery giving away a free, English-friendly , Linux-based NeoKylin operating system that looks like Windows XP was also little worrisome. Windows managed to beat all other Linux OS distributions like Ubuntu before. However, a China government-distributed Linux OS (with the aesthetics of Windows XP) could potentially reach 500 million PC users within a few years. Investors should therefore feel relieved that Nadella is now doing his best to placate the irate Chinese. In a marked departure from Microsoft's grand Universal Windows 10 design, Chinese government institutions will get a special custom Windows 10 OS. This deal with China's government is different from the distribution deal with Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU ). Microsoft only modified the Windows 10 for Baidu's distribution in exchange for using Baidu's search engine (instead of Bing). Partnering up with the omnipotent Chinese government is a likely more beneficial move for Microsoft than the partnership with Baidu. State-owned China Electronics Technology Group Corporation (CETC) will set-up a joint venture with Microsoft for the purpose of licensing and deploying a customized version of Windows 10. CETC is the premier corporation in charge of integrating advanced civilian/commercial technology to improve China's "Rich Country, Strong Army" ambition. The partnership with CETC is a bigger win than Microsoft's previous win to provide custom cloud-based services for state-owned institutions in China throughout its local partners 21Vianet and Unisplendour. It is still best for Microsoft's future in China if the computers accessing its custom cloud services are running Windows 10, not NeoKylin. My point is that we should all thank Nadella for being the perfect ambassador that finally won the approval from the Chinese political overlords. Unlike Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ) and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), Microsoft again enjoys great guanxi with China. While it is true that piracy is rampant in China, CETC's licensing of Windows 10 could have profound long-term economic benefits for Microsoft. A government-initiated move to control and deploy authentic licensed Windows 10 could lead to lesser dissemination of pirated Microsoft software in China. Windows 10 is important towards Microsoft's future. CETC's help could go a long way towards improving Window 10's super-slow adoption in China. Let us not forget that Microsoft gave Windows 10 an anti-piracy feature that could disable pirated or illegal software. In spite of its 600 million users, Baidu's assistance will not help much towards increasing Windows 10 adoption in China. Sad but true, the ordinary Baidu-using PC owner likely fears the anti-piracy feature of Windows 10. The Middle Kingdom has always been a problematic market for Microsoft because of its pervasive software piracy problem. The government sector therefore is the better avenue for Microsoft to increase adoption of Windows 10 in China. By collaborating with CETC, Microsoft investors could expect that the majority of China's public sector agencies and state-owned corporations will use a licensed (paid-for) Windows 10 OS and possibly Office 2016/Office 365. Unlike the regular Chinese PC user at home, CETC deals with government firms that are unlikely to use pirated software. Like in other countries, government firms have allocated budgets for their IT hardware/software requirements. There were no specific details leaked about this deal with CETC. However, I believe that China is paying money to license a special customized Windows 10. Microsoft still charges a fee to OEMs to pre-install Windows 10 on new computers. The same no-freebie thing could likely be involved with the joint venture with CETC. Microsoft would never have acceded to a third party entity getting a modified Windows 10 without money involved. CETC's people will likely only customize Window 10 to remove spying-related features that Microsoft recently implemented in its latest operating system. The CETC joint venture meant China's people would access/test the customized Windows 10 code to check if it meets their 'security requirements'. Without this concession, Nadella would not have landed this important win for Windows 10. This collaboration with CETC is similar to International Business Machines' (NYSE: IBM ) decision to allow the Chinese Government to review the proprietary source code of its software products. Microsoft is also allowing the joint venture with CETC to offer direct technical support/updates for government-owned Windows 10 computers. This should help Microsoft save money from after-sales overhead in its China operations. China also obviously benefits from this deal with Microsoft. I suspect that many private and government Chinese firms created and still use custom legacy software that are dependent on being fully compatible with Windows operating systems. With direct access to a custom Windows 10, CETC customers have little need to rebuild (or risk breaking) their existing software library to work on NeoKylin's platform. MSFT remains a Buy. Without the deal with CETC, Windows 10 would have suffered the same ban that Windows 8 incurred last year. Nadella is a pragmatic leader that knows how to adapt to political winds. Kowtowing to the biddings of Chinese politicians is just part of staying successful in China. Even if Microsoft only charges $5 per government computer installation of Windows 10, the partnership with CETC could lead to hundreds of millions of potential annual revenue. Google's search engine and core software products are also still banned in China. Microsoft could leverage its newly acquired great guanxi with Chinese politicians to get involved gradually in China's online/mobile advertising industry. As far as I know, the CETC deal did not mention Microsoft removing Bing or Skype for the government-centric custom Windows 10 version. The issue of China's rampant software piracy problem is not that important compared to the possibility of Windows being replaced by NeoKylin OS in consumer and government computers. Going forward, a user of pirated Windows is still a great potential pair of eyeballs for Bing Ads or Skype Ads. A Chinese computer, whether using licensed or pirated Windows OS, remains a potential gateway for Windows 10 App Store sales.
