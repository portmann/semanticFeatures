Microsoft Plugged The Hole That Let Lumia Users Run Android Apps - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha I previously said Microsoft should fix the bug that allowed tech-savvy users to run native Android apps on Lumia phones. Project Astoria is for developers only, not for general public use. Microsoft wants Lumia phone users to use the official Windows App store, not Googleâ€™s Play Store for in-app purchases. I discussed last month that it was possible for tech-savvy people to run Android apps on Lumia phones with 1GB of RAM. My suggestion before was for Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) to immediately plug this hole in the Project Astoria kit. Well, Microsoft has indeed fixed this bug/exploit because it is necessary to protect its Lumia and app store business. The geeks who could run Android apps were able to use Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Play Store for in-app purchases on cheap Windows 10-enabled hardware like the sub-$100 Lumia 435. This was unfair to Microsoft since it is likely subsidizing the low prices of entry-level Lumia smartphones. Microsoft obviously wants Lumia buyers to do exclusive in-app purchases on ported Android games only via the Windows 10 official app store. I therefore salute Nadella's quick action to eliminate the said illegal/unofficial way to run Android Apps and Google Mobile Services on Windows 10 devices. Project Astoria would become a laughingstock for industry observers if it becomes just another channel for Google to make more sales from the Play Store. Enabling Google Mobile Services on Lumia handsets also allows Google to track Windows 10 Mobile users' personal data for advertising purposes. Microsoft urgently needs a more robust app store business to help it offset the lost revenue from giving away free Windows 10 Mobile OS licensing to device manufacturers. Project Astoria was supposed to help Android app developers easily port their games/applications to the Windows 10 platform. Project Astoria is not meant for ordinary people to run native Android apps on their Lumia/Windows 10 devices. It is pointless for Microsoft to sell millions of sub-$100 Lumia handsets every year if people buying them will just use Google Play to do their in-app purchases. Microsoft's ambition was to let Android developers quickly replace the Google Mobile Services API with Microsoft's own mobile services/app store. There are billions of dollars at stake on this matter. Google doesn't care if its Android OEM partners kill each other with their race-to-the-bottom price wars. Google still makes great money from its 30% cut from the billions of dollars worth of apps and in-app purchases being bought by Android device users. The latest App Annie Q2 2015 report revealed Google's Play Store is now generating higher number of downloads and revenue than Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) App Store. The sheer volume of cheap Android phones being sold daily today has helped Google create a very lucrative app store business. Microsoft should try and imitate this by continuing its strategy of selling entry-level Lumia phones to further propagate its own Windows 10 mobile services. It is very reassuring to investors that Microsoft fixed The Project Astoria bug before Windows 10 Mobile gets it official commercial launch. Building up the Windows 10 app store is now a lot easier since app developers will need to actually port their Android apps to Windows 10 if they want to monetize the millions of Lumia device owners. It might be better for Microsoft to create and release free custom Windows 10 ROMs that will let people install Windows 10 on their Android phones. This is a better idea than Lumia Windows 10 device owners being able to run Android apps and Google Mobile Services on their handsets. While Project Astoria is free, it is not a guarantee that the top-grossing Android app developers will officially port their apps to the Windows 10 Mobile OS platform. Majority of the top-grossing Android games are still not available for Windows 10 devices. The prompt action of Microsoft to stop the illegal use of Lumia to run native Android apps is one more reason to trust Nadella and Microsoft. This company's future is now in the good hands of a very reactive management team. Under Nadella's management, Microsoft is now even wise enough to settle anti-trust legal suits before they go to trial. He was the man who was also aggressive in porting Office 365 to Android and iOS devices. Platform-agnostic subscription-based software sales are now Microsoft's great white hope. MSFT is a Buy. This company has a wide moat and tons of cash reserves. Microsoft is also a decent dividend giving company with a strong history of doing share buybacks.
