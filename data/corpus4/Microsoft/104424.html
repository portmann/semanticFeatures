Intel: PC Weakness Priced In - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Analysts getting bearish on Intel due to PC weakness. Shares close to $30, dividend yield near 3.20%. 2015 has not been a kind year for investors of chip giant Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ). Shares of the name have lost nearly 17% year to date, while the NASDAQ index is up almost 6%. The company's March revenue warning reinforced how reliant the company is on the PC industry. Unfortunately, things are not looking good in that space currently, the focus of many recent negative analyst notes. In this article, I examine recent street commentary, and discuss why I think most to all of this fear has been priced into this stock. Goldman Sachs came out with a very negative note during June, cutting its EPS estimates for the year based on weak PC demand. The analyst saw downside risk to notebook shipments for Q2, and didn't believe that we'd see that much of a Windows 10 boost in the second half of 2015. A few days after the Goldman note, Deutsche Bank also trimmed its Intel estimates. Wednesday's most recent analyst note, a price target cut from FBR, was based on Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) new Windows upgrade strategy combined with weakness in PC original design manufacturer builds. While the analyst reiterated an Outperform rating on Intel shares, he cut his price target by $2 to $38, lowered his PC shipment forecast, and reduced his 2015 EPS estimate for Intel. With Microsoft offering free upgrades to Windows 10, the fear is that we won't see as much of a PC sales bump when the new operating system launches. In addition to worries over Greece hurting the markets at times, the semiconductor names were hit after Micron's (NASDAQ: MU ) recent revenue/earnings miss and weak guidance. The industry is banking on the launch of Windows 10 and Intel's new Skylake CPU platform to spark a rebound in PC sales. As of late May, research firm IDC was forecasting a 6.2% decline in PC sales for 2015. The PC group represented more than 62% of Intel's revenues last year. Even though the company is working on growth areas like the Data Center and Internet of Things, it still relies heavily on the PC space. With more and more analysts issuing negative notes on Intel, we've seen average estimates hit new lows. The current average revenue figure for Q2 is $13.16 billion, just a bit below Intel's guidance midpoint for $13.20 billion. I'm a bit more interested in what management has to say for the full year at this point, especially how things are looking for the second half. Intel's latest guidance was for "approximately flat" revenues in 2015, but analysts are now calling for a 1.1% decline. A few more estimate cuts before the July 15th earnings report and analysts will basically be looking for Intel to reduce its full year forecast. Overall, I think a lot of this weakness has been priced into Intel shares. Now might be a good time to buy if you believe the company will maintain its full year forecast in a few weeks. Intel has a nearly 3.20% annual dividend yield, equal to a 30-Year US Treasury bond and above peer Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ). Intel shares also are going for about 14 times expected 2015 GAAP EPS, while Qualcomm shares are going for more than 18 times the midpoint of its fiscal year GAAP EPS forecast. Qualcomm is also guiding for its GAAP EPS to plunge by 21% to 29% this year. Intel's management does not provide EPS guidance, but analysts are only looking for a 7% decline in EPS. Intel shares closed Wednesday less than a dollar from their 52-week low. We continue to see negative analyst notes citing PC weakness, and estimates have come down. Intel may end up showing a revenue decline this year, unless the PC industry does better than expected in the second half of 2015. At this point, however, I think the stock has priced in most to all of this expected weakness. Shares now go for just 14 times expected earnings, well below the valuation of peer Qualcomm, and Intel's dividend yield is almost 3.20%. For those that believe in Intel's future, where we'll see less reliance on the PC space, the recent pullback provides a good opportunity to pick up some shares.
