That pledge was a bit too ambitious, it seems, as the company announced it’ll need more time to reach that point. The company is still aiming for that 1 billion mark, but it didnâ€™t give itself a new deadline, at least, not publicly this time. â€œWindows 10 is off to the hottest start in history with over 350 million monthly active devices, with record customer satisfaction and engagement,â€? Yusuf Mehdi, Windows marketing chief, said in a statement via ZDNet . â€œWeâ€™re pleased with our progress to date, but due to the focusing of our phone hardware business, it will take longer than FY18 for us to reach our goal of 1 billion monthly active devices.â€? The phone hardware business he mentions refers to the companyâ€™s ill-fated Windows phone strategy. After buying Nokia Oyjâ€™s handset unit, it was forced to shut down and sell that business when costs skyrocketed, Bloomberg notes . That took a lot of wind out of Windows 10â€™s sails, Ars Technica points out, as Microsoft was counting on selling 50 million phones a year, all of them with the new operating system on it. There also may have been fewer downloads of Windows 10 once Microsoft made its update prompts a bit less pushy , after people complained that the company was being a giant nag.
