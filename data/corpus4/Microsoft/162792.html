Microsoft: An Extreme Ebb And Flow Example - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft as a stock is probably best known for its high valuation during the dot.com bubble and the subsequent decline in the share price. Yet this notion of share price moving out of step with business performance is not constrained to a single time period. This article demonstrates the extreme â€œebb and flowâ€? pricing history of the company as it relates to business performance. In a previous article I used the J.M. Smucker Company (NYSE: SJM ) as an illustration of a company that exhibited the "ebb and flow" of share prices quite well. That is, the security demonstrated the reality that share prices tend to bounce about quite a bit while the business performance is apt to be much steadier. Eventually things more or less work out in the long term, but in the interim you can see a large disconnect between price and value. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) is an even more extreme example of this "ebb and flow" concept. Let's work through various periods to demonstrate what I mean. From 1994 through 1999 Microsoft was able to increase its earnings-per-share by 30% to 40% per year. During the same time the share price rocketed up by nearly 70% per year, resulting in the now infamous dot.com bubble valuation. It's not that the company wasn't showing exceptional growth, potential and improvement - it certainly was. Instead, it was merely the fact that investors were willing to pay an even higher valuation. The market bids (share price) far outgrew the wonderful performance of the business. Naturally this once euphoric time led to future disappointment. Microsoft was not able to keep up its immense growth rate. Yet that's not to suggest that it didn't grow at all. From fiscal year 1999 through fiscal year 2005, Microsoft grew earnings per share by an average compound rate of 8.8% per year. Respectable for most companies, but not nearly enough to support 50+ times earnings. As a result, the share price declined quite a bit. It went from over $45 to under $25 at year end, resulting in an annual decline of nearly 10%. This is the sort of thing that's important to watch out for. Some might classify this is "dead money," but I would contend that this doesn't capture the essence of the story very well. The company was still cruising along, turning in 9% annual growth. The problem was valuation. Moving from 2005 to 2014, a further story can be told. Here's a look at the company's metrics during that period: As you can see it's more or less an " up and down " story. Nine percent annual revenue growth turned into "just" 6.3% total earnings growth due to margin compression. Then the company was able to meaningfully reduce its share count such that earnings per share grew by 9.5% per year. Finally, the stock saw P/E compression over the period, resulting in share price growth of about 6% per year. If you add in dividends, you come to a collective total return of 7.4% per year. Overall this looks reasonable: you had a company growing in the mid-to-high single digits and your investment returns would have been in this range. Yet this period also can be divided into two different time periods. At the end of fiscal year 2005, shares of Microsoft were trading hands around $25. The earnings per share were a bit over $1.10, resulting in a P/E ratio in the 21 to 22 range. At the end of fiscal year 2011, the company was earning nearly $2.70 per share, or a growth rate of about 15% per year. As a result of this strong growth, you might suspect that the share price would grow quite robustly as well. Yet this wasn't the case. Six years later, with earnings more than twice as high, the share price was just $26. As an investor you had to watch patiently as the business continued to generate more and more profits, resulting in a larger and larger earnings claim, while the share price effectively stagnated. The earnings multiple went from above 20 to under 10. That's the sort of ebb and flow nature that's hard to deal with psychologically. People like instant results. Waiting years and years, with an improving business but a stagnant stock price is a true test. For those who believe in the company it could indeed be a buying opportunity. For those who are more skeptical or take their cues from price action, it could be a reason to sell a security that just keeps getting cheaper. Then a funny thing happened. From 2011 through 2014 Microsoft's earnings went down slightly - both in a per share sense and on a company-wide basis. When you see something like that, you might suspect that the share price would follow suit. Yet this didn't occur. Instead, the share price went from $26 up to $42, a 60% climb in the face of stagnating (actually declining) earnings. Business performance and share price performance, especially in the short- to medium-term, can be too drastically different things. This is what extreme ebbs and flows look like. (Note that adjusted earnings and fiscal year-ends were used) Over the very long time frame you might suspect that the share price more or less catches up or falls back in line with business performance, but it can certainly over and under shoot. A lot of stuff happens in between. You had a period of exceptional earnings growth with even more impressive share price increases. Then you had a six-year stretch where earnings grew nicely, but the share price collapsed mightily. This was followed by a second six-year stretch where earnings grew at a very solid rate, yet the share price hardly budged. Finally, coincidentally once the growth began to stagnant, the share price shot up. It's not a linear process. Eventually it will work out, but you can't anticipate for it to occur on your schedule or even on cue with business performance. Moreover, this doesn't just apply to the dot.com bubble. More recently, just because a security returned an average of 7% per year over a decade, this doesn't mean it happened each and every 12-month period. As illustrated above, this was quite far from reality. The business has been rather consistent, but the share price moves in fits and starts. Recognizing these types of situations can better enable you to think about partnership decisions as you move through the investing process.
