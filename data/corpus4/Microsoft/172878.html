Microsoft: VoloMetrix Acquisition Provides Synergistic New Tech For Total Model Overlay - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft made a very under the radar acquisition that I think will be huge for its model at scale. VoloMetrix provides organizational analytics that should allow Microsoft customers to better manage human capital and to optimize knowledge worker productivity - a uniform and huge concern at every level. This tech will make Microsoft an early mover in a niche in its infancy and one that I believe will be defensive once aggregated. This tech also should embellish the value prop of the overall productivity suite, especially Power BI. This is just one more perfectly fitting acquisition for Satya Nadella's New Microsoft which is working toward a one-platform productivity model. Almost every single day when I'm scouring the internet for Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) news I find something that further impresses me about the company and about the new direction the company is taking. I've covered Microsoft for Seeking Alpha pretty intensely since Satya Nadella took control and I've been consistently astonished by the overall reshaping and the turnaround of generally everything. Yes, everything. Even when Microsoft was forced to write down the massive failure that was Nokia (a former CEO Steve Ballmer misstep to be sure) it was done with a purpose in mind and a general direction. No longer does Microsoft seem like a hodge-podge collection of ideas and products, a rudderless ship at sea. The company now with its focused initiatives and its clear plan of execution has done extremely well to further its vision of becoming a "one-platform" productivity company. The news of its VoloMetrix acquisition, to which financial terms have not been disclosed, should only further the company down the road to where it's already heading. Don't overlook this small roll-up - it's going to matter in a big way very soon. VoloMetrix is a four and a half year old "organizational analytics" startup. VoloMetrix uses data gathered from knowledge worker productivity systems (read: the type of platforms that Microsoft sells under its general productivity suite umbrella - email, calendar, etc.) to "transform knowledge worker productivity through data, transparency and feedback loops (SOURCE: VoloMetrix MSFT acquisition blog )." The value prop that VoloMetrix brought to its customers was that it could put a quantitative value or measurement on how employees/teams were driving outcomes for their company - a hugely meaningful value-add at that. The use cases here aren't endless but they're all Human Capital ( HC )/knowledge worker optimization based and HC is a huge overhead cost for most enterprises. Largely, it's one of the biggest "fixed" costs within an operating model. With VoloMetrix companies can work to optimize HC while also furthering optimization of organizational HC management from a productivity standpoint. Put simply, VoloMetrix can help answer the questions of not "who should we hire?" as HCM would, but "where should we have our best workers spend their time?/where are our weakest workers lagging and how can we optimize production?/etc." That really, really matters when you have thousands of employees that are expected to create billions of dollars of market cap. Heck, it matters when you only have a handful of employees but each is paramount to your livelihood. I could go on about the value that VoloMetrix brings to the SMB/enterprise but I think the point is made here. Microsoft customers should be really, really happy to know that VoloMetrix help is on the way. They should be even happier to know how VoloMetrix is going to be deployed. Microsoft plans to not offer VoloMetrix's tech as a standalone solution but integrated within Office 365. From this integration Microsoft will have a significant buildout of its Delve Organizational Analytics tech/platform which is expected to be a quasi-BI that runs autonomously in the background of the broader productivity suite. Delve will be able to do exactly what VoloMetrix has been able to do for its customers, now having acquired VoloMetrix, only with seamless and perfect integration. Think the difference between "content pack" and native. From a speed and overall breadth of analysis standpoint that matters as well. So, let's tie it altogether. Microsoft now gets what I would call a best of breed technology (albeit a young breed of technology) to help build out a technology/platform (Delve) that I can only presume wouldn't have been as good without it. Microsoft also gets a major productivity and optimization value-add to pitch to potential customers which are already being pitched on productivity and optimization. You could say that's pretty synergistic to the overall sales model at Microsoft, I would. Further, Microsoft gets more data, more BI, and a potential new vertical for selling its overall standalone BI platform Power BI. Finally, Microsoft gets an overall model overlay that it can continue to find ways to drop into its model over the mid-term, an overlay that is addressing a need that's uniform across its customer base and an overlay that's attacking a niche that's in its infancy. Guys, again, don't overlook how big this is and how big this can be. Just because the technology was coming from a startup doesn't mean it can't and won't be hugely meaningful when scaled up into the massive ecosystem Microsoft immediately brings to the table. I think Microsoft is getting a huge first mover advantage in this niche and like other disruptive tech productivity techs (think CRM platforms or Inbound Marketing platforms) I also think that's going to be huge in aggregating a customer base that can be retained. I think in this particular niche, and I alluded to this in a recent IBM note , the "learnings" taken from the data gathered and analyzed will be cumulative. To be clear, what I mean is that over time the system in place will have a definitive incumbent advantage in that it will have a history of readings and "coaching" suggestions given as well as a collection of outcomes derived from those readings. The general point is that as with CRM and other actionable, smart, data-heavy systems of record the "switching costs" of changing systems of record grows with time. That understanding could be part of the reason Microsoft is willing to get out ahead of the curve on this niche, something that it hasn't been willing to do regularly throughout its history. Of course, this could just be yet another cultural evolution put in place by Satya Nadella, one that favors innovation and measured risk taking. Regardless, I'm bullish this acquisition and I hope analysts on the next earnings call make this a point of focus. I think this could have very wide ranging implications.
