Microsoft: Leading The Next Evolution In CRM With Gamification - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft has turned to the upcoming Gamification niche in an effort to find innovation and differentiation for its Dynamics CRM. Microsoft has also left open the door, however, for its new Gamification acquisition to be integrated into competing CRM platforms as well - a strategy shift from days of old. I believe Gamification is the next evolution of CRM and quite possibly non-CRM platforms - Microsoft will do well to lead the way. Microsoft's purchase of Incent Games is a clear execution on all three Satya Nadella outlined strategic initiatives and speaks well to the cultural shift taking place at the company. I've often expressed to Seeking Alpha tech investors the importance of closely following the private tech markets. I've said before that the private markets are a literal farm system for the public markets in that the best tech from the private side, where 99% of the space's innovation takes place, becomes the next valuation driver on the public side. That's if the private side outperformer doesn't decide to itself come public ( Square is going to be the next great example) in which case you're going to want to have followed the IPO closely from as far back as possible anyways. It just makes sense. In following the private tech markets (and I have an unfair advantage in that I consult private tech startups) I noticed a particular trend of startups popping up (from the usual hotspots of Austin, San Francisco, Seattle, and from the new hotspots in Asia) that were also seeing what I would deem irregular traction at very early stage of development. These startups all were involved in the Gamification niche - or put simply, turning tasks into games. Now, you might be thinking about companies of the Foursquare ilk but you'd have it all wrong. The new gamification companies are sharper, better interfaced, more flexible, and much, much more mature (if you will). It was in this observation that I opined in a HubSpot (NYSE: HUBS ) article that the company buy best of breed gamification startup Playbasis . I thought, at the time, that HubSpot should add Playbasis in that Playbasis could improve the engagement and therefore efficacy of its broader Inbound Marketing platform. Now, in light of HubSpot's announcement that it has taken its CRM out of beta and into general use, I believe a Playbasis acquisition makes even more sense. Gamification being infused with CRM makes complete and obvious sense in that the more CRM is used, the higher level of efficacy CRM shows. This data is apparent and widely accepted in the tech/sales industries regardless of which CRM is being deployed - the arguments only begin at which CRM is best at driving efficacy. Apparently, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), which itself has a CRM engine in Dynamics CRM, agrees with me on all accounts. On August 3rd, 2015, Microsoft announced the acquisition of Austin-based Gamification startup Incent Games. Incent Games developed and sells flagship product FantasySalesTeam. FantasySalesTeam is a gamification engine/platform that does exactly what I was promoting that Playbasis does. It incentivizes users to hit milestones via a game-like achievement tracking system. In this instance one that is similar to that of many fantasy sports platforms. Microsoft intends to drop FantasySalesTeam into Dynamics CRM to do exactly what I thought HubSpot could do - increase engagement and drive efficacy. Microsoft also, in a rare move by the company, has left open FantasySalesTeam for integration into other competing CRM's including that offered by salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM ). Now, in buying Incent Games Microsoft accomplishes three key strategies in one acquisition. I also believe the purchase is evidence of the Satya Nadella regime's sweeping cultural changes which might be the more important broader implication of the purchase. The two concepts, however, are intertwined and hard to separate which is yet another positive of the new-Microsoft. I'll explain. Microsoft has made a serious and concentrated effort to do three things since new CEO Satya Nadella took the top position at the company. One - to become a single, unified technology platform, two - to not alienate users and non-users by forcing all platform activity to come from Microsoft branded tech, and three - to be an innovator. Again, the company does all three with the seemingly small implication acquisition of Incent Games. Microsoft does further unify its "one platform" by increasing the value-add of its CRM with the FantasySalesTeam integration. An increased take rate for its CRM could lead to an increased take rate for its productivity suite. An increased take rate for the productivity suite could lead to an increased take rate for its Power BI. So on and so on. Microsoft isn't going to alienate non-Dynamics CRM users by forcing them to switch to have access to FantasySalesTeam. In keeping open the integration channels, Microsoft is keeping open the possibility to introduce users of salesforce.com's CRM to a Microsoft product and/or allowing say a user of its productivity suite and salesforce.com's CRM (put simply a dual salesforce.com and a Microsoft customer) access to both products he or she wants without forcing switching of any kind. This is a vastly different approach than that used during the Ballmer era. Microsoft is showing a cultural shift in that it realizes it can't be all things to all people. Yet another underlying cultural theme pivot under Nadella that wasn't there under Ballmer. Finally, Microsoft has chosen to lead with innovation in buying Incent Gaming rather than wait for established norms to drive its decision making. The latter has led Microsoft to a stagnant market cap and to poor "innovation chasing" moves which most recently led to a $7 billion write down. The company would like to avoid those mistakes going forward. Microsoft is willing to take a chance on helping drive adoption of broader gamification integration and in its risk will likely see a market share capture if successful. Also, Microsoft noted in a blog post announcing the Incent Gaming purchase that it would look for other, non-CRM deployment options for FantasySalesTeam. Could this mean, as Playbasis has pioneered, an ability for Microsoft Dynamics CRM customers to allow their customers use of FantasySalesTeam? If so, look for Playbasis to be the next name to be taken off the board as it's the only other name I'm aware of that offers this as a service that makes sense for customers' customers. We'll have to see what Microsoft has in the works as FantasySalesTeam optimizes integration. So, all told I think this purchase is meaningful to the Microsoft story and for that matter the broader CRM space as well. I believe the next innovation to take place in CRM is going to be Gamification and that the first movers are going to have a distinct advantage. What's interesting about the Gamification space, however, that might be partially negating to a CRM engine first-mover advantage is the wide differences between gamification engines. For instance, Incent Games' engine shares zero similarities with Playbasis' engine. In saying that, whichever delivery mechanism - for instance gamification via fantasy sports platform or via a more general reward platform (think: points, trophies, etc.) - that can show the greatest efficacy should prove out to create the CRM space's long-term gamification integration winner. In that, it might makes sense for a CRM platform owner (read: Microsoft) to acquire multiple gamification engines to provide optionality within its platform. This will be an interesting development to watch going forward. Source: Microsoft: Leading The Next Evolution In CRM With Gamification Disclosure: I am/we are long HUBS.
