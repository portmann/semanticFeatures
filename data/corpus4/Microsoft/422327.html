A Super Heavyweight AAA Boxing Match: Johnson & Johnson Vs. Microsoft - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha There are only two AAA-rated companies left now: Johnson & Johnson and Microsoft. We put up a financial boxing match between these two super heavyweight champions. The three boxing rounds: the dividend, ratios and value. The 27th of April marked the end of an era. ExxonMobile Corp. (NYSE: XOM ) was stripped of its pristine AAA-credit rating by Standard and Poor's. It had held that medal of excellence since 1930, but this oil bear market was too harsh, even for the best of companies, to get out unharmed. That means there are only two AAA-rated companies left now: Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ). These two juggernauts are in completely different sectors (healthcare and technology), but a lot of investors, especially those focused on income, have these stocks in their portfolio or on their watch list. They are as safe as can be and they are both qualified dividend growers. Let's put up a boxing match between those two giants to see which company would come out as the one and only company with an AAA+ (a special credit rating by From Growth to Value). This comparison will be put up like an Olympic (amateur) boxing match, which means that it will have three rounds of each three minutes (three components). Johnson and Johnson and Microsoft are often part of a DGI portfolio (dividend growth investing), which means that the dividend must be reliable, that the yield should be high enough and growing at an attractive pace. These are the three criteria (minutes) we are looking at in round 1. Both companies have a very reliable history of paying and increasing dividends. Johnson & Johnson is one of the 17 Dividend Kings, companies that have paid rising dividends for more than 50 years. In the case of JNJ: 54 years. I guess a lot of you were not even born in 1962 or didn't have a stock portfolio yet. JNJ Payout Ratio (NYSE: TTM ) data by YCharts As you can see, JNJ's payout ratio still leaves room for growth. Although is has gone up recently, it is still very safe at 54%. MSFT Payout Ratio ( TTM ) data by YCharts Now this is a graph most DGI don't want to see: a payout ratio of more than 100%. But don't worry, this is a one time exception. EPS for next year are expected to be $2.89, which would put the $1.44 dividend per share back at about a 50% payout ratio. Conclusion of the first minute of boxing: both boxers are doing well, but MSFT showed a short moment of weakness about the dividend payout. Currently the S&P500 yield stands at 2.14%. Both JNJ (2.70%) and MSFT (2.63%) are above average yielders. JNJ's yield is just above that of MSFT, but you could say they are almost identical. MSFT Dividend Yield ( TTM ) data by YCharts According to Yahoo Finance , JNJ has a 5 year average yield of 3.02%, so its current yield is historically a bit low. MSFT has a 5 year average yield of 2.59%, so its dividend is a bit higher than its historical average. This is of course because MSFT has a more recent dividend than JNJ and had to raise more to get even. Conclusion of minute two of the boxing match: both super heavyweights seem to keep each other in balance. Just a few percentage points lead for JNJ on yield. Of course, since MSFT only started a dividend 13 years ago, its dividend growth is higher than JNJ's. JNJ is growing its dividend very evenly at a pace of middle single digits. As a young dividend doggy, MSFT's raises are jumping higher and now are at 13.08% but seem to decelerate. Both companies are solid dividend plays, but MSFT is no match for JNJ's dividend history. There are no absolute truths in the stock market, but I think the reliability of JNJ's dividend is about as close to certainty as you can get. So in our triple A-fight, the first round is given for JNJ. Not with a wide margin, but like a champion that has everything under control against the challenger and has the advantage of the experience of having fought to defend the title before. But MSFT is doing great so far and JNJ has to look out for a blow in round 2 and 3. There are of course numerous ratios that are used by investors. But we will look at three. The P/E ratio is probably the most common and known to all investors, but I think P/FCF and ROE are at least as important as the P/E to determine the strength of our super heavyweights. The price to earnings ratio is maybe the simplest ratio there is, especially to evaluate value stocks such as MSFT and JNJ. As you can see on the graph below, JNJ's P/E is at 20.52 now. This seems a bit high compared with the last ten years: the average PE of JNJ is 18.96. JNJ PE Ratio ( TTM ) data by YCharts MSFT PE Ratio ( TTM ) data by YCharts As you can see, MSFT's P/E is a lot higher at 40.82. But last summer, Microsoft wrote down $7.6B related to its mobile phone business, which it had taken over from Nokia. Normally the P/E ratio would be more like in this FAST graph. This shows that MSFT's normal P/E ratio is 13.8, while it is 19.6 now. There is no shred of doubt: JNJ comes out as the winner here: MSFT has a weak moment. Even if you take into account the 'normalized' P/E, JNJ is closer to its average. But the picture should be made complete by also taking into account the forward P/E. This is of course less factual, because estimates of the earnings of the next year are involved, but for such widely followed companies as Microsoft and Johnson & Johnson, the estimates are often quite reliable. JNJ PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts At this moment, JNJ has a forward P/E ratio of 17.10, which is very high compared to the last ten years. Only at the end of 2014 the forward P/E ratio was higher than now. MSFT PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts Microsoft's forward P/E ratio is a lot more moderate than the ttm P/E ratio of 40. But here too, you can see that Microsoft is valuated very richly compared to the last ten years. Conclusion of the first minute of round 2: Both stocks seem to be inflated if you look at both the P/E and forward P/E ratio, which is higher than almost any moment in the last ten years. If I have to choose one of the two, it would be JNJ, because its ttm P/E ratio is closer to its historical average than MSFT's. The FCF (Free Cash Flow) is a very important metric: it determines how much money is left to distribute to shareholders, to buy back shares and to reinvest in the company. The price to FCF is the market capitalization divided by the free cash flow. The lower the outcome is, the better. This metric is often considered as being superior to the P/E ratio because you can not manipulate it as you can manipulate (especially non-GAAP) earnings. JNJ Price to Free Cash Flow ( TTM ) data by YCharts As you can see from the chart, Microsoft's P/FCF is at 18, which is lower than JNJ's 21.65. On the other hand, you could say that JNJ's P/FCF has historically been lower since the Great Depression of 2008-2009. In other words, the market values JNJ's FCF higher than MSFT's. What you can also see from the chart is that both companies have quite elevated P/FCF numbers compared to their recent history. The return on equity or ROE is a very important ratio to consider if you are a stockholder of a company. It is the income that a company can make on the shareholder's money. The higher the ROE, the more efficient a company is. A high ROE means more bang for the buck, you could say. The ROE depends of course on the sector the company operates in, but both the healthcare as the technology sector have traditionally high ROEs. So, let's just compare. JNJ Return on Equity ( TTM ) data by YCharts As you can see, JNJ's ROE is quite stable: mostly between 20 and 25%. MSFT's has had a very high ROE (more than 50%), but it has come down recently. Both companies have a quite high ROE if you look at their competitors. MSFT's 12.75% compares well to that of the software industry, which is 5.64%, according to gurufocus.com . JNJ's ROE is 21.7%, a lot higher than the major drugs manufacturers industry, which has a average ROE of 7.16%. Johnson & Johnson wins on the P/E, because it is a bit less overvalued compared to its own historical P/E, both trailing twelve months and forward. The ROE is a close call: MSFT's ROE has come down recently, but that is partly because of the amortization of its mobile phone department. But still, this counts and probably Microsoft will write down another $950M in the second quarter. If you compare the ROE with the industry median, MSFT outflanks the competition by 126%, but JNJ leaves the industry in the dust by 203%. And so the conclusion is clear: JNJ prevails in round 2, because it scores better on P/E and ROE. Round 3: Value (present, past, and future) You all know that price is what you pay, value is what you get. We will look at the present, past and future of the triple A stocks in round 3. The present is the present value you get, in other words: is the stock price attractive now to buy JNJ or MSFT? The performance is the past value: how much has it gone up? The future is the value that the stocks will get in ... the future. Valuation matters, of course. Your future return depends for a part on the valuation the moment you buy your stock. Is this historically a good time to buy JNJ or MSFT shares? If you take the current price of JNJ ($112.64) and you want to calculate its fair value according to the P/E ratio, you should divide the price by the current P/E and multiply by the average P/E ratio. You would get this: 112.69/20.49x18.96=104.23. According to this method JNJ's fair value would be $104.23, which makes that JNJ's stock is just slightly overvalued (by 7.5%). For MSFT we will be mild and we will not include the one-time amortization, which means that MSFT has a P/E ratio of 19.6. With a price of $52.32 this would be mean the average MSFT price (if you divide by 19.6 and multiply by 13.8) is $36.84, an overvaluation of 41%. (all ratios are familiar to most investors or can be looked up, except these: PL VL= Peter Lynch value= EPSx15; FV 1yr FG= fair value in 2017 according to FAST Graphs; US IV= Uncle Stock 's intrinsic value, average TP= average analysts' target price according to finviz.com ) As you can see, both companies seem to be overvalued according to the average of all these prices, but Microsoft is more overvalued than Johnson & Johnson, so JNJ wins this first 'minute' of the third round. As for the past performance, both companies have done a great job, especially if you have used the dividends to buy more shares (dripping). This is the result of the last ten years. Click to enlargeAs you can see, MSFT has outperformed JNJ. But if you would have bought MSFT just before the crisis, the outperformance would have been smaller. This is because JNJ's beta is lower than MSFT's: 0.79 versus 1.05. So the moment of buying determines your profit. If you would buy MSFT now and a new crisis would knock at the door pretty soon, the probability is rather high that JNJ outperforms MSFT. But what about a DRIP? Don't quit your daily job has a great tool to calculate your return if you would have dripped these (and other) stocks. (As a side note: I always take $1000 as a starting amount and not $10.000. I have explained why here .) So, as you can see, MSFT wins both for the capital gains as for the DRIP investing. Minute 2 of round 3 goes to MSFT. Of course predicting the future is often difficult and uncertain. It also has a qualitative side and a quantitative side. The quantitative aspect is the part where the earnings growth, earnings multiples, the analysts' consensuses, share buybacks and future dividends all belong, besides much more numbers. For JNJ, you can find them for example here , here and here ; for MSFT, you can read about quantitative aspects here , here and here . The qualitative aspect is what specialists see as the future in the long run. It comments on questions such as: Will there be new possibilities for the company to extend their product range? How is the company positioned compared to competitors? Both themes alone (qualitative and quantitative) are the subject of many articles here on S.A. For MSFT, you can find interesting qualitative articles here , here and here for example, for JNJ here (a very good first article, Mark!), here and here . Of course a lot of articles mix the two: qualitative and quantitative. So how looks the future of JNJ and MSFT? I think both of these companies have a great future ahead, both with their strengths and weaknesses. And there will be a lot of articles and comments on details that could be important for the future of these wonderful companies. I don't want to choose on the future aspect between JNJ and MSFT. You could bring up positive and negative arguments for both. Maybe you want to comment on either or both companies' future? Please feel free to post your idea in the comment section! It was a close call: the future is a tie, MSFT won the overall past return, but JNJ is closer to its fair value than MSFT. This last item is more important than the past, so JNJ wins narrowly. Round 1 (the dividend) was won by JNJ because of its superb dividend track. Round 2 (the ratios) was also for JNJ, but only slightly. Round 3 (value) was won by JNJ because it is probably less overvalued than MSFT. So the conclusion is clear: In the fight of the two AAA super heavyweight champions, both showed why they are considered to be champions. It was a fight between two worthy opponents. But the special From Growth to Value AAA+ label goes to JNJ. If you liked this article, feel free to click the "follow" button.
