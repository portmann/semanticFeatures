Buy Intel At 4% Yield - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Our hunt for another technology stock continues. Fundamental analysis can aid in picking the right options chain. We've been writing a series of articles about selling puts to buy dividend-paying stocks at a particular price. As we've mentioned in previous articles , the most rewarding aspect of writing on Seeking Alpha is hearing from readers that they learned something new from an article. That feeling gets better when you discover a reader's perspective has changed on a particular strategy - in this case, options in general and selling puts in specific. So, if the readers have learned something already, why continue the series? Two reasons: One, we cover different stocks, look at their respective chains and pick a strike and premium that make sense fundamentally as well. Two, this series has also been used as a means to find the second technology stock for our portfolio besides Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). So far, Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) have been profiled among technology stocks. Now it's time to look at another "old-tech" stock, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) and its option chain. Please refer to this article to recap the basics of selling puts. An Example: Below is Intel's option chain, which expires on Jan. 20, 2017. Let's pick the $28 put for example. For selling one contract (one contract = 100 shares), you need to have a cash balance of $2,800 in your account ($28 per share times 100 shares in a contract) to cover the possible purchase of 100 shares of Intel. The premium on this particular put is likely to be between $2.20 and $2.30 per contract depending on the day. That would net you a premium of say $230 for one contract. #1: Intel is well above $28 at the time of expiration. Your option expires worthless and you net a cool 8% for about 10 months of your willingness to set aside $2,800 on this contract. Remember, your $2,800 is not locked up with Intel beyond this point. This trade gives you more than double the current yield Intel offers for buying shares. Risk: If Intel really rockets up from here, your option returns will be lower than the stock returns. This may happen, but given this stock's history, it has a habit of being range bound for an extended period of time. Intel investors will remember the mid $20s range the stock was stuck in for years on. #2: Intel is at or below $28, and you are obligated to buy 100 shares at $28. Remember, you already netted $2.30 per share when you sold the put. So, your cost basis is essentially $28-$2.30 = $25.70. As long as Intel is above this $25.70, you will have a net positive return when this option chain expires. Risk: The risk in this scenario is that if Intel really tanks in the next 10 months and trades below $28, you will still have to buy your shares at $28. Intel has been increasing dividends almost every single year since 2004. But the company broke one of the commandments of dividend growth investing when it paid the same annual dividend of 90 cents per share in both 2013 and 2014. But it at least maintained the dividend without reducing or eliminating even for one quarter. The dividends have since been increased twice, going up from 90 cents a year to 96 cents a year to $1.04. Given how the current payout ratio is at 44%, we expect Intel to announce another dividend increase in November of this year. Going by the last two increases (6% and 8%), we are optimistic about a 7% increase this year. That would give Intel a yield of 3.97% if you must buy shares at $28 when this chain expires next year. As can be seen here , Intel has had a yield above 4% only for a few days in the last five years. If the chain expires worthless, you'd still be left with your 8% return. A win-win. Based on the 2017 EPS estimate of $2.65, a purchase at $28 would represent a multiple of 10. That's well below the average multiple of 12 that the stock has traded at in the recent years . On the business front, things are looking up as well. A recent SA News piece indicated Intel is likely to supply up to 40% of the modems in Apple's upcoming iPhone 7. While Intel's revenue will go up a notch or two because of this in the short term, the fact that Intel is now foraying into Qualcomm's (NASDAQ: QCOM ) kingdom is the one to watch in the long term. Intel also expects its data center business to grow at 15% per year, a high target. But even if the company manages anywhere close to 10% here, it'd be a big win, as data center chips tend to have higher margin . With the explosive growth in cloud, expect more companies to jump onto the data center business. Irrespective of which cloud company wins, Intel is likely to provide its share of data center chips to all the competitors. Analysts are starting to note this obviously, as this upgrade suggests. To summarize, Intel is definitely another candidate we are evaluating for our portfolio. Microsoft still leads but Intel and Cisco are going neck to neck. To conclude the article, we'd like to list out the frequent comments and scenarios posted by readers in this series so far. Using the premium against the sale: Not all brokers seem to require you to set aside the entire $2,800 to be able to sell one contract at the strike price of $28. Some readers commented that their brokers let them execute the trade by subtracting the premium. For example, if the premium for the contract is supposed to be $230, some brokers allow you to sell one contract if you have $2,570 in your account. Our experience has always been to set aside the full amount but it's important to note this feedback from the readers. Option Expiration: Some readers suggested buying/selling "closer" chains than one year out. That is, a chain that expires in three months for example. Yes, it can be done for a lower premium but the option to use your capital elsewhere after the chain expires. In short, many ways to do it, pick the one you are most comfortable with. We like six month-to-one-year contracts, as they give us more wiggle room. Covered Calls: Covered calls seem to be preferred by some readers as well. This is generally a good way to enhance your income if you own shares already. We don't do this as often as selling puts and do not feel comfortable preaching something we don't do often. Buying outright but at what cost? Some prefer just buying the shares outright and not messing with options. Obviously, this is the most used method, but not every investor likes to buy a stock at any price the market gives. Some prefer a particular entry point even if it's the best stock and this strategy works for such investors to pick a time and price for their shares. Margin: Some brokers allow some investors to go on margin - that is borrowing money from the broker to execute your trade. But "margin-call" is one of the most hated terms in the options world. This happens when the broker demands additional money to meet the minimum maintenance margin. We suggest the average reader/investor try cash-secured puts first before getting into the murky world of margin. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
