Can Microsoft Rise Again? - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft can rise again, but not until 2016 at the earliest. Windows is failing, but HoloLens and the cloud are coming to take its place. Since taking over role of CEO at Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) on February 4, 2014, Satya Nadella has seen shareholders' hope turn to dust. The stock is up nearly 6.5% since then, but the S&P index is up almost 16% during the same period. The trend since the start of the year has been almost straight down - a loss of 13% taking nearly $40 billion off the market cap. Microsoft next reports earnings on April 23, with the " whisper number " of 52 cents/share in earnings coming in well below the 68 cents per share earned for the same quarter last year. Expectations, in short, are muted. Is an upside surprise possible? It's more likely a downside one. The company's problems are easy to see. Just go looking at PCs. Most PCs running Windows these days retail at $500, and you can get many for less. When it comes to retail pricing, Microsoft is presently in a race to the bottom of the pricing pyramid with the Google ( GOOG , GOOGL ) Chromebook. Its best hope for getting its average selling price up is the Surface Pro 3 - a $1,000 machine it has manufactured itself that has drawn decent reviews, but hasn't exactly drawn a flood of buyers. In contrast, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) just announced its latest MacBook at $1,300, and its desktop units can cost $2,000 or more, give or take. Apple can barely keep these models in stock, while the dirt-cheap Microsoft product languishes on the shelves. Microsoft has some hope for Windows 10, but that is still in public beta, and won't be officially released until the middle of the year. As a show of just how far behind the company has fallen, Microsoft has promised free upgrades for a year to owners of Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 machines. This means any financial benefits from the launch won't show up until the third quarter, and it's more likely any big money won't come in for another year after that. It's also possible it won't come in at all. Note that the future of the Windows Phone line is also tied to Windows 10 - the desktop and phone operating systems will be the same. Microsoft's Azure cloud is doing fairly well, but while the company claims to bring in more revenue on it than Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) does on its AWS cloud, it's an apples-to-oranges comparison, since Microsoft is comparing software revenue to pure cloud infrastructure. The product roadmap for 2015 is littered with upgrades to existing software and a serious effort to work with open source , which could include an open source version of Windows itself . Again, great for customers, great for users - not so great for the vendor. Microsoft is moving its enterprise development to the cloud, and this could hit IBM Corp. (NYSE: IBM ) hard - but it won't mean a big increase in revenues. Its Xbox is still a hit, but gaming too is moving to the cloud - even the day of the big game machine may be over. Microsoft keeps showing it knows 3D, and HoloLens could finally take the technology mainstream - but again, don't expect bottom line results until 2016, at the earliest. All of which makes 2015 a year of transition for Microsoft. Negative surprises are more likely than positive ones. It went into the year with Windows and Office, and it may come out with games, HoloLens and Cloud. The success of all the new stuff is speculative, however, and the losses are baked into the cake. If you want to sit on your Microsoft position and wait for the future, you're welcome to it. But I think you're much better off in tech companies that are winning right now.
