Are Google Investors Too Exuberant Before Apple Introduces Its Next iPhone? - Google Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) | Seeking Alpha Have Google investors considered potential losses of default search engine revenues on mobile and PCs? Microsoft has replaced Google as the Default Search Engine on Windows 10. At the time of writing this article Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) is trading near all-time highs. Investors cheered its most recent earnings report. Investors also appeared to like the company's planned reorganization into Alphabet, a newly named company where investors will have further clarity into the performance of various Google segments. However, with an Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPhone announcement imminent, I wonder if this enthusiasm may be over-exuberant. Imagine a shake-up in the search industry where another player becomes the company where advertisers must go to reach many iPhone users. There have been many reports that Apple's search deal with Google expires this year. On September 23, 2010, Bloomberg reported that Google's then-CEO Eric Schmidt said in an interview that the search deal with Apple was "recently extended." To date, I have seen no public document indicating whether Google and Apple have renewed their search agreement. I believe for multiple reasons that the answer to this question will be revealed when Apple introduces its next iPhone prior to its release. Forbes has reported that the next iPhone will be released on September 18, 2015. First, although the 2010 Bloomberg report didn't give details of the terms of any agreement renewal, it seems that the deal has historically been renewed some time during or before September. So the upcoming release of the iPhone is vaguely close to at least one anniversary of a prior renewal. Second, if there is a new default search engine, the ideal time to introduce it would be at the time of the introduction of the new iPhone. This is because Apple competes with Google's Android operating system, and has a history of dropping Google products when it can. Examples include when Apple created its own mapping system to replace Google Maps and removed Google-owned YouTube from the iOS home screen. If Apple has a goal of convincing people not to switch from a new default search engine back to Google, Apple needs to sell the new search engine to the public and tech media as being better. Since Apple publicly demonstrates products at its keynotes, it is logical that any change to iOS affecting future iPhones (and iPads) be introduced with the introduction of the next iPhone. Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) recently updated its mobile search engine, which Engadget described in June of this year as "looking a lot like" Google. Last year, Yahoo made a deal with Mozilla to become the default search engine on the Firefox browser. In Yahoo's July second quarter video conference call , CEO Marissa Mayer stated: "We've been really thrilled with our partnership with Mozilla. It was a profitable deal right away in Q1, which you often don't see with such a large partner, and it remained profitable in Q2." During a conference video call in January, Mayer responded to a question about a potential Safari deal by saying: "The Safari users are among the most engaged and lucrative users in the world and it's something that we would really like to be able to provide." In Yahoo's 10-Q filed on August 7, 2015 , the company provided interesting information with respect to its search deal with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ). Specifically, "...on or after October 1, 2015, either the Company or Microsoft may terminate the Search Agreement by delivering a written notice of termination to the other party. The Search Agreement will remain in effect for four months from the date of the termination notice to provide for a transition period..." This timing is interesting as it is within weeks of the reported next iPhone release date. Yahoo's 10-Q also states: "...the Company will now have the ability in response to queries on both personal computers and mobile devices to request algorithmic listings only, paid listings only or both algorithmic and paid listings from Microsoft." So for those who think Microsoft has better search technology in America, or elsewhere, it appears that Yahoo has the ability to use Microsoft's algorithms. Further, Yahoo has four months to transition out of its agreement with Microsoft. So, if Yahoo became the default for iOS, it would perhaps have time to continue using Microsoft's algorithms until it further improved its own. Or, perhaps it could come to a further amended deal with Microsoft to use its algorithms. As noted above, Microsoft also has an ability to terminate its deal with Yahoo on October 1, 2015. Microsoft has demonstrated an interest in pursing search as its Bing search engine has recently become the default search engine of AOL (NYSE: VZ ). In Microsoft's July 21, 2015 Q4 conference call , CEO Satya Nadella, when commenting on search partnerships with Yahoo and Apple stated: "With advertising revenue growth of 21% year over year, Bing will transition to profitability in the coming fiscal year." I assume the Apple partnership referred to in that comment is the Siri-default search deal reported in June 2013. (Remember this date: it's important later in this article!) Microsoft's conference call did not reveal the specifics of Bing's previous losses. So we do not know exactly what it will take for Bing to become profitable, although its CEO saying that it "will" be profitable seems pretty confident. However, very importantly, Bing is the default search engine of Edge , the new default browser on the recently-released Windows 10. So, if Apple really wanted to stick it to Google, it could make Bing the iOS default search engine. Advertisers who wanted to advertise on PCs, iPhones, or iPads would have to pay Microsoft instead of Google to reach anyone that kept the default search engines. As mentioned at the start of this article, Apple has historically removed Google products from iOS when it can. This is presumably because it views Google as a powerful competitor. Microsoft has also demonstrated, through Windows 10, that it obviously prefers that people use its own search engine over Google. As mentioned, Yahoo says its deal with Mozilla is profitable, which means that the traffic acquisition costs Yahoo is paying Mozilla are worth it. Presumably this is because a sufficient number of Firefox users are sticking with the default Yahoo search instead of switching back to Google. One can imagine how many Windows users will stick with Bing on Windows 10. However if Apple gives Microsoft iOS default, Bing could be an advertising powerhouse on PCs and on mobile. Further, as mentioned above, Microsoft reportedly became the Siri default search in June 2013. Months later, in September 2013, Microsoft acquired Nokia's mobile phone business. In Microsoft's most recent earnings report , $888 million in revenue came from Microsoft's iPad competitor, Surface. It seems that when Apple gave Microsoft default search on Siri it was far less of a hardware competitor to Apple. From a strategic point of view, if Apple is interested in weakening Google, giving search business to Microsoft would greatly strengthen another direct competitor. In contrast, Yahoo does not produce hardware or Android. If Apple wants to weaken its competitors, it seems that convincing people of the positive merits of a Yahoo iOS default would support that cause better than continuing its agreement with Google as iOS default, or giving default to Microsoft. I have read various analyst commentary on the potential impact of a loss of iOS default by Google. According to Apple Insider, a UBS analyst stated Google will obtain $7.8 billion in revenue from its search deal with Apple this year, or 10% of its gross revenue. That article estimated a 50% switchback rate in determining that the impact on Google, including costs previously paid to Apple to be the default search engine, would only reduce Google net revenue by about 3%. Apple stated at its most recent World Wide Developers Conference that Apple Maps usage to Google Maps usage on iOS devices is about 3.5 to 1. Yahoo has told us that enough users have not switched the default on Firefox for Yahoo default to remain profitable. A potential loss of iOS default should be considered with the impact of a Bing Windows 10 default. If Google's iOS and Windows search queries decline, then it makes sense that advertisers will go elsewhere to buy ads previously purchased on Google. In other words, Google may no longer be the automatic go-to place for advertising on PCs or mobile. As such a scenario would provide Google with an incentive to focus on other segments, like YouTube, Google investors may want to consider the timing of its latest Alphabet announcement.
