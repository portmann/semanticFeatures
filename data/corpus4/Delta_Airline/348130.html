On The Ground: March IRA Wrap-Up | Seeking Alpha March started off as a busy month in my IRA, as I documented in my previous article . I had both my Altria (NYSE: MO ) and General Motors (NYSE: GM ) positions assigned, and I wrote Cash Secured Equity Puts ("CSEPs") to generate income while waiting for my price point. Merck & Co. (NYSE: MRK ) went ex-dividend, and I successfully rolled out. Amid a quickly rising market closely associated with the recovery in oil process, the FOMC announced an extremely dovish report last Wednesday and, as a result, equities (especially those we dividend investors follow) took off. The upside, of course, is that my CSEPs are all well out of the money. And the downside is that all my CSEPs are well out of the money. My Consolidated Edison (NYSE: ED ) May 20 $65 contracts, for example, by more than $10.00. ConEd at $75? What?! Ten bucks past previous highs around $65 in 2012 and 2013. Morningstar has fair value at $59.00, S&P Capital IQ has fair value at $60.90 and a Strong Sell rating. Who'd have ever thought to see a "strong sell" on a major utility? I'd like to own ConEd with a yield north of 4%, so at the current dividend level that's a share price under $67.00. And that leads to my emerging problem. The front month puts at that level (actually $67.50) don't even show a bid. And May ain't all that great either, with a bid of 30¢ for the same contract. With the quarterly dividend at 67¢, CSEPs are no longer a reasonable alternative to owning the stock. My current set of ConEd CSEPs expires April 15. At that point I'll have to re-evaluate my "Utilities" position. Darn it, I want to own ConEd and the rest. So come on, Mr. Market, let's see a little correction here. When I first started this portfolio I wanted to establish 8 to 10 roughly equal positions, and I allocated funds to achieve that. Since then I've realized that a somewhat "safer" approach in terms of income is to allocate positions to achieve roughly equal dividend income from each. My target for each position is $1,400 annually. Currently my positions look like this: As you can see, I'm underweight ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM ) by about 100 shares, General Mills (NYSE: GIS ) by 50% (see below) and overweight HCP, Inc. (NYSE: HCP ) by about 200 shares. Of course the "0" positions are represented by CSEPs. I've already bored you with my rant about Consolidated Edison, so I'll skip the same for the other two. In addition to these nine positions I'd like to add one more, a topic I'll go into in more detail in another article. Verizon Communications, Inc. (NYSE: VZ ) At the start of the day VZ looked like a good rollout candidate. Unfortunately, telecom doesn't have the volatility of the oil patch (see XOM below). Three factors led me to let my Verizon shares be assigned: There were no attractive strikes in reasonably near term series I would realize a$1.50 a share gain if assigned I was slightly over weight income from Verizon At 709.0274 shares the Verizon position would have been generating $1602.40. By reducing the position to 609.0274 shares it generates $1376.40. With Verizon's ex date coming up on April 6 I needed to re-enter the position at 600 shares if I want to snag that dividend. Morningstar has fair value at $50.00 so it's about 6% over priced right now. Not ridiculous (like ED) but it could be better. With that ex-date coming up front month (April) near the money calls risk early assignment on April 5. The May $55 strike however looked interesting: It's well out of the money and the delta of .241 suggests it's in little danger of being in the money anytime soon. So I decided to place a buy/write order at a net debit of $53.00. The order was filled about an hour later, so now my Verizon position is back to paying dividends at the level I want it. As things stand right now my position of 609.0274 shares will pay a quarterly dividend of $344.10. The April dividend (paid May 2), re-invested, will bring the annual payout up to about $1,391.03 - right where I want it. ExxonMobil gapped up big time on the 18th, to over $2.00 in the money at the open. It started to fall almost immediately and was only about 85¢ ITM by 11:00. It caught a bid at that point so I decided to try placing an order to roll out to the April $82.50 strike. Ultimately I reduced my credit limit to $1.00 and got filled at $1.03 for a net gain including commission and fees $396.83. With my cost basis at $78.80 I'll be happy to keep rolling this out as long as oil patch volatility will let me make a buck a share every month. In keeping with my income allocation plan I intend to add another 100 shares of XOM to bring its dividend income up to $1460.00. The next ex date isn't until early May so I have plenty of time to find a good entry point. With Morningstar's fair value at $92.00 I can pull the trigger pretty much any time at the current levels. At more than $4.00 in the money there was no reason to try to roll out these $57.50 calls. Given that I had a cost basis of $54.46 I let them be assigned and happily took my $3.04 profit per share for a $1510.42 net gain. I'd like to own General Mills but not at $61.79. Morningstar has fair value at $57.00, so this is another place I'll be looking for a pullback. Maybe around $58 and a 3% or so yield. To meet my income goal, I'll need about 800 shares. At this time, I'm not comfortable allocating that much cash ($46,400) to GIS CSEPs. Rather than commit that much cash I decided to open half a position with a buy/write using the May $62.50 contract for a net debit of $60.40. That's a little expensive for the "Big G" so I'll be watching for a pull back to the mid to upper $50 range to add to my position. If it's in the money when the April ex dividend date (April 5th) rolls around, the May date should protect it from early exercise. This was the most exciting position for the month. By 10:30 it was only 11¢ out of the money, so I could be pretty sure I'd have to keep a close eye on it later in the day. Sure enough, as the day went on it moved closer and closer to my $83.50 strike price. By about 3:40 it was within a couple cents so I decided to go ahead and roll out and up to the April 22 $84.00 contract for a net premium of $356.89. As it turned out PG closed at only $83.15! Right about the same time I rolled out there appeared to be tremendous selling pressure that continued into after hours trading. Volume on the day was over 33 million shares; triple the average with half coming near or just after the close. This is another position that needs an increased allocation. In this case only 100 shares. With a Morningstar fair value at $90.00 pretty much any price in the low $80s is pretty good. With the price falling I decided to simply place a limit order at $83.00 for the additional 100 shares. Of course, the minute I placed the order the price started to rise, hitting 83.60 by 11:00. That order expired at the end of the day without being filled but I was filled at $53.00 on Tuesday. It's since fallen back a little, but by cents, not dollars. This was quite a month, and the income from activities shows it. While I'd greatly prefer not to be assigned, it is a standard feature of the strategy I'm using. So how did I do? Option premium income was greatly reduced due to the number of assignments, which, not surprisingly, greatly increased the net gain. The big missing item of course was dividend income due to the fact that only a tiny blob of DRIP shares represents ED. Although XOM paid its dividend my purchase missed the ex-date. At the close of March 21, my positions looked like this: All in all, things are pretty good. I'll be on vacation during April expiration, but at this point it looks like the only position I might have to address is a roll out of XOM. I'd be perfectly happy to have MO and GM put to me of course. Identify a 10th position in an unrelated sector. Disclosure: I am/we are long ED, PG, GIS, VZ, XOM, GM, HCP, MO, MRK.
