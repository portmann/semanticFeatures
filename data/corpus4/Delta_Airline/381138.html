Apple Stock Slides On News It Cuts iPhone Production By 30% Due To Sluggish Sales: Nikkei | Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! Each additional â€œbiteâ€? from the pie pushes the market closer to the edge. How many bites are left in the pie?

Don't expect any optimistic emails from Tim Cook to Jim Cramer for a long time, because according to a just released report in Japan 's Nikkei, Apple will continue its reduced production of iPhones in the April-June period in light of sluggish sales, according to parts suppliers notified of the plan. The website reports that slow sales of the flagship iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, which debuted last autumn, have forced Apple to adjust inventories. It lowered production for the January-March quarter by about 30% from the year-earlier period. With sales still sluggish, the U.S. company has told parts suppliers in Japan and elsewhere that it will maintain the reduced output level in the current quarter. Apple apparently does not plan to produce a large enough volume of the small iPhone SE released last month to offset the slump of its flagship series. However, should Apple decide to release its next flagship model earlier than the usual September launch, parts production for that smartphone could take off around late May. A prolonged production cut would hurt Japanese parts suppliers such as liquid crystal display panel manufacturers Japan Display and Sharp, memory chip supplier Toshiba and Sony, which provides image sensors for cameras. With their plants already operating at reduced rates, they may be forced to downgrade their earnings forecasts for the April-June quarter. The current production cut could last longer than the one Apple implemented in 2013. Some 1.5 billion smartphones are shipped globally in a year, but the market's growth is slowing.

What happened to the good ole days when we played with each other, or played with ourself.  No app to replace a good bang session.

We have to ask ourselves a question what we can do about it HERE AND NOW. We all know that the ship is going down but the music keeps playing but what we should be thinking about is how not to be swept by the wave of bad consequences developed world indebtedness, bubbles in many corners of market and war on cash. Playing a bear against central banks may be very hard on the other hand, prolonging this binge QE-driven bubbles equals meeting a wall sooner or later.  http://independenttrader.org/is-time-to-short-already-here.html Fri, 04/15/2016 - 13:19 | 7440123 skinwalker The wife bought an SE. She used her own money so I can't yell at her. I'll stick with my flip phone myself.  Fri, 04/15/2016 - 13:43 | 7440223 KnuckleDragger-X Fri, 04/15/2016 - 13:12 | 7440084 williambanzai7 This of course happens every time they get ready to launch a new flagship model like the 7 which is supposedly coming this year.

It's called a flip phone. The battery lasts more than an hour, you can actually make calls with it, and you don't have people bugging you every femtosecond with some irrelevant text or email or other garbage.  Fri, 04/15/2016 - 13:17 | 7440117 TradingIsLifeBrah I'm always amazed when people are surprised that a new iPhone will be released (those people being the News Media).  Every year at the same time in September Apple releases a new phone yet within 6 months of release the news forgets that it happens and is surprised that Apple is adjusting its supply chain to slow down builds on its old phones so that they can prepare for the new phone.  Apple's Days in Inventory for 2015 was ~6 days which is insane for a Hardware focused company.  Microsoft which is a lot less hardware focused has 27 Days in Inventory.  Why is anyone surprised that Apple would be managing down its inventory when its practically a master in Inventory Management? Fri, 04/15/2016 - 13:20 | 7440131 jus_lite_reading I've been talking to like, everybody and they all agree-- iPhone SE = iPhone C. Another epic fail. NOBODY is going to buy the SE model. Not even illegal immigrants want that lowly model! LMAO Fri, 04/15/2016 - 13:14 | 7440089 TradingIsLifeBrah Yawn, of course sales slow down now.  There is another iPhone to be released in the Fall.  Most people get the new phone not the old one if they want to upgrade.  The bigger "surprise" in a slowdown would have occurred in the December period end, March and June will always be a slowdown as Apple shifts production to the build of its new iPhone. In other news Apple is mining Gold now: Apple's recycling program is doing very well. As part of its annual environmental report that the company released yesterday, Apple declared that it had recovered nearly 90 million pounds of materials from Apple devices recycled through is program in 2015. Sixty-one million pounds of those materials are reusable in future products, including 2,204 pounds of gold, which Business Insider calculates is worth nearly $40 million. Apparently that iPhone disassembling robot was a good investment. Fri, 04/15/2016 - 13:14 | 7440095 E.F. Mutton Are you trying to say that no one wants a repackaged 5S at twice the price?  Or a $350 watch that does the same damn thing on a smaller screen? Fri, 04/15/2016 - 13:18 | 7440122 PPT Inc.

Mutton Yes.  Tim's "iPlug" idea didn't go over well outside of San Francisco focus groups.  Fortunately the rectal fires amongst beta-testers were rare and quickly hushed. Seriously STOP. If there's no news, don't try and make mountains out of mole hills.

Notice the Jan - Mar comment. The adjustment appears to have been completed. Fri, 04/15/2016 - 13:34 | 7440188 Hohum Fri, 04/15/2016 - 13:34 | 7440190 adr I've had the same phone for 4 years. An old Sony Flagship before the Experia Z I paid $1 for it at AT&T and then took it over to a non contract cell phone plan that costs me $30 a month for unlimited everything. The phone still lasts all day on a charge and can run everything it needs to. At some point the power of a new phone isn't needed unless the bloat of the OS ruins the performance. Kind of like every windows version past XP. My phone was better than the iPhone until the iPhone6. The screen resolution, processor, and camera were better than any previous iPhone. I also laugh at the people with cracked screens when my phone can survive any normal drop. Apple has been and always will be garbage with a premium price tag. The Chinese have woken up to that fact, now the rest of the world needs to. For the record, I think we've had peak iPhone and margins are going to start coming under pressure in the next 12 to 24 months and I'm interested in news that verifies or disproves that belief but c'mon ZH, enough with the HYSTERICS.
