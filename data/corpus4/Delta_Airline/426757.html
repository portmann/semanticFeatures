Boeing: What Does An Airline Pay For A Dreamliner? - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Production costs are likely to be $100 million under normal circumstances. Any analysis using $100 million as a revenue estimate is a flawed one. In one of my previous articles This Is How You Can Easily Make Things Look Bad For Boeing's Dreamliner , I had a look at the faulty interpretation of data and extrapolation that yields potential inaccurate results for Boeing's (NYSE: BA ) deferred costs totally flattening out. In some of my articles I also performed a sanity check to check whether Boeing's targets are realistic and attainable. Key to this feasibility or sanity check is an assumption for the revenue per aircraft. In this article I will have a look at what current market values are, what the influence of the delivery mix is to the revenue per aircraft and what revenues some analyses use. So before getting to the market value it is important to know the list prices of the airframes and realize that airlines usually get around 50% in standard discounts. Table 1: List prices 2015 for the Boeing 787 A 50% discount would imply a market value of $112.3 million for the Boeing 787-8, $132.3 million for the Boeing 787-9 and $153.1 million for the Boeing 787-10. The 50% discount is a rule of thumb, the actual market values are a few percentage points higher (lower discounts). AeroAnalysis had a look at a United Airlines (NYSE: UAL ) investor presentation and did some research to get an idea of the market value for aircraft, including the Boeing 787. The value of the Boeing 787-8 is between $117.9 million and $135.85 million, implying a 46%-37.8% discount compared to the 2014 list prices. With the Boeing 787-9 being a bigger success than the Boeing 787-8, I do expect the market value of the Boeing 787-8 to be closer to $118 million than to $135 million. Using today's list prices and a slight drop in value due to competitive pressure this means a discount of 46.0%-46.5%. For the Boeing 787-9 the market values are between $133.2 million and $157.7 million. I expect the market value to be at the lower end of this range, implying a 48.5%-49.0% discount. For the Boeing 787-10 not a lot of market valuations are available, but a 48.5% discount seems reasonable to me. This would indicate a market value of roughly $157.5 million. What can be concluded is that Boeing is a bit less flexible in discounting the Boeing 787-8, despite dropping demand for the aircraft. This likely has everything to do with the already tight margins for the aircraft. Boeing would rather sell the Boeing 787-9, which can give them more profit. Amidst pricing pressure from the Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSF ) A330neo and the Airbus A350, discounts for the other Boeing 787 models is between 46% and 49%, validating an assumption of 50% discount for the longer term. According to Leeham, quoted in The Herald Business Journal, Delta (NYSE: DAL ) was willing to pay $115 million per Boeing 787-9 when it was negotiating with Airbus and Boeing in 2014. This implies a 56.5% discount, whereas Boeing would not go any further than a discount of 53%. This shows that where airlines are considering the Airbus counterparts as serious candidates as well, Boeing's prices can be negotiated down by 52%-53%. Some analyses have been using a revenue assumption of $100 million - $105 million per airplane and gear their calculations and conclusions on Boeing's ability to recoup the deferred costs within the accounting block towards this assumption. I think that with Boeing's cheapest 787 model having a market value of $117 million and $105.6 when heavily discounted, this revenue assumption could not be any more flawed. One of the things to keep in mind is that the delivery mix is becoming more and more 787-9 oriented. Additionally, the Boeing 787-10 will have a positive contribution to the average revenue per airframe as well. Table 2: Estimated value for the Boeing 787 members The revenue per aircraft can be estimated using 2 methods. The first method is by using the 2016 delivery mix and the second method is by having a look at the backlog. The results are shown in Table 3. Table 3: Revenue assumption per aircraft What can be seen is that the revenue per airframe is much higher than the $100 million that some use. Since we are interested in Boeing's ability to completely zero out the deferred costs with its backlog, I think it is fair to use the backlog composition and using the 50% discounts that seems to be long term average discount. As a reference for the sanity check I used the Boeing 777-300ER. The production of a Boeing 777-300ER costs about $100 million and the market value during better days was around $150 million, giving a 33.33% profit margin. For the Boeing 787, although technology heavy, I do expect the production costs to be more or less the same. Using the average revenue per aircraft of $132.9 million, you end up with a profit margin of roughly 25% or $32.9 million. What this shows is that the assumption of a positive margin of $40 million that I sketched earlier is far too optimistic. What you can ask yourself is what this $32.9 million figure actually tells you. With Boeing using the program accounting practice instead of unit accounting, there is not a lot of transparency and the true importance of this figure might be unclear. To make it a bit clearer it is important to understand the deferred costs, which in essence are nothing more than the difference between Boeing's program assumptions for costs and revenues and what the company realized. So for every $1 million that Boeing expected based on their calculations and that was not there, $1 million was added to the deferred costs. As of now, the deferred costs stand at $28.651bn and Boeing expects to zero this out completely by the end of their 1300-unit accounting block. This is where the $32.9 million becomes important. We know how many units there are left in the block, so we know how much profit Boeing either by cutting costs (most likely) or increasing revenue (less likely) Boeing has to make. As long as Boeing has zeroed out the deferred costs by the 1300th unit in the accounting block there is no problem. There are 907 units left in the block, meaning that Boeing has to make an average profit of $31.6 million on those airframes. Implementing the assumption of flat deferred costs for 2016, the average required profit is $35.7 million. This is a very simple calculation that shows at first sight Boeing will not be able to recoup the deferred costs within the accounting block. Careful research has shown that average revenue for the Boeing 787 is likely close to $133 million. Program projections that use $100 million as a revenue estimate are heavily flawed, since $100 million is most likely a cost estimate rather than a revenue estimate. Using some very simple calculations, it does not seem achievable for Boeing to break-even within the current accounting block, unless they are working on a tremendous cost cutting effort whit sizable impact on Boeing the 787 production costs. What you should be aware of is that I am not attaching a sell advise to this outcome, but see any dip caused by Boeing's accounting practices as a very strong buying opportunity.
