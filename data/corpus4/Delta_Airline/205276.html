ETF Hub Oct 15 2015, 12:27 ET | About: The Boeing Company (BA) | By: Carl Surran , SA News Editor Boeing ( BA +1.8%) rebounds a bit from yesterday's losses sparked by negative comments by Delta CEO Richard Anderson about a "bubble" in the market for wide-body airplanes, as several analysts defend the company . Stifel's Stephen Levenson recommends buying the dip , saying it disagrees with Anderson and wonders if he is "making these remarks in an attempt to get better pricing as a rise in fuel costs could have a significant negative impact on profitability for those carriers operating aged fleets." Delta has a "vested interest in talking down prices," Cowen analyst Carl von Rumohr agrees, and Boeing is poised to report strong Q3 results, so yesterday's stock decline "looks excessive." Anderson offered no specifics beyond a price quote on one used 777, which is probably not representative of the market as a whole, says Citi's Jason Gursky, who keeps a Buy rating on the stock as Boeing's cash flow growth and shareholder-friendly cash usage make the stock attractive. All three analysts also defend airplane parts maker Spirit AeroSystems ( SPR +0.4%), whose shares fell yesterday along with Boeing; like Boeing, SPR has strong cash flow growth and deploys its cash in a shareholder friendly manner, Gursky says. I don't usually agree with analysts but in this case I do in that it is suspicious that Anderson chose this point in time, with little factual information to back his claim, to speak out regards a ' bubble ' for wide bodies.   For BA to decline in the manner it did yesterday is absurd given it's strong fundamentals, huge order book and, as the author states, it's strong cash flow growth and deployment of cash in a shareholder friendly manner It was personal. Delta and BA aren't exactly on the best of terms. Anderson obviously wants to lower the prices in the market so he can buy lower. The real interesting question is what's going to happen when the first tranche of A380s come onto the secondhand market.
