Is There A Bubble Forming In Jet Plane Orders For Boeing? - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Bret Kenwell , Future Blue Chips (43 clicks) Recent comments from Delta's CEO spooked Boeing investors about a potential "bubble" forming in the jet market. While I respect the CEO's opinion, many aerospace executives haven't seen the same thing -- at least, to investors' knowledge. Shares of Boeing BA were finally starting to trade more bullishly following a few strong sessions to start off October. However, that quickly came to an end when shares fell more than 4% on Oct. 14 following some negative commentary from Delta Air Lines DAL CEO Richard Anderson. In Delta's most recent conference call , Anderson said, (Bold emphasis added by me): "We're seeing a huge bubble in excess wide-body airplanes around the world and we've been approached by more than one party. I mean, the market appears to be, [for] the 777-200s about 9 to 10 years old, the price is about $10 million. And on A330-200s the lease rate is about a fifth of what it would be new." "So we do think that the aircraft market is going to be right for Delta over the course of the next 12 to 36 months and we think that weakness in that aircraft bubble in wide-bodies is going to spread to narrow-bodies and that there will be some huge buying opportunities because low interest rates really have created a huge wide-body bubble in the world." Anderson attributed this glut of aircraft to the incredibly low interest rate environment - another unintended consequence from central bank policymakers. But the more important question for investors is, is this the end for Boeing? Boeing is the premier maker of jet planes, and while Anderson's comments are somewhat of a concern, we have to extrapolate more than what may meet the eye. First, there are a number of highly respected chief executives that continue to pound the table on the aerospace market, (as I highlighted, here ). For one, Alcoa's AA CEO Klaus Kleinfeld was pretty upbeat about aerospace, predicting 8% and 13% growth in 2016 and 2017, respectively. On Friday we'll hear from highly-respected Honeywell HON CEO Dave Cote, who last quarter said the company saw "robust" jet engine demand and expects a "modest acceleration" to that growth in the second half of 2015. Another big player, General Electric GE said airline traffic growth remains robust and aviation orders for the company climbed 30% in the quarter as a result. 3M Company MMM also cited strength in its aerospace market. United Technologies UTX expects long-term growth to remain intact too. That's the benefit from listening to so many different conference calls, as it really allows you to get a very wide view of the entire global market and its different industries. (I call this the "Big Picture Summary," which can be found, here .) I'm not dismissing Anderson's comments by any means, but I think it's important for investors to recognize that just because one executive has noted a surplus in decade-old jets -- a surplus that is a benefit to his company nonetheless -- doesn't mean the current secular bull market in aerospace is dead. At least, not in the eyes of some of the most well-respected executives in the country. There's also two other things to consider: the first being that Boeing has an enormous backlog of orders, and the other being that global airline traffic continues to grow at a rapid pace. I'll start with the latter, as global airline traffic is expected to grow 4.1% per year for the next 20 years, according to the International Air Transport Association . At this pace, the 3.3 billion passengers that flew in 2014 would more than double to a whopping 7.3 billion by 2034. Keep in mind, this is for air passengers, and not cargo flights, volumes of which are also expected to grow 4.1% per year for the next five years. Cargo flights very much matter as well, highlighted by the fact that FedEx FDX has placed orders for 48 Boeing 767s this year alone. If these forecasts are anywhere near accurate, it's quite clear that demand for air travel will continue to increase, and as a result, airlines are going to need more aircraft. While used planes will be an option, it will not likely be enough to satisfy the necessary demand. While 2034 is a heck of a ways away don't forget just how long it takes Boeing and Airbus OTCPK: OTCPK:EADSF to actually make these planes. Let's put it this way, year-to-date, Boeing has manufactured "just" 580 planes , while it's received net orders of 447 aircraft this year. It can barely keep pace with new orders, while the backlog remains deep. As of the most recent quarter , Boeing had a backlog for 5,700 aircraft, which will take eight years to build for an estimated value of $431 billion. I don't mean any disrespect to Mr. Anderson - after all, who am I to dispute the findings of a major airline's CEO. I'm certainly not shopping around for aircraft. But I think it's far too early to start calling it a "bubble," and it looks as though there are plenty of other executives -- and now analysts -- that remain bullish on the industry too, both in the short-term and long-term. I would expect Boeing management to address these comments in its upcoming earnings report on October 21st. Until then, I'm staying long.
