Yo Facebook, That's Sick - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Facebook was recently granted a patent for its "social glossary." The software is very interesting, but what does it mean for investors? According to Business Insider , Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) recently patented software that analyzes the social media website for emerging words and phrases, and then stores them in a "social glossary." Facebook's patent was granted in February, and specifically protects software that looks for neologisms (newly coined words or expressions). The software looks for lexicon that is increasing in popularity among groups of people, but is not yet widely or commonly used. Here's how Facebook outlined their procedure in its patent filing: Click to enlargeSource: Business Insider Facebook's software is designed to find the next "selfie;" a word that, at one point, was not a word at all and has suddenly become ubiquitous in our vocabulary. Once the software spots a word or phrase, it double checks that it is not already in use. If it's a new word or phrase and is gaining popularity, it gets added to Facebook's social glossary. Later on, the software checks that the terms in the glossary are still in use and removes the ones that have become less popular. If you're like me, you think this new software is very cool. Or maybe you think Mr. Zuckerberg is just trying to stay hip. Either way, if you're an investor, you only care about one thing: How Facebook's social glossary can make you money. Facebook has yet to reveal how it will integrate the software into its existing platforms. Business Insider says one idea floating around is that Facebook would use it to incorporate slang into its predictive keyboard. To me, though, this doesn't seem to be the best application of the social glossary. Adding terms from the social glossary into Facebook's predictive keyboard wouldn't add revenue. Also, the terms in the social glossary are gaining popularity. The words are not relevant to the majority of users (at least not at first), so they wouldn't be a useful addition to the predictive keyboard. Instead, I think Facebook's social glossary should be applied on the advertising side. In the fourth quarter of 2015, Facebook saw its advertising revenue grow by 57% to $5.6 billion. To sustain such a high growth rate, Facebook should consider adding new advertising resources to its platform, the most logical being its social glossary. The company can go different directions if it chooses to use the software in its advertising space, and both are good for investors. Facebook could make its social glossary private and charge companies for access to it, or the company could integrate it directly into its existing advertising platform and make it open to the public. I believe the social glossary provides attractive information for advertisers. They can use the words and phrases to create targeted and relevant advertisements, for example. What better way to stay relevant than to use the latest vocabulary? Perhaps it sounds far-fetched to some, but I think advertisers would actually use this information. I digress: I can't help but remember the story of Song Airlines, at the time a subsidiary of Delta Airlines (NYSE: DAL ). Song desperately tried to get the saying "that's so song," a replacement for "that's so cool," off the ground. You can tell by the fact that no one walks around saying "that's so song" that this campaign was an utter failure. I am not suggesting companies will flock to Facebook's social glossary in an attempt to associate every new word of our vocabulary with their company. I am suggesting, however, that investors do not misconstrue Facebook's social glossary. Companies will pay up to have an edge over their competitors, and Facebook's social glossary would give it to them. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
