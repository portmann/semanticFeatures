Ford Motor Is Shooting The Lights Out - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford Motor released another set of excellent sales figures on Thursday. The auto manufacturer sold 23% more vehicles y/y, while F-Series retail sales continue to surge. While other auto manufacturers like Volkswagen AG (OTCQX: VLKAY ) are suffering from an unprecedented, self-inflicted emissions scandal that is set to cost the German company billions and billions of dollars, it is smooth sailing for American auto manufacturers, and Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F ) in particular. Why? Because Ford is on a roll in the United States, and there seems to be no stopping. The auto company released September sales for its U.S. market last week, and they were excellent. That's an understatement, really; Ford Motor's results shot the lights out. According to Ford Motor's sales release , the auto company sold a whopping 221,599 vehicles last month -- 23.0% more than a year ago when Ford Motor sold 180,175 vehicles. The 23% y/y sales increase in September even puts Ford Motor's sales growth of 5.4% in August and 4.9% in July to shame. Importantly, Ford Motor's vehicle sales surged in all categories, which is good news. Ford's car sales grew 18.9% in September from 53,609 vehicles a year ago to 63,732 vehicles; utility sales jumped 26.8% y/y from 55,140 to 69,892 vehicles, and truck sales increased 23.2% year-over-year from 71,426 to 87,975. It's been a great month for Ford Motor all around. Year-to-date, Ford Motor now sold a total 1,972,188 vehicles, which is 4.6% more than during the same period last year when the auto maker sold 1,884,617 vehicles. Ford broke sales records in months prior, so it doesn't come as a surprise that the auto maker continues to do well in terms of sales: According to Ford's press release, retail sales in the United States also jumped 23.0% last month which was the "best September performance in eleven years". F-Series retail sales, which are a defining sales driver for Ford and closely watched by investors, increased 28% y/y, and marked the best sales result since 2006. Right now, from a U.S. sales perspective, things couldn't be any better for Ford Motor. Truth be told, Ford has been the biggest disappointment for me in 2014/5. I've had high hopes in early 2014 about Mr. Market being able to reverse Ford's painstakingly low valuation...so far, Mr. Market has not come around yet. In fact, investors have continued to give Ford the boot over the last few weeks as China's growth concerns took center stage. Ford Motor's stock is down ~10% this year. I have already stated numerous times that I think Ford Motor's 2015 consolidation is undeserved simply because the company delivers strong sales numbers. Granted, growth in China is slowing for the time being, but a Ford Motor investment is so much more than a China growth play. Since Ford derives the biggest chunk of its revenues and operating earnings in the U.S., the auto maker is indeed in a good position to ride the storm out. It is almost painful to watch Ford Motor's stock price languish the way it does. The auto maker sends out excellent sales updates with consistent regularity, but it doesn't get anything in return. American consumers love cars, and they love Ford Motor's vehicles, especially its F-150 and brand SUVs. But investors don't love the company, and that's a problem. Ford's market valuation, on the other hand, does not adequately reflect the realities on the ground. And that's a chance: The risk of overpaying for a 4%+ yielding S&P 500 stock at ~7.2x 2015e earnings is very low. The best approach to investing in Ford Motor: Buy the stock, collect the dividend, shrug off market corrections or buy more stock, and watch the show unfold over time.
