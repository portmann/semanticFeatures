GM, Ford US Auto Sales Tumble In "Bellwether" Month Of May | Zero Hedge You can't say we weren't warned. As reported over a month ago , the biggest drag on recent consumer spending was auto sales.  And this is happening as Automaker inventories are at their second highest in 23 years. If sales are collapsing, then the violent spike in relative inventories as seen in 2008 is not far away. One month later, this is finally starting to materialize in the OEM numbers, when earlier today both GM and Ford's US vehicle sales fell more than analysts had estimated in May. According to Bloomberg this "raises questions about stalling consumer demand." Not really: as we also warned a month ago when looking at stalling use car price changes, it was only a matter of time before the lack of demand for every low priced autos spilled over to new car sales, which it now has . GM sales plunged 18 percent, missing estimates for a 13 percent drop, with all four brands reporting declines of at least 14 percent. Fordâ€™s light-vehicle sales slid 6.1 percent, according to Bloomberg, compared with an average estimate for a 4.9 percent decline. GM projects a sales pace for the month that is slower than analysts had predicted. GM said retail sales fell 13 percent and it continued to pull back on deliveries to rental-car fleets. The largest U.S. automaker said it sold 22,000 fewer rental cars in the month, the biggest reduction in the past two years.  Sales of Ford and Lincoln passenger cars plunged 25 percent, led by a 37 percent slide for the Taurus sedan, once the companyâ€™s flagship. Even the redesigned Mustang saw its momentum fade as deliveries dropped 24 percent. Sales of the recently restyled Ford Edge sport utility vehicle fell 14 percent. F-Series truck sales rose 9 percent and van sales had their best May since 1978 on the strength of a 16 percent gain by the full-size Transit. To be sure, all of the six largest carmakers were estimated to report declines for May, but the severity of the drop has taken many by surprise. As Bloomberg notes, "even as auto sales gained in April and the U.S. consumer continues to spend, there have been signs of wavering economic confidence, and the industry may struggle to maintain its record pace. As a kickoff into summer on the back of Memorial Day weekend promotions, May is a bellwether for gauging buyer appetite." May deliveries â€œare set to fall year-over-year with two fewer selling days combined with retail demand that is holding steady, but not growing,â€? Tim Fleming, an analyst at Kelley Blue Book said in a statement before the monthly results. And the spin from Fleming: â€œWhile this year may not bring the growth the industry has become accustomed to, it is important to remember that sales are still at record levels.â€? Yes, but they are now rapidly tumbling. Excited for used car prices to collapse in the coming year.  Could really like to get myself that new 330i plug-in hybrid.  120 mpg isn't bad.  I'm   making over $7k a month working part time. I kept hearing other people tell   me how much money they can make online so I decided to look into it. Well, it   was all true and has totally changed my life.

According to Krugman all except "angry white Republican men" are excited to support a continuation of Obama's policies... "Maybe a majority of Americans, while not full of joy about the aftermath  of financial crisis, think pretty well of Obama, and are reasonably  willing to support a continuation of his policies. Maybe the Trump  phenomenon is about the rage of angry white Republican men, a rage not  shared by voters at large. Maybe Clinton is a much better candidate than  sheâ€™s given credit for â€” her main problem is not lack of â€œauthenticityâ€?  or whatever, but the unremitting hostility of the media, which have  given her far more negative coverage than theyâ€™re given anyone else." I wonder if he believes this, or if he's just shilling - if it's the former, he's seriously deranged. If he's shilling, he's the sack of shit I've come to know and love. Don't people have money for cars? Whaaat? In such a great economy now? It must be their healthier lifestyle choices - they go for bikes nowadays! Ford sales down 6.1% compared to -4.9% estimate Sofa King Confused Bill of Rights 10:57AM When I can buy a new truck for under $40,000 I'll buy one.  Until then I'll drive my old one till it dies. Bill of Rights Sofa King Confused 11:00AM New UK road tax changes will make it very expensive to tax new cars (even very low emission ones) that are over Â£40K new. $70K trucks with 7 year loans or 3 year ultralow leases basically allowing people to "hold inventory" in their driveways because with 6 or 8K miles allowed to be driven, that is what you are doing for the automakers...you are taking inventory off their lots (and books) and putting it on yours.  Similar to the agreement you get with a mortgage...you get to maintain it for BAC or WFC or Citi who knows you won't finish the lease and gets to sell it to some other schmoe after 7 years where you paid 70% interest during that time. But Ford makes their cars out of military-grade aluminum. Denis Leary yells that at me every time I try to watch the game. People don't want military grade aluminum or something? Did someone mention Dennis Leary...? "I use public toilets and I Piss on the seat, I walk around in the summertime saying how about this heat...!!" "F-Series truck sales rose 9 percent and van sales had their best May since 1978 on the strength of a 16 percent gain by the full-size Transit."  There's your 'lagging indicator', right there.   Transit vans are primarily commercial vehicles for transporting small freight - think UPS/FedEx/DHL and other various & sundry carriers - oh, and Amazon...   Spikes in purchases of these 'assets' as seen with the Transit, are usually the last gasp of expenditures which glide on a film of cheap money, and fulfill end-user/retail demand. There are going to be vehicle/asset auctions the likes of which have never been seen before when the consumer taps out for good.    Could not happen to a better administration... My buddy who sells Fords is getting desperate, he's had maybe 3 or 4 sales in the last two months. Dealership he works for continues to receive vehicles from Ford that they don't want, but have no choice but to take them. He almost took a part time job at Kroger, but turned the job down at the last minute. Bad move, as he's now begging for money from family and friends, just to pay house bills. I wish I could buy a truck without the plethora of gagets and gizmos. Just an automatic, stereo and air conditioning please! I'm about to buy a 2003 F150 for $1000 that runs great with AC and stereo.Everyting else is manual, even the crank windows.
