Ford Motor Co. - A True Tortoise - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford is the only major US auto maker that is both too big to fail and did not take any government help in the 2008 crisis. This proven performer has the global footprint ideal for stability in the rolling push-pull recession/recovery macro environment expected to prevail for many years. Income investors can achieve moderate growth with an above-average dividend. The tortoise always wins the race. Slow, steady, reliable, and long lived, it survives changes in local and macro climates, resisting predators and enduring lean times. Many investors rush about like the hare, dashing about after quick profits and changing direction moment to moment. To succeed in growing a portfolio or with a reliable income for retirement, build your portfolio with tortoises . Ford Motor Co. (NYSE: F ) helped to shape the world we came from, the times we live in and the future that is approaching. The company is not so much about engineering as it about engineers, the people that apply theory to the real world to produce useful things. I submit to you that this enduring quality of the world's sixth-largest auto company is more valuable to investors than any transient snapshot of the sales, balance sheet, income statement, or latest model marketing hype. Few American companies embrace a culture with the long view and invest in that vision. Like the tortoise, this steady advance toward a clear vision of the future makes for a winner. My Editor's Pick article of February 18, 2013 , gave you 10 fundamental reasons to hitch your wagon to Ford. These remain true today. Let's re-examine them now: Price/Book - Ford's P/B ratio continues to track its historical 2.5X, the current 2.433 is a slight bargain, certainly no bubble in the late phase bull market. The fact that investors in the marketplace have consistently valued F at a significantly higher P/B ratio than its major competitors attests to the quality of the company and confidence in its future performance and growth, as well as its tortoise-like consistency. A P/B valuation suggests current fair value of $15.69, indicating the current $15.27 market is keeping pace with this important metric. This is another sign of investor confidence and assurance no bubble is present. Pre-tax income and share price continue to correlate well. This offers another metric backing up the valuation and absence of any bubble. Shareholders' equity is near historic highs. Soaring after reaching a low during the 2008 financial crisis, shareholders' equity is building faster than at any time in its history. Share price has not kept pace and can be expected to surge ahead to close this gap in the coming years. Payout ratios for F, currently at 61%, are somewhat ahead of its historical trend, but still at a very safe level. The strong current-year performance for the auto industry and for Ford in particular will result in a return towards the historical trend even after allowing for a modest dividend increase. Since re-instating a dividend in 2012, distributions have been growing consistently and can be expected to continue the trend. The commitment to dividends and dividend growth is tangible demonstration of management's covenant with shareholders. Total returns have correlated well with the S&P 500 for the past several years, sometimes outperforming and sometimes underperforming. The current underperformance can be expected to correct with an upside move by Ford, as results in 2015 continue to demonstrate its recent investments for organic growth are paying off. Five of America's top 20 selling vehicles are Fords. The re-designed F-150 and its manufacturing (currently supply constrained, but with new production now coming online), leadership in natural gas & propane vehicles, and balanced global footprint with emphasis on Asia are all working as planned to give tortoise reliability and strength. The technical chart for F indicates that shares are currently probing the lower boundary of its rising channel. The Friday, May 22nd close of $15.27 is also right at a long-term support level. It is important that shares hold above this price or else significant further near-term breakdown is likely. I believe that the shares are consolidating for another test of the $17.25 double top by year end if 2015 results continue on current trend. Finally, Ford's continued keystone position in the U.S. economy is truer than ever. The United States government, partly in co-ordination with other governments around the globe, has invested trillions of dollars and a great deal of political capital to keep economies from slipping back into recession, to stave off deflation, and to hold onto jobs (especially automotive jobs). Europe is well into its new round of EQ infinity, and China has embarked on its version of this new age resuscitation stimulus also. Clearly, this commitment remains, and it is virtually impossible to envision any administration allowing a major U.S. auto company failure anytime in the next several years at least. Few other sectors, industries, or companies can claim such a safety net. My article of October 8, 2014 , provided an YDP evaluation and appraisal for the company. Today, it is time to take another look at the YDP value and the strategies for growth and income that Ford can deliver. Ford shares have not yet returned to a stable relationship of Y = D/P (Yield = Dividend / Price) since resuming distributions after their 2006 suspension. The rapid rise in new distributions signals a commitment to income investors. However, capital appreciation and growth remain an important part of share pricing at present. The 4.3% historical yield trend, which prevailed prior to dividend suspension, is significantly higher than the current 3.80% yield, but dividend growth rates exceeding share price advance are expected to return to that 4.3% rate equilibrium over the next few years. The current dividend remains superior to that of 1.92%. The 4.3% historical trend for F shares is consistent with the longer-term historical S&P 500 yield rates of about that same 4.3%. Fair value of the current $0.60 annual dividend at the 4.3% historical yield trend is $13.95. Clearly, strong dividend growth and capital appreciation driven by organic growth along with those increasing distributions add a well deserved premium to the pure income investor metric for fair value. I believe the $15.50 current fair value suggested by traditional financial ratios is more meaningful for the company at this time. Options can be used in a variety of ways to benefit from all these current elements. In the section below, I will focus on a strategy to generate immediate income while reducing market risk and boosting yield using covered option writing. I will also touch briefly on shorter-term option trading strategies of interest for Ford shares at this time. If you are a pure income investor looking to generate cash now, obtain a superior annual yield rate, and lower market risk, then writing Cash Covered Puts can achieve these goals. Write the 1/15/2016 $15.00 Put @ $0.97 premium. This creates an adjusted basis of $14.03, reducing market risk 8.12% below current share price. The absolute yield for this 235-day contract is 6.91% (10.74% annualized) on your covering cash. Discounted Entry Basis w/ Yield Boost Strategy: Buy-write the 1/15/2016 Covered Call @ $0.65 premium for a net debit basis cost of $14.62 per share. Absolute return on the Covered Call (if not exercised) is $0.65 premium plus 2 dividends for the period totaling $0.30 = $0.95 cash return on your $14.62 basis. This is a 6.5% yield instead of the 3.8% yield from the dividend alone. The net basis $0.65 below current market retail represents a 4.26% reduction in market risk. Annualized return is a pro-rata premium total of $1.01 plus $0.60 dividends = $1.61 cash income on the $14.62 basis, an 11.01% yield rate. Current share owners with a basis at or below $15.27 can achieve the same results by simply writing this Covered Call. (click to enlarge) (Source: schwab.com) Covered Option writing reduces market risk (as opposed to investing in the same ticker without writing the option) while generating immediate cash flow. This is the only form of derivative trading considered low enough risk that it is allowed inside IRAs, ROTHs, SIMPLEs, and other tax similar tax preference accounts. Bear in mind that these gains come at the expense of selling away potential future gains during the time of the contract above the Strike price chosen. Thus, they are income-focused strategies, not alpha nor total return oriented. Investopedia discusses the long straddle option strategy in great detail. This is used to profit from a move in shares in either direction. Only if the shares remain within the limited price range between the Call and Put Strike prices you select would you experience any loss. The current technical chart with shares consolidating at the bottom of the current up-trending channel and concurrently testing the $15.27 long-term support level suggests it is likely they will either fall through support and decline sharply towards $14.30 or that they will bounce off the current low end tests and move ahead towards $16.40 or even $17.50 over the next several weeks. It is unlikely that price will remain balanced on this razor edge right at the critical technical juncture for long. Thus, a speculative investor looking to profit from a move in either direction away from the current $15.27 should consider a long straddle option strategy. I personally do not recommend nor use options for these more speculative and "trade" oriented strategies and so will not make a specific suggestion for such a trade here. Ford remains a solid buy at fair value based on traditional financial ratio metrics now. It is not a classic dividend income equity at this time, but there are many reasons to consider it for income generation when combined with option writing. I have been generating excellent income yields this way on shares of F for a couple of years now. It has emplaced all the elements needed to power its continuing position as a major global player for the next decade and beyond. This includes: A) a globally diverse footprint with emphasis on Asia, B) leadership in natural gas and propane vehicles - a market destined for strong growth in the era of cheap, abundant, and more environmentally friendly natural gas, C) a popular line of electric hybrid vehicles, and D) streamlined focus on its top-selling products. Technical patterns are at an important juncture where they appear to be consolidating a strong base for an upside breakout rally. A failure to sustain this base could result in a revisit down to $14.30 support levels. Option strategies can be used to make superior returns with low risk right now even with shares currently price at full fair value.
