Ford to shift more production to Mexico - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Feb  8 2016, 03:14 ET | About: Ford Motor Company (F) | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor Ford (NYSE: F ) is planning to build a new assembly plant in Mexico to sharply increase output from the country, representing the latest shift of investment abroad by a Detroit automaker following the signing of a costly new labor deal. Ford expects to add 500K units of annual Mexican capacity starting in 2018 (more than double what it built in 2015), by constructing a new assembly complex in San Luis Potosí and expanding an existing factory near Mexico City. My understanding is that Ford is going to shift production of lower margin subcompacts to Mexico. Ford will then retool those stateside assembly plants in order to build a reintroduced mid-sized Ford Ranger truck and Ford Bronco. Rumor has it that Lincoln may be also getting a new SUV. Therefore, Ford can retain most UAW members in spite of the shift in some production to Mexico.
