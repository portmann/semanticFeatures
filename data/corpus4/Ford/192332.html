Ford: September Brings An Opportunity - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford shares are up less than 1% since the beginning of September. This comes despite a huge gain in September sales. Shares of Ford (NYSE: F ) are down nearly 10% year-to-date despite some fairly strong performance. Results from September have further confirmed positive developments at Ford and shares currently appear to be offering value investors an opportunity. September sales reports showed strong growth for almost all major automakers but Ford came out with the largest sales gain with a 23% year-over-year gain. While that number is in itself impressive there are other highlights also worth noting. F-Series retail sales surged 28% putting their growth above even the 23% company-wide gain. This is particularly important for two key reasons. First, it shows that consumers are willing to go for the new aluminum body F-150 that Ford took so much of a chance on moving forward with for the 2015 model year. Second, the F-Series trucks are typically higher profit and higher margin than the small car segment meaning each unit sold is doing more for the bottom line. The report also showed positive signs for Ford's SUV models with a 27% jump in SUV sales. Sales numbers also indicated a strong reception for the newly redesigned Explorer and Edge with sales up 38% and 33%, respectively. Ford's SUV and pickup sales are going strong partly due to a stronger economy and partly due to lower gas prices. Investors should keep in mind that a sharp rise in gas prices could cause sales growth in these high margin segments to pull back. However, oil prices have struggled to move higher as supply remains ample - likely keeping gas prices depressed for an extended period of time. Sales from the Lincoln brand also are a positive development from the September report. Lincoln sales rose 20% pushing them to their highest level in eight years. This development bodes well for the continued development for Ford's luxury brand as a whole. The sales boost at Lincoln also is a positive sign that the brand is generating greater interest ahead of the expected 2016 rollout of the new Lincoln Continental. On Friday there were concerns that the UAW would lead a walkout at Ford's F-150 production plant in Kansas City, MO. While Ford had been planning ways to minimize the disruption, a walkout at the plant would have been a major negative for Ford's efforts to continue producing and selling its popular F-150 truck. Fortunately, the UAW announced that a strike had been adverted late on Friday and Ford followed up with a statement on Saturday that they had "resolved open items." There still are uncertainties regarding the next labor contract but the resolution to this issue is a positive sign going forward. Since the beginning of September, shares of Ford are up less than 1% despite a strong sales report indicating interest in existing products, redesigned products and the growing Lincoln brand. At current levels shares trade at only 7.2x est. 2016 EPS and are accompanied by a 4.3% dividend yield. While Ford shares do have some cyclical exposure, the dividend-growth-value combination at Ford makes this stock worth considering for risk-tolerant investors.
