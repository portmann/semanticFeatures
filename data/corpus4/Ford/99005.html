Why Ford Looks Set To Go Further In The Chinese Passenger Vehicle Market - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford's growth in the Chinese passenger vehicles market is outpacing the overall market, which will help it improve its market share. Ford is now targeting the luxury segment in China, which is growing at a faster pace than the broader market, with its Lincoln brand. Ford is making aggressive investments to upgrade capacity in China, and is now fourth in terms of automakers by capacity in this market. Ford's focus on integrating technology into its vehicles in China will help the company attract more customers as the Chinese prefer more than just good looks from their cars. In a previous article , I had discussed the prospects of Ford's (NYSE: F ) commercial vehicles business in China and also discussed the overall opportunity in the Chinese auto market. Additionally, I had stated that commercial vehicles account for 24% of the American automaker's total business in China by sales volume. So, it is evident that passenger vehicles account for a lion's share of Ford's overall business in the country. Now, China contributes 17.6% to Ford's global wholesale unit volumes, and most of these volumes come from the passenger vehicles division. China is the second-largest economy and the largest car market by volume in the world. The impressive thing about China is that even after surpassing the U.S. in number of cars sold, the growth prospects are still robust as it is a developing country. Looking ahead, as more people move to cities in China and the middle class grows, it will have more first-time car buyers than any other country due to its huge population. As such, in this article, we will take a closer look at the prospects of Ford's passenger vehicles segment in China and whether the company will be able to increase its market share from the current 4.5% or not. Ford is working in a joint venture with a domestic car maker to tap the Chinese market. For its passenger vehicles, it is in partnership with Chongqing Changan Automobile Co Ltd., which ranks fourth among China's domestic automakers by volume. Importantly, this venture seems to be paying off as Ford's passenger vehicle sales in China have increased at a fast pace as shown below: Source : Data aggregated from Ford investor relations, charts by author. In fact, Ford's passenger vehicle sales have shown higher growth this year than the overall Chinese auto industry. The company's sales have grown at a rate of 9.1% from January-May 2015 compared to the same period last year. More importantly, there has been positive growth every single month. On the other hand, sales of passenger vehicles in China have grown at about 6.36% in this year's first five months. Higher capacity to tap this fast-growing market Keeping in mind the current industrial slowdown in China, Ford has cut down production targets in accordance with the revised sales projections. But it expects that this slowdown won't last long and that emerging markets such as China and India will continue to grow faster than the rest of the world. Banking on the so called Tier 4, 5, and 6 cities for its growth, Ford projects the Chinese auto market to achieve a volume of 32 million units by 2020. Attributing the lost sales in 2014 to capacity limitations, Ford has decided to expand its production capacity in China like never before in the last 50 years. It is going to invest $1.08 billion in a domestic car maker's under utilized factory to boost its passenger car capacity in China by 200,000 units annually by the latter half of 2016. Moreover, at the new Hangzhou -based assembly plant, the annual capacity will be 250,000 units with a flexible production line to accommodate the production of six different models. In China, Ford is now the 4th largest automaker by production capacity, behind only Nissan (OTCPK: NSANY ), Volkswagen AG (OTCQX: VLKAY ) and General Motors (NYSE: GM ). Ford offers a number of models in China, including the Focus, the Figo, the Fiesta and the Escort, along with the EcoSport, Kuga, Edge and Explorer CUVs. This means that Ford has a car for every type of buyer in China, which is a good thing. More importantly, Ford is now targeting the luxury segment as well. The company had launched its Lincoln brand in 2014 to target the luxury segment in China and received a good response. As a result, Ford will increase the number of dealerships from 14 to 60 by next year for this brand. Lincoln will be re-launched as Lincoln MKC , which will be a premium-compact-SUV that will compete with the Acura RDX, the Audi Q5, the BMW X3 and the Mercedes-Benz GLK-Class. In my opinion, this is a smart move by Ford since the market for luxury vehicles in China is expected to grow at a faster rate than the overall auto market. As per Market Reports , "It is projected that the luxury car market in China will grow at an annual compounded rate of 12% in 2014-2020 while the overall passenger car market will grow at 8%." Moving past the luxury market, Ford's next target is the smaller and mid-sized cities of China where the growth of the middle class is expected to happen. Ford plans to launch several new vehicles in China in the next year, including the 3-row version of the Ford Edge crossover, which has been designed specifically for Chinese consumers given the common demographic of joint families in China. The other one is the upgraded version of the Ford Taurus , redesigned with some improved and new features keeping the Chinese customers in mind. It will be launched in September this year. Ford has sensed that modern Chinese customers now demand more than just good looks and efficient engines in their cars. In order to lure them, Ford is working toward including a lot of technology in its new age cars. As a result, Ford will be joining hands with Tencent Holdings Limited to customize their online chatting app WeChat for its models available in China. Such a feature will be a part of its newer models that are yet to be released in the Chinese auto market. Ford believes that WeChat, given its popularity in China, will be able to increase adoption of its vehicles. China is an important market for Ford. As a result, the company is making strong progress in both the commercial and passenger vehicles segment. The company is specifically targeting the growth hotspots in this market, such as luxury vehicles and smaller cities where the middle class is growing. This will help Ford tap the expected growth in the Chinese car market going forward, and since the country accounts for a sizable portion of its volumes as mentioned earlier, this will have a positive impact on its overall financial performance.
