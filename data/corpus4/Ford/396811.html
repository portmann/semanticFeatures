Mexico's environmental prosecutor fines Ford 18 million pesos | Reuters MEXICO CITY Mexico's environmental prosecutor Profepa said Monday that it was fining Ford's local unit for selling vehicles in Mexico without the proper environmental certifications. The fine is just over 18 million pesos ($1.05 million), Profepa said in a statement, and is related to the sale of 4,690 vehicles. The company was missing certificates required under norms regulating gas emissions and noise levels. A spokeswoman for Ford in Mexico did not have an immediate comment.
