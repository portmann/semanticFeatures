Halc√≥n Resources: Taking Stock In The Eagle Ford - Halcon Resources Corporation (NYSE:HK) | Seeking Alpha Must Read †|† Jun.  7, 2015  4:22 PM ET †|† About: Halcon Resources Corporation (HK) , Includes: APA , CRK , CWEI by: Richard Zeits Subscribers to SA PRO had an early look at this article. Learn more about PRO ª Based on my well-by-well aggregation analysis, Halc√≥n‚Äôs April gross oil production in the Eagle Ford declined ~1% month-on-month and ~4% relative to the Q1 2015 average. Despite the curtailed drilling pace, completions calendar in April was very active, setting the stage for a solid production volume in May. Halc√≥n‚Äôs AFE in El Halc√≥n has declined to $7.5 million per well, from ~$9.5 million in Q4 2014. Individual well results are provided and discussed.

Halc√≥n Resources' (NYSE: HK ) April 2015 daily gross oil production in El Halc√≥n (Eagle Ford) in East Texas declined ~1% from the previous month and ~4% from Q1 2015 average. (Source: Zeits Energy Analytics, April 2015) The cadence and timing of well completions have been the primary drivers of Halc√≥n's production volumes in El Halc√≥n. Even though the company has reduced its drilling activity in the play to just one rig, the completion calendar in April was quite busy, with five new wells turned to sales. This compares to an average of three wells per month during the preceding twelve months when Halc√≥n was running 2-3 rigs in the play. With five new wells brought online in April, Halc√≥n's May production in El Halc√≥n will likely remain stable, even if no new wells are completed in May. As a reminder, East Texas Eagle Ford accounts for approximately one-quarter of the company's overall production volumes, with the Bakken being a much more significant producing area for the company. However, El Halc√≥n is important to the stock's valuation due to the asset's sheer size and significant value potential. Individual Well Performance In El Halc√≥n Halc√≥n's average well performance during the latest twelve months shows a noticeable uptick relative to its earlier wells in the play. Several recent wells - including the Sturgeon, Goanna, Lucy and Glover - have contributed to this performance improvement. The Lucy and Glover have a good chance of taking place among the top five wells among the ~100 drilled by the company in the Eagle Ford so far. Of note, Halc√≥n has commented that all four wells we are outperforming its 452 Mboe type curve. The following tables show performance of Halc√≥n's every individual well in the El Halc√≥n play. Shown in blue are new data points that have been added since my previous update. Reviewing Halc√≥n's Type Curve In The Eagle Ford My more granular analysis of Halc√≥n's recent individual well performance in El Halc√≥n suggests that the company's average well in the play is likely to produce 90-100 thousand barrels of oil in the first year on a normalized basis (using certain assumptions for off-line days). This result is essentially in line with the data provided by Halc√≥n in its recent presentation. Halc√≥n shows that its recent wells have produced ~118 Mboe in the first year. Two factors help to reconcile the difference between my rough assessment and the company's estimate. First, the graph below includes natural gas production (my analysis is focused solely on black oil). Second, Halc√≥n's sample excludes certain wells. An important footnote on the slide specifies that the sample includes "wells placed online since 1.1.14, spaced a minimum of 1,000 feet apart and completed with at least 1,200 lbs of proppant per lateral foot. Mechanically compromised wellbores excluded." (Source: Halc√≥n Resources, May 2015) The significant number of wells that have cumed well over 100,000 barrels of oil in the first year indicates that Halc√≥n's type curve may have some upside if the company manages to reduce the percentage of weak wells. However, at this point I hesitate to predict a material improvement - while several recent wells have been impressive, a greater consistency of wells that beat the type curve would be required. Halc√≥n has reported impressive (and much needed) improvements in its well costs at El Halc√≥n. In May, the company's AFE for its operated wells at El Halc√≥n was approximately $7.5 million, about 30% lower than in the fourth quarter 2014. In addition to across the board service cost reductions, the company has taken steps to bring certain service elements (such as directional drilling) in-house, contributing to cost savings and efficiencies. Quite notable is the company's commentary that it anticipates its completed well cost to continue to decline by additional 5%-15% in the next few months. That would bring the AFE in the ~$7 million range. (Source: Halc√≥n Resources, May 2015) Halc√≥n's cost reductions are very significant. However, as has been the case across the entire industry, much of those reductions are cyclical in nature and may not be sustainable in the event oil prices recover enough to justify higher activity levels. Halc√≥n's ability to minimize its well costs will be restrained for another few years as the company is still in lease capture mode at El Halc√≥n and continues to drill one well per pad. That means that one well has to bear the full cost for land and G&G costs, location preparation, title opinion, production facilities and gathering tie-ins - all charged to that first well. Halc√≥n estimates that completed well cost will decline by about another $1 million per well once it transitions to development mode sometime next year. Halc√≥n estimated that its type well in El Halc√≥n generated ~17% IRR, using 452 type curve, the current $7.5 million AFE and mid-May strip pricing. Obviously, a 17% well-level IRR can hardly be thought of as competitive in the context of U.S. shale oil business. The economics should become more compelling, however, once the company implements additional costs savings and completes its lease capture program. As one can see from the following slide, assuming those additional savings are achieved, the play should be viable at the project level at oil prices above ~$65 per barrel. My broader review of drilling results in East Texas Eagle Ford indicates that Halc√≥n remains an undisputed leader in the play in terms of its well performance to date. In addition to Halc√≥n, my comparative review has included drilling results for Apache (NYSE: APA ), Clayton Williams Energy (NYSE: CWEI ) and Comstock Resources (NYSE: CRK ). While well costs, completion designs and location within the play vary by operator and impact well performance, it appears that Halc√≥n is further along on the learning curve than its peers and therefore may be best positioned to opportunistically capture additional core acreage in the play at low cost in the event others retreat. That being said, Halc√≥n still has some ways to go to demonstrate that it can bring its drilling returns to a compelling level in a scenario that the oil price trough proves extended. For the time being, the company's drilling IRRs in the Eagle Ford trail far behind its returns in the Fort Berthold area in the Bakken. Overall, after the first three years of evaluation drilling in the East Texas Eagle Ford, one can conclude that the play has lived up to optimistic expectations and is now an established, proven play. The obvious disappointment is that the play has not yielded super-productive sweet spots that would be able to compete in terms of well productivity or economics with "core of the core" areas in the Bakken and South Texas Eagle Ford. Not dissimilar to many other smaller plays, drilling activity in the East Texas Eagle Ford has dropped dramatically, with the decline driven mostly by Apache taking its rig count in the play from 12 at the recent activity peak to just one rig. Comstock and Clayton Williams have suspended their new drilling activity and Halc√≥n will be running just one rig throughout the rest of the year.
