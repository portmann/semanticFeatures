Ford Opens R&D Office Down The Street From Tesla, But No Word On Electric Cars - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford hosted a media event in its new Silicon Valley R&D office, located walking distance from Tesla’s headquarters. The presentations included one on powertrain technology, but mysteriously did not mention anything about electric cars of any kind. The experience of hearing a powertrain discussion almost next door to Tesla, without a detailed debate about electric, was surreal. Does this mean that Ford, despite outselling Tesla by 25% in the US in 2014, has given up on plug-in cars going forward? I assume Ford simply isn’t ready to talk about its next-gen plug-in cars, and that they will compete with Tesla’s Model 3 when they get announced no later than 2016. I think it was around January 2012 when I first noticed that Ford (NYSE: F ) had opened a small R&D office in Silicon Valley. From what I observed, the office contained only two people, although it may have grown a little in 2013 and 2014. Fast forward three years, and Ford announced in January 2015 that it has effectively re-opened the office, a few miles away, now walking distance from Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA ) headquarters and headed by a person hired from Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). Earlier this week, Ford hosted an event for the media at this new venue, which now has 40 employees going to 125 by year-end. The presentations were led by an impressive cast of Ford's top executives, starting with CEO Mark Fields. The R&D teams presented on three areas: Lightweighting. Just like all the other automakers, Ford is seeking to take out significant amounts of weight from its vehicles. This isn't fundamentally any different than presentations I have seen from companies such as BMW, GM and all the rest. As always, lightweighting is a multi-dimensional set of tradeoffs, including cost and repairability. Cabin technology. From infotainment systems to safety, the cockpit is becoming filled with more technology. All car companies are researching the right balance between information and distraction, and what technologies will be most effective. That's right. There's a pink elephant right in the middle of the room. Think about it: Ford hosted a presentation about powertrain technology, located walking distance from Tesla's headquarters. Unless I missed something, there was not one word about electric. Not pure battery-electric, not plug-in hybrid. Not even plain vanilla hybrid. Nothing. The presentation was strictly about gasoline engines. From 1.0 liter 3-cylinder gasoline engines, to 3.5 liter V6 gasoline engines used in F-150 trucks and 600 horsepower supercars (2016 Ford GT). One can have a lot of fun speculating around this omission. There are two basic possibilities: Obviously this isn't 100% true, seeing as Ford has been offering one pure electric car, and two plug-in hybrids, for over two years already. In the US, in 2014, those three cars sold approximately 22,000 units - more than Tesla's 17,300. But despite out-selling Tesla by 25% on a unit basis, perhaps Ford has realized that these electrified cars are simply red ink boat anchors detracting from the far more profitable gasoline-only cars. Why should someone who buys a Fiesta, Taurus, Mustang or F-150 have to fund taxpayer subsidy-collecting leeches living in California's richest three coastal ZIP codes? So perhaps because of a theory along these lines, Ford has simply gotten tired of wasting money on an idea whose time has not come - and isn't about to arrive anytime soon. Gasoline is at $2.61 per gallon today, and the incentive to complicate your life by "going electric" is effectively nil unless you're part of a technological or environmentalist cult. For whatever reason, Ford isn't ready to yet unveil its Tesla-killer. It might do so later in 2015, or in 2016, and be in mass production by 2017 or 2018. That's certainly one theory, and based on this recent interview with Ford's electric car infrastructure boss, one might conclude that this new car will have LG batteries and be paired by a massive investment in infrastructure - can you spell "Ford Gigachargers"? - with 150 kW chargers installed around the country and beyond. This latter theory would have Ford coming to market with a new range of plug-in cars - BEVs as well as PHEVs - and they would be much better than the current three Ford offerings. One of them would be a direct competitor to Tesla's upcoming Model 3, which may be in mass production at some point in the 2017-2020 range, depending on whose theory you prefer. I clearly subscribe to the second interpretation - Ford is working on a new family of plug-in cars, PHEVs and BEVs - but it just doesn't want to talk about them yet. But that's not the point right now, right here. The point was the surreal experience of listening to a Ford powertrain presentation held within walking distance from Tesla's headquarters, and not hearing one faintest peep about anything electric. It was one of the oddest "avoiding the big pink elephant in the middle of the room" moments in recent memory.
