Between Uber, Lyft, Sidecar, ZipCar and Car2Go there’s no shortage of ride-sharing and car-sharing services out there to meet your specific needs. But having options is great, too, and with that in mind Ford announced the launch of its own car-sharing program that lets owners of its vehicle rent out their rides. MLive reports that Peer-2-Peer Sharing, as the program is called, aims to help select owners of Ford vehicles offset their monthly payments, while helping others get around town for short periods of time. â€œConsumers tell us they are interested in sharing the costs of vehicle ownership, and this program will help us understand how much that extends to customers who are financing a Ford vehicle,â€? David McClelland, Ford Credit vice president of marketing, said in a statement . â€œAs most vehicles are parked and out of use much of the time, this can help us gauge our customersâ€™ desires to pick up extra cash and keep their vehicles in use.â€? Under the program, which will launch in six U.S. cities and London, people can rent cars though the Getaround or easyCar Club website or app then collect the keys from the owner or a designated spot on the vehicle. Once done with the vehicle, users must return it to the same location. Users of the program, both the owners and the renters, must first be screened and approved by the company. Peer-2-Peer Car Sharing is part of Ford’s Smart Mobility plan which seeks to adapt transportation with changing technology such as mobility, autonomous driving and connectivity. “My great-grandfather helped put the world on wheels so everyone could enjoy the benefits of mobility,” Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford said in a statement. “Our vision today is to expand that same thinking using advanced technology and new business models, and addressing the mobility challenges people face around the world.” The new program will be available in Berkeley, Oakland and San Francisco, CA; as well as Portland, OR, Chicago and Washington, D.C.
