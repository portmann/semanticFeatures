Ford Stepping Up Its Game In China - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha China's economic growth is slowing, and Beijing could have trouble meeting its 2015 growth target of 7%. Despite slowing growth, Ford Motor remains committed to China, which is in the long-term interests of the company and its shareholders. The company plans on investing $1.8 billion in its smartcar R&D capabilities in China. Ford Motor (NYSE: F ) is not giving up on China despite a barrage of bad news lately. Slowing manufacturing growth and weak export data have disheartened investors and added to concerns that China is up for more trouble in the near term. China's exports fell 3.7% year over year in September, underscoring that weaker consumption is not the only reason why investors have become more skeptical about its growth story. As a matter of fact, with consumption and trade slowing down, China might have to revise its growth rates down again in the future. In September, China revised its 2014 growth rate from 7.4% to 7.3% on the back of weaker real growth in the country's service sector. Beijing expects to grow the economy by 7.0% this year, and the latest economic data casts doubts on whether China will be able to reach this growth target. Should manufacturing, consumption and exports fail to rebound, the country's economic growth might indeed fall below 7.0% this year - adding to investors' worries and putting more pressure on stock prices. While China's economy is taking a breather from years of aggressive expansion, Ford Motor doesn't see any reason to indulge in pessimism. Ford Motor's China sales have been slowing lately due to the factors discussed in this article, but the company remains committed to stepping up its game in the country. The company doubled down on the largest automobile market in the world this week. The automaker said on Monday that it is going to invest 11.4 billion yuan, ~$1.8 billion, in its smartcar research and development capabilities in China in an obvious effort to increase the consumer appeal of its fleet and to gain a stronger foothold in the dragon country. The move comes at the right time. In September, Ford Motor was shooting the lights out in the United States with 23% year-over-year sales growth on the back of booming pickup and truck sales. While the U.S. market is doing great, Ford's China sales have been in decline, and automakers reacted by cutting back production. Now is the perfect time to double down: China remains the biggest auto market in the world, and Ford's R&D investment could bear fruit for decades to come. Though Ford's investment in China is in the best interest of long-term shareholders, the stock continues to lack return expectations - and that's unlikely to change anytime soon. Investors take economic slowdowns very seriously, so Ford's investment in China is not going to dramatically change the narrative here or turn investor sentiment around instantly. However, there is little to argue that the Chinese market affords auto makers with the best long-term risk-to-reward ratio and the biggest opportunity for sales growth in the world. China is a growth market, and auto makers know it. The slowdown in China's economy might hurt auto makers in the near term, but the dragon country has tremendous potential in terms of car sales - no company can afford to miss this opportunity. Ford's decision to double down on the Chinese market at a time when uncertainty is back could lead to substantial dividends for the company and its shareholders down the road. The U.S. is in good economic shape now, but that's not a condition set in stone. As a shareholder, I couldn't be happier about the company's sizable investment in smartcar technology and into the future, even if Mr. Market doesn't immediately reward Ford's stock for it.
