Ford China venture to recall 220,000 SUVs over risk of fuel leak | Reuters A man walks past a Ford Kuga car during the media day at the Frankfurt Motor Show (IAA) in Frankfurt, Germany September 16, 2015. BEIJING Ford Motor Co's China joint venture will recall roughly 220,000 Kuga sports-utility vehicles (SUVs) over potential fuel leakages, China's quality watchdog said on Friday. A company spokeswoman confirmed the recall is specific to China. Driving on severely bumpy roads could lead fuel tubes in the SUVs to rub against other components, over time leading to wear and tear and potential fuel leaks, the watchdog, the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine, said on its website. The recall affects Kugas produced by Changan Ford, a 50-50 joint venture between Ford and Chongqing Changan Automobile Co, between 2012 and 2014. Prosecutors demanded details from Valeant Pharmaceuticals on its patient assistance programs, drug pricing and distribution practices.  Full Article   What?s Next: Tomorrow?s Digital Life Thomson Reuters is the world's largest international multimedia news agency, providing investing news , world news , business news , technology news , headline news, small business news , news alerts, personal finance , stock market , and mutual funds information available on Reuters.com, video , mobile , and interactive television platforms.
