Ford Motor: Bet On Strong Q3-15 Results Tomorrow, 12-Month PT: $18 - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford Motor will release third quarter earnings tomorrow. I expect very strong results based on Ford's excellent sales growth in the United States in recent months. Further, General Motors handsomely beat earnings expectations, which implies surprise potential for Ford Motor. Ford Motor (NYSE: F ) will release third quarter earnings early tomorrow morning on October 27, 2015. Naturally, shareholders are looking forward to the release date, hoping that the auto maker will make a case for buying its stock. While Ford Motor has been doing a solid job over the last few years in terms of launching new products and growing sales, the same cannot be said about Ford's shares, though. Ford's stock sits just below $16, and has become slightly overbought lately. But don't let the chart, or the Relative Strength Index for that matter, fool you here: Ford Motor can today be bought at the same price that investors were required to pay for the company in early 2011. Granted, shareholders got to collect a nice enough dividend -- and they continue to do so -- but from a capital growth point of view, Ford Motor has not been a winner. Despite Ford's disappointing share performance in 2015 and in the years before, the company is on track to deliver strong earnings tomorrow, which could be a positive catalyst for Ford Motor's shares. Why? For one, because General Motors Company (NYSE: GM ) released excellent third quarter results last week that beat consensus estimates by a wide margin. This implies that Ford Motor's earnings also have substantial surprise potential because the Street might be similarly too cautious about Ford's earnings growth. General Motors said it had third quarter earnings of $1.50 per share, which compares against earnings of $0.97 per share in the year ago quarter. The Street expected General Motors to report earnings of just $1.18 per share. Secondly, Ford Motor has been shooting the lights out lately with impressive vehicles sales in the United States. Remember, Ford sold 23% more vehicles Y/Y in September, and a booming U.S. auto market will leave an imprint on Ford's results that are set to be released on Tuesday. In the second quarter, Ford Motor also beat earnings expectations by a wide margin. Ford had Q2-15 earnings of $0.47 per share compared against $0.32 per share in Q2-14. Analysts were expecting $0.37 per share in earnings, an number that Ford Motor easily beat. According to Yahoo Finance, analysts now shoot for $0.47 per share in earnings this quarter on ~$35.1 billion in revenues. Since Ford beat the consensus estimates for U.S. sales in previous month, chances are that Ford with outperform earnings expectations on Tuesday, and potentially by a wide margin, too. There is a high chance that Ford Motor will follow General Motors' lead this quarter and report a significant jump in Y/Y earnings on the back of strong truck and SUV demand that has helped propel U.S. sales in previous months. Importantly, Ford Motor could outperform the consensus EPS estimate by a considerable margin, which in turn could be understood as a positive catalyst for Ford Motor's shares. While Ford's stock has not met my capital return expectations so far, there is a good chance that the auto maker will report excellent results tomorrow. My 12-month price target on Ford Motor is $18.
