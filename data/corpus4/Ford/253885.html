Ford: November Report Shows Truck Pricing Driving Sales - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha November sales figures for Ford show decent numbers and good momentum from pricing. Trucks are leading the charge into the holiday. Make no mistake about it, Ford (NYSE: F ) is more of a truck company now than they have ever been and the focus on trucks driving the business is at one of the highest levels we have seen since we have been following the business. For those who have read us on Ford, you know that we follow all of the monthly metrics that are available for the company to try and gauge how the business is operating in between standard quarterly reports. This includes looking at things like European auto registrations and US auto sales on a monthly basis. November sales numbers recently came out, showing what Ford lacked in volume they made up for in pricing and also showing that Ford sales continue to move in the right direction heading into the holiday. Total unit sales missed analyst expectations, but Ford still showed growth, especially in trucks. They had tough YOY comps, as the company stated in its conference call. This sales data, released on Tuesday of this week, looked like this, We also went back and listened to the November US sales conference call . Here are some of the key statements that stood out at us from this call: Taking a look at trucks. We sold over 65,000 F-Series, that's a strong number for November. At that number, F-Series retail sales were up 16% and it was our best November ever for F-150, specifically. Those numbers boosted overall F-Series volume to a 10% increase for the month. This comes against a backdrop of average transaction pricing that was $400 higher than October, so sequentially month-to-month up $400 and $2,700 higher than a year ago, with overall F-Series transaction pricing totaling $42,800 for trucks. So we remain very pleased with the strength of our F-Series business as we close out this year and head into 2016. Our full product range saw great gains in transaction prices in November as well, thanks to lower incentives and a really strong mix of higher series vehicles. In fact, Fiesta, Focus, Fusion, Mustang, Escape, Edge, Explore, Expedition and F-Series were all up in transaction pricing. It drove our transaction prices up $3,800 for Ford in November year-over-year, more than any other major automaker by a wide margin. We had just really exceptional price performance across our entire lineup. It's hard to believe it's December 1, we're getting to a time of the year where we're running out of months, and we're taking a look at our year-to-date sales and we are very pleased. Our performance year-to-date was up 5% versus last year. That's over 113,000 units with one big month to go. Most of that increase is in retail and our retail sales have hit their best year since 2005, driven by consumer demand for newest vehicles. As you can see, Ford remains confident heading into the end of 2015 and into 2016. Our article yesterday talked about the company opening a new plant in Kentucky to manufacture its F-250 and F-350 models, which will now be made out of aluminum just like the F-150 is. We made the point yesterday that the timing could not be better for such a move as aluminum pricing remains very low and will continue to help Ford's margins. This seems to be of more importance now than it has been in years past as trucks are one of the sole drivers behind the company sales growth and as we predicted, we think that the chance to employ people in the United States to build these trucks will only help Ford's image. We ad also concluded in the past that Ford was making the right move when they decided to introduce a new top-of-the-line F-150 model in order to take advantage of margin expansion and increased demand. It's these types of moves that we are seeing the effects of now as pricing is helping to drive the momentum behind the company heading into the holiday. In addition, while incentive selling continues to be a moderate catalyst for the company, we still believe that the automaker has many levers that they can pull in terms of incentivizing buyers and fueling more sales. The November numbers, while not a grand slam home run, were respectable and showed strength in the right areas. Based on the numbers themselves, the company's conference call, and our expectations for Ford in the New Year we gladly remain bullish on the company heading into 2016.
