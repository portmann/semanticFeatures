Ford And GM: Dividend Investors Should Take Advantage Of These 4% Yields - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford and GM have seen their stock prices decline over the past year despite some strong economic tailwinds that have boosted their operating results. Still, investors don't seem convinced. It seems investors are worried that the low gas prices and low interest rates that have helped Ford and GM are about to vanish. I would counter that the recovery in the housing and labor markets are far more important indicators of Ford's and GM's future results. On these fronts, things look very good. Dividend investors can use their declining stock prices as opportunities to pick up 4% dividend yields from these well-run automakers. This seems like a great time to be an automaker. Gas prices are low thanks to $60 oil in the United States. The price of oil is down by about 40% since reaching nearly $100 per barrel at the peak last year. Furthermore, credit remains very easy, as interest rates continue to sit near historic lows. Both of these factors heavily incentivize car buying, and the major U.S. automakers are reaping the benefits. As a result, conditions are ripe for rising car sales, and that has indeed happened. In fact, U.S. auto sales soared in May. Last month, U.S. auto sales hit 17.79 million units at a seasonally-adjusted, annualized rate. This represents the highest rate since summer 2005. But apparently, someone forgot to tell Ford Motor (NYSE: F ) and General Motors (NYSE: GM ) investors, because both stocks are performing poorly. Over the past year, shares of Ford are down 10%, while GM is flat. Investors aren't giving Ford and GM much credit for everything that's going well right now. But here's why this pervasive negativity may actually be a great buying opportunity. Despite their poor stock price performance, Ford and GM are doing very well from a fundamental perspective. Ford is the maker of the F-150 pickup, the most popular vehicle in the United States. In May, Ford saw record sales results across several models. The Ford Edge had its best May ever, with sales up 34%. The Ford Mustang had its best May and year-to-date results since 2007. Retail sales of Lincoln vehicles rose 10%. Meanwhile, GM's sales rose 3% last month , and the company had its best May performance since 2007. Pickup trucks and cross-overs were especially good sellers for the company. Chevy pickup sales jumped 30% while Silverado deliveries rose 11%. Still, the market is brushing off their excellent results due mostly to fears that the good times are about to come to a screeching halt. Indeed, it's reasonable to assume economic conditions won't be quite this favorable moving forward. It's unlikely gas will stay at extremely low levels forever, and oil has already bounced about 30% off its 2015 lows. Separately, it's widely expected that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this year, possibly in September. Rising rates will make the cost of borrowing more expensive, which will conceivably put a dent in auto sales. But it's worth noting that low gas prices aren't typically the biggest driver of car sales. I view the health of the housing and labor markets as far more important indicators of whether consumers can, and will, purchase automobiles. On those fronts, I'm not overly concerned. The housing market is in recovery, and the U.S. is adding jobs. Jobless claims fell 12,000 last week, and initial claims are near 15-year lows. Moreover, the U.S. added 280,000 jobs last month, with another 32,000 in upward revisions to March and April job growth. Plus, average hourly worker earnings rose eight cents last month. I believe these factors are atop the list of consumer concerns before buying a new car, while gas prices and interest rates are much further down in the pecking order. For example, oil prices were much higher in 2014, which caused Ford's automotive revenue to fall only 2% . For its part, GM grew auto sales by 2% last year , and has registered two consecutive years of record sales when oil prices were substantially higher. Clearly, the major U.S. auto manufacturers can thrive, even under higher gas prices. From this perspective, one could argue that Ford and GM have been beaten down too far and are now good buying opportunities. Investors who maintain income-oriented portfolios should view both Ford and GM attractively right now because their dividend yields are at rarely-seen levels. Ford and GM both currently yield 4%, which are very near five-year highs for both companies. Their dividend yields are elevated because their stock prices are languishing, but all the while, they are both aggressively raising their dividends. Since Ford restored its dividend program in 2012, it has tripled its payout. It has grown its dividend by 44% compounded annually over the past three years. Meanwhile, after reinstating its own dividend last year, GM recently delivered a solid 20% dividend raise. I view dividend announcements as a view into how management perceives the future of its business. Companies that foresee trouble up ahead typically won't raise their dividends, and especially not at such high rates. I see their generous dividend increases as signs that both management teams are very confident in their company's future. Because of this, I'm inclined to see Ford and GM's recent underperformance as great buying opportunities for income investors.
