Ford: A Closer Look At This New Growth Frontier - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford will take the share of electric vehicles in its portfolio from the current 13% to 40% by 2020 by introducing 13 new models. An increase in the EV portfolio will allow Ford to command higher revenue and margins as EVs have a higher selling price than regular counterparts. Fordâ€™s $4.5 billion investment in EVs will allow it to regularly upgrade battery technology and it has already made good progress on this front. Ford has increased the range of the Focus Electric by 31%, while it can be charged to 80% in just 30 minutes, an improvement of 80% over the previous version. Ford, however, needs to constantly upgrade battery technology as it is still behind the likes of Tesla and Nissan in terms of battery life and range. Ford (NYSE: F ) has had a rather forgettable year in 2015 as a slowdown in the Chinese auto industry has affected the company's growth this year, but from a long-term perspective, Ford is pulling the right strings in a bid to improve its performance. This week, Ford announced its plans to add 13 new electric vehicles to its portfolio by the end of the decade. As a part of this initiative, Ford will invest an additional $4.5 billion as compared to the earlier planned amount for the development of electrified vehicle solutions by 2020. At present, Ford has 13% of its vehicle offerings electrified on a global scale, and intends to take this share to 40% by 2020. Thus, Ford has lined up an aggressive target for itself in the EV space, which is why its latest push into this segment represents its largest-ever investment in EVs in a five-year period. In my opinion, this concerted push from Ford into EVs is a smart move if we consider the prospects of this segment. The EV market's prospects are strong With the worsening climate and awareness regarding the effects of using fossil fuels on the environment, the world is finally shifting towards zero emission technologies. Advancements in the field of clean energy solutions over the past decade are also strong drivers of this change. In the case of automobiles too, EV technology is being increasingly accepted, especially in the developed countries of North America and Europe where the supporting infrastructure is in the advanced stage. But despite all the awareness, other regions of the word are not yet ready for EVs as a norm. And these regions include the most populous countries of Asia-Pacific, South-East Asia, South America and Africa. Other than these markets, only China has the potential to develop as a big market for EVs. China's potential for EVs is because of its environmental problems and its government's willingness to eradicate them. Otherwise, the oil and gas driven vehicle numbers have not yet reached to intolerable level in any other country that they feel the urge to incentivize or promote EVs. Thus, it is North America, China, and Europe where the EV market has a considerable size and only these markets have something for EVs in at least the next one decade. Looking ahead, this trend will continue as China has pledged to improve its EV infrastructure drastically in the coming years. For instance, in September this year, China announced that it will build 12,000 charging stations for EVs, along with 4.5 million charging points in a bid to encourage EV sales in the country. The chart given above clearly indicates that the Chinese government's efforts are bearing fruit as EV sales in China have more than tripled in the first 9 months of the year. In comparison, China had just 30,000 charging points last year, so the country has set an aggressive target to build up its infrastructure. Thus, the market for EVs is expected to grow at an impressive pace going forward, with Navigant Research forecasting that the global light duty EV market will expand from 2.7 million units last year to 6.4 million units in 2023 under a base case scenario. So, Ford has done the right thing by going aggressive in the EV market. Let's take a look at the steps that the automaker will adopt to push up its sales in this segment. The following graphic gives a snapshot of what Ford intends to do in a bid to tap the growing EV market. As seen above, Ford has lined up a multi-pronged approach to tap the growth in the global EV market. More importantly, the company seems to have got the basics right as it is focused on developing cutting-edge technology to tap this segment. For instance, "Ford is expanding its global battery research and development footprint for electrified vehicles this year, adding research and engineering capabilities in Europe and Asia to take advantage of new market opportunities." In both the regions, Ford is looking to create a "hub and spoke" model that will allow the company, on a global level, to increase the pace of the growth of its battery technology, which will allow it to capitalize on opportunities on both a local and a global scale. As a part of this plan, Ford has announced that it is building a new battery lab at the University of Michigan with an investment of $9 million and the Michigan Economic Development Corporation as the third partner in the tripartite partnership. This lab will help Ford advance its battery technology by allowing it to make lighter, smaller, and more cost-effective batteries. It will also enhance the pace of implementation of the latest battery technologies in future production vehicles by replicating the results of research technologies and battery development that's done at a smaller scale. Now, constantly upgrading the battery technology is a key part of Ford's EV plans as the adoption of its vehicles will depend upon the range that they provide. As such, the company is doing the right thing by investing in this area. More importantly, Ford will be releasing an example of its battery expertise quite soon with the upgraded Ford Focus Electric. The Focus Electric will go into production in the second half of next year, and is expected to go on sale in the U.K. later. It will be more capable as compared to the existing version as its range on full charge will be 100 miles as compared to 76 miles in case of the current version. Further, the vehicle will be able to reach 80% charge in just 30 minutes. This will be a big leap forward from the current U.S.-market Focus Electric that can manage the same charge in around 2.5 hours. Apart from these capabilities, the new Focus Electric will have a EcoGuide LCD Instrument Cluster with SmartGauge. This will allow the driver to witness real-time EV power usage in a bid to increase vehicle efficiency. Another smart feature, known as the Brake Coach, will help the driver learn the utility of the Regenerative Braking System and enhance its efficiency. Thus, Ford is leaving no stone unturned in delivering a complete package into the market, and going with the highly-popular Ford Focus is a smart move. Ford's EVs will have to compete with the most advanced EVs in the world from Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) and Nissan LEAF in the U.S. and Europe. But, on comparison, we don't find the new Focus to be coming anywhere close to Tesla's existing Models. Tesla's 30 minute charge gives 170 miles of travel, while the same charge in the new Focus gives only 100 miles. Though the Focus is a highly-improved model, it has reached only a level where it could stand as one of the good choices but still not among the best. In China, the low cost local manufacturers like BYD, BAIC, Chery, and Changan are the market leaders, which is why even Tesla is struggling to make a dent in this market. Therefore, while Ford is readying a fleet of EVs, it needs to upgrade its battery technology in order to compete with the best. Ford does not single out how much revenue it gets from EVs, but as mentioned at the beginning of the article, 13% of its vehicles are electrified. Now, looking ahead, Ford intends to take this share to 40%, which will allow it to increase its revenue and margins substantially since EVs are priced higher than their regular counterparts. For instance, the 2015 Ford Focus Electric has a starting MSRP of $29,170, which is substantially higher than the starting MSRP of $17,170 for the regular Focus. Thus, as Ford increases the share of EVs in its overall vehicle line-up, it will see an increase in its revenue due to a higher average selling price. Given the prospects of the EV market, it is not surprising to see that Ford has decided to make an aggressive push into this segment with its latest investment. Of course, the company is facing competitive challenges from specialized and established players in the EV segment, but it has made good progress in its battery technology, which will continue improving due to its investments. As such, Ford's latest push into EVs opens up a strong opportunity that will lead to positive growth in its financials in the long run as the EV market matures.
