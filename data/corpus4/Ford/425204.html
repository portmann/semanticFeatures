Ford: Are Investors Missing The Big Risk Related To Ford Credit? - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford likes to highlight borrower credit quality in its presentations. The company has always loaned to high quality borrowers, yet the finance wing still lost billions in 2008. Borrower credit quality wasn't the real problem in 2008. Operating leases were the problem. If lease risk-taking is similar to 2008, Ford is set up for much larger losses in the next recession according to company guidance. Fellow Contributor Patrick Gunn has done an excellent job highlighting Ford's (NYSE: F ) unique balance sheet situation and debt load, along with the answering the questions of how and why the automaker has made the moves it has within Ford Credit, the company's financing arm. There isn't anything particularly concerning off-hand to most investors. After all, the practice is common among automakers, as well as with other equipment manufacturers such as Deere (NYSE: DE ) and Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT ). Why businesses engage in building these financing wings is easy to understand. Paying cash for these large purchases isn't always easy, and the United States especially as a society is built upon debt. Having a controllable, in-house financing business often means a profitable side venture for the parent company and a seamless way of increasing sales, bridging the often difficult gap of linking consumers with a willing lender. The party line from Ford today is that loans are being issued to quality borrowers, minimizing overall risk. Lending volumes are up, and average FICO remained in the 740 range in both 2014 and 2015. Ford pegs the "risky" part of its portfolio at just 5%, marking the vast majority of loans as high quality. Credit metrics continue to improve, such as 60-day delinquencies falling y /y. Everything is sunshine and rainbows, of course. When does corporate management ever indicate otherwise? These might not be the facts that investors really need to know, however. It might surprise shareholders to learn that it wasn't borrower defaults that drove the vast majority of Ford Credit's losses during the last recession. The loss that Ford Credit undertook in 2008 likely isn't a surprise to many. Ford ended up hiking reserves for credit losses by 1.2B that year as otherwise healthy consumers began to default on their traditional automotive loans. Charge-offs, repossessions, and reselling cars is costly. However, if that was the only driver of losses, Ford Credit would have just broken even for 2008 according to management. But the total loss was much greater for that year: $2.5B. What gives? Leases are the answer to that question. Ford had to take a $2.1B impairment charge on its operating lease portfolio due to the steep decline in used vehicle auction values, along with hiking depreciation rates by $700M on existing leases to reflect the new operating environment. What drove those losses? When Ford gets a car back from a lease, the company generally dumps them in the used car auction market. While they leave a little margin on the table that way, it is the quickest and easiest way to move large volumes of vehicles. When 2008 happened and demand appetite among auction buyers fell off of a cliff, Ford bean counters essentially got caught with their pants down. The company had estimated it could sell a large volume of the cars it had leased during the boom years (2005-2007) for much higher prices than reality ended up allowing. Big losses followed as the company had to adjust everything down. This is incredibly important. While it is easy to point to consumer credit metrics for Ford and their propensity towards issuing high quality loans (even during the depths of the recent downturn), consumer defaults on debt obligations aren't the only way for Ford Credit to lose money, and in fact weren't the major driver of losses during 2008. Further confounding investors, it is difficult to paint a picture on what assumptions are being used by management in valuing their lease portfolios. Ford investors can draw comfort from a variety of metrics regarding borrower credit quality, but where can they draw comfort on the internal assumptions being used on lease issuances? The information simply doesn't exist. Managed receivables today under Ford remain slightly under 2007 and 2008 levels, but this number has rallied off the bottom in 2009 after the industry's sales began to return. Managed receivables are also not quite comparable as the company shifted Jaguar, Land Rover, and Mazda financing to other providers after the recession. Operating leases made up 20% of Ford's managed receivable exposure in 2007 before the company dealt with multi-billion dollar losses. Today? 19.7%, a number that has been trending back upwards after dropping initially following the big losses the company endured (15% of managed receivables in 2009 were operating leases). As far as the risk goes, Ford has provided this handy sensitivity analysis in its most recent 10-K: For every 1% miss on future expected auction values, Ford would be dealt a $101M hit to depreciation, with higher than expected returns (customers opting to buy-out their lease rather than return the vehicle) also driving losses. That is painful. What did Ford guide in 2007, before the big losses? A 1% change in auction values would drive just $60M in operating losses: At December 31, 2007, if future auction values for Ford Credit's existing portfolio of operating leases on Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brand vehicles in the U.S. were to decrease by one percent from its present estimates, the effect would be to increase the depreciation on these vehicles by about $60 million. That should worry investors. In a nutshell, this means that Ford is even more pre-disposed to multi-billion dollar lease losses today than it was in 2008, provided its risk-taking assumptions on leases are similar to that period. If history repeated itself, losses would likely approach $4B, potentially a bigger figure than that. Did the company learn its lesson? There isn't a real way to know the company's internal lease assumptions unfortunately. Long story short, just because the company deals primarily with prime loans doesn't mean that Ford Credit can't be dealt massive losses again in another downturn. Defaults are just one part of the puzzle, and may not be the primary one that investors should be concerned with. Is this a reason to sell Ford today? I don't think so - not by itself. But it is worth highlighting past results here to help investors ask the right questions of management in order to make sure they are managing lease risk properly. By owning Ford, investors essentially own an automaker/bank hybrid. Profit potential is higher, but investors need to practice more due diligence than they might expect.
