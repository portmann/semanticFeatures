2 Litmus Tests Point To Ford Success In China - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha We're closely monitoring Ford's growth overseas, combined with its ideas for fueling further growth. One item we've written about is the rebirth of the Lincoln Continental. Bullish March sales and a positive reception of the Cadillac overseas give us confidence, even though we're not GM fans. This will be a shorter article, simply to point out two things of promise for those looking to hold Ford for the longer term. China (and now India, as well) has essentially been the main focus for us when we look to see how Ford (NYSE: F ) is going to continue to develop. The automaker, while making progress domestically and overseas, has yet to put a kick behind its stock price of recent. Ford shareholders continue to look for answers; what is it going to take to move Ford's stock? One of the recent contentions we made was an article stating that a rebirth of the Lincoln Continental could be one of the catalysts that pushes Ford sales higher, while helping bump the stock over resistance. You can read that article here . Our readers will also be happy to know that we finally began staking our long-term position in Ford just days ago. We are now long the stock. Here's what we're looking at this week, 1. The first litmus test that continues to point to success is the fact that Ford outsold Hyundai in China. As reported this week, sales in China rose 1% to 104,842 vehicles in March. 2. The second litmus test is a little less prominent, but one that we took notice of and think the market needs to also take note of. It was reported that General Motors (NYSE: GM ) reported strong sales in China. Specifically, Cadillac sales rose 75.6% on new model introductions. This is important because it indicates to us that our argument that American luxury is still in demand overseas holds water. Ironically, the Cadillac is still partially out of favour domestically, but we're not the country with 1.35 billion people in it. We'd much rather see a burgeoning U.S. luxury market in China, with its dense populous, than in the U.S. If China responds the same way to the Lincoln Continental, Ford may have found its catalyst to break out of the funk it's perpetually been in the last couple of years. As investors, these indications are exactly what we're looking for. We are also looking forward to the upcoming Shanghai auto show , where Ford will have a chance to unveil vehicles specifically made for the Asian demographic, like the reworked Taurus. A new Ford Taurus is on the way, at least for some markets. As part of a huge unveiling of seven models for the Asia Pacific market at the Shanghai Motor Show , Ford is announcing the debut of the company's next-gen large sedan on April 18, just before the event in China begins. Unfortunately, the Taurus that we see in Shanghai might not signal too much about the future version in the U.S. Ford spokesperson Monique Brentley tells Autoblog that this debut is specifically for the Chinese market, and the Blue Oval isn't saying whether any of this updated look will come across the Pacific. The Taurus should pair well with the Continental to fill out growing demand for larger sedans overseas. As a reminder from an earlier article we wrote, the three reasons we listed for the Lincoln potentially making a difference were: 1. We think it marks the continued rebirth of the Ford name and brand to a number of younger generations. While some consumers that were fans of the brand likely never dissented from it, the lot that shunned the brand during the crisis will start to notice that things are again picking up. 2. It allows high margin access to overseas markets, specifically China. Luxury items sell well in China, just ask Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) or Burberry ( OTCPK:BURBY ). With a Chinese eye on American luxury, Lincoln should help the company roll out its plans of continued growth overseas in China, and places like India, where the company recently broke ground setting up a production facility. What model is better to do this than the classic American continental. 3. We think it's going to help a global shift in how people think about luxury automobiles. While GM's Cadillac brand has a timeless feel to it, especially because of its ageless logo and "cool" factor, Buick and Lincoln haven't done well to keep American luxury on the map. Buick is undergoing a shift to a sportier vehicle, but we believe the brand is stuck spinning its wheels. Lincoln has a real chance to reignite a spark for those who consider "luxury" to only be European. This can help Ford, obviously, but it can also help the U.S. domestic auto sellers grow quicker overseas. Also worth noting was that in Alcoa's earnings report on Wednesday of this week, the company's CEO pointed out that China has about 9 million vehicles that don't adhere to "Clean Air Act" standards. These vehicles will turn over, hopefully with Ford's new low emission vehicles. We added Ford to our dividend portfolio this past week. We don't mind collecting the company's attractive 3.8% yield while we wait for the rest of the market to see the value we see in owning the stock. In general, Ford continues to be our preferred way to invest in the U.S. auto market. Here's a piece on why we have a target over $20. Again, we have to reiterate that we take a long-term view on the company. Source: 2 Litmus Tests Point To Ford Success In China Disclosure: The author is long F.
