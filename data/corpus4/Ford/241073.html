Ford Has Momentum Into 2016 - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha We are long Ford and have been following the developments with the company over the last year. Data from October shows continued European registration strength wrapping up 2015 for the automaker. The Lincoln MKZ redesign is also a step in the right direction as Ford tries to spotlight it's luxury brand. We are permanent and perpetual Ford ( F ) bulls. We have been shareholders for the better part of the last year, although sometimes off and on for rebalancing purposes, and we have been watching almost all of the news that has been associated with the company as well as some of the third-party sales and registration data that helps us paint a picture of Ford's business in between its quarterly reports. We want to issue an update today, because we haven't written about Ford in a while, reiterating our conviction in the company, discussing some recent data points that are out, and talking about the opportunity in Lincoln. Our thesis on Ford has been that the stock price will appreciate meaningfully when the company is able to finally pull back the amount it is investing in itself and allow some of the hard work its done, mostly internationally, to drop down to the bottom line. The company is in a cycle right now of building plants, property, and equipment internationally and spending a significant sum of money in Europe and China to build out robust businesses in these locales. The long-term plan, obviously, is for these investments in tangible fixed assets all over the globe to eventually provide the company with some operating leverage. This is the point where we believe Ford's stock will break out of the mud that it is been in and finally reach well over $20 per share. It is because of this business plan that we feel its important to constantly monitor as many metrics as possible, especially overseas. Along those lines, European car registrations, a metric we have been watching monthly, were released for October and while Ford's marketshare has slipped slightly from 7.1% to 7.0%, the overall trend in Europe is positive. Registrations overseas continue to grow. Here is a copy of the full report , and here are some key statistics , via Seeking Alpha, Ford (NYSE: F ) car registrations +1.7% to 77,272 units in October, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. Overall EU registrations +2.9% Y/Y to 1,394,223 units in October, led by strong demand in Italy and Spain. Registrations in Germany and France were up 1%. It is encouraging to see things moving in the right direction overseas. We are looking specifically, also, for the company's progress in China, where it just made a recent investment. We have some contracted analysts looking at their business right now and that will likely be the topic of a new article. On the domestic front, Ford continues to do good things with Lincoln, it's luxury brand. We had written several times in the past about what a significant opportunity we thought Ford had in rebranding and repositioning Lincoln as one of the premier United States based luxury brands. With a brand-new image and brand-new advertising campaign, featuring well-known Matthew McConaughey, Lincoln seems to be picking up momentum. Most importantly, the late-model Lincoln SUVs and sedans that we have seen in show rooms and on the road continue to look impressive. They are modest but sleek, they are not too gaudy, and have some what of a European feel to them. Because of this, we were glad to see this morning's news that the company was going to be revamping and redesigning the MKZ. Details will be revealed later today. Here are some of the details from Seeking Alpha, Ford (NYSE: F ) is set to unveil the latest version of its luxury car the Lincoln MKZ at the Los Angeles Auto Show later today. The 2017 MKZ features a new grille design, a three-liter turbo-charged engine, 400 horsepower vs 300 HP on the current model, and an all-wheel drive system. Ford has also installed a new interior look and will offer optional crash-avoidance technology and a feature that will automatically slow and accelerate the car in traffic. The MKZ competes with GM's (NYSE: GM ) Cadillac ATS, BMW's ( OTCPK:BAMXF ) 3-series, Daimler's ( OTCPK:DDAIF ) Mercedes-Benz C-Class and Audi's ( OTCQX:VLKAF ) A4 in the $36,000-$50,000 price category. Elsewhere domestically, the company appears to be doing very well. Judging by the company's last earnings report, sales of the F-150 continue to be fantastic, with just limited exposure to incentivize selling. We still believe Ford has a couple of levers they can pull in that department to try and fuel sales even further. We were encouraged by the domestic numbers that were reported and we are happy with where the company's business stands domestically right now. All in all, Ford continues to move in the right direction on all fronts. Unlike it's partner General Motors, it has allocated capital wisely, investing in itself, and is focused on the long-term sustainability and health of the company. We think it's geographic expansion provides it with some redundancy in terms of business segment sales and we believe the long-term case for holding ford and collecting it's yield is intact.
