Ford Orders Dealers To Stop Selling New Edge Vehicles Over Leaks â€“ Consumerist Whoops! It looks like portions of our site are being blocked! Check your browser settings or contact your network administrator. It’s not often that a car manufacturer tells dealers to stop selling a certain model, but that’s exactly what Ford Motor Company has doneÂ with the new 2015 Edge, after finding out the vehicles can leak water. Ford recently ordered a stop-sale action on new 2015 Edges produced through April 28 and encouraged owners of the vehicle to take them to a local dealer for inspection and possible repair. The car maker issued the order over concerns that water may seep into the cabin through the sheet metal joint in the front pillar, directly behind the hood hinge on both sides of the vehicle. When the problem occurs, water enters the cabin behind the lower dash trim panels. It’s an issue our colleagues down the hall at Consumer Reports experienced first hand during recent testing of the 2015 Edge. In Consumer Reports’ experience, a routine evaluation of the Edge revealed wet carpet. Upon further inspection, the test facility determined that no other parts of the vehicle were wet, meaning their first inclination that the windows had been left open were incorrect. After finding Ford’s Customer Satisfaction Program 15B21, the car was brought to the Auto Test Center car wash bay, where a quick cleanse resulted in a “sopping wet” floor on the driver’s side. “Given the dark carpet, there wasnâ€™t a significant visual cue, but the carpet was more than damp. We let the vehicle air out over the weekend, and it dried up by Monday,” Consumer Reports says. CR points out that even a small, unnoticed leak could eventually lead to mold and mildew, as well as electrical problems for corroded connectors. According to the Ford customer satisfaction program, dealerships will apply a urethane sealer to seams if no leak has been previously detected. Vehicles that do show evidence of a leak will be held for a three-day assessment, including inspection, repair, time for the sealant to dry, and then test to confirm the fix worked. “It’s interesting to note that vehicles that do have evidence of water damage after the three-day procedure may qualify for a buy back,” CR points out. “Customers would need to work through their customer service rep on the details.” Click to print (Opens in new window) Ford Issues 6 Recalls Covering 101,000 Vehicles Subaru Recalls 660,000 Vehicles Because Being Able To Stop Is Necessary « Texas Billionaire Makes “Significant” Investment To Help Bring Back Blue Bell Ice Cream Got A Burning Need To Stream Old Video Games Though Your Cable Box?
