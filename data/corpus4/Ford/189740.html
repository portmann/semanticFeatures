WASHINGTON, A gauge of U.S. investment plans slipped more in August than initially estimated, giving a cautionary sign for the economic outlook. New orders for non-military capital goods outside of aviation fell 0.8 percent in August, the Commerce Department said on Friday. The government had previously reported that this gauge, which is a leading indicator of business investment, had fallen 0.2 percent during the month. Shipments of this category of goods also fell, declining a sharper-than-initially reported 0.4 percent and giving a bearish signal for third-quarter economic growth. New orders for overall U.S. factory goods fell 1.7 percent in August, Friday's report showed. Analysts had expected new orders for factory goods to fall 1.2 percent.
