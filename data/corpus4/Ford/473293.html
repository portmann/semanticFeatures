Ford Credit: Q2 Wasn't All That Bad - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford Credit is an essential part of Ford Motor, and its results are an important indicator of how the company is really doing. Ford Motor's quarter was not well received by investors - for obvious reasons - but Ford Credit remains strong. Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F ) did not have a very good day on Thursday and finished the day down just over 8%. Investors were none-too-pleased with the $0.08 EPS miss and cared little that YoY revenue was up 6%. Not helping things along was the strong beats that General Motors (NYSE: GM ) posted just a week ago. Investors were hopeful that Ford would post strong quarterly results as well but shares traded mostly sideways in the days leading up to the earnings release. Once the floodgates opened pessimism reigned supreme with bears declaring victory and bulls expressing justified frustration. I couldn't wait to get my hands on the Ford Credit slides to see how this part of the business was doing. At first glance I was discouraged and I still kind of am. There is plenty to be concerned about but plenty to be optimistic about as well. In the second quarter of 2015 Ford Credit generated $506 million in pre-tax profit; this quarter that dropped to $400 million. The 21% drop is concerning especially considering that managed receivables increased by 14% but didn't translate to an increase in profit. Year-to-date pre-tax profits are down by 8% amidst record auto sales. Fueling the drop in profits was the increase in loss-to-receivables which now rest at .37%, a 15 basis point increase. Lease residuals were not as kind to Ford as they were last year. The company actually gained money on the returned vehicles they just didn't gain as much as last year which cut into profits. The incentives offered during the second quarter also didn't help either. One only has to watch their television for ten minutes to notice the Ford commercials offering significant cash back and 0% interest for those who qualify. Also impeding profits were credit losses thanks to an increase in delinquencies and an increase in defaults from those delinquencies leading to higher severities compared to 2Q15. The higher defaults leading to repossessions and severities led to Ford placing more cash in reserves which also cut into profits. On a year over year basis the picture isn't as dire as this one quarter may indicate. The company still maintains a healthy average FICO placement of 741 with their "Higher Risk Portfolio Mix" maintained at 6%. Unfortunately even with a high quality portfolio of loans charge-offs and defaults are cutting into profits. If FICO scores start dropping through the year that would be a real problem but for now Ford Credit manages to secure high-quality borrowers. The length at which Ford finances or leases a vehicle has also been a concern for many investors. The good news is Ford is maintaining their 64 month figure and keeping 73+ month lengths low between three five percent. If we don't compare quarter to quarter the longer term picture for Ford Credit is pretty stable. The graphic above showing delinquencies and repossessions actually shows a pretty stable picture with this quarter actually showing some drops. These second quarter drops are standard. I guess the only real issue is that the drops are smaller from quarter to quarter compared to last year. What will be important to keep an eye on is how much higher these figures go up for the third quarter. Yes, there was some good news here. Ford has managed to lower the percentage of leases as retail sales compared to other auto manufacturers. Just 23% of US retail sales are coming from leases while the other manufacturers sit at 31%. This is good because as we learned above the company isn't making the same as it used to off these returned lease vehicles. The figures are still much higher than they were this time last year but the drop is encouraging. And of course the segment still generated $400 million in pre-tax profits for the company. While that may not be as high as last year that is still a significant sum. Ford Credit remains a cash-generating asset that brings tangible and intangible benefits to the company. Ford got absolutely hammered thanks to their lackluster numbers. It doesn't help that management was pretty negative towards the auto industry and the economy as a whole with management stating they felt we were at the top of the cycle. Some more positive comments from management could have the share price along a little bit but at least management isn't blowing. Ford Credit saw some metrics headed in the wrong direction but still remains a vital and profitable segment of the company. Unfortunately the company is guiding for lower numbers overall for Ford Credit compared to 2015 but will still contribute significantly to the greater business.
