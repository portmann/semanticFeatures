Why Ford Can Overcome Problems In China - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford’s sales in China have dropped as of late, as the overall auto market in the country has taken a hit due to a variety of reasons. The drop in commercial vehicle sales in China, along with pricing pressure on Ford’s models, could create short-term weakness for the company. Ford, however, should do well in China as it has just a 4.2% market share in the country, which means that it can gain share over rivals to increase sales. Ford is focusing on smaller cities in China by planning to open 85% of its dealerships in new cities this year, which will allow it to combat slowing sales to some extent. Ford is improving the presence of its luxury brand in China by over 4 times, a good move considering that the luxury market is expected to outperform the overall market. China's economic slowdown, regulatory restrictions, the stock market rout, and various other factors have contributed to the decline in vehicle sales in the country which boasts of being the largest automobile market since 2009. In fact, for the first time in over a couple of years, this year's June saw a year-over-year decline in new car sales. Additionally, in July, retail deliveries fell 2.5% to 1.3 million units. This was the lowest level of deliveries in the past 18 months. Also, passenger vehicle sales in China declined 6.6% to a 17-month low. All these numbers indicate that China's auto industry has hit a roadblock, which is bad news for Ford (NYSE: F ), as the company sells almost 18% of its global wholesale unit volumes in the country. As a result of the slowdown, Ford has been forced to revise its 2015 forecast for industry sales in China to 23 million to 24 million vehicles, which is less than its earlier expectation of 24.5 million to 26.5 million units that it had set at the beginning of the year. In July, while sales across the industry fell 7.1%, Ford and its Chinese joint ventures sold 77,100 vehicles in China, a decline of 6% from the prior-year period. Ford's sales had declined in June as well by 3%, following a 4% rise in the month of May. Thus, for the January to July period of 2015, Ford's sales figure in China is down 0.7% as compared to last year. This indicates that the efforts of the automaker to push its sales in China are not working as a result of the ongoing downturn. The drop in Ford's sales in China is a reason to worry for investors since the country accounts for a substantial portion of the company's sales as mentioned earlier. Additionally, sales of Ford's commercial vehicles in China, which account for 24% of its overall sales in the country, are not in good shape either. According to CEO Mark Fields , "We've seen commercial vehicles actually come down more the past year than other vehicles which is a bit of an indicator to us." Now, slowing sales of commercial vehicles are one of the indicators that point toward an economic downturn. This is because a slowdown in spending in the manufacturing and industrial segments leads to a drop in demand for CVs. Additionally, Ford is facing pricing pressure in China, as dealers are finding it difficult to move units in the current downturn. For instance, last month, the company was forced to cut the price of the Explorer SUV to the tune of 8% in China. Even then, there is a possibility that Ford might not be able to move the needle much in terms of sales since buyers are holding on for more discounts. Thus, Ford's prospects in China appear to be bleak, as the company might see a decline in both unit sales and margins. But, in my opinion, investors should not miss the bigger picture. Ford is still a small player in the Chinese auto market. It commanded just 4.2% of the Chinese market last year. This means that even though the Chinese auto market's growth has stalled, Ford can still grow its sales in this market by winning market share from its rivals. This is the reason why Ford is bringing new vehicles into the Chinese market, apart from increasing its capacity. For instance, Ford is increasing the number of Lincoln dealerships in China to 60 next year as compared to 14 in a bid to tap the long-term growth in the Chinese luxury car market. As Market Reports points out, the market for luxury cars in China is anticipated to increase at a CAGR of 12% until 2020. At the same time, Ford is tapping smaller cities and urban centers in China in order to improve market share. As a result, the company will open 85% of its new dealerships in China this year in these smaller cities, as they are growing at double the rate of bigger cities. This is a smart move from Ford, in my opinion, as the company will be able to benefit from broader growth of the Chinese market by not restricting itself only to big areas for growth. Though the Chinese auto market has hit a roadblock of late, Ford is taking steps to overcome the situation in a smart manner. Also, the fact that the company holds a small market share in China is a catalyst for it, as it can snatch market share from its rivals. This is why Ford is looking to tap growth in the smaller cities of China in a bid to keep its boat steady in the current environment. Hence, in my opinion, investors should not be discouraged by the recent downturn in the Chinese market, as Ford looks well positioned to improve its performance in the long run.
