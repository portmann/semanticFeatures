Why We Think Ford Is A Strong Buy - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford?s strategy is very sound and offers clear catalysts for profitability and share price growth. Ford has huge income appeal and has scope to increase dividends at an impressive clip. Investors in Ford (NYSE: F ) have a lot to be excited about right now. For starters, the company's retail automotive sales are at their highest level since 2004 after a strong September in which the company posted a 23% increase in US sales versus the same month last year. Furthermore, the release of the all-new F-150 pickup truck is likely to stimulate sales growth even further in the coming months and years. It remains the biggest selling vehicle in the US and, with an aluminum body and a more efficient engine option available, is likely to appeal to an increasingly 'green' US consumer. For example, 64% of sales of the F-150 last month were of its EcoBoost engine and, looking ahead, it would be of little surprise if an upward trend in this regard continued. This could cause an upgrade in Ford's earnings numbers and also improve investor sentiment moving forward. In addition to all-new engines, Ford is also focused on staying ahead of rivals when it comes to sustainability, with the company topping Interbrand's list of the 50 best global green brands in 2014. Examples of its commitment to sustainability include a partnership with Heinz (NASDAQ: KHC ) to investigate the use of tomato fiber reinforcement in sustainable, composite materials as well as Ford's bio-based portfolio, which now includes eight renewable materials for use in production vehicles. This focus on sustainability is likely to resonate well with an increasingly environmentally aware consumer, thereby strengthening Ford's degree of customer loyalty and positively catalysing sales in the long run. Meanwhile, Ford is also expanding its global reach with the release of new models in countries outside of the US. Certainly, the US economy is growing at an impressive clip and this is likely to act as a positive catalyst on Ford's profitability (and share price) in future. However, the European economy is also strengthening thanks in part to the ECB's adoption of quantitative easing. Therefore, Ford's decision to launch 24 new global products around the world in 2014 appears to be a sound one, with aggressive product acceleration in Ford's newest region, Middle East and Africa, having the potential to boost its top line in the coming years. And, while the Chinese economy's growth rate has slowed, Ford's decision to launch the Lincoln brand there opens up a new sales avenue for the business, which should provide additional diversification as well as higher sales and profit. Meanwhile, Ford's decision to invest a further $600m in its latest assembly plant in China means that it is committed to what is likely to be a major growth market for the business, with a rising middle class set to push demand for Ford's vehicles northwards. This, therefore, is likely to have a positive impact on the company's share price. As well as a sound strategy and clear growth potential, Ford also offers excellent income prospects. For example, it currently has a forward yield of 4% and it has rapidly increased dividends per share from zero in 2011 to $0.43 in the last year. This, though, still represents a rather modest payout ratio of around 58%, which we feel provides a sensible balance between rewarding the company's investors and also reinvesting for future growth. Of course, a higher payout ratio could be warranted, but with earnings per share forecast to rise by 13.5% in 2016, it seems likely that Ford's dividend will remain hugely appealing with US interest rates set to remain low and the S&P 500 yielding just over 2%. Therefore, we believe that investor sentiment and Ford's share price will move higher due to its considerable income appeal on both an absolute and relative basis. Based on its forward price to earnings (P/E) ratio of 8.8, Ford appears to be very cheap when compared to the S&P 500. It has a forward P/E ratio of 17 and so we think there is vast scope for an upward rerating to Ford's valuation over the medium term. In terms of potential catalysts to push it higher, Ford has strong bottom line growth forecasts for 2016, remains a top-notch income play and its business strategy seems to be very sound. Of particular note is the updated version of the F-150 which is due to become a bestseller, Ford's sustainability drive which is likely to improve customer loyalty and its aggressive growth strategy outside of the US, all of which we feel have the scope to push the company's share price higher moving forward.
