UPDATE 1-Ford declares new $1 bln dividend, 2016 profit outlook disappoints | Reuters Related: Stocks, Markets, Earnings, Cyclical Consumer Goods Jan 12 Ford Motor Co on Tuesday declared a $1 billion supplemental cash dividend but its outlook for 2016 profit failed to exceed Wall Street's estimates, sending its stock down in after-hours trading. The U.S. No. 2 automaker said it expected record 2015 pre-tax profit, excluding special items, in the "upper half" of its outlook for $10 billion to $11 billion. That is above the average analyst forecast of $9.4 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Profit for this year will be at least as high, excluding special items, said Ford. However, analysts are expecting pre-tax profit of $11 billion for 2016, on average. "Their guidance is in line or below what was expected," said Matthew Stover at Susquehanna Financial. Ford shares dipped about 1 percent from Tuesday's close to $12.55 in after-market trading. The $1 billion supplemental cash dividend, or 25 cents per share, is in addition to the first-quarter regular dividend of 15 cents per share, the same as in the first quarter of 2015. Ford paid $2.5 billion in dividends last year, up 20 percent from 2014. The Dearborn, Michigan-based company said the $1 billion supplemental cash dividend "reflects the company's strong financial performance in 2015 and robust cash and liquidity levels." He said analysts recognize that some U.S. auto dealers are "complaining about the market and the incentives" that automakers and dealers use to lower prices for new vehicles, which cut into company profit. At an industry conference in Detroit on Tuesday, Mike Jackson, chief executive of AutoNation Inc, the largest U.S. auto dealer group, said the peak of the industry's cycle has been reached and the start of a plateau began in the fourth quarter of 2015. Last year, U.S. auto sales hit a record 17.4 million vehicles, nearly breaking a record set in 2000. Last March, Ford's rival General Motors Co said it would buy back $5 billion worth of shares and distribute another $5 billion in dividends to shareholders by the end of 2016. "As we close out 2015, we are benefiting from six consecutive years of consistently strong results, and our performance is allowing us to reward our shareholders," said Ford CEO Mark Fields.
