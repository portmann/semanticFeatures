Almost exactly a year ago, the media world was abuzz when as we reported then , a picture posted by Ansar al-Din Front, an Islamic extremist brigade, and which promptly went viral showed a Ford F250 truck with a "Mark-1 Plumbing" decal on the door and a militant standing in the bed firing the anti-aircraft gun. And while most moved on quickly from this story, for one person the picture had a dramatic and scarring effect: the owner of said Mark-1 Plumbing company, a Texan by the name of Mark Oberholtzer, who as many know by now, is suing a Texas Ford dealership (Charlie Thomas Gord) for more than $1 million in financial losses and damages to his company's reputation, as a result of this pickup truck which he once owned, ending up with Islamic militants fighting in Syria's civil war. As CNN summarizes , "all Mark Oberholtzer wanted to do was upgrade his ride. What he got instead was a world of trouble from half a world away." "By the end of the day, Mark-1's office, Mark-1's business phone, and Mark's personal cell had received over 1,000 phone calls from around the nation," Oberholtzer's lawyer wrote in the lawsuit, filed December 9 in Harris County, Texas. "These phone calls were in large part harassing and contained countless threats of violence, property harm, injury and even death." Oberholtzer said this wouldn't have happened if the dealership had just removed the decals before the truck was resold, as he had demanded, thus serving as the basis for his lawsuit (attached below). But while we commiserate with Mr. Oberholzer, and wish him prompt restitution of damages as a result of unnecessary harassment, a far more important question is just how did Mark's 2005 Ford F250 Super Duty end up in under the control of the Islamic State. The answer would be critical, as it will provide a factual, tracable answer how it is that ISIS is if not funded (we know already revealed a critical part of that story), then supplied with equipment and perhaps weapons. This is what the plaintiff states in his lawsuit: According to a CARFAX Vehicle History Report (see Exhibit B), the vehicle was listed as a dealer vehicle sold at a Texas auto auction on November 11, 2013. On December 18, 2013 the vehicle was exported from Houston, Texas and imported to Mersin, Turkey. Presenting Mersin, Turkey, a stone's throw from the infamous port of Ceyhan and about a hundred miles from the territory of the Islamic State: On October 23, 2013, Mark Oberholtzer entered into a transaction with Charlie Thomas Ford, in which he traded-in his old 2005 Ford F-250 pickup truck for a newer 2012 Ford F-250 pickup truck. Promptly thereafter, the vehicle was listed as a dealer vehicle sold at a Texas auto auction on November 11, 2013 Less than a month later, on December 18, 2013 the vehicle was exported from Houston, Texas and imported to Mersin, Turkey. Less than a year later it was in the documented possession of the Islamic State. So once again the "missing link" supplying ISIS emerges as none other than Turkey. Meet The Man Who Funds ISIS: Bilal Erdogan, The Son Of Turkey's President Russia Presents Detailed Evidence Of ISIS-Turkey Oil Trade And while NATO-member Turkey supplying ISIS with funding, supplies, weapons or equipment is hardly groundbreaking news, the Ford "clue" poses new and important questions, such as: who is the Turkish party that ordered and paid for the Ford truck's transfer to Turkey, and subsequently received compensation from the Islamic State in the subsequent resale? which is the US party which transacts with Turkish counterparts, who ultimately ship US products to Islamic State fighters? is the US party aware that its Turkish counterparty has dealings with ISIS what is the role of the US government in all of this, because it would be surprising that an administration that has sworn it would crack down on all outside assistance to the Islamic State would be unaware that "made in the USA" trucks ended up in the Islamic State by way of its faitful NATO ally, Turkey. how many other such vehicles sold  in the US and exported to Turkey, have  made their way to the Islamic State We are confident that it will be relatively easy for any aspiring reporter to track down the US-based exporter of the Ford truck (and thus recipient of Turkish funds), just as it will be facile to uncover who was the Turkish buyer who signed the receipt invoice in Mersin, Turkey. What may be more difficult to uncover is whether the governments of the US and Turkey, respectively, were or are appraised about transactions such as this one, and if not, then why not? We hope to be able to answer as many of the above as possible in the very near future.

All the US propaganda, about Putin is total BS. Putin was not your typical KGB type and was constantly criticized for refusing to join The Communist Party, and for being an Russian Orthodox Christian. In fact, prior to enrolling in Military College, he spent almost a year studying for the Priesthood, as his whole family, were devout Russian Orthodox Christians. If he hadn't been one of the best assassins KGB Counter-Intelligence had(36 confirmed Western agents), he would have never, even made the rank of LTC. The fact he was never a Communist or in the KGB hierarchy, was why Gorbachev named him to Lead The KGB during the conversion from The KGB to The FSB, in 1992. Tue, 12/15/2015 - 16:09 | 6927394 nuubee That may all be true, but exactly how long has he been the leader of Russia? Was he elected to that position repeatedly? All that said, I still have far far far more values in common with Putin than I do with the Chinese communist party, or anyone in the middle east.

Go figure-- it runs on either hydrogen, gasoline, or E85. I returned it to the dealer yesterday because I couldn't get the radio to work.   The service technician explained that the radio was voice activated.   "Nelson", the technician said to the radio.   The  radio replied, "Ricky or Willie?"   "Willie!" he continued and "On The Road Again" came from the speakers. Then he said, "Ray Charles!", and  in an instant " Georgia On My Mind" replaced Willie Nelson.   I drove away happy, and for the next few days, every time I'd say,  "Beethoven", I'd get beautiful classical music, and if  I said,  "Beatles", I'd get one of their awesome songs.   Yesterday, some guy ran a red light and nearly creamed my new Ford truck, but I swerved  in time to avoid him.  I yelled, "Ass Hole!" Immediately the radio responded with, "Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States ."   Damn I love this Ford truck.. But is that a new kind of sewer router they have on the back of that truck in the picture?

BTW, speaking of truck decals; reminds me of when I had a Jeep Wrangler green, 4-cyl but put the Sahara logo and pinstripes decals on to make it look like the upmarket 6-cyl model.  Didn't remove it upon trade in to the Toyota dealer in Atlanta...  and the salesman well, decided to cut corners... imagine that.

WAS HE ELECTED TO THAT POSITION? Look around you! All the weasel-dicks in American politics and European politics were elected to their positions! Obviously, being elected is a sure sign you're a jerk, a dolt, an oaf, a fool and a pluperfect villain! He's a demagogue! HE'S A DEMAGOGUE? What American politician isn't a demagogue? Get it straight, Nutbag! No one cares what your opinion is because your obtuseness forfeits the right to have an opinion. You are what I'd call a typical "voter". Tue, 12/15/2015 - 16:11 | 6927399 beemasters Nah...Then we wouldn't know where the trucks that ISIS had came from? It was sweet that he didn't remove it or the truth would have remained hidden. Tue, 12/15/2015 - 16:39 | 6927543 TuPhat The dealership asked him not to remove the decal just to be sure he wouldn't scratch the paint.  They promised to do it themselves prior to resale.  That's according to ABC news channel 13, Houston.  Don't ever trust a car dealer. Tue, 12/15/2015 - 16:44 | 6927563 sapioplex Olberholtzer was quoted as saying that the dealer instructed him to not remove the decals (that they would remove them) for fear of damaging the paint.

Tue, 12/15/2015 - 16:01 | 6927348 beemasters The bigger question is: Of all [nearer] places from which they could have imported trucks, WHY the US??? Who was facilitating it? The CIA? Tue, 12/15/2015 - 17:05 | 6927553 beemasters The first thing an intelligence agency would have done when they see  such a photo should have been to follow the breadcrumbs, question and possibly charge those involved...but of course if you wouldn't do that if you are to implicate yourself. C'mon, CIA, FBI, Homeland...please own up. Who had instructed you to look the other way? We need names....NOW!! *waterboarding* Tue, 12/15/2015 - 16:51 | 6927606 NoDebt If the CIA didnt buy and ship it themselves directly just running it through (ally) Turkey to get it in theatre quickly.  Tue, 12/15/2015 - 16:51 | 6927607 FreeMoney We know ISIS has the truck.  We dont know exactly how they got the truck.  Maybe they bought it, maybe it was gifted to them, maybe they stole it.   We do know someone bought it at an auction and then shipped it to turkey. I would think a person in Turkey would have less expensive options for a used F250 4x4 type truck.  Mercedes, Fiat, Volvo are all made much closer to turkey than Houston, TX.  It doesn't make sense to buy and ship somthing with out local dealer support or locally available spare parts.  Smells like month old fish.

Tue, 12/15/2015 - 15:54 | 6927309 Deathrips But today I just realized that Jihad and Mein Kampf literally mean the same thing.  Tue, 12/15/2015 - 16:03 | 6927363 Miles Ahead Tue, 12/15/2015 - 16:26 | 6927459 Miles Ahead I think you mean "ideology".  Anyway, there's no support to the fallacy that Hitler supported Genocide.  He was actually working with the Zionists to repatriate all Jews out of Germany to wherever.  Could be called ethnic cleansing perhaps.  But then there goes your argument about Jihad.  Jihad (struggle) is just an arabic word.  There's not a wee bit of implication for "ethnic cleansing" or genocide. Also there were Jewish troops - senior, decorated even - in the Wehrmacht.  Look it up.  Can't have that and genocide together.  Difficult. "most Germans" and "all Islamists".  Your arguments are shallow.  Move along. BTW, Jihad was started by the USA son.  As a rallying cry for fighters to help out against the Soviets in Afghanistan.  Nothing related at all to Genocide, again.  The connotations can be varied. You do know by the way, that Arabs use Arabic words, don't you?  So if they want to say "struggle" they sure ain't going to say "kampf". Or lutte.

No, it was pillows.  They were turned into pillows for German wives.  And paper weights (shruken heads).
