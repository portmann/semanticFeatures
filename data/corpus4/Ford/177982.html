Ford, GM, Both Or Neither | Seeking Alpha Automobile and light truck sales in the US have been on the upswing lately. Both Ford and GM reported significant sales increases last quarter. The 2009 financial crisis took a toll on US automakers. While Ford (NYSE: F ) made it through the crisis without assistance from the US government, GM (NYSE: GM ) went through a debt restructuring and received assistance from the US government. Both companies also received concessions from the United Auto Workers (UAW) and exited the financial crisis as smaller and more nimble companies. Auto and light truck sales in the US experienced a major decline during the financial crisis and are have been on a slow recovery since. Automobile and light truck sales in the US are up this year and, if the July and August sales pace holds up, it will be a banner year for US auto sales. August sales came in at an annualized rate of 17.81 million units. The last time US sales were this high was in 2005. The mix of vehicle sales in the US this year so far has been dominated by light truck and SUV at the expense of traditional cars as well as electric vehicles and hybrids. The table below shows the mix of vehicle sales in August. All of the car and minivan segments were down significantly while pickup and most SUV segment sales were up significantly. Not broken out separately in the table above, plug-in EV sales fell off significantly from the August 2014 pace. The August 2015 estimate of EV sales came in at 8972 versus 12,172 a year ago, a drop of roughly 25%. Tesla (NYSE: TSLA ) sales are running roughly 20% below last year's pace. One explanation for the shift in sales away from small and midsize cars towards SUVs and light trucks is the price of gasoline which is down to about $2.15 per gallon in my area. Cheap gas equates to more people buying larger vehicles. This should be good for Ford and GM as both earn significantly higher margins on their larger vehicles though both will have to figure out how to move their vehicles from other segments as well. Overall, it should be a good year for US auto manufacturers as the consumer seems to be in a buying mood and the average age of vehicles on the road in the US is over 11 years. Overall revenue for GM has been slowly trending up over the last 5 years while Ford revenue has been generally up over the period but with some variability. For 2015, the analyst consensus is that GM revenue will come in at $151.2B, a decline of 3% from 2014. Ford is expected to achieve $138.5B in revenue, an increase of about 2% over 2014. For 2015, the EPS consensus estimate for GM was $4.52 but that was before GM settled its case with the US Justice Department. GM recently announced that it would take a charge of $575M against third quarter income which will reduce 2015 EPS. GM did not indicate how it would disposition the remaining settlement amount of $325M ($900M total) but I'd expect that GM will take another charge against fourth quarter earnings. Charging the total $900M against 2015 income will drop expected EPS to about $3.99 per share. Even with this most recent write off, GM's EPS is expected to be up almost 142% over the $1.65 per share earned in 2014. Note that GM also took a non-recurring charge against earnings in 2014 of $1.40 per share. Without that non-recurring charge, GM would have reported earnings of $3.05 in 2014. Ford's 2015 consensus estimated earnings per share is $1.70 versus $1.16 in 2014, an increase of almost 47% over 2014. Earnings for 2015 for both companies are expected to be up substantially. Both GM and Ford have been struggling with negative operating cash flow with Ford struggling more than GM on this front. As a result of running negative cash flow and continued capital investment, both companies have been growing their total debt. Based on expected revenue and income for 2015, GM and Ford may be able show positive operating cash flow. GM's debt has been rising much faster than has Ford's. However, GM has a distinct advantage here as it went through a managed restructuring in 2009 and was able to shed much of its large debt burden. GM's debt to equity ratio was a modest 1.10 as of the end of 2Q 2015 while Ford's ratio stands at 4.69. Both GM and Ford carry a just barely investment grade credit rating from S&P of BBB-. Both companies are looking for an upgrade to their credit rating with the expected improved financials in 2015. The automobile market in the US is highly competitive with several large and strong companies vying for market share. The graphic below shows the change in market share of US auto and light truck sales from 2010 through June of 2015. Both GM and Ford have seen their market share continue to shrink while the new Fiat/Chrysler Group has picked up additional market share. There are a number of smaller manufacturers not included in the graphic above that have also picked up market share in the US, namely Hyundai, Kia, and Subaru. All three have aggressive marketing and sales campaigns to further cut into the market share of their larger peers. This does not bode well for continued growth in GM or Ford. The current high pace of auto and light truck sales in the US is raising the fortunes for GM and Ford in 2015 but will not likely be sustained. In order to grow, both Ford and GM have to regain lost market share in a very competitive market. GM just recently reinstated its dividend in March of 2014 at an annualized rate of $1.20 per share and raised it once to a current annualized rate of $1.44 per share. That dividend provides a yield of 4.7%. Ford reinstated its dividend in January of 2012 at an annualized rate of $0.20 per share. Ford has raised its dividend three times since reinstatement to a current annualized rate of $0.60 per share. At that rate, Ford's dividend provides a current yield of 4.2%. Ford and GM have managed to recover significantly from the 2009 financial crisis and have recently reinstated their dividend payments. Income or dividend growth investors may be tempted by the currently healthy dividend and increased sales volume to add Ford or GM or both companies to their investment portfolios. I will be continuing to watch and monitor the financial performance of both but I am not comfortable recommending either company for conservative investors (of which I am one) at this time. I'm in the "neither" category. Both companies continue to lose market share to able competitors. While 2015 may be the year of the turnaround, both companies continue to struggle with negative operating cash flows and continually increasing debt to equity ratios. While GM just recently settled its criminal charges with the US Justice Department, it still has the overhang of several lawsuits associated with the ignition switch recall to work through. Finally, the UAW and Fiat/Chrysler have negotiated a new contract which will raise the cost of production for the big three automakers going forward. I believe it is too early to invest in either GM or Ford, at least for me. I'm going to watch and wait to see if either or both of their financial recoveries has staying power.
