Ford's F-150: Do New Incentives Signal Bad News For Shareholders? - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford investors have been inundated with negative sounding headlines about incentive selling of the flagship F-150. Looking behind the headlines shows less reason to panic. This doesn't change a key part of our long thesis; that Ford will continue having success with both its F-150 and Mustang. Those that read us regularly know that there are several components to our long thesis on Ford (NYSE: F ). Second, we believe the company's bet on itself (allocating capital to innovation and global expansion versus giving it back to shareholders) will pay off in global growth. In turn we expect this to generate net income far in excess of expectations, which we believe will be the one catalyst that can push the stock higher. Third, we think there is a strong backbone of sales domestically that we expect to hold up. Fourth, even stronger are the company's two new offerings in the F-150 (with new aluminum body) and the Mustang (now being sold globally in areas where it previously wasn't available). If one of these key components of our thesis were to change, it would necessitate us taking another look at the company. Recently, some headlines gave us pause and caught our attention. We wanted to run through them at length and see what they meant for our thesis. Causing a stir recently was a report that Ford was hacking $10,000 off the price of its F-150. This is extremely alarming wording for those long Ford, especially those who count on the F-150 to be a big part of their backbone of their long thesis, like us. It just doesn't make sense; the F-150 seemed to be so well received. Could it be time to panic? We think not, and here's a couple of reasons why. Average prices remain high at $44,100 and the company's data shows that the F-150 sits on the lot at about half the time as average inventory. To put it concisely, sales are still rolling along strong. The $10,000 figure is bologna. Only in certain parts of the country, while taking advantage of all available potential configurations and options, is this available. The company is not hacking off $10,000 from every F-150, despite what the headlines make it look like. The company says the average incentive is just $3,100; big difference. Much of the incentives that are being talked about aren't specific to the F-150. They're being offered as Ford Credit incentives, like the company's offer to get $2,500 cash back when using Ford Credit. The company has been upping its production. In the business, incentives are relatively common. Sales run at certain holidays and down times, and it's just a feature of the business. Like retail., there's generally always an incentive being offered. Put simply, this is a case of having to look behind the headlines. We are actually encouraged by the way the F-150 continues to sell. The company's success in Europe, which we wrote about days ago, also continues to support our thesis. The company trades at a very attractive 0.41x price to sales, and a respectable 2.3x their book value. At about 7.8x what Ford is expected to earn next year, nothing about Ford's valuation seems overdone in a market where we believe that equities are starting to push their upper limits valuation wise. Ford's EV/Sales of 1.13x is extremely attractive. While it's worth continuing to watch, we think these F-150 headlines are false alarms. We are still bulls on Ford and think the best days in the company's history are ahead of it. Source: Ford's F-150: Do New Incentives Signal Bad News For Shareholders?
