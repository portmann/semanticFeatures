Ford In 2016: Growth In India And Green Tech Investments - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. Ford just launched two new subcompacts which have the best price and the highest quality in the segment. Consumers will compare and choose Ford. Figo comes in the lowest trim level with driver airbag, Aspire with both driver and passenger while Maruti cars come with neither. Ford is well prepared to handle the newest CO2 regulations and avoid fines in the USA and the European Union. With Russia, the Middle East and South America affected by the commodity crisis, the most important challenges for car manufacturers in the next few years will be riding in the growth wave of China and India while transitioning to low CO2 cars in the USA and Europe. China and India are the most promising emerging markets for cars: their economies are not dependent on the price of commodities and their car sales are growing fast. Ford (NYSE: F ) has plans to tackle both markets and while a lot is discussed about China, there is a lot less information about the also very relevant Republic of India. The country's GDP is expected to grow above 7% per year in 2016, 2017 and 2018 and new car sales should average 11% in the period. Besides that, it is very important that due to its low production costs, the south Asian country is a major exporter of cars to other poor countries. Ford India currently exports 40 percent of its engine production and 25 percent of its car production to countries such as Nepal, South Africa, Kenya, Bahrain, Angola, Bermuda, Ghana, Iraq, Liberia, Lebanon, Malawi, Madagascar, Mauritius, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, UAE, Zambia and Zimbabwe and expects to triple that with a new factory in line with Mr Modi's "Make In India" programme. On the other hand, new car sales are also doing very well in the United States and the European Union, but in both of them new CO2 emission regulations will make car manufacturers work around the clock to avoid the huge fines which will hit those that do not adapt. Consumers themselves will have to change as the regulations will make petrol engines more expensive, while huge subsidies are being provided for electric cars. Besides those specific factors that I detail in this article, in a general way Ford is also a good buy for 2016, as one can see in the table above: Ford has the third largest operational cash flow of the segment ($15 billions), the fourth largest revenue ($114 billions) and a net profit of $3 billion dollars which are more than enough to pay one of the largest dividend yields, at 4.2%. The current price of $14.3 is also attractive considering that the stock traded between $13 and $16.5 in the last 52 weeks. Ford has a lot of room to go higher, a decent dividend and doesn't have much downside risk. Taking into consideration the low oil price which is predicted to stay for some years yet, the growing car sales in the European Union ( 8.7% for the market in the 11 months to November and 21% for Ford in comparison with 1 year ago ), the growing car sales in the USA ( Ford sales increased by 13% in the first 10 months of the year ) and the fact that Ford is a large corporation which is taking the right steps for the future, it is hard to see why the stock would have a market fall in the next year. Only a fall in the stock market in general, perhaps prompted by a global recession, would cause that in my opinion. Chart of Price/Cash Flow for Ford and S&P 500. (Source) As for the potential upside, as one can see Ford's cash flow had a market improvement in the last three years, while the stock is at the same level as in the beginning of 2013. One should note, however, that Ford's earnings didn't grow nearly that much and are somewhat smaller in comparison to its cash flow than the numbers in similarly sized car manufacturers such as Toyota and Volkswagen. This emerging market for new cars has recently been dominated by Maruti Suzuki ( OTCPK:SZKMY ), Hyundai, Toyota, Tata and Mahindra, but Ford is determined to change things and to achieve this, it recently launched three new cars: Figo, Figo Aspire and Endeavour which will join the already successful Ecosport. Figo is a budget subcompact hatchback, Aspire is a budget subcompact sedan and Endeavour is a large 7-seater SUV. Figo Aspire and the small SUV Ecosport will be built in the new factory in Gujarat which cost one billion dollars. Ford already has a plant in Chennai, but decided to open a new one in a different location because the new one will be one of its most heavily automated in Asia, employing 2,500 people, half as many as the old one, while producing a similar amount of cars. This will double Ford's production capacity in India to 610,000 engines and 440,000 vehicles a year and will also triple Ford's exports and the highly mechanized factory will be a key competitive advantage going forward. Figo and Aspire are cheaper than rivals while providing the same fuel efficiency, a stronger engine and superior technology, while the Endeavour is expensive and targets richer Indians with something that few rivals offer: A luxury 7-seater. In the lowest trim level Aspire offers both a driver and a passenger airbag, while the market leader provides neither and is more expensive. Indian consumers will compare and there is no reason why they should keep buying Maruti Dzire when Ford Aspire offers a better and cheaper product. Honda Amaze does have a larger boot, but this is at the cost of less internal space. The Aspire also offers slightly more powerful engines while providing the same fuel consumption, so the only reason to remain with the Dzire would be either looks, something very personal, or the lowest cost of repair due to more mechanics being familiar with Maruti. Similarly in the market of subcompact hatches, Ford Figo is the cheapest and offers a driver airbag in the lower trim level while the leader, Maruti Swift, doesn't. With 240 thousand deaths per year in car accidents in India, the fact that the New Figo is a much safer car than the Maruti Dzire, which received zero stars in NCAP crash tests , should be a compelling argument for consumers. On paper Figo's sales dropped in 2015, but the New Figo was introduced in September and we should see a different picture in 2016. Ford is clever to attack the Subcompact market while avoiding getting into the super cheap van and city car markets already dominated by other companies. Focusing on a few successful cars is better than having lots of uncompetitive offers. The competition is not sleeping, and while Ford Ecosport previously dominated the small SUV market unchallenged, in 2015 Hyundai launched Creta to challenge it and it did take a chunk of its sales despite being more expensive. Maybe consumers were looking for a larger car? Summing up, despite the dominance of Maruti in the market, Ford is coming hard with a more automated factory, with better safety and most important of all the cost-conscious Indian consumers will be attracted by its lower price and I see no reason why they shouldn't migrate to Figo and Figo Aspire. Ford preparing itself for California's Zero-Emission Mandate and CO2 Markets Another issue for the future are CO2 regulations and Ford is very well positioned to avoid taking fines from both Zero-Emission Mandate States and from the Obama administration's CO2 Market. Considering Ford USA sales of 2.3 million vehicles Jan-Nov 2015 and that approximately 17,000 of those were plug-in vehicles, and that only 8 states have ZEV mandates, this gives Ford a 2.2% share of plugins in its fleet in ZEV states. This is much better than Toyota and second only to Nissan. Note that after 2018 the Zero-Emission Mandate will no longer consider conventional hybrids, such as the standard Prius, as valid for obtaining credits. Ford also recently announced $4.5 billion in investments in electrified vehicles , which should allow it to keep up with the new regulations. The official targets in the USA are indeed quite excessive but being a leader should give Ford a lot of room to maneuver, as those on the bottom will desperately beg the government for smaller targets. The company also plans to license more than a thousand hybrid and EV patents for others, allowing it to profit from latecomers. Ford does have to pay hybrid-technology patent fees to trolls, but so does Toyota, and having its own patents should neutralize the negative effect of the trolls. Electric and Plug-in Hybrid sales in the USA. Source: http://evobsession.com/ The company is a little less focused than the competition, launching a lot of green cars with average sales instead of only one with good sales like Nissan does with the Leaf. I guess it is experimenting and trying to find the best position to take in this market. Something really positive for Ford going forward is its push to take a large chunk of the emerging market of India. At the same time the company is also investing in the technologies of the future such as electric and hybrid plugin cars to avoid the heavy fines which would hit it in both the United States and the European Union otherwise. This, combined with the fall in the price of oil and the rising car sales around the world make Ford my best idea for going long in 2016. It is well positioned to profit in the short term, but is also investing in future growth, which is exactly what one should expect from one's holdings. Tagged: Investing Ideas , Consumer Goods
