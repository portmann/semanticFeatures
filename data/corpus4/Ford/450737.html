null Prosecutors on Tuesday declined to charge Edsel Ford II, a member of the board of directors for Ford Motor Co and the great grandson of company founder Henry Ford, after he was earlier arrested, city officials said. Ford, 67, was expected to be released after prosecutors decided not to file misdemeanor domestic violence charges following an altercation with his wife late on Monday at his home in Grosse Pointe Farms, a police officer said over the phone. "Charges were not authorized," a Grosse Pointe Farms court official said over the phone. Director of Public Safety Daniel Jensen said the case was sent to the city attorney following the "very minor" physical assault but that there was not enough evidence to pursue charges, the Detroit Free Press said in a reporter's tweets posted on its website. Ford was elected to the board of directors in 1988 and is married with four sons, according to a biography on the company website. "We are aware of what has been reported in the press, but it would be inappropriate to comment on personal matters," a Ford company spokeswoman said in an email.
