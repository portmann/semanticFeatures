Ford & GM have at least 25% upside - Barron's - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Apr 17 2016, 07:29 ET | About: Ford Motor Company (F) | By: SA Eli Hoffmann , SA News Editor Sales at Ford (NYSE: F ) and GM (NYSE: GM ) are booming, but you wouldn't know it from their share prices, Barron's says in a bullish cover piece this weekend. Key concerns include a drop from Q1's torrid sales pace (both slid when March sales came in at a mere 16.56M (annualized)); weaker China growth; rising buyer incentives; and subprime loans. But investors fail to appreciate the degree to which the two have achieved efficiencies since the last cycle. "That means it can sustain profitability - and show good profitability - late in the sales cycle,"  Annie Rosen, manager of the Fidelity Select Automotive Portfolio, says. Ford trades for 6.6x 2016 earnings and 3.9x projected cash flow; GM fetches 5.6x and 3.4x. Barron's thinks shares have 25% upside in the coming year, not including dividends of 4.9% for GM and 4.6% for Ford. In the case of GM I do not see how the upside could be any less than 20% given that the company is buying back roughly 20% of the outstanding shares. If gas prices remain muted, compared to a couple of years ago, the mix of vehicles sold will tend to be skewed to SUV's and trucks which result in higher profit. If GM raises the dividend modestly each year for the next few years how can the stock not rise by 30%. Additionally the dividend expense will be kept in check given the large share buyback. The analysts uniformly are skeptical of Ford and GM because of the 2008 recession, as well they should be. Unfortunately the only way Ford and GM will earn their respect back is for the country to go into a recession. Ford and GM can then prove that they have set their companies up to remain profitable during downturns, only then will we see a substantial increase in PE multiples. Not sure if purchasing 20% of shares instantly equates to a 20% rise in price but it helps boost EPS. Either way it does appear both companies learned something. I'm sticking with Ford for both stock and vehicles. I know it's silly and irrational but I don't like how GM handled and was handled by the government. About a month ago 25-30% of Wall Street thought a recession was imminent.  Since than we don't here too many talking about recession anymore.  The economic data has been good here and in China.  The stumble in March may be just that or a start of something else, what we really need to see is April car sales.  Now if they get the SAAR back to 17.3 million or more than March does look like the flooding in the South and the early Easter may be what caused that stumble.  However if April comes in below 17.0 - look out below. I think that we will be in for a few years of basically up and down months as the SAAR rises to 18.5+ by 2018. RUWC, I think you've nailed it, and it's not just the 2008-2009 recession. Quoting Alan Mullaly from the book American Icon, chiding his management team" you guys have been going bankrupt for the last 30 years". No doubt multiple near death experiences are heavy on investors minds, but this time I feel it's different. Take this time as a gift and accumulate and drip on the cheap.
