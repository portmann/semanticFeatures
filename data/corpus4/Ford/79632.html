Chesapeake Energy: Eagle Ford Could Help Stop The Falling Knife - Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE:CHK) | Seeking Alpha After falling to a 52-week low, is Chesapeake Energy a falling knife or a good contrarian play? The Eagle Ford shale could help Chesapeake stem the slide in its stock price while setting the stage for strong liquids growth in the future. After burning through $1.2 billion in cash in Q1, Chesapeake is well aware that it needs to dramatically cut back its drilling operations. As West Texas Intermediate [America's crude pricing benchmark] and Henry Hub [America's natural gas pricing benchmark] collapsed from late-2014 to 2015, it took Chesapeake Energy Corporation's (NYSE: CHK ) stock price right along with it. WTI fell from $100 a barrel in the middle of 2014 to under $50 by early 2015, with Henry Hub falling from $4.50 mmBtu to under $3 mmBtu. Chesapeake Energy Corporation's stock price fell by around 50% over that time frame. This could be a classic case of a falling knife that could continue to cut into investors returns, or it could be a good contrarian play that might sharply rebound given the chance [if natural gas and oil prices rise]. There is also a lot of upside to be had, regardless of where prices go in the short-term, from Chesapeake Energy improving its Eagle Ford operations. Chesapeake Energy has long been primarily a natural gas producer, but in light of the Appalachian pricing differential [around ~$1 per mmBtu] and low domestic natural gas prices [ see natural gas surplus ], management decided to move into the liquids rich Eagle Ford play down in Texas. Recently, Chesapeake had some pretty good news for investors. Downspacing tests [reducing the distance between well laterals] have been a success as production levels matched those of its previous wells as depicted below. These downspacing efforts were able to increase Chesapeake Energy's potential drilling inventory in the Lower Eagle Ford by 600 - 700 locations, boosting it to ~4,500. Additional tests are in the works, including 250-foot spacing , to see if that could be increased further. Management stated this during its UBS Global Oil & Gas conference presentation: What's fantastic about these locations is that we added them with virtually zero acquisition costs. So, really strong for us as we've added years of inventory to our Eagle Ford drilling program. Successful downspacing efforts effectively boost the value of Chesapeake's acreage and grow its growth runway for far less than if Chesapeake was to go out and acquire additional acreage. Another way management hopes to grow Chesapeake's growth runway is by testing out the Upper Eagle Ford interval. By Q4 2015, Chesapeake will begin drilling its first Upper Eagle Ford well. Many other players in the industry have been able to bring reasonably productive wells online in the Upper Eagle Ford horizon, including Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE: MRO ). Marathon Oil was able to bring five wells tapping into the Upper Eagle Ford in Q1 2015, with the 30-day IP rates of those wells ranging from 648 BOE/d - 1,248 BOE/d . Room for improvement, but not a bad start. Another way Chesapeake Energy is seeking to optimize its drilling program is by extending the horizontal reach, or lateral, of its wells. By increasing its well lateral length to 10,000 feet from 5,000 feet in the Four Corners oil weighted area, Chesapeake can boost its EUR [estimated ultimate recovery] rate from 439,000 BOE to 772,000 BOE. This helped reduce Chesapeake's Eagle Ford well cost per BOE recovered from $12.30 to $9.33. The higher recovery rate is half of the equation, and the other half is that it costs Chesapeake less per lateral foot to drill and complete an extended lateral well. On a 5,000-foot lateral, it costs Chesapeake $1,080 per lateral foot, which goes down to $720 per lateral foot on a 10,000-foot lateral. Management noted that XL wells have a payout rate that is roughly twice as fast as its normal wells in this part of the Eagle Ford. With 600 potential drilling locations capable of handling XL wells, Chesapeake has plenty of room to see if its initial results can be replicated elsewhere. This is definitely something to watch as Chesapeake Energy plans to makes drilling XL wells in the Eagle Ford [and elsewhere] a priority going forward due to stronger well economics. Chesapeake may also end up testing out wells with significantly higher lateral lengths than 10,000 feet once it gets a better handle on drilling and completing XL wells. The longest well lateral Chesapeake Energy has drilled so far in the Eagle Ford was 10,300 feet long. Another benefit that is also somewhat of a curse is that even as Chesapeake Energy reduces its rig count, it may end up drilling more wells than its revised guidance suggests due to much faster drilling times: The biggest challenge that we've got right now is we cut costs, but our teams are doing so fast, that a rig that used to drill 10 wells is now drilling 12 wells. So we'll continue to just watch it as it progresses but you get some capital pressure when your wells are drilling faster. Example of that is the Eagle Ford. We had 20 rigs going. Our top core - so the difference between our top quartile rigs and our bottom quartile rigs was 20% percent or more. So when we pull down our rig count to our top quartile rigs, they are drilling 20% faster by default, not to count all the other innovations that they are continuing doing. So that's the challenge for us is we'll continue to see cost reductions, but I think we'll drill more wells than we anticipate as well. With $10.6 billion in long-term debt and $2.9 billion in cash at the end of Q1 2015, Chesapeake Energy's debt load is something to be wary of. During the first quarter, Chesapeake burned through $1.2 billion in cash to supplement its cash flow streams. However, there are reasons to believe that this picture will improve throughout the rest of the year. WTI has rebounded substantially, which will push up Chesapeake's realized crude and NGLs [natural gas liquids are generally priced at a percentage of WTI] prices. Henry Hub prices have slipped a bit which will reduce some of its pricing cash flow gains. What will really help out is the sharp reduction in its spending levels throughout 2015 as it winds down drilling activity by reducing its rig count. Source: Chesapeake Energy Corporation Presentation By the end of the year, Chesapeake Energy should be able to at least bring its spending levels close to being in line with its cash flow streams. It really comes down to where WTI and Henry Hub prices go, but management is well aware of the reality that it needs to cut back. Worse case scenario, Chesapeake always has the option to sell off some of its acreage or producing assets if it becomes that desperate. Chesapeake Energy Corporation is a risky investment, but it might be one worth taking a closer look at now that its stock price has fallen down to a 52-week low. There is a chance that its Eagle Ford operations and efficiency gains could help stem the slide in its stock price while Chesapeake Energy sets the stage for strong liquids production growth when its needed. Even if oil and/or natural gas prices don't rise from their current levels this year, there is always 2016 to look forward to. American LNG [liquefied natural gas] exports are guided to start-up in early 2016 while natural gas continues to tap out coal to generate electricity. Petrochemical expansions will also drive demand for natural gas higher through the end of the decade. On the oil front, a combination of higher demand [particularly from Asia] and slower supply growth [due in large part to curtailments in Canada and America] could result in marginally/mildly higher prices by 2016.
