ETF Hub Nov 20 2015, 19:25 ET | By: Carl Surran , SA News Editor The United Auto Workers union ratifies a four-year labor agreement with General Motors (NYSE: GM ), after most rank-and-file GM workers voted in favor of the new contract two weeks ago . The new contract, which goes into effect on Monday, calls for raises for all workers and the end of the two-tiered pay system; average labor costs, of which pay is nearly half, for GM workers will be $60/hour by 2019, up from $55 now, according to a new study by labor analysts released today. Meanwhile, the UAW is racing to save a proposed labor deal with Ford (NYSE: F ) that would mark a significant setback if rejected; a vote today at a Dearborn, Mich., plant is considered critical, and earlier plant  tallies had contract opponents leading by ~1,500 votes. Not so fast Tdot.  This Detroit Free Press article indicates that things may not be as dark as you think.  Here is a quote from the article: "Itâ€™s a close vote," Nick Kottalis, chairman of UAW Local 600's Dearborn Truck Plant unit, said Friday afternoon. "It's the last day of voting on a national contract and it's close, so naturally tensions are high." Fork workers voting against this deal are only hrurting themselves. When those vehicles do not hit the showroom on dealerships. the layoffs will begin. Senior workers voted in favor of the contract at Ford while younger members rejected it. Doesn't bode well for the UAW if they can't unify their own members. im pro union and the contract looked very good.send the ignorant and ungrateful ones out on strike for awhile and see how fast they accept a lesser contract. they seem to have forgotten that they were fully trained in a week and anybody off the street can replace them in a weeks time.heck id go so far as to say there is someone else who love to have thier job How do you know how all Ford workers can be replaced and trained in a week? Of course others would like their jobs.  There are millions who would like their jobs and yours for less money Interesting point truth.  The story is that if the contract is rejected, it reverts back to the status quo 2011 version, and everything new in the 2015 version is off the table, including all the negotiated bonuses, pay raises, benefits, the 8-year growth path from the lowest to the highest tiers, and all the job guarantees and investment plans for US factories.  And Easter Monday.  And the Ranger and Bronco that were supposed to be built at Wayne Michigan as the UAW went around bragging about (which Ford never confirmed by the way), they could get crossed right back off the product plan. Got to hand it to the UAW membership.  Even they don't realize how badly they screwed up.  You get a couple of crazies that are satisfied with nothing short of killing the goose to get at the golden eggs, and those radical nuts ruin it for everyone. Strangely like the radical Tea Party wing, which has done everything they can to destroy the republican party and conservative objectivism. I know  trust me I know.ive worked allmost every job on an assembly line! well I suppose if your stupid it make take longer to train you but most jobs are mastered within 2 days exactly right tdot. ive worked those jobs and walked the picket line and you are spot on however you can not pass on knowledge to most young people as they are emotionally underdeveloped and must learn everything for themselves usally the hardest and most painful way possible I cannot fathom paying someone $60.00 per hour to put a car together. No wonder more automation is needed, after all $15.00 to press buttons to make burgers. LOL, not. What did you expect with the UAW owning a big piece of GM?  What did you expect with the UAW at war with Ford because of all the employee perks Ford has provided without influence from the union.  Hell - the union has veiled threats to Ford to back off all the uncalled benefits or there will be trouble. Having friends in the lower Lake Michigan area, I got the word that this is all about insuring GM breaks the long term standing of Ford selling the most trucks.  Most investors are driven by fear as are all who lack knowledge.  In this case a strike is a good choice to achieve it's goal, but Ford and I know that this particular goal will net - net hurt the wage earners at the absolute worst time. Everyone is talking and yet union management is gloating about screwing the employees.  What - do people really believe these scumbag rednecks don't talk openly?  Ford spends pocket change annually to pay properly vetted salaried staff to frequent favorite wage employee hangouts - just like Chrysler and GM and likely most others.  I understand this practice is quite well established. It is just like the Russians and the Americans, they provide each other breathing room in the spying business to avoid surprises. lets hope cooler heads and rational thought will prevail. its a win win for all involved. it cant be only one winner, all sides and factions must give and take.hopefully this will pass and the tier workers will be at top pay in the near future ETF Screener: Search and filter by asset class, strategy, theme, performance, yield, and much more ETF Performance: View ETF performance across key asset classes and investing themes
