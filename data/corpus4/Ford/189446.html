Sometimes it feels almost like an act of divine intervention. Not because of the divinity of it, but because of the intervention part. Itâ€™s almost as if I were a conduit for a guy (at least I hope itâ€™s a guy) inside my head trying to communicate with my readers. I sit down to write, and letters spill into words and then into sentences, and then I see these new ideas and find myself thinking, â€œWow, I wish Iâ€™d thought of this!â€? After I submitted  my previous column , on the financial innovation taking place at Apple, I learned that Sprint, T-Mobile and now Verizon are all fighting to best one anotherâ€™s iPhone offers. What is really amazing about the situation is that no matter how this war among wireless carriers plays out, there will be one clear winner â€” Apple. And in the end, the carriers will be collective losers â€” theyâ€™ll be killing their margins to out-subsidize one another. They will be spending millions of dollars on advertising to get customers to come to their stores to buy â€” yes, Apple iPhones. If consumers choose Appleâ€™s iPhone Upgrade Program instead of the carriersâ€™, then Apple will win even bigger (as I argued in that column). In the meantime, 2015 will likely mark the year that AT&Tâ€™s and Verizonâ€™s U.S. wireless service businesses went from growth to stagnation. Another observation about  Apple : Its brand extends far beyond technology and coolness. Over the years, the company has accumulated incredible goodwill with consumers. There is only one other company that comes to mind that has generated a similar amount of affection: Amazon.com. Amazon made shopping online easy, its customer service is impeccable, and it is transparent with consumers about pricing. After all, it allows other merchants to sell their merchandise through its website. Amazon will even ship it for them. Consumersâ€™ trust in Amazonâ€™s pricing is so great that most people donâ€™t even bother with comparison shopping anymore; they skip Google (which is not good news for Google, by the way) and go directly to Amazon. I recently found myself willing to pay a few dollars more on Amazon than on a competitorâ€™s website because I knew that if I needed to return the product, the process would be seamless. That goodwill turns Apple and Amazon into â€œplatformsâ€? (a very trendy word on Wall Street now), allowing them to launch a wide variety of new products. When Apple comes out with the Apple car, rumored to be due in 2019, it will be able to grab a disproportionately large market share from the General Motors of the world because of that deep well of goodwill. By the time my youngest child, Mia Sarah, who is almost two, learns to drive, internal combustion engines will likely be a relic consigned to museums (just like Fordâ€™s Model T). I had an â€œaha!â€? moment when I recently visited a  Tesla  store and saw its carsâ€™ power train. It looks just like a skateboard â€” it basically consists of a flat slab of metal (which houses the battery), four wheels and an electric engine the size of a large watermelon. Thatâ€™s it â€” the Tesla has only 18 moving parts. I donâ€™t know how many moving parts an internal combustion engine (ICE) car has, but it must be hundreds if not thousands. Interestingly, ICE cars also have more electronics than a Tesla. Wall Street is going gaga over the stocks of dealerships (especially after Warren Buffettâ€™s Berkshire Hathaway bought Van Tuyl Group) and car makers. I am in the minority, but I think that party will come to an end. Just like Tesla, Apple is not going to be using a dealership model to sell its cars. It would not want the Apple car buying experience to be tainted by a sleazy car salesman. Just as with the iPhone, the company will want to have complete control of the buying experience. If both Tesla and Apple bypass the dealership model, the GMs of the world will be at an even larger competitive disadvantage. They will have to abandon the dealership model too. Yes, I know, selling cars directly to consumers is not legal in many states, but if the U.S. Constitution could be amended 27 times, the law on car sales (which is an artifact of the Great Depression) can be amended as well. The traditional dealership model is unlikely to survive anyway, as its economics dramatically degrade in the electric-car world. A car that has very few moving parts and minimal electronics has few things to break; and consequently, electric cars will need less servicing â€” throttling the dealershipsâ€™ most important profit center. The baby boomer generation romanticizes cars. Most boomers can recite the horsepower and other engine specs of every car they have ever owned. For the tail end of Gen X (my generation) and Millennials, a car is an interruption between Facebook  and Twitter. We know the brand of speakers in our car, but if asked would have to google its horsepower. We feel little romanticism for our cars and have much higher brand loyalty to Apple and Google than to GM or Ford. What is also amazing about electric cars is that they arenâ€™t that much different from smartphones. Smartphone prices have declined significantly over the years because their components became ubiquitous and commoditized. With the exception of spark plugs and tires, most components of a GM car will be different from the ones youâ€™ll find in a Ford. The opportunity for scaled manufacturing and so commoditization is very limited in the auto industry. The simplicity of electric cars and the declining ambition of Tesla, Apple and whoever else enters that space to be known as a â€œcarâ€? company will likely lead to commoditization of components and thus lower prices. Tesla today is more a software and battery company than a car company. (As we recently discovered, Volkswagen is a lot more of a â€œsoftwareâ€? company than we thought.) Think back eight years ago to the day when Apple introduced the iPhone. No one suspected that it (and the smartphones that followed) would enable a service like Uber , which is busy putting cabdrivers worldwide out of business. The unforeseen consequences of the advent of electric cars will reverberate much farther than the demise of dealerships and significant shifts in market share in the auto industry. Gasoline can only be made from oil. (Yes, there is ethanol, but the economics of ethanol in the U.S. are problematic.) Sources of electricity are diverse â€” natural gas, coal, nuclear, solar, wind, hydro, oil (and Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™m forgetting something). Seventy percent of oil goes into cars and trucks. Just imagine for a second the shifts in global political alliances if oil lost its luster. The U.S. might forget how to spell â€œSaudi Arabia,â€? and the Middle East might start looking very different. Apple may find its 2019 date for the Apple car to be a bit optimistic, but nevertheless, its entrance into the auto industry will likely be successful and very disruptive. After all, it has the much-needed software know-how to design a car (it is already working with car companies on CarPlay, the iPhone-centered car infotainment system), it boasts a global network of stores, it has a deep well of goodwill with a billion fans globally, it possesses unlimited resources ($150 billion of net cash, and it generates $50 billion of free cash flows a year), and its imagination has not been damaged by decades of producing cars with internal combustion engines. Let me stress that last point. There is a very good reason why Nokia, which at one time was the dominant cellphone manufacturer, failed to compete with Appleâ€™s iPhone. It had too much institutional knowledge. It had hundreds of engineers who tried to add IQ to a dumb phone. They were attempting to convert Symbian, a dumb phone operating system, into a smart phone operating system. Despite Apple showing Nokia how the smartphone should look, they couldnâ€™t see their product as a smartphone but rather just as the next iteration of a dumb phone. General Motorsâ€™ answer to Tesla was not any different from Nokiaâ€™s response to the iPhone. GM came out with the Chevy Volt, which was really one of its internal combustion engine cars with an electric engine dumped in. Unless an ICE car company creates a silo unit isolated from the rest of the operation, it will be very difficult if not impossible to get engineers who have designed ICE vehicles all their lives to suddenly change the paradigm of their thinking and turn into electric-car engineers.

Also all my electricity comes from green energy suppliers (wind, solar, natural gas) and its only 9 cents a kilowatt, $5 a week.

I wouldn't bet on this if I were him.  Granted, electric autos are going to make big strides in overall market share over the next 10-15 years or so but there are still a couple of big obstacles to electrics supplanting internal combustion engines within that time frame; #1 - battery/energy storage technology still is no-where near that of gasoline when it comes to driving range, particularly when overall cost is considered (i.e. really advanced battery technology is REALLY expensive - even the "old" technology lithium/ion batteries used in cars like the Tesla cost about $10,000 or more to replace) and #2 - there is something called the oil/energy cartel in the the USA (and the world) and they will not give up their sales and profits related to vehicle fuels without a HUGE fight.  Keep in mind these are the same guys that colluded with the auto and tire manufacturers to get rid of the street cars in Los Angeles in the 1940's - they will not think twice about doing something similar to retain their position if they are threatened by the wide-spread use of electric vehicles. Thu, 10/01/2015 - 19:56 | 6618565 poland spring Thu, 10/01/2015 - 21:04 | 6618818 Dickweed Wang So let's say you are 5 miles from a gas station (or an electric outlet) and your car runs out of juice.  With an internal combustion engine car you walk 5 miles and get a can of gas . . . what do you do with an electric vehicle??  Get out your solar panel and wait for three days to allow the batteries to charge??  And "range anxiety" (if there was such as thing) is no myth - the only electric vehicle widely available today that has over a 75-80 mile highway range is the Tesla (the Nisan Leaf's advertised range is about 80 miles but in tests it has been shown to be closer to 40 miles - that SUCKS!!!) - and the Tesla starts at around $60,000.  People are not going to buy into electric vehicles if on a 300 mile trip they have to stop at least three times (minimum) and wait for hours each time to charge up their batteries or you have to pay at least twice as much for an electric car (as opposed to a nice gas powered car) with adequate range to be useful for more than going to the grocery store. Don't get me wrong here either, I'm all for electric cars and think they have great potential.  My point was/is that in the near future I don't think electrics are going to be able to take away a huge amount of market share from gas powered cars due to limited range and cost.  Who knows, there could be some kind of breakthrough to change that but that's when I think that the Exxon/Mobil boys are going to step in to make sure the existing paradigm continues on . . . There is no such thing as FREE.   -ONLY an a criminal or an idiot thinks so... Someone is paying, someone's being gouged to mark up the priofit and the difference in distribution and infrastructure, etc., even if you aren't being told who it is or how the wealth re-distribution that you perceive as FREE to YOU is being done... The oil/energy cartel in the USA, or the elites that derive their income from them, will take over electric/renewables. I feel convinced that if we stay on the current trajectory we will at somepoint have commoditized the sun, water, and air Thu, 10/01/2015 - 20:42 | 6618737 MalteseFalcon Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! 10-01 21:03: Samsung Electronics (005930 KS) to use Qualcomm (QCOM) for next model... 10-01 21:03: Australia private new home sales rose 2.3% M/M in August 10-01 21:03: Australia sells AUD 900mln 2.75% 2019 bonds, bid to cover 4.08, yield... 10-01 20:30: New Zealand ANZ Commodity Price (Sep) M/M 5.50% (Prev. -5.20%) 10-01 19:39: Volkswagen Canada offering 'unprecedented' incentives,... 10-01 19:39: On The Fly: After Hours Movers 10-01 19:39: DISH says FCC to retain certain licenses from AWS-3 spectrum auction 10-01 19:39: JPMorgan preparing $18B bid for U.K. mortgage pool, Bloomberg says 10-01 19:39: Ethan Allen Elects Tara Stacom to Board of Directors 10-01 19:39: Benzinga's M&A Chatter for Thursday October 1, 2015 10-01 18:33: Microsoft, ASUS broaden patent licensing engagement 10-01 18:00: PDC Energy Extends Maturity of its Revolving Credit Facility to 2020 with Re-Affirmed Borrowing Base of $700M 10-01 18:00: Sprint Corp.
