NuStar is a well-run LP that has covered the distribution this year and will likely do so again in 2016. However, falling Eagle Ford production is expected to negatively affect pipeline volumes going forward. While new storage projects and the lifting of the export ban are bullish for the operations in Corpus Christi, debt maturation in 2018 is a concern. The 11.6% yield may not be worth the risk if Eagle Ford production continues to decline due to the low price of oil. My first article on NuStar Energy L.P. (NYSE: NS ) back in May of 2014 highlighted the partnership's turnaround efforts combined with its Eagle Ford shale growth initiatives as positive catalysts going forward. Since that article units are down 32%. What happened? Primarily, the drop appears to be due to a broad market sell-off in practically any "energy" related equity. However, there is reason for concern due to lower production out of the Eagle Ford shale. Meantime, NuStar has been posting very solid quarterly results and nicely covering its distribution - which is now an outsized 11.6%. So what is the market telling unit-holders? Is the distribution safe or does the smart money know something dangerous is lurking on the horizon? The NuStar partnership consists of two publicly traded companies. The organization is nicely summarized in this graphic taken from a company presentation at a Wells Fargo conference this month (available here ): The general partner ("GP") is NuStar GP Holdings (NYSE: NSH ) which holds the obligatory 2% GP interest in NS along with 13% of the LP units. The LP has approximately $3 billion in debt and currently has a debt to market-cap ratio of ~1x. 8,700 miles of crude oil & refined product pipelines Terminal and storage assets are diversified geographically across the US, the Caribbean, the UK, and Amsterdam. The fee-based Pipeline & Storage segments have contributed ~98% of 2015 EBITDA year-to-date with the Fuels Marketing segment chipping in only 2%. As a result, NS's EBITDA is nicely insulated from weak commodity price exposure. That said, as explained below - lower oil prices have led to decreased production from the Eagle Ford shale and has affected NS's growth trajectory. As mentioned earlier, NS has about $3 billion in debt. From the latest 10Q (available here ) we can see that there are no near-term maturities to cause alarm bells to go off: However, about $407 million of NS's long-term debt matures in 2018, and another $908 million will be due in 2019. More than half the long-term debt does not come due until 2020 or thereafter. Roughly 57% of the $3 billion is financed at an average rate of 6.4%, with the remainder borrowed at a variable rate which currently averages a mere 1.4%. Seeking Alpha contributor 'Arbitrage Trader' recently wrote an excellent article on NuStar Logistics' subordinated notes. NS is the parent guarantor of the notes. In addition, for NSS interest payments to be deferred, NS has to also suspend its dividend. As a result Arbitrage Trader did some research into NS and concluded: "NS has a very solid history of generating positive cash flow per share and is a constant dividend payer. In fact this is one of the limited partnerships that is not experiencing a sharp decline in revenue and seems a good enough "buy" itself based on past performance." While top line revenue was down significantly yoy, so too were operating costs and expenses - both drops due to divestitures and discontinued operations. But note the YTD bottom line numbers are solid: net income per unit was $2.69 - up 72%. EBITDA and DCF from continuing operations is up 24% and 10%, respectively. As noted in the press release, results were goosed by a one-time gain related to the January 2, 2015 acquisition of the remaining 50% ownership in the Linden terminal. Regardless, yoy bottom line results would still have been nicely higher. On a segment basis, despite falling onshore shale oil production this year, NuStar's pipelines delivered increased crude and refined product throughput during the quarter and yoy. Higher utilization rates in the storage business combined with the increased Linden capacity contributed to a 17% increase in storage lease revenue for the quarter. YTD results for both the pipelines and storage segments showed solid growth: Due to continued strength in NS's core, fee-based operations, the coverage ratio for Q3 was 1.05x - the partnership's 6th consecutive quarter above 1.0x. In summary, the Q3 EPS report was solid - as they have been throughout 2015. As discussed earlier, NuStar runs a fee-based business with only the small Fuels Marketing segment (~2% YTD EBITDA) being directly exposed to commodity prices. At the end of Q3, NS's storage terminals were effectively full (93% utilized). Pipeline revenue was 94% contracted out on long-term take-or-pay contracts with a diverse number of high quality refiners, large integrated and national oil companies. 95% of tariffs are FERC-based and are adjusted annually for inflation. As a result, NuStar's contracted revenue profile is stable and secure. That said, in the Q3 Seeking Alpha transcript , President and CEO Brad Barron commented that: "... approximately 65% of our South Texas pipeline throughputs are committed under long-term take-or-pay contracts with strong credit-worthy customers, who are actually shipping well above these minimum thresholds." That means ~35% of current South Texas revenue could drop without take-or-pay relief. And roughly 25% of total pipeline revenue are Eagle Ford volumes to refiners or to the docks at Corpus Christi. Since we know Eagle Ford production is declining, let's take a look at the impact on NuStar's potential growth versus earlier expectations. As shown on the slide below taken from a Wells Fargo presentation this month, and as predicted in my first article on NuStar, the Eagle Ford and South Texas pipelines delivered excellent growth through Q1 of this year - when lower commodity prices and lower production began to took a bite out of volumes. Through Q3, volumes were down ~15% from their peak: While the company expects volumes to grow in 2016 over Q4's forecasted level, I'm not so sure. If there is no oil price recovery next year, a continuation of the trend line could lead to a decline in total volumes to an average of ~180-200,000 bpd by during 2016. That's an estimated 28% decline from Q3 and remember, that's close to the amount that isn't covered under the current take-or-pay contracts. The drop is because total Eagle Ford production has been declining for some time now. This indicates that production from new wells being drilled cannot keep pace with declining production from old wells. As can be seen from graphics taken from the latest EIA report on the Eagle Ford shale (through November), the rig count in the play has collapsed as has legacy oil production from existing wells. As a result, total oil production in the Eagle Ford was down 77,000 bpd month-over-month to just under 1.2 million bpd. That is a drop of over 25% from the play's peak production. The relatively high decline rate of legacy shale wells likely means lower volumes going forward. Considering the price of oil dropped further in December, odds are good the decline in Eagle Ford production may not only continue, but could accelerate. As a result, I question NuStar's guidance on the South Texas pipelines' volumes barring a significant increase in the price of a barrel of oil in 2016. In the Q3 release, President and CEO Brad Barron said: "We expect increased throughputs on our refined product pipelines to be largely offset by lower projected Eagle Ford crude oil system volumes. As a result, our pipeline segment's 2016 EBITDA should be comparable to slightly higher than 2015." He also said NS expected the Storage segment's 2016 EBITDA to decrease $15 to $35 million compared to 2015. This was primarily due to lower projected storage throughputs at the North Beach terminal that serves the South Texas Pipeline System. So the CEO is guiding to lower volumes on the South Texas Pipeline System - I just question the actual expectations versus the graphic above which shows average 2016 volumes higher than Q3 2015. That appears to imply a significant increase in the price of oil during 2016. But things are not all bad. A recent RBN Energy article ( Condensate Export Dock Facilities Ready To Roll In Corpus Christi ) shows NuStar holds the leading position in exports on the docks of Corpus Christi: NuStar is able to load Panamex class vessels due to its docks' favorable placement near the mouth of the channel. NS has the capability to load 65,000 barrels per hour across its three docks and has the capacity to move 350-400,000 bpd. In April, NuStar loaded a record 220,000 bpd. Now that the US has lifted the crude oil export ban, NuStar's Corpus Christi terminal is a positive catalyst. However, it remains to be seen just how big a catalyst it will be in 2016 considering production drops across the Eagle Ford. In addition, NuStar completed construction of an additional 400,000 barrels of storage at the Corpus Christi Northeast terminal during Q3. This is a positive catalyst moving forward. All in all, NuStar appears to be headed for relatively flat EBITDA growth in 2016. Based on forecasted 2015 capex and the expected 2016 budget, spending next year is expected to be ~$70 million lower than the current fiscal year. While that is certainly a welcome development, it may not be enough to move the needle considering the $407 million of debt maturing in 2018. With the looming debt maturation, and slowing pipeline volumes on the South Texas pipelines, it appears the fall in the units and rise in the yields are due to the dependency of an oil price rebound to ease debt concerns. The market apparently does not see a price rebound anytime soon. Even though the debt maturations don't hit for two years, the partnership needs the increased cash flow the growth projects it financed were supposed to provide. To put some numbers to the potential lower volumes from the Eagle Ford risk: if the total South Texas pipeline volumes continue to fall to the midrange of my 180-200,000 bpd estimated average for 2016 (190,000 bpd), that would be a drop of 73,000 bpd over Q3 - or about 7% of total pipelines volumes as compared to Q3. Since these volumes would likely not be covered by take-or-pay contracts, it would lead to an estimated $9.6 million drop in quarterly revenue and ~$5 million drop in operating profit. With a coverage ratio of only 1.05x for Q3, that change would be enough to threaten a 1x coverage (all else being equal). So it will be extremely important for NuStar to add additional refined product pipeline volumes to make up for a drop in Eagle Ford volumes should the downward trend from that play continue. Meantime, costs for NS's variable rate debt could increase from their very low-levels if the Federal Reserve continues raising rates. However, any increase in interest rate expense is likely to be minimal over the next 12-months. NuStar is a well-run outfit and will likely cover its distribution again next year - but it likely will be close if the refined product throughput does not grow as expected. That said, NuStar's growth trajectory has definitely and substantially been altered by falling production in the Eagle Ford shale. Volumes from the Eagle Ford could drop ~35% without take-or-pay contractual coverage. While the Corpus Christi export terminal and new storage capacity additions are a bright spot, management's forward guidance appears to indicate Corpus export growth may take a while to kick in. As with so many other energy related equities, NuStar's future is tied to a price rebound in oil which would lead to increased Eagle Ford production. If the rebound doesn't come, management may need to issue more units to raise equity capital. Considering the drop in the unit price this year, that would be a negative development - not to mention dilutive. While the current 11.6% yield may not qualify as the proverbial trap door, considering distributions should be covered next year, investors should take a pass on NuStar due to the looming debt issue and expected drop in Eagle Ford related pipeline volumes.
