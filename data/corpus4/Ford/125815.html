Ford's Strong Second Half Is Setting Up - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford saw a 1.5% increase in US auto sales in June 2015 compared to June 2014 as the new F-150 aluminum-bodied model continued to see tight supply levels. The Ford Mustang saw the strongest June sales since 2007. With Ford expecting to reach full inventory levels in September, it remains well positioned to take advantage of the growing US auto industry in the second half of 2015. Ford (NYSE: F ) announced June 2015 US vehicle sales of 226K, up 1.5% from the same month in 2014. This 1.5% increase came in slightly below the 2.3% increase estimated by analysts. Ford's 1.3% year-over-year increase came despite overall US auto sales crushing expectations for the month with industry-wide growth of 3.9%. With the poor winter weather behind consumers and gas prices remaining low, analysts are expecting 2015 sales to be 17.2 million, which would be the strongest year in a decade. Despite another miss compared to analyst expectations, Ford believes a strong second half is coming as the new aluminum-bodied F-150 pickup is reaching full production levels for the first time all year. Based on this, I believe Ford June was the beginning of the lagging turnaround. The Ford F-150 production is continuing to ramp up the Kansas City assembly plant, which is expected to reach full production levels later this quarter. The Ford F-150, which underwent a drastic model change to an aluminum body starting with this year's model, has seen tight inventory levels so far as the company has worked to configure their manufacturing plants. Because of the inventory constraints surrounding the new F-150 model, the company has not utilized heavy incentives to sell older models like competitors. Because of this, the F-150 saw another record setting average transaction price during June 2015. Additionally, the new F-150 is seeing positive consumer reactions when it makes it to the customer lot with a quick turnover time. According to management, the new F-150 is turning twice as fast on dealer lots than the industry average for half-ton pickups. This turnover time bodes well for the company going forward as management said the company only had half of their normal inventory levels on dealer lots in June. While this is encouraging, it is disappointing that management doesn't expect to have to reach full supply levels until September. Despite this setback, I continue to be optimistic of Ford's future because I think it is important for Ford to get this product launch right as they are taking the F-series brand in a new direction designed for better fuel mileage. With optimal inventory levels expected in September, I think it's important to look at the quick turnover time of the model and the very strong US auto market. Both of these indicators are signs of a positive second half of 2015 for the F-150 and Ford as a whole. In June 2015, the US auto consumer continued the shift back to less fuel-efficient vehicles in response to the falling fuel prices. This shift in consumer sentiment will boost sales for the company's higher profit margin vehicles such as the F-150, Explorer, and Expedition. The Mustang saw another impressive month in June, consistent with early 2015 results. Mustang sales were at their highest June level since 2007 and continue to build its case to reclaim the title of bestselling muscle car in 2015. This is a title the company has not held since before the 2010 Chevrolet Camaro was introduced. During June, Mustang sales were up 54% with 11,719 Mustangs sold. I believe the sports car segment will continue to see rapid growth as the weather warms and the US economy improves. Ford is certainly losing ground to competitors due to the inventory restrictions. Generally, a lot of times a customer will purchase a vehicle when needed instead of waiting for the newest model. This has been seen in the performance of Chevrolet's Silverado and GMC's Sierras, which combined saw more sales than Ford's F-series in May and June. Furthermore, GM's (NYSE: GM ) two full-size trucks together are expected to outsell the F-series this year for the first time in five years. However, this is not the big picture an investor should be seeing when buying shares of Ford. They should be seeing management's plan to shorten the company's normal summer shutdown in order to increase production. This shows me as an investor the new F-150's results are positive and the high end models are selling well, which is creating a lot of optimism around the new model going forward. Once full production capacity is reached, I fully expect Ford to start leading the pack. Given this long-term optimism with Ford, I am not too worried about monthly US sales figures as long as they are not catastrophic. I continue to be excited about the company's future as the new aluminum bodied F-150 is nearing full production levels, the recent shift in consumer sentiment to higher profit margin vehicles, and the strong sales of the Mustang. With consumers purchasing more expensive vehicles, it will allow Ford to report stronger top line and bottom line growth in the second half of 2015. I remain bullish on the US automobile industry and believe Ford has a strong product mix to take advantage of the growing market. I will continue to enjoy the near 4% dividend yield as the company prepares to be successful in the long-term.
