The Tesla CEO and Bond villain-come-to-life gave an interview to German newspaper Handlesblatt. While the chat centered mostly around Tesla’s issues in Germany and Elon’s hope that the German government will start handing out the kind of tax breaks that he’s getting back on US soil, the interviewer apparently couldn’t help asking about “The Apple Car.” [Handelsblatt]: Apple just hired some of Teslaâ€™s most important engineers. Do you have to worry about a new competitor? And Elon apparently couldn’t help responding like the catty president of the hottest sorority on campus. [Musk]: Important engineers? They have hired people weâ€™ve fired. We always jokingly call Apple the â€œTesla Graveyard.â€? If you donâ€™t make it at Tesla, you go work at Apple. Iâ€™m not kidding. That was just minor-league shade compared to what else Elon had to offer on that merry band of morons in Cupertino. [Musk]: Did you ever take a look at the Apple Watch? (laughs) No, seriously: Itâ€™s good that Apple is moving and investing in this direction. But cars are very complex compared to phones or smartwatches. You canâ€™t just go to a supplier like Foxconn and say: Build me a car. But for Apple, the car is the next logical thing to finally offer a significant innovation. A new pencil or a bigger iPad alone were not relevant enough. Snidely “congratulating” Apple on its innovation while also saying outright that the company wouldn’t know how to build a car if the ghost of Henry Ford walked them through it step-by-step? But buried inside that lava hot diss track is the fact that Elon is also a man of grand ambition and big ideasÂ whoÂ can’t help but begrudgingly respect Apple’s ambitions… Especially considering how f*cking dumb they are.

Maybe you should have fired those guys instead? High-Frequency Monitoring: A Short-Sighted Behavior The more frequently you monitor your portfolio, the more likely you are to observe a loss. This is likely to cause short-sighted decisions and could hurt your investment performance. If you are checking your portfolio more than once per quarter, youâ€™re doing it too much.
