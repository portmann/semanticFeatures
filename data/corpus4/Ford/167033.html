How Ford Can Get To $20 Per Share - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford shares are over 20% off their 52-week highs following the recent market downturn. U.S. sales are still going strong, and launching a wave of new models last year should free up capital going forward. The right combination of dividends, share buybacks, and debt reduction could push Ford shares to $20 in the next couple years. The past year has not been kind to Ford (NYSE: F ) shareholders with shares off over 20% from their 52-week highs. Concerns over a slowdown in China and an upcoming Fed rate hike have hurt markets recently and pushed Ford shares to the low end of their long-term range. But Ford sales are still strong and if the broader economic environment cooperates, good execution and capital returns could push shares to $20. While unlikely to push shares to $20 on its own, earnings growth will be a key factor in pushing shares higher. Currently, analysts are forecasting $1.69 in est. 2015 EPS, $1.93 in est. 2016 EPS, and $2.16 in est. 2017 EPS. Investors are discounting these future earnings over concerns that they may never materialize in the previously-troubled auto industry. But if Ford can meet expectations, it will have demonstrated a couple more years of profitable strength allowing it to get a valuation closer to 10x earnings, pushing shares to around $21.60. However, achieving this multiple will likely take more than just greater earnings and could incorporate the three concepts discussed below. Although Ford's stock has underperformed, the dividend has been a source of strength for investors. Currently yielding 4.4%, Ford pays a sizeable dividend in the current low interest rate environment. While this is a sizeable dividend, the market has already factored it in and dividend investors are looking for dividend growth as well. To boost the share price higher through dividends, the dividend will need to move higher from here. Fortunately for Ford investors, the company has a history of raising its dividend at the beginning of the year which it has done every year beginning in 2013. If Ford continues its pattern of raising the dividend by $0.025 per quarter at the beginning of each year, the quarterly dividend would rise to $0.175 per share beginning in 2016. This would give investors at current prices a 5.2% yield on cost. If the market adjusts Ford's share price to keep the yield the same, shares could rise 17%. With the payout ratio at 58.3, I don't expect Ford to move the dividend dramatically higher. However, the increasing earnings trajectory combined with much of the model refreshing capital spending being done last year should allow Ford to continue doing incremental annual dividend increases. These moves will demonstrate management confidence and attract dividend growth investors - two factors beneficial to the share price. The recent market downturn has negatively impacted current Ford shareholders but it does present an opportunity for the automaker. While General Motors (NYSE: GM ) was buying shares back before the downturn racking up significant paper losses, Ford could begin a buyback at the current lower market levels. Now that the previous heavy development spending has passed, Ford will have more cash to fund shareholder capital return programs. The initiation of a share buyback would offer a signal of confidence from management, while at the same time, increasing every shareholder's slice of the earnings pie. And at the current low forward P/E levels, buybacks would be highly accretive and could grow the effect of higher earnings on the share price. Many investors have been calling for Ford to reduce its debt levels and I believe some debt reduction would be beneficial. Lowering the debt level would help de-risk the company as an investment as well as lower interest payments. However, the debt picture at Ford is not as bad as many people believe. Ford Credit carries the vast majority of the debt with much of the debt directly secured by borrowers' cars. Ford Automotive only has about $14 billion of total debt and actually has net cash of around $8 billion. The company has already noted that it intends to lower Ford Automotive's debt level to $10 billion by 2018, which I view as a positive development. While debt reduction has many positives, it is not necessarily the best use of capital if the interest rate is low. In the case of low interest debt such as the ATVM loan from the Department of Energy, it would make more sense to repurchase cheap shares carrying a 4.4% dividend than pay down the loan early. Nonetheless, strategically retiring a modest amount of debt could help bring more conservative investors to Ford's shareholder base. These investors are typically willing to accept a higher valuation in exchange for greater security making them more likely to push shares higher than if the shareholder base was just speculation and value investors. Ford shares have had a tough time making gains but earnings growth should provide a favorable background for the company. In addition to growing earnings, the automaker will need to attract investors through already implemented debt reduction plans and expected dividend increases. Investors could also see additional upside if Ford were to launch a modest share buyback to reduce outstanding shares and signal management confidence.
