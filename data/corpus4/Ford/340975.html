Ford's China Fake Out - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford puts up great numbers in China for February, alleviating concern about the company's poor January numbers. This data follows strong results in the U.S. to start off 2016. With the market looking like it's not going into full-fledged "recession" mode, we continue to like Ford here with a multi-year hold thesis. We almost couldn't have timed it any better. It was just last week that we came out with our latest bullish article on Ford ( F ), a company that we have been bullish on for the better part of two years now. Last month's China numbers made it look as if Ford may have hit a roadblock. This month's numbers tell us just the opposite. Today, we have additional data from the all-important Chinese market that seems to corroborate our thesis that the company, despite the narrative placed on it by the market, is doing just fine. After Ford had a slowdown in China during the month of January, this morning's data shows that the company bounced back with a fantastic February in the extremely important country of China, which arguably represents Ford's most lucrative global market. According to Seeking Alpha , here is the data we received this morning, Ford ((NYSE: F )) reports sales in China are up 18% YTD to 194,182 vehicles. The Changan Ford Automobiles JV has generated sales of 160,119 vehicles, while the Jiangling Motor JV is in with 31,309 vehicles. Sales in China were down 9% during February. Ford Escort sales are up 15% YTD to 13,173 vehicles. All the while, we continue to hear that U.S. automakers are getting "run over." We don't think so. Those that read us regularly understand that we follow these monthly metrics for a snapshot into the company's business in between its quarterly filings. We feel that monthly auto sales data gives us a great look into the current health and vitality of the company, without having to wait for three months of rolling data in quarterly reports. These fantastic numbers from China show the payoff for Ford's continued commitment and investment in the Asia region. Ford has spent billions to try and give itself an international footprint, and it has spent the most in the Chinese market, due to its massive populous and strong advertising requirements. As we have stated in previous articles, Ford has created a brand inside of its brand in China, and the company spends as much focus on marketing and advertising in that market as it does anywhere else in the world. Again, as we have been saying for two years, the international outreach is where the company is going to be able to juice its profitability, as long as sales domestically continue to hold. This is what we believe we are seeing happen right before our eyes. This news, of course, follows news we wrote about last week regarding the company's United States auto sales. When checking in with United States auto sales, we found that the company continues to have a strong backbone intact for domestic sales, with SUVs and pickups leading the charge. It has been a bit taxing to write about Ford for the better part of two years, where the share price has basically just gone lower over that time. But as we have said from the first article that we wrote, we had a multiple year thesis on Ford that involves holding the stock and reinvesting dividends. For those that have taken this strategy, you likely bought stock at prices underneath today's price while reinvesting. We think buying today and locking in a yield of well over 4% is a smart move for any dividend portfolio. We think appreciation of the stock back to previous levels of $17, where we felt it was underpriced, is going to leave you at least 20% upside from here. From there, we believe the stock can and will move higher as the company proves on a quarter-by-quarter and year-by-year basis that it is capable of continuing to execute. For those who are worried about subprime risk in auto financing, we proposed in our last article to short Credit Acceptance Corporation (NASDAQ: CACC ) and go long Ford as a pair trade. CACC is a company that "provides automobile dealers financing programs, and related products and services that enable them to sell vehicles to consumers. It advances money to dealers in exchange for the right to service the underlying consumer loans; and buys the consumer loans from the dealers and keeps various amounts collected from the consumers." In other words, CACC backs all of the auto finance industry's loans, and would make for a great hedge to short if you are a nervous investor regarding the subprime lending happening in the auto sector. Of course, with the way the market is looking over the last week, it appears the US could be avoiding going into a full-fledged recession. This would only be good news for United States consumers and we think that this should help support Ford stock on a go forward basis. Even if the market does correct slightly, Ford is a name that we don't mind being in because of the company's great financial position and its dividend. We recently said that rather than a recession, this was likely a "stock picker's market" and Ford is a company that we continue to maintain as a great long-term hold.
