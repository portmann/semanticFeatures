Three Recalls For One ford recall Recall Safety vehicles fires brakes airbags deployment issues Incorrectly positioned airbags, heaters that can cause a fire, and parking brakes that can fail. Those are three things you probably donâ€™t want to occur in your vehicle. But for thousands of Ford ownersÂ it’s a possibility and the carmaker has issued three recalls to fix things.Â  Ford announced Thursday that it would recall 48,300 vehicles for a range of safety issues. First up, the automakers will recall 37,905 model year 2015-2016 transit vans equipped with airbags that may not work properly. According to Ford, the side-curtain airbags may be positioned incorrectly. In the event of a crash, the airbags may not deploy correctly, increasing the risk of injury to passengers. The company says it is unaware of any injuries or accidents related to the issue. Owners will be notified and dealers will inspect and adjust the side-curtain airbags to correct the position. The second recall involves 5,500 model year 2015 to 2016 Lincoln MKC and model year 2016 Ford Explorer SUVs that may contain block heaters that can overheat and possibly start a fire. Ford said itâ€™s aware of two reports of underhood fires in Canada, but is not aware of any accidents or injuries related to the issue. Owners will be notified of the issue and dealers will replace the heaters with an updated design. The final, and smallest, recall covers 4,800 model year 2015 to 2016 Ford F-650 and F-750 trucks that may contain a broken parking brake cable connector clip. In some vehicles, the parking brake connector clips were not manufactured to the correct specifications and could break â€“ resulting in unintended movement of the vehicle and increased risk of injury, Ford says. The company says it is unaware of any accidents or injuries related to the issue. Dealers will replace the connector clips.
