Why Ford Will Get Better In The U.S. - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Fordâ€™s performance in the U.S. in August was ahead of expectations, as sales of its pickup trucks gathered impressive momentum, with the F-Series crossing the 70,000 mark for the first time in 2015. Ford will improve the capability of its pickup trucks and lower costs by building engines in-house, while moving production to the U.S. from Mexico will help it save logistics costs. Ford will foray into the small pickup segment by bringing back the Bronco and Ranger trucks, a smart move as this segment has shot up 62% so far this year. Ford's (NYSE: F ) shares have been under pressure in 2015 as the uncertainty in the Chinese market, which accounts for almost a fifth of its sales, has weighted on the stock. However, investors seem to be missing the bigger picture. In the U.S., which accounted for almost 39% of Ford's wholesale unit volumes last year, the company is on a roll. This is not surprising as Ford is making the most of its impressive growth in auto sales in the U.S., which outperformed remarkably in August. Vehicle buyers in the U.S. almost bucked the concerns expressed by many that August will see a decline in sales due to one less sales day, a delayed Labor Day weekend, and wild fluctuations in the equity markets. Light truck and car sales dropped only 10,000 units (0.63%) from last August's 1.58 million. Analysts were already confident that the seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) will be above the 17 million mark, and may even go up to 17.4 million in August. But the actual SAAR for light vehicles rose to 17.8 million and surpassed all predictions. Driven by financing incentives, low fuel prices, and optimism about the economic recovery, auto sales in the U.S. hit their fastest sales pace in 10 years. One prediction by industry experts that proved right was that Ford will report positive growth for August despite concerns regarding the overall economy. But they had expected the company to report only a fraction of a percentage growth. However, when Ford actually reported its sales results for last month, it became clear that the new F-150 is gaining impressive traction. In fact, Ford reported a 5.4% increase in August sales to 234,237 light vehicles as its trucks and SUVs were in demand. More specifically, the F-Series trucks were the key drivers behind Ford's growth. For the first time this year, the F-Series crossed the 70,000 truck sales mark in a month, translating into a 15% increase in retail sales. Looking ahead, it is highly likely that Ford will be able to sustain this impressive growth momentum in its truck sales, as it is coming up with new strategies to target this fast-growing market. Trucks have been Ford's primary growth drivers in the U.S. The company has sold 1,178,872 light trucks as against 565,341 cars through August this year. Thus, it is natural for Ford to concentrate more on this segment. Earlier this year, Ford was struggling in this segment due to low inventories of the F-150, but things have changed for the better. In fact, Ford expects its pre-tax profit to grow by as much as 51% this year, with the resumption of the full production of the F-150. In ideal circumstances, the F-Series comprises of nearly one-third of Ford's sales in the U.S. Thus, the return of F-150 to its normal inventory and sales levels will now allow Ford to implement its pending plans regarding strengthening its medium-duty and small truck line-up. Last year, Ford announced its plans to replace the existing Cummins 6.7-liter ISB engine in the new versions of the F-160 and F-750 trucks with its own Power Stroke V8 engine, which is designed and built in-house. As a result, Ford will be able to save more costs by sourcing the engine in-house. Moreover, the production of both these new trucks was also meant to be moved from Mexico to the United States. Ford has completed both these transitions recently and rolled out the first American-made F-650 and F-750 models off the line at its Ohio assembly plant in Avon Lake. The company is also offering an option of a gas-powered (a segment first), 6.8-liter V10 engine that produces 320 horsepower and 460 ft-lb torque. In fact, with this transition, Ford has now become the only one to design and build its own diesel engine and transmission mechanism for medium-duty trucks, which will act as an advantage for the company going forward. Trucks and SUVs are in such strong demand in the U.S. that Ford seems compelled to use all its truck building capabilities and target every sub segment of this market. As a result, Ford is planning to make a comeback in the small pickup truck market in the U.S. with a new version of the Ranger. The small pickup truck will most likely be manufactured at a factory in the Detroit suburb of Wayne, Michigan. Ford is also negotiating about making a new small SUV that goes by the name of Bronco. Now, small pickup trucks are not new to the U.S. During the 1990s, small pickups were highly preferred by buyers because of their lower prices, reasonable mileage, and the ability to carry light loads. But, as a result of an improvement in the fuel economy of bigger, more load-capable trucks like the F-150, small pickups in the U.S. went out of vogue. However, in 2015, more than 211,000 units of small pickup trucks have been sold through July this year, up 62% from last year. Hence, this is the reason why Ford is mulling introducing the Bronco and the Ranger in the U.S. once again after halting their production years ago. Ford's outstanding sales in August talk volumes about its strong strategy. Looking ahead, it is likely that Ford will be able to sustain this momentum, as it is targeting the right growth areas of the auto market in the U.S. Thus, I think that Ford's strong performance in August and a strong pipeline going forward will play a key role in helping the stock make a comeback since the U.S. is a key contributor to its sales.
