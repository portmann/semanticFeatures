Ford Investments In China: Good Or Bad News? - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha We believe that the company's investments internationally, especially in places like China, have already begun to provide rewards for the company. For the longest time, we have argued that the investments that Ford (NYSE: F ) is making in international operations overseas in places like Asia and Europe would eventually be a driver for the company's consolidated bottom line. It is been our thesis that investments that the company has already made in places like China, where Ford has spent a significant amount in innovation and marketing tailored specifically to the Chinese population, will add to the company's robust domestic demand and round out a fantastic new Ford. We believe that the company's investments internationally, especially in places like China, have already began to provide rewards for the company. International sales for the company have been a strength, and Ford is widely regarded amongst analysts and contributors on Seeking Alpha as heading in the right direction. Satisfied with the investments the company has already made, especially with recent investments in India, we were actually a bit surprised to see Ford making a new investment in China valued at over $1 billion. The interesting thing about this spending, is not that Ford will be researching simply new and innovative ways to make cost-efficient high margin vehicles, which was their previous research and development strategy in places like India. The interesting thing is that Ford is going to be spending this money to try and actually get ahead of the technology curve in China, focusing on smart cars that you can control from your phone, and where the driver has significant technology at their command through a sophisticated in-dash system. This is not just an investment in trying to create a cost efficient vehicle, this is a real investment in trying to corner the future of the automobile market. Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) said on Monday it will invest 11.4 billion yuan ($1.8 billion) over the next five years to expand research and development in China, the latest effort by the U.S. carmaker to secure a larger slice of the world's biggest auto market. Ford has rapidly gained market share over the past few years at mainly the expense of Japanese rivals, helped by its efforts to incorporate Chinese consumer tastes in its cars sold in the country. The Dearborn, Michigan-based carmaker is the fifth-biggest foreign automaker in China, after General Motors ( GM.N ), Volkswagen ( VOWG_p.DE ), Hyundai Motor Co ( 005380.KS ) and Nissan Motor Co ( 7201.T ). Speaking at a corporate event in Shanghai, Chief Executive Mark Fields also said the company will introduce the C-MAX Energi, a plug-in hybrid, and the Mondeo conventional hybrid to the China market next year. "By 2020 we will offer customers in China a range of hybrid, plug-in hybrid and full electric vehicles," he said. Beijing has been trying to encourage the use of more electric vehicles to combat pollution, but progress has been slow mainly due to the lack of infrastructure. What does this mean for the company? What does this mean for the investment thesis? First, it means that the company continues to be committed to allocating capital toward innovation and growth internationally. We think this method of capital allocation, versus something like General Motors' massive buyback, is still a great forward thinking way to hopefully provide continued long-term Alpha for you shareholders. In that respect, we think it is a good idea. On the other hand on the other hand, this will probably have an impact on the investment case for the short-term, though not for the long-term. The increased level of spending associated with international development means that profitability may take longer then many had expected. If Ford's goal is simply to bolster the top line in places like China, we think that this could be one item that puts a damper on the stock price in the short-term. Our conclusion on Ford has been relatively simple. We don't see the stock price moving back towards, or over $20, until the company can easily beat estimates and produce significant profit growth. At some point, Ford is going to have to turn off some of the spending, and it is when they do that we predict the bottom line and stock price will really start to show significant improvement. Its profitability is put off, it's not the worst thing in the world for those who have a long-term view of the company. Our goal as shareholders is to take a minimum five-year outlook on the future of this company and hold our shares and collect dividends accordingly. Again, while this aggressive spending may make short-term profitability difficult to achieve, we don't mind collecting Ford's 4% yield in the meantime. We remain long.
