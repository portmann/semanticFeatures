Ford's Momentum In Europe Continues Through August - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Europe's auto market continues to expand. It's not worth going over our long drawn out thesis about Ford (NYSE: F ), when we have commented on the company in so many articles that you can view here . We have made no secret of our bull stance on the company. Ford stock continues to be range bound in trading, while the market waits for the bottom line improvements that are going to finally drive the equity higher. Our domestic bull case basically revolves around the company having continued success with its F series and it's Mustang models. So far it looks as if this part of our case is holding up very well, as these models are actually, in the U.S. market, seen as exceeding demand. With the domestic case as a backbone, we are expecting forward global profitability to be the "X factor" that can push the company's stock and bottom line higher. Ford has made numerous investments in major markets like India, Europe and China that it is waiting on to bear fruit. In order for this to occur, not only does demand need to continue to be robust in these geographic regions, but macroeconomic auto data, such as vehicle registration and these economies as a whole, needs to hold up. Data like registrations in these regions needs to continue to grow. And that is exactly what we see with this month's European auto registration tallies. You can see from the chart below that new passenger car registrations in the EU exceeded last year's numbers, yet again. Ford specifically also continued to see growth , Overall EU registrations +11.5% Y/Y to 781,583 units in August led by strong demand in France, the UK, Spain, and Italy. Though it may not be an immensely material development, this news continues to reiterate to us that the economic landscape across the globe remains favorable towards companies like Ford who are trying to expand and are reliant on these international markets as places of growth. As a continued reminder, the company is also coming off of fantastic August auto sales numbers. For August, the company saw strength in its SUVs, Mustang sales, Lincoln sales, and F-series. The product line domestically continues to be robust and in demand. This follows several articles we've written tracking the strong demand of the F-series and the management's continued bullish commentary that is pointing to stability in sales in key areas like China as well as continued growth in the US, which makes up the backbone of Ford's revenue. Ford stock remains very cheap we believe if you have a long-term outlook on the company. We continue to be bullish and we continue to reinvest are dividends as we hold shares.
