Ford: What To Look For In The Q3 2015 Report - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford is expected to report Q3 2015 earnings on October 27. EPS is expected to nearly double on a year-over-year basis. Through the first half of October, Ford (NYSE: F ) shares have bounced back and now sit above the $15 level once again. Despite this, shares of the automaker are still down about 1% year to date as investors have remained skeptical over Ford's earnings power and future prospects. On October 27 Ford will become the second of the Detroit Three to report Q3 2015 earnings, and investors will be examining the quarter's results alongside management's comments. Of the 18 analysts reporting to Yahoo Finance, the average estimate for Ford's Q3 sits at $0.47 in EPS with a high end of $0.54 and a low end of $0.41. If the automaker hits this mark it will provide a near 100% increase over Q3 2014's EPS of $0.24. Surprisingly, despite the volatility in auto stocks over the past few months, Ford's Q3 EPS estimate has mostly stayed in the $0.47 to $0.48 range for the past 90 days. On the top line analysts are calling for $35.20 billion in revenue with a high end of $37.64 billion and a low end of $33.09 billion. With Q3 2014 posting $32.80 billion in revenue, hitting the analyst average would represent a 7.8% year-over-year gain and even hitting the low end would still post a gain. This is a sharp contrast to General Motors (NYSE: GM ) which is expected to post a year-over-year revenue decline although GM is also expected to see a strong EPS gain. Market participants tend to be forward-looking, so the most important parts of Ford's Q3 2015 report may actually come in management's comments and guidance. Weakness in China and Latin America has pressured shares of major automakers and, while Ford has less China exposure than rival GM, investors will be eager to hear management's outlook and plans for this region. Additionally, investors will be looking for Ford's comments regarding returning Europe to profit. The region has been a drain on overall profitability for the past several years but Jim Farley, head of Ford Europe, gave a bullish interview on the region in October after nearly breaking even in Q2 2015. Investors may also get more information from management regarding performance, production, and expectations regarding the new aluminum body F-150. The move to aluminum for Ford's highly popular truck was seen as a major risk but demand has appeared strong so far this year. Management may also add comments regarding the new form of aluminum Alcoa (NYSE: AA ) is developing for the 2016 model that's supposed to be easier to form and more durable. While on the subject of aluminum, management may also give hints regarding expansion of the material into additional pieces of the Ford product line. In addition to the valuation, many investors find Ford shares attractive because of their dividend currently yielding just over 4.0%. While I expect the automaker to raise its dividend in the future as profits continue to grow, a dividend boost appears unlikely to accompany the Q3 2015 report. Based on Ford's pattern of annual dividend raises, the next yet-to-be declared dividend will likely be higher; however, Ford typically makes such an announcement at the beginning of the year rather than alongside Q3 earnings. While I believe a modest share buyback could benefit Ford shareholders, I do not expect one to accompany the Q3 2015 report. This is because Ford has shied away from buybacks in recent years and the voting control of the Ford family effectively prevents activist investors from successfully pushing for such measures. Ford, like GM, is expected to report sharply higher year-over-year EPS but is expected to see revenue growth in contrast to a revenue decline forecast for GM. Investors will also closely monitor management's comments for regional strength as well as product line updates. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
