My 2 Top Stock Picks For 2016 | Seeking Alpha 2016 could be a strong year for traditional bank and manufacturing stocks. Interest rate and consumer spending tailwinds support investments in cyclical stocks. I discuss my two top stock picks for 2016. As the year draws to a close, investors are looking back at a volatile year for stocks. Investors had to deal with a lot of adversity in 2015 with threats erupting in every corner of the world, threatening the prospects of stocks: Greece may no longer be worth a headline, but the country's looming exit from the Eurozone in the summer of 2015 had investors sitting on the edges of their seats. But Greece was not the only concern for stock market investors in 2015. China's economic slowdown and stock market collapse sent shock waves around the globe that hurt European and American stocks just as much as Chinese stocks. Add to the mix an escalating U.S. military campaign in the Middle East, the looming end of the Fed's ZIRP, a crashing crude oil price and slumping high-yield bond prices, and 2015 stands out as another year in which income investors were dealt a lot of curve balls. But there are reasons to be optimistic for 2016... The Fed cleared the path for more interest rate hikes down the line in December when it decided to increase it key benchmark interest rate to a range of 0.25-0.50%. Since normalcy has returned to the capital markets, financials are likely going to be more in demand in 2016 than they were in 2015 simply because higher interest rates support banks' net interest income earnings. And that's a good story to have for next year. Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ) in particular is in a good position to capitalize on higher interest rates, which are projected to add substantially to the bank's bottom line. Bank of America's stock hasn't exactly been a winner in 2015, it is down ~6% year-to-date, but 2016 could be shaping up to be much different for the bank. With NII tailwinds boosting earnings, Bank of America might feel more confident and aggressive in returning cash to shareholders. A new buyback or a dividend hike are also on the horizon for shareholders in 2016. U.S. auto makers reported the best sales in a decade in 2015, fueled by strong pickup and SUV demand, and a bunch of product makeovers. Average vehicle prices were also ticking up, and Ford Motor's (NYSE: F ) new F-150 was flying off the lots, which is setting the stage for a strong 2016. 2015 was a major disappointment for Ford investors, though. As a matter of fact, I was so turned off by investors' lack of interest for this strongly performing auto company that I lowered my return expectations on Ford's stock . In early November I lowered my 12-month price target from $18 to $17. Since Ford can now be bought for $13.80 this price target still implies ~23% upside (+dividend yield)...that's not too bad, is it? That's a good question. I certainly hope that Ford's successes globally catch on with investors. If U.S. consumers continue to spend their money on SUVs and pickups, auto manufacturers are in a good position to grow earnings, and may even be on track for yet another year of record sales. Importantly, in 2015 Ford Motor completed its production ramp-up for the F-150 in both factories that produce the new aluminum-bodied truck: Dearborn, Michigan and Kansas City, Missouri. Henceforth, 2016 will be the first year in which Ford Motor can start selling the F-150 without any significant production restrictions, and it bodes well for sales. Bank of America is at the top of my expectation list: The bank is cheap and has potential for significant earnings growth, which in turn could lead to a new cycle of analyst upgrades in 2016 as NII visibility slowly, but gradually improves. I have restructured my Ford investment, selling January 2017 warrants with a strike price of $17 and moving back into the stock for yield. Ford's stock is down ~11% YTD, but it yields ~4.4% making it a promising play for both income and capital appreciation. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
