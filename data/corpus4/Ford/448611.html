Ford Trucks June Sales Blowout - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford Motor June sales rose 6.4% versus a forecast for a 6.2% increase. We've been sounding the BUY alarm on Ford all week with one article suggesting buying on the Brexit pullback and another commemorating the company"s 1 millionth Eco-Boost F-Series sold. "Strong customer demand has helped us continue growing our truck leadership position, further widening the gap with our nearest competitor versus last year. Consumer demand for Ford SUVs also continues to surge to all-time highs, allowing us to introduce new levels of capability, versatility and technology to a whole new generation of SUV fans." We spent the last two weeks writing two separate articles about why Ford (NYSE: F ) should be bought on the Brexit panic and also commemorating the company with its success stemming from its innovation that it began after the 2008 recession. We wrote two articles over the last two weeks talking about why we are long Ford with a multiyear outlook on the company. We acknowledged that there are some worries in the automobile credit markets and that there is a legitimate concern that the automobile industry may be getting ready to have a bit of a financing bubble burst. None of this, as we pointed out last week, changes the fact that the average age of a vehicle on the road is now almost 12 years old, and all-time high. None of this also addresses the fact that Ford has been able to continue operating with fantastic results, without assistance. Specifically, we said in our last article, Ford is the one company that survived the 2008 crash without assistance, and we think a small burst in the automobile financial market would not phase the company for long. Ford is larger and more diversified globally and economically now as it has ever been. This morning, we got the news that Ford sales in June exceeded expectations led by strong performance in high-margin trucks and SUVs. The company has been forecasting high margin vehicles leading the way for them since November of 2015. Here are some of the key statements that stood out at us from the November 2015 call: •Taking a look at trucks. We sold over 65,000 F-Series, that's a strong number for November. At that number, F-Series retail sales were up 16% and it was our best November ever for F-150, specifically. Those numbers boosted overall F-Series volume to a 10% increase for the month. •This comes against a backdrop of average transaction pricing that was $400 higher than October, so sequentially month-to-month up $400 and $2,700 higher than a year ago, with overall F-Series transaction pricing totaling $42,800 for trucks. So we remain very pleased with the strength of our F-Series business as we close out this year and head into 2016. We have been pointing out that this segment of the company's business has been, and will continue to be, a driver for Ford moving forward. Granted, Ford had a bad sales month in May of this year. However, we know that one month does not make a pattern and we stated the following: For us, however, we just don't think that running away due to some poor May sales metrics right off the bat, without a pattern, is a prudent capital management strategy for a company that has proven that you can exceed expectations and can be friendly to shareholders. We don't think it's time to panic in the case of Ford, and we'll continue to hold our shares long while hedging appropriately. And here we are today with great results from Ford while other automakers like Toyota have had a poor month. We pointed out in one of our past articles that one item Ford bears can't contend with is the company's ability to continue to post strong numbers. The company has posted the following EPS and revenue numbers over the last 13 quarters, Applying a conservative 10x multiple to the average of the 4 years and an annualized 2016 number based on Q1 would give you a target stock price of $18.80, which is about 50% upside from here. Just applying a 10x multiple to Q1's annualized results would give you a stock price just above $24. This potential multiple expansion and the dividend is what keeps us invested in Ford. Is clear that, operationally, Ford continues to fire on all cylinders. The market does not want to assign a serious multiple to the stock because of its worries about the auto financing bubble. Our suggestion was to go long Ford, taking advantage of the company's nearly 5% yield and short CACC or another company with credit exposure to the automobile credit markets. For people with a long-term view on Ford, this might be your best way to collect the yield while insuring yourself. One thing is for sure, month after month Ford numbers continue to impress. We continue to stay long and will continue to reinvest dividends with a focus on the company's fundamental financial operations and a long time horizon.
