Ford: No Dividend Raise, But Special Dividend Issued - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. After the bell on Tuesday, we received some very interesting news from global auto giant Ford (NYSE: F ). The company issued a press release detailing some financial guidance as well as news regarding the dividend. Interestingly, the board of directors decided not to raise the dividend, but give investors a special dividend. Back in December, I detailed the potential for a dividend raise this year, and I thought a 1.5 to 2.5 cent increase was in order. As we approached the timing of this news (usually the first full week of January), I got a little cautious as Ford's December sales were a bit light. Also, more China uneasiness and global market declines had investors on edge, which I thought might prompt a more conservative raise from the company. In the end, the dividend was not raised, so the updated payout chart looks like this. I'm sure there will be investors that are disappointed in the lack of a dividend raise. However, with the cyclical business that Ford runs, the board does have to be cautious at times. You wouldn't want a scenario where the dividend is raised this year, but it has to be cut next year if the auto industry weakens again. Additionally, as you will see in the chart below, Ford shares are near their lowest point over the last two years. At Tuesday's close, not including the share decline in the after-hours session, the annual yield was up to 4.67%. The dividend yield is in fact higher than it was in previous months, even though investors are not getting a higher payout. Those buying the stock now will appreciate that fact more than those already in the name. Ford shares currently offer a lot more income potential than US fixed income instruments, as a 30-Year Treasury isn't even fetching 3.00% currently. The interesting part of Tuesday's news was that the company declared a special $1 billion payout, or $0.25 per share. This is equivalent to almost 42% of the current annual payout, and represents 1.95% of Tuesday's closing price. I'm sure there are those that would have rather seen this money used to repurchase shares. The special dividend will be taxed for investors, whereas a buyback would not be. A buyback reduces the share count, helps earnings per share, adds a buyer to the market, and provides a cash flow savings on dividend payouts. With Ford shares coming down, a buyback might have done more for the stock than a special dividend. As for the business, management stated that it expects a record pre-tax profit for 2015, excluding special items, to be at the upper half of guidance for $10 billion to $11 billion. This year's forecast calls for flat to higher pre-tax profits, again excluding special items. 2015 has consistently been described as a "breakthrough" year, and management is hoping that this year will be even better. In the end, I believe investors will be mixed regarding the news out of Ford. While the special dividend is a nice one-time payout, I'm sure there will be disappointment among those looking for a raise. Given the stock's recent decline, the yield is fast approaching 5.00%, so I'm sure the board took that into consideration. As long as the auto business remains strong, which Ford believes will continue this year, this name will continue to be a strong investment for those looking for solid income.
