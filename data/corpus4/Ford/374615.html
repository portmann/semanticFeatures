Kia Attacks Ford's Golden SUV Child; Will It Impact Ford's Bottom Line? - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford is unusual in that its mainstream SUV outsells its mainstream sedan, unlike companies such as Honda, Nissan and Toyota. With Ford’s unusual dependence on the Escape SUV comes exposure to new competent competition. Being part of the world’s fifth-largest automaker, Kia has sold unusually few Sportage SUVs in the past, in relation to its mainstream sedan, the Optima. To change this in a major product offensive against Ford, Kia is now launching an all-new Germany-designed Sportage, which looks like Porsche Macan. If Kia can move its SUV-to-sedan ratio from 1:3 to 1:1 or better, like Ford, it stands to add 100,000 annual sales in US alone, threatening the Ford Escape. When we think about Ford's (NYSE: F ) sales success in the US market, the F-series trucks come to mind. At 780,354 in 2015, the F-series constituted 30% of the company's unit sales. That 30% F-series dependency is legitimately impressive, of course, but also begs the question: What about the other 70% of Ford's sales? Given that the F series is what most people consider to be a "large truck" - that other 70% is mostly "cars" (of which crossovers and SUVs are a part). In 2015, the Ford Escape became Ford's best-selling non-F series passenger vehicle, outselling all other Ford sedans, hatchbacks, SUVs and crossovers. If you include the Lincoln sister model, the MKC, this phenomenon becomes even more accentuated - and the Lincoln MKC grew an astounding 88% in the US in 2015. The fact that a crossover-SUV outsells sedans and equivalent models, is somewhat unique to Ford. Whether at Toyota (NYSE: TM ) or Nissan ( OTCPK:NSANY ), sedans such as Camry and Altima outsold their SUV counterparts (RAV4 and Rogue) in 2015. In other words, Ford is indeed in an unusual position: It has become dependent on this one particular crossover-SUV model, more so than its competitors who still sell more of their equivalent sedans instead. On the one hand, that's a blessing and a reflection of how superior the Ford Escape model has become in the last year. Anyone who has driven the 2016 model year Ford Escape will testify to its superior driving dynamics, including steering and handling. Auto critic Steve Hammes put it the best in this video review . On the other hand, the success of the Escape is also making Ford more sensitive to new and improved small-to-midsize SUV competition. As I just found out, the greatest threat to Ford's success story comes from Kia ( OTC:KIMTF ), the company closely linked to Hyundai ( OTC:HYMLF , OTC:HYMTF ). In 2010, Kia launched a 2011 model year Kia Sportage model, which was praised for its exterior design, but was not otherwise really competitive with what Ford has been offering in its outstanding Escape most recently. In 2015, Kia sold "only" 53,739 units of the Sportage in the US - approximately one-sixth as many as Ford Escape and Lincoln MKC combined. But this is about to change. An all-new Kia Sportage will start to arrive in dealerships this month, March 2016. Consider this: While the Ford Escape outsold all other Ford sedans and equivalent, in the US, in 2015 - including its direct sedan counterpart the Fusion - the Kia Sportage didn't come close to equaling its sedan counterpart, the Optima. US sales of the Sportage were only one-third of the Optima, in 2015. This means that if Kia manages to mimic Ford's success with the Escape, it stands to triple sales of the Sportage SUV. This increase might come from Kia's own Optima sedan - but logically it could also come from the relative crossover-SUV sales leader, the Ford Escape. (Yes, I know, the Honda (NYSE: HMC ) CR-V and Toyota RAV4 slightly best the Ford Escape in absolute sales numbers, but notice the word "relative" - as in "relative" to their sedan-equivalent sales) To find out, I took the all-new 2017 Kia Sportage out for some spirited driving over the mountains and into the deserts of the American West. As it turns out, this all-new 2017 Kia Sportage was nothing like its 2011-2016 predecessor. Nothing at all. For starters, it looks a lot different. The front of the car now looks a lot like the Porsche Macan, which is a much more expensive car, starting at $55,450. The Kia sells for "only" $34,895 fully loaded. When I tried to equip the Porsche to a similar level, I ended up at $66,685, although I'm sure it's not possible to line it up perfectly to the millimeter against the Kia. In addition, of course, the Porsche has a more powerful engine - 340 horsepower instead of 240 - and naturally it offers faster acceleration. Still, this Kia Sportage is a major step up in looks and sophistication in a way you would never have thought of a Kia product in the past. The seats and seating position were perfect. Right after the Kia Sportage, I jumped into an Audi Q7 for a few days, and that's obviously a much larger SUV but with a price similar to the Porsche Macan. Guess what? The Kia seats and seating position were better than in the much more expensive and larger Audi Q7 SUV. Similar to the other most recent Kia models, the instrumentation is also supremely easy to use. The infotainment system is a simple touchscreen - no overload of buttons, knobs and interface concepts to remotely navigate the screen. That 240 horsepower engine (two liter four cylinder) is good, but I didn't think it was any better than the one in the Ford Escape - and it doesn't match the best from VW/Audi, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover. It also drinks gasoline. The fully loaded version that I drove is rated at 20 MPG city, 23 MPG highway. In comparison, you can get much larger SUVs that consume equal amounts - or slightly less - of gasoline: Volvo XC90: 22 MPG city, 25 MPG highway Mazda XC-9 launches soon with 21 MPG city, 27 MPG highway And the Ford Escape achieves 21 MPG city, 28 MPG highway, in its equivalent fully loaded AWD trim with the 2 liter turbo. That said, that was also the only flaw I found with the 2017 Kia Sportage. In every other measure, it matches the class-leading Ford Escape. It even offers Android Auto (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Apple CarPlay (NASDAQ: AAPL ) right now - whereas those capabilities arrive on the Ford Escape only later in calendar year 2016. With a very diversified vehicle portfolio, as with some other large automakers, the Ford portfolio includes both laggards and outperformers. In recent years, the Escape small SUV has been one of Ford's success stories. It's made it more dependent on this SUV than any of its major competitors, who still have sedans as their best-sellers. It is therefore critical for Ford to not lose its grip on this "golden child" in its SUV portfolio. There will be other vehicles in Ford's portfolio that underperform. In this context, this unprecedented offensive by the world's fourth-largest automaker - seeing as Hyundai-Kia was 19% larger than Ford in 2015 poses an exceptionally well-targeted attack on Ford's "golden child." If Kia can follow Ford's relative SUV-sedan pattern, it would add 100,000 units per year for the Sportage, part of which it stands to take away from Ford as described above. This "small but not the smallest" SUV segment has become the industry's fastest-growing, and it already has many excellent competitors. I view Ford and Kia to now have the two best products in the field, with many others right behind, including Mazda, Hyundai and the segment's best-sellers from Honda, Toyota and Nissan. If you go check out the all-new 2017 Kia Sportage, you will see why it has a chance to narrow the gap with the segment's best-sellers, in terms of the sales column. It's a design like none other - and with an interior to match. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).
