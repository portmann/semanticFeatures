New U.S. Ford Plant Is A Win For PR, The Country, And Ford Investors - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha A large part of the Ford bull case is continued domestic success. Ford has been criticized of late for outsourcing work to Mexico. Ford solves the problem of increased demand and the PR issue of creating jobs by investing $1.3 billion in a new U.S. plant in Kentucky. While following the Ford (NYSE: F ) story for the better part of the last year, we have constantly laid out what our long-term thesis is for being bullish on the company. This thesis consists of a strong backbone of domestic results, spearheaded by the F-150 and the new Mustang, as well as coming profitability as a result of investments internationally. Ford investors have watched the stock remain in a trading range for years now, with the dividend the only constant each quarter. The key for the stock price moving up is going to be what type of return the company gets on its investments overseas. Since the recession, the company has spent significant sums of money investing in property plant and equipment in places like Europe and Asia. Just as soon as several months ago, Ford said that it was essentially doubling down on its investment in China and continuing to allocate capital towards innovating a leading smart car in the extremely populous region. We have said in numerous past articles that we believe once Ford can show some operating leverage with its international operations, in China and in other markets like South America, that the company's bottom line will finally show a positive effect and the stock price will begin to move up out of the trading range that it has been in for over a year. Just as important as its expansion, is the company's ability to keep domestic demand fulfilled and maintain strong sales in the United States. In order to do this, they need to effectively manage moving the levers of incentive selling and need to maintain positive public perception in the country. This brings us to our news, which is that Ford is investing $1.3 billion into a brand-new Kentucky based plant to help take its F-250 and F-350 series and move them to aluminum models, similar to the move the company has made with the F-150. Here's a small excerpt from this press release , We believe this is going to have a positive impact on Ford for several reasons. The first reason is that Ford has been receiving an enormous amount of criticism from a certain presidential candidate who has been critical of them moving jobs overseas and into Mexico. We understand that it is important for Ford to maintain its "made in America" image for many of its consumers, who seek to purchase American products. Making such a sizable investment in the United States, and a plant that is supposed to employ over 2000, shows that Ford is serious about its commitment to the United States. We believe this move and this headline will also help out Ford significantly from a public relations perspective. Obviously, this is also going to help Ford out in the sense that it is going to make sure that there are vehicles to meet demand of its new products. The hope is that the F-250 and F-350 will sell as well as the F-150 did, a model that continues to have significant demand and continues to impress from a sales perspective. Aluminum has been one of the most hardest hit commodities over the last few months, as all commodities have dropped into a bit of their own recession. Aluminum pricing is near multi-year lows, as you can see from the above chart. This is a great time to get this initiative off the ground for the company. While, again, we understand that Ford stock may not break out of its current trading range until the company can put all of the pieces together and show significant profit overseas, we are happy with the way that Ford is spending it's capital by investing in itself. We continue to be bullish on the automaker and think collecting the near 4% dividend yield while waiting for the company to execute its long-term strategy remains an attractive place to allocate capital.
