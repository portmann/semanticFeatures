AAPL Tumbles After Report Of 70-80% Plunge In iPhone Chip Shipments | Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! The popular belief is that gold is a good hedge against inflation. Owning gold will protect you from rising prices. Is that true? The 24 Banks now have a summary NET short position that is more extreme than ever. Will The Banks lose this time? Or will The Banks simply be successful again in rigging prices lower so that...

Apple share are tumbling (as are the entire complex of suppliers) following a report from Nikkei that Taiwan Seminconductor's shipments of iPhone 6s, iPhone 7 chips for June-Dec. period will likely shrink 70%-80% vs year earlier. As one anayst noted, a decline of more than 20-30% is not in consensus estimates. As Bloomberg reports, of particular interest is that this cut to orders is about upcoming iPhone 7, not about the well-publicized iPhone 6 slowdown. The timing would be right about now for early wafer starts for silicon for September launch of iPhone 7... and it seems market participants agree... However, as Bloomberg reports, for investors contemplating prospects for the smartphone market after a shaky earnings report from Apple, Asian suppliers just provided a few hints: It’s going to get worse before it gets better. Three suppliers that seldom command much attention, working behind the scenes to make devices sold under the brands of better-known customers, put out back-to-back earnings reports Tuesday. They spell trouble ahead for smartphone makers and other companies that once thrived on mobile mania. Pegatron Corp., which assembles iPhones, missed profit expectations and said April sales dived 16 percent. Minebea Co., which makes LED lights for mobiles, lagged its own forecasts for revenue and earnings. Japan Display Inc., which supplies screens to Apple and others, said profit has deteriorated so rapidly it will lose money for the fiscal year and suspend a promised dividend. Adding to the gloom, Lenovo Group Ltd. tumbled to a four-year low as analysts warned of rising competition. Asian components makers are positioned early in the supply chain so they often signal what’s ahead for giants like Apple, Samsung Electronics Co. and Xiaomi Corp. The iPhone maker offered evidence of a deteriorating market with its first quarterly sales decline in 13 years. Now, some are bracing for a possible triple-whammy: sliding sales, an unfettered market-share competition and crumbling prices. "The smartphone industry will continue to slow down this year,” said Richard Ko, a Taipei-based analyst at KGI Securities Co. “Competition will worsen and prices will likely continue to fall."

It looks like people are starting to go back to dumbphones, so I guess I'm finally cool....... Dumped it for the Galaxy s7. My god what a far superior product! Steve Jobs is dead and apple will sadly soon follow. Innovation had been non existent since his passing.  Shades of Blackberry.. Thu, 05/12/2016 - 11:53 | 7547847 rpboxster I gave my iphone6 to my kid, and got a Nexus 5x.  I don't miss a thing, even though I've been an iphone user since the first gen.  Once fingerprint unlock came to 5X and 6P, I made the switch.  Truly can't justify the Apple/Samsung high end price tags in view of these Nexus offerings--marginal performance differences at half the price, unlocked.

Thu, 05/12/2016 - 10:27 | 7547321 j0nx You've hit the main reason right here although my monthly bill was always the same regardless if I was subsidizing the phone or not. I never minded subsidizing my phone with att because I am never leaving them anyway so being locked into a 2 year contract was something I didn't care about. Then they went to this 0% interest loan over 2 years where you pay $30 a month extra for the phone until it's paid off when you never had to do that before and all this legalese mumbo jumbo about what happens to the phone if you leave before it's paid off etc just confused people, myself included. It is now cheaper in the long run to buy the phone outright and most people don't have $600-800 to pay for one of these things hence the drastic decline in sales. Thu, 05/12/2016 - 11:57 | 7547871 rpboxster Which is why I got a 32G Nexus 5x for $320.  90% of the performance for 40% of the price.  Great phone.  I don't miss my iphone at all--and I was a longtime user of the apple ecosystem.

Thu, 05/12/2016 - 10:37 | 7547354 j0nx Past 3 years at every Apple event when all my coworkers are huddled around the projector with the Apple conference on the big screen I always pop out to say, "let me guess, bigger screen, faster processor, more memory" and they just wave me away. ZERO innovation going on there for at least 3 years now. I still prefer their phones over Android which I currently use now but Android has a lot going for it over Apple. Android needs to develop some kind of integrated easy to use imessage, txt message and phone sharing capability with their tablets like Apple does and then it will be no contest. Those are the features I miss most from my old iphone. Cook is more interested in how he looks in his skinny jeans than in making sure his company is leading the pack in innovation. The board should have ousted him a year ago imo.

Why in the world should I spring for a new phone and new contract when I can simply replace the aging battery for $50? IMO, Apple screwed the pooch when they went all in on the iPhone, disregarding all the other cool products that paved the way. Thu, 05/12/2016 - 10:35 | 7547358 RockySpears I got a Samsung SIII mini, inherited it from No. 1 son 2 years ago when his 2 yr contract finished.  Battery is original, and a new one is Â£5 and I fit it myself. Thu, 05/12/2016 - 10:24 | 7547297 Lorca's Novena An 80% decline in chips for the iPhone 7 coming out next year is an 80% decline in sales. This Pos stawk should retrace back to realistic levels, unless the FBI's and CIA's of the world will prop it up like the fakebook scam. Does aapl even make computers anymore other than their laptop? Apple originally had three co-founders. The third co-founder, a man  named Ronald Wayne, joined Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak but he left the  company only 12 days after it was founded. He sold his 10% share for  only $800 and got an additional payout of $1,500. Had Wayne stayed with  the company, his shares would be worth around $60 billion today!

I watch others sit around playing games, going on the internet and yapping to someone all day long. I now have two laptops, a IPad and this IPhone. Spend two-three hours a week updating the useless things. Miss one update and it's a thousand emails from the IT gestapo's. I have actually had to leave customers OOS updating them.  Then you get phone calls from people you never heard of. It's amazing how some idiot sitting in a cubical can talk about nothing for twenty minutes. The millennials are really good at it.  Thu, 05/12/2016 - 10:42 | 7547400 Strode2 Thu, 05/12/2016 - 10:52 | 7547455 south40_dreams Facebook is the one that scares me.
