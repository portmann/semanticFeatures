We have stopped paying the State and we have enough money to at least survive. Overdue payments to the Tax Authorities and to Social Security are about 98 Billion Euros (56% of GDP) and growing by a little more than 1 Billion per month.

Netflix making their own shows, I thought they were the moder replacement for Block Buster. .gov takes money collected from taxpayers and 'invests' in the likes of Apple and others who use foreign slave labor corporations to build their shit. Wed, 01/20/2016 - 10:15 | 7071617 Allen_H I really liked the Dare Devil Netflix done, but I torrented it. Other than that I know nothing about them, except they charge for viewing. I only use the brainwash box when trying to improve my language skills, I do not have English telLIEvision here.
