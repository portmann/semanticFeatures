Best Bet In Domestic Automotive Stocks: Ford - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford’s sales increased 2% in June 2015. The big seller was Ford’s F-150 pickup truck, which has an aluminum frame. Other Ford models – Edge, Explorer and Fusion – are selling like hotcakes. In his recent, perspicacious article - What Alcoa Told Us About Beer, Cars and Planes - Nick Rokke explained that growing purchases of raw materials, especially aluminum, seem to indicate that America's economy is doing okay. And the Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F ) is doing better than just okay. Ford's sales increased 2% in June 2015, while GM's dropped 3%, compared to June a year ago. If that trend continues, Ford's overall sales could improve by 17% over last year. The prize in Ford's stable is the F-150 with its aluminum frame. Some analysts believe Ford could sell 700,000 trucks in 2015. Since nothing succeeds like success, it's a sure bet that other truck manufacturers will follow Ford's lead. Expect a slew of aluminum framed trucks in the near future. GM has been hindered by a lack of innovation. The changes to its truck line-up are cosmetic, along with a higher MSRP. Consumers don't perceive much benefit in paying more for last year's model in a new package. But industry experts expect GM will begin incorporating more aluminum into its trucks , which could happen by 2018 or 2019. That might be too little too late, especially if Ford takes advantage of the lull to establish its dominance. GM's latest version of the Volt will be available in the second half of 2015, but consumer attraction to hybrids is drooping. Case in point: the Cadillac ELR, which is destined for extinction. The average price of a 2015 Ford pickup was $44,000, an increase of $3,600 over the previous year. And the average increase of Ford's other models was up $2,700, compared to June of 2014. And sales of Ford's new Mustang have increased 54% year to date. Fiat Chrysler also reported increased sales, up 8% over the year. But that number is a little misleading. Sales of the Chrysler and Jeep brands were up, while sales of Dodge declined 14% and sales of the Fiat brand dropped a dismal 30%. And Ram truck sales increased just slightly, 2% over the year. Chrysler's big seller was the Chrysler 200, which seems to be carrying the brand at the present juncture. Expect the Ram brand of trucks to be one of the first to incorporate aluminum frames into their new models, a la Ford. The big problem at Fiat Chrysler is recalls. In fact, the company is presently negotiating with the NHTSA over a $700 million fine. To ensure that sales remain strong, Ford plans to continue to add innovations to its trucks, along with all its other models. Future innovations include : EcoBoost engine technology that not only increases mpg, but sustains the 'fun' factor; increased utilization of carbon-fiber composites that reduce weight, while improving fuel economy. Ford will be the first to introduce carbon fiber wheels. And Ford is expanding its use of aluminum: for example, the new Raptor will lose 500 pounds of flab due to the use of aluminum components. Less weight translates to better behavior in off-road conditions. Ford has developed a new 10-speed automatic transmission. The result: more power and improved fuel economy. When contacted for comment, Ariel Avinari of Global Auto Sports said that he expects domestic auto sales to continue performing strongly through 2017. He cites three primary reasons for this expectation: "the relative stability of gas prices; low interest rates and the fact that most Americans' cars are 11.5 years old." Some experts predict that interest rates will rise in September, if the Fed does what some analysts believe. If interest rates do rise, Avinari anticipates most automotive manufacturers will counterbalance any increase with incentive programs designed to sustain the present sales rate. Incentive programs depend on rebates, subsidized leases and discounted loan rates. Signals indicate that Ford should remain in the cat-bird seat for the next few years, which means investors should seriously take into consideration the following: Ford's free cash flow is head-over-heels better than Fiat Chrysler and GM. Remember the Tom Hanks movie The Money Pit? Well, GM appears to be dumping money into a giant hole. Moreover, some analysts are predicting that Ford will grow 22 percent in the next half-decade. Even the Bears predict at least a 15 percent increase. And if oil prices remain low, which is the forecast, consumers will be lining up for Ford Explorers. That means Ford is a good bet. Investors should note that on Wednesday S&P Research issued a "strong buy" position on Ford, with a target of $19. As long as oil prices don't spike and stay up, that target seems reasonable.
