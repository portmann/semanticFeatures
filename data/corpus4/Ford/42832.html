Why Buy General Motors When There's Ford? - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Lately, General Motors has had a lot of fans in the stock market, including in the hedge fund world from people like David Einhorn. Although the business has done better on the top and bottom lines than Ford, investors should take a close look at the latter before discarding it. Given the disparity in price between the two, it appears as though Mr. Market isn't fully recognizing Ford's potential as a long-term holding. When it comes to cars, customers tend to be fairly picky. The same likely holds true to the shares of car manufacturers like Ford (NYSE: F ) and General Motors (NYSE: GM ). Lately, Mr. Market seems to have a similar sense of loyalty, as evidenced by the fact that shares of the latter have risen more from their 52-week low than Ford's and that they are trading nearer to their 52-week high. While this could be quite bullish for General Motors, investors should take a step back and consider that, just perhaps, Ford may offer the better prospects moving forward. The reason why Mr. Market tends to favor General Motors at this point in time comes down to performance. Over the past five years , the company has outgrown Ford, with sales climbing 15% from $135.59 billion to $155.93 billion while Ford's top line has grown slightly less at 12.5%. Looking at cash flows from operating activities, we see a similar trend, with Ford's metric rising by 26% from $11.48 billion to $14.51 billion while General Motors fared far better, with cash flows from operations soaring 48% from $4.78 billion to $10.06 billion. Even in terms of net income, General Motors has come out on top. Between 2010 and 2014, the company saw its net income actually decline a whopping 40% from $4.67 billion to just $2.80 billion, largely due to an increase in depreciation and amortization during this five-year period. Ford, however, did even worse, with its net income plummeting 51% from $6.48 billion to $3.19 billion. F Net Income (Annual) data by YCharts Based on the numbers alone, investors would be crazy to pick Ford over General Motors but, thankfully for the former's shareholders, it's important to consider the price you are paying for said value. Looking at the graph below, you can see that shares of Ford are actually trading far cheaper than its rival when it comes to free cash flow. With a price/free cash flow ratio of 9.14, the company is less than half as expensive as General Motors, which suggests that Mr. Market is undervaluing the company's lackluster (but all-around reasonable) performance from years past. F Price to Free Cash Flow (Annual) data by YCharts Another way to evaluate the picture is through the lens of share price in relation to net income. As we can see in the graph below, the valuation picture is a little less one-sided by using this metric, which removes the possibility of cash flow timing from its results. At the moment, shares of Ford are going for a fairly high, but not necessarily unreasonable, price/earnings ratio of 19.89, which is just slightly lower than the 21.69 times profits that investors can pick up General Motors for. Looking at asset value, we continue to see that shares of Ford are cheaper than its rival. Currently, investors can pick up the business for just 1.58 times the value of its net assets (all assets less liabilities), which is significantly cheaper than the 2.54 times book value that General Motors are trading for. In essence, although Ford is more profitable on a per-share basis than its peer, Mr. Market is trying to say that the assets that create that value are worth about 37% less than the assets that create General Motors' profitability. Right now, Mr. Market seems enamored by General Motors but it appears as though it's more or less disregarding the potential that Ford has. Yes, Ford has underperformed its rival over the past few years but the company's sales and operating cash flows are rising and shares are trading at a rather meaningful discount on a price/book value and a price/free cash flow basis compared to General Motors and at a slight discount when it comes to earnings. Although this does not mean that the company presents investors with phenomenal prospects moving forward, it does imply that it may be a better long-term play for value-oriented investors than General Motors at this point in time.
