Ford: Panic Time? - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha May auto sales were alarming across the board. Ford sold off and many are writing why they are selling the automaker due to May's results. We offer an alternative gameplan instead of crudely dumping shares of what we believe to be a great long term hold. Ford (NYSE: F ) posted terrible May sales , as did the rest of the auto industry. Many people are arguing that the United States auto market is starting to show signs of running out of steam. We have been of the sentiment that the entire US economy is slowing down and that a rising interest-rate environment is going to cause trouble in the high-yield debt markets. We've said this in basically every article we've written over the last year or two. Many people seem to believe that this is going to carry over into the auto sector and nary is there a conversation about the short-term debt cycle or the economy turning over without somebody bringing up their contention that the United States auto market is heading for a downturn. U.S. auto stocks, trading at crazy low earnings multiples, reflect the sentiment that all hell is about to break loose. We have acknowledged this line of thinking, but we haven't really argued against it. We know that the United States auto market is getting frothy, but we also know that the average vehicle age on the street is at all time highs over 11 years. We also are encouraged by Ford's ability to continue to post good operating results throughout the course of the last 12 months. As we have said in several other articles, we have been keeping a close eye on monthly sales, European auto registrations, and other metrics that we can follow in between Ford's actual earnings reports. We have noted in the past that a small aberration in one month of data is not necessarily indicative of longer-term pain for the company. Ford has had sales hiccups before, we think it's important to see where the company goes from here. We would be foolish to say that May's sales do not have us keeping a very close eye on what is going on. That is the truth, we are not just ignoring this bad data. But, we believe there are several prudent strategies to take with Ford going forward and we are going to offer up our take on why Ford may not be a company to just go out and sell because of May's auto sales. First, Ford continues to pay out a attractive dividend. The company's dividend is now approaching 4.6%, and this is the same company that offered a $1 billion capital return to shareholders in the form of a special dividend just months ago. F Dividend Yield (TTM) data by YCharts That is the type of equity we like to hold onto and use to reinvest. The company has also not slacked on investing in itself. Many companies that return capital to shareholders wind up lagging when it comes to research and development for their own business because they are so concerned with returning capital. For Ford this is not the case. Ford has continued to do well in its investment initiatives in many different global geographies, which we continue to believe will be at the cornerstone to the company operating profitably over the course of the long term. We continue to suggest that if you believe the auto credit markets are going to be the problem, that you can go out and short Credit Acceptance (CACC) and be long Ford. CACC "provides automobile dealers financing programs, and related products and services. It advances money to dealers in exchange for the right to service the underlying consumer loans; and buys the consumer loans from the dealers and keeps various amounts collected from the consumers. The company also engages in the business of reinsuring coverage under vehicle service contracts sold to consumers by dealers on vehicles financed by the company." This gives you the benefits of being able to hold Ford and potentially reinvesting dividends while also having a hedge directly on automobile credit. If you are like us, and Ford is one of the companies that you have a multiple year outlook on, you do not mind holding it and collecting the dividends, as long as you're hedging appropriately. If you do not want to hedge by shorting CACC, you can also have a broader market hedge or a high-yield hedge, perhaps by shorting SPY or HYG . For us, however, we just don't think that running away due to some poor May sales metrics right off the bat, without a pattern, is a prudent capital management strategy for a company that has proven that you can exceed expectations and can be friendly to shareholders. We don't think it's time to panic in the case of Ford, and we'll continue to hold our shares long while hedging appropriately. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
