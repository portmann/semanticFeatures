How ConocoPhillips' Eagle Ford Operations Will Survive $56 WTI - ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) | Seeking Alpha ConocoPhillips is doing extremely well in the Eagle Ford given the current pricing environment. Going forward, ConocoPhillips intends to keep maximizing its resource and earnings potential in the Eagle Ford play through several optimization programs. ConocoPhillips' Upper Eagle Ford pilot program has been a success so far, a big win for investors and the company. With a full-cycle F&D cost of $20 per BOE currently, $17 per BOE on a forward basis, ConocoPhillips is fully capable of dealing with $56 WTI. Developing top tier shale plays remains a priority for ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP ) after its big update on April 8, 2015 , even in the face of an uncertain commodity pricing outlook. WTI [West Texas Intermediate, one benchmark for American crude prices] is expected to plummet from an average of $93 a barrel last year to somewhere around $60 a barrel this year. By 2016, WTI is expected to recover and begin climbing back up towards ~$70 a barrel. ConocoPhillips is operating under the assumption that WTI, Brent, and Henry Hub will trade around $70 a barrel, $75 a barrel, and $3.50 per mmBtu in 2017, respectively, which is fairly conservative guidance and points towards ConocoPhillips' realization that it needs to keep costs under control. Recently, WTI has climbed back towards $56 a barrel as of April 15, which is a good sign for energy investors. As you can see in the graphs below, no one is certain where oil or Henry Hub [US natural gas pricing benchmark] will go or how long it will take for prices to recover. Shale plays have a much higher cost of production, with a rough breakeven price of $65 a barrel , than the $27 a barrel breakeven price for onshore fields in the Middle East. However, that number is much lower in the core parts of the most productive shale plays in North America. In order to cope with $50 WTI, ConocoPhillips and the energy industry as a whole have been reducing third party costs [as a result of low oil prices] while boosting the productivity of their wells. In the Eagle Ford, ConocoPhillips has extended the length of its laterals and shortening the space between each frac stage. This means that the horizontal reach of its wells are longer and that there are more locations for oil, NGLs [natural gas liquids], and natural gas to flow into its wells. On top of that, Conoco is using more proppant [a solid material, like sand or ceramic based materials, that is added to fracking fluid to frack wells] during the completion stage to further boost well productivity. Below is a picture that highlights how ConocoPhillips' improved technique has translated into much better results. Being able to bring wells online that yield an EUR [estimated ultimate recovery] rate that is 30% higher than its 2013 design for 30% less [drilling and completion cost wise] 40% faster [spud to production cycle time] is why Conoco isn't worried about low oil prices just yet. The EUR rate is how much oil, NGLs, and natural gas a well will produce over its lifetime, and is a very important metric to watch. Higher 30-day IP rates don't mean much unless the shale operator can prove that it will translate into a higher EUR rate. ConocoPhillips has done just that. Combined, all of Conoco's efficiency gains have turned the Eagle Ford into a very economical shale play. An excerpt from its annual analyst and investor meeting transcript ; "Interestingly with all of the improvement that we've had on cost on the Eagle Ford and we'll show you some detail in a minute and the early part of the cost deflation that we're already experiencing, our full cycle unit F&D cost in the Eagle Ford is now down to about $20 and on a forward basis our unit F&D cost is well below $17 now in the Eagle Ford." Investors should keep in mind that the full-cycle ~$20 per BOE F&D [finding and development] cost is based on the price to produce one barrel of oil equivalent, not just a barrel of oil. Assuming a 60% oil [at $56 a barrel based on WTI], 20% NGLs [at 1/3 WTI], 20% dry gas [$2.60 mmBtu based on Henry Hub] production mix, Conoco would receive an unhedged price of ~$45 per BOE from its Eagle Ford output. The full-cycle ~$20 per BOE F&D cost doesn't include every cost involved, but it does show that Conoco can still make money on its Eagle Ford wells, even if the payback period takes longer than "normal". According to Wood Mackenzie [cited in ConocoPhillips' presentation], Conoco needs WTI to be just over $40 a barrel in order to generate a 10% internal rate of return [IRR] on its Eagle Ford wells. There still remains room for improvement, as Conoco is testing out its "Drilling Execution Efficiency Program", which could further reduce drilling times. Initially, early results pointed towards the "DEEP" pilot project reducing drilling times by 20%. Now that the results are in, management noted that drilling times could be reduced by 30%. The faster Conoco can drill its unconventional wells, the less it costs [generally speaking] and the quicker ConocoPhillips can capitalize on any meaningful increase in WTI in the future. Bringing more productive wells online faster and at a lower cost is just part of Conoco's plan for the Eagle Ford. Another way Conoco is seeking to maximize its Eagle Ford potential is by tapping into both the upper and lower benches of the Eagle Ford to grow its drilling inventory and thus its resource potential. In order to do this, Conoco has been actively testing out downspacing pilot projects in the area. Downspacing refers to reducing the distance between the laterals of wells, allowing for more wells to be brought online in the same amount of space assuming the wells don't communicate with each other [in other words, interfere with each other's production]. Results from ConocoPhillips' Upper Eagle Ford pilot tests point towards wells targeting this interval producing similar results compared to its wells targeting the Lower Eagle Ford horizon. More information is needed to get a better picture of what to expect, but so far it looks like wells targeting either the upper or lower Eagle Ford horizons will be very economical and productive. Below is a picture that highlights just what stacked potential means. The horizon on the top in the picture below, AC, is the Austin Chalk formation which also holds plenty of upside and is currently being evaluated by ConocoPhillips. So far, Conoco has successfully implemented its high/low spacing program in the Lower Eagle Ford horizon, which is a vote of confidence for future spacing and stacked play drilling programs. In 2015, investors should see if Conoco's Lower Eagle Ford downspacing tests work out and should also look out for how well Conoco's triple stack pilot program [targeting both the Upper Eagle Ford and the high/low Lower Eagle Ford] goes. If successful, ConocoPhillips will be able to substantially extend its growth runway in one of the most prolific shale plays in the world. The single biggest problem facing Conoco's Eagle Ford growth ambitions comes down to the price of oil. Production out of the Eagle Ford is heavily weighted towards oil [~60%] and NGLs [~20%, which are primarily valued based on the price of oil], making ConocoPhillips' drilling economics mostly dependent on the price of crude. If Conoco's realized oil price out of the Eagle Ford shale stays around $50 - $60 a barrel for a prolonged period of time, then it will have to keep bringing wells online in the core parts of its Eagle Ford position to withstand the pricing environment. This means that Conoco is forgoing some of its future earnings potential, as these locations would generate very strong returns if WTI returned to $80 a barrel. To counter this, Conoco is doing what it can to expand its high-return drilling inventory. Management sees at least 15 years of drilling locations left in the Eagle Ford if not more, depending on how its pilot programs go. Natural gas prices will play a smaller role, but could offer some upside if the start-up of American LNG exports ends up pushing prices back up to over $3 mmBtu versus $2.60 mmBtu as of April 15. ConocoPhillips plans to boost spending on its Eagle Ford operations as its major projects like the Surmont 2 facility and the APLNG development become operational. This year, Conoco intends to operate an average of seven rigs in the Eagle Ford, which will grow to 12 by 2017. In order to ramp up its drilling activity [in regards to 2015 - 2017], ConocoPhillips will boost its annual Eagle Ford capex budget from ~$1.6 billion this year to ~$2.2 billion in 2017. Conoco's capex plan will boost its Eagle Ford output from ~150,000 BOE/d in 2014 to ~220,000 BOE/d by 2017, equivalent to 13% CAGR [compound annual growth rate] over that period of time. There remains a ton of upside for ConocoPhillips in the Eagle Ford, and this company is well positioned to expand its growth story in the region in the event that WTI begins climbing back towards $70 a barrel. As ConocoPhillips continues to optimize its Eagle Ford operations, it will be able to keep lowering its cost of production. Once ConocoPhillips completes several of its major projects this year that are under construction, it will have the financial flexibility to shift that cash to its unconventional North American operations. The Eagle Ford play remains one of ConocoPhillips' best assets, and stands to reward shareholders with strong liquids-weighted output growth for many years to come.
