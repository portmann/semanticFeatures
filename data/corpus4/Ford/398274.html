What's Happened To Ford, And The Other Auto Stocks? - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Strong underlying performance has not turned into higher stock prices. The trend is industry-wide, not just Ford. The Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F ) just reported "an all time record quarter for the company", with a "very strong performance across the business". A record $3.8 billion pre-tax profit was recorded, up an incredible $2.1 billion in just 12 months. Net income was $2.5 billion, and operating earnings per share were $0.68, "both these results were more than double versus last year". Of course, with such a huge earnings beat on both the top and bottom line, a record 9.8% operating profit margin and the best quarter in Europe for 8 years, the stock rocketed into outer-space, far beyond the Hubble Space Telescope, right? Well, no, not really. Since the earnings release, the stock hasn't moved, nothing has changed from the continued downward slope. The company smashed the ball out of the park and Wall Street didn't bat an eye-lid. This trend has been apparent in most of the auto stocks, with General Motors (NYSE: GM ) being another example of a company that's improving earnings but not appreciating in share price. What we are left with, is a stock like Ford that trades at 6x earnings and yields nearly 4.5%. 6x earnings is a ridiculously cheap valuation for a stock that is growing at the rate that Ford is, especially given the generous dividend yield. GM is even cheaper. Less than 5x earnings and a dividend yield that makes a 10-year bond look like the worthless piece of paper found in a cheap Christmas cracker. Mr Market is not in favor of the auto stocks right now, and unfortunately, the trend doesn't appear to be drawing to a close. Expectations for revenue and earnings growth at Ford are very disappointing, as explained in a recent article by Josh Arnold . But having said that, does that mean we should steer clear of the segment altogether because the market isn't in favor right now? I don't think so. However measured, Ford and GM are both very cheap at the moment. Both stocks are also vastly improved from their post-recession states, with both now very profitable, Ford has even managed a profit in Europe for the past 4 consecutive quarters. Both stocks are growing revenue as well as earnings per share, with growth coming from increased sales and much needed higher margins, especially at GM. The two are offering yields of 4.47% and 4.87% respectively, with continued share buybacks only boosting these even higher. Both companies are developing new products, which are proving to be very popular. As a UK citizen, it is clear to see the popularity of Ford's new EcoBoost engines in the new Focus and Fiesta models, and the Mondeo (Fusion in the States) is selling much better than I ever expected. With this in mind, it is clear to see that both are very undervalued companies, with generous dividend yields, and a range of new products to ensure that growth continues for years to come. With the average age of the U.S. vehicle at an all-time-high, interest rates still relatively low and job creation strong, it should be a good time for the automakers. However, at least for the time being, the stock price has not kept pace with growth in the underlying business. The problem is not in the business; it's the stock itself. Both have traded far too cheap for far too long, with some investors losing patience. As a bond alternative or a pure income play, both Ford and GM are an attractive opportunity. The yield is incredibly safe, as well as being well over twice that of the S&P. Ford and GM may not be trading higher in 3, 6 or 9 months time, but as an income play with the opportunity for long-term stock appreciation, both companies are at the very top of my wanted list. I like both Ford and GM at these levels. Being 'cheap' should never be the sole reason to buy anything, but these stocks offer so much more than just a discounted stock price. Yields are strong, as is the pipeline of new vehicles. GM has made the shift away from high-volume low-margin fleet sales to the more profitable retail business, and Ford is growing margins in almost every region, as well as turning profitable what was once a money furnace. For anyone looking for long term gains and a bountiful income, both of these stocks should be high priority. It is important to remain diversified, and I stress my fears of near constant share prices for the immediate future, but these two stocks cannot be ignored when building a long term income portfolio.
