Ford: Can A Lincoln Rebirth Throw Sales Into Overdrive? - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha American luxury has struggled post-2008; including Buick, Cadillac and Lincoln. Ford announced plans to reinvent the Lincoln Continental, last produced in 2002. We just wrote about Ford (NYSE: F ) yesterday and we don't want to rehash the points we made in that article. We stated that we were confident in the company's ability to grow overseas and that we'll gladly collect Ford's dividend while waiting. You can read that piece here . Today, we wanted to issue a brief note talking about what the company is trying to do with the Lincoln Continental, which we think is a brilliant move and one that will continue to push the company forward. We know that for right now, the company is pushing its F-150 and Mustang as its two "flagship" vehicles. Part of Ford's growth comes from sales of these vehicles domestically but much of the future growth is from expansion into places like South Africa, India and China. Queued up for after that, the company is reloading its Lincoln line to supplement its two new vehicles and also to open up exposure to overseas buyers that may be interested in the company's luxury offering. The news today was that Lincoln will reintroduce the Continental, In recent years, Lincoln has mostly sold upgraded versions of Ford cars with little difference beyond the design and some added features. The Continental is, officially, a concept vehicle but something very much like it will go on sale next year, according to Ford ( F ). And the production car will also be called the Lincoln Continental, making it one of only two Lincoln models, along with the Navigator SUV, to have a name instead of letters like MKZ or MKC. The interesting thing is that Lincoln here in the U.S. isn't even necessarily synonymous with luxury anymore. It was a brand that was lost along the way, like Chrysler, and thrown into the pile of failed auto ventures after the financial crisis. Many investors, including ourselves, were happy to see names like Lincoln and Buick potentially on the chopping block. We thought their offerings were dated, their names were tarnished and that automakers would benefit from moving forward. Ford has found some success revitalizing Lincoln by making drastic design changes. They started this after Ford found its footing by using the '08 crisis as an opportunity to remake the brand design and the vehicle design. What we have now is a far younger, crisper, and stylish Lincoln. Lincoln stopped making the Continental back in 2002. Since then, the company has undergone a significant change to the branding and the imaging that they have been semi successful with. Heck, they even got Matthew Mconaughey to star in a well received commercial about their new SUV line. We think that reintroducing the Continental has several benefits to it; 1. We think it marks the continued rebirth of the Ford name and brand to a number of younger generations. While some consumers that were fans of the brand likely never dissented from it, the lot that shunned the brand during the crisis will start to notice that things are again picking up. 2. It allows high margin access to overseas markets, specifically China. Luxury items sell well in China, just ask Apple or Burberry. With a Chinese eye on American luxury, Lincoln should help the company roll out its plans of continued growth overseas in China and places like India, where the company recently broke ground setting up a production facility. What model is better to do this than the classic American continental. 3. We think it's going to help a global shift in how people think about luxury automobiles. While GM's (NYSE: GM ) Cadillac brand has a timeless feel to it, especially because of its ageless logo and "cool" factor, Buick and Lincoln haven't done well to keep American luxury on the map. Buick is undergoing a shift to a sportier vehicle, but we believe the brand is stuck spinning its wheels. Lincoln has a real chance to reignite a spark for those who consider "luxury" to only be European. This can help Ford, obviously, but it can also help the U.S. domestic auto sellers grow quicker overseas. One thing is for sure, Lincoln needs some help ; Lincoln sales dropped 7.5% in February to 6,164, and Cadillac sales fell 12.6% to 11,739. It is a guessing game whether the two huge American car companies will soldier on as they try to get an even modest part of the luxury market. The news was actually worse than that. Lincoln avoided a slaughter because of the sales of its MKC, which reached 1,558. Since the model was not for sale last year, for February 2014 Ford gets to make a comparison to zero. On the plus side as well, if it can be called that, Lincoln's beast of a sport utility vehicle (SUV), the Navigator, sold 862 units, up from 440 in the same month last year. Aside from that, Lincoln still has a model line that is disintegrating. Unimaginably, Lincoln sales could drop to as low as 5,000 a month. It could take a couple of quarters, but we're preparing to buy Ford for our dividend portfolio this week for a couple of reasons, The yield of 3.8% is attractive while you wait The global growth strategy is working, even if slowly Ford continues to be our preferred way to invest in the U.S. auto market. Here's a piece on why we have a target over $20. You can read why we wouldn't touch GM here. We may add Ford shares at any point in the future.
