Ford's Sales: A Promising Catalyst For Next Earnings Report? - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford's June sales had a big increase in trucks thanks to our cheaper oil prices. It stands to reason that their upcoming earnings report could be pretty nice. Ford (NYSE: F ) is one of those stocks that pulls you in so many different directions. On the one hand, this puppy just plain old won't break out of its $18-20 ceiling. On the other hand, they keep having good things happen to them. The company had a big jump in sales for June. Trucks were cited as one of the main catalysts for this pleasant surprise. I've written previously about both the good and the bad with the company. I was admittedly wrong about their truck segment, though no one really imagined we'd still have gasoline at these prices. It shouldn't come as a shock to us that people are buying more gas guzzlers while oil prices (and therein gas prices) are lower. As a whole, truck sales rose a whopping 24.2 percent while SUV's rose 7%. Down almost 9% from its 6-month high, now may be the time to get your hands on a little Ford stock. The company is still dishing out a pretty 4.79% dividend and the earnings are good. Aside from an economic disaster, I really like Ford. Their cash position of over $15 billion (Q1'16) is awesome. The balance sheet is getting cleaner and cleaner, and the cash flow is beautiful compared to 2014. After 2008, people have real Post Traumatic Stress about auto stocks. The firm is having one of its best years since 2006 (so far..) and yet the stock is still down. I can't blame investors. The idea of another car collapse is a frighteningly real thing in our minds. In an economics slowdown, you don't go out and buy a new car. There lies the rub with this company. It just won't go on a run. Heck, Friday you had great sales news and the stock was still only up 1.2%. Granted the markets are in a frenzy right now over the Brexit. Traders are probably delighted with the stocks spread between $12 and $19, but long term investors are getting a pretty uneventful deal here. Nevertheless the dividend is still just too strong to ignore. This equity offers an awesome trading play with a nice yield on the side. The stock closed today (07/01/2016) at $12.72. Over the last year we've been everywhere from $11.17 to $15.68. Assuming no big opens this morning (07/06/2016), you're looking at a buy in that's more than 6.7% below the 1 year average of $13.64. This variance is enough for a play on merely getting back to average. If you're an anti-"overlytechnicals" person like me, the real play is to buy now and watch what happens with the June 28th earnings report. If sales were like this for June, I'd say it's going to be a nice quarter for Ford. And hey, you're making an almost 5% dividend by having this stock anyway.
