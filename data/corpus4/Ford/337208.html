Trade The Parts, Not The Cars - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) | Seeking Alpha Car parts keep growing at 5% per year. O'Reilly has tremendous potential to outperform Ford. There are different ways to trade retail and consumer spending. In this article, I want to give you a trading idea based on two companies in different industries, but with the same focus: automotive products. The first company is O'Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ: ORLY ). The second one is Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F ). During the past few years, we've witnessed a disconnection between auto parts and car sales. While car sales have slowed and are now in contraction, car parts are performing extremely well and growing annually at around 5% since 2013. O'Reilly really benefited from the strong car parts industry. The company didn't have a year-on-year sales decline since its IPO in 1993. Not even the big recession of 2008 could stop ORLY. In fact, the biggest sales acceleration was between 2007 and 2008. The same goes for gross profits. Sales were almost flat between 2004 and 2008 and started to rally after 2009. Not only is top line growth impressing, but margins are astonishing too. In recent years, margins have increased every single year. Gross margins rose to 52.3% in 2015, while profit margins went up from 10.8% in 2014 to 11.7% in 2015. Furthermore, profit margins are expected to rise even further and hit 12.3% in 2016. The degree of financial leverage (DLF) is at 103.7, indicating that the results are not based on an overleveraged business model. O'Reilly's balance sheet not disturbing. The current ratio is at 1, which is slightly down from 1.09 in 2014. Adjusted for inventories, the quick ratio comes in at 0.12, which would mean a big chance of bankruptcy. However, it's not a problem, since O'Reilly needs these inventories to get business going in more than 4.500 stores nationwide. O'Reilly's growth is not over yet. At least not according to analysts. This year, EPS is expected to improve 16%, followed by almost 13% in 2017 and 12.3% in 2018. The average for the coming five years is at 15.1%. The auto parts stores industry is valued at 23.7 times earnings. O'Reilly is beating this valuation by almost 5 points. Taking future growth into consideration (PEG 1.9), we can say that the stock is not overvalued at these levels. Ford has a different story. The Michigan-based company is part of the auto manufacturers industry, which is valued at 13 times earnings. Ford is way below these levels, with a P/E of just 6.75 and average expected growth of just 7% for the coming five years. The economy is slowing since 2014, putting more pressure on both stocks. However, O'Reilly has received multiple up-revisions for future growth - more than 13 upgrades this year alone, plus 7 upgrades for next year's expectations. Ford, on the other hand, had slightly more downgrades than upgrades, which is probably due to weak car sales. I think that a ratio-spread trade between these two companies is interesting for the coming months. If you buy ORLY and short F, you have downside protection if the market collapses and will make money if the secular trend of car parts and auto sales continues. I consider a price between $18 and $19 to be a great entry point and expect ORLY to keep outperforming. Please be aware that position size, hard stops and soft targets are part of your own risk management.
