Ford: The Bullish Thesis Remains Unchanged - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Many investors have expected Ford shares to spike higher after good results. The company has followed through on its promises this year thus far. When Ford (NYSE: F ) reported results the other day many investors were upset to see that although the company beat most estimates the shares were still headed lower. As a Ford shareholder I too was a little disappointed to see this, however, as someone who believes the company can continue to perform I remain confident that at some point the market will reward this performance. I believe an important question to ask about any investment that one has held for a period of time is if the original thesis to the investment has changed. After Ford reported Q3 earnings I went ahead and asked myself if my reasoning for buying shares in the first place was still intact. The simple answer is yes. To take a deeper look into answering this we'd have to take a look back to when I first bought shares of Ford. Back on January 13th of this year I wrote a piece about why I had just bought shares. In the piece I answered the question of why I bought shares. In short, Ford looked positioned to have a great 2015. With seventy-five percent of the year behind us, I believe that thus far the company has had a great year. Overall my general thesis remains unchanged as we head for year-end. Since the thesis is unchanged I have no reason to be concerned over the lackluster performance of the shares. This does not mean that I am not somewhat frustrated over the performance of the shares. However, I do not expect the market to be a logical place all of the time, but do think at some point those who are patient will be rewarded. Of course, Ford must continue to improve and deliver on results for this to occur. Which brings us to looking forward. Expectations for 2016 are already looking extremely solid. Analysts are expecting EPS growth of 15%, and sales growth of 4.5%. This will be fueled in big part of the momentum that the auto industry is seeing. Sales forecasts are looking extremely strong to start Q4. Something I think some are overlooking is the very big possibility of a dividend hike looming on the horizon. Early in January of this year the company raised its dividend by 20%. This came as the company was coming off a 2014 that was fairly disappointing. With earnings improving dramatically from last year it may be safe to assume that the dividend could be hiked handsomely again. This would bring us to the fact that Ford shares currently yield around 4%. A dividend increase would push the yield much higher making the possibility that the market will react quite favorable a strong possibility. To put this in prospective, if the company were to raise the annual payout by 10% (to 66 cents) the shares (assuming they remain around this level) would yield 4.4%. In conclusion, my bullish thesis remains the same from the beginning of the year. While it is disappointing that the shares are around the same levels as I originally bought at, I am confident that the company's continued performance will be reflected in the shares at some point. In the meantime I am fine with being patient as the dividends continue to provide a return. Investors should keep in mind that a dividend raise is likely right around the corner and that shares will most likely react favorable to this news. With the bullish thesis unchanged I believe that shares of Ford continue to hold nice upside potential. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
