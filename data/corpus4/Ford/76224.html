Enterprise Product Partners L.P. Expands Its Eagle Ford Presence - Enterprise Products Partners L.P (NYSE:EPD) | Seeking Alpha Enterprise Product Partners is acquiring an Eagle Ford dry gas and NGL midstream system. Acquisition is part of a greater trend of E&Ps disposing of midstream assets. I believe that this type of acquisition will continue. The acquisition was done at a reasonable price, and should be accretive to distributable cash flow. The acquisition was small, but could be meaningful if Enterprise adds Eagle Ford customers to its midstream and downstream business. Just a few days ago Enterprise Product Partners (NYSE: EPD ) announced that it would acquire EFS midstream, an NGL and dry gas gathering system in the Eagle Ford. In doing so, Enterprise joined Kinder Morgan Inc (NYSE: KMI ) as a midstream business taking advantage of this price downturn by acquiring high-quality midstream assets that would otherwise not be for sale. Many E&P companies are facing cash flow issues, yet do not want to completely sell themselves to the bigger, integrated names. The short-term solution seems to be for these E&Ps to bolster their balance sheets by selling midstream assets. Kinder Morgan, for example, picked up Hiland Partners, the private midstream partnership of Bakken explorer, Harold Hamm. Enterprise's acquisition of EFS Midstream was cut from the same mold as the Kinder Morgan-Hiland acquisition. The selling entities in this case are Reliance Industries Limited and Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE: PXD ), the latter name is the largest producer in the Permian Basin by horizontal crude oil production. Enterprise focuses mostly on midstream NGL activity, but has significant natural gas pipeline assets as well. EFS Midstream is a good fit into the Enterprise system. The acquisition will add 460 miles of gathering pipe, ten central gathering plants with gas processing capacity of 780 million cubic feet per day, and condensate processing capacity of 119,000 barrels per day. Enterprise is purchasing EFS Midstream for $2.15 billion. While we don't exactly know the valuation of this transaction, Enterprise claims the acquisition will be accretive to distributable cash flow. Let's do a little deciphering to get a better idea of the dimensions of this transaction. EFS Midstream is currently about half-owned by Reliant Industries and about half-owned by Pioneer Resources. In its press release, Pioneer said it would be giving up $100 million per year in 'cash flow .' Assuming the cost in cash flow would be the same for Reliant, it is safe to say that Enterprise should gain $200 million in cash flow per year from this transaction. Considering a total consideration of $2.15 billion, Enterprise is paying roughly eleven times cash flow for this asset. It does get better than just that. Because this is a 'bolt-on' transaction, Enterprise may be able to sign on other producers to services provided by these assets. These producers could also be brought into Enterprise's NGL downstream service, thereby achieving even further accretion. Pioneer will commit production from its Eagle Ford acreage for the next twenty years. The agreement with Enterprise will be fee-based, so Pioneer will not pay for the actual handling of production, but instead will pay for the capacity in which to do so. In return, Enterprise promises to spend $270 million over the next ten years on improvements and expansions to the EFS Midstream assets, in an effort to support continued development of the Eagle Ford Shale. As long as the shale-focused names need to raise cash flow to continue drilling, I believe that we will see further acquisitions in this space. Midstream assets should continue to be the disposals of choice for shale-focused, North American E&Ps. One example of a possible future midstream divestiture is Whiting Petroleum (NYSE: WLL ). A few months ago Whiting was rumored to be up for sale entirely. However, senior investors were very reluctant and did not look forward to being shareholders of one of the big integrated names. Yet, Whiting could still need to raise cash sometime soon. I would not be surprised if Whiting's midstream assets were the next ones to go to the midstream MLPs. As for the Enterprise transaction, relatively speaking, this $2.15 billion acquisition is a small one for the $64 billion Enterprise Product Partners. However, Enterprise obtained some high-quality Eagle Ford assets at a good price. This deal won't move the needle too much, but it should still contribute generously to Enterprise's bottom line over the years. Source: Enterprise Product Partners L.P.
