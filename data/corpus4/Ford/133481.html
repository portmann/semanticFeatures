UPDATE 1-Fiat Chrysler reports robust quarter, narrows gap with U.S. rivals | Reuters MILAN/DETROIT, July 30 (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) reported robust growth in North American profit in the second quarter Thursday and boosted its full-year forecast, as the world's seventh-largest carmaker narrowed the gap with its bigger U.S. rivals. Trading in the Milan-listed shares of FCA was briefly halted due to excessive gains. Shares were up 4.6 percent at 9:46 a.m. ET (1346 GMT). In New York, shares were up 4.2 percent at $15.13. Improved earnings in the North American region, which contributed more than half of FCA's profits last year, should help Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne in his search for a partner to boost scale and share costs to build greener and smarter cars. Marchionne has been shopping around for a suitor, but his efforts for a tie-up so far have failed. Marchionne has promised to close the North American margin gap with GM and Ford by 2018. FCA's margins in the region rose to 7.7 percent in the quarter, from 4.9 percent a year earlier, boosted by better pricing, purchasing efficiencies and currency effects. This compares with Ford's 11.1 percent and GM's 10.5 percent. FCA, which moved its primary listing to New York in October and is due to spin off luxury unit Ferrari later this year, reported second-quarter adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of 1.525 billion euros ($1.67 billion), up from 968 million euros a year ago. That compared with a consensus forecast of 1.1 billion euros in a Reuters survey of 11 analysts. FCA's results follow strong performances from its Detroit peers: General Motors' quarterly earnings more than doubled, while Ford reported its highest automotive profit since 2000. Revenue jumped 25 percent to 29.2 billion euros, while net industrial debt stood at 8 billion euros at the end of June. The company slightly lifted its full-year guidance for revenue, while adjusted EBIT is now seen equal to or in excess of 4.5 billion euros from a previous range of 4.1-4.5 billion.
