Ford Motor: Take A Deep Breath, Don't Panic Just Yet - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford Motor's U.S. vehicle sales in May dropped off. Total sales dipped 5.9 percent Y/Y, but truck sales continued to remain strong, gaining 8.9 percent Y/Y. Investors are back into panic mode, fearing an earnings recession. Automakers have had a good run so far this year in terms of U.S. vehicle sales, but investors continue to maintain a healthy degree of skepticism toward them. Over the last two years investors have grown more and more skeptical about the pace of automakers' vehicle sales in the United States, essentially expecting them to fall off, and push automakers Ford Motor (NYSE: F ) and General Motors (NYSE: GM ) into an earnings recession. The share prices of Ford Motor and General Motors profoundly reflect such investor concerns: General Motors' shares, for instance, declined ~15 percent in value over the last year, whereas Ford Motor's share price slumped ~12 percent. And all of that happened while both General Motors and Ford Motor saw very solid sales growth in the U.S. Even a bullish outlook in terms of sales and earnings didn't shift investor sentiment at all, and neither did their boosted capital return plans. Ford Motor, for example, paid a $1.0 billion special dividend at the beginning of the year, to no avail: Investors are on strike, still concerned over a steep cyclical fall-off in sales, which continues to weigh heavily on Ford's shares. Unfortunately, fears over a cyclical cool-off in auto sales were fed again this week when Ford Motor said that its vehicle sales in the United States slumped 5.9 percent, which is obviously a large drop. Ford's car sales, expectedly, continued to fall last month, whereas truck sales came in strong yet again. Car sales dropped a whopping 25 percent to 67,315 vehicles in May while truck sales gained 8.9 percent compared to last year, and rose to 90,676 vehicles being sold. At the end of the day, however, Ford's sales dropped 5.9 percent, reigniting fears that U.S. auto sales for Ford have plateaued, which obviously was not good news for Ford's shares: They dropped 3 percent on deteriorating investor sentiment, again. Though sales dropped off at a rather high rate last month, it is too early to go into full-fledged panic mode: It was largely expected that U.S. automakers aren't able to sustain the high rate of auto sales growth that we have seen in 2015, but Ford's market valuation already accounts for such concerns. Ford's shares are selling for ~6.0x next year's earnings, reflecting a large margin of safety. Further, even though Ford's vehicle sales have dipped last month, the automaker is still solidly in positive sales territory for the year: Year-to-date, Ford's sales have grown 4.2 percent to 1,112,939 vehicles. Ford Motor deserves the benefit of the doubt at this point. Investors are reacting too harshly to Ford's drop-off in U.S. vehicle sales in May. Automakers have had a good run in 2015, and so far in 2016 (in terms of operations, not share price!), and both General Motors and Ford Motor have communicated their bullish outlook for 2016. Unfortunately, investors would have none of it, drifting off into panic mode after Ford released weaker-than-expected May sales. While I continue to see an uphill battle for Ford Motor and General Motors in terms of investor sentiment, the shares are still looking good from an income perspective: Ford throws off a ~5 percent dividend.
