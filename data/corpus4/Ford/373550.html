Clayton Williams Energy: Great Assets, Over Leveraged Capital Structure - Sell The Stock - Clayton Williams Energy, Inc. (NYSE:CWEI) | Seeking Alpha CWEI has enviable leasehold positions in both the Delaware Basin and the Eagle Ford Shale. Recent influx of liquidity will tide it over for some time. Good assets, overleveraged capital structure: that appears to be the problem with Clayton Williams Energy, Inc. (NYSE: CWEI ). CWEI owns valuable assets in both the Delaware Basin and the Eagle Ford Shale. In the Delaware Basin, CWEI position in the play is comprised of 66,000 net acres with over 400 drilling locations based on 160-acre spacing with potential EURs of 750 MBoe that consist largely (90%) of liquids. In the Eagle Ford Shale, CWEI has a 170,000 net acre position with over 600 locations to be drilled assuming 160-acre spacing. EURs in the Eagle Ford are estimated at 250 MBoe consisting of 95% liquids. Given the stacked pay potential of both assets, especially the Delaware Basin assets, it is clear that these assets would have significant value in a less depressed commodity pricing environment. On March 8, 2016, CWEI announced a transaction with Ares Management LP (NYSE: ARES ) that provided for a $350 million second lien term loan due in 2023 that would help CWEI fund its operations for the next several years to a time when commodity pricing would hopefully be improved. As part of the consideration, ARES was also provided warrants to purchase 2.25 million share of CWEI common stock at a strike price of $22.00/share. While I have not seen all the terms of this facility, CWEI management indicated that the facility contains a "springing maturity" feature like that found in the company's revolving credit facility. The "springing maturity" feature in the revolving credit facility is such that if CWEI has not refinanced or repaid its outstanding $600 million in 7.75% Senior Notes due 4/1/19, the maturity of the facility will be brought forward to 10/1/18. When CWEI reported its 4Q15 and full year 2015 results , it indicated that on a pro forma basis, it would have $207.8 million in cash after paying down amounts outstanding under the credit facility and $100 million in additional liquidity under an amended revolving credit facility. Together, these would provide for over $300 million in liquidity to tide the company over through this down-cycle. So far, so good. However, in the earnings announcement, the company also provided guidance for 2016. I used this information to generate a cash flow model for 2016 that suggests the company will only generate $35.6 million in EBITDAX in 2016. In developing this model, because I do like the assets, I used NYMEX 12-month forward strip prices for both crude oil and natural gas and not the historical values for the first months of 2016. In using these higher values, my model likely overstates the amount of cash generated. What this model suggests, is that the company will use a significant portion of the liquidity resulting from the ARES transaction to fund operations. Now this model does assume that CWEI pays the interest on the ARES facility at the cash rate of 12.5% on a quarterly basis. CWEI does have the ability to PIK the interest on the facility at a15% rate. Doing so would reduce the cash burn by $43.8 million and leave the company with $132.2 million in cash at year-end albeit the balance on the ARES loan would increase to approximately $405.5 million. If my model is at least directionally correct, I would expect to see CWEI exercise this PIK option. But what does this imply about the company's capital structure. Consider the following: Even on a market-adjusted basis, debt/Boe seems rather high on a relative basis. More importantly, leverage increases appreciably on a debt/EBITDAX basis. This implies that the debt should trade down. Using the year-end 2015 pro forma debt balances, if I set the calculation for debt/2016E EBITDA to 12.0x (still a high debt/EBITDAX multiple) and assume that the value of the ARES term loan remains at par (not a very good assumption but I do this for illustrative purposes only), the value of the CWEI bonds would likely fall into the 20's or lower. If the bonds decline this dramatically, it is likely that the equity will decline significantly as well. I would not be surprised if the equity were to decline into the low single digits, indicative of option value only. The company's property holdings in both the Delaware Basin and the Eagle Ford Shale potentially have significant value. While I think the implied valuation parameters for certain Delaware Basin acquisition and dispositions undertaken by Concho Resources (NYSE: CXO ) earlier this year are no longer applicable, the following table spreads the data from two of the transactions: If I use the average $/acre, this implies a valuation for CWEI's Delaware Basin properties in excess of $1.6 billion without ascribing any significant value to its properties in the Eagle Ford Shale. It is also the case that Reeves County, where CWEI has the bulk of its acreage, is amongst the most attractive acreage in the Delaware Basin. However, I think that, given what is happening to borrowing bases and the like, financing acquisitions in 2016 will prove challenging absent the significant use of equity funding. Further, the number of distressed assets on the market will likely increase in 2016. In recent days, attention has focused on companies such as Gastar , Anadarko and Chesapeake that have decided to sell assets or are rumored to be considering such sales. Given the much smaller universe of potential buyers, I think asset values will necessarily deflate. In February, a UK company, Nostra Terra, acquired properties in the Permian and the deal stats from that transaction are presented below. Note that Nostra Terra acquired only a 60% stake in the underlying properties. I have grossed the values to 100%: Despite the attractiveness of the underlying properties, I think that investors will focus on CWEI's inability to generate significant cash flow in 2016 and the implications of such limited cash flow for the future. The ability to finance capital expenditures will likely lag any improvement in commodity prices given the company's prospective debt load. Further, since the ARES facility will likely include make-whole and/or yield maintenance provisions (12.5% is exceedingly attractive for secured debt if conditions improve), it will be difficult for CWEI to get out from under this burden. For this reason, while I like the notion of shorting the debt, the current cost of carry, over 19%, is more than I would choose to pay as it would offset my expected gain. Instead, I think the right trade is to short the stock. The stock has been extremely volatile today, but if I am directionally correct about where the 7.75% Notes will trade (and the price of these dropped from 46 at the end of yesterday), the equity will likely decline. Great assets, overleveraged capital structure. CWEI has a strong legacy position in the Delaware Basin and an attractive position in the Eagle Ford Shale. However, with its recent second lien transaction, the company appears more overleveraged than before. And, if the guidance provided is reflective of actual performance, leverage is likely to increase. The bonds are overpriced but the expected price decline is effectively equal to the cost of carry. If the 7.75% Notes decline to the degree I believe, the equity will likely decline. Thus, I recommend shorting CWEI common stock.
