Don't Be Bullish On The U.S. Economy - Cramer's Mad Money (2/24/16) | Seeking Alpha Marc Benioff has 5% stake in Fitbit. All bad news on Apple is baked in the price. Stocks discussed on the in-depth session of Jim Cramer's Mad Money Program, Wednesday, February 24. Is the U.S. heading into a recession? Will the Fed raise rates in March? "When you look beyond the market's tight linkage to the price of oil, the idea that we could be headed into a recession has become a powerful theme, a whispered undercurrent in this environment that surfaces whenever oil takes a dive," said Cramer. He thinks the two conversations should be combined together, "We are going to have a recession and the Fed is going to raise rates right into it." Will the Fed put the U.S. into a recession? Cramer mentioned that he spoke to Ford (NYSE: F ) CEO Mark Fields who said that the biggest fear is investors talking themselves into a recession. Their stock sells at 5 times earnings, yields 6% including the special dividend. It's as if they are feeling the recession. Autos have started to peak. At least that's what the numbers and stock performances show. Housing was a bright spot until the Fed's rate hike in December. Home Depot (NYSE: HD ) numbers add excitement to housing, but the home purchases numbers in January show a different picture. Oil, on the other hand, has been in a bear market for a long time. Every time oil goes down, it takes the market down. "I know there aren't that many people in the oil business and it really only impacts nine states negatively, but recessions are about confidence and when you read the stories about the woes of the oil companies and those that lend to them, you really don't feel much confidence being inspired," said Cramer. The political saga shows how poorly the U.S. is doing as a nation as political candidates find flaws in each other. The 10-year treasury yield falling down to 1.7% is also a recessionary signal. On top of all these signs, the Fed's governors seem to be at a different tangent. "I almost wonder if they live in a vacuum. Who are they talking to? Don't they at least have some buddies who are concerned about a recession? Don't they know some people are pulling back from investing?" said Cramer. Cramer thinks that bullish Fed members are making a mistake and the economy is not ready for another rate hike. They should be in touch with what is on people's minds. CEO interview - Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen (NASDAQ: PLKI ) Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, the fried chicken chain was considered to be one of the best turnaround stories in the restaurant space. The company reported a $0.01 earnings beat, less than expected revenue, slowing same-store sales of 2.8% and weaker than expected guidance. Cramer interviewed CEO Cheryl Bachelder to hear more about the quarter. Bachelder said the mild tone on the conference call was because the company has adopted the approach of setting longer-term goals. "We announced new bold goals for Popeyes for the next 7 to 10 years, and a plan to really step up the performance of the company. So, that's really what I think we need to be focused on. We'll get after innovation and sharp price points and we'll be back to our strong performance," she added. The value pricing points by competitors has been affecting the business and Popeyes' new pipeline of products focusing on value pricing will be out soon. They also expect chicken prices to be better than last year. The company's technology initiative will put all franchises on one platform allowing better cost control, employee benefits, mobile payments etc. Bachelder said she is very excited about the initiative. On the market share, there is still more room for the company to grow market share in chicken in Bachelder's opinion. The company has authorized $200m of stock buybacks. They have refinanced so that the company has more flexibility to invest in organic growth and share buy-backs. More trouble for Williams-Sonoma (NYSE: WSM ) Williams-Sonoma is a home furnishings company with great brands such as Pottery Barn and West Elm. The stock price went up from $20 in 2010 to a peak of $89 in August 2015. Since then the stock has only plunged and is currently at $56. What went wrong all of a sudden? It was all good for the company with 50% of its sales coming from e-commerce and its growing presence in the U.K. and Australia. "If you would ask me to pick out a best-of-breed retailer a year ago, Williams-Sonoma would have been near the top of the list. Now it wouldn't even make the list," said Cramer. It started with August 2015 earnings which were weaker than expected. Poor guidance led to the stock plunging 9% in 2 trading sessions. The November report was weak as well, along with poor guidance. Analysts said that online home good retailer Wayfair (NYSE: W ) had similar goods which were less expensive and it was hurting Williams-Sonoma. Going further, if the Fed raises rates, it will only put more pressure on housing and hurt the company. "I worry about housing after that weak new homes figure we got this morning, despite what Home Depot said yesterday, and I worry very specifically about Williams-Sonoma. I'm not saying the mall is dead, but it's certainly on life support," said Cramer. The company is due to report earnings in March. Stay away from the stock unless the management gives clarity on the turnaround of their business. CEO interview - Salesforce (NYSE: CRM ) The stock of Salesforce has fallen 20% in 2016. Cramer interviewed chairman and CEO Marc Benioff to find out more about their last quarter and the future prospects. The company reported better than expected earnings and raised its full-year guidance. The company's operating cash flow is the amount of cash received from customers. It increased 38% and is at the highest level. This has been the best quarter for the company. They have helped companies like Charles Schwab (NYSE: SCHW ) and Unilever (NYSE: UL ) to modernize their old Oracle and SAP systems. The company also won 2 deals worth a billion dollars. The company is doing business with major banks which is helping them know their customers better. Salesforce is making it happen all from the phone. Commenting on the cloud business after the stock of Tableau (NYSE: DATA ) and LinkedIn (NYSE: LNKD ) tumbled impacting others as well, Benioff said, "There has been a great cloud washing, where every company says they are the cloud. But beware of the false cloud because there are many false clouds out there." A real cloud company is the one which has subscription models with deferred revenue, is customer-centric and focused on success. Benioff mentioned that he has 5% stake in Fitbit (NYSE: FIT ) since he is a fan of their technology and is a part of their community. "Have you noticed that they have thrown everything at Apple but the kitchen sink, and the darned thing just won't come down?" said Cramer. The first big blow came when they refused to break the phone for the FBI and next when presidential candidate Donald Trump called for boycotting the company. "Hate him or love him, Trump's got more airtime than anyone on Earth, and if he chooses to hammer Apple, it won't be positive for the company's sales," said Cramer. If Apple unlocks the phone, then China would want to do the same. China is a big growth market for Apple and the Communist party would want to boycott Apple's products along with Donald Trump. The third issue is that Apple channel inventory checks which suggest that iPhone sales have peaked have no credibility. There are new reports every day but Apple just keeps reporting solid sales. The excess inventory could be the reason for the rumored upcoming launch in March or iPhone 7 in the fall. Apple has a solid buyback program and every time the stock falls, Apple is buying it. Selling the stock when the company is buying could prove counter-intuitive. At 10 times earnings, the bad news is already baked in. "Apple could have some real upside later in the year, which is why I reiterate my view that you want to own this stock, not trade it," concluded Cramer. Fiat Chrysler (NYSE: FCAU ): Cramer is not a fan of Fiat. He likes General Motors (NYSE: GM ) because of the yield. Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK ): Cramer is not a fan of its core growth profile but likes American Electric Power (NYSE: AEP ) which is also his charitable trust's position. Groupon (NASDAQ: GRPN ): No, this is not overvalued. They have decent brands but need better management. Alibaba's (NYSE: BABA ) confidence in this business helps.
