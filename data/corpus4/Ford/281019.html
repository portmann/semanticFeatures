While that might be a molecule in a drop in the bucket, Ford claims it would be the largest fleet of autonomous vehicles operated by any carmaker. The car manufacturer plans to test the cars in California, Arizona, and Michigan this year. â€œI predict that 2016 will be a revolutionary year for the auto industry,â€?
