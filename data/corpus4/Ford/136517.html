Ford: Profitability Will Drive The Stock Price - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford's earnings were in line with our bull case on the company. Long term outlook for Ford continues to look positive. To refresh everyone on what our Ford (NYSE: F ) thesis has been since the beginning of 2014, we've stated that we think the only thing that could eventually drive shares higher would be growth on the bottom line. Looking at Ford's chart, you can clearly see that the stock has been unable to make a move past $20 since its recovery after the subprime crisis. Unlike competitor GM, Ford's capital has been tied up in innovating older brands (F-150, Lincoln Continental) and pushing the company across the globe. This has resulted in a short term waiting period for F stockholders, but a waiting period that we think will be well worth it when the bottom line begins to move upward. After the company's last earnings report, out early this week, we're encouraged that our thesis is correct and that the company is holding up its end of the bargain. As part of our research, we continue to track and watch auto sales and registration activity in the U.S. and overseas. So far, things continue to look favorable for the U.S. automaker. We plan on continuing our commentary and we're grateful for Ford longs that have reached out to us and provided encouraging words for our coverage. With Ford, it's great hearing from likeminded people, although (as with any stock) it's important to lend an ear to critics as well. Ford crushed earnings this past week on both lines, but most importantly to us, the bottom line. We have been making the case that global profitability, after Ford finally curbs spending internationally, will be the next catalyst for the stock price to move higher. If last week's report was any indication, we may have been right on target. We have said for a while that profitability globally (and the effect it will have on the bottom line) is going to be the next catalyst to stop Ford's stock price from being an immovable object. Value investing is about finding companies that have been overlooked by the market, or are simply valued at much lower than what they're potentially worth in coming years. Ford meets this description for us in so many ways and the missing link that would let the market in on this, Ford's global profitability, could be coming to fruition sooner than the market thinks. Literally, every part of the company's business that we watch closely showed strength, Ford ( F ) grew pretax profit by 10% to $2.9B in Q2 . Operating margin was up 60 bps to 7.2%. North America: Revenue $23.3B, operating margin -50 bps to 11.1%, volume and pricing strong, record profit level for the quarter. South America: Revenue $1.5B, operating margin +160 bps to -12.4%, strong demand for the Ka model. Europe: Revenue -14% to $7.0B due in part to F/X, operating margin -40 bps to -0.2%. Middle East/Africa: Revenue $0.9B, operating margin -710 bps to -5.1%, wholesale volume down 10%. Asia Pacific: Revenue $2.4B, operating margin +230 bps to 7.8%. Now, let's compare what we've stated on the record that we're looking for (a strong domestic base coupled with coming global profitability) with the points Ford touched on in its last earnings report. What did we see from the company? 1. We saw the company again lose money in South America and Europe, but we also saw record profits in North America. 2. Like we discussed in our previous article that talked about the F-150 incentive confusion, we also saw a higher average transaction price and continued momentum across the company's full scope of vehicles. 3. We saw that the company is meeting its margin target, which was support to be between 8.5% and 9.5%. With the new line of F-150's that are going to be made (also outlined in a previous article) we expect margin to continue to trend higher from the 9.1% number posted this past quarter. 4. Even though money was lost in Europe, we saw an improvement there, which is all we wanted. Ford was the leading commercial auto name in Europe for the first quarter. The company continues to bet on Europe, where it will be introducing new models in coming years. This bet on innovation and getting a foothold overseas, we believe, will benefit Ford shareholder who have an investing horizon of far more than a couple of years. 5. China was a tough market for Ford in the first. The exchange rate was a tailwind for Ford at the beginning of the year and the number of vehicles sold was consistent with the year prior. With China's economy in turmoil right now, combined with a slowdown across the board, we're still bullish on China, but cautious for the second half of the year. Our outlook on being a Ford investor has always been over the course of the long term and we're encouraged by the results that the company provided last week. We continue to believe that at today's valuation, Ford remains an attractive stock to (if not anything else) hold and collect the dividends from for the time being.

We continue to believe that as investments in these companies top out or start to slow and the operating leverage begins to take hold the narrowing losses and eventual bottom line growth from its international markets, backed by strong domestic sales, will be the catalyst that drives Ford shares higher.
