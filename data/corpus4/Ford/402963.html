Ford And GM: No-Brainer Buys - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford currently has a PEG ration of only .8 and a P/E of 6.0. GM is even more impressive at .3 and 4.6. Dividend investors will love Ford's 4.46% and GM's 4.91% dividend. Ford and GM are what I call Dividend/Value/Growth Hybrid stocks. There is a lot to love and the downside risk seems low at the current share price levels. Both companies will likely gain traction with investors as they continue to perform very well. The outlook for the automobile sector continues to be strong worldwide although there is tremendous competition for each company. An economic global downturn would be a strong headwind. Both General Motors Co. (NYSE: GM ) and Ford Motor Co. (NYSE: F ) are currently excellent investment opportunities based on various metrics of performance and share price. Each company qualifies for what I call a Growth/Value hybrid stock AND they each qualify as solid high dividend stocks as well. Neither stock will likely be a home run play in 2016, but each offers a very good measure of safety while one collects a dividend well above 4% (GM currently 4.91% and Ford at 4.46%). When looking at the very best high quality stock buys on the market, I like to find companies that do very well based on objective financial metrics AND rate well based on highly respected stock ranking systems. In my own research, I recently looked for 5 Star S & P IQ stocks that pay a dividend of at least 2.5% and is at PEG ratio below 3.6. Only 11 stocks passed through these screens and Ford and GM each outperformed the other 9 significantly on these metrics. In fact, both companies have superb PEG ratios: GM at 0.3 and F at .8. The P/Es of each was also the best of the list with Ford at 6.0 and GM at 4.6. As a bonus, each company also rises to the top for another respected stock ranking system: GM gets a perfect 10 rating from Thomson Reuters and F gets a very respectable 8. There is a lot to love for investors with either of these stocks. Based on the current valuations and earnings, each company has a limited downside risk at this point. The low short float of each company reflects this fact with GM only at 2.9% and Ford at 3.74%. The Risk Reward equation looks firmly in favor of Reward right now for investors in these high quality companies. Both S&P IQ and Thomson Reuters rankings confirm this opinion. Almost any type of investor should take a close look at both Ford and GM shares right now. Dividend investors will obviously appreciate the very nice dividend yields. Value investors have to love the metrics. Even growth investors will like that each company has seen solid earnings and sales growth in recent quarters. Of the two stocks, GM edges out Ford on basically every metric, so if one must pick between the two, GM would be the winner based on objective financial criteria. However, Ford is a very close second and beats every other automotive company besides GM. Ford is also positioned well in China with its massive market potential. Some investors with long memories will also remember that Ford was the only member of the "Big Three" U.S. Automakers not to need a bailout during the last major recession. While this author believes that each of these high quality stocks are solid investments right now, the automotive market is cyclical and has risks. Any significant U.S. or global economic downturn would likely be quite challenging for each company. Also, the automobile industry has tremendous competition. For example, some investors believe that Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) has disruptive technology that will threaten companies like Ford and General Motors in the near future and may well be a current headwind. Given the competition and the cyclical nature of the industry, neither F nor GM shares are buy-and-hold-forever types of investments. An investor who buys shares should monitor economic and industry trends when making decisions on whether to add shares, hold or sell. In summary, by virtually every objective financial metric, the stock of both the Ford Motor Company and General Motors Company are excellent investment opportunities currently. One can collect well over 4% while waiting for the rest of the market to catch on that these companies are in the top one percent of all large and mid cap stocks based on objective metrics and the ranking of S&P IQ.
