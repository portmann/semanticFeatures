Ford Stock: At A Point Of Maximum Negativity - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in F over the next 72 hours. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. The major U.S. automaker stocks continue to fall as investors are panicked about peak car sales. I believe the overwhelming pessimism has gone too far. Ford is still growing sales in the U.S. and future growth potential is alive and well in the international markets. Ford investors will receive a 7% dividend this year, 5% thereafter, and the stock trades for a 10 P/E. Ford stock is a tantalizing investment for value and income. To say that 2015 was a frustrating for the U.S. automaker Ford Motor (NYSE: F ) and General Motors (NYSE: GM ) would be putting it mildly. Over the past year, both Ford and GM stocks have not performed well. They are each in the red and both badly lagged behind the broader market. Their underperformance is even more confusing when you consider the fundamental tailwinds each company had coming into 2015. And in truth, they did-each company posted strong sales and earnings last year. Still, investors couldn't care less about their success. Instead, investors are focusing on the troubles that may come to pass up ahead. The market is deeply discounting Ford and GM on fears that peak auto sales have passed, and that a looming global recession will cause their earnings to significantly deteriorate. But that's simply not rational. Both automakers, and particularly Ford, are very attractive picks for both value and income. If and when the market comes to its senses, their valuations should be much higher than where they are today. Automakers Have the Wind at Their Backs Ford and GM were supposed to benefit from low gas prices, low interest rates, and the gradual U.S. economic recovery. Oil is at $30 per barrel, and AAA reports U.S. gas prices recently fell below $2 a gallon on average for the first time since 2009. In addition, while the Federal Reserve raised interest rates last month, interest rates remain extremely low in the U.S., and are likely to only rise from here at a very gradual pace. Lastly, two of the biggest indicators of car sales-the housing and labor markets-continue to improve. These are all very positive data points for automakers. As a result, Ford's fundamentals are improving as well. Total car sales in the U.S. rose by 5% last year. In particular, the F-Series pickup truck continues to dominate its peer group. In December , the Ford F-Series sold more than 85,000 vehicles for the first time in a decade. The F-Series has been America's best-selling vehicle for the past 34 years. Ford is also seeing success in sport utility vehicles, due largely to low gas prices. Ford's SUV sales rose 13% last month, led by the Escape, Edge, and Explorer models, making it the best December for SUV sales since 2003. This has all had a great effect on Ford's earnings. Over the first nine months of 2015, earnings per share grew 2.5% from the same period the year before. For the full year 2015, pre-tax profit is expected to come in at the top end of the $10 billion-$11 billion range. That would set a new record for the company. For 2016, Ford expects pre-tax profit, operating earnings per share, and revenue to be comparable with or higher than 2015 levels, so it's hard to see what all the negativity is about. While investors are panicking about the slowdown in the emerging markets, I believe Ford still has a fantastic future growth catalyst to support earnings going forward. Ford is just scratching the surface on growth potential in emerging markets like China. Last quarter, Ford earned a $20 million pre-tax profit in the Asia-Pacific region. And, its profitability in mature markets like Europe is rapidly improving. Ford's European vehicle sales rose 10% in 2015, far better than the industry average of 3% growth in Europe. Ford's stock has punished investors over the past year. Going forward, the good news is that investors have a great buying opportunity. Ford stock trades for just 10 times earnings and offers a 5% regular common stock dividend. These are very attractive levels on a historical basis. Ford is cheaper than it has been, and offers a higher dividend yield, than at any point in the past five years--and by a wide margin. Ford's dividend is a manageable 50% of trailing earnings, so absent another worldwide financial crisis, I think the dividend is sustainable, and can actually rise in future years as Ford's earnings grow. Even better, Ford's recently declared $0.25 per share special dividend takes its effective dividend yield up to 7% this year, and 5% thereafter. Even when assuming no further dividend growth from here, investors can generate a high yield on cost simply from reinvesting those dividends. Of course, if Ford manages to increase its dividend at any point in that time (which I view as highly likely), then the yield on cost will be even higher. Both Ford and GM are interesting value and income plays for their low P/E ratios and high dividend yields. Of the two, I prefer Ford-it continues to hold the best-selling vehicle in the U.S. for nearly three decades, and GM's consumer image took a big hit from the recall scandal that still lingers today. I also see Ford as the stronger company across several models, including both pickups and SUVs, two of the major beneficiaries of low gas prices. Ford stock is at a point of maximum negativity. Some may avoid the stock because of this, out of fear of further declines, but value and income investors should see this as a buying opportunity.
