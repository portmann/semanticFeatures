Ford's Frugal Engineering In India A Sign Of Progress - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha India has been a tough market for Ford to make an impact, dominated by Asian competitors.. Ford is now following a time tested plan of lower cost engineering to make compact vehicles specifically for India. With our long term long position in Ford (NYSE: F ) we're not betting on the company having a great year this year, we're betting on the company's meticulous selection of capital allocation into select investments to fuel its growth globally over the long term. We've called Ford a win/win before because we have a very long term time frame in holding the company and in the meantime collecting the company's yield of almost 4%. We've been covering all of the news that comes out of the auto maker to see how it stacks up with our bull case on the company. The latest report we wrote was about continued demand for the company's F-150 domestically, a sign that the company's "backbone" of sales remains firm. Expanding from firm sales here in the U.S., we're mostly betting on Ford's ability to move itself globally and position itself to major populous countries like India and China. Our argument is that the company's investments in these areas would help out in the future in the form of bottom line improvement. For those with a short term view asking when or why Ford's stock is going to finally move higher, we believe that a tick up on the bottom line will finally be the fuel that does that. The company has employed different strategies for different locales, which we've pointed out in the types of vehicles they're manufacturing as well as the way they are advertising. This week it's being reported that the company is going to continue making geographical-specific changes to fine tune its international business. The company announced that it's going to launch a smaller car specifically for India. The car is called the Figo Aspire and will be launched this Wednesday. Ford plans on using the engine from this vehicle to fit other compact vehicles that will go to Africa and Asia. Obviously, for those that travel internationally, it's clear that U.S. "supersizes" its vehicles when companies to locales like India, or many parts of Europe. From a Reuters article , "This market, probably even more than Brazil, is demanding cost strategies and cost structures that are lower than anywhere else," he said. B-cars, loosely defined as compact cars, are key to the growth of automakers like Ford in India and beyond: global sales of such cars are expected to rise by more than a third to 11.4 million by 2020, according to analysts at IHS Automotive. India is expected to become the world's third largest market by 2020, when sales of B-cars are expected to double to around 1.73 million, IHS Automotive added. Ford did not say how much the Aspire would cost ahead of its launch, but executives said that 80 percent of the car had been made locally to keep the price low. As the same article noted, it's going to be tough to compete against Asian competitors making compact cars, but at least Ford should be able to tap into the vein in India a little further with compact cars designed specifically for the locale. While not a major development in the Ford long case, we view this as a sign that the company continues on the right track overseas and that they're committed to getting their global business on track and efficiently operational. As we said in our last article and we continue to say, the company is continuing to roll out its foothold globally and become an international powerhouse in the automotive market. We continue to believe that as investments in these companies top out or start to slow and the operating leverage begins to take hold the narrowing losses and eventual bottom line growth from its international markets, backed by strong domestic sales, will be the catalyst that drives Ford shares higher.
