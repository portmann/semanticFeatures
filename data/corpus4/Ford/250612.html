Ford says to incur $600 million expense in 2015 from U.S. union pact | Reuters A Ford logo is seen during preparations for the 2014 LA Auto Show in Los Angeles, California November 18, 2014. DETROIT Ford Motor Co said on Monday it will incur a $600 million expense this year tied to its new four-year contract with the United Auto Workers union in the United States. The expense is consistent with the company's previously stated expectations for 2015, according to a statement issued by Ford. Most of the $600 million expense are tied to a ratification bonus for the company's nearly 53,000 UAW members. That bonus works out to $10,000 per worker, including $1,500 in 2016 profit sharing. The UAW announced on Nov. 20 that its members at Ford had narrowly voted to ratify the new four-year contract.
