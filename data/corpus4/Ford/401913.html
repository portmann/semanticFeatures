Ford: Analysts Revise Estimates In Wake Of Earnings - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford beat expectations and delivered record results, again. 2016 guidance is light and the stock is undervalued. Analysts are revising the estimates for this year and next year. Weaker than expected US auto sales and pessimism in the auto market have shares of Ford (NYSE: F ) and other major auto makers languishing. Despite the general malaise affecting the market Ford remains a leader in the field and poised to make gains this year. Recently released results show underlying momentum in the company's earnings power and have sparked a recent round of analyst upgrades which belies the stock's low valuation. Based on Ford's first quarter results alone, company guidance for 2016 earnings to be "as good or better than last year" is understated and the analysts tend to agree. I won't rehash them again. I'll suffice to say that it was another record quarter, driven on sales and growing margins. According to data gleaned from Yahoo Finance, MarketWatch and other sources of market information expectations for the current quarter, full year and next year have all seen upward revisions in the last quarter, month and week. Current quarter consensus estimates on Yahoo Finance has risen $0.04, or 7%, in the last three months with a full penny increase, 1.66%, over the last week alone. Full-year 2016 consensus has also risen substantially, gaining $0.11 or 5.6% over the past quarter, more than half of that in the last week alone. This represents an 8.3% increase in year-over-year earnings and, in my opinion, well above "equal to or better." The pace of growth of car sales is slowing on a global basis but remains strong overall. April sales in the US and China were a bit weaker than expected but still positive year over year. US sales came in below expectations but are up 4%. Sales in Asia were stronger and led by China where year-to-date sales are up 7%. Sales in Europe were up 14% in the first quarter with increased market share and on pace to smash records set last year. The caveat is that Ford's earnings growth is expected to slow in the second half of the year. Current quarter, fiscal Q2, should see EPS of $0.61, growth of 64% over last year. Next quarter is expected to see earnings of only $0.41, a decline from last year, with growth returning in the fourth quarter. Trailing and forward looking P/E are low, in the range of 6.5%, for a blue chip and well below the 16X earnings currently offered for the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA: SPY ). Compared to historical valuation this above the historic low, near 2X earnings, but below average, near 10X earnings, which also suggests an undervaluation. Trying to price Ford relative to the broader market may not make sense. It habitually trades at a lower valuation, but pricing it relative to it's own historic average P/E does. This method also provides a target consistent with the expectations of analysts. The average analyst price target for this stock is $16 with a high of $20, ten times forward earnings is $21.10. This provides a target for potential gains in the range of +20% to +60%, not counting the dividend. The current yield, paid quarterly, is 4.5% and much better than the 2% or 2.25% paid by SPY or DIA . Last year's profits led to a nice special dividend which puts the annual yield above 7% and could be repeated at the end of this year. The bottom line is that Ford continues to produce results. Even though global sales growth has slowed global sales have not and this will lead to record profit this year and next. The stock is undervalued by at least 20% in my opinion and I'm not the only one who thinks so. An article in Barron's sees at least 25% upside for both Ford and GM (NYSE: GM ) over the next 12 to 18 months. The best part is that the stock pays a dividend, better and safer than the broad market, and has a better than average chance of paying another special distribution at the end of the year.
