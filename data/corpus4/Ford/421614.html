Why I Sold Ford - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford reported disappointing May sales, and so did the rest of the auto industry. Demand may be peaking in tandem with weakening macro economic growth and interest rates rising. As may not be obvious, I am a bullish supporter of Detroit. Thus, it pains to admit that today I parted ways with one of my longest tenured positions, Ford (NYSE: F ). The volatile run included 100%+ gains and 50%+ losses, a fat dividend, and plenty of bashing my head in the wall to understand why the company's valuation would not rise. I think the US auto market is showing signs of slowing, and the US economy, which generally drives demand aggregate demand, is fairly weak. Combine these short-term headwinds with longer-term issues surrounding new technologies and concerns about millennial demand, and I simply do not believe the risk/reward is that attractive at current levels. I am not generally make macro calls, but as I've mentioned before, I do not believe the auto market can support demand in excess of current levels. I warned in February that the auto market was starting to slump at the dealer level, which tends to foreshadow weakness at the OEMs to come. It appears that weakness is coming to fruition. Ford's sales declined 6% y/y . Car demand slumped the most, with total Ford car sales dropping 25% y/y. Given the upward move in fuel prices, one would assume car sales would at least be stable. Even more troubling, incentive-spending industry wide increased 11% y/y. Though the month was undoubtedly impact by fewer selling days, a 25% y/y drop in cars coupled with a 6% overall drop suggests that Ford is losing traction. On the positive side, demand for the F-Series remains strong. However, remember that the company is lapping a modest 2015, so a 9% y/y increase in F-Series sales is not as robust as it appears. Sales of the F-Series do possess higher margins than average Ford vehicles, but it is important to remember that operating leverage cuts both ways for a capital intensive business like Ford. If the company has to cut production, margins could fall dramatically. From the industry's perspective, sales were pretty weak across the board, falling 6% y/y at an aggregate level. The SAAR remained fairly robust at 17.45M units, but the pace is down y/y and down from late 2015's 18M unit SAAR. GM's (NYSE: GM ) sales were down 3.5% y/y with a 29% decline at cash cow Cadillac. Fiat (NYSE: FCAU ) sales were up just 1.1%, while Toyota (NYSE: TM ), Honda (NYSE: HMC ), and Nissan all experienced y/y declines. The above chart is what truly makes me the most anxious about the state of the auto market. Outstanding auto loan debt is making new all-time highs, as it should given population growth and inflation; however, it is significantly outpacing both on a per-capita basis. Clearly, some of this is due to a change in credit policy and behavior, but I also believe it means we are due for some defaults. Delinquencies are essentially half way between the cyclical high of 5.3% and the cyclical low of 2% at 3.5%. That number is up from 3.3% a year ago. In short, I do not believe an overexpansion of auto credit is likely to cause a major economic downturn. Investors fear any time the term "subprime" is addressed in the context of lending, but subprime auto loans are not likely to cause a major shift in aggregate demand. However, I think the primary takeaway should be that given the amount of credit outstanding, the borrowing capacity of incremental buyers is probably not very high. It will be difficult for easy credit standards to drive much higher sales at this point in time. I am not a macro trader, but it is impossible for any analyst not to pay attention to fundamentals. GDP growth was an anemic 0.8% in Q1 of 2016, down from an already weak 1.4% in Q4 of 2016. Measuring GDP is obviously an imperfect science, and labor markets remain tight, but I think it is fair to say that the economy, particularly consumption, is sluggish. Additionally, comments from the Federal Reserve suggest that tight labor markets could cause inflation, which could then lead to a rate hike. Higher interest rates could dampen demand for autos. We haven't really had a non-ZIRP environment in a long time; so higher rates could also cause a general recession. I'm not feeling particularly great about the economy. On top of potential economic issues, the fact remains the same that investors are universally worried about new technology. Both Uber (Private: UBER ) and Lyft (Private: LYFT ) are seeing robust valuations and investors, particularly those in cities where rideshare services have made owning a car less necessary, are fearful that these companies will at the very least reduce the number of fleet buyers, and the very worst, take millions of vehicles off the road. In addition to Uber and Lyft, their close technological peer, self-driving cars remain an unknown. Ford CEO Mark Fields believes it will take 15-20 years to mature, and another 15-20 years for the fleet to turnover. I believe the consensus opinion at the moment is that the change will come dramatically faster. I tend to agree with Fields, but markets value certainty and potential. At the moment, Ford has a lot of uncertainty and a lot of risk-not a winning formula. The long-term future of the auto market is rather uncertain and experiencing a higher rate of technological change than has been the norm in recent decades, and I haven't even explored the Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) wild card. With a near-term peak in auto sales looking more likely as the year progresses, I fear a decline in earnings for Ford is on the horizon. The company does not trade at a premium multiple (6-7x earnings), but I think shares will be harshly punished by any decline in profitability. While I think the company can still generate a lot of cash at the current SAAR, several metrics are pointing to a decline in auto sales. At current prices, I think the risk/reward of Ford shares is not compelling.
