Another Way Ford Is Delivering Value - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford's long-term investment proposition has been under scrutiny over the past week, but investors shouldn't be moved. The company's focus on fuel economy is a long-term growth driver. The long-term investment proposition of Ford Motors (NYSE: F ) has been placed under scrutiny over the past week, owing to the year-over-year decline in sales the company reported for the month of March. A contributory reason for the heightened scrutiny is that the company also reported a year-over-year decline in sales in February. Ford reported overall sales of 235,929 vehicles for the month of March, representing a 3 percent decline compared to the sales from the same period one year ago. In addition, for the month of February, the company reported overall sales of 180,383 vehicles, representing a 2% decrease compared to February 2014. While these trends doesn't offer any hope on the surface, I believe that there are a couple of things that investors can be optimistic about. I'll discuss one in here. Overall, investors should love Ford for what it stands for - providing long-lasting value to its customers. In my last article here on Seeking Alpha, I discussed how Ford has been committed delivering long-lasting value by focusing on fuel-efficient vehicles, and how the benefit has been obvious in the company's gross margins. Moreover, as I said the article, if you cast your mind back to the beginning of Ford, you'd find that Henry Ford originally started the company to offer long-lasting value - manufacturing vehicles that the average American can afford. Are great to sit in (second home comfort, convenience, exceptional quietness) Provide fuel economy as a reason to buy Provide exceptional value and quality The part that I like the most is where it says it aims to produce vehicles that provide fuel economy as a reason to buy. The steps the company is taking to make this vision a reality position the company for better profitability in future. Let's look a bit into that vision. Ford F-150 is one of the products through which Ford has been trying to promote fuel economy as a reason to buy. In fact, MainStreet included F-150 in a list of "10 Most Fuel-Efficient Vehicles of Their Class for 2015." And the company is even driving further by ditching the vehicle's steel body for a body made of aluminum. The Car Connection reported towards the end of March that insurance rates for 2015 F-150 remain steady, despite the uncertainties surrounding the new aluminum body. This quickly struck me, since experts were expecting the modification to bring about higher insurance rates. Among other things, increase in repair cost a big reason why experts expected higher insurance rates. However, Ford had taken certain steps to ensure that the modification doesn't result in higher insurance rates . Logically, I would expect that the company would take similar steps with other models to ensure that its fuel-efficient autos don't break the bank to insure. Therefore, customers might actually be able to save on both gas costs and insurance costs. In the end, this could encourage higher adoption of Ford autos. Here are some of the steps Ford has taken to keep insurance costs in check. First, as The Car Connection reported, the company factored the higher prices by building the new F-150 in such a way that it allows bodywork and repairs to be performed on a smaller scale. In essence, owners of F-150s that need bodywork can decide to replace only a small and cheap part of the aluminum body instead of replacing a large aluminum panel. This would always be beneficial to keeping repair costs at reasonable levels. In addition, a Ford spokesperson told caranddriver last year, when speaking about the cost of aluminum, that, "while high-strength aluminum alloy is more expensive than steel on a pound-for-pound basis, we've developed manufacturing efficiencies to reduce this cost as much as possible." Considering that Ford would be largely involved in the manufacture of spare parts for the new F-150, a takeaway from this statement is that Ford has also taken steps to ensure that repair costs will be bearable. Still in an effort to keep repair costs in check, the company also said that it planned to certify and EQUIP 750 of its dealerships to deal with collision repairs on the new F-150. Ford also said it planned to certify 2000 additional independent shops to handle the same work. As I stated earlier, all of these steps would, to some extent, keep insurance rates in check. And there was another point from an expert that suggests that the change shouldn't cause any drastic change in the F-150's insurance costs. Dr. Robert Hartwig, President and Economist at the Insurance Information Institute, told caranddriver in the story I referenced above that: The portion of most drivers' insurance premiums devoted to collision repair is rather small, with the majority given to liability coverage. Given that comprehensive and collision typically makes up about a third of a premium, any increase in repair costs won't drastically affect overall premium rates. This also goes to say that expecting drastically high insurance rates based on high estimated repair costs is not a complete analysis. Moreover, since Ford carefully chose aluminum alloys that have similar tensile strength to that of steel, we shouldn't expect that the new F-150 is so fragile that it can't even carry a 10-yard dumpster without cracking. By way of bringing it together, I would say that, with the steps Ford is taking to keep higher costs associated with producing fuel effect vehicles in check, we could expect that consumers won't suffer by paying higher insurance premiums. And as I stated earlier, this could be a major sales driver for Ford as the world shift focus to fuel economy.
