May U.S. auto sales drop for GM, Ford as FCA up slightly | Reuters DETROIT The U.S. auto industry looks set for another record year, even as May new-vehicle sales reported so far on Wednesday showed a decline due to weak demand for sedans and fewer selling days. Ford Motor Co (F.N), which reported a 6 percent drop to 235,997 vehicles from a year earlier, estimated a sales decrease of about 8 percent for the U.S. industry in May. The declines for the month are not generally seen as the start of a slide for industry auto sales, an early snapshot of consumer spending. Most analysts had expected a drop, in large part because of two fewer selling days and one less weekend this past month. Still, the sales declines for most automakers "could imply near-term pressure for auto stocks," said Barclays Capital analyst Brian Johnson. Shares of General Motors Co (GM.N), the largest U.S. automaker, were down 3.4 percent at $30.23 in morning trading, while Ford fell 3.4 percent to $13.04. GM reported an 18 percent decline to 240,450 vehicles. In pickup trucks, sales fell 12.7 percent for its Chevrolet Silverado and decreased 7 percent for its GMC Sierra. GM sales fell more steeply than analysts expected. The company had slowed production at three of its plants that make sedans, which hurt May sales, the company said. A year ago, the Cruze compact sedan was GM's top-selling car, but its sales fell 30 percent in May. The Malibu midsize sedan, which gained 13 percent, replaced it as the company's best seller in that category. Industrywide, trucks and SUVs remained the U.S. industry's most popular vehicles, to the detriment of traditional sedans. Mark LaNeve, Ford U.S. sales chief, said the skew toward pickup trucks and SUVs "really plays into Ford's wheelhouse." The same can be said for the two other major U.S. automakers, GM and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU.N) (FCHA.MI), which also have strong lineups and sales of SUVs and pickup trucks. Generally, profit margins are higher for the larger vehicles. Ford's car sales fell 25 percent. Sales were essentially flat for its SUVs and up 9 percent for its trucks. Sales for the best-selling vehicle in the U.S. market, the company's F-Series pickup, rose 9 percent. Among Ford sedan sales, the Fusion fell 21.5 percent, and the Focus dropped 27 percent. Sales rose 5.5 percent for the company's top-selling SUV, the Escape. FCA said its sales rose 1 percent to 204,452 vehicles on a 14 percent gain for its Jeep SUV brand. The company was the only major automaker in the U.S. market for which analysts had not expected a decline. FCA's Ram pickup truck sales fell 3 percent in May but are still up 8 percent for this year. Nissan Motor Co (7201.T) said its sales fell 1 percent. Forty economists polled by Thomson Reuters expect on average a seasonally adjusted selling rate of 17.3 million vehicles for May, not greatly changed from April but down from 17.8 million a year earlier. In 2015, vehicle sales were a record 17.47 million vehicles, according to Autodata Corp.
