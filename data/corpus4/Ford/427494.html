The Irrational Pessimism Of Ford, GM And Chrysler - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Irrational pessimism continues to pervade auto stocks. The idea that Tesla is worth more than half of GM or Ford is ridiculous. Ever since the Great Recession ended investors have been waiting for shares in General Motors (NYSE: GM ), Ford (NYSE: F ) and Chrysler (NYSE: FCAU ) to stage a comeback. They haven't. All three are today trading below where they were in 2010, when Fiat Chrysler re-emerged as a stock. Fiat-Chrysler had a nice run in late 2014 and early 2015, but it's now 20% below that late 2010 level, while GM is down 13% and Ford 17%. What's going on? By any conventional measure, these stocks are dirt cheap. Ford is priced at a price/earnings multiple of 6, despite a multi-year string of profitable operations. The P/E of GM is now down to 4.4, despite a 38 cent/share dividend that yields over 5% and that was covered by earnings more than four times last year. These companies are cash flow monsters. Both throw off about $15 billion per year in operating cash flow. These figures, too, have been rising for the last four years. It's not like they're not investing. GM continues to add debt, but even $63 billion in debt is sustainable when you have assets of $193 billion. Ford carries even more debt - $93 billion on assets of $257 billion, but even that is a sustainable level for a manufacturing concern. It can't be because cars are out of favor. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) makes no money, has little prospect of making money any time soon, and will, even if it meets its production goals, be making a tiny fraction of the big three's output by 2020, yet it's now worth nearly $36 billion. That's just $10 billion short of GM and $17 billion short of Ford. It's not like the auto makers are shy about change, either. GM has bought into Lyft (Private: LYFT ). Ford has joined a self-driving car coalition alongside Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), Lyft and Uber (Private: UBER ). Ford is ramping up its plans for autonomous cars and so is GM. Both are becoming competitive in self-driving cars, with GM planning to renew its line with the Chevrolet Bolt What we're seeing is the opposite of irrational exuberance. It's irrational pessimism. It's an assumption, one that won't give in to evidence, that things are going to heck in a handbasket, as my mother would say. (Tillie would use saltier language.) So here's what I'm going to do. If analysts start pounding the table for these stocks, and if they start to run up, I'm selling the rest of the market. It's not that I don't think the auto makers don't deserve a higher multiple. They do. But a big run at this point will be evidence that the present recovery has run out of ideas, and it's time to batten down the hatches.
