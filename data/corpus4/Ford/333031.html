Ford Motor Priced For A Downturn? Who Cares When You Can Pocket A 5% Dividend - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Analyst downgrades and commentary have hurt Ford last week. A U.S. recession at this point is already priced into shares of Ford Motor. Ford Motor (NYSE: F ) did not get a good start to the year. Investors have been ridding themselves of stocks ever since the new year started, and concerns over a U.S. recession have hurt cyclical auto makers like Ford Motor the hardest. Ford Motor has crashed ~12% since early January, driven by a mix of concerns over the economy in China, the United States, and over the energy price rout that extended into 2016. Adding to, and exacerbating those concerns was a high-profile downgrade and negative commentary about Ford Motor by an investment bank last week that gave investors the jitters. On Wednesday Swiss investment bank Credit Suisse downgraded Ford's stock from 'Neutral' to 'Underperform', and set a price target of $13. Reason for the downgrade: The investment bank argued that the auto maker's volume assumptions are too optimistic, and that recent gains made due to price growth and mix improvements were offset by higher material costs. But that wasn't enough: Investment bank Morgan Stanley piled on the bad news last week and reiterated its 'Sell' rating on Ford Motor due to the risk of a cyclical downturn . Morgan Stanley has a price target of $12 on Ford's stock. There surely is risk of a cyclical downturn, but it is no reason to rush and sell the stock, IMO. In one of my last pieces on the auto maker, " OK, This Is Just Stupid ", I contended that investors are already pricing a U.S. recession into shares of Ford Motor and other U.S. auto manufacturers at this point in time. Ford reported record results for 2015, and announced a special dividend of $1.0 billion in January because the automaker expects momentum to carry forward into 2016. Though the outlook for 2016 does not look too bad, I reduced my price target on Ford Motor's stock to $14 in January because sentiment towards auto companies has unmistakably taken a turn for the worse this year. In a January piece on Ford Motor I concluded: The reason why I am reducing my 12-month price target has therefore nothing to do with Ford's operating results or outlook, but rather with the uphill battle the company will have to fight to overcome negative investor sentiment this year. There is no love for Ford Motor in this market, and a lot of it appears to have to do with expectations that the auto maker is approaching a sales and earnings peak before global auto markets are cooling off. The latest 'Sell' ratings just prove this point; investors are pricing Ford Motor for a recession. Whether Ford, and other auto manufacturers for that matter, have already reached a sales and earnings peak is up for discussion, but the stock is nonetheless a good income and yield play moving forward. The simple question is: What's wrong with buying Ford Motor for a 4.81% yield and holding on to it? Ford declared a special dividend this year, that's true, but even if the automaker decides to return to paying only its regular dividend of $0.60/share in 2017 (assuming no Y/Y dividend growth), an investment in Ford would still yield close to 5%. The risk of a dividend cut is low in my opinion, and collecting regular dividend paychecks from a S&P 500 company during a downturn is not the worst of ideas. Investors already price a cyclical downturn into Ford Motor's shares at this point, so downgrades are to be expected. U.S. economic data so far does not indicate that the U.S. is heading for a recession, which makes it likely that investors are overreacting to downgrades from investment banks. All considered, Ford Motor is an appealing investment choice with low headache potential. The ~5% dividend yield is good enough, at least for me.
