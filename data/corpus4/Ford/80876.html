Ford In India: How The Automaker Plans To Accelerate Its Growth In This Key Market - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha The Indian car market is slated to be worth $150 billion-$200 billion in the coming years, driven by robust GDP growth and availability of credit. Ford holds a market share of just over 2% in India currently as its domestic sales haven't taken off as compared to exports. Ford plans to change the status quo by introducing 4 new models targeting different areas of the Indian market, and has started a road show to promote its latest launch. Ford is strengthening its dealer and service network in India by opening facilities in areas where it does not have a presence yet, thereby improving its brand presence. Ford will invest $700 million in an R&D center in Chennai to bring down costs by reducing dependency on imports and improving localisation levels. The Indian car market holds tremendous potential due to the country's robust GDP growth rate. In 2004, India accounted for just 2% of the world's GDP, but this number is anticipated to increase to 17% by 2050, overtaking the likes of the European Union and Japan, according to a Booz & Co report. The increase in the GDP will increase the discretionary spending power of Indian customers and positively affect car sales. In fact, it is expected that the Indian car market will clock sales of as much as 6 million units by the end of the decade and could generate revenue between $150 billion-$200 billion as shown below: Given the strong potential of this market, it makes sense to take a closer look at how American automaker Ford (NYSE: F ) plans to take advantage of India to improve its financial performance. Ford India's overall performance in 2015 has been better than last year. Ford India has sold a total of 63,341 units this year up to May, up 5% from 60,277 units sold in the same period last year. But, this is largely due to higher export volumes, which are 29.3% higher as compared to last year's 27712 units. In fact, domestic sales this year stand at only 27,516 units as against 32,565 units up to May in 2014, a decline of 15.5%. This is clearly explained in the following charts. Source: Data collected from different news sources As can be seen in the above charts, although the total sales volume in 2015 is better than 2014, the domestic performance has been poor. Also, the month-on-month domestic sales have also depleted. Hence, Ford hasn't performed well in the domestic Indian market in the first half if we take exports out of the equation. In fact, in April, Ford had a market share of only 2.34% in the Indian car market. But, the good thing is that Ford has decided to step on the gas in order to improve its performance in the domestic Indian market by working on a three-point strategy as discussed below. Ford is going to launch 4 new cars this year starting from mid-2015. The first one to be launched will be the Aspire sub-compact sedan, followed by the new, improved Figo hatchback, the Endeavour SUV, and the Mustang. These four models will be catering to different segments of customers, ranging from the budget segment to the premium segment. The Aspire sub-compact will be addressing the C1 segment, which accounts for 15.6% of the Indian car market, and is anticipated to grow at a robust pace due to excise duty benefits and ease of driving in congested city conditions. As a result, Ford is currently engaged in a 10-week long road show known as " What Drives You? " to showcase the Aspire at 40-locations in 25 cities across India, and has bought on board a well-known celebrity to promote it. This should increase the visibility of Ford's upcoming product in the market, and set the stage for more launches going forward. Anurag Mehrotra, executive director Marketing, Sales and Service at Ford India says : "We expect the demand to improve towards last quarter of 2015 and are geared to make the most of this improvement with plans to introduce three new products in the next 12-15 months. Each of these vehicles will delight our customers and set new benchmarks in their segments with their head-turning looks, clever convenience and outstanding fuel efficiency." In my opinion, Ford is bringing its new models into India at an opportune time, as the Reserve Bank of India recently announced a 25 bps cut in the Repo Rate . This will eventually bring down the interest rate on loans and help customers avail more credit. Additionally, a good monsoon season will be another favorable factor since it will keep inflation in check and leave more disposable income with consumers as prices of essential commodities will be kept in check. But, apart from introducing new models, Ford also needs to bolster its dealer and service network. As a result, Ford is strengthening its sales and service network by investing in new facility setups in unexplored territories. For instance, the company has started 2 new sales and service facilities recently, one in Mizoram and one in Punjab . In fact, the sales and service center in Mizoram is its first in the north-eastern region of the country. At present, the company has 341 sales and service facilities in India, covering 186 cities. More importantly, it has been opening new centers at a fast clip, and this will help the company shore up its domestic performance in the long run. New R&D hub at Chennai will act as a cornerstone for upcoming products On the lines of its major competitors, viz. Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai Motor India, Renault-Nissan etc., Ford has decided to invest in a development hub in India. It will be a project worth INR 4,000 to 5,000 crore (around $700 million at the mid-point). Using this R&D hub, Ford is planning to develop a new project known as B500, a mid-size segment sedan to compete with the Honda City in around 2018. Hence, this particular center will yield results in the long run. Moreover, this center will play a key role in bringing down the cost by reducing dependency on imports and improving localisation levels. According to Gaurav Vangaal, senior analyst at IHS Automotive, "Product development cost in India is almost half, if not one-third, when compared to some of the evolved markets." Hence, using this R&D center, Ford will be able to reduce costs at not only its India operations, but on a global basis as well. Ford's performance in the Indian market, excluding exports, isn't that great as the company holds a very small market share. But, with new launches lined up, an expansion of the dealer network in the cards, and a development hub in Chennai expected to come online, Ford is moving in the right direction to tap the long-term growth of the Indian auto market. Since this market is expected to exceed 10 million units in annual sales going forward as explained at the beginning of the article, Ford could see a substantial improvement in its overall financial performance in the long run.
