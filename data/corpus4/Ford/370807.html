General Motors: A Dip In Sales Is Not A Deal Breaker - General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) | Seeking Alpha If there was one automaker that disappointed with its February sales in the United States, it was General Motors (NYSE: GM ). Ford Motor (NYSE: F ), on the other hand, released spectacular February sales figures in America that blew past expectations . Ford's February U.S. sales were up a whopping 20.4 percent Y/Y, significantly outperforming sales expectations. Ford, in fact, single-handedly rebutted the prevailing thesis that automakers are about to face a cyclical decline in sales... at least so far the numbers speak another language. While Ford surprised with strength, General Motors was not doing nearly as well. General Motors said that its auto sales in America declined 1.5 percent Y/Y in February. General Motors sold 227,825 vehicles last month as compared to 231,378 vehicles in February 2015. The drop was due to a near 40 percent decline in rental sales. GM's total 1.5 percent Y/Y decline in auto sales was a disappointment for analysts who expected the automaker to grow sales at a rate of 5.1% Y/Y. General Motors' retail sales were up 6.6 percent Y/Y to 179,958 vehicles. The drop in total sales comes after a very robust start to the year for GM. One of the reasons why automakers have had a difficult standing with investors in 2015/6 was the expectation that they were approaching a sales and earnings peak. Investors therefore went ahead of themselves and priced an earnings recession into shares of auto companies even though auto sales and other economic data so far are not indicating that the U.S. is headed for a recession. In fact, quite the opposite is true: The Bureau of Labor Statistics released its regular jobs report last Friday that showed dynamic job growth in the United States for the month of February. The unemployment rate remained steady at 4.9% while U.S. employers added 242,000 jobs to their payrolls. Presently available economic data sets do not point towards a recession in the United States at this point. As a result, Ford Motor and General Motors retain potential to appreciate in value, especially if sales come in above expectations in 2016. Understanding GM as a yield and income play General Motors has, first and foremost, morphed into an income investment that pays shareholders a nice enough dividend; an investment in GM yields five percent at the time of writing. I consider General Motors' dividend to be safe, even if the auto market in the U.S. takes a breather. General Motors disappointed with its softer-than-expected February sales. GM's sales appeared to be particularly weak when compared against Ford's spectacularly strong sales last month. That said, though, General Motors' retail sales were still up 6.6% Y/Y, and the decline in February sales was at least partly explained by an expected cut in rental sales. GM was off to a good start to the year in January, and deserves the benefit of the doubt. The U.S. economy continues to be in good shape, implying that automakers have more gas in their tank. As far as I am concerned, Ford Motor and General Motors are solid income plays with a low risk of a dividend adjustment. Buy for income. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
