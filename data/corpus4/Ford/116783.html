Ford Should Be Considered As A Long-Term Investment - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Focus on the Asian markets will allow the company to have sustained long-term growth. Ford's plant in India will give it a strategic position to export its cars to the neighboring countries. Toyota Motors will give Ford some serious competition as the company is an incredibly strong player in China and India. Ford (NYSE: F ) has been trying hard to regain its position after the slump of 2008 - the stock took a massive hit with other stocks and had a hard time recovering. However, due to the reinvention efforts and restructuring measures, the company has been able to regain a sustained level of progress in the stock price as well as the core business. Despite these efforts and the growth in business, the stock price has been stagnant over the last two years - the stock price has been moving between $12-15. Ford has been able to increase its market share over the last two years with the help of substantial capital investment, but this growth has failed to translate into a sustained rise in the stock price. The company's strategy to focus on the emerging markets will certainly help it grow in the long term. Ford has production and development in China and India. The company is in the process of designing a new car to cater to the Asian market. As a result of these efforts, more than 60% of the revenue will be generated from the Asian markets over the next five to ten years. Keeping in mind the growth in these markets, this is an astute strategy and it will be a major shift for Ford from its previous strategy. India and China are two of the largest markets for Ford as both these countries are growing at an exceptional rate; disposable income of the consumers is growing which is resulting in a better life standard. Therefore, the demand for luxury goods and imported cars is rising. Ford is also looking to grow its market share in India, and it has been working on it since the past two years. The new investment in Gujarat will be key for Ford. It will serve as an export portal for the vehicles and engines to other markets as well. The major reason for considering India as a major outsourcing hub is due to a number of factors such as good growth, cost efficiency and cheap labor. India's economy has been growing rapidly and Ford is trying to figure out consumer needs and demands so that they can cater to them accordingly. Ford has been quite optimistic regarding Indian growth. It is expected that sales and earnings will start rising in the second half of 2015. Increase in consumer demand as a result of a booming economy with more disposable income is a reason for rising sales. Ford's joint venture with Chong Qing Changan Automobile ( OTC:CQCAF ) is another step towards its long-term growth plan. The takeover and the upgradation of the Chinese factory worth $1.1 billion will increase annual production in China by 200,000 vehicles next year. Ford is doing ample market research for these markets, which is resulting in some models being tailored for a specific market segment. These models might differ in the same region and cater to the needs of the customers in a specific region. One of the key factors in the Asian Markets, especially in India, is the fuel consumption along with the interior features. Customers pay a lot of attention to the fuel economy. Therefore, Ford has had to move away from its typical large vehicles and it is trying to build cars according to the needs of the customers. Ford has continued to endorse its EcoBoost engines as a great way to save on fuel. Its promotion of EcoBoost engines has been very successful. The new Mustang is also causing a stir in these markets as the car has a large fan base worldwide. This car has had a following that does not care about the fuel economy as it has a specific set of fans. However, the new improved fuel economy with the EcoBoost engine, the 2015 Mustang attracts consumers with its impressive technology and features hence targeting different consumer groups. The sales reached the highest point in April 2015 and it is expected that these will be regarded as the best sales of the decade in the next couple of months. Overall, Ford is doing well. The company is following a carefully planned growth strategy that will make it a key player in two of the largest markets in the world. However, it will not be a walk in the park for Ford. Toyota (NYSE: TM ) has an incredibly strong position in both these markets and it will give some stern competition to Ford. Nonetheless, Ford can bring in customers with its wide brand range and cars tailored according to the customer's needs. As these growth plans start to bear fruit, shareholders will start to see a sustained rise in the stock price, in my opinion. Ford should be looked at as a long-term investment.
