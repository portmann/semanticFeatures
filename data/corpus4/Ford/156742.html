This Small Car Will Turn Around Ford's Fortunes In This Emerging Market - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford’s sales in India have declined in the first seven months of the year, which is bad news for investors as India will become the third-biggest global car market. Ford’s market share in India has dropped below 2% as it has not launched any new model for over a year in India. Ford, however, recently launched the Figo Aspire compact sedan, but it is looking to step up its game further with the Figo hatchback. The hatchback market in India accounts for 51% of total sales, and Ford is going all out to target this segment by delivering new features and an updated styling. The Ford Figo is better than rival Suzuki Swift in terms of engine options and power delivery, while it is more frugal as well. Ford's (NYSE: F ) performance in Indian market this calendar year has not been up to the mark. Its sales have declined in each month of the year, both on a sequential basis as well as year-over-year. In fact, at the end of July, Ford's total sales over the first seven months of the year were 23.1% down at 36,477 units. The following chart clearly shows the weakness in Ford's performance in India so far this year: The weakness in Ford's performance in India is not good long-term indicator for the company. This is because India's auto market is growing at a rapid pace, and it is expected to rank among the top three in terms of sales by 2030. The following chart shows the potential of India's auto market: Also, as seen in the above chart, the revenue potential of the Indian car market is expected to be in the range of $150 billion to $200 billion. This indicates that the opportunity present in the Indian market is quite strong, but Ford has been unable to make any headway into this market as it has a market share of only 1.99% in the country. Moreover, the reason behind Ford's weak performance in India so far this year can be attributed to the lack of new models. In fact, the company didn't launch any new model in India in the first seven months of the year before coming out with the Ford Figo Aspire sub-compact sedan this month. With this launch, things could change for the better for Ford as it is now able to target the fast-growing compact sedan segment in the country. Moreover, going forward, Ford's next launch will also play a crucial role in driving the company's sales in the country. The four new vehicles that Ford India has lined up for launch this year are the new-gen Figo Hatchback, the Figo Aspire, the Endeavour SUV, and the Ford Mustang. As mentioned above, the Ford Aspire has already been launched this month. The company will now focus on the new-gen Figo Hatchback. This new model was previewed in India as the Ford Ka Concept at the 2014 Delhi Motor Show, and Ford will be launching this model just before the busy Diwali season when car sales in India remain strong. Thus, Ford seems to have timed the launch of this new model quite smartly, and I believe that a strong feature list of the model will play a key role in the model's sales going forward. I'm saying this because the Figo is already one of the most popular hatchbacks sold by the American car maker in India and was Ford's best-selling vehicle until the company phased it out to prepare for a new model. This car has been specifically-developed for developing countries to give the customers the feel of a big car at an affordable price. The new Ford Figo is expected to retain the strengths of the outgoing model - build quality, fuel efficiency, and affordable pricing - apart from carrying an updated list of features. Ford has updated the styling of the new Figo based on its global design language. It now carries the hexagonal grille similar to the Aston Martins, and this will play a key role in the car's sales in India as looks play an important factor. Moreover, the next-generation Figo also looks bigger than the outgoing Figo hatchback due to a larger wheelbase, which means that it will be roomier on the inside and more comfortable. Moreover, the interior design of the Figo hatchback is similar to that of the EcoSport and the Fiesta in terms of both layout and overall design. The higher end diesel and petrol variants will be loaded with equipment such as Ford's 4.2 inch SYNC music system, auto-folding ORVMs, reversing sensors with camera, rain sensing wipers, and auto dimming internal mirror. Additionally, the steering wheel will be mounted with control switches. Thus, Ford is going all-out in terms of styling and features in order to make the most of the opportunity present in the hatchback segment in India. This is a smart move by Ford, as the small car segment in India accounts for around 51% of overall sales. Additionally, in order to steal a march over its peers, Ford has given the Figo a strong engine line-up that will help it take market share away from existing players. The engine options in the new Figo hatchback will be the same as those available in the Figo Aspire. There will be 3 options . The first will be a 1.2-liter Ti-VCT 4-cylinder petrol engine that will generate 88bhp of power and 112 Nm of peak torque. The second will be a 1.5-liter TDCi 4-cylinder diesel engine that will produce 100PS of power and 215Nm of torque. The last one will be a 1.5-liter Ti-VCT petrol with a 6-Speed auto transmission that will produce 112bhp of power and peak torque of 136Nm. In comparison, the Figo's prime competitor, the Maruti Suzuki Swift, comes with just two engine options and no automatic transmission. The diesel-powered Swift generates just 74bhp of power and 190Nm of torque, while the petrol-powered Swift generates 84Bhp of power and 115Nm of torque. Hence, Ford has done the right thing by offering the Figo with more engine options, higher power, and an automatic transmission, and these should help the company attract more customers. Finally, all 3 engines are quite fuel-efficient as well. The 1.2 litre petrol is rated to give a mileage of 18.2 kilometres per litre, which is higher than the Swift petrol. Meanwhile, for the diesel, the company claims a mileage of 25.83 kilometres per litre for the 1.5-liter diesel version, which is again higher than the Swift. Thus, it is clearly evident that Ford has got the right product to tap a segment that's fast-expected to grow in India. Ford expects the industry sales of compact cars in India to climb to 780,000 units by 2020 from 448,000 units in 2015. Thus, Ford is targeting the right segment to improve its sales performance in India. Moreover, with two new cars in its portfolio, I think that the company will now be able to arrest the decline in its sales in the country. As such, I'm confident that Ford's fortunes in India will soon turnaround and the company will be able to tap a fast-growing auto market quite successfully.
