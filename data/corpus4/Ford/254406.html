Restructuring My Ford Motor Investment And Moving Back Into The Common Stock For Yield - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford Motor released U.S. November sales on Tuesday. Ford's sales release was defined by growing average transaction prices and strong SUV demand. What a year for Ford Motor (NYSE: F ): The auto company has had one of the best sales years in a decade and saw its new F-150 aluminum-bodied truck fly off the lots, yet investors still refuse to reward the company for its performance with a higher share price. Sometimes the stock market is weird...Ford's stock has done nothing for investors this year: Shares are down 6% year-to-date. Even when factoring in the company's dividend, investors didn't make it into the black this year. Ford's disappointing performance -- in terms of stock performance, that is -- has led me to reduce my return expectations for Ford's stock in November. I have a 12-month price target of $17 on Ford Motor's stock, and have now restructured my investment in the auto company. While I previously held a warrant position with a strike price of $17 and an expiry date of January 2017, I have now swapped the warrants for the common stock. Why? Simple: Because I have to consider the option's time value, and because investors don't have much love for the auto company right now. As a result, it made sense for me to de-risk my portfolio and buy the common stock in order to be able to pocket at least a 4% dividend. Does anybody really care about Ford's November sales? I don't think so... My long-term outlook on Ford Motor is bullish, though, simply because the company continues to grow sales. At the end of the day, that's all that matters: If customers like your products they will buy them, and will also come back later for follow-up purchases. Ford's November sales, for instance, which the company released on Tuesday, showed that the auto maker is on the right track. While total U.S. November sales were up 'only' 0.4% Y/Y, Ford's management nonetheless could present sales figures with its head held high. In November Ford Motor sold 187,794 vehicles as compared to 187,000 vehicles a year ago. Year-to-date, Ford Motor has now sold 2,373,920 vehicles, which is 5% more than in the same period last year. In the first eleven months of 2014 Ford Motor sold 2,260,271 vehicles. Trucks continued to do well for Ford with 83,912 vehicles being sold last month, which was ~18% more than a year ago. While Ford Motor's overall sales growth has leveled off in November, F-series retail sales continued to surge. Robust demand for SUVs and trucks also translate into rising average transaction prices thanks to Ford's product mix improvements. According to Ford Motor's latest press release : Ford's lower incentive spending and strong model series mix in November boosted average transaction prices $3,800 versus year-ago levels - the largest gain among any major automaker. Ford cars, SUVs and trucks all delivered higher transaction prices. Though Ford's investors have every reason to be optimistic, I expect the stock to chug along with the market, with neither significant upside or downside. With the common stock replacing the warrants in my portfolio, however, the 4% dividend is nothing to scoff at. Ford Motor is in a good position to continue to grow sales in the United States: Customers clearly love Ford's cars (otherwise F-Series retail sales wouldn't continue to surge) and selling higher-priced cars will translate into margin improvements, and, hence, higher earnings in 2016. Further, Ford Motor's stock affords investors with a high margin of safety since it sells for less than eight times earnings. It is probably best to see Ford Motor for what it really is: A growing auto behemoth whose stock produces a nice amount of dependable income. Ford Motor is a compelling dividend stock with a low degree of investment risk. Buy for income. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
