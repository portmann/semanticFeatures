Does GM's Strength Point To An Earnings Beat For Ford? - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha With less than a week to go before Ford reports earnings, the company is gaining momentum. If GM is any example, we can expect to see Ford easily beat market expectations. Some recent developments may affect forward outlook. Average analyst estimates are low and have not been significantly revised following a wave of positive sales news. There are clear signs the U.S. automakers are gaining momentum. Less than a month ago, the industry reported record-breaking sales, well above expectations, with positive forward outlook. Sales in September, let me remind you, topped 18 million on an annualized basis and were better than 16% higher than last year at this time. Today, GM (NYSE: GM ) reported earnings far beyond analysts' expectations and may be foreshadowing similar strength in Ford (NYSE: F ). GM just reported and reported strong, as indicated by sales figures. The surprise is in just how strong the company reported. Despite a net loss attributable to shareholders of $1.5 billion ($0.66 per share) due to recalls and civil actions stemming from recall/ignition switch issues, the company reported adjusted earnings of $1.50. This beats consensus estimates by $0.31, 26%, and 55% better than last year's Q3 earnings, bringing the year-to-date total to +96% over 2014. GM's performance is mostly due to strength in the U.S. U.S. EBIT topped $3.16 billion, offset by small losses in Europe and South America. In terms of foreign exchange, the company did report a negative impact. Total revenues were negatively impacted by -$2.3 billion, enough to cause concern but not enough to keep the stock from popping more than 6% on the news, breaking above resistance and hitting a four-month high. The company execs had some good thing to say about the results, the state of the turnaround and their expectations into the future. GM CEO Mary Barra "These results reflect our work to capitalize on our strengths in the U.S. and China, while taking decisive, proactive steps to mitigate challenges elsewhere, GM is a vastly different company today than just five years ago. We're building a strong foundation, driving earnings growth in our core business and executing a plan to lead the future of personal mobility, all with the aim of creating shareholder value for years to come." Chuck Stevens, GM executive vice president and chief financial officer went on to add... "We expect our earnings to accelerate in the next several years, with double-digit earnings per share growth." All of this is a preamble to Ford's scheduled earnings release on 10/27. I have already gone over my expectations for Ford's earnings in my article, Ford Is Going To $17 , so I won't rehash that here. Let it suffice to say that sales trends and earnings projections are not in sink. Data shows the company is performing much better than expected, as is the broader auto market, and on track to beat consensus estimates and report at or above the high end of the range. And the analysts say... consensus estimate is near $0.47 per share for the current quarter. Low-end estimates are closer to $0.41 while the high end is $0.54. Outlook for next quarter is good; consensus estimate jumps a nickel to $0.52 although the range of estimates widens. Low estimate is $0.40 with high estimate $0.64. Over the last week, in the face of all this great news for Ford, no analyst has raised their forecast for the current quarter. Only one has raised their forecast for next quarter. In the last thirty days, two have raised forecast for the current quarter and five have raised for the next quarter, a little better, but offset by downward revisions for both quarters. Four analysts have lowered their estimates for the current-quarter earnings while three have lowered their forecast for the next quarter, altogether providing plenty of opportunity for upward revisions and/or upside earnings surprises this quarter and next. A couple of new news items and company developments have occurred over the last week that may impact earnings estimates and forward outlook. First, a new report from the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association shows that auto registrations are up 8.1% in September and 9.8% for the year-to-date period, yet another sign of increasing momentum in the EU automobile market. Ford's YTD registrations are up 7%. The caveat is that market share slipped by a tenth to 7.9%. However, despite the slip in market share, it is clear that the company is performing well in Europe, and progressing in its long-term plan to turn around operations in that region. Just last week, Ford reported that sales in the EU were up 8% in September, led by commercial vehicles' 12% increase. Overall, the registrations data is a major plus for Ford and raises the chance for earnings to be beat expectations. Another development is a recall in China. The joint venture Changan Ford Automobiles recalled 220K vehicles over concern the fuel tanks may leak after use. The recall is a concern, but its cost will be a drop in the bucket compared to the $1.8 billion Ford plans to spend on R&D in China. Perhaps of more immediate concern are some changes in management. The first, a change in legal counsel, is not material to the company's performance. Two others, VPs of manufacturing in Asia and the EU, may be of more concern. Linda Cash replaces Jeff Wood, who is retiring, in the EU. Bill Russo will replace Gary Johnson in Asia, who is being recalled to head up a special project. Both changes are in-house promotions and expected to help with the integration of new technologies and cost-saving measures into their respective programs. So, some new developments, and two things to be wary of; declining market share in the EU and the recall in China. However, the two negatives are minor worries compared to the aggregate positive impact of increasing momentum in the EU marketplace, investment in R&D and new management with the experience to extend Ford's global turnaround. Net impact of new developments is definitely positive in my book. I thought my previous estimate was low, but recent developments have made me rethink it; Ford is more of a buy than ever. The company is undervalued relative to its earnings potential and riding a strong wave of growth, with positive outlook for continued growth into the next 12-18 months. On a P/E basis alone, we could expect to see Ford gain as much as 25%. Trailing P/E is near 13 times earnings, low compared to broader market, but high compared to forward P/E. On a forward basis, P/E is closer to 9 times earnings, giving a target near $20. If Ford beats earnings as I suspect, and is able to carry momentum into next year as projected, it could easily go higher. Average analyst price target is just $17.88 with a high estimate of $23, providing a 20-30% window of opportunity for investors over the next year. Oh, and I forgot to mention the company's dividend yield is near 4% at today's prices. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
