Ford's July Provides A Nice Surprise - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford saw a 4.9% increase in US auto sales in July 2015 compared to July 2014 as the new F-150 aluminum-bodied model continued to see tight supply levels. The Ford Mustang saw the strongest July sales since 2008. With Ford expecting to reach full inventory levels next month, its turnaround remains on track to take advantage of the growing US auto industry in the remainder of 2015. Ford (NYSE: F ) announced July 2015 US vehicle sales of 223K, up 4.9% from the same month in 2014. This 4.9% increase surprised analysts as it came in well above the 1.8% increase estimated. Ford's 4.9% year-over-year increase came amidst an overall US auto sales industry that is crushing prior year with an industry-wide growth of 5.3%. With the low interest rates and cheaper fuel prices to be credited, analysts are expecting 2015 sales to be 17.1 million with the annualized sales rate at 17.55 million. If the annualized sales rate keeps pace and 17.55 million is reached, it would mark the best year for the industry since 2000. If the analysts are right and the rate falls to 17.1 million, it would match the sales from 2001 prior to the recession. Even with the record setting July, Ford believes a strong second half is coming as the new aluminum-bodied F-150 pickup is reaching full production levels for the first time all year. Based on this, I believe Ford July keeps the company on track to a lagging recovery. The Ford F-150 production is continuing to catch up to demand as the plants reached full production levels in July. The Ford F-150, which underwent a drastic model change to an aluminum body starting with this year's model, has seen tight inventory levels so far as the company has worked to configure their manufacturing plants. Because of the inventory constraints surrounding the new F-150 model, the company has not utilized heavy incentives to sell older models like competitors. Because of this, the F-150 saw another record setting average transaction price during July 2015 with an all-time transaction price up $3,200 versus a year ago. Additionally, the new F-150 is seeing positive consumer reactions when it makes it to the customer lot with a quick turnover time. According to management, the new F-150 is turning twice as fast on dealer lots than the industry average for half-ton pickups. This turnover time bodes well for the company going forward as management said the company only had half of their normal inventory levels on dealer lots in through the midpoint of 2015. This is very encouraging for a company expecting to reach full capacity of its bestselling product next month. Based on these results keeping the company on track for a major turnaround, I continue to be optimistic of Ford's future because I think it is important for Ford to get this product launch right as the company is taking the F-series brand in a new direction designed for better fuel mileage. With optimal inventory levels imminent, I think it's important to look at the quick turnover time of the model and the very strong US auto market. Both of these indicators are signs of a positive finish to 2015 for the F-150 and Ford as a whole. In July 2015, the US auto consumer continued the shift back to less fuel-efficient vehicles in response to the falling fuel prices. This shift in consumer sentiment will boost sales for the company's higher profit margin vehicles such as the F-150, Explorer, and Expedition. The Mustang saw another impressive month in July, consistent with early 2015 results. Mustang sales were at their highest July level since 2008 and continue to build its case to reclaim the title of bestselling muscle car in 2015. This is a title the company has not held since before the 2010 Chevrolet Camaro was introduced. During July, Mustang sales were up a whopping 51% with nearly 77,000 Mustangs sold year-to-date in 2015 compared to only nearly 51,000 year-to-date in 2015. I believe this is the resurgence of the Mustang and should provide long-term growth for the company in the reclaimed segment. While the turnaround looks likely, there are certainly that I believe could derail the company's momentum. These include the overall health of the US economy, labor negotiations, and emergence of new competitors in the auto industry. If there was an event or condition that forced the US economy back into slowing growth territory, it would definitely have a major impact on Ford especially given their lag on inventory levels. Additionally, labor negotiations with UAW are key to Ford's bottom line as it employs more than 52,000 US UAW hourly employees . It is important that management keeps these costs under control and does not let costs get out of control. Finally, with new companies working to produce technology infused vehicles such as Tesla, Google, and Apple, it is important that Ford stays ahead of this curve and doesn't fall behind when it comes to technology use in the vehicle. Management should not be looking at the industry as theirs to lose, but they should rather be seeing it as an opportunity to lead the way. It's no secret that Ford is losing ground to competitors due to the inventory restrictions as most consumers purchase a vehicle when needed instead of waiting for the newest model. Because of this and other factors, the Ford turnaround is not a sure thing. However, this is not the big picture an investor should be seeing when buying shares of Ford. They should be seeing management's plan to shorten the company's normal summer shutdown in order to increase production. This shows me as an investor the new F-150's results are positive and the high end models are selling well, which is creating a lot of optimism around the new model going forward. Once full production capacity is reached, I fully expect Ford to start leading the pack. Given this long-term optimism with Ford, I am encouraged by the US sales results in July. I continue to be excited about the company's future as the new aluminum bodied F-150 is nearing full production levels, the recent shift in consumer sentiment to higher profit margin vehicles, and the strong sales of the Mustang. With consumers purchasing more expensive vehicles, it will allow Ford to report stronger top line and bottom line growth in the end of 2015. I remain bullish on the US automobile industry and believe Ford has a strong product mix to take advantage of the growing market. I will continue to enjoy the near 4% dividend yield as the company prepares to be successful in the long-term.
