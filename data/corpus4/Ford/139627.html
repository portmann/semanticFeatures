Small-Cap Shale Producer's Profit At Almost Every Price Scenario - Carrizo Oil & Gas, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRZO) | Seeking Alpha Carrizo's breakeven price in the Eagle Ford is estimated at $42 a barrel. The model implies a specific range for Carrizo's overall breakeven price. On Monday, Seeking Alpha published an article suggesting that one of the strongest, largest (by market cap) shale producers was not likely to grow production at current commodity price levels. Through this analysis, I also came across Carrizo Oil & Gas (NASDAQ: CRZO ), which I noticed as it is operating very near the highly-profiled companies in the Eagle Ford, EOG Resources (NYSE: EOG ) and Chesapeake Energy (NYSE: CHK ). Although conventional wisdom has been decreeing that the small-scale producers will be left to rot in the downturn of the commodity cycle, I was intrigued enough by the company's strong acreage and production to calculate just how well it can manage through the low-price storm. First and foremost, it is worth noting that Carrizo possesses drilling rights to 82,500 Net Acres in the Eagle Ford, 20,000 Net Acres in the Wolfcamp, 32,000 Net Acres in the Marcellus Shale, 27,500 Net Acres in the Utica, and 34,700 Net Acres in the Niobrara. The company's acreage accounts for the majority of its proven reserves, with its 123.88 MMBOE (Million barrels of oil equivalent) trumping all of its other plays combined. What makes this so valuable is that the Eagle Ford is also the company's most economical play, with an average breakeven cost of $42 a barrel (WTI). Unfortunately, Carrizo's costs (which fell 10% for drilling in Q1 and 20% for completions in the same period) are not consistent throughout each of its operations, meaning to find an accurate breakeven price, a full-scale model would have to be developed. Before examining this model, we must first illuminate the economics of individual plays and the company's debt (after all, this is what is supposed to be crushing the small caps, isn't it?). As aforementioned, Carrizo's Eagle Ford assets are its bread and butter, as 43 MMBOE of the company's proved, developed reserves of its 66.8 MMBOE comes from this one play. With its assets in Gardendale maintaining a breakeven cost of $33.75 per barrel, and with over 80% of its locations in the area boasting a breakeven cost of $43 a barrel or less (according to the company's latest Investor Presentation), the Eagle Ford play remains the most economical and conducive to both medium and long-term growth. Carrizo estimates it has proved, undeveloped reserves of 80.8 MMBOE and probable reserves of 269.5 MMBOE in the basin. Should the company report production numbers for Q2 that far exceed its guidance, I expect the Eagle Ford to have been the catalyst, as would have shone through even the near 52-week lows in oil prices. In the Niobrara, the company's reported average breakeven cost is $52 a barrel, but a concern here is that approximately 9% of its locations have a breakeven cost estimated at $86.72 a barrel. Although overall, the company has a considerably low breakeven cost for the play as a whole, its high range suggests that production growth is increasingly unlikely (and unprofitable) at current levels. Growth may manifest itself over the long term in the Delaware Basin, where the company plans to test its acreage this year and then manage its option to acquire an additional 2,800 Net Acres accordingly. This should be particularly encouraging for investors, because while other companies are struggling to maintain current plays, Carrizo sticks to a forward-looking vision while staking out new plays. Now, future growth (assuming higher oil prices) and low breakeven costs in its primary play certainly sound attractive, but one would imagine that this level of activity would result in excessive debt - debt that would be excessively difficult to pay off amid low commodity prices. Surely, Carrizo is not debt-free, but the company has no borrowings due until 2018 - $685 million, about a third of Carrizo's total debt - with another third of its debt being due in 2020, and the rest in 2023. As the company holds no near-term debt, the price declines can be managed appropriately, without the fear of a bankruptcy (as analysts have argued is the fate of many small-cap producers). Still, in order to justify any investment in Carrizo, an investor needs to examine how the company is set to perform at every oil price level. To calculate this, I created the following model based on expense data provided by the company to investors: Before drawing any conclusions, one must recognize that the listed Nat Gas and Crude Prices represent realized prices for the company, which were 84.6% and 88.9% of NYMEX prices in Q1, respectively. I did this to consolidate for the omittance of hedging effects in the model; to calculate unrealized prices and their effects on Net Profit, one simply needs to multiply the listed oil price by 1.09 (assuming the low-end range of the company's Q2 guidance, in the worst-case scenario) and the natural gas price by 1.28 (also using the low-end of the company's guidance for realized prices). All expenses take the high-end of the company's guidance, and all production numbers used the low-end of the company's guidance. While this seems very unlikely, as costs fell within Carrizo's guidance last quarter and production exceed the high-end of guidance (as a result of robust Eagle Ford output), it was done to provide investors with a margin of safety and knowledge of the numbers in the case of a worst-case scenario. Although I discounted the effects of hedging, Carrizo has secured itself well for the rest of the year, as it has collars on about 15,800 barrels a day, with approximately $67 ceilings and $50 floors ( Q1 Earnings Call ). The effects of hedging have been omitted from the model to give an investor an idea of how its assets perform at every oil price without this benefit; nonetheless, the hedges are a positive that add value to the company that will be addressed later on. All profits and expenses represent full-year fiscal 2015 numbers. One final note on the model is that every 10% increase in natural gas prices corresponds to a 10% increase in oil prices; although this type of commodity price correlation is very unlikely, it provides for the best insight into how the company performs at various levels when the movements are uniform with each other. Examining the above chart gives a pretty clear idea about what level of oil and natural gas prices the company needs, in aggregate, to generate a positive cash flow: between $2.42 per MMBTU (natural gas realized prices) and $2.66 for natural gas, and between $48.40 and $53.24 for WTI oil. My calculations (using the low-end guidance of probable price realizations converted to unrealized prices) suggest that Carrizo needs $56.68 per barrel prices for oil and $3.2 per MMBTU for natural gas to turn a profit, in the most pessimistic scenario for realizations, production numbers, and expenses, all before the impact of hedges. After we observe the impact of hedges, which management has placed in a disciplined fashion, we see that Carrizo Oil and Gas has a net breakeven price closer to $50 a barrel, if we still take the low-end of management's production guidance and high-end of expenses guidance. As we only are seeing oil move below $50 a barrel this past week for the first time in months, I am confident that the company is currently well positioned to manage oil price volatility. A final calculation I found intriguing is using the Net Profit at $64.42 realized oil prices of over $107 million for full-year 2015 to calculate an earnings multiple; currently with a market cap of $1.962 billion, assuming 2015 Net Profit of $107,953,307.26 yields a P/E ratio of about 18 for 2015. Given that this discounts hedges and takes into account the worst of management's forecast for the rest of the year, and considering the amount of growth left in the Eagle Ford (and perhaps continued cost reductions) and even the Delaware Basin, this makes the company appear very attractively valued for investors expecting oil to recover to above $60 a barrel. As the model shows, however, if WTI continues to trade at the $45-47 a barrel level, Carrizo will struggle immensely to turn a profit, but will not face serious financial troubles unless the downturn becomes persistent over an extended period of time.
