Quarterly Update On HDLV: Ford Cruises In - UBS ETRACS Monthly Pay 2xLeveraged US High Dividend Low Volatility ETN (NYSEARCA:HDLV) | Seeking Alpha  |  About: UBS ETRACS Monthly Pay 2xLeveraged US High Dividend Low Volatility ETN (HDLV) , Includes: BDCL , CEFL , CME , DUK , DVHL , DVYL , F , HCN , HCP , HOMX , IP , MORL , PM , SO , SPLV , T , USMV , VTR , VZ , WY HDLV performed its quarterly rebalance in January. A new 10% allocation to Ford is a surprising, but not altogether unwelcome, development. Don't look now, but the ETRACS 2x US High Dividend Low Volatility ETN (NYSEARCA: HDLV ) has been cruising past its competition. Over the past 1-year, HDLV has returned 26.24%, or 13.12% when adjusted to 1x leverage. In comparison, the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA: SPY ) has returned only 1.20%. HDLV has also raced ahead of two well-known low-volatility ETFs, including the iShares MSCI USA Minimum Volatility ETF (NYSEARCA: USMV ), this year's most popular stock ETF, and the PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility ETF (NYSEARCA: SPLV ), which have both returned about 9% in the past year. Unfortunately, despite its great performance, HDLV still doesn't have a significant follower base on Seeking Alpha. At the time of writing, only 363 people have HDLV in their portfolio, compared to 1,957 for USMV and 4,496 for SPLV. HDLV Total Return Price data by YCharts In terms of the ETRACS 2x ETN line-up, HDLV has also been far and away the best performer with its 27.03% total return. Coming a distant second is the Monthly Pay 2xLeveraged Dow Jones Select Dividend ETN (NYSEARCA: DVYL ) at 12.15%. At the bottom end of this league table are the Monthly Pay 2xLeveraged Closed-End Fund ETN (NYSEARCA: CEFL ), the Monthly Pay 2XLeveraged Mortgage REIT ETN (NYSEARCA: MORL ), the 2X Leveraged Long Wells Fargo Business Development Company ETN (NYSEARCA: BDCL ), the 2xLeveraged Diversified High Income ETN (NYSEARCA: DVHL ) and the ETRACS ISE Exclusively Homebuilders ETN (NYSEARCA: HOMX ), which have returned between -17.1% and -19.5% over this past year. As mentioned in my previous articles , the top-heavy nature of HDLV means that the additions or deletions that take place during quarterly rebalancing can have a big impact on the characteristics of the portfolio. The big story for this quarter's rebalance was the addition of the Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F ), which because of its large market capitalization instantly entered with the largest allowable weighting of 10%, tied with Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) and AT&T (NYSE: T ). The Top 10 holdings of HDLV account for 64.47% of the fund. As a companies in the consumer cyclical sector, Ford is not one of the stocks that instantly spring to mind when one thinks of high dividend, low volatility stocks. However, pulling up a one-year chart of F reveals that its yield spiked to above 5% in January (that's not even counting its special dividend of $0.40) per share) as its share price declined. Now, obviously HDLV being based on a passive index does not make active decisions, but one can't help but notice what good timing the fund had in buying into Ford this quarter. Since the rebalancing date on Jan. 15, 2016, the total return of F (14.77%) has been nearly double that of SPY (7.96%). F Total Return Price data by YCharts The rest of the Top 10 are filled with the usual blue-chip cash-generating dividend machines, including the trifecta of healthcare REITs, HCN, VTR and HCP. Pleasingly, VTR has re-entered the fund after being removed (for reasons that I could not ascertain) last quarter. Two of the previous stocks in the Top 10, PPL and WY, have disappeared from this quarter's portfolio. CME is no longer in the Top 10 but it remains in 12th place, with a 3.26% weighting. A new addition to the Top 10 is International Paper Company, at 10th place with a 3.39% weighting. IP has a very impressive recent dividend record, having increased its distribution by at least 10% for the last 5 years (though it was forced to cut during the financial crisis). It currently yields 4.41%. HDLV has now paid out 17 monthly dividends. Its most recent 5 months of dividends summed to $1.17, which is 16% higher than the comparable period a year ago. Note that because HDLV is an ETN, it acts as a "pass-through" type security in that all distributions received by the fund will be passed on to unitholders rather than being accrued in the fund's NAV. This means that the distributions will be somewhat lumpy from month to month. HDLV's trailing 12-month yield is 9.49%. Dividing that number by two gives 4.75%, which may be useful if one wants to compare the yield of HDLV with other unleveraged funds. HDLV contains to churn out high levels of monthly cash to its unitholders. As a nice bonus, the total return of HDLV over the past one year has also been very pleasing, bettering both the broad market and other low-volatility ETFs. The highly concentrated nature of HDLV's portfolio is a double-edged sword. With VZ and T both being top weights, you instantly have 20% of the portfolio allocated to telecommunications. On the other hand, one may take comfort in the fact that the fund is overweight in such types of "grandma stocks". I also like the fact that there are three healthcare REITs in the Top 10 (totaling 12% of the fund's weight) as these should continue to enjoyable favorable demographic headwinds in the years to come. The addition of Ford is not something I'm so sure that I'm 100% pleased with. Obviously, the recent rebound in F's shares has been a boon to HDLV's unit price, but if the market suddenly anticipates a slowing economy then F will not likely escape unscathed. Both bull and bear cases have been recently articulated on Seeking Alpha, and it will be interesting to see how long F remains in this high-dividend low-volatility fund.
