Capital Return Review: Ford Motor Company - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford is seeing strong sales numbers but still carriers a low valuation. Shares carry a sizeable 4.2% dividend yield. With auto sales going strong, major automakers are returning capital to shareholders through multiple avenues. In a previous article I discussed the capital return plans from General Motors (NYSE: GM ) and here I will discuss the plans from Ford (NYSE: F ). Auto investors are well aware of Ford's position as the only member of the Detroit Three not to go through reorganization during the financial crisis. But prior to the crisis, the automaker took action to revamp itself including selling off Volvo, Land Rover, and Jaguar to raise cash. Ford also has the best-selling pickup truck in the U.S., the Ford F-150 (however sales of the F-150 lag the combined sales of the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra). For the 2015 model year, the F-150 gained an aluminum body helping to shave off weight boosting performance and fuel economy. While there have been some concerns over the move to aluminum, Ford's August sales numbers looked encouraging for the F-150 remodel. Alongside its automotive side, Ford also has a financial side, Ford Motor Credit, that extends credit to Ford buyers. Worth noting is that this part carries the vast majority of Ford's total debt with much of it being backed by vehicles themselves. This makes for a significantly safer investment than its debt to equity ratio would imply. Unlike GM with its $5 billion share buyback, Ford has not launched a stock buyback to reduce outstanding shares. Last year Ford launched and completed a $1.8 billion share buyback however this was only to balance out dilution from share based compensation and convertible notes. In its 2014 annual report Ford noted that it had completed the buyback and gave no indication of launching a new buyback. While Ford has mostly avoided share buybacks in recent years, it has made major efforts to return capital to shareholders via dividends. Currently the quarterly $0.15 per share dividend gives the automaker a yield of 4.3%. This puts its yield slightly below GM's but above almost all of the rest of the automotive industry. Ford has also developed a pattern of raising its dividend by $0.025 per quarter at the beginning of each year. With a current payout ratio of 58.3, the dividend is met at this point but earnings growth from the company would go a long way towards making it appear more sustainable. This payout ratio also implies that Ford will need strong earnings growth to safely increase its dividend. Trading at only 8.4x est. 2015 earnings and 7.4x est. 2016 earnings, Ford shares carry a low valuation. Largely because of this I would like to see management implement a stock buyback program, even if it is not as large as GM's program. But investors should be aware that GM only launched its $5 billion buyback after being pressured by activist investors. Similar action is less likely to be successful at Ford due to the power of the Ford family in the voting structure. Although I would like the company to add a buyback, the dividend still makes the capital return plan a positive one overall. Fortunately for investors, significant earnings growth is expected with EPS expected to more than double from 2014 to 2015. If this earnings growth materializes, it should allow the company to both raise its dividend and bring its payout ratio down to a safer level. Some investors have also argued that Ford should pursue debt reduction. While I do believe that less debt could earn the stock a higher valuation, I also believe the company should be selective in which debt it targets. High interest debt is worth eliminating but the company has better uses for cash than eliminating low interest debt. It's also important to note that since shares have a 4.2% dividend yield, Ford could reduce ongoing cash commitments by repurchasing shares. Despite the low current valuation and large dividend, Ford shares continue to remain volatile and this will likely keep happening as broader market turbulence continues. Ford's exposure to the cyclical auto industry could impact its ability to pay/grow dividends in the future so investors should be willing to assume some risk before adding Ford to their portfolio. Ford has focused almost exclusively on dividends over buybacks making it better positioned for income investors. However, the lack of a buyback misses an opportunity for management to reduce the share count at this valuation as well as saving on dividends from having fewer outstanding dividend paying shares. Despite the lack of a buyback, Ford is still a worthwhile investment for dividend value investors to consider in my opinion.
