Ford Motor: OK, This Is Just Stupid - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I am/we are long F. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. Ford Motor announced a $0.25/share special dividend on Tuesday. Ford's cash flow yield spiked to ~7% as a result, yet investors would have none of it. I discuss three reasons why I think investors avoid Ford Motor. My Ford Motor (NYSE: F ) articles in 2015 have centered around two themes, really. Theme number one related to Ford's reports of inspiring sales growth in the United States, theme number two dished on Ford Motor's objective undervaluation on a price-to-earnings and price-to-sales basis. But those things didn't really matter in 2015: Ford's valuation wouldn't move up no matter how good results were. In fact, quite the opposite was true: Ford's stock slipped all throughout the year. Watching the show unfold was as frustrating as it could be. 2016 is not shaping up to be a better year for Ford either. Why would I make such a statement just two weeks into the new year? Because Ford declared a $1 billion special dividend, or $0.25 per share on Tuesday, and guess what happened to the stock? Yes, it went down. By a lot. On Wednesday, Ford Motor slipped 5% and ended the day at $12.20. What's going on here? Why would a stock go down in value, and by that much, when MORE cash is coming shareholders' way? Granted, the market was weak, oil continues to fall (which is actually a positive factor for Ford Motor since it spurs sales of SUVs and pickups because lower gas prices encourage the purchase of bigger vehicles), and China is not getting back into shape either. Even with the stock market heading south, though, you'd expect Ford Motor's stock to at least hold its ground in light of such a positive announcement, right? Wrong. Investors seem to take every opportunity to clobber Ford, even though the auto company just gave investors a healthy raise. How many investment grade-rated S&P 500 companies do you know that yield ~7%? Not many, I suppose. Because there aren't any. As we all know, Ford is doing well in the U.S. But don't make the mistake and think the United States is the only place that's doing great for Ford. China is also seeing some robust sales growth. Just last week Ford said that it has sold more than 1.1 million vehicles in 2015, a new annual sales record, in the world's second largest economy, and it finished the year strong with a 27% Y/Y sales growth in December. Europe? Ford's new vehicle sales in Europe increased 11% in 2015, outpacing industry growth of 9%. So, what's the issue here? If Ford's business is objectively in good shape nearly everywhere, and the company guided for 2016 profits that are expected to be at least as high as they were in 2015, why do investors not want to own the stock? There are no clear-cut answers, of course, but I can share my suspicions as to why Ford Motor is so cheap. 1. Since 2009 stocks have been going up, with a few minor corrections here and there. The economy has also gained ground steadily and unemployment is now back down to 5%. But every bull market will come to an end at some point. I feel that a lot of investors are concerned over how long auto companies can continue their awesome run before they run out of steam. Any economic slowdown will, first and foremost, hit cyclical companies like Ford Motor the hardest. 2. Another reason I can see why investors shy away from buying Ford is that General Motors (NYSE: GM ) is even cheaper than Ford, and has been a hedge fund darling, thereby deflecting attention, and capital, away from Ford. 3. Further yet, concerns over the depth of the economic slowdown in China, where volume and market share gains for Western auto companies have been significant as of late, have sort of hurt the bullish thesis for Ford Motor. But even when taking such factors into consideration, the risks of a recession are priced into Ford's shares. Therefore, the point remains that Ford Motor is nothing but a bargain at $12...if you are an income investor and are in it for the long haul. There are reasons to like Ford Motor, and there are arguments to be made against buying cyclical auto companies when economic growth has reached maturity. Nonetheless, Ford Motor is a compelling dividend play...and even more so when shares are heading lower since investors get more bang for their buck. The special dividend might not entice investors expecting an economic slowdown to buy the stock, but dividend investors have a lot to look forward to as long as the economy remains vibrant.
