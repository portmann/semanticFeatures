What Ford Said About The Global Economy - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha What Ford said about the global economy. Memorial Day weekend marks the unofficial beginning of summer, and summer driving season. Lower fuel prices mean more of those hot-selling new cars and trucks filling our roads. Despite calls for the current cycle top, U.S. automakers continue to post great sales numbers. Back on April 28th, Ford (NYSE: F ) reported record earnings and beat estimates with record top line growth in both volume and revenue. The company also improved margins, cash flow, and added market share. Here are the non-GAAP highlights Ford reported: North American sales were tremendous, and Europe fared better than expected. Here is a look at the global numbers from Ford's Q1 report: The company cites favorable conditions for industry sales in the U.S. moving forward, supported by healthy labor conditions. Europe is an ongoing recovery, and China growth supported by stimulus measures could be bullish for the industry. Only Brazil and Russia are expected to experience a decrease in demand. Oil prices have recovered, but not many on the street expect too much higher from here, so lower commodity prices can remain a mixed bag as far as truck sales are concerned. Low oil is great for consumers, but low oil prices also signal slower economic activity, which can especially hurt pickup sales in the long run. However, Ford states that global GDP growth is expected to be in the 3.1-3.5% range. Should you believe the company as far as global GDP growth is concerned? Tough to answer, but it seems that when a large, established cyclical company such as Ford predicts business conditions, then some validity, and a grain of salt, seems the appropriate way to consider the statement. Every business operates differently, with some levels of success and failure, but at the very least it should be noted that Ford is doing well no matter the global conditions, and that deserves notice. The Ford F-150 has been an amazing story, from sales to reviews. The truck is safe, powerful, and its sales numbers have been off the charts. Just in April 2016, the Ford pickup vastly outsold every vehicle model in North America. However, if you add in the GMC Sierra, then the numbers between Ford and GM's pickups are nearly even. It should also be noted that the industry posted good numbers for April overall, and it seems for some specific vehicles, sales momentum looks really strong. The truck also has some value, according to Kelly Blue Book , which named the Ford F-150 best value winner in the light pickup category back to back for 2015 and 2016. Consumers have spoken, and Ford continues to surprise to the upside each quarter despite bearish sentiment concerning cycle tops. The company has some new products on the horizon, including the new Fusion, four all-new SUVs, a new Lincoln Continental, FordPass and the Ford Smart Mobility system, to name a few. The success of any of these new vehicles or initiatives depends upon market reception and performance. The automotive industry is changing quickly, and Ford has proven itself capable of changing with it. It possesses the resources and leadership to improve products through technology and innovation, and the company will need to rely upon these assets as the industry dramatically shifts towards maximum efficiency and safety. On Wednesday, June 1st, Ford and GM are scheduled to report monthly sales for May 2016. This preview from Selerity highlights what to expect: Automakers are expected to report a 17.4 million to 17.8 million seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) for May sales. May 2016 sales, likely down 4 percent from a year ago, are expected to be restrained by one less weekend compared with the same month in 2015. On a daily selling rate basis, overall sales expanded by 4 percent when adjusting for two fewer sales days versus May 2015." In the same report, author Craig Bowles summarizes some potential headwinds automakers face moving forward. Rising inventories, incentives, and the health of auto financing are all big concerns for the Street. Car loan financing rates are at or near all-time historic lows, and average new loan term durations are at or near all-time highs. 'Serious' auto loan delinquencies (60 days or more late on payments) rose to 1.12% in the first quarter of this year, a 13.1% increase from the first quarter of 2015. S&P recently warned of increasing risk from low-rated auto loans. Fitch had previously warned that delinquencies in subprime car loans had reached levels not seen since October 1996, according to the MarketWatch.com ." As the above graph illustrates, EPS growth is cruising, with estimates expected to reach $2.27 per share at the end of Q3'16. Some quick valuation numbers put Ford at about 6x earnings at $13.62, 7x at $15.89, 8x at $18.16, and a very bullish 9x earnings equals a share price of $20.43. These numbers assume the company will meet estimates, and not miss or beat by a significant amount for the second half of the year. Ford is a cyclical, so the low side of valuation must also be explored. In the recent past, the stock has traded as low as 2x earnings: in 2009, it traded as low as $1.50 per share, and in 2011, as low as $9.05. The 2009 scenario followed a near-death event for most U.S. automakers, but Ford emerged a winner in the long run. If Ford traded at 2x earnings today, the share price would be around $4.50. Historic tops in valuation can help investors understand what happens to a cyclical when it flies too high. Back in 2014, Ford peaked, and according to S&P Capital IQ, traded from a low of $13.26 (17x earnings) to a high of $18.12 (23x earnings). The stock price has been on a slow decline since that market top. In retrospect, investors should have seen that as a selling opportunity, because as much as we love the F-150, the stock should never be trading at or near 20x earnings, past or present. Stellar EPS growth is another reason Ford traded so high back then as investors piled into "growth at a reasonable price" after a five-year broad market bull run, which left most good growth stocks overvalued. In 2015, Ford traded back into a reasonable range from a high of $16.74 (9x earnings) to a low of $10.44 (6x earnings), and the stock seems to have stabilized into an investable valuation slash trading range since then. The best peer comparison to Ford is General Motors (NYSE: GM ). Both companies have comparable valuation numbers, so it just comes down to which car or truck story investors like better. Right now, only this much: Per usual, technical analysis can send mixed signals. As illustrated in the chart Ford sits slightly above the three relative moving averages and has traded in an upward trend since the February lows. On Friday, May 27th, technical analysis service Market Edge, in their Second Opinion Weekly Report, downgraded Ford to "Avoid" despite citing improving conditions. This quote provides further evidence that technical analysis is indeed confusing business: The technical condition of F is improving. Some of the indicators have turned positive suggesting that a bottom in the stock price has likely occurred. The stock is underperforming the market over the last 50 trading days when compared to the S&P 500. The MACD-LT, an intermediate-term trend indicator, is bullish at this time. A close above $14.72 is a number to watch to confirm a trend reversal. Momentum as measured by the 9-day RSI is gaining in strength. Over the last 50 trading sessions, there has been more volume on down days than on up days indicating that F is still under distribution, which is a bearish condition. The stock is above its 50-day moving average, which is pointed down. This is supportive that the trend is improving." However, if Ford trades below $10.50, then the stock could experience a breakdown to new multi-year lows. A number of risks present a possible downside in the stock. Ford carries a significant amount of debt and does not possess favorable debt-to-equity ratios (Debt/Equity = 4.76, LT Debt/Equity = 3.15). Technical conditions are neutral, but U.S. auto stocks have not traded well since 2014, and perhaps Craig Bowles summarizes the sentiment surrounding the sector best. From the same Selerity report cited in the previous section: U.S. auto stocks are flat-to-lower for more than 2 years despite strong sales. Zero Hedge has pointed out the reason for this is that the automotive inventory-to-sales ratio has been rising since late 2013 and has now risen to levels not seen since 2008. Goldman has warned, "demand has plateaued." U.S. composite economic indexes are fully inverted with the leading inflation index the strongest index for the first time since early 2011. Growth rates: Leading Inflation Index 6.4%, Lagging Economic Index 4.0%, Coincident Economic Index 1.7%, Leading Economic Index 1.4%" Bullish sentiment points to the old adage: all the bad news is already priced in. Remembering that it is a market of stocks rather than a stock market, Ford deserves a look here for a number of reasons. First, the company reported a great quarter, taking some market share along the way. Second, Ford is trading at a low to fair value, and a trap door seems unlikely despite sentiment. And third, the dividend, which is in no danger, yields 4.5%. Add the fact that Ford is a low-dollar cost stock, and compounding coupled with dollar-cost averaging in (and out) suggests that potentially the stock can build some wealth during this current automotive cycle. A cycle top does not signal a top in profitability, and sales can continue to be strong on the lovely ride down. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
