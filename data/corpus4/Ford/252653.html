Zuckerberg To Donate 99% Of His Facebook Shares To "Advance Human Potential" | Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! Here's a little ditty on signs of the looming cashless society  that the banks are foisting upon the boiling frogs of America. Smart money continues to accumulate gold and silver coins. Demand for American Eagle silver coins has also been strong, with year-to-date sales already reaching an annual record at 44.67 million... Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! Moments ago, in a joint letter with his wife Priscilla, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg announced that his wife had just given birth to a daughter, Max, but the real highlight of the letter is the part in the text in which he discloses that in order to "advance human potential" and "promote equality" for all children in the next generation, Zuckerberg begins the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, and that in order to advance this mission, Zuckerberg will give 99% of his Facebook shares, currently worth $45 billion, to "advance this mission" Today your mother and I are committing to spend our lives doing our small part to help solve these challenges. I will continue to serve as Facebookâ€™s CEO for many, many years to come, but these issues are too important to wait until you or we are older to begin this work. By starting at a young age, we hope to see compounding benefits throughout our lives. As you begin the next generation of the Chan Zuckerberg family, we also begin the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative to join people across the world to advance human potential and promote equality for all children in the next generation. Our initial areas of focus will be personalised learning, curing disease, connecting people and building strong communities. We will give 99% of our Facebook shares â€” currently about $45 billion â€” during our lives to advance this mission. We know this is a small contribution compared to all the resources and talents of those already working on these issues. But we want to do what we can, working alongside many others. For the sake of "human potential" and equality of children everywhere, we for one hope that the value of the shares held by the proud new father retain their value in perpetuity, and that billions of people around the world do everything in their power to preserve their own "Facebook revenue generating potential" and spend as many of the 24 hours in a day in front of a Facebook screen as they possibly can, doing what they must for the sake of human betterment: clicking on ads.

Tue, 12/01/2015 - 16:49 | 6862702 pods Normally you have to create the Foundation first and then dump the proceeds of crime into it like the Clintons did. I guess it takes longer to avoid taxes when you already have the money. Tue, 12/01/2015 - 17:18 | 6862832 Buckaroo Banzai What sickens me about this, is the Cultural Marxists will get ahold of this foundation, just like they got hold of most of the other big foundations, to fund their evil purposes. The Ford Foundation is the poster child for this shit. Look at all the progressive code words you can find on their website. Tue, 12/01/2015 - 18:10 | 6862961 Save_America1st so the global NWO elitists created this little fag just like they did  Bill Gates in order to lead the masses right into their traps.  They  gave him what Fraudbook became and allowed him to become some sort of  geek child celebrity just like Bill Gates, and allowed him to reap  Billions while being the face and so-called "creator" of Fraudbook,  essesntially a fucking marketing and spy system database for  sheep-tards.  And so this is obvioulsy the same deal as Bill Gates got  (who was already wealthy anyways by his sell-out, eugenicist dad).  Once  they've made their Billions they will act and be billed as the saviors  of humanity by the gov-scum and traitor media and willfully be the Judas Goats to lead all the sheep-tards to government tyranny and slaughter.  They  will "give" their Billions away for the "benefit of humanity" and will  go down in revisionist history as little fucking angels.  Sure, this  fraudulent little fuck head will get to keep 1%...sounds like he's going  to be living in back alleys sleeping under cardboard boxes, completely  destitute, right?  The sheep-tards would think so because they have no  clue what somebody with 1% of 45 Billion dollars actually has left  over.  450 Million. This asshole will be preaching eugenics,  global warming, anti-white racism, and all kinds of anti-Constitutional  bullshit from coast to coast and will do or say anything for the NWO  that they want him to for the rest of his worthless life.  Tue, 12/01/2015 - 18:29 | 6863108 SoilMyselfRotten Tue, 12/01/2015 - 18:35 | 6863134 MANvsMACHINE Tue, 12/01/2015 - 19:14 | 6863313 J S Bach Tue, 12/01/2015 - 19:37 | 6863424 Divided States ... Tue, 12/01/2015 - 19:54 | 6863498 bunzbunzbunz yeah...or he is getting to the age where he realizes he is mortal and most of the money means nothing. so maybe, juuuust maybe, he wants to try to help people.  in reality, i think he probably wants to market himself as a good person, to make himself and his family less of a target to psycho fucks that actually believe he is an enemy of humanity. Tue, 12/01/2015 - 19:54 | 6863499 Stainless Steel Rat I want my great great great grandkids not to be wal-mart's serfs living paycheck to paycheck in a company owned apartment complex.  I imagine that when their generation comes about, land will be in the hands of about five landlords... I was just thinking about how much of a pussy he is. If he really REALLY wants to help humanity, he would donate 100% of his shares and go and live in a van down by the river. (TY Chris Farley.)

Tue, 12/01/2015 - 18:49 | 6863199 aVileRat What I find incredible is that Zuck is just repeating the Carnigie/DuPont/Rockefeller/Gates/Buffett/Morgan strategy of entrusting your assets, installing your children as 'managers' and thus preventing the govt. from ever taking your wealth. People will see him for generations as a visionary, when in reality Zuckerburg is simply ring fencing his own assets from the future capital gain bill + wealth taxes which will affect the rest of the 99.9%. Tue, 12/01/2015 - 16:58 | 6862742 Ignatius If he really wanted to help he'd use his money to buy a few simple political solutions.  Ironic, I know, but use his money to get concentrated corporate wealth out of the political system, as an example.  But you're right, pods, he's likely just sheltering it like that giant turd Gates and his foundation.

Tue, 12/01/2015 - 19:38 | 6863418 Charming Anarchist Yes and just like BitCoin, the FaceBook infrastructure has a lot of potential to be used for good shit but alas, untrustworthy.  I have a different take on this news.  I do not have the mental capacity to appreciate what $1Billion represents.  It means as much as telling me that the Sun is 90Million miles away.  Those ridiculously astronomic numbers are out of my league of comprehension.  My caveman brain tells me to go with my gut and my gut tells me this is all theater hiding some other shit.  When I first delved into FaceBook, I dreamed of the day where FaceBook would be the CostCo of the legal, security and financial worlds.  I reckoned that FaceBook would put all lawyers out of business by offering "Click Here" formal business, employment and marriage contracts.  Nope.  I reckoned FaceBook would offer cheap dispute resolution services.  Nope.  I reckoned FaceBook would offer life, disablity, medical, dental, car and property insurance packages to its customers.  Nope.  Nope.  Nope.  The sky is the limit to how FaceBook can offer cheap freedom to folks.  Yet, it is nothing put nefarious bullshit.  Tue, 12/01/2015 - 16:50 | 6862705 greenskeeper carl i don't think you need 'inside information' to know that all of this isn't going to end well. Anyone paying attention should be able to tell you that. As to the rest of it, fuck you, zuckerburg. You made your billions encouraging these young people you claim to care about waste their fucking lives sitting on your dumbass site. A whole generation of selfie taking narcicists ignoring each other in social settings while goofing off on their phones. You made your money selling ads to these same people, activiely encouraging them to sepnd mony they don't have on shit they don't need. This has to be one of the most glaring examples of blatant hypocracy Ive ever seen. Your daughters (and mine's) generation will be worse off than mine, which is worse than my parents because of "progressive" fucks like you. Fuck you, fuck off. now you did it.

They  occasionally bring in "Prospects" not yet full-patch members, but if  they play their cards right, for the club, they can become members.

Tue, 12/01/2015 - 18:24 | 6863058 sgt_doom As did the oil depletion allowance and the financial structure of foundations and trusts, allowing for the hiding of ownership and the sheltering of stocks and bonds to avoid taxation and hostile takeover of said stocks! (FYI:  When Rockefeller was supposed to break up his Standard Oil, what he had his lawyers and accountants do instead was to create various foundations, then create holding companies, shift his stocks to those, and move the ownership of said holding companies to his various foundations.  One of the dudes responsible for this, and credited with the creation of the first holding company, was Thomas Scott, later to become the Secretary of War under Lincoln, and the mentor of a guy named Andrew Carnegie --- so a Rockefeller stooge mentored Carnegie, which is probably why there today exists an Andrew Carnegie Rockefeller --- now guess who this dude is descended from?????) Tue, 12/01/2015 - 19:26 | 6863294 Dick Buttkiss The same goes for centralized, fractional-reserve banking. Tue, 12/01/2015 - 18:14 | 6862980 layman_please the tax free foundations are the primary link to influence education, science, policy, media, etc. it's as much about transferring wealth as about reprogramming the culture (that's where zuckerberg's shares are going to be used). that's the real power compared to the money, which is just a mean to the purpose of controlling the society in general. zuckerbergs, clintons and gates are new money. carroll quigley wrote about the old money from the wall street, mainly dominated by the jp morgan et al that established full control over many aspects of life (ivy league, media, left wing parties etc) in america already in the 1930-s.  Because of its dominant position in Wall Street, the Morgan firm came also to dominate other Wall Street powers, such as Carnegie, Whitney, Vanderbilt, Brown-Harriman, or Dillon-Reed. Close alliances were made with Rockefeller, Mellon, and Duke interests but not nearly so intimate ones with the great industrial powers like du Pont and Ford. [Because] ... of the great influence of this "Wall Street" alignment, an influence great enough to merit the name of the "American Establishment," this group could ... control the Federal government and, in consequence, had to adjust to a good many government actions ... [which they had secretly supported ]. The chief of these were in taxation law, beginning with the graduated income tax in 1913, but culminating, above all else, in the inheritance tax. These tax laws drove the great private fortunes dominated by Wall Street into tax-exempt foundations, which became a major link in the Establishment network between Wall Street, the Ivy League, and the Federal government. Dean Rusk, Secretary of State after 1961, formerly president of the Rockefeller Foundation and Rhodes Scholar at Oxford (1931-1933), is as much a member of this nexus as Alger Hiss, the Dulles brothers, Jerome Greene, James T. Shotwell, John W. Davis, Elihu Root, or Philip Jessup. The Eastern Establishment in the U.S. Behind this unfortunate situation lies another, more profound, relationship, which influences matters much broader than Far Eastern policy. It involves the organization of tax-exempt fortunes of international financiers into foundations to be used for educational, scientific, "and other public purposes." Sixty or more years ago, public life in the West was dominated by the influence of "Wall Street." This term has nothing to do with its use by the Communists to mean monopolistic industrialism, but, on the contrary, refers to international financial capitalism deeply involved in the gold standard, foreign exchange fluctuations, floating of fixed-interest securities and, to a lesser extent, flotation of industrial shares for stock-exchange markets. This group, which in the United States, was completely dominated by J. P. Morgan and Company from the 1880's to the 1930's was cosmopolitan, Anglophile, internationalist, Ivy League, eastern seaboard, high Episcopalian, and European-culture conscious. Their connection with the Ivy League colleges rested on the fact that the large endowments of these institutions required constant consultation with the financiers of Wall Street (or its lesser branches on State Street, Boston, and elsewhere) and was reflected in the fact that these endowments, even in 1930, were largely in bonds rather than in real estate or common stocks. As a consequence of these influences, as late as the 1930's, J. P. Morgan and his associates were the most significant figures in policy making at Harvard, Columbia, and to a lesser extent Yale, while the Whitneys were significant at Yale, and the Prudential Insurance Company (through Edward D. Duffield) dominated Princeton.
