Bad News For Ford Bears - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Bears of both U.S. automakers have been vocal about consumer financing worries. This has moved Ford's stock markedly lower while the business shows no signs of letting up. Ford (NYSE: F ) may have just offered us one of the best buying opportunities that we are going to see in the company for quite some time going forward. And at today's stock price, we still think there is a reason to be bullish on Ford if you are a long time dividend oriented investor. There has been much doubt over whether or not Ford and General Motors (NYSE: GM ) are going to recover from the abyss that Mr. Market has put them in over the last few weeks as the broader markets have sold off. Both companies have been smacked lower on fears that subprime auto lending is a primary driver of the business and that sales saturation in key areas, most notably the United States, has hit a peak. The latest data out of the U.S. refutes that, however. We take exception to the financing assertions as well, pointing out that both Ford and General Motors have only noted in their earnings reports that they are pulling modest levers for incentive selling and aggressive financing. We do not think that we are anywhere near the levels that we saw in 2008, which is the argument that many investors are trying to make. But Ford bears have an even bigger problem, and that is that the cold hard sales data continues to refute their case on a week by week, month by month basis. Throughout our bullish sentiment on the company, we have been checking in with key monthly metrics like European auto sales and domestic auto sales, as well as registration data from several countries to try and make sure that our case continued to hold water on the forward-looking basis. We realize that you can only get so much from backward looking conference calls, and so we watch this data on a month-to-month basis to make sure that we don't see any alarming changes to the downside that may show us that the bookcase is stumbling. As for domestic sales, they're extremely important and are the backbone of the company. Gauging U.S. sales is arguably the most important metric one could look at while the company works towards profitability in other geographies. So with regard to a slow down, we have seen nothing of the sort. Instead we continue to see bullish data, with the latest being February's U.S. sales data, which Ford crushed. From Seeking Alpha : Sales growth by brand: Ford +20% to 209,153; Lincoln +30% to 8,039 units. Sales growth by model: Ford Fiesta +1% to 3,754; Ford Fusion +12% to 25,442; Ford C-MAX -0.4% to 1,370; Ford Mustang +18% to 9,993; Ford F-Series +10% to 60,697; Ford Explorer +18% to 20,014; Ford Transit +70% to 11,496; Ford Edge +91% to 12,455; Lincoln MKX +109% to 2,375; Lincoln MKC +12% to 1,746; Lincoln Utilities +41% to 5,312. Ford's average transaction price +2.6% Y/Y to $36,520 (via KBB). All the while, Ford continues to see its core backbone of sales in the United States stay firm and robust. While this is happening, we know that the company is spending significantly in other geographies to try and get the name set up on a global scale. Last quarter, we saw some signs of progress as for the first time, several countries outside of the US showed profitability, or numbers that were close to profitability. As this bottom line swings in that direction, we expect earnings-per-share to be above expectations for the next few years, and we think this will make a point to investors that the stock is undervalued at today's levels. And so we are going to continue investing based on this data. We continue to believe that Ford's dividend, which you can lock in at well over 4% right now, offers a fantastic opportunity for those looking for long-term investing. We also pointed out in our last article a method in which those worried about auto financing can put on a pair trade. Essentially, you can go out and short CACC, which is one of the key players in automobile financing and go long the automobile companies. If you are still worried about the subprime auto risk, you can put on a pair trade by going long Ford and by shorting Credit Acceptance Corp, an idea that has been tossed around on social media over the last few days. CACC is a company that "provides automobile dealers financing programs, and related products and services that enable them to sell vehicles to consumers. It advances money to dealers in exchange for the right to service the underlying consumer loans; and buys the consumer loans from the dealers and keeps various amounts collected from the consumers." In other words, CACC backs all of the auto finance indsutry's loans, and would make for a great hedge to short if you are a nervous investor regarding the subprime lending happening in the auto sector. Regardless, we think Ford bears have a big problem, and that is that the data continues to not be on their side. Ford's guidance for this year was bullish and they met expectations when updated guidance on our last conference call. We know that automobile manufacturers traditionally tend to get a lower multiple because of the cyclical nature of the industry, but we believe the international backbone that Ford is starting to put together will give it diversification that will help it whether the cycles over the course of the long term.
