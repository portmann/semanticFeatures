Don't Fall for This Amazon Payments Car Scam Many people are paying for items online, and it’s becoming more common to even make large payments for items like cars and vacations. Unfortunately there areÂ phishing scams out there that make you think you’re paying through services like Amazon Payments or PayPal, but you’re really sending your money to a fake site and are unlikely to ever see that money again. Here’s how I almost got take by an Amazon Payments scam. A few years ago weÂ were on the hunt for a used car since the transmission blew up on one of our cars. We came across a 2010 Chevrolet Traverse LT for only $11,000. Based on some limited research, this was clearly an excellent deal because most 2010 Traverseâ€™s were going for $18,000 to $25,000 at the time. As much as I was intrigued, my spider senses went up but I still sent an email to inquire for more information anyway. I got a reply from a Mr. William Garcia: This vehicle has absolutely no mechanical problem, the exterior has no scratches, rust or dents and the interior is like new, no accidents. The price includes shipping and handling . I am selling it because I’ve relocated in Europe and it is too expensive to import it here. It is still in Canada at a warehouse in Whitehorse YT ready to be delivered to its buyer with all the documents. Because I am not able to close the deal myself, I want to use a third party to handle the sale. This way we are both protected. Let me know if you’re interested and if you have questions. After asking a few more questions, hereâ€™s the next email I got: The mileage is correct. Let me explain how everything works: I want to use as a third party Amazon Payments (visit their website Amazon Payments). You will have to make the payment to Amazon Payments. The shipping will be started in 24 hours after your payment is confirmed. The vehicle will be delivered in 3 or 4 days. From the moment it arrives at your door, you will have 5 days to test and inspect it. If it doesn’t match my description or if you find anything wrong with it, Amazon Payments will refund your money is 3 working days and I will be in charge of the return shipping fee. They will hold the money until you confirm that the vehicle is as expected. This way we are both protected. I am sure that you have the funds to buy it and you can verify that the vehicle is as advertised knowing that a 3rd party has the payment secured. In order to start the transaction, please go on Amazon Payments and register, once you do that, When I clicked on the link, hereâ€™s a screen shot of the site: Signs of an Amazon Payments phishing scam http://rogersups.comcastbiz.net/Amazon-Payments-Online-Transactions/index.html Nowhere in the URL does it say amazon.com. I decided to play along and put in some information. Hereâ€™s the email invoice I got: Looks pretty legitimate but hereâ€™s some concerns: If you look at the email address of the sender, it does not come from Amazon.com Also if you look at the screen shot below, the banking information is what really should be a concern: I asked William who Jose Orejon Perez was and he relied he was the person chosen by Amazon to supervise the transaction. I then googled â€œAmazon Payment Scamâ€? and found this scam I found stuff dating back to 2005. It’s been a while since I have shopped for a car. I went back to Kijiji to get a screen shot of the ad but they had taken it down already. The internet can be very powerful but it can also be a scary place. Predators like these have taken advantage of people for a long time and will continue to do so. Hereâ€™s some of the warning signs: Over at Amazon, they have posted some good information on spotting scammers . https://resolutioncenter.payments.amazon.com/ Sometimes the link included in spoofed e-mails looks like a genuine Amazon Payments address. You can check where it actually points to by hovering your mouse over the link–the actual website where it points to will be shown in the status bar at the bottom of your browser window or as a pop-up. We never use a web address hosted on a domain other than the ones listed above. For instance, variant domains such as “http://security-payments-amazon.com/.Â .Â .” or an IP address (string of numbers) followed by directories such as “http://123.456.789.123/payments.amazon.com/.Â .Â .” are not valid Amazon Payments websites. Here are a few of the know fake amazon payments sites. There will certainly be others, but this will give you an idea of what to watch out for: http://www.payments-secure-amazon.com Itâ€™s scary how good some of these scam artists are. I guess my guard came up early because of the old saying “If itâ€™s too good to be true, it probably is.” Be careful; be smart; and be skeptical!

For more information you can follow him on Twitter @JimYih or visit his website, Retire Happy . thanks, Jim…this guy almost caught me with his used car scam…i went through exact same process you described…your information helped me to realize that i was about to be scammed…thanks again.. Almost got caught in the same trap with a camping trailer. My wife did not feel good about the transaction method and after I looked into it, I came across your blog. The response I got was almost word for word what you received for your car, but I was trying to purchase a trailer. Just another lesson. Sounded too good, and it was. I can’t believe how close the wording of emails were to the ones you have reported . I’m a senior citizen and I found the best deal ever on a mini excavator supposedly in Regina Sask., all the same words exactly as what you have described and they would only accept a wire transfere. I paid the $10,000.00 and it and my pride were both gone. The money also went to spain where my bank tried to retrieve it for me but the madrid bank account was altready emptied out. RCMP said they can’t help either. It has changed my retirement plans considerably. Thank you for this article. They claimed they are a woman in the military being deployed and again it didn’t come from the same address but still not amazon, amazonfps@buyer-services.com . And all the same signs glad this is on here.i was sure it was legit. same story about the military. supposed to be on base in Kansas.free shipping the nine yards. Same here, military member that was deployed.  How there they use military titles to get the trust of people. Being a retired Sailor that really ticks me off, distracting our uniform like that.  Very shameful.  Who every posted this forum, thank you very much.  I would have made a very big mistake. I got that same info you got about a woman being in the military. A 2003 honda for 2200 smh same lady claiming she was in the military just ripped me off. i was too hasty. i was trying to buy an atv for $1800 and then i got a follow up email stating i my shipment was stuck and i needed to send an additional 1500 to insure the vehicle. At that point i became suspicious. I decided to call a different amazon number (and not the one listed in the email the scammers sent. They told me it was a scam. I also google amazon payments scam and discovered i had make a $1800 mistake. i also was scammed out of $ 3800 for the same atv and was told there is no way to trace the scammers We almost got scammed looking to buy a tractor. Called Amazon and they verified it was a scam. Marion P. This is really interesting, You’re a very skilled blogger. I have joined your rss feed and stay up for in search of more of your excellent post. Also, I’ve yep i got one today for an infinity for 1500..a sob story and send payment to thi amazon payment.  i new right off it was a scam. first why sell a car like that thousands  of dollars.below market value, then seller wants to pay expensive  shipping ..pease shipping is more than the asking price for the car. it made no sense to me Thanks for this blog. I received the exact same wording from this prick. He should be hung by his testicles. A co-worker of mine was also targeted by this scammer.  His rogersups.comcastbiz.net domain is now de-registered and he’s probably moved his phishing site to another domain.  Stay vigilant! I almost fell for the same kind of deal. A 2010 Tundra in Auto Trader for 16,000. Great deal. Contacted the person and here is his emails to me. Thank you for your interested regarding my vehicle. My name is Edward Graham I am a doctor at Park Avenue Medical Clinic in Terrace, BC. The vehicle is still available for sale and the price I am asking for it is $16.000. I am the first owner of the vehicle and it is registered in my name. The vehicle was never involved in any accidents, is fully payed and if you wish I can provide the car proof report. The vehicle is Canadian certified and e-tested. The vehicle is available for inspection in Terrace, BC at Park Avenue Medical Clinic and if you can’t travel there I can ship the vehicle anywhere in Canada on my cost and offer 5 days to personally inspection period. The shipping will take from 3 to 5 days to arrive in front of your door, depending on your location. Along with the vehicle you will receive the bill of sale signed over by me. My wife and I are happy to have found a buyer for our vehicle so soon. If you are not able to travel to Terrace, BC in the next 3 or 4 days to test and inspect the vehicle, since I can only hold the vehicle for you that long. I prefer to use a third party company like Amazon Payments that will hold the funds in their trust account until you receive and inspect the vehicle. The shipping will be handled by my and will be started in 24 hours after your payment is confirmed. The shipping will take from 3 to 5 days to arrive at your door depending on your location and from the moment it arrives you will have 5 days to test drive and inspect the vehicle. If it doesn’t match my description or if you find anything wrong with it (but it won’t be the case since is in flawless condition), Amazon Payment will refund your payment and I will be in charge of the returning fee. Once you have the vehicle inspected you need to contact Amazon to redirect the payment to me. Using Amazon we are both protected, you will have the payment secured by them. Giving the nature of this transaction please note that my sale terms are final and nonnegotiable. If you are ready to purchase the vehicle please forward me your phone number so we can discuss final details. The seller Edward Graham contact us because you wish to know more about how Amazon Payments works. We are happy to assist you in your purchase. Step 1: Buyer and Seller Agree to Terms After registering, both parties agree to terms of the transaction, which includes a description of the merchandise, sale price, number of days for the Buyer’s inspection, and any shipping information. The Seller signs in to Amazon Payments and creates a transaction. Delivery options will be under the seller responsibility Shipping costs will be payed by the seller The buyer is notified by e-mail with the payment invoice and will be asked to submit payment to Amazon Payments. The Buyer submits their payment to the Amazon Payments trust account provided in the payment invoice. When payment is received, it will be verified and secured into a non-interest bearing trust account. After payment is secured, the Seller is notified by Amazon Payments to ship the vehicle to the Buyer. Step 3: Seller Ships Vehicle to Buyer The Seller ships the merchandise to the Buyer’s address listed in the payment invoice. The Seller ships the merchandise and insures the item for the full value. The Seller must pays for the shipment of the merchandise. After the Seller has shipped the merchandise, they must provide the tracking information. The inspection period will not begin until Amazon Payments has confirmed delivery of the merchandise. When the Buyer accepts the merchandise or the inspection period expires, the disbursement of payment will begin. Payment is sent to the Seller. Upon the merchandise being accepted, Amazon Payments verifies the transaction information and releases funds per the Seller’s instruction. I phoned Amazon to confirm this information and they told me it was a SCAM. They don’t even offer this kind of third party payment plan. I am glad I did some research and saved myself $16,000. I’m dealing with one of these scammers now for a Landcruiser $14500. I smelt a rat when the location of the car changed from Queensland to Western Australia and he’s in the military about to go to the UK. This is his email address if anyone knows how to catch him… Kevin Grant  Below is his story As I told you in my previous e-mail at this moment I am in a military base, RAAF Base Pearce, WA getting ready for Benson UK, and I have the car with me. This mean that I do a special training program. I am not allowed to get out of the unit or have visitors. I can ship the car to you without problems using army transport and logistic system. You will receive the car along with all the documents. As for the payment I can start a transaction through Amazon Payments http://www.amazon.payments.home-aus.com/ . All I need is your full name and address so i can contact them and after that they will contact you regarding this purchase. They act as a third party and will protect both of us in this transaction. You’ll make the payment into an Amazon managed trust fund! After that, i send it over( the car will be delivered with the title, owner’s manual, service records, and of course the bill of sale authorized and signed by me) You will have 5 days inspection period on it from the day you’ll receive the car, you can inspect it, take it to a mechanic to check it out, ride it and then if you decided to keep it, you’ll confirm to Amazon the sale. If by any reason, you will not be satisfied with the car ( even though I can assure you that it is exactly as described, in excellent condition), you can return it at my expense for a full refund of your money, no hidden or extra cost for you. So, this is not a blind transaction, you can see it before committing to buy and to eliminate any concerns you will have 5 days to inspect it. I think this is more than fair for both of us. I tried to explain as best I can but if you have further questions do not hesitate to contact me. I am looking for anyone that may know anyone that has fallen victim to the Amazon car scam.I am looking to start a Class Action Lawsuit against Amazon. They are aware of the scam and have done nothing to notify loyal customers on the website or even in writing. Please pass the word around thousands of people have been scammed out of so much money and they don’t care about their consumers…..Repost and let others know. hello Elisha, i did not get scammed by amazon, but my Google check out so i know how you feel! Let me know how it goes with that law suit maybe i will take one up with Google checkout now known as Google wallet. Hi, Elisha. Dumb me, fell for the scam. Luckily, the Money Gram Agencies noticed the “payment agency/ Amazon Payment” and flagged the transaction before it went through.  They contacted me within minutes of my purchasing the money gram and refunded my money. I got scammed just the other day. I am a student and they scammed me just over Â£2000 I am still in shock and extremely upset because of it! Hi Elisha, I am based in the Uk and I have just been scammed by the amazon Payments scam after seeing a classified advert on eBay for Â£3800. I don’t know how old your post is regarding a lawsuit and would welcome any feedback. I as well was one of the unlucky ones. Almost four grand ripped off by a s45evans@gmai.com I saw the Amazon part and thought it was legit since ive ordered from am Aaron zon before. I wish i wouldnt have been so naive Hi Elisha I don’t know how long is your post, I’m recently a fallen of victim of scam.  She post on the craiglist  2005 Acura lt 74,980 miles for $1900 by using  the third party  amazon payment using the moneygram. I trusted the amazon website so I go for it . Amazon should post the warning on their website to let their customer knows what’s going on. If you ever lawsuit  against amazon , I will join you I almost bought this same car.. she says she is an oceanographer and gives all this info and when you run the vin# it’s registered to Patricia Shelton in Chattanooga TN… this is crazy and someone needs to stop her before anyone else is scammed. Holy fuck. I came on here because i was worried that i was getting scammed for a 2004 Acura TL priced at $2,000. SHE ALSO CLAIMED SHE WAS AN OCEANOGRAPHER. This is what she emailed me: I’ve received your email regarding the 2004 Acura TL with 69,000 miles on it. The car is still for sale and my asking price is $2,000. It is a 2004 model loaded with everything, VIN# 19UUA66244A066787. The car is very well maintained and it has just been completely serviced. The engine( 6 Cylinder)  runs very good and the automatic transmission shifts perfectly. The car is in perfect condition with clear title,no accidents, no liens or loans. I’m an oceanographer and I’m on sea at this moment, so I left the car in Mc Lean, VA, at the shipping company, it’s already packed and waiting to be shipped anywhere.  Shipping/delivery is included in this price as I almost closed the deal with another customer but he was unable to take the loan from the bank. I’ve already prepared shipping for him as he was out of state. it happend to me , just a week ago , Somebody put a ad on kijiji about a honda civic and she sent me a reply and we guys tolked for 3 days then , she said they are gonna make it from amazon as a third party for payment . I got a reply from amazon next day and they said to pay certain amount about 1500 CAD through intrac to their bank manager , I never dealt wth these stuff and i m new to canada I made the payment very next day . So I dun knw police is gonna help me or not , i will get my money back or not , Bt i am wth u .. in near future. Recently fuel price increases have drastically reduced the value of trucks and SUVs as they flood the used car market. According to Natural Resources Canada, driving standard with these features I wanted to thank you personally for your info. On here!! I thought I was buying a boat on boat trader but it turned out you needed to wire money through moneygram. So I did … $2600.00 thinking its ok. No it wasn’t real. I called moneygram an hour later after reading this site.. I was lucky enough to get my money refunded by calling the 800# on the receipt. The girl at the register told me a story about how her little sister wasn’t as lucky. She was trying to buy her first car, they took the money and ran!! Thank Goodness I came googled this information. I am looking for a car for my sister and a 1999 Honda was listed for 750.00 on craigslist.  I emailed her and she gave this information about being a ssg in the military and was preparing for deployment. it didn’t feel right. Thank you for this helpful info I saw a listing for a 2003 chevy Tahoe by a michelle taylor last night (3/1/13) and it is exactly the same story. something told me to google amazon payment and it brought me here, thank god! WOW. IM GLAD I DIDN’T FALL FOR THE SCAM. YESTERDAY NIGHT.I WAS ON CRAIG’SLIST IN SEARCH.FOR A VEHICLE, SURE THING I FOUND A NICE LEXUS FOR A GOOD PRICE OF WHAT WAS 2,500! I CONTACTED THE OWNER BY EMAIL. AND THIS WAS HER I’m writing you regarding my 2006 Nissan Maxima SE. The price I’m looking for is $1800. The car has 52,000 miles,and is in perfect condition, there’s not even a scratch on it. Everything from the motor to the tiers is shining and looking brand new. I am desperate,I need urgently money because my little girl has a big health problem. I only deal through Amazon so if you’re interested in purchasing let me know. Also let me know if you need any more info on this wonderful car or if you have any other questions of any sort. http://s1308.beta.photobucket.com/user/2006nissanmaxima3/library/ WHICH INVOLVED A THIRD PERSON. PARTY…. AMAZON PAYMENTS AMAZON@YOUR-VEHICLE-PROTECTION.. This vehicle has absolutely no mechanical problem, the exterior has no scratches, rust or dents and included. I am selling it because I’ve relocated in Europe and it is too expensive to import it here. It is still in Canada at a warehouse, ready to be delivered to its buyer with all the documents. Because I am not able to close the deal myself, I have chosen to use a third party at the warehouse ready for delivery. I want to use Amazon Payments because I have an agreement with them and a purchase protection account of $50000 so we will both be 100% protected in this deal. Let me know if you’re interested and if you have questions. PS: I attached all the pictures I got ….so now you can see exactly what you can get for this See same scam here. 2011 lexus IS 350, priced for $12100. I am almost caught. See your blog. Thanks a lot. Almost fell for the same scam today. They are using a web site Tom Truck inc. 2003 Jeep Wrangler rubicon. He said a guy from Victoria traded the Jeep for a truck. Would ship free to Canada. But needed to use a 3rd party for payment Amazon payment. I did some research before sending the money. The trucking company does not exist. The amazon web site is bogus.I even spoke on the phone with him a few times and his phone #is a voip line. He wanted confirmation of the money transfer by fax. The fax line was voip out of NYC. The money was to be transferred to Barcleys bank in England Same scam, same wording.  First one was for 1996 Casita camper located in the state of Washington.  Amazon Payments Account Manager in Pittsburgh PA.  At MoneyGram agent, they noticed a number was lacking and couldn’t complete transaction.  When I contacted the US Army, the item went off the sale list and no reply was made.  The second was for RV in ND; now I have received the Amazon Invoice and see it is the same wording and no complete number as needed.  So much for this game.  There should be a fine for illegal sells. The scam continues. Brent Lindsay has offered to ship the car for free – to Australia!!!! According to another blog I read Amazon has a limit of $1000 per month so car sales simply cannot be transacted there. The police should do sting operations on these types but I reckon the actual people behind it are probably in Malaysia. That’s where the Western Union scam seems to run from. It’s amazing how these scams are taking off and even though people are much more informed about them than before, still many of them fall in such traps and end up losing their hard earned money. Thank you for your post. I had the exact same scam while looking to buy a boat. Many red flags, found your post as I was doing some investigation before sending any money. Had the exact same wording. This transaction is still in progress as far as the scammer is concerned. You saved me $15,000. Thanks. I nearly fell for this today here in the uk,  everything looked so genuine and a legitimate story behind it too.  I owe my mate a pint for spotting this blog,  and i owe big thanks to the writer for posting it.  Cheers. I had the exact same one as above regarding a 35K Backhoe for $10,200 including shipping from Whitehorse and the guy (Tim Matthews) was in Europe.   I had several emails back and forth. I checked the linked website and contacted the help asking about my concerns and got a response within an hour stating that they indeed do this for people outside of the country, what they need was the guys name, email and description on the item.    Asked the guy and he sent me the info within minutes, forwarded it back to Amazon Payments mail, but haven’t heard back yet…… Now more suspicious I looked on line and found another Amazon Payment (the real one) and the url did not match the one that was linked to me. This is pretty sophisticated, they have created a mirror website that you can actually contact and ask a question regarding your concern saying that it is legit!        Very believable and convincing.   Sooooo Mr Tim Matthews no scam for you!!!!!       Since this I reported the Kijijji ad as a scam.        And I just got an email from him asking ;      So did you talk with Amazon? Are we good to go? Why can’t these people be tracked down?        I hope this type of scam gets more attention to prevent other people out there from getting suckered. I noticed two emails from Amazon exactly the same.   When I said I didn’t get a response from amazon, he must have had them resend it!   LOL      It stated that Tim Matthews was a registered customer and that we could proceed with the transaction, all I needed to do was register!    NOT! with approx. 79K Miles sob story that her husband and son was killed by a drunk truck driver and this vehicle was her son of only 19 years of age and she needs to sale it brings back to many memories.  She moved back to Orlando with her parents and has set up payments to go through Amazon Payments have to send through Walmart/Money Gram service to our Amaazon agent his name was:  Daniel Wilbur I even asked for a car fax and it checked out only thing I saw was owner was from Philadelphia and she said she had moved though back to Orlando with her parents. Linda Grisso 905 N Orange Ave. Orlando FL  32801 United States I assume this is all a scam from the reading’s above Does Amazon even sale cars ! –guess not …. Thanks for saving my butt I can’t afford to loose 2K I’ve received your email regarding the 2008 Honda Accord EX-L with 68,714 miles on it, Automatic, Gasoline, Engine: 3.5L. The car is still for sale and my final price is $2,700. The car is in perfect shape, never been smoked in, without scratches no dents, and it has never been involved in any kind of accidents. I legally own, free of any liens or loans, under my name.The engine runs very good and the automatic transmission shifts perfectly. Iâ€™m selling the car because I lost my husband and my child of only 19 years, with 2 months ago in a car accident.A drunk truck driver hit them.They were in my husbandâ€™s car and they didn’t had a chance.This was my child’s car and brings me a lot of memories that make me suffer and this is the reason for what I want to sell it as soon as possible. I only deal through Amazon so if you have any other questions, or need more info, please free to ask. It sounds too good to be true, but I sent a reply anyways saying that I’d like to check out the vehicle personally and if that’s okay then send me another email so we can figure out the details. I got the exact same email, word for word, but for an ’08 F-150 and was about to go ahead with the transaction, but I ended up seeing this blog. Thanks for posting this, saved me a lot of money. P.S it’s still up and running today (Oct. 2nd/2013) I just posted a complete breakdown of how the scam works at http://www.theclassiccarfactory.blogspot.com so you can identify it in the ad – with examples of several scam ads listed right now on Craigslist and carsforsale.com Almost got caught in one today.. My husband and I were looking for a used side by side utv and saw a fully loaded 2012 Polaris 900 xp for $9350 on the autotrader website. Seemed like a good deal, only a few thousand off the price of new utv, so it didn’t seem too far off the mark… Just enough to get us interested. The woman’s name was Jennifer Hamilton, and she claimed to have been transferred to Winnipeg and would not be able to use it. She gave the same line about the vehicle being at an amazon warehouse and wanting to use them for both of our protections. My husband checked out the link and it looked good as well… One of the big red flags for us was the email address of Amazon Flexible Payments was “amazon-payments-fps@comcast.net”…. If this was a ligit email, wouldn’t Amazon have the address end in amazon.com?? Also the link to the website ended in “.wink.cs” what is that. HA…I found TWO of these Amazon.com schemes in the Roanoke VA area for a car in Tampa for an “Oceanographer” at sea selling an 2006 Lexus ES for $2404…another one was in Winston Salem NC for a car that was in Atlanta …since I lived in Atlanta, after at first being suckered in for a normally $10,00 2006 Acura TL for $1900(HAHA..they know how to take advantage of our greed as well as materialism)I put “her” to the test and said I was visiting on Saturday and she could meet me a various malls or any public place of her choosing where she could receive cash and save on “shipping”. Today I receive an email saying since she initiated the  transaction with Amazon payments..she would keep it that way, instead of risk her “career and freedom” for that amount of money…After I stopped laughing I sent them a reply saying all one has to do is google “Amazon Payments” and “buying cars” and numerous websites with scam in the title appear. Thank God I found this and other sites before I gave away all of the money I will have for a while out of greed. Once she started the transaction a site calling itself Amazon Payments had official looking page with picture of the auto..a contract manager’s name and email(but no number) and a bunch of other passable elements to fool people..until they get to the moneygram part. Anyway I think the reason they have went to smaller amounts in they’re scams asking for less than $3k is because Now Moneygram and Western Union have caught on….I wish the poster luck in suing Amazon.com because they should be doing SOMETHING to keep so many people from being scammed in their name Many thanks to all of you! My emails were verbatim to yours most of the time. I didn’t bite BIG yet, so no loss but I was really close. My family saw red flags before I did so I decided to do just a little research – boy was I surprised and really disappointed.  I really wanted that CHERRY 1956 Chevy Bel Air coupe.  Watch out if anybody else tries for it. I just stumbled across another example of this on Craigslist.  a really nice 2001 Harley for only $5K and then was told that it included shipping and handling as well. When something sounds too good to be true it usually is. I got an email response from the seller which is almost identical to the original one posted above and pointing to a ficticious spoofed Amazon site. Glad I can read a URL and did some poking around first. Yes, it is IS250, sorry about the mistake in the ad. It has 27,000 miles. I’m the second owner. Before I left the country, I arranged a safe sale through Amazon Flexible Payments. I’ve moved the car to our Army Barracks, Grantham, Lincolnshire to keep it in a safe place until I find a buyer for it. The shipping process is not an issue. The vehicle will be delivered with the 2 keys,full paperwork and the V5 signed by me. This is how  works : Amazon FPS will hold your payment until you’ll receive and agree with to purchase my vehicle. It will be shipped at your home address in maximum 3 days.Amazon will offer you a 7 days for inspection, from the day you’ll receive the car, that means you can inspect it at your own place, take it to a mechanic, drive it, and then if you decide to keep it, you’ll confirm to Amazon the sale and they will transfer the payment to me. If, by any reason, you will not be satisfied with my car you can return it at my expense for a full refund of your money, no questions asked.You are not risking any pounds and you’ll have the chance to check the vehicle before the final decision. This Amazon transaction is eligible for vehicles, because I paid some extra taxes. I think this is a fair procedure for both of us. This Amazon service is secured because your payment is 100% covered. I have an open Bank Account with Amazon FPS and if something goes wrong, you will get a full refund from my account. Amazon will confirm this, when we will open the case with them. Your payment is just a security measure, to make sure that you are serious, and that I am not going to ship the car, and lose time and money. You are not risking any pounds and you’ll have the chance to check the car before the final decision.You can read more about this service in the attached document. I need to provide your details to Amazon so they can open a case for us. Please reply with your full name and your shipping address, a contact phone # so I can ask Amazon to open a case! After that, they will contact you to explain all the details regarding the transaction. I just came across an ad for a 2009 harley davidson for only 7700.oo dollars in whitehorse. Almost got it until i came across your blog. thank you.After i answered the ad. i went back on kijiji to look at the bike and it was already down. This time it was a Michelle Bingley claiming to be an army medic posted in Germany. She had exported the van over from the UK “for safe keeping” and would use Amazon Payments to do the deal, then deliver it to me. The email claiming to be from Amazon was from customer.safety@mail.com . The domain mail.com is a free mail account with 1&1 and nothing to do with Amazon. I sent an email to them saying that I was doing security checks, within a few minutes they had sent an email from the above address claiming to be from Amazon payments saying the transaction was legitimate and strongly advised me to make the payment. What they did not know was that I had given Amazon a different email address. They had sent it to the one I was using with the seller, LOL BUSTED. I was about to get scammed! This is the email i received from someone that called herself Susan R Taylor: I have a low price on my 2004 Honda Accord LX because I want to sell the car very quickly.The price is $2,400 including delivery to your home address.The car is in perfect condition, no electric problems, no Â  accidents/liens/loans. No scratches, never been repainted. I have all the car manuals, title,documents. I’m selling this car because my child of only 23 died 4 months ago in a car accident,a drunk driver hit him Â  and his fiancee. He was with his fiance’s car coming to our home at his little brother birthday of 10 years old. The car belonged to my son and it brings me bad memories and that’s the reason I want to sell it. The last price is $2,400. Me and my husband travel a lot with our business and we want to make this deal through Amazon Buyer Protection Â Program. Thank you, the car is located in West Palm Beach, FL at DAS ( Dependable Auto Shippers ) headquarters, in the container, sealed and ready for Â shipping. You will have 10 days so you can inspect the car. Once you have inspected the car and decided to keep it, you will confirm your decision to Amazon and only then they will re-route the money in to my account, but if by any reason, you won’t be satisfied with the car you can return it back for a full refund of your money. I will take care of the shipping, don’t worry. You will receive the car with all the Â necessary papers (clear title, bill of sale, userâ€™s manual, insurance etc). Just get back with your full name and full shipping address and I will get everything started as soon as possible, then Amazon will contact you with further instructions But then some how i received another msg similar to the previous ones that made it even look more shady.. Thank you for your inquiry regarding my car. It is in perfect condition, there’s not even a scratch or any dents on it. Everything about it is in perfect condition. I have clear title for it, no liens or loans. The car is priced to sell quickly and the final price that I’m asking for it is $2,350 including shipping and handling costs. My husband died 3 months ago and me and my daughter decided to sell the house and move to my sister’s. The car reminds us very much of my husband but we finally understood that we have to move on with our lives. Although my husband will have his place in our hearts forever. I can’t afford to take days off my work for this sale so i’m trying to sell it online. If you are really interested in purchasing the car please reply to this email and i will provide further instructions regarding payment and delivery. These emails were susbaldw@gmail.com andsusan.r.taylor74@gmail.com My name is Daniel Robson ,I am the owner of the 2008 FORD FIESTA (B256/7) ST 16V. Regarding the car, it is in perfect condition, no accidents, no damage, scratches or dents. HPI clear, the car is fully paid. It is registered to United Kingdom .It has 51,000 miles REG:BP08UEK.And It drives like new, garage kept and babied. The price i was looking for is Â£2,600 since i am looking for a fast sale and don’t have time to negotiate so this is the basic price. Regarding the sale, i am selling it because i had to move back in Netherlands with work,i already bought another car here as i was unable to register the Ford here since the fees are to high being a UK model and specs. I work as a broker and as stated before i already bought a car here. If you are interested in purchasing i want to use a third party for our protection in this case Amazon Payments Using theyr services it allows you as the buyer to receive the car first and also give you an inspection period of 7 days in wich you can decline the sale if you are not satisfied. I doubt that since the car is in perfect condition. The shipping will be home delivery and insured. If you want to move forward with the sale and have the payment email me your entire name, shipping address and also your phone number , so i can call you and discuss further details and also forward all the info to Amazon Payments so they can contact you also with all the details regarding the transaction, how you are protected and also payment details/options.

Emails from Romania. How do these people even come up with this stuff…this one was good, not as low down shitty as the dead child one…People should be put in town squares in chains for months.

The car is still for sale and my asking price is $2,000. It is a Altima model loaded with everything, VIN# 1N4BL11D35N400917.Â  The car is very well maintained and it has just been completely serviced. The engine (3.5L V6 ) runs very good and the automatic transmission shifts perfectly. The car is in perfect condition with clear title, no accidents, no liens or loans. The mpg is 24 city and 32 highway and never been involved in a accident, Non-smoker. I’m an oceanographer and I’m on sea at this moment, so I left the car in Chattanooga, TN, at the shipping company, it’s already packed and waiting to be shipped anywhere. Shipping/delivery is included in this price as I almost closed the deal with another customer but he was unable to take the loan from the bank. I’ve already prepared shipping for him as he was out of state. Thanks…. im glad I read your blog today this is the email we got: elisabeth White who claims to be an oceanographer: I’ve received your email regarding the 2005 Nissan Altima with 74,000 miles on it. The car is still for sale and my asking price is $2,000. It is a Altima model loaded with everything, VIN# 1N4BL11D35N400917.Â  The car is very well maintained and it has just been completely serviced.

I’m an oceanographer and I’m on sea at this moment, so I left the car in Chattanooga, TN, at the shipping company, it’s already packed and waiting to be shipped anywhere. Shipping/delivery is included in this price as I almost closed the deal with another customer but he was unable to take the loan from the bank. I’ve already prepared shipping for him as he was out of state. The car is located at the shipping company since someone agree to buy it, but at the end he never got the loan. For this reason the shipping is included. Also the price is small because I don’t have time for negotiations and I need money soon for my research. The car is in perfect condition with clear title, no liens or loans. All the documents including the title and the bill of sale with my signature on it, will come along with the car and it will take no more than 2-3 days for the car to arrive at your address. The transaction will be made thru Amazon Payments because they can protect both of us and they also offer 5 days inspection period. You’ll have 5 days to inspect, test and drive the car before decided to keep it or not. If the vehicle is not like I described, you’ll ship it back on my expense and they will give you a full refund. Amazon Payments will hold the funds until you receive the car with all the papers work. Only after you confirm them that you wanna keep the car they will release me the funds. In this way, you will be able to inspect the vehicle before committing to buy it. If you want to start the transaction with Amazon Payments just reply me with your full name, shipping address and your phone number. Thx ad ur blog…..we almost fell for a scam as well. Below is the email Elsabeth White who claims to be an oceanographer:’ve received your email regarding the 2005 Nissan Altima with 74,000 miles on it.

I’ve already prepared shipping for him as he was out of state. I found this information to late. I just lost $2,000.00 with a wire transfer for a truck with this exacted scam. I feel like such a fool and frankly taking it hard. I was in need and desperate and didnâ€™t ask enough question before I sent the payment. The Amazon 3rd party protection put my guard down.  I really hate that someone can steal from people that are in need of a little help and a break. It was hard to hear that my bank Wells Fargo do not reimburse wire transfer and that Iâ€™m not protected.  I hope I can recover but this is a expensive lesson to trust anyone anymore. It makes me think Iâ€™m on the wrong side of the law to know that this person can get away with stealing money without much effort or risk. Thank you so much for posting all these blogs on the Amazon Scam. Almost all exact wording except 03 Nissan Altima in Portlands Craigslist. The car is stored in a warehouse in California and something about being to busy to do transaction herself cause she’s divorced and her child is sick. I think its wrong also to say that Amazon is going to be sued, its not Amazons fault this is going on, basically anyone should do their homework, especially when spending that type of money online. All u have to do is type in key word, like Amazon Payments and scam after it in Google to see if there is any foul play going on. Thanks for everyone’s help in figuring this out! This scam is still going here in UK, November 2014. We got caught out using Piston Heads. I hope “Mr Jason Drew” aka “Muhammed Idrees” rots in hell as it took us a long time to save for that car. Fallen victim to this – I’m only 17 and I’ve been conned out of Â£2,400 from my savings. Wish I’d done my research and come across this blog earlier. National Fraud Office is involved now, probably won’t get my money back from the so called ‘Patricia Turner’ situated in Austria who is having her having her ‘voice box replaced’ (hence no phone calls)’ or ‘Amazon flex pay’. Thanks Jim! I always do diligence when purchasing big ticket items. Looking at a nice camaro on the cars site a couple of weeks ago. I responded to the owner and received a email a few weeks later. The same amazon payment was indicated as the middle man to protect us both. I then looked back at the cars site and the cars did not show up. Since the vehicle is on the west coast and I live on the east coast it would be a expense just to view this in person. I am going to pursue the conversation online and indicate I will be flying in to see the vehicle in person. I’ll see were this goes. Thanks for the information and your time spent! response e-mails from: Sgt Travis Sabinash travis.sabinash@hotmail.com I thought it was real because I found this name listed in the US military, but probably not really him – the e-mails were filled with broken English. Feel sorry for the real Travis. he is currently in a military base, Malmstrom Air Force Base in Cascade, MT, and the car is there with him. Wow, that same name and email tried selling me a 82 el Camino on carsforsale… Same story different places… I am so glad that I didn’t go through with it. Here is an email reply I got from a Lt.Janmes Morrow of the RAAF in the Military base in the NT, Australia. As I mentioned in my previous e-mail at this moment I am in RAAF Tindal, NT military base, getting ready for Afghanistan, and I have the car with me. I’m in a special training program before my deployment and I am not allowed to get out of the unit or have visitors. I can ship the car to you without problems using army transport and logistic system. You will receive the car along with all the documents. As for the payment I can start a transaction through Amazon Payment. All I need is your full name and  address so I can contact them and after that they will contact you to explain the entire procedure without any obligation to buy it or fees.They act as a third party and will protect both of us in this transaction. You’ll make the payment in an Amazon managed trust fund! After that, I send it over ( the car will be delivered with the title, owner’s manual, service records, and of course the bill of sale authorized and signed by me). You will have 7 days inspection period on it from the day you’ll receive the car, you can inspect it, take it to a mechanic to check it out, ride it and then if you decided to keep it, you’ll confirm to Amazon the sale. If by any reason, you will not be satisfied with the car ( even though I can assure you that it is exactly as described, in excellent condition), you can return it at my expense for a full refund of your money, no hidden or extra cost for you. So, this is not a blind transaction, you can see it before committing to buy and to eliminate any concerns you will have 7 days to inspect it and I think this is more than fair for both of us. I tried to explain as best I can but if you have further questions do not hesitate to contact me. I will wait your details (full name and shipping address) if we have a deal. I have notified http://www.drive.com.au And please everybody, do some research before committing to any financial transactions online. We would’ve lost $19,900 of our hard savings, which means our kids would miss out. Thanks for sharingâ€¦ I just avoided this fate. This vehicle was a 1956 Ford F100 that was listed on EBay (classified Ad). My emails are from Capt Peter Cape. As I told you in my previous e-mail at this moment I am in a military base, RAAF Base Pearce, WA getting ready for Afghanistan, and I have the car with me. This mean that I do a special training program. I am not allowed to get out of the unit or have visitors. I can ship the car to you without problems using army transport and logistic system. You will receive the car along with all the documents. As for the payment I can start a transaction through Amazon. All I need is your full name and address so i can contact them and after that they will contact you regarding this purchase. They act as a third party and will protect both of us in this transaction.

Well Peter Cape must know James Dobson who is also in special training at the RAAF base in Pearce WA. Apparently he also needs to get rid of his Nissan Patrol ute really quickly for a ridiculously cheap price! We’ve just been victims of this scam in the Uk by trying to purchase a car advertised on Autotrader. We’ve lost Â£3,100.  The fraudster said the car was ready in Austria to be shipped to us because she was in hospital over there needing an urgent operation.  All looked so good but now stunned how we could have been so stupid to be taken by it. Thank YU soo much for this article. I was a few days from buying a scam. A 2011 Jeep Wrangler is listed for $12220. The female said they she is in the army and that the car is located in Washington state.i am so glad I read this. You can right away tell something is not right about this listing. Looks like I almost fell for it twice!! iim a college student looking to buy a cheap car. Went on Craigslist to find some found two. They looked pretty nice. Emailed the people and the email is just like yours. First I got a woman saying her husband and daughter died so she doesn’t want the car because it reminds her of them. She wanted to do Amazon payments. I’ll attach the email. Thanks for your interest regarding my 2007 Toyota Camry SE. The price I’m looking for is $2,500 with shipping included. Let me give you a few details about it: very good shape, no mechanical issues,no loan or lien ,no scratches or dents,with a clean title and it has never been involved in any kind of accidents! Has only 98,000 miles, it’s automatic, with an 2.4L V4.Iâ€™m selling it because I lost my husband and my daughter of only 19 years 1 month ago in a car accident. A drunk truck driver hit them. They were in my husbandâ€™s car and they didnâ€™t have a chance. This was my daughter’s first car and brings me a lot of memories that make me suffer and this is the reason for what I want to sell it as soon as possible and at this price.I only deal through Amazon so if you have any other questions, or need more info, please free to ask. The next email was a woman claiming she was in the military and that she needed to sell the car immediately. Hi, right now I’m in a military base. We are training, getting ready for leaving the country. The delivery process will be managed by me. I think I can have it there at your home address within 2-3 working days. It will come with a clear title and reg. I am a member of the eBay buyer protection program and using this service you will get a 7 days testing period after delivery. During that 7 days testing period I will not be getting any money. I need to know if you are interested so I can ask eBay to send you the details on this deal. If interested please include in your next email your contact info for eBay (your name, your address and phone number), so we can get the ball rolling. I am very lucky to read your article.

She gave her phone number as being 205-607-0984. He had already sent the $2,000 when I found out. Now there is no answer at that number.  I know he is out the money and there is nothing we can do but tighten our belts. My O7 Chevrolet Suburban 1500 LTZ is still for sale. It has  161k miles.Automatic, clear title.

Using Amazon service we are both 100% covered during the steps of  this transaction. My wife and I were looking for a Jeep Wrangler for our daughter so we decided to look on craigslist for some good deals. Well, the whole thing seemed a little fishy and it turned out to be a scam. Thankfully we didn’t send any money but here’s the email that they sent us so none of you guys will fall for a scam like this: “Hello there, Glad you are one of the people interested in buying my 2007 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon. I’m selling it because I’m serving in Offutt AFB, Nebraska but I was promoted and transferred to Elmendorf AFB in Anchorage Alaska for a 3 years period, so I don’t need it anymore at this time. Let me give you a few details about it: very good shape, no mechanical issues,no scratches nor dents and it has never been involved in any kind of accidents. Has only 45,000 miles, its automatic, with an 4.0L V6 cyl. engine, 4 x 4, black exterior and gray interior. Not interested in a trade and my final price is $5,800. I have a clear title, free of any liens or loans on it, under my name. Also, I’ve attached you some more pictures with the vehicle in this email. So then we replied and she responded so that’s when we got the feeling that we were being set up. I will do my best to walk you through the process. As I  told you in my first email, I recently got promoted and transferred to Elmendorf AFB in Anchorage Alaska for a 3 years period, so I don’t need the vehicle anymore at this time. The vehicle is located in Omaha , NE, but I advertised it on other states also to get more exposure and sell it faster. It is already at the shipping company headquarters , sealed and ready to be delivered to its future new owner. The deal is handled by Amazon so I don’t have much to do about it. Using Amazon Safepay, you get free delivery, at your place in maximum 48hours. In addition, you get 5 days to try it out before buying it, and if you don’t like it, you can send it back at my expense ( I assure you that is not going to happen since my vehicle is in immaculate condition ). If you wish to proceed just send me an email with your full name (for the bill of sale), a delivery address and a phone # where you can be reached and I will forward them to Amazon and they will send you the invoice with all of the transaction details. P.S. On the invoice you can find delivery details, payments options and safety plans, and as well their main toll free # for any questions you may have! Please don’t fall for scams like these, they may seem very realistic but always do your research before buying something on Craigslist Looks as though I nearly bought this scam , I felt something was, t right after several mails with 3 days delay each time the person told me they had been deployed until end of this year with the military in kahtmandue. I still had this niggle until I came across this site exactly the same type of reply from the seller’s thank you for highlighting this scam saved a lot of heartache I found a 2007 Escalade for $5,500. I emailed to see where the vehicle was located. She said it was at the military base in Ft. hood and there was no way for me to see it. She was deploying on September 9th for Korea. She arranged the transaction with Amozon Safeway. shipping would be free because the military pays for vehicle shipping upto twice a year. I knew it was too good to be true! I got the same woman from Ft. Hood stating that she is going to be deployed and needs to sell car, 2011 Toyota Forerunner for $6500.  Payment could be arranged via Amazon after 5 day testing period blah, blah, blah.  Be careful and be smart! The car has been bought  from Dubai,I have attached a copy of the reg card in this email.The car is already at the shipping company in Madrid sealed and ready for the shipping. My presence won’t be necessary because I prearranged the deal with Amazon. The deal includes free delivery and it will arrive at your address in 3 days. You will have 5 days to try out prior to making any purchase and if by any reason you find something you don’t like about it you can send it back at my expense. If you are interested in knowing more info about how it works, I can ask Amazon to send you an email with more information on how to purchase it.Amazon will contact you shortly after they have the details with all the confirmation that you need to complete this deal and you will also have proof that I am covered by them and a legitimate seller. If you would like to receive the email from Amazon will all the transaction information please reply with your full name and shipping address and they will contact you right away. Thanks for the posting it has been very helpful.  Found a car on Craig’s list that was reasonably priced and allegedly in Dayton, OH and was being sold because it was a third car they didn’t need.  Contacted the seller and expressed interest and was informed that the seller was US Military stationed somewhere in Alaska but the car was in storage in Chicago where the seller left it prior to being stationed in Alaska and had to sell the car because she was being deployed to overseas. The red herring to this is that the seller said their duty assignment in Chicago was Fort Dearborn.  Fort Dearborn was closed in the 1800’s. As this whole process started to stink I wrote and ask for the VIN and where exactly the car was in Chicago.  No response, and I don’t expect one.  To many conflicting stories, Dayton, Alaska, Chicago? Thank you so much for this website and blog. I found my deal of a lifetime on craigslist. Was almost caught with the amazon assurance scheme as I use amazon frequently. Fortunately I decided to do an online check on amazon safepay scams and found this site. Pretty much the same mode. Car is in Canada, owner has to return to duty in Korea. Thank you for this article my husband has just narrowly missed falling for this scam in the uk my gut instinct was to Google amazon payments and your article came up when we read it we had the exact email from the scammed thank you so much we nearly ruined our christmas My 2011 Volvo XC-90 3.2L V6 is still for sale. It has 108k miles, 3rd row seat. auto, clear title. The price was reduced at $4,500 as I need to sell it before February 19th, when I’ll be leaving with my unit Brigade Combat Team back to South Korea replacing the troops scheduled to come home. The deal includes free delivery as you may know we can ship a car/bike/etc from home to the base and back one time in a year for free. The vehicle will arrive at your address in 2 days so my presence it’s not necessary cause I have everything arranged with Amazon. You will have 5 days testing period before I receive any money and if by any reason you find something you don’t like about, you can send it back on my expense and you will receive a full refund of your money. It is located in Ft. HOOD, Texas. If you’re interested in purchasing it, all I need from you is your full name, phone# and shipping address and Amazon will contact you shortly after I forward them your contact details. . More photos at: http://imgur.com/a/YLeMO First of all you need to make the payment to Amazon Safepay, the funds will be placed on hold into their account. Then the shipping will start and the car will arrive at your location in max 48hrs. Then you will have 5 days testing period. If you will decide to keep the car, you should call Amazon to confirm them and they will release the funds to me. If not, you can ship it back, i will pay for the returning fees and you will get your money back in 12hrs. I hope you understand how it works. So if you wanna purchase my car, just get back to me with your full name, full shipping address and phone # and Amazon will send you the invoice.

I’m doing a special training program each day and I am not allowed to get out of the unit or give calls whenever I want. The delivery will take 2 to 3 days depending on your location and it’s not a problem because I can do it at no cost for you. Let me give you all the details about this purchase and how we can complete it through Fulfilled by Amazon. The payment is going to be sent to amazon fulfillment center, and they will hold and secure your money during the entire transaction. I repeat, they will hold and insure your money until receipt of the vehicle in good condition and will release the funds to me only after you decide to keep the vehicle and you register it, into your name. You will have an inspection period of 7 days. In this time you can check, test and inspect the vehicle. If by any reason (the vehicle has any hidden damages or is not like I describe it) you can reject the deal. In this case Amazon’s Fulfilling will refund you totally and they will deliver the vehicle back. Let me know your delivery details (your full name, full address and home phone number) so I can open a transaction case with Amazon’s Fulfilling and declare you as buyer. They will contact you with further information regarding payment and delivery but with no obligation to pay. So this is how mine went. I almost fell for it but my gut feel is tingling and my boyfriend told me its a scam. RED FLAG! Same as the others, she’s involved with military project and is moving to US for long term. I’ve read others’ as well and she uses same wording. Argh! Thank god! My scam email came from INVOICE@PAYMENTSONAMAZON.COM …similar military story – seller ‘deployed overseas.’ Instructions for completing the transaction came via PDF attached to the email — not a link to an Amazon webpage.
