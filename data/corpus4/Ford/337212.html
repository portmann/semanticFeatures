Valuing Ford: Disrupt Or Get Disrupted - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Record US car sales look to continue in the very near future. Autonomous vehicles will be a huge disruption to the auto industry. Ford (NYSE: F ) is part of the automotive manufacturing industry and this article is an analysis of the automobile industry, leading us to information that will be vital when forecasting future growth in our DCF analysis. The industry is involved in the design, production, marketing, sale, and servicing of motor vehicles. Most auto manufacturers currently produce compact cars, mid/full size sedans, SUVs, pick-ups, and luxury cars. Ford is involved in all of these categories, with their best known vehicle being the Ford F-150 pick-up truck. The industry's revenue streams come directly from vehicle production and sales volume and is based on the relationships between prices, sales mix, and volume. Sales mix is one of the most important things for the automobile manufacturers and Ford's profitability. On small, compact cars the margins that Ford and others make on the sale of these vehicles are very slim. Especially when compared to the margins that Ford realizes on trucks, SUVs, and luxury cars. Although government regulations are pushing manufacturers to have to sell more compact cars, which are low margin vehicles, the current state of the economy is pushing consumers towards bigger and less fuel efficient vehicles. This industry-wide trend bodes well for Ford's sales mix in the short-term, but in the long-term Ford and other competitors will need to be able to sell smaller, more efficient cars at higher margins to remain as profitable as they are today. Over the last year, consumers have been purchasing more cars than ever before. This can be explained for several reasons: low gas prices, low/nonexistent interest rates, and the old age of the "average car" being driven today. These are important trends for us to consider when we eventually forecast growth prospects in a future article as interest rates and gas prices will not be this low forever. In the US demand for vehicles has recovered over the most recent two years since the Financial Crisis and I expect for demand to grow slightly or remain steady over 2016. However, in the Asia-Pacific region of the world car demand will continue to grow because of the expanding middle class in these emerging markets. In 2015, this region obtained more than half of the world's car production and I see this trend continuing over the next three to five years. While China's GDP is starting to slow, it is still growing at a crazy rate of 7%, nearly triple that of the US. Expect Ford and competitors to fight intensely for market share in China. The market share Ford is able to capture in China could be the biggest catalyst for growth in the foreseeable future. Ford is leading the industry in the trend towards autonomous vehicles. Ford will have the largest autonomous fleet of the major auto manufacturers and plans to continue development of this industry changing technology. When analyzing how autonomous vehicles could change the future of the automobile industry we have to consider several different possibilities and factor these into our potential growth situations. Will the "sharing economy" become the norm when autonomous vehicles become popular? Will people consider a car as a "necessity" anymore? Or, will people still purchase cars as they recently have, they will simply have the autonomous feature? Will the first autonomous vehicle that is cleared for roadways be the biggest winner? You know the answer to these questions as well as I do, and nobody knows how it will play out, but it is something that we will need to account for when modeling Ford's growth into the future. I think that the threat of the "sharing economy" is the single, largest threat to Ford. With a large concentration on lowering carbon emissions, regulators around the world are making manufacturers sell a certain percentage of their vehicles as low-emission or even zero-emission. Since these cars are usually quite small, the margins on these vehicles are quite low. There is some regulation that will be slowly phased in over the next five to seven years in the US and Europe that will require Ford to have a sales mix that is skewed towards smaller and less profitable vehicles. Smaller countries are also starting to adopt regulations similar to the European Union and the US. If Ford and competitors cannot create higher margins on these low and zero-emission vehicles, expect a much lower return. While this may seem like quite negative trends for the automobile industry, I look at it as quite the opposite for Ford. Every negative has the potential to produce great growth for Ford. Imagine if Ford was the first to have a fully autonomous vehicle that was legal to buy and "drive" in the US or EU. Imagine if Ford was able to create a low-cost, high-margin low or zero emission vehicle that would be popular in the US, EU, and China. I think that we are coming to a point in the automobile industry that will be revolutionary. Maybe not tomorrow or two years from now, but definitely in the next 8-15 years. The manufacturers most willing to adopt new technologies and innovate the automobile will be winners in the next age of the automobile industry. This is the second part of doing a DCF analysis on the Ford Motor Company. Now that the more general analysis is over, I will begin working on analyzing Ford directly. I hope you all will continue to read my articles about Ford so that you all have a better understanding of Ford's value and where it comes from.
