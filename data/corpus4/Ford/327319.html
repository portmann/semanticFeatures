Ford's Dividend Payout - An Attractive Proposition - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford's stock price has been slammed down out of all proportion to its strong operational performance last year. What percentage of their free cash are they using to pay dividends? This metric is critical to understanding sustainability of payouts. Despite there being several areas where Ford still needs to rev up its engines, there's no denying that it is still an attractive investment. While I was researching material for my earlier article on GM's (NYSE: GM ) dividends, called GM: A Solid Dividend Play , I realized that I should extend it to their biggest competitor as well - Ford (NYSE: F ) - to see how they fared in terms of having the financial strength to keep up their dividends. The challenge, however, is this: dividend yield alone cannot be the only determining factor when buying a stock. The financial strength, current and future prospects of the company, their cash flow position, sheet strength and current dividend payout are all equally important in evaluating the sustainability of dividends into the future. In general, companies hate to cut their dividends, as it amounts to accepting their weakness to investors. They will typically pull out all stops to keep up with their dividend trajectory; and only when things turn really bad do they tend to cut back on dividends. For automakers, that happens only during a recession - or if a company makes a mess of its own. Take Volkswagen ( OTCPK:VLKAY ) as the perfect example of the latter; after the diesel emission scandal and the multibillion-dollar fines that came with it, the company was forced to make a dividend cut. Yet, even the beleaguered VW somehow managed to keep its dividend cut to eight cents for the year. Volkswagen Dividends (Source: Gurufocus ) Though Ford was not a beneficiary of a bailout at the height of the recession, it started paying dividends since 2012 - a full two years earlier than General Motors. Since then, it has steadily increased its dividends - from $0.05 in October 2012 to the current $0.15. During the recent quarter, Ford announced a special supplemental cash dividend of $1 billion , or 25 cents per share, possibly aimed at arresting the slide of its stock. Unfortunately, that didn't work out as planned. Ford's current payout ratio is 32.28%, which means the company is paying 32% of its earnings as dividend, so it would look like they have a lot more room to keep paying dividends at this level. Unfortunately, using net income to calculate payout ratio would be a horrible mistake for auto companies, since depreciation rates for capital-intensive businesses such as these run in the billions. The better metric to gauge the company's ability to keep paying dividends, therefore, is to find out how much free cash flow it uses to pay these dividends. The ideal percentage of free cash flow paid as dividends would be less than 50% , which means the company has plenty of room to move things around if needed, while keeping its dividend growth intact. From the table above it's clear that Ford has been staying within a 20-50% range since 2012, which means dividends aren't about to be cut in a hurry. Furthermore, Ford's cash flow from operations has steadily moved upwards since 2013, while capex - after moving up since 2012 - is showing some signs of reduction. On that, I should add that Ford intends to electrify up to 40% of its models by 2020, and this is backed by an investment of $4.5 billion. What that indicates is that they're not about to cut back on capital expenditure in any significant way. Again, as is the case with GM as outlined in my other article, the only chance for that to happen is if U.S. auto sales drop sharply - something we've already seen is merely a knee jerk reaction to what most assume is a peak in auto sales. Investor-speak: What is Ford's Stand on Dividends? As you can see from their current guidance, they're confident that their cash flow from operations will improve in 2016. What I think will happen is that Ford will see a way to increasing dividends this year in order to assuage investor fears and instill confidence that the company isn't going down the proverbial tubes. So, essentially, there are several factors that support the view that Ford will continue to pay dividends at current or higher than current levels over the next year and beyond. First, their payout ratio from net income is in the safe 30% range. Second, percentage of free cash flow as dividend is also in the sustainable range of 20-50%. Third, cash from operations grow stronger as capex holds steady. Put these factors together and what you have is solid financial performance from a company whose stocks make it look like the company is in trouble. In a recent article called Ford's Looming Tri-Mountain Challenge , I outlined three areas that Ford needs to look into to stay competitive in the market. Some readers misunderstood my intent and suggested that I was telling them what was wrong with Ford. I'll clarify that here: I think Ford is a great company with solid financials, and I stand by my analysis and outlook of the company. However, having said that, Ford does have to work harder in several areas like China and Europe, while keeping its lead in the United States. They also have to be prepared for an all-out EV war with GM when the time comes - whether that's in Europe or back at home. These numbers are critical to its bottom line, but they're also vital to the future growth of the company. For now, I'll say that Ford's dividends are safe, and it's a solid play if you want to get in at this price point and reap the benefits for several years to come.
