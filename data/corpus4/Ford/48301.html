Ford Motor: Let's Be Realistic Here, Ford's Positives Outweigh The Negatives By A Mile - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford Motor missed earnings expectations. South America and Europe continue to be a drag on Ford's earnings. 2015 will be the year in which Ford can prove what it is made of. One of the more frustrating things in 2014, if not the most frustrating, was that Ford Motor (NYSE: F ) disappointed my return expectations. In 2014, Ford Motor's stock returned merely half a percent thanks to a profit warning in September that hurt Ford Motor's valuation and investor sentiment. 2015, however, could be year in which Ford Motor rockets back to popularity: Job and economic growth is on a good track in the United States and auto companies could feel the love of consumers. Last week, Ford Motor reported earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2015, which missed earnings expectations, but were good nonetheless. In the first quarter, Ford said it had revenues of $31.8 billion, which compares against revenues of $33.9 billion in the year ago quarter. Net income was $924 million, $0.23 per share, compared against $1,019 million, $0.25 per share, in the year ago quarter. The Street expected earnings of $0.26 per share. Ford's first quarter earnings highlighted that the auto manufacturer continues to see challenges in South America and Europe. Economic headwinds in those geographies were also the reason why Ford Motor issued a profit warning last year. Ford's North American operations created a first quarter pre-tax profit of $1.34 billion, whereas South America lost $189 million and Europe lost $185 million. The Middle East/Africa and the Asia/Pacific region were marginally profitable. Source: Ford Motor Investor Relations On a consolidated basis, Ford's pre-tax earnings were at least solid, but I understand that investors are concerned about a more challenging environment in South America and Europe. However, operating margin and earnings trends in those two geographies are much more encouraging than first quarter results suggest. Ford's operating margin in South America was (12.5%) in 1Q 2015, a terrible margin by any measure, but much better than last year's (27%). On a pre-tax earnings basis, South America reduced its loss from $510 million last year to 'just' $189 million. South America is definitely good for negative earnings surprises in 2015, especially when it comes to volume growth and currency risk. Ford Europe did a little worse than last year: Ford's operating margin decreased from minus 2.5% last year to minus 2.7% this year while pre-tax earnings increased from $(194) million to $(185) million. Ford actually benefits from handsome sales growth and stable market share in Europe, which is why positive pre-tax earnings could be on the menu in 2015. The topic of valuation has already been talked to death. Ford Motor is in the bargain bin and nothing is going to change that: The auto manufacturer has an 8.5x forward P/E and a 0.4x sales ratio while offering a dividend yield of 3.80%. Enough said. Whether Ford Motor will be able to break out of its trading range and move to new highs in 2015 will depend on a number of things: A credible turnaround in South America and Europe, a successful F-150 production ramp-up, and high consumer spending. Right now, the positives (solid earnings in the United States, the F-150 truck launch, low valuation, high dividend) outweigh the negatives (currency tailwinds, local restructurings) by a mile. I am more comfortable than ever buying Ford Motor at just about $16. Long F.
