A Pragmatic Look At Facebook - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Young Americans remain hooked on the Facebook-Instagram duopoly. Organic investments + bold acquisitions = long-term growth potential. The following analysis provides a reasonable look at the strengths and weaknesses associated with Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ: FB ). Overall, I found plenty of bullish indicators. For example, according to the capital asset pricing model, the stock is currently trading at a steep discount to present value. In addition, growth is high, both in terms of users and revenue, margins are extraordinary, and necessary investments are being made to support the company's long-term success. On the other hand, however, I do not believe management has faced nearly enough scrutiny by investors regarding certain investments overseas, in particular, the initiative to bring Internet access to very remote populations. Whether Facebook should be worth ~$230 billion is ultimately up to you. My goal is to provide meaningful assistance in making that decision. It looks like momentum is building. With marketing expenditures now totaling as much as $1 trillion globally, Facebook is in a favorable position. The social media juggernaut recently posted $3.85 billion in quarterly revenue, beating analyst estimates of $3.78 billion and marking a 49% YOY gain. A significant proportion of this revenue was derived from mobile advertising - to be exact, 69% of total ad sales in the fourth quarter of 2014. Facebook's ultimate success still depends on the American youth. At its beginning, recall that the social network was made exclusive to college students - and with good reason. This group does, after all, represent the trendsetters of our society. They are the "cool" kids. The crowd with a knack for inspiring old and young alike to change their ways. Everyone else - annoying little brother, mom, dad, grandma, even the guy from Singapore - is merely a follower. As a result, the cultural hegemony of American twentysomethings, both at home and abroad, is not something to be taken lightly. Good thing the Facebook-Instagram duopoly remains their social media of choice. No other social networking site is a viable a threat. The closest alternative, Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ), almost looks like a joke in comparison. Who actually Tweets up-to-the-minute status updates about the most trivial of daily activities? That is largely a thing of the past for trendsetting 18-24 year olds. Instead, they prefer taking Instagram selfies and laughing at silly videos (or stories) shared on Facebook from around the Web. Investors can expect to see downward pressure on margins coming soon. Costs are continuing to grow, in particular for servers, storage, power, data centers, security systems, and talent to support anticipated future growth. In the meantime, Facebook is struggling to monetize emerging market users - the source of rising costs. In fact, a whopping 74 percent of revenue is generated in North America and Europe, where just 37 percent of users are located. In addition, at the expense of his shareholders, Zuckerberg remains hell-bent on providing Internet access to everything that breathes. Whether designing unmanned aircraft that can beam internet access down to people from the sky, or attempting to evangelize potential partners in the virtues of free connectivity, Mark seems determined to see this project to its end. He made it clear during a recent conference call . When confronted by an analyst on why investors should care about investments to connect African countries, the young CEO responded: "It matters to the kind of investors we want to have." Negative, Zuckerberg. You no longer run a private company. Like it or not, as Chief Executive and Chairman of the Board, you owe a fiduciary responsibility of long-term profit maximization to minority shareholders. And since users in emerging markets are already tough to monetize, I do not see profitability behind spending time and money provisioning Internet access in least developed countries. Investors need to beware the considerable variation in per capita income between emerging markets and least developed countries, the latter of which hold almost no potential to generate ad revenue. Before IT infrastructure can yield any real value for these parts of the world, they first need to develop sound political, legal, financial and energy infrastructures. If Mark really believes in the value of his cause, perhaps he should start a charitable foundation instead of being philanthropic with other people's money. To provide some benchmark comparisons, I compute key industry ratios from a group of 300-plus firms sorted by Open Systems Interconnection model communality. These companies, like Facebook, essentially provide a service to their users via the application layer of the OSI model. Some popular examples include, but of course are not limited to, Google, Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ), LinkedIn (NYSE: LNKD ), Twitter, Pandora (NYSE: P ) and Zillow (NASDAQ: Z ). Thus, we can think of this industry as "web applications." I choose to do it this way because, in my opinion, it is best to compare Internet companies relative to other Internet companies, as opposed to tech firms in general. According to my best estimate, Facebook is about 51% below the industry average trailing twelve month price/earnings. Because investors should prefer to pay less today for a dollar tomorrow, this is a good sign. However, despite impressive revenue growth, the company's price/sales ratio is still about 3x the average. Normally, this would be a major drawback. However, the reason investors are likely willing to pay more for lower revenue in the short-term is because they expect a major increase over the long-haul. Make of it what you will. Facebook yields a very unattractive price/book. According to my estimates, the company is currently about 56% above average. Not a good sign. Historically, firms with higher-than-average book-to-market ratios also provided higher-than-average returns. Research and development - key to the success of many technology companies - is apparently very important to Facebook as well. To that end, the firm devotes approximately 21% of sales vs. an industry average of roughly 14%. According to their most recent annual report, R&D increased almost three-fold to $1.1 billion in Q4. This capital mainly went toward accelerating development within its acquisitions, such as WhatsApp, Instagram and Oculus Rift. A smaller portion also was used to improve in-house messaging products and video services. However, to consider R&D on its own could be misleading. If the goal is to determine the degree to which management upholds a long-term outlook, then we really need to look at the reinvestment rate - which accounts for acquisitions in addition to R&D. Reinvestment rate = (net capital expenditures + change in WC) / EBIT (1-t) I calculate the reinvestment rate for all tech companies by first subtracting R&D from operating costs and then adding it back to capital expenditures on the statement of cash flows. It makes intuitive sense. Why should R&D - which yields a future cash flow just like any other investment - be classified in the same boat as overhead expenses? Facebook's reinvestment rate, like R&D/sales, comes in well-above average. Management is obviously very confident about the firm's long-term prospects. According to the annual report, cash used in investing activities during 2014 primarily resulted from $4.98 billion for the acquisition of businesses and $1.83 billion for capital expenditures related to network infrastructure and the construction of data centers and office buildings. Even in the face of a bold investment regime, Facebook's leverage is below average. On its face, this might be puzzling, especially given a reinvestment rate almost 2x earnings. Just remember that acquisitions - a large component of the reinvestment rate - are mostly paid for by issuing stock. In that sense, equity for a high-growth firm like Facebook also serves as a form of currency, whereby issuing more of it can raise the reinvestment rate to multiple times earnings. Margins are definitely attractive. However, as previously noted, these are likely to decline a bit going forward - especially the operating margin. Supporting more growth will come with higher costs overall. In the grand scheme of things, there are only two things investors should care about: 1. How much a stock is fundamentally worth. 2. How much it currently trades for. A good way to determine how much you should be willing to give up today in exchange for a dollar in the future is via discounted cash flow analysis. Following this logic, assume the discounted present value of Facebook can be defined by the following: n = the number of holding periods, which in our case is one year The tricky part is coming up with a required rate of return. There are quite a few ways to do so. For simplicity, let's use the capital asset pricing model, which is defined by the following equation: E(Ri) = Expected return on the individual asset Rf = Return on a risk-free asset, such as Treasury securities To calculate Rm - Rf (market risk premium), I took the total return of S&P firms (dividends + capital gains) minus the total return on the compounded value of $100 invested in a 10-year Treasury bond at the beginning of 2014. It would be inappropriate to only take the logarithmic return on the S&P, as I am sure many people do, when calculating returns. Likewise, although the average interest on a 10-year Treasury was roughly 2.5% during 2014, it actually yielded, as a result of increased demand, closer to 5% when accounting for capital appreciation attributable to those holding the asset from the beginning to end of the year. Thus, I came up with the following: Note that there are limitations to my chosen approach for calculating risk-free rates. For instance, rates on long-dated Treasury bonds likely yield a slight premium to compensate for duration risk. Also keep in mind that we are attempting to estimate how much something is worth in the future using data from last year. There is a slim chance, for example, that interest rates going forward will decline and lead to substantial risk-free gains, as happened in previous years. Moreover, this assumption is consistent with Malkiel's Fifth Theorem, which dictates that the magnitude of a price increase caused by a decrease in yield is greater than a price decrease caused by an increase in yield. Taken together, I suggest we use an 8%, as opposed to 9%, required rate of return as the best approximation. Discounting the $95 one-year price target at 8% yields a present value of approximately $87.96 per share. Consequently, numerous implications can be drawn. First, investors should be willing to buy at any price below $87.96. This is because anything yielded from today's price up to $87.96 would represent an asymmetric reward. Likewise, any gain as a result of holding from $87.96 to the one-year price target of $95 would just be compensation for risk. Secondly, no one should be willing to pay more than $87.96. All of this is obviously very subjective, so feel free to adjust the price target as you see fit. However, even going with an extremely conservative $92 price target, discounted present value still comes in at $85.19, exceeding today's market price. I recommend against messing with the discount rate too much. Facebook is trading far below its discounted present value. As a result, therein lay the possibility of an asymmetric reward. Investors also must seriously consider the long-term prospects of the company. In that regard, there are many bright spots. Necessary investments are being made - both organically and through acquisitions - to ensure the company's long-term survival. Furthermore, the social media conglomerate has no real competition. Young Americans are still hooked, both on Facebook and, increasingly, Instagram. What's not to like?
