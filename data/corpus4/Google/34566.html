Yahoo's Outlook Was Solid, Anticipate Upside From Mobile Search - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha While earnings figures missed expectations, I see reasonable upside in its MAVENs business. Pricing trends are starting to stabilize, and audience statistics are starting to trend higher, particularly in mobile search. The mobile business will drive a respectable growth rate in both earnings and sales over the foreseeable five-year period. The core business is extremely undervalued, and some of its core investments, i.e. Alibaba and Yahoo Japan, put a firm floor beneath the stock price. Yahoo's (NASDAQ: YHOO ) EPS and top line missed consensus analyst expectations . While the company doesn't always have a great track record when it comes to earnings announcements, the business is starting to show positive signs of life, particularly in the MAVENs (mobile, video, native advertising and social) segment. Also, the stock is extremely undervalued on a sum-of-the-parts basis. The core business is cheap and has reasonable growth prospects; therefore, I continue to reiterate my positive stance on the company. When looking at the first-quarter highlights, I'd have to say the most pertinent information comes from the MAVENs segment, which combines the revenue from mobile, video, native and social ads. These ads are extremely important, as mobile is a growing platform that has size constraints (it's really hard to advertise on 5- to 6-inch screens). On the other hand, mobile has high levels of engagement, as indicated by Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) and Twitter's (NYSE: TWTR ) gangbuster growth. Yahoo needed a mobile strategy for quite a while, as various market forecasts indicate that more and more ad revenue will be driven by native mobile ads over all other formats. Assuming this side of the business continues to scale and grow at quite a considerable rate, the company should be able to stabilize its growth trajectory to a respectable mid-teen growth rate. The company has re-outfitted a variety of its services with new features, which puts it down the glide path of becoming a tech company rather than a media property. This approach is very different from what prior CEOs have had. Admittedly, not everything about Marissa Mayer's approach is attractive, as various fund managers and analysts have complained about her micro-management and lack of communication. Also, high turnover at the upper levels of management have put a strain on long-term strategic planning, as many of the prior executives weren't given enough time to put into effect a turnaround at the company. This is why Yahoo looked clueless when all the major social and search platforms migrated to mobile. However, the company isn't a sinking boat yet, and promising data in its core business gives me reasonable suspicion that the stock will likely outperform post spin-off of the Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) holding company. This is because the PC ad-business has shown signs of stabilization following the recent Mozilla Firefox deal. In Q4 2014, Yahoo Mobile Search had 50% share of search traffic, according to eMarketer. What's surprising is that Google's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) foothold in desktop search isn't transitioning to mobile search as effectively, which indicates that Yahoo may gain back some of its lost momentum as a search provider if it focuses more of its energy on developing the mobile side of its business. Furthermore, impression trends are starting to improve, which has offset the decline in pricing for the first time. Global search increased paid clicks by 21% and increased pricing by 3%. The display business on the other hand has increased ads sold by 29%, offsetting a 17% reduction in CPMs. Yahoo reported Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $0.15, which missed consensus analyst estimates by $0.03. The company reported revenue of $1.04 billion (-4.6% year-over-year), revenue missed by $20 million. The shares are starting to move higher in the after-hours, as outlook and improvements in the core business offset the disappointing results. Also, commentary on its Japanese stake and its exploration of options with regards to some of its other core assets has intrigued investors in the after-hours. The Q2'15 GAAP revenue outlook of $1.23 billion indicates that there will be some year-over-year growth. This is driven by the MAVENs revenue ramp paired with stabilization in desktop ads. So it's a little easier to make a prediction on sales going forward. I'm starting to warm up to the idea of owning Yahoo following the spin-off of core assets. An apt comparison of Yahoo to Google is perhaps the showdown of Chris Weidman, prior to him knocking out Anderson Silva at UFC 168. Many thought Weidman was the underdog, as Silva developed a track record of being the best "pound for pound fighter in the world." In other words, investing into Yahoo is driven by whether Yahoo can sustain search query share in mobile search. Assuming, Yahoo can supplant some of Google's dominance in search, especially on the mobile side, mobile ad growth is the next logical outcome. Therefore, I reiterate my positive stance on the stock. I don't really have a price target in mind, but may offer one in a future article.
