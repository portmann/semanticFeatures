Alphabet Needs Chromecast To Increase Its Advertising Audience - Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) | Seeking Alpha The humble $35 Chromecast is beating Roku and Apple’s more expensive streaming video products. Strategy Analytics Q3 2015 report revealed Alphabet’s Chromecast is the world’s top-selling streaming video device. The living room TV is an important conduit for targeted advertising. Amazon’s ban of the Chromecast will affect sales, but Google’s streaming product already has an insurmountable market lead. There is no update yet on Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) $50 Android phone ambitions. Therefore, I will report that Alphabet's other dirt-cheap product, the $35 Chromecast, is super-successful in the streaming devices industry. Because the $50 Android One project is unlikely to happen soon, the Chromecast is the mass market product that can help Alphabet further increase its audience for targeted ads. People who still cling to their dumb HDTVs are potential customers for the Chromecast. Alphabet believes in the Chromecast. It has allocated a budget to create promotional video ads for the Chromecast. While there are now Android TV boxes and full-sized smart TV products, the Chromecast caters to the sector that still doesn't want a $100 Android TV Box or a $500 Android smart TV. The average TV product cycle is also seven years. The Chromecast is an easy, cheap upgrade option for people who have 2012-era Android 4.0 smart TVs that are no longer powerful enough to run modern Android apps and games. The app-friendly feature of the Chromecast keeps it popular among consumers. As per the Q3 report of Strategy Analytics, the Google Chromecast is the runaway leader in global sales of streaming video/TV products. The Google Chromecast now touts 35% market share of the 52.7 million units (18% YoY higher than Q3 2014) of streaming products sold in Q3 2015. Launched only in 2013, the Chromecast now enjoys a significant lead over the Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) TV, Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Fire TV, and Roku. The Chromecast helped contribute to the notable decline of Apple TV. Strategy Analytics' Q2 2014 report last year gave the Apple TV a 30% market share . Apple's TV box now only has 20% share. The new $149 Apple TV 4 will not help Apple catch up with the new $35 Chromecast 2015 version. Like the latest Apple TV iteration, the second-generation Chromecast's biggest selling point is its apps/gaming compatibility. While the new Chromecast still doesn't come with a dedicated game controller, Android phones and tablets (which most people already own) serve as game controllers. Alphabet has improved the wireless connectivity of the 2015 Chromecast. It now has three, instead of one, multi-directional Wi-Fi antennas. It means it has better WiFi speed for latency-free video streaming and gaming. Alphabet sold more than 20 million units of the original Chromecast. I expect the improved 2015 version to do better because this product is affordable enough even for people in emerging markets. Alphabet launched the Chromecast 2015 in 17 countries and it still retains the $35 price tag of the original version. The 2015 Chromecast is now even available here in the Philippines for $63.30 (due to import taxes/dealer mark-up). Even people with older Android smart TV products are potential customers of the 2015 Chromecast. The better hardware specs of the Chromecast gives a new lease on life to older Android TVs. I have a three-year old Android 4.0 32-inch Smart TV. It only has 256MB of RAM and 1GB of ROM, which makes it unfit for news apps or gaming. The Chromecast 2015 has 4GB of RAM, 2GB of ROM, and a dual-core processor. it could meet the exacting hardware requirements of new apps. It's also more than just an internet-to-TV gadget. It has the essential hardware to really make mini-computers out of HDMI-equipped TV sets. Thanks to Google Cast , the Android, iOS and web versions of Polaris Office allow the $35 Chromecast to be used as a school/office productivity tool. This is another advantage of Chromecast over the Apple TV 4 - Google's product is compatible with iOS and Android apps. Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X computers that use the Chrome browser also has web-based apps that really give Chromecast owners access to thousands of apps/games. Since the Chromecast device is so affordable, its sales will continue to surge. Consequently, app developers who want to monetize more users will have to support Google Cast to access the advertising eyeballs of Chromecast users. The more apps/games that are made compatible with Google Cast, the more people will be inspired to buy the $35 Chromecast product. The Chromecast is a long-term vehicle for Alphabet's digital advertising business. It also assists Alphabet's movies for rent and for sale business. The Chromecast also helps Alphabet attract more households to subscribe to its new premium subscription-only YouTube Red service. The rise of ad-blocking on desktop computers requires Alphabet to find new advertising eyeballs among home TV-only users. Google Play's Movie business is still weaker than iTunes Store and Amazon's mobile on-demand video streaming services. The more Chromecast users there are, the better chances that more people will buy/rent a movie from Google Movies. As long as there is a $35 Chromecast, Apple will find it hard to disseminate enough TV boxes to lay the groundwork for its ambitious streaming video/TV service for 2016. Anything that hurts the expansion plans of Apple is good for Alphabet. Yes, Amazon's ban of the Chromecast will still hurt future sales of the Chromecast. However, there are other online stores that Amazon customers could use to buy the Chromecast this holiday season. Furthermore, the Chromecast has 35% global market share while the Fire TV only has 16%. It will take more than a ban from Amazon before the Fire TV Stick could catch up with the Chromecast. Just Like Roku's streaming products, the Amazon Fire TV is not yet available in many countries. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
