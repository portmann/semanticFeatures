Apple Pay To Include Store Credit, Rewards Cards â€“ Consumerist Apple Pay is expanding its usability beyond just your bank-issued debit and credit cards. Today, the company announced that the payment platform will soon include the ability to pay with some store-branded credit cards and for users to access certain store rewards cards. The update was announced at Apple’s annual Worldwide Developers Conference, where the company said that Kohl’s, JCPenney, and BJ’s will be among the first to have their store-branded cards on Apple Pay after the new iOS 9 rolls out to devices. Also allowed will be rewards programs from participating retailers. Apple showed off Walgreens Balance Rewards and Dunkin Donuts’ DD Perks cards, which users will no longer need to carry around in their wallets. Speaking of wallets, Apple’s “Passbook” functionality that keeps all these cards in order is going to be renamed “Wallet,” which surely raised more than a few eyebrows at Google, operator of the Google Wallet payment platform. « Hairless Cat Missing In Atlanta Airport Found Alive And Safe Raiders Of The Lost Walmart Find Ancient And Mysterious Feature Phone Consumerist is currently testing a new user experience.
