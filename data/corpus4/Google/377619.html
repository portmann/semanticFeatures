XLK Being Dragged By Apple As New Threat Emerges - Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEARCA:XLK) | Seeking Alpha XLK has been on a sharp rebound since plunging to the February 11th low. Apple has been dragged down by a new threat, the DOJ’s demands to help hack the iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino terrorist attackers. XLK’s four largest holdings, AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT and FB, should move higher, despite the global slowdown and strengthening dollar. If the dark cloud over Apple from the DOJ threat was excluded, our estimation has shown that XLK would be even higher. The Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEARCA: XLK ), which tracks the S&P 500 Information Technology Select Index (NYSE:IXT), has been on a sharp rebound since plunging to the February 11th low of $38.25 per share, when Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen told the U.S. Congress on the second day of her two-day semiannual monetary policy report that overseas weakness and market distress could threaten the Fed's plans to raise the rate, but didn't explicitly mention any delays to interest rate hikes. XLK is about to break out and retest the all-time high, despite concerns about the global economic slowdown and strengthening dollar, as the Technology has the largest overseas earnings and the most dollar exposure of all the S&P sectors. A new threat for Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), the top holding of XLK, emerged in February after Apple received a court order directing them to help the FBI break into the iPhone used by one of perpetrators of the San Bernardino terrorist attack last year. Apple is refusing to comply. In fact, public attention has been diverted from the deadliest terrorist attack on American soil to Apple, and the government's claims of obstructing the Federal criminal investigation. In the middle of the heated debate, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump jumped onto the band wagon and called for a boycott of all Apple products in light of the company's reluctance to help authorities hack into the iPhone in question. If the dark cloud over Apple shares from this new threat was excluded, our estimation has shown that XLK would have closed between $44.33 and $49.80 per share today, instead of $42.99 per share. Apple and DOJ Threat - According to Zacks , the Department of Justice, or DOJ, argued that the case isn't about creating a backdoor for circumventing iOS 9 encryption and security, but merely requests the unlocking of one specific iPhone used by the perpetrator in the San Bernardino terrorist attack. If Apple doesn't comply, the DOJ could demand that Apple turn over its iPhone software "source code" along with the encrypted "signing key". With the source code and private encryption keys, the FBI would have enough power to develop its own software, which could become an effective tool to track people. Apple plans to appeal and the appeals process could very well go all the way to the Supreme Court, and drag on for years after President Obama leaves office. Alphabet Inc, Class A (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Class C (NASDAQ: GOOG ), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT ), and Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) are now joining the fight against the DOJ as each of these firms has already filed an amicus curiae (friend of the court) brief in support of Apple's defense. Fundamental and Technical Overview - About 41% of the holdings in XLK are the four mega cap computer hardware, search engine, software, social media and networking companies, Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc, Microsoft Corp and Facebook Inc, with a combined market cap of over $1.8 trillion, as of March 15. Technically, XLK has been moving in bearish reverse symmetrical triangle chart patterns since late 2014. XLK sold off earlier in January and made a double bottom at the $38.25 per share level in February. The ETF is now retesting the head resistance at the $43 level and is about to break out. A breakout could take XLK to $44 and $45, or the upper trendline resistances of the reverse symmetrical triangle chart patterns. XLK is now trading about 3.22% off the 52-week high of $44.42 per share. The 5-year return for XLK is 85.9%, as of March 15. Apple - As of March 15, Apple has a weight of 14.11% in XLK and a 5-year return of 128.91%. Apple announced mixed results for their fiscal 2016 first-quarter , ended December 26, 2015, as its revenues came in below consensus estimates and earnings were in line with expectations. The company warned Wall Street during its earnings call that iPhone sales could be soft in the March quarter, due to a slowing smartphone market and the wider global economic downturn. In our technical viewpoint, shares of AAPL have been trading in a bullish descending wedge chart pattern since the end of 2014. A bearish head and shoulders chart pattern also emerged within the descending wedge chart pattern, with a neckline between the $100.77 and $102.32 levels. The stock broke through the neckline earlier in January, along with the broader market, and bounced off the technical resistances between $92.00 and $93.68 in late January. AAPL broke out the neckline of the head and shoulders to the upside today, after Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty said in her report that it sees "surprising upside" to iPhone demand. The stock could carry momentum and head to a descending wedge breakout at around the $107.25 level. AAPL shares are currently trading about 21% off the 52-week high of $132.09 per share. Alphabet - Alphabet, both class A and class C shares, has a total weight of 10.53% in XLK and a 5-year return of 163.61%, as of March 15. Google's parent company Alphabet, reported good results for the fourth-quarter 2015, as the company beat both top and bottom lines. Google's reliance on the revenue of its websites is still very high. While the cost-per-click, or CPC, was down, the paid clicks were up as the company is shifting from the desktop to a mobile platform. Google said its "Other Bets" revenue, which includes moonshots like self-driving cars, was $448 million with operating losses of $3.56 billion. Technically, an ascending wedge chart pattern for GOOGL has emerged since mid-2015. The stock soared to an all-time high of $810.35 in February, after the company released their better-than-expected fourth-quarter 2015 earnings report. Since then, GOOGL shares have pulled back and consolidated along the lower trendline resistance of the ascending wedge chart pattern. GOOGL could be heading to retest the $800 level, as Wall Street believes secular growth and underlying fundamentals remain solid. The stock is currently traded about 7% off its 52-week, or all-time high. Microsoft - As of March 15, Microsoft has a total weight of 10.36% in XLK and a 5-year return of 142.55%. Microsoft announced solid fiscal 2016 second-quarter results , ended December 26, 2015, that beat both the top and bottom lines. The commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate exceeded $9.4 billion in the last quarter, but Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN ) AWS remains the leader, with Microsoft in second place in the cloud IT infrastructure market. The company said businesses are piloting Windows 10, which will drive deployments beyond 200 million active devices. Revenue in More Personal Computing declined 5%, but Surface revenue surged 29%, driven by the Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book. From our technical viewpoint, MSFT shares broke out the head resistance at $48.25 per share and surged to an all-time high of $56.44 per share in late 2015. The stock has been trading between $56 and $48.25 per share, as a symmetrical triangle chart pattern has emerged. As Wall Street is bullish about the stock, MSFT could break out the upper trendline resistance and head to its all-time high. The stock is currently traded about 5% off the 52-week high, or all-time high. Facebook - Facebook has a total weight of 588% in XLK and a return of 191.24% since its IPO on June 18, 2012, compared to a 66.47% return for XLK during the same period. Facebook's results for fourth-quarter 2015 topped Wall Street's estimates of both the top and bottom lines. The company said its total monthly active users, or MAUs, registered at about 1.59 billion by the end of the quarter, while more than 90% of both monthly and daily active users were on mobile. Technically, FB shares have been moving in an uptrend channel since the beginning of 2014. The stock started to break out in mid-2015 and an ascending wedge chart pattern has emerged. FB is bumping into a key technical head resistance at the $110.65 level, and the upper trendline resistance of the ascending wedge chart pattern. Wall Street is very bullish on Facebook and the stock will most likely break out to retest the all-time high at $117.59 per share. FB shares are currently traded about 6% off the 52-week high, or all-time high. Conclusions - XLK, the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF, has been on a sharp rebound since plunging to the February 11th low, but have nonetheless been dragged down by a new threat to Apple, that being the DOJ's demands that Apple help the FBI break into the iPhone used by one of perpetrators of the San Bernardino terrorist attack last year. Although shares of the four largest holdings of XLK, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft and Facebook, are all currently trading below their 52-week or all-time highs, they should move higher based on fundamentals and good earnings outlooks, despite the global slowdown and strengthening dollar. XLK is about to break out and retest its all-time high. If the dark cloud over Apple from the DOJ threat was excluded, our estimation has shown that the XLK would be even higher.
