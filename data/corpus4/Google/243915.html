Will GM Or Ford Launch A Direct Uber Competitor? - General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) | Seeking Alpha Nov. 22, 2015 11:33 AM ET  |  About: General Motors Company (GM) , F , UBER , Includes: AAPL , GOOG , GOOGL , HMC , NSANY , TM , TSLA , VLKAF , VLKAY by: Anton Wahlman GM, and perhaps Ford, could have the capacity to show an internal Uber competitor within months, and launch service by the end of 2017. New younger management at GM and Ford see the high valuations of next-gen taxi companies (such as Uber), and want some of that. GM and Ford are embedding 4G LTE connectivity in their cars, and would benefit from a higher market share in shared taxi services. I list the reasons why the other major automakers are less likely to offer Uber-style taxi services at this kind of scale, in this timeframe. GM CEO Mary Barra is giving the keynote presentation at the 2015 Consumer Electronics Show, and perhaps the Chevy Bolt wonâ€™t be the sole highlight. There is a long list of reasons why I expect GM (NYSE: GM ) and/or Ford (NYSE: F ) to launch direct Uber (Pending: UBER ) competitors starting already in the next two years. Let's dive right into it. The automobile industry as a whole is one of low profitability, over a decade-long, up-and-down cycle. We are now close to what could be the peak of a cycle, and many automakers are operating in mid-single digit net margins. When times eventually turn south, losses are almost guaranteed. This is so because the automobile industry, as we have known it for almost 100 years, has become increasingly competitive, with new brands such as Hyundai and Kia having entered the US market over the last 25 years. The future looks even bleaker given that we are just now starting to see Chinese-made cars arriving in US dealerships, and new Chinese-owned automakers setting up shop on US soil. With these low margins and a muted industry growth rate over a ten-year cycle, multiples on sales and profits are naturally also low. Ford and GM have almost identical market caps right now ($58 billion and $56 billion), as well as almost identical revenue at just a hair above $150 billion a year. The trailing P/S ratio on both companies is right around 0.37 - an extremely low number by almost any comparison, reflecting low net margins. The latest auto industry bogeyman (for sales and profitability) is shared mobility, with privately held Uber being the poster child. The idea is that fewer cars will be sold, partially offset by those fewer cars having a higher utilization ratio and therefore needing more frequent replacement and service events. Being privately held, Uber doesn't disclose financials, so we're left with much speculation, sometimes heavily conflicting such. One report suggested $415 million in revenue and $470 million in operating losses, based on allegedly leaked documents . It would have to be off by a lot to come even close to justify a total company value, which now is said to be between $51 billion and $70 billion, or similar to GM and Ford. Then there's Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ), which has a fully diluted market cap of $33 billion (150 million shares multiplied by $220), but lost $230 million last quarter, so on an annualized basis almost $1 billion. GAAP revenue was $937 million, so close to $4 billion annualized, although growing fast. At the P/S ratio awarded to Ford and GM, Tesla would be worth barely $1 billion, not $33 billion. One of the factors behind Tesla's market cap holding around the same level as during the average of the last 22 months, despite worsening bottom-line losses and cash burn, is the talk that started in early August on the subject of Tesla offering an Uber-like car sharing service. The possibility was raised by Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas on the two most recent quarterly conference calls, in what sounded like a pre-arranged staged Q&A in which Tesla could make people believe something without having to say it, offering the equivalent of "no comment." The exchange sounded like someone had been inspired by the famous "B3 bomber" scene in "Wag The Dog" (1997). Regardless of how the discussion came about, it's pretty clear that Wall Street has viewed the optionality surrounding the possibility that Tesla could launch an Uber-like service as a positive, helping cushion the other negative trends in net income and cash burn. The fact that the idea is that Tesla's taxi service would be fed with driverless cars is a whole other matter: Good luck making that happen within the next decade or two. Unlike Tesla, GM and Ford could launch this kind of a service at huge scale already in 2016-2017, instead of waiting somewhere between a decade and forever for driverless cars. But it's not just Uber and the speculation about Tesla's taxi plans. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) may also enter the car business in taxi-service form, and there is already speculation about the intentions of privately-held (Chinese LeTV) Faraday Future, which will show its first vehicle in early 2016. You can see the issue here, as far as Ford and GM are concerned: Companies such as Uber and Tesla are being awarded huge valuations based in whole or in part on new forms of taxi services, and Google and Apple may not be too many years behind. At the same time, GM and Ford move metal down assembly lines to the tune of 0.37 P/S ratios - just like they've been doing for close to 100 years. The First Step: GM and Ford Prepare for Ubiquitous Connectivity Two years ago, GM started down the path of offering embedded 4G LTE in its cars. That transformation is now largely complete, with almost 100% of GM vehicles sold today having it as standard. When this happened, I thought that one useful app for this functionality was that you could build in an Uber driver's app into the GM cars, so that you would get a better and more reliable experience than having the Uber driver's app running on a separate smartphone. Well, I don't think I was thinking big enough. Instead of just enabling Uber to optimize for GM cars, why not integrate forward, vertically, into offering the entire taxi service yourself? If a company such as Uber is getting a valuation exceeding $50 billion for offering this kind of service, why couldn't GM do the same and double its market cap? As for Ford, it just announced days ago that it too is now starting to roll out embedded 4G LTE in their cars, copying GM with a two-year lag. The first vehicle is the 2017 Ford Escape, which goes into production in early 2016. Through October 2015, Ford sold 257,731 Escapes in the US, making it their best-selling vehicle in the US after the F-series, so they are not kidding around with a low-volume model to start. What advantages would a car company such as GM or Ford have in doing what Uber does? Why not leave Uber alone, especially if they are losing money? The first reason GM and Ford would like to compete with Uber is that despite unproven financials, at least the private market values this service. In Tesla's case, there are probably a few billion dollars baked into its $33 billion market cap based on the prospects of offering an Uber-style service some time several years down the road. A higher market cap means that you can raise money on more favorable terms, perhaps replace debt with equity, and offer better terms to the best human resources talent. That's why a market cap can at least in part be a self-fulfilling prophecy. As for the business operations themselves, you could imagine that GM or Ford would have these advantages: The benefit of an embedded app in the car's infotainment system, that's more persistent and more precise than a separate smartphone app. It would also be integrated with more of the vehicle's functions, unlike a separate smartphone app, which would give GM/Ford more ability to optimize the service and vehicle efficiency. Real-time knowledge of where all of the cars are, as a service of this kind would require an "opt-in" enabling live location monitoring. Ability to share in revenue and profits, if any. Sell more cars. If the automaker doesn't control the service, the drivers will use cars from all other competing brands. This prevents that, and is probably the second most important rationale for getting into the taxi service business, after the market cap impact. Generate volume and better terms for and through the automaker's own financing arm. The automaker could offer the driver a "complete package" of car, ride-sharing service and financing without any middleman, whether in the form of Uber or some other aggregator. For these reasons, a GM or Ford might be able to generate a profit from an Uber-style taxi service, whereas Uber itself might not. That also leads us into some other considerations as to the stock market reaction to Ford or GM announcing a direct Uber competitor. On the plus side, the thematic investor sentiment appears to be very positive, and would likely favor such an initiative. If the service was profitable - and more profitable than the traditional car business - it would help the stock not just in the short run, but also in the long run. On the negative side, if this taxi business turns out to be unprofitable - or even yielding a lower return on investment than the traditional car business - it would reduce future earnings for GM or Ford, and then most likely be bad for the stock longer term, even if there would be an initial boost. This latter sentiment has also been discussed by Bob Lutz, who recently suggested that the car business would turn into a financial quagmire, with Apple losing $30 billion in the process: He said that this would be bad for Apple shareholders. One more reason why GM and Ford would now be more open to a new business model of this nature has to do with management. The old managements who ran GM before the bankruptcy, and Ford before Alan Mulally, were much different than the new regimes. You wouldn't necessarily notice it from the resumes. The new CEOs from Ford and GM started working there in 1989 and 1980, respectively. However, if you have been paying any attention at all to what these two new CEOs have been doing since 2014, you would know that things are managed very differently now. They may be Detroit lifers, but there is new blood in the innovation genes. For example, Ford opened up a significant Silicon Valley R&D office and introduced major initiatives in multi-modal (the new buzzword) transportation technology last June. Further enlightenment is probably also infused from the retired Ford CEO's subsequent board seat at Google. Another Ford alumnus, John Krafcik, recently joined Google as head of its car business, whose long-term intentions are largely unknown, but Ford might be well-advised to fear the worst. Think about it: Ford's most prominent alumni are at Google, which has a $516 billion market cap, almost 10x Ford's. Tesla has a $33 billion market cap with tiny revenue and no profits. Uber has a valuation of $51 billion to $70 billion. Apple has $200 billion in cash on hand and will spend some of it developing a family of cars. As the new Ford CEO, this has to make you feel nervous and make you open to radical new ideas. At GM, many of the same motivations apply, but in addition consider this: For the first time ever, CEO Mary Barra will keynote this year's Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in early January. We already know that the final production version of the $30,000, 200-mile range Chevrolet Bolt will be shown, but could there be something else too? Perhaps demoing a fully-fledged Uber competitor? The final question you might ask is this: Why GM and Ford, instead of the other major automakers? The answer really comes down to specific circumstances and personalities. I already described above a plausible scenario of why GM and Ford may be highly motivated. But what about the other automakers? I don't see the other automakers having the vision, product portfolio, geographic fit or cultural openness right now, to launch a multi-billion dollar Uber competitor effort, especially in the US: Fiat-Chrysler (NYSE: FCAU ): Really? It has not even been able to launch Apple CarPlay or Android Auto. Sergio Marchionne may be the brightest renaissance man in the auto industry, but does anyone see him or the Agnelli ownership family going after Uber? Volkswagen ( OTCQX:VLKAY ) ( OTCQX:VLKAF ): I actually see Audi, VW and Porsche as some of the most progressive in the business. However, they are based in Europe, and they have another (diesel) problem that is consuming management's attention right now. In addition, they are focused on their 20 (yes, twenty) new plug-in electric cars that they are developing to hit the market over the next five years in their attempt to wrestle EV leadership away from Nissan. Daimler/Mercedes: Already extremely profitable, and with a focus on luxury cars and trucks, probably not the highest motivation to compete with Uber in the US. BMW ( OTCPK:BAMXY ): Certainly one of the very most progressive automakers (i3 carbon fiber and production process) in the world. It also offers a rental car business already. However, would it be willing to offer a taxi service on this kind of scale? It just pulled its rental car business out of San Francisco. Toyota (NYSE: TM ): The world's largest and most profitable automaker, it should be in a better position than anyone. However, it is also extremely conservative, and has done nothing with Android Auto or Apple CarPlay yet. Its cars don't have embedded 4G LTE. I just don't see any signs that it will have the guts to launch a taxi service of this scale. Perhaps this will change if GM and/or Ford lead the way. Nissan ( OTCPK:NSANY ): A little bit like Fiat-Chrysler in terms of a strong leader, except the company is more successful financially. It also is already the leader in electric cars to date, so that is a bigger focus for Nissan, near-term. Honda (NYSE: HMC ): Also has a new CEO, and is moving quickly with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. However, I don't see any signs yet that it has the guts to undertake an offering of this scale, especially not in the US. Again, this could change if another company such as GM and Ford end up leading the way. Hyundai/Kia: One of the "hungriest" automakers, and one of the most successful in recent years, it could be open to new avenues of revenue and profit. However, Hyundai/Kia tends to also focus on proven profit models, and simply perfecting them with "best in class" engineering and then offering it at the lowest price. Hyundai/Kia would likely prefer other companies experiment with completely unproven business models, before jumping in. Among the largest automakers, the leaves us with the two automakers who now have the greatest motivation and new, fresh, hungry and innovative management culture to compete with Uber: GM and Ford. Conventional wisdom - to the extent that any such exists at this nascent stage - might indicate that Ford is more likely than GM. Ford has recently shown lots of experimentation in multi-modal transportation technologies in a very open way, including its new major R&D center in Silicon Valley. Those could lead to Ford becoming Uber's new competitor in 2017. However, I think that in this case, GM may be more likely to move even faster than Ford. GM is showing new innovative marketing leading up to the launch of the upcoming Chevrolet Bolt, and Mary Barra is giving the CES keynote speech. This would build on GM having seeded its new car sales over the last year, with 4G LTE standard in every car, as the ultimate Trojan Horse to the tune of millions of cars at scale. It would be a seminal moment for GM to trump them all -- Uber, Tesla, Google, Apple and Ford. If I'm right, is this the time to buy GM stock? Ford too?
