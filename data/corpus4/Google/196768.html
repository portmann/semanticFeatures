Starbucks, KFC, Chili’s, And Delta Start Accepting Apple Pay For Almost No One To Use â€“ Consumerist Whoops! It looks like portions of our site are being blocked!

Click to print (Opens in new window) Mobile wallets still aren’t catching on with Americans , even a year after the introduction of Apple Pay and a month after the introduction of Android Pay. There are hundreds of millions of capable phones in consumers’ purses and pockets, so it’s not due to technical restraints. Maybe the answer is to make the system available in more stores? Yesterday, an Apple executive announced that three more large chains will accept their payment system. All of the new places where iPhone users can wave their phones at cash registers are places to eat: Starbucks will start a pilot program at some point before the end of this year. Apple Pay was already part of the company’s iOS app: customers could use it to reload their stored-value accounts. Chili’s and KFC plan to start accepting Apple Pay sometime in 2016. Delta has added Apple Pay to its iOS app , allowing passengers booking tickets from their smartphones to pay using their Apple wallets as well. Restaurants and stores haven’t really been keen to adopt the payment method, though the lack of places to actually use mobile payments is part of the reason why consumers aren’t especially interested in using them, either. Starbucks Ditches Square, Will Cease Accepting Wallet Mobile Payments In Coming Months On the website it says to look for the icon for near-field payment, that sort of sideways wi-fi logo.  But lots of stores have pin-pads that would accept near-field payments, but aren’t on the list of stores that accept Apple Pay. Of the stores with the appropriate pin pads, some do accept Apple Pay, even if they’re not on the list.  Some stores don’t accept Apple Pay even if they are on the list.  They’ll have some excuse like the readers don’t work or aren’t hooked up or something.  Other stores did take Apple Pay at one point, but don’t anymore. If one of the main points of Apple Pay is that it’s easier than getting my card out, then having to guess whether or not it’ll work defeats that. You look like a dork waving your phone at the pin pad when everyone around you knows you’d have better luck waving a ham sandwich at it. Apple needs to put a foot down with the retailers and figure out a way to get some consistency going as to exactly where and with whom I can use Apple Pay, or else I fear that the technology will go the same way Google Wallet did.
