Microsoft Office Military Discount | The Military Wallet If you work in the military or any other large organization, you are probably familiar with Microsoft Office products. In fact, there is a good chance you use it in your daily work activities. The good news, is Microsoft and your organization both want you to be proficient with Microsoft Office so they have partnered together to give you access to Office at a discount through the Microsoft Home Use Program at a low price of $9.95 . The Microsoft Home Use Program is a benefit of Microsoft’s Volume Licensing programs. Organizations that participate in volume licensing programs have the option of offering extended licenses to their employees. If you are an active member of the US Military, then you can participate in this offer. How Microsoft Home Use Program Works Use your approved email address to claim your license for just $9.95 for either Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2013 for PC, or Office 2011 for MAC but not both. You can purchase the license now and use it in the future. Each license is valid for 2 installations. Download only: This offer only includes the downloaded software, it does not include the backup media. You can purchase the backup disks for $13.99. This is a personal decision, and not a requirement. If you are going to install the software right away, then you may not need the media. Just be sure to save the digital download and back up your saved version. Otherwise, an additional $13.99 isn’t a huge outlay for the physical copy of the software. Note: Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2013 is only compatible with Windows 7 and 8. It is not compatible with previous Windows versions.
