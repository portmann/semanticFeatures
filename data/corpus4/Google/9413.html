Microsoft: The $70 Lumia 430 Should Alarm Samsung And Google - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha In spite of the low market share of Windows phones, Nadella is still hell bent on competing with Samsung and other Android OEMs. The $70 Lumia 430 can steal customers away from $100 Android One and Samsung entry-level phones. Microsoft is now a freemium company that doesnâ€™t care about hardware profits. It wants to acquire the most amount of mobile users. I previously discussed Nadella's tactic to put custom Windows 10 ROMs inside Android phones. I was wrong to presume that Nadella will lessen Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) focus on Lumia hardware this year. The release of the $70 Lumia 430 says Microsoft still fancy itself as akin to a mini-Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) - with a mobile hardware/software ecosystem business model. I still believe that selling Lumia phones is not the best way for Microsoft to improve the 2.7% market share of Windows phones. However, I am now convinced that Microsoft makes so many billions of dollars from Android patent licensing that it can easily afford a price war with any Android handset maker. The IDC chart below reveals that there were only 34.9 million units of Windows phones that got shipped out last year, a meager 4.2% improvement over 2013's numbers. This weak performance is in spite of Microsoft taking control of Nokia's phone business last April 2014. In great contrast, there were more than a billion units of Android phones that got shipped out last year, a 32% year-over-year increase. Those 34.9 million units of Windows Phone sales/shipment were also 90% from Microsoft's own Lumia brands. Microsoft's phone hardware sales last year were around 31.41 million units. In my opinion, Nadella's willingness to come up with a $70 Windows 8.1 phone could help Microsoft catch up with No.5 global vendor, LG Electronics (NYSE: LG ), which shipped out 59.2 million smartphones last year. Price-sensitive buyers in Asia and other emerging markets will find a $70 Windows smartphone (that can run regular Windows-specific software and games) as a better buy than a $70 LG F6 Android phone. Samsung (OTC: SSNLF ) is still the no.1 in smartphone sales and if it wants to remain so, it might also join Microsoft in selling $70 Windows 10 phones. Perhaps Samsung could get a better revenue sharing deal from Microsoft than what it makes right now from its Android phones. Xiaomi, the Chinese startup who managed to dethrone in Samsung in China last year, has already cozied up to Microsoft. The reason why Google's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Android keeps getting bigger in terms of market share is that Android phone manufacturers are engaged in a race-to-the-bottom pricing strategy. There are now gazillions of sub-$100 Android phones from major brands and white-box manufacturers in China. However, a $70 Windows 8.1 phone is prima facie evidence that Microsoft is still desperate enough to join the race-to-the-bottom fight over smartphones. Sub-$80 Windows 10 and Windows 8.1 smartphones could help Microsoft double its Lumia sales to more than 60 million units this year. I repeat, Microsoft rakes in tons of no-cost money from licensing its patents to Android device makers like Samsung and LG Electronics. Microsoft can outplay any phone manufacturer in a price war. It will take some time but as long as Microsoft keeps coming up with super affordable smartphones, Windows 10 phones could eventually hit 100 million unit sales per year. The issue that OEMs might find it hard to support Windows 10 because Microsoft is still hell-bent on coming up with super cheap Lumia smartphones, has been addressed by Windows 10 custom ROMs. OEMs could still continue making Android phones and the buyers themselves will just decide if Windows 10 would offer them better privacy and services than what Google offers now. The razor-thin (or zero profit margin) on a $70 smartphone is a non-issue because Microsoft has already upgraded its mobile business to a freemium model . Increasing market share is not about hardware profits. It is all about getting the most eyeballs for mobile advertising and sales of apps/games. Selling phones at less than cost, giving away free Windows 10 ROMs to Android phone users, free games , free Office subscriptions, cloud storage, and Navigation systems are all just to hook more users in to the Windows 10 unified mobile/PC/Cloud ecosystem. Free software to entice users away from Android/iOS duopoly Super cheap hardware to win the next billion-plus smartphone users in emerging markets Data mine the users' browsing, shopping, mobile time spent Price-sensitive buyers in emerging markets will likely prefer a $70 Lumia 530 over a $100 Android One smartphone. Sub-$80 Windows 10 phones could help Microsoft gain entry to China's lucrative mobile advertising industry. Mobile advertising giants Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) and Google are still banned in China. Look at the chart below from Microsoft. Nadella needs a robust Windows 10 mobile environment like what Apple and Google enjoy right now. The mobile phone is central to the success of Microsoft's overall business plan. Free Windows 10 ROMs and cheap Lumias could help Microsoft penetrate the 520 million pair of advertising eyeballs in China. Research firm, eMarketer already estimates that China (excluding Hong Kong) will spend $12.14 in mobile advertising this year. Windows 10's coming this summer. The potential addressable market of Bing search advertising, Cortana, Skype, and other Microsoft cloud services now also includes hundreds of millions of people using pirated Windows software. It is easier to persuade people to click advertisements than force them to buy a Windows license. I strongly reiterate my Buy recommendation for MSFT. Nadella might just deliver the 2013 speculation that Microsoft could be the next Apple success story in mobile.
