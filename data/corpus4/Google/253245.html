Will Yahoo Finally Do The Right Thing? - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha Yahoo reached a deflection point that can turn the company around. Strangely, the company's core business burdens its valuation. The last few years have been a wild ride for Yahoo's (NASDAQ: YHOO ) shareholders - many times, it seemed like the stock was finally going to take off following an exciting announcement by Yahoo's management, but shares plunged a few weeks later. I think it is safe to say that the Yahoo we all knew (and some even loved) will no longer exist as an Internet company aspiring to challenge Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) or Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU ). A few years ago, Yahoo fell into some turbulence and could not find the right tools, people, and execution to turn it around. Investors started to react cynically to the company's attempts to revive its declining core business, whether by investing more in written content, launching YouTube-like activities, live-streaming an NFL match, or starting an independent video content channel. These are just a few examples of Yahoo's many ideas that may sound nice, but are actually incredibly naive. Instead of innovating and bringing new, fresh ideas to the market, Yahoo decided to reuse other companies' ideas - usually in a poorly-executed way that did not really challenge any internet giant. Cantor Fitzgerald's analyst Youssef Squali summarized it well: Overall, Yahoo remains challenged to keep up with growth in an industry that's innovating faster. We've seen progress in company culture, product improvement and user engagement over the last three years, but meaningful pick-up in monetization and revenue growth has been lacking. Investors' skepticism was fueled by disappointing financial results in recent years and an increasing dependence on the company's holdings in Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) and Yahoo Japan. Before the Alibaba IPO, Yahoo was traded as a proxy to the future Alibaba shares - now Yahoo's shares are traded based on a potential Alibaba stake spin-off and speculation on whether Yahoo Japan could replace Alibaba as the most important asset of Yahoo. All of these examples ignore one aspect of Yahoo that many investors seem to have forgotten about years ago - the company's core Internet business. The Wall Street Journal's report that Yahoo's board will consider selling the core business and discuss the next step in the Alibaba spin-off brought Yahoo's central business back to the main stage, but not in a good way. As I mentioned above, investors' skepticism was backed by YHOO's poor core business results, and the number of analysts' reports published recently have highlighted the burden that the company's core business has on its valuation. Objectively, this situation is absurd - a company's core business should not lower the value of its other businesses. This is a significant indicator that perhaps Yahoo is not in the right business. It would be insane to say that Coca-Cola's (NYSE: KO ) beverage business is useless to the company just as it would be ridiculous to say that Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) PC CPU business is useless to the chipmaker giant. The amazing thing is that in Yahoo's case, not only is that insanity happening, but also investors see it as the logical progression of the company. At this point, Yahoo needs to recalculate its plans and get rid of the burden. However, unloading its core business will transform Yahoo from a technology company focused on Internet services into a holding company looking for new, innovative initiatives. Long term, I would be very careful about determining any goals or targets when there is so much uncertainty around the company. However, in the short term, I believe that if the Yahoo board will approve selling the core business, it will prompt the stock's price appreciation regardless of the Alibaba spin-off, which also could serve as a catalyst once a tax-free process is officially approved. I'm bullish on Yahoo for the short term. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information. We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.
