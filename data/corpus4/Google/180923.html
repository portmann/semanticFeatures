Why Verizon's Go90 Will Likely Be A Flop - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha VZ executives are hyping the promise of its Go90 mobile service. There are a lot of core issues with Go90, such as monetization and high cost. Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ ) is really pumping the promise of its new "mobile-first" video service Go90. When Verizon's CEO Lowell McAdam was talking about a growth plateau in 2015 and 2016, he specifically noted Go90 in the conversation of what will drive "off to the races" growth in 2017 and beyond. Unfortunately, for McAdam, he's probably putting too many eggs in this one basket. First and foremost, the concept behind Go90 is that it will spark data consumption growth, and be a pioneer for pay-TV's move to mobile. Go90 will include ad-supported content with networks like ESPN, CBS (NYSE: CBS ) Sports, Discovery Channel, and TLC among others. Theoretically, an increase in data consumption means larger data packages, and more wireless revenue for Verizon. According to Cisco's VNI report , mobile video traffic will grow from 317.8 petabytes per month in 2014 to 2.7 exabytes per month in 2019, good for a compound annualized growth rate of more than 50%. Therefore, if Go90 is a success, then theoretically, it should lead to much higher revenue for Verizon, as larger data packages are required. The problem is whether or not Verizon is able to leave data plan prices intact long enough to capitalize on this increase in data consumption. LTE customers currently consume about 3.5 GB of data per month, and Macquarie expects that to exceed 6 GB per month by 2018. Despite Verizon making significant cuts to its wireless data plan prices over the last year, its prices still remain well above the likes of T-Mobile (NYSE: TMUS ) and Sprint (NYSE: S ). With T-Mobile and Sprint both aggressive with promotions, and showing no signs of slowing down, Verizon will surely have to once more lower data prices by 2018. The big question is by how much. As a result, the likely scenario of Verizon having to cut data prices to keep up with competitors limits the amount of revenue that Verizon can earn from Go90. Another potential problem for Verizon is the use of Wi-Fi, and the growing competition within mobile first video services. Currently, Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ), YouTube, and to a lesser degree DISH Network's (NASDAQ: DISH ) Sling TV are the top streaming services for mobile. And most consumers who use these services do so on Wi-Fi, not only because it is free but due to higher performance. While 4G LTE networks have made major strides in the right direction, no wireless network is a match for the more advanced broadband networks. Specifically, PC Mag found average download speeds of 19.1 Mbps on Verizon's 4G LTE network. That's fast, but large broadband service providers like AT&T (NYSE: T ), Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) (NASDAQ: CMCSK ), CenturyLink (NYSE: CTL ), and even Verizon have popular plans with twice that speed, and some of the more advanced networks like Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Fiber or AT&T GigaPower can offer speeds that are 50x greater. The bottom line is that when Wi-Fi is available, it is the superior option to LTE, and that's a problem that Verizon must deal with. As a result, the business model of Go90 seems flawed, but expensive for Verizon nonetheless. According to Macquarie, the additional capacity needed from Go90 could be a " back-breaker " for Verizon's network, thereby forcing the company to increase capital expenditures and spectrum investments to handle the increased strain on its network. Recently, I wrote an article explaining why Verizon's growth initiatives will fall flat due to its lack of financing options and its need to divest essential assets to fund necessary investments. With over $110 billion in debt, capital expenditures of more than $26 billion during the last four quarters, and Verizon's 12-month free cash flow essentially wiped out with dividend payments, Go90 could present a big risk for the company. The reason is because Verizon has adopted an "all-in" approach to Go90 with McAdam expecting to report the service's " wild success " by this time next year. However, the structure of Go90 combined with the growing competitive landscape for similar services suggests it won't be a monetary success for Verizon, but rather a monetary drain as company executives soak more and more money into the service to compensate the drain it will cause on the wireless network. That's why overall, Go90 is likely bad news for Verizon, and yet one more reason to stay away from the stock.
