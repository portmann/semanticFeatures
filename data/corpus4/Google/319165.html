Check your browser settings or contact your network administrator. Having trouble charging your MacBook? You may have one of a “limited number” of charge cables that contain a flaw that can prevent charging now being recalled by Apple.Â  The tech company announced over the weekend that it would recall an unspecified number of USB-C charge cables for MacBooks worldwide. The cables, which were sold with new MacBooks through June 2015 or as standalone accessories, may fail “due to a design issue,” Apple said, noting that devices using the affected cables may not charge or may only charge intermittently. The cables can be identified by the stamp “Designed by Apple in California. Assembled in China.” Apple will replace the affected cords free of charge, with new, redesigned versions. Customers who registered their MacBooks will automatically be sent a new cable to the address they used by the end of the month.
