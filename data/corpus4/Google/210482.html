Google Intensifies Campaign Against Microsoft, Offers Free Premium Apps To Office 365 Subscribers - Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) | Seeking Alpha Enterprise subscribers of Office 365 can now get free premium Google Apps for Work subscriptions. Google wants to increase the market share of its premium cloud-based productivity apps because Office 365 is increasingly getting more popular. Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) or should I say Alphabet, is notching up its campaign against the very popular Office 365 cloud-based productivity suite of Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ). In a blog post two days ago, Rich Rao (Google Apps For Work Global Sales chief) wants companies with existing Enterprise Agreement (EA) with another software provider to sign-up and use the enterprise/premium version of Google Apps until their EAs expire. While Rao did not mention it, this is a direct campaign against the corporate-centric Office 365 business of Microsoft . Google is specifically trying to compel existing companies with Office 365 subscriptions to switch for free to Google Apps for Work. The free to use offer for Google Apps is only available for corporate clients that are currently paying for Office 365 subscriptions in North America but I expect this to be expanded to other markets too. Google will only charge these companies once their current EAs with Microsoft or other firms expires. Google further sweetened this sweetheart deal by also offering to help pay for part of the deployment costs of switching to Google Apps from Office 365. The Google Apps for Work is already available for dirt-cheap subscription fees. It won't really be a detrimental contra revenue tactic for Google to offer them for free now to corporate users attached to Office 365. From the usual basic $5 per user monthly fee for Google Apps for Work, Alphabet recently reduced it to just $3 per user. If we compare Google's two offers to the Business plans of Office 365, the $3 per user/month Google Apps clearly offers more features than the $5 per user/month package from Microsoft. The cheapest Office 365 plan from Microsoft doesn't offer free 24/7 phone/email tech support or custom business email address. In spite of the cheaper costs of subscribing to Google Apps for Work, more companies are still favoring Office 365. As per the August 2015 report of Bitglass, Microsoft's Office 365 usage surged 300%, from 7.7 market share in 2014 to 25.2% this year. Google Apps only increased its share from 16.3% to 22.8% in enterprise cloud-based email and productivity software. Please study the chart below from BitGlass' Cloud Adoption Report 2015 edition. In less than a year, Microsoft's Office 365 outgrew former cloud productivity leader Google Apps for Work in the all-important enterprise market. Bitglass' report made it very clear that Microsoft is beating Google when it comes to enterprise-centric cloud applications. It is therefore not a surprise that Alphabet is now more aggressive by directly targeting existing subscribers of Office 365. Bitglass found out that 60% of corporations with 1,000 or more employees already use cloud software suite. It is also important to take into account that 44.2% companies with less than 500 employees are also embracing cloud-based subscription-only software for their daily needs. The future of office productivity is clearly trending toward the cloud. Google's cloud-based software are not as comprehensive or deeply-embedded as Microsoft Office. By giving free-to-use- until-you-unsubscribe-from-Office 365 privileges, Google is giving companies the chance to try and be proficient in Google Apps so their workers will find easy to migrate from Office 365. I am long MSFT and GOOG. I am endorsing a Buy for these two competing software-as-a-service rivals. The cloud-centric approach of providing software and collaborative tools is a growth industry with few players involved. Google's aggressive move to try and poach more Office 365 subscribers is therefore decisive. A contra revenue approach is justified because Google's cloud apps are not getting adopted as fast as Office 365 is getting welcomed by corporations. Please study the chart below, out of 6,000 companies surveyed by Bitglass, Microsoft's cloud software/service package is clearly getting more subscribers. In the EMEA regions, Microsoft's Office 365 has a far higher adoption rate than Google, 42% vs. 17%. In the APAC region, Google also trails Microsoft's cloud software in terms of corporate adoptions, 25% vs. 36%. The decades-old dependence of many companies on Microsoft Office gives Office 365 a huge advantage. Alphabet therefore has no choice but to do a contra revenue tactic to try and attract more paying customers. Google also needs a more robust revenue stream from its cloud apps. This extra money could it offset any reduction in advertising revenue arising from the growing use of ad-blocking software on desktop PCs and mobile devices. Long-term enterprise subscriptions for Google Apps for Work is one avenue where Alphabet can make decent recurring revenue outside of its core advertising business.
