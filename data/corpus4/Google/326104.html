In an effort to lure tech-focused fans, the Phoenix Suns have partnered with Verizon Wireless to offer free mobile data with every game ticket purchase. Fans can earn up to 11 GB of data during the current season, Verizon says , with the data going toward the front of the customerâ€™s phone plan for that month. Any leftover data is rolled over. A ticket in the lower bowl of Talking Stick Resort Arena will give fans one gigabyte of data with their ticket purchase, while two games will rack in three GB and three games are worth six GB. Seats in the upper bowl earn 0.5 GB per ticket for one game, 1.5 GB for two, and three GB for three games. â€œData drives a lot of behavior these days,â€? Jason Rowley, president of the Suns, told MarketWatch . â€œSports fans watching the game in the arena or at home are also utilizing their mobile device to download stats and stream playbacks.â€? The program is a trial from Verizon, as part of its â€œFreeBee Perkâ€? program. The company says it’s looking at similar promotions for companies across other industries, though it didnâ€™t give specifics.
