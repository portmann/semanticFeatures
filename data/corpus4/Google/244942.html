Amazon May Be Topping Out - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Amazon only meeting past expectations yet stock has doubled. Stronger dollar will further impact international business. One of the best performing sectors this year has been technology and online retail giant Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), which has seen its shares more than double. On Monday, shares hit another new high, mainly due to growing enthusiasm around AWS. However, shares seem like they are peaking in the near term, and this year's gains are not going to be repeated in 2016. The latest leg up came after a strong Q3 report , highlighted by the tremendous growth in Amazon Web Services. Investors cheered the segment's 78% year-over-year revenue growth, along with its operating margin that nearly tripled the year ago period's value. The Q3 beat and decent guidance has analyst estimates on the rise. However, investors should realize that revenue and EPS estimates for 2015 are actually below where they were going into the Q3 2014 report, while shares have more than doubled since then. I'm a little concerned that the stock's rally has gotten ahead of itself, as I don't know if AWS will be able to meet fast rising expectations in 2016. Last week, Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) made a key cloud hire , adding former VMWare (NYSE: VMW ) CEO Diane Greene to lead the firm's cloud operations. Google also is acquiring another firm that Greene founded, Bebop, a developer platform for enterprise software. My concern is that investors will lose interest in AWS when growth rates in 2016 start to slow and profitability gains come to a crawl. The last two quarters have seen year-over-year revenue growth of 81% and 78%, respectively, numbers that will be hard to match next year as prior period values start to rise significantly. Over the past year, AWS' operating margin went from 8.4% to 25.0%, and gains of that size will be hard to replicate. If Google turns out to be a large competitor in this fast-growing space, Amazon might even see margins contract as it is forced to cut prices to remain competitive. Another item that worries me, and this is not Amazon specific, is the continued rise in the US Dollar as many are anticipating a rate hike from the Federal Reserve in December. Since the Q3 report, as seen in the chart below, the Dollar Currency Index has risen by more than three percent. This worries me because the international business represented one-third of Amazon's Q3 sales. Analysts are currently about $900 million above the midpoint of company Q4 revenue guidance, which worries me given the dollar's strength. On a related note, investors have started to send interest rates higher and they could go up even more if we get that hike from the Fed. While Amazon's sales were up 23% in Q3 over the prior year period, interest expenses soared from $49 million to $116 million. This worries me because Amazon's trailing 12 month debt (liabilities to assets) ratio continues to rise, seen below. If the balance sheet worsens, Amazon will need to take on more debt or potentially raise equity. Either situation is bad because interest costs will reduce net income, or dilution will hurt EPS, making it hard to Amazon to triple EPS in 2016 as analysts are expecting. The final thing that worries me is that the stock itself has become a bit overextended. As seen in the chart below, Amazon shares are nearly $100 above their 50-day moving average. I added arrows to show what happens when the stock gets too far above this key technical level, and the past three times it has meant a flat stock for months. There is a potential short opportunity here for investors who believe the stock has peaked, because a pullback to the rising 50-day isn't out of the question. Amazon shares hit a new high on Monday, but I'm worried that the stock has peaked in the short term. AWS enthusiasm seems to be spreading like wildfire, but what happens when growth rates naturally slow and competitors like Google start to strengthen? Analyst estimates are actually below where they were going into the Q3 2014 report, and the stock still trades for 120 times expected next year's earnings (which assumes they triple). On the technical front, the stock is way ahead of its 50-day moving average, which has led to months of stagnation in the past. I believe investors have an opportunity here to fade the rally, with a short opportunity existing until the stock trades down to that key technical level.
