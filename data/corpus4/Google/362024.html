Google ( GOOG / GOOGL ) is going after Intel . They are working with IBM (NYSE: IBM ), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ), and Rackspace (NYSE: RAX ) to attack the dominant player in server chips. Google is developing a data center server chip. They will give away the final design through Facebook's (NASDAQ: FB ) Open Compute Project. As Intel currently has almost a 100% market share in date center server processors, Google is effectively trying to defeat a monopoly. Three years ago, the OpenPower Foundation was started by Google, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ), and Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) to develop competition against Intel; today that effort appeared to be moving forward. This collaboration could increase Rackspace's value to potential suitors including HP (NYSE: HPQ ), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), or especially IBM. The potential target has spoken with advisors at Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ) about such a deal. SL (NYSEMKT: SLI ) is getting acquired by Handy & Harman (NASDAQ: HNH ) for $40 per share.

Rite Aid (NYSE: RAD ) management continues to expect its acquisition by Walgreens (NASDAQ: WBA ) to close in the second-half of 2016.
