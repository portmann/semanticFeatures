Microsoft: Buy Opportunities Coming Your Way - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft's new vision is a major shift in the way the company sees its future. With Nadella at the helm, Microsoft is already seeing the gains of that shift. Before Satya Nadella took the top job, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) was a devices and services company under the reign of Steve Ballmer. At the time, it seemed like a good move because desktop users were on the decline and everything was moving into mobile. Unfortunately, Microsoft's Windows Phone never took off the way they'd hoped because Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iOS and Google's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Android pretty much took control over mobile operating systems, leaving Microsoft looking like a wannabe in that space. To break free from the shackles of that perception, the company tried to transform itself into a hardware and software company, much like what Apple is. But unfortunately, that's a marriage not every company can succeed at. Microsoft took over Nokia (NYSE: NOK ) while Google took over Motorola - each in an attempt to outdo Apple. That strategy never worked as both these companies' DNA is software, software and software, and we all know how that turned out. After the Nokia fiasco, Microsoft learned its lesson, took it on the chin and pushed Satya Nadella - who was, prior to his promotion to the top job, responsible for Microsoft's Cloud and Enterprise group - to spearhead the company. Microsoft's Vision changed after Satya Nadella took over and it now looks like this: Microsoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. Our strategy is to build best-in-class platforms and productivity services for a mobile-first, cloud-first world. Simple and to the point. Nothing to confuse users or stakeholders. Notice one more thing - there is no mention of hardware or devices in their vision. It's just Mobile and Cloud. Simple, yet very effective. There is no confusion about where Microsoft wants to get in the next decade. Microsoft will be a technology company, a pure-breed one at that - and everything else that they do will be to direct their customers to these two offerings. Microsoft has identified three verticals for its future - Windows, Office and Azure. Everything else they do will only be the hooks that drive the growth of these three verticals. Their strategy seems to be simple: Get as many businesses and enterprises on the Azure platform, let them use Microsoft to handle their IT infrastructure needs and make it as easy as possible for them to use the Office suite, whose strength was always businesses, and in the process, keep Windows OS ticking along. This, in itself, is a huge shift for Microsoft because the company has always focused on end users like us. From being known as a company that built operating systems that powered every home desktop around the world, the company is moving in a big way towards building an ecosystem for businesses. There is a gap in this segment left by Apple and Google, who have been concentrating on the individual end user through their devices and operating systems. Microsoft is now trying to capitalize on that gap, and from the looks of it, they have already had a taste of success. Businesses everywhere are using the Microsoft Cloud as their digital platform to drive their ambitious transformation agendas," said Satya Nadella, chief executive officer at Microsoft. "Businesses are also piloting Windows 10, which will drive deployments beyond 200 million active devices. - Techcrunch Do you know why Windows Phone died on the vine ? Because Microsoft tried to be in control of everything and never took the effort to build a thriving third party developer community. No developers equals no apps, and no apps equals no end users. Just look at the way Apple and Google have built thriving communities of developers, that's the reason why they succeeded. The strength of an OS is initially inherent, but as time goes by, it's the utility and appeal of the apps that pushes it forward. When the first iPhone came out, it had to have native apps that would fill that gap. With the popularity of that first iPhone came a large user base, which, in turn, attracted developers and software companies. Those developers, in their turn, gave further appeal to the OS through the variety of apps they developed. The entire process had the cadence of a well-composed opera - and that's the reason why iOS is where it is today. Source: 9to5Mac as reported on Jan 26, 2016 Microsoft isn't going to be making that mistake again, so instead of building an app developer community from scratch - something they may well fail at - Nadella is using Xamarin as a ready-to-use solution to solve that problem. Brilliant move - and that's the first major shift in Microsoft's focus. When Microsoft Azure came into existence, I was so sure that the company would force everybody to use Windows servers and thereby let linux users go to their competitors; essentially, everyone thought they'd be shooting themselves in the foot once again. When Microsoft offered Azure on Linux, it was the first major step for the company to embrace open source platforms. Without Linux, Microsoft would have lost the huge open source community to its rivals, thereby limiting their own growth for the sake of Windows adoption. This is exactly what the "Old" Microsoft would have done. But not anymore. Investor-speak: Microsoft Now Walking the Walk Giving the company a new direction wasn't just a media ploy or a stakeholder eyewash. Microsoft is fully committed to their new direction, which is clearly underlined by the way they've changed how they report their income. As you can see from the tables below, Microsoft's segmentation moved from 10 line items in 2014 to four line items in 2015. Looking at the change, it makes a lot of sense to do that. Not only will it align senior management and their divisions to the company's new goals, but it will also give stakeholders and the media a tremendous amount of visibility into the success of those goals. I believe that's a gutsy move because such transparency at this scale is a rare commodity. Revenue declined in the personal computing and productivity and business processes segment, while increasing in the Intelligent Cloud segment. I fear that this trend is possibly going to continue into the future - especially for the personal computing segment, which houses the windows 10 licensing revenues. Intelligent cloud will keep posting growth, as that market outlook is 19.62% growth over the next few years. As the cloud infra-division scales up, it will, in turn, help Office products get better sales traction. Windows will probably benefit from scale at some point as well. So if Microsoft keeps moving its cloud unit at 20% growth rate for the next four years, then the company will have doubled its current earnings for the division. What I love about Microsoft now is the clarity in their vision and their willingness to stick their necks out and tell investors: "Hey, we tried and took it on the chin, but we're going to do something about it - and here's our map to get there." And they've already started showing that their new model works. The entire transition itself might easily take two to three years, and in that time, the cloud computing division should match or even possibly beat their Windows division's sales numbers. And that's exactly what their CEO wants - strong alternate growth engines that can offset their reliance on a single vertical. From an investor perspective, while the company is transitioning from its devices and services to the mobile-first cloud-first model, I see several buy opportunities coming my way.
