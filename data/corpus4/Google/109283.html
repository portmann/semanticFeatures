Amazon: Racing To Zero Or Racing To The Top? - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Amazon has debuted dedicated mobile apps for its Cloud Drive. This is a big deal, and I think it can be a very big deal because of who and what we’re talking about. Amazon, at least I believe, isn’t getting into the cloud storage business to offer cloud storage; cloud storage is simply a user acquisition strategy. That said, where I really think Amazon is going with this is into app aggregation. I think the first one of the mega-tech companies or even the first cloud storage company to accomplish this moves ahead of the pack in a big, big way. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) had debuted dedicated mobile apps for its Cloud Drive as first reported by TechCrunch . This is a big deal, and I think it can be a very big deal because of who and what we're talking about. I'll explain. I believe the Cloud Storage niche is a complete commodity. Box (NYSE: BOX ) is working hard to change its positioning under this storm cloud assumption with recent integrations, most notably with IBM (NYSE: IBM ), but overall I view the niche as a commodity. I believe with the niche being a commodity that it is actively and will continue to be in a race to zero. Amazon has actually greatly furthered that race to zero with its superbly low pricing of its skeletal service offering. Amazon currently prices Cloud Drive at $60/year under its Unlimited Everything plan. Amazon's Unlimited Photos plan prices even lower at a shockingly low $11.99/year. For this particular service, Amazon has no storage limit and now has a dedicated mobile app - Cloud Drive Photos. Outside of borderline negligible security offerings, integrations (although I'm reserving judgment of Box's integration with IBM as noted above), and price, these cloud offerings have zero differentiation. The only way to aggregate users is to tether the storage to a broader platform, outspend from an S&M standpoint, or offer cheaper services. Differentiation is an issue in this niche and perpetuates the commoditization. With that out of the way, let's talk about what I think Amazon is doing here in the early going. I should start by saying what a throwback Amazon's mobile apps are. The below images have been provided courtesy of TechCrunch: But Amazon, like Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), has this brilliant way of testing before doing - which seems like an obvious thing to do in tech, but still doesn't get done all that often. Amazon, at least I believe, isn't getting into the cloud storage business to offer cloud storage. It's getting into the business as an ancillary for its other, more monetizable, longer-term viability driving services. Cloud storage is simply a user acquisition strategy; a "try me" sign that isn't threatening and offers an existing familiarity. I think what Amazon is doing is rolling out its dedicated apps in the way it is, skeletal and minimalist, to not be overwhelming. If you've ever used Amazon's music services, you know how things can get overwhelming in a hurry, especially, if you're coming from an alternative ecosystem. Amazon wanted to present a very basic, very easy to attach to interface that's open about its limited use cases. For instance, you can't edit documents, upload from mobile, auto sync, etc. I think this is a low-risk, high-reward traction and usage test that if it proves out will show Amazon expanding on the current app capacity and capability. The apps just don't make sense longer term as-is. That said, where I really think Amazon is going with this is into app aggregation. I mean, think about it. Amazon's platform has been growing ever more all-inclusive - allowing a user to become fully immersed in the ecosystem. You can do everything from under the Amazon umbrella and within the Amazon bubble, including "real world"/non-digital actions. You can grocery shop, take delivery, listen to music, watch movies, and store digital content. Just about "the works," which is again why the apps don't make sense as-is and why I believe Amazon app aggregates as its way to differentiate. I wrote an article a while back about app aggregation, which I believe is the next big thing in tech and which I believe is the next big expectation from user bases. Why should I have to have ten passwords if I'm using a cloud storage platform? Shouldn't I be able to access all of my storage "units" from one singular platform? Doesn't this make more sense for the storage provider? Also, why can't my other apps like Evernote be accessible from this one command center? I think the first one of the mega-tech companies - Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Facebook, Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), Amazon, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) - or even the first Cloud Storage company to accomplish this moves ahead of the pack in a big, big way. It just makes more sense to lock a user in and not ask them to leave the room and come back. I believe Amazon has moved into the Cloud Storage arena to try to do just that - app aggregate. It already has the overlay platform/umbrella of services to have this make sense, it has the finances, the size, the integration expertise, and the market sway to make this a "new normal." Amazon wants to and should definitely pursue being the Bossa Nova in tech/Cloud Storage/user convenience. At least, if you're asking me, this is what Amazon wants to do. I just have a hard time believing this bare bones app launch is the final product. I think if Amazon does intend to unify the apps under its Cloud Drive, it would do well to look into replicating or simply outright buying SMB/enterprise solution startups ClipCard and Jumptuit . ClipCard and Jumptuit are both app aggregators and two of the finest I've seen in the private space. ClipCard has a unique Slack integration that's hugely useful to a massive user base that Amazon should want to attract. Jumptuit allows for file and content migration between services. I don't think I need to explain why that's beneficial and again hugely important. I recently had a chat with ClipCard management after openly calling the company a commodity and making claims that it has no hope for monetization. After a sit-down in which management opened up about the platform and walked me through some of the unique capabilities, I'm now convinced that the platform could stand alone. And not just stand alone, do well for itself in time. I think if Amazon wants to start somewhere, ClipCard is a great place to start. Jumptuit has its benefits as well, although without a deep under the hood look at the tech, I can't say with certainty that Amazon would be buying anything defensible from the company. Still, a Jumptuit overlay on the Amazon ecosystem would be powerful and the sum of all parts outcome might be defensive enough to justify the purchase. Valuations are unknown for both companies, but I can't imagine either is egregious this early into their development. Amazon is in a position in which it shouldn't waste time developing tech - it should instead opt to buy; pull forward growth, pull forward development, and pull in users to the ecosystem. If the tech space has shown us anything of consistency, it's that once a user is in an ecosystem, it's really, really hard to pull that user out. Amazon could offer a unique, value-added service (even for free for a while if it should) to draw users from other easier to use or more familiar ecosystems. Amazon has some great conveniences it offers via its ecosystem and an app aggregation service (tethered and based from a cloud storage obviously) would definitely draw the eye of the demographic it wants. Heck, it would draw the eye of a lot of folks. I think this is where Amazon is going with its Cloud Drive and now dedicated mobile apps. I'll be closely watching any further developments and update readers as they come along. Source: Amazon: Racing To Zero Or Racing To The Top? Disclosure: I am/we are long FB, AAPL.
