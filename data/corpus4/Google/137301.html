Nadella: "We will have developer versions of it first, and then it'll be more commercial uses cases, and it'll evolve ... This is a five-year journey, but we're looking forward to getting a v1 out, which is more around developers and enterprises. It's in the Windows 10 timeframe, which means that it is within the next year." ( video ) Nonetheless, he reiterates HoloLens will ultimately target both consumers and businesses. "In general Microsoft's approach will be always this dual-use focus, or this multi-focus. What we can uniquely do is bridge consumer to enterprise ... In the HoloLens case, when I look at the interest, it's amazing how many are in hospitals, healthcare, retail. That's where I'm seeing the interest and we'll definitely go after it." Still no word on pricing. Nadella previously stated Microsoft plans to let 3rd-party OEMs create headsets based on HoloLens' underlying Windows Holographic platform.
