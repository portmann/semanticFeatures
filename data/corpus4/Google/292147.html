Apple shutting down iAd App Network - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Jan 15 2016, 19:17 ET | About: Apple Inc. (AAPL) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor "The iAd App Network will be discontinued as of June 30, 2016," Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) states on its developer site. "Although we are no longer accepting new apps into the network, advertising campaigns may continue to run and you can still earn advertising revenue until June 30." The App Network, one part of the iAd platform, allows developers to promote their App Store apps across iAd's publisher network The news follows a BuzzFeed report stating Apple plans to phase out iAd's sales force, while allowing publishers to directly sell ads through a programmatic (automated) ad-buying platform and keep 100% of generated revenue. BuzzFeed suggested the move could be a negative for The Rubicon Project (NYSE: RUBI ) and other ad tech firms Apple has partnered with to enable programmatic iAd buys. iAd, launched in 2010, has served ads on iOS devices, Macs, and PCs. Tim Cook has suggested Apple's main goal with the platform is to help developers make money, rather than create a major new revenue source. The business has faced stiff competition from rivals such as Google's AdMob unit and Facebook's Audience Network. Great is all I can say. More users can TRUST Apple. The insidious use of profiling which Google, Facebook and other use to feed targeted ads is one of the most offensive parts of the internet.  I'm pleased Apple is differentiating itself and not proceeding to compete by developing and using iAd. That's a good point.  I've actually tried some searches with Bing lately because there are so many sales sites getting returned on Google searches.  You have to scroll down and down to get to something along the line of what you're looking for.  It sure didn't used to be that way.  In the end, I think it would have hurt Apple more than they would have gained in revenue. what sales ads are you even talking about? i havent seen that many if at all. bing search? hahahaha good one. i left apple because of their nazi level control of the OS. cant choose default apps like the browser. cant change default search. looks like google just laid the smackdown on apples candy arse. even more bad news for the marketing company we call apple. google is just killing it in android.
