Microsoft: Windows 10 And Edge Browser Are Very Advertiser-Friendly - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Default privacy settings of Windows 10 allow more in-depth data gathering. Windows 10 is now being used on more than 75 million computers. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) has implemented a more aggressive personal data gathering strategy in Windows 10. This might boost the company's online advertising unit. There are now more than 75 million people using Windows 10, one month after it was released. The freemium tactic of giving away free Windows 10 OS updates is now addressed by Microsoft's heightened appetite for user data gathering. After installation, the default privacy settings of Windows 10 allow Microsoft access to a generous amount of personal data of users. Millions of ordinary PC users are unlikely to tinker with the default choices on the 13 different pages of privacy settings in Windows 10. I opine that Microsoft's personalized ads business could soon match the sophistication of Google's (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) data mining and ad targeting capabilities. Google's often intrusive personal data scrapping made it very successful in delivering highly-personalized ads. With Windows 10's more open personal information sharing features, Microsoft's targeted ads products might become more palatable to digital advertisers. Microsoft's hyper-localized ads offering is now more powerful because the Location option on privacy settings of Windows 10 is turned on by default. Unless a person takes the time to probe into the different privacy settings options of Windows 10, Microsoft could mine information out of him in more than a dozen ways. The many avenues that Windows 10 can funnel user information through to Microsoft has even prompted enterprising people to sell software that allegedly will disable Microsoft's data gathering tools. Imitating the aggressive approach of Google toward user data gathering is a necessary evil that Microsoft must do. The freemium approach of giving away free software and services goes hand-in-hand with advertising. Consequently, Advertisers prefer providers who can give them the most extensive set of personal information. The more people who install Windows 10 and not disable the data tracking tools, the better chance there is that Microsoft would steal advertising clients away from Google. As of now, Google, thanks to its omnipresent search engine, dominates the online advertising business. The worldwide estimate for digital ad spending this year will reach $170.85 billion. Search ads will account for $81.59 billion. Search advertising will even grow into a $130.58 billion industry by 2019. Unfortunately, Microsoft's Bing search engine's global market share is less than 10.5%, while Google has more than 70%. Advertisers covet Google's AdWords advertising platform because of its all-inclusive data mining advantage. The more aggressive default privacy settings implemented in Windows 10 is likely intentional. It helps Microsoft improve Bing's databank on people and their habits. The deeper Bing can delve into (and record) people's browsing/shopping/computing habits, the more chance there is that advertisers will consider Bing Ads over Google's AdWords. Microsoft also does not own a successful social networking site. It is even overshadowed by Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) and Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) when it comes to digital advertising. Hopefully, the generous default personal information sharing feature helps Microsoft create a mini-social network out of the 75 million people that now use Windows 10. Like how Facebook gather personal data on its site, the Windows system apps' default access to messaging/SMS/camera/microphone/contacts/calendar/photos/music on Windows 10 computers is clearly to help Microsoft gather more information on people. Microsoft's decision to not support third-party browser extensions in the new Edge browser is also favorable to digital advertisers. Edge is the default browser in Windows 10 and its lack of support for third-party extensions makes it immune to the threat of uBlock/AdBlock Plus. Savvy advertisers who are not happy with Google's approval of AdBlock Plus & uBlock on the official Chrome Web Store, might find Microsoft Edge the better choice for browser-specific /browsing history-dependent advertising. Digital advertising is not very efficient when browsers like Chrome allow people to install/use ad-blocking extensions. Edge is the successor of Internet Explorer. Different versions of Internet Explorer still support ad-blocking browser extensions. I hope Microsoft keeps ad-blocking browser extensions away from Edge. If Edge achieves the same level of mainstream usage that Internet Explorer (54% global share) now enjoys, Microsoft can offer advertisers a haven that is free from ad-blocking software. I approve of the shift toward ad-supported freemium business model. Advertising, unlike selling commercial software, is not vulnerable to piracy . I like the default openness of personal information sharing on Windows 10. Exhaustive data mining is just part and parcel of Microsoft's shift toward freemium. People who use free software/online services still pay for them by sharing their personal information. Microsoft's non-support for third-party extensions on the new Edge internet browser is also a big step toward attracting more advertising clients. A healthy growth in annual advertising bookings is highly desirable. Aside from the fact that software is prone to piracy, the rise of competent free alternative operating systems and productivity programs endangers commercial software sales. Google enjoys a bigger market cap than Microsoft. This is in spite Google relying on advertising, not on sales of software or hardware. Ad-supported freemium strategy might therefore also help Microsoft win the approval of investors who now value Google at 30x or higher P/E. Disclosure: I am/we are long MSFT.
