Netflix: The Real House Of Cards - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Trading at an outrageous 112 P/E ratio. Streaming content obligations of $9.5B versus $16.5M of cash flow from operations in 2014. Increasing competition potentially leading to declining revenue growth. Nearing potential market saturation in the US. At the end of the 2014, Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) had 54.5 million subscribers, including 37.7 million subscribers in the US. By comparison, Time Warner's (NYSE: TWX ) HBO had 127 million subscribers globally at the end of 2013, including 43 million in the US. Netflix grew paid subscribers by 31% versus the previous year, including 19% paid subscriber growth in the US. Over the past year, revenue increased by 26%. Over the past six years, earnings per share have grown at a compounding 18.6% annual rate. Unfortunately, the stock is trading at an outrageously high 112 P/E. I believe that increased competition and market saturation are going to lead to slowing revenue growth and eventually a falling stock price. I plan on avoiding this speculative stock in my portfolio . In the chart below, Netflix's stock price has run into price resistance at $480 per share and formed a double top. Since then, the stock price has pulled back 13%. There is price support near $320 per share, 24% lower than current levels. If the stock price breaks below $320, watch out below, as investor rush for the exits. If it trades back to a more reasonable 25 times 2014 earnings, the stock could fall below $100 per share (75% lower than the current stock price). During 2014, Netflix had net income of $266.8M versus the current market cap of $25B. If you factor out a $39M one-time tax accrual resolution, Netflix trades at an outrageously expensive 112 P/E. Despite growing earnings per share at a compounding rate of 18.9% per year over the past six years, you wouldn't know it by looking at the balance sheet. Debt and streaming content obligations are growing at an alarming rate, and cash flow from operations is almost non-existent. For a company that had total net income of $396M over the past three years, debt is being added at an alarming rate. To this point, the additional debt has been used to fund the purchase of additional content. At the end of 2012, there was $200M of long-term debt. Two years later, the long-term debt increased to $900M. On 2/2/15, the company announced the pricing of an additional $1.5B of debt. Why is debt building at an alarming rate? And where is the positive cash flow from operations? Last year, cash flow from operations totaled $16.5M versus a market cap of $25B. This equate to a market cap that is 1,500 times last year's cash flow. If you use a three-year average of cash flow from operations, the market cap to cash flow ratio improves to a still lofty 550 times. It appears that net income is a function of content valuation and amortization versus actual cash being generated by the company. At the end of 2014, Netflix had future content commitments of $9.5B versus $7.3B at the end of 2013, for an increase of 30%. Without significant cash flows from operators, how is Netflix going to pay for these content obligations? Is Netflix building its own house of cards, borrowing money to buy content? When subscriber growth slows, this all falls apart. There are currently 123.2 million households in the US. 78.1% have high speed internet service. Given 37.7 million subscribers in the US, Netflix already has captured 41% of potential US customers in the US. 100% is not possible considering some households won't subscribe and some will share their login information with other households. I think that Netflix's potential is limited to a similar level as HBO's current 43 million US subscriber base, about 14% higher than their current level. In 2014, Netflix's US subscriber growth slowed to 18.9% versus 24.5% in 2013. There still appears to be room to grow in International markets. When investors witness slowing subscriber growth, look for Netflix's stock price to plummet back to a more reasonable valuation. 7.6 million U.S. households have exited pay television. Many have chosen Netflix as a low cost alternative for TV and movie content. Last year, Netflix's revenue grew at a rate of 25.8% versus the previous year. Growth seemed unaffected by competition from the likes of Google's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) YouTube, Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Prime Instant Video streaming service, or Hulu Plus's $7.99 per month subscription service. Hulu Plus is jointly owned by Twenty-First Century Fox (NASDAQ: FOX ) (NASDAQ: FOXA ), Disney (NYSE: DIS ) and Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) (NASDAQ: CMCSK ). But is future growth going to be affected by the continued onslaught of new competition? HBO: Staring this month, just in time for season 5 of Game of Thrones, HBO Now will be available for $14.99 a month on Apple TV, as an exclusive launch partner for HBO. Up to this point, HBO was only available to those with a pay TV subscription. Now, it is going to be available as a standalone subscription-based streaming service. This will go head to head with Netflix with better movies and better original content. While the price is higher, look for the higher quality content to steal away Netflix customers, especially when HBO Now is expanded to companies like Roku, Google, and Amazon. Walmart's (NYSE: WMT ) Vudu: The streaming services allows you to rent movies for about $5 each and purchase for about $20 each, depending on the movie. The exciting part of Vudu is the availability to stream UltraViolet movies . Different websites and communities are selling digital UV movie codes for about $1-5 each, allowing you permanent streaming rights. Individuals are able to buy most new releases for less than the price of renting a movie. The best place to buy UV codes is the UV Google Plus community. Steaming TV Services: Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is expected to add a cable streaming package to Apple TV. Sling TV already offers this type of package. For $20 per month, Sling is offering 21 cable channels including ESPN, AMC, TBS, CNN, History, Disney, Cartoon Network, and TNT. You can test it out for free for 7-days. It is a nice alternative to a $100 cable bill. Free Web-streaming Apps: The list of available free apps for streaming video content is seemingly endless and growing. Check out Roku 's apps with free TV and movie content including Bloomberg TV, PBS, PBS kids, and Crackle. When investing in stocks, my most important metrics are earnings and cash flows relative to the stock price, factoring in the expected rate of future earnings growth. There are a number of investors or speculators that are willing to completely ignore these metrics and focus only on revenue growth and stock price momentum. In the late 1990s, we saw this same story. When growth begins to slow and the momentum stock breaks technical resistance levels, these overpriced stocks fell fast. While it is possible that some of these companies grow into these valuations over time, it also rather unlikely. Netflix has a great product and offers value for the customer, but the earnings and cash flow don't justify the stock price. In 2014, NFLX earned $3.69 per share for trailing 112 P/E ratio. For every $100 invested, your share of earnings was $0.89, for a 0.89% earnings yield. Don't be long this stock when this house of cards falls down.
