Apple -2.4% to new 52-week low amid Nikkei chip report aftermath - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha May 12 2016, 10:53 ET | About: Apple Inc. (AAPL) | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor A 2.4% decline in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) -- making a fresh 52-week low today -- is being tied to the Nikkei report pointing to a rough year for iPhone suppliers.
