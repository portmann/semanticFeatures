Should GM's All-New 2016 Chevrolet Volt Be Compared To The Tesla Model S? - Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) | Seeking Alpha Oct. 11, 2015  7:50 PM ET  |  About: Tesla Motors (TSLA) , GM , Includes: AAPL , BAMXY , GOOG , GOOGL , NSANY , TM by: Anton Wahlman GM starts deliveries this week of the all-new 2016 Chevrolet Volt 2.0, which is new from the ground up. GM has positioned this EREV (extended range electric vehicle) against Nissan LEAF and Toyota Prius. I believe this to be a mistake. Upon examining the overall performance and sophistication of the all-new Volt, it has more in common with the Tesla Model S. Just study the luxurious interior, the new sharp looks and experience the quiet demeanor of the electric motor. The Voltâ€™s trump card in the Tesla comparison may be Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, which Tesla stubbornly refuses to implement. GM (NYSE: GM ) is back in the electric car game with a new EREV (extended-range electric vehicle) offering that is arriving in dealerships this week - not next year or 2017. And there are reasons it will take away sales from Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA ) Model S. That is, if GM finds a way to market it correctly. The original Volt sold over 82,000 units over five years, from December 2010 until now - plus a small number of Cadillac ELR, which is built on the same platform. When the original 2011-2015 Volt was launched, it was in the wake of the GM bailout, which was followed by the bankruptcy and subsequently GM's IPO. It was an oddball set of historical circumstances alright, and the Volt found itself surprisingly becoming the lightning rod, a political football of sorts, in the center of government bailouts and subsidies. The Volt saw good sales increases in the US starting some time in 2012 and going into 2013, but by 2014 it had fizzled. There was another important ingredient in this failure of the Volt to catch on - aside from the GM bailout-association and the inept marketing - and that was that by 2013-2014 the car itself was getting old in its life cycle. Even though the Volt won almost every "car of the year" award when it launched as a 2011 model, it was trying for something difficult: It was selling to a far more upscale non-truck, non-Corvette buyer than Chevrolet usually does, but the car itself was not as plush - or as good-looking - as the best competition from Germany. The people who were buying a Volt for the first two years, 2011-2012, were mostly the same people - almost all in California, by the way -- who had previously down-scaled one of their garage's Mercedes or BMW ( OTCPK:BAMXY ) sedans to a Toyota (NYSE: TM ) Prius. Aside from interior volume, the Volt was much more capable and a much better car to drive than the Prius, so the Volt became the natural next step for these Prius owners to show that they were "green." Another year, another indulgence. When the Tesla Model S arrived on the scene, however, the Volt was upstaged. The buyers of these cars didn't care whether it cost $35,000 or $135,000, so which one would you buy? Beverly Hills and Silicon Valley quickly shifted their buying patterns from Chevrolet Volt to Tesla Model S. The new refrain became "Muscle car for millionaires" and the Volt was clearly not as much of a muscle car as Tesla, at least if your drive was less than 250 miles long. And by golly, most of the California coastal multi-millionaires with these incomes and net worth, generally don't drive more than 100 miles in any one direction. They fly. It's important to understand another nuance of how the Volt fizzled in this comparison, and that's the interior of the car. The 2011-2015 Volt interior was, on the whole, fairly typical of a $30,000 car at the time: Mostly black plastic, nothing really bad, and certainly better than the Toyota Prius - but once people saw the 17-inch touchscreen in the Tesla, it was all over. The infotainment system in the Volt was nothing special. People who generally don't care whether they drop $35,000 or $135,000 on a car often want something new, something exciting, something to cure their boredom. It could be any number of things - great looks, or some new technology, whether under the hood or inside the cabin. With all of that as background, this brings us to the present time, which is the week that the all-new 2016 Chevrolet Volt 2.0 hits dealerships in California. What's changed with the Volt this time, five years after the first one? I got to take the car out for a few hours, after having driven a friend's Tesla Model S, to see how it compares. Fresh in mind, I had also driven a Toyota Prius (the non-plug in version) and a Nissan ( OTCPK:NSANY ) LEAF, just to make that comparison as well. Of course, I had already driven the 2011 Chevrolet Volt extensively. The first observation is that jumping out of the 2011 Volt into the all-new 2016 Volt was a really huge step in terms of overall refinement. Here are some of the key improvements: Much better-looking car, from every angle. Infotainment system is light-years ahead, with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) CarPlay standard. Acceleration is noticeably faster, with 0-30 MPH in 2.6 seconds. Curb weight is "only" 3,543 lbs, down from 3,786 lbs. Battery range of 53 miles (up from 38), followed by 368 miles of extended range, for a total of 420 miles of range. This should enable more than 90% of trips to be driven on electric wall power, and close to 90% of miles driven, to also be driven on electric wall power. Obviously the Chevrolet Volt is a smaller car than the Tesla Model S. The width of the car is 71.2 inches, or 6 inches narrower than the Tesla's 77.3 inches. So it's a lot easier to park - but it also means that the rear seat space for the middle passenger is a lot less than in the Tesla. Luggage space, while normal for a car of this size, is also less than in the Tesla. For the front seat passengers, however, the big picture is that these two cars are now comparable in terms of luxury, in a way that the 2011 Volt was not. Look at the beautiful two-tone interior of the Volt. Touch the soft and wide center armrest. It is not like the old Volt at all, and it is in some ways better than the much more expensive Tesla. For some people, one reason to get the Volt instead of the Tesla will be Apple CarPlay. It's standard on the Volt, but not available on Tesla. By March 2016, GM will have a software update to enable Android Auto (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), also not available on the Tesla. Earlier this year, Apple announced that CarPlay is coming to 40 models before 2015 is over. What Tim Cook didn't specify was that 33 out of those 40 models in calendar year 2015 are GM cars - and zero from Tesla. GM's partnership with Apple for the automobile of the future may be why Apple has crawled under Elon Musk's skin lately. Of course, not having Apple CarPlay and Android Auto is not necessarily the end of the world if you're a small automaker. There remain both BlackBerry (NASDAQ: BBRY ) and Windows Phone (NASDAQ: MSFT ) users to whom you can appeal for support. How many times haven't we heard "If the company only gets 1% of [ fill in the blank, some large market size ] then we'd be in great shape!" Yes, it's true that you can still pair any phone over Bluetooth with a Tesla, just like you can with any car on the market. However, that's not quite the same as having Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. An old Nokia (NYSE: NOK ) candy-bar phone also made very solid calls. It may even have had a browser and a music player. However, what you're getting with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are access to Android's and Apple's apps, on the screen of your car. You don't think that once the consumer sees the Apple and Android apps, that they are what the consumers are going to want? Tesla could eliminate GM's advantage in a nanosecond by simply partnering with Apple and Google too, just like GM did. They could push a software update to all existing Teslas and this would no longer be Tesla's Achilles heel. But will Tesla do it? Will they cut a deal with Apple and Google? Can they? There are no signs, other than Tesla's official word, which is "no." GM put together two ads for the 2016 Volt, targeting Toyota Prius and Nissan LEAF owners. I think that's a total mis-reading of the market, and a major mistake. Once you have had a chance to spend some time behind the wheel of these cars, you'll realize that the Volt has a better chance at taking share from Tesla, than from Nissan LEAF or Toyota Prius. Of course, all of these cars take some share away from everyone else, but relatively speaking I think Chevrolet is focusing its marketing in the wrong direction. Why make the consumer believe that the all-new 2016 Volt 2.0 plays in the same league of driver sophistication as Nissan LEAF and Toyota Prius? Just look at it, inside and out. Feel the quality of the materials, study the upscale nature of the design - and once you realize that only one of these cars has Apple CarPlay (and is getting a software upgrade to Android Auto), it ought to be clear that the all-new 2016 Volt 2.0 is pointing a lot more in the direction of Tesla. The new Volt will not take away all of Tesla's sales. There remain a few reasons why people would still prefer to pay 2x-4x as much for a Tesla: It is available with all-wheel drive. And granted, many of the Volt's advantages are in the shape of lower costs, that may not matter much, if at all, for the prospective Tesla buyer: The Volt's entire purchase price isn't too different from the first year's depreciation on the Tesla. The Volt can be driven anywhere with ease, so no inducement to own a second car for longer trips. The Volt's overall repair costs are likely going to be lower than Tesla, especially after the Tesla's warranty runs out. With those economic advantages not likely factoring in for the person who cross-shops the new 2016 Volt 2.0 with the Tesla, we are left with the Volt suddenly having caught up - and in some cases exceeded - the Tesla in terms of luxury appointments. If you took away the labels on these two cars and presented them to the novice buyer, asking them which is the more expensive car, you might get a verdict that's closer to 50/50 than you would have thought. Those favoring the Volt in the side-by-side comparison would point to its richer interior appointments and availability of Apple CarPlay, before considering which car is 6 inches easier to park, at a minimum 1,104 lbs lighter, and cost anywhere between half and a quarter the Tesla's price. I can hear the complaints already, from the peanut gallery: "How dare you compare a Chevrolet Volt with a Tesla?" I will remind everyone what was one of the most-cited arguments in favor of the Model S in the early days, 2012-2013: "But did you drive it yet?" In this case, that argument has come full circle and boomerangs: "But did you drive the 2016 Volt yet?"
