At its most simplistic, Double M is facing a future in which she is either fired from her gig or goes down in history as Yahoo’s last CEO. To make it even worse, everyoneÂ seems to be relishing watching her squirm. There was a note-cum-trolling exercise from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Robert Peck speculating on who should replace Mayer. Peck even threw out 10Â names with bios and everything. Ross Levinsohnâ€”served as interim CEO of Yahoo before Mayer, former CEO of Guggenheim Digital Media, former president of Fox Interactive Media Dan Rosensweigâ€”president and CEO of Chegg and former chief operating officer at Yahoo Sheryl Sandbergâ€”chief operating officer of Facebook (though Peck said she was unlikely to leave the social network) Jim Lanzoneâ€”president and CEO of CBS Interactive David Rosenblattâ€”CEO of 1stdibs.com, former CEO of DoubleClick, former president of display advertising at Google Linda Yaccarinoâ€”chairwoman of advertising sales and client partnerships at NBCUniversal The WSJ ratcheted up the intensity of Mayer doom last night: Yahoo Inc.â€™s board is planning a series of meetings this week to consider selling off the companyâ€™s flagging Internet businesses and how to make the most of its valuable stake in Chinese e-commerce powerhouse Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. The board is expected to discuss its options in sessions beginning Wednesday and continuing through Friday, according to people familiar with the plans. Directors are likely to discuss whether to proceed with a plan to spin off its investment in Alibaba, currently worth more than $30 billion, find a buyer for Yahooâ€™s gaggle of Web properties, or both, the people said. With Sheryl Sandberg’s name hanging (albeit limply) above her head, Mayer is apparently going to listen to her board debate whether or not she should be running things like her company’s core business.

She had to have done a really sh!tty job if shareholders are looking to sell off the core business and reinvent itself as a fund management firm, owning only Alibaba and Yahoo Japan.
