Microsoft's Continuum Has Potential To Be Disruptive, But Isn't There Yet - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft has shown a feature which, if properly implemented, could allow it to have a significant chance at cracking the mobile market. However, there are still a couple of obvious things this feature is missing. And, if Microsoft manages to crack the mobile market using this feature, a host of consequences will take place for many different players, Microsoft included. At this point, it's widely known that Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) has bungled the mobile market, leaving it wide open to be conquered by Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) with iOS and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) with Android. That said, Microsoft still holds a commanding lead in the desktop and laptop world, in spite of competition from the same Apple with OSX and Android through Chrome OS. With Windows 10, Microsoft is once again trying to leverage its position in the desktop/laptop world to establish more of a beachhead in the mobile space. Central to that attempt, is Microsoft's Continuum feature. Microsoft's Continuum is a way to take your smartphone and seamlessly turn it into a desktop machine, simply by docking it. This is made possible by Windows 10 and a hardware dock. Windows 10 enables the two interfaces (mobile, desktop) to live within the same OS as well as providing links to the wireless (Bluetooth) keyboard and mouse. The hardware dock provides other connectivity (USB and HDMI ports, power adapter, etc). This feature is also made possible by the continual advancements in smartphone specifications. Today's smartphone is starting to reach even Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) Core M chip performance, whereas Windows 10 runs nicely even on Intel Core 2 CPUs from nearly a decade ago. Also, today's smartphone can easily drive a 1080p display - indeed, many (including the now-launched Lumia 950 and 950XL) ship with even higher resolutions which run smoothly. Finally, flash memory is becoming cheap enough that decent storage capacities can be attained on smartphones. For instance, the latest Microsoft smartphones (again, Lumia 950 and 950XL) are able to use microSD cards of up to 2TB capacities. This feature is obviously attractive for many reasons, including: Desktops and laptops are much more usable when creating or even consuming content while not on the go. Carrying the computer around means all your data is in the same place, with no more syncing chores. The same applications can be available everywhere, with less maintenance required to keep a consistent workspace. The consumer no longer has to keep as many different devices (smartphone, desktop, possibly a laptop), and the components needed to provide the laptop and desktop functions are not exposed to so much of a spec race (display, keyboard, mouse). Looking at what Microsoft presented, there are still obvious flaws with Microsoft's Continuum as proposed: The dock needs to be sexier, plugging cables is not a decent way to go about it. A proper dock where the smartphone is stationed would look better (though it would probably require different models for different smartphones). Have third parties build the docks (would solve previous problem). Most importantly, Microsoft needs to yield to the x86 world. As Continuum was presented, it relied on a phone running on an ARM CPU to give the illusion of a desktop. But this is not full Windows, able to run any Windows application. Instead, it's a derivative of the failed Windows RT, relying on "yet to come" universal apps to have something to run. This is a recipe for failure all by itself, negating all that Microsoft could gain from its Continuum feature. An Intel SoC and full Windows are the only way to guarantee success for this feature. Here, a question is raised. Is Microsoft fully engaged in this attempt? Is Intel? As we'll see, there are consequences from fully pursuing this path. Continuum stands the chance of destroying the general purpose desktop (but not the gaming desktops or those built for highly-demanding applications). Thus, this implies that success for Continuum might drive demand away from other Windows device makers, such as Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ ). Over time, with a variant built for laptops and tablets (similar to the ASUS Padfone ), it can also destroy most of the market for general purpose laptops (again, excluding gaming laptops or those built for highly-demanding applications). More problematic, while this technology can allow Microsoft to finally invade the mobile market, such would come at the cost of a large slice of its own Windows business. This would be so because mobile devices carry very low-priced mobile licenses for Windows, versus more expensive OEM licenses for desktops and laptops. But for it to be attractive Continuum needs to carry the full Windows experience. So by winning, Microsoft would be losing some of its own high-margin OEM desktop/laptop licenses. Even Intel has something of a problem. Due to competition from ARM vendors, any chip designed towards mobiles is bound to be much cheaper and lower-margin than its Intel Core M chips. Yet, to make the Continuum feature work to its fullest potential, the device needs to be able to run full Windows. And this requires Intel to match the ARM chips which are already matching its Core M CPUs. This means deeply cannibalizing its CPU line. Intel might have a resistance to this, same as Microsoft might have a resistance to providing full Windows on the smartphone, even if it's able to. At this point, I wonder to what extent "What Is Still Missing" is due to the "Consequences". But the fact here is rather simple, if the feature is half-baked so that it doesn't produce the "Consequences", then it will also be very likely to fail and be irrelevant. That is, for this to work it can't be built on compromises designed to make it less useful and to make it not be the desktop/laptop replacement it supposedly aims to be. This, let it be said, should already be obvious to Microsoft, given how Windows RT bombed. Why Is It Important For Microsoft To Get Continuum Right The mobile revolution is not going to stop, and for the most part, Microsoft already lost that train. Continuum, properly done, could be the way for Microsoft to get back into the game. This would be especially true because none of the two major competitors (Android, iOS) have the possibility to do the same (at this point in time). Android could conceivably do a similar job but you'd end up with a Chrome OS desktop. iOS could try doing the same, but you'd end up with a laptop/desktop running iOS instead of OSX. Only Microsoft can deliver the still-leading desktop/laptop platform - running Windows. But perhaps if Microsoft aims for that, some of its business model will intrinsically change. After all, if Microsoft is successful, it will spell a significant reduction in OEM Windows licenses, replaced by a larger market share in mobile. How would Microsoft monetize that? Here, it would seem that the only way out would be to ape Apple's business model: make the money on hardware, not the software. Indeed, fully copying Apple would mean even more: Microsoft would have to aim at making the money from the high-end device segment. Alas, there is at least a measure of indication that Microsoft might be trying just that, not only with the Surface tablet and the new Phones (Lumia 950, 950XL) but also with its recently unveiled Surface Book. Here, something else should be considered - Continuum will pressure the existing Windows ecosystem suppliers on the low-end as the smartphones will be able to take on those jobs. At the same time, the high-end device strategy would push on the suppliers servicing the high-end of the Windows market. This could be a significant problem. If Continuum is properly implemented, it could change the nature of the entire PC market. Microsoft's continuum might be its best chance ever of reentering the mobile race. This would be achieved by making your smartphone the center of your computing experience, which is a reasonable feat for today's smartphones in regular usage. The smartphone would power your desktop and laptop, all while keeping all your data and applications in a single device. Such a chance, however, would require a significant change in Microsoft's business model, and it might also have significant impacts on many other players servicing the PC and laptop markets. Namely, it could happen that those players would be pushed out of the ecosystem both from the low- and high-end device sides, except for niche applications (professional, gaming, etc). Also, it will require courage from Microsoft, because a half-baked attempt at implementing Continuum without full Windows functionality will make it a lot less likely to be successful. Right now, Microsoft seems to be leaning this way, which will mean "failure". But if Microsoft shifts to full Windows on the smartphone, success in the mobile space could be within reach, changing both the mobile and PC markets significantly.
