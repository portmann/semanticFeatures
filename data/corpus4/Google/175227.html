Apple: Is GoPro A Compelling Acquisition Target? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha GoPro has received analyst and investor attention as a possible Apple acquisition. Historically, Apple has acquired companies for talent and intellectual property rather than for inorganic growth. GoPro's forthcoming airborne drones may attract Apple as part of a general interest in robotics. Northland analyst Gus Richard recently characterized GoPro (NASDAQ: GPRO ) as a "compelling acquisition target for Apple" (NASDAQ: AAPL ). Motley Fool's Leo Sun has presented his case for an Apple acquisition. Although there's a case to be made for acquisition, it would be out of character for Apple. Apple may well want to expand into robotics, however, and for that iRobot (NASDAQ: IRBT ) would be a better fit. GoPro's stock has been taking a beating in the past month, down nearly 40%, so this may in part be fueling the speculation of an Apple purchase. Since Richard's comment on Monday, the stock is up 10% as of Wednesday's close Also, there's been a long standing perception that GoPro and Apple might be on a collision course (see my GoPro: Apple Is Not The Threat ). Certainly, GoPro investors would rather join Apple than try to beat it. There's a tendency to see a GoPro acquisition as analogous to the Beats acquisition, and this is the crux of Sun's case for it. He points to GoPro's action cameras and video ecosystems as "natural extensions" of Apple iOS hardware and ecosystem. Sun is right, of course, but then the same could be said of many consumer electronics products that Apple doesn't make, such as home theater systems or electronic musical instruments. A GoPro acquisition runs afoul of principles that have guided Apple acquisitions since Tim Cook became COO under Steve Jobs. The key principle is not to pursue growth for the sake of growth. The corollary to this is to only seek acquisitions that enhance Apple's core business by adding talent and intellectual property. So Apple could go around buying up all sorts of consumer electronics companies, but it's not doing that. If Beats had consisted only of the headphone and speaker business, I'm sure Apple wouldn't have bothered. It was Beats Music that Apple wanted because it knew that the future of its iTunes content business was in subscription streaming. GoPro falls outside of Apple's core business of personal computing devices of various sorts. Except for Beats, Apple hasn't wanted to venture much into accessories, preferring to feature other company's accessories in its stores, as it does with GoPro. Sun also makes the argument that GoPro would be relatively cheap, about $6 billion with an acquisition premium. This would actually be a large part of Apple's domestic cash holding, estimated to be about $22 billion. $6 billion would be a lot for Apple to spend on a non-core business for the sake of growth it doesn't need. If the above considerations were the only ones in play, I would probably have formulated the title of this article as an assertion rather than a question. My doubts about a GoPro acquisition revolve around its recently announced intention to produce personal aerial drones. Drones are a logical extension of GoPro's business. Apple appears to have, along with much of the consumer electronics industry, an interest in robotics. Robots are fundamentally computing devices, so they fit within Apple's core competency. Robots also have the potential to be incredibly useful for people, and therefore a huge potential market. The much rumored self-driving Apple Car project can be thought of as just the most obvious form of consumer robot as well as the most expensive. Another important form of overlap between robotics and Apple's core business stems from the fact that it's still very difficult for robots to carry around enough smarts to be useful. The obvious solution is to rely on cloud computing to provide the artificial intelligence that robots need. Apple and its competitors such as Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) already do that for their "robot" assistants such as Siri. Next to a self driving car, autonomous or semi-autonomous airborne drones are possibly the most desirable consumer robots and the most likely to appear in mass use in the near future. Drones, properly endowed with cloud-based smarts, could be useful for more than taking a cool new type of selfie. Drones could run errands, picking up or dropping off small packages. They also could provide remote surveillance of children or look for lost children or pets. Of course, the utility of drones will depend on establishment of regulations and infrastructure conducive to their use. Development of an air traffic control system for drones may pose a considerable technical hurdle that limits the use of autonomous drones. GoPro's development of drones could be the factor that tips the scale in favor of an acquisition. However, Apple might want something a little closer to home, literally, and a lot more affordable. Given Apple's recent push into the home through iOS connected devices such as light dimmers and thermostats, iRobot might be a better choice. iRobot isn't as profitable as GoPro . In the June quarter, GoPro had operating income of $46 million on revenue of 420 million, while iRobot had $11 million in operating income on revenue of $149 million. GoPro also is growing much faster with 72% y/y revenue growth vs. 6% for iRobot. But, once again, Apple doesn't usually acquire companies for their revenue streams. iRobot's little Roomba vacuum cleaners aren't as sexy as drones or even action cameras, but iRobot also has some other interesting products such as the Ava Mobile Robotics Platform , which is endowed with considerably greater intelligence. At a market cap of only $905 million, iRobot is considerably more affordable than GoPro. It's also such a good fit as the next i-device. Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL.
