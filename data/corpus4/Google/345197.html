Apple's New Pragmatism - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple's March 21 event featured smaller, more affordable versions of iPhone and iPad Pro. Both devices were priced very competitively for their feature sets. For years, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has claimed that it "only wanted to build the best possible iPhone," in an oft repeated mantra. With the arrival of the iPhone SE at Apple's March special event, designed specifically to be a more affordable model, that mantra finally has been discarded. The SE offers premium features at a bargain starting price of $399. While the new SE may not move the needle much this quarter, Apple's shift in product strategy will have an impact for years to come. Apple achieved something with the SE that even I didn't expect. It packed most of the premium features of the iPhone 6s, with the exception of 3D Touch and a large screen, into a phone with a surprisingly low price point. So it wouldn't be correct to say that Apple is moving down market, but it is increasing its total addressable market, which is really the point of offering a variety of form factors and price points. That total addressable market appears to be not as small as analysts have assumed. At Apple's March 21 special event, Apple stated that it had sold 30 million 4-inch iPhones in 2015. This is double the predicted sales for the revamped iPhone SE, according to Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital . I think it's reasonable to assume that the greatly enhanced SE will at least equal the 30 million number. The SE offers the A9 processor and NFC based Apple Pay of the iPhone 6s as well as the new 4k video capable 12 Mpixel camera. Apple saves money by continuing to use the case, screen and probably battery from the old 5s. 3D Touch was not included since this would have required a new screen to accommodate the pressure sensors, and there was no room for the Taptic Engine anyway. Overall, Apple's design choices for the SE represent a good compromise. Yes, I still think the A9 is overkill for such a small screen, but use of the A9 was probably driven by considerations of economies of scale in A9 production. Now that TSMC (NYSE: TSM ) has fully ramped their 16 nm FinFET production, using the A9 probably was more cost effective than using the older A8 based on TSMC's 20 nm process. Has Apple given up any margin on the SE? Possibly, compared to the 5s. Basically, the SE is a 5s with a new circuit card assembly and camera. The new circuit card is probably a drop in replacement for the 5s, and manufacturing cost difference would be minimal. If economies of scale favored the use of the A9 over the A8 (plus M8 motion coprocessor, a separate chip), then probably using the A9 was not much more expensive than the A7 in the 5s. The upgraded 12 Mpixel camera might have been the most expensive part of the upgrade. Estimates of component costs are available from IHS and Techinsights. I have previously argued that the total cost to manufacture the iPhone that these outfits come up with is too low. However, they might be reasonable at the component level. IHS estimated in September 2013 the cost for the iPhone 5s of the A7 processor and M7 motion coprocessor at $19, with the cameras estimated at $13. Techinsights puts the A9 processor in the iPhone 6s at about $40 and the cameras at $19. The cost delta of $27 is probably more due to the fact that the estimates came from different sources, but it gives you a feel for the magnitude of the cost increase for the SE. It's not much. In my article, The Myth of Enormous iPhone Profitability , I concluded that iPhone gross margin is about 45%, higher than Apple's corporate average, but not enormously so. Applying this gross margin to the $399 base price yields an all-inclusive cost to Apple of $219.45, not too far away from the IHS total manufacturing cost of the 16 GB iPhone 5s of $198.70 from September 2013. I think it's likely that Apple is holding close to their historical iPhone margin of 45%. The other half of the important product announcements at the March 21 event was the new 9.7-inch iPad Pro. The small iPad Pro came with just about everything that was expected: the A9X processor from its larger Pro sibling, provisions for a smart detachable keyboard and Apple Pencil, and the quad speaker arrangement. The biggest surprise, and a much welcome one, was the inclusion of the 12 Mpixel camera from the iPhone 6s, along with a flash. A flash for the iPad camera has been long overdue. Alas, the new Pro camera lacks the optical image stabilization of the 6s Plus. I really like the new iPad Pros. They are the best iPads Apple has ever produced. But I wish Apple would stop claiming that iPad Pro is a PC replacement. Tim Cook had stated when the Pro was released that it "is a replacement for the notebook or a desktop for many, many people." Apple has apparently decided to double down on the claim. Unfortunately, it just doesn't wash for many professionals. Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Surface Pro 4 is a much better and more capable replacement for the traditional PC. Windows 10 is rather ungainly in its combination of desktop and tablet user interfaces, but Surface Pro provides a set of capabilities that iPad Pro simply can't match. This is the current reality. I see where Apple is coming from, though. As I've been pointing out, Apple's strategy is to position iOS/iPad as the new personal computing platform. So the claim that iPad Pro is a PC replacement is more a statement of intent and future direction. But iOS will need to continue to evolve into a much more capable platform before it can be truly a PC replacement. We're seeing signs of a similar positioning of Android by Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google to be a PC alternative, as I pointed out in Is Google's Android The Next PC Platform? We now have what appears to be a three-way race between the major operating system vendors - Microsoft, Apple and Google - to become the next dominant PC platform. The outcome of that race is by no means certain. But I give a slight edge to Android. This pains me somewhat to say it, but Google possesses a certain intellectual flexibility and agility that Apple has lacked. This isn't an age thing (Apple will be 40-years-old on April 1). This isn't even a Tim Cook thing. This is a ghost of Steve Jobs thing. Apple is still trying to give us its vision of what it considers "best" in computing. We were told at the event that the iPad Pro represents Apple's vision of the future of personal computing. I think Apple is on the right track, but it's a vision that still needs some work. I'm sure that many will wonder after hearing me complain like this why I'm still an Apple investor. Well, for one thing, no company is perfect. Apple has flaws, but it also has tremendous strengths. And I'm willing to make allowances for the fact that creative people have a need to pursue their unique visions. Most importantly, even when Apple goes off on a tangent, the company's leadership has been able to course correct successfully. After stubbornly claiming that the 4-inch screen of the iPhone 5 and 5s was the "best" size, Apple eventually gave in to market pragmatism and produced the iPhone 6. In that vein, I expect Apple to converge iOS to a true personal computing platform in time. Market pragmatism was really the fundamental story behind the March event. It's market pragmatism that motivated Apple to produce the low-cost iPhone SE. It's market pragmatism that has driven the introduction of the smaller, lower cost iPad Pro. While I don't expect either the iPhone SE or the new iPad Pro to have much impact on the March quarter, the new pragmatism and willingness to compete on price are exactly what Apple needs to propel its future growth. And it's really market pragmatism that is driving Apple to position iOS as its preferred personal computing platform. iOS is far larger and more profitable than Mac could ever be. iOS has a huge ecosystem of apps that are all channeled and taxed through the iOS App Store. The profits from the iOS ecosystem can fuel its blossoming into a competitive, if not dominant, personal computing platform. I remain long Apple and consider it a buy.
