Yahoo's Cashless Spin-Off Has Strong Business Purposes: Employee Options And Merger Currency - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha Yahoo's 15% ownership of Alibaba accounts for a staggering 87% of YHOO's market capitalization. The company is spinning off its Alibaba stock to correct a distortion in the Yahoo stock price. The distortion is inhibiting the company's ability to compete in the market, both for talented employees and attractive strategic merger partners/targets. The IRS has concluded in published guidance that there is a substantial non-tax business purpose for a spin-off when it is the only way to... ...issue equity compensation that is directly tied to the value of the company, thereby attracting or retaining key employees. The IRS has recognized the goal of maximizing the value of a company's stock as acquisition currency as a business purpose that satisfies the tax-free spin-off rules. The following adaptation of a letter to the editor from the July 28th edition of Tax Notes has been expanded to include the above summary. Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) is spinning off its Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) stock to correct a distortion in the Yahoo stock price that is inhibiting its ability to compete in the market, both for talented employees and attractive strategic merger partners/targets.[i] As of the close of trading today, Yahoo's 15% ownership of Alibaba accounted for 87% of Yahoo's market capitalization.[ii] 1. Suppose one of America's best corporate citizens, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A ) (NYSE: BRK.B ), wanted to spin-off its appreciated American Express (NYSE: AXP ) stock, and added its smaller Borsheim's Fine Jewelry business to the mix, which is assumed for the purposes of these examples to be an active trade or business under the spin-off tax rules. The transaction would be taxable if there was no substantial business purpose for the spin-off other than an attempt to avoid corporate-level tax on the distribution of the appreciated American Express stock. When Warren Buffett was actually asked about the Alibaba spin-off during the question-and-answer session of the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting this past year, he (understandably) expressed some skepticism about whether it could be accomplished tax-free. 2. Imagine, instead, that Berkshire Hathaway was trading at only the value of its American Express holding, and it spun-off its American Express stock with the Borsheim's Fine Jewelry business. This transaction may have a substantial non-tax business purpose if conducted to correct the distortion in the Berkshire Hathaway stock price so that, for example, Berkshire could issue equity awards or use its stock as acquisition currency (as recognized by the IRS itself, discussed below). Assuming that Borsheim's comprises an active trade or business and provided the other requirements for a tax-free spin-off are satisfied, the transaction would qualify for tax-free treatment.[iii] Yahoo's position resembles that of Berkshire Hathaway in the second example because of Alibaba's overwhelming effect on the Yahoo share price. Specifically, the Yahoo spin-off has the following business purposes that have been recognized by the IRS as strong business purposes supporting tax-free treatment. These business purposes are not only powerful non-tax motivations for the transaction, they are exigent issues crippling Yahoo's ability to conduct business that need to be rectified as quickly as possible. 1. Yahoo expenses approximately $100 million per quarter for employee stock options, and is having a hard time attracting top talent to drive a turnaround of its business. In part, this is because the value of the Yahoo stock is driven by its Alibaba holding, meaning that a talented Yahoo employee may be unable to realize appreciation in the value of their Yahoo stock options as a direct result of their hard work to improve the business. Without the ability to incentivize and reward employee innovation, Yahoo has struggled to attract the talent that it needs. For example, assume that a talented Yahoo employee is issued an option to acquire its stock at a fixed price, and as a result of their innovation and hard work, the company's earnings rise. At the same time, however, the stock price of Alibaba falls by an offsetting amount due to events wholly outside of the employee's control, and this causes the Yahoo stock price to drop, because it overpowers the effect of its positive earnings growth. Instead of seeing their contribution to the company rewarded with growth in the Yahoo stock price, the employee's options have actually lost value despite their good efforts. Under these perverse circumstances, if you were a talented computer programmer considering competing job offers in Silicon Valley, would you prefer the stock option package at Yahoo over a similar one from Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) or perhaps a start-up? In the latter two cases, you have a better chance to see your work add value to the share price, but not necessarily so at Yahoo. In Silicon Valley, stock options that grow in value with the business are considered standard compensation for employees, and the fact that YHOO cannot credibly provide this incentive is hurting its ability to compete in the job market. By spinning off its Alibaba stock, Yahoo can attract and incentivize industry-leading employees that are drawn to the ability to reap the benefits of increasing the fortunes of the company. The IRS has concluded in published guidance that there is a substantial non-tax business purpose for a spin-off when it is the only way to issue equity compensation that is directly tied to the value of the company, thereby attracting or retaining key employees.[iv] 2. One key way to grow in Yahoo's industry is through acquisitions, and in such deals, it is common to use equity consideration. A strategic partner today looking to take advantage of the synergies arising from growing its business with Yahoo would be less likely to want Yahoo stock whose value fluctuates based not on the growth of the combined business operations, but rather the fortunes of Alibaba. Yahoo has cut 1/3 of its contractors and laid off more than 10% of its workforce this year. Troubled as it may be, the company still generates one billion unique visitors per day, and its top priority is to return to growth as quickly as possible. A large acquisition could offer a path back to profitability, but it would have to be an all-cash deal given the current disruption in the Yahoo stock price that is caused by the company's Alibaba holding. According to Bloomberg data, Yahoo has acquired 129 other companies since its formation for $19.4 billion in total consideration. Twelve large, strategic, all-stock deals account for $9.2 billion (48%) of this $19.4 billion figure. Forty-two smaller all-cash deals account for $7.5 billion (39%) of the $19.4 billion, and three stock-and-cash deals account for $2.4 billion (12%). Finally, 72 small transactions whose terms were not disclosed make up the remaining 1% of the $19.4 billion. Therefore, in 60% of Yahoo's acquisitions, and in nearly all of its large, transformative deals, the company has primarily paid in its own stock. As of the second quarter of 2015, Yahoo held a cash position of roughly $7 billion ($5.8 billion net of convertible debt). In the first quarter of this year, the company announced a $2 billion share repurchase program and has bought back $203 million of stock in 2015 to date. The company has an exigent need to effect a strategic transaction to reverse its fortunes, but is restricted to the use of cash consideration. Yahoo ought to be able to follow its historical pattern of using its own stock as consideration, but as described above, its stock is currently unattractive as an acquisition currency because its price fluctuates based on Alibaba stock rather than the value generated from a strategic transaction. By far the best solution to this urgent problem is to decouple the Yahoo stock from the Alibaba stock so that a potential strategic partner, or the shareholders of a strategic target, is willing to take Yahoo stock as an acquisition currency that will appreciate from the combined synergistic value arising from combining YHOO and its potential target or partner. Otherwise, the company becomes the proverbial sitting duck, a target for an acquirer that can efficiently unwind the Alibaba stake on behalf of the combined company. Even an all-stock merger of equals would be challenging. In light of Verizon's (NYSE: VZ ) recent $4 billion acquisition of AOL, nothing short of Yahoo's ability to control its own destiny is at stake. The IRS has recognized the goal of maximizing the value of a company's stock as acquisition currency as a business purpose that satisfies the tax-free spin-off rules.[v] Yahoo is spinning off its Alibaba stock to correct a distortion in its stock price that is crippling the company's ability to turn around its business. That distortion is inhibiting Yahoo's ability to compete in the market, both for talented employees and attractive strategic merger partners/targets. The IRS has repeatedly recognized that correcting this type of issue is a strong business purpose for tax-free spin-off treatment. [i] The tax law in question (section 355) states: A distribution that is expected to cause the aggregate value of the stock of a distributing corporation and the stock of a controlled corporation to exceed the pre-distribution value of the distributing corporation's stock satisfies the corporate business purpose requirement of § 355 and § 1.355-2(b) when the increased value is expected to serve a corporate business purpose of either the distributing corporation or the controlled corporation (or both), even if it benefits the shareholders of the distributing corporation. [ii] As of July 23rd, 2015, Alibaba closed at $83.88 and Yahoo closed at $39.21. There is $83.88 of Alibaba stock x 0.4066 = $34.11 worth of Alibaba stock inside each share of Yahoo stock. Therefore, 87% of the current Yahoo stock price consists of Alibaba stock (i.e. $34.11/$39.21). [iii] This same reasoning would apply even if Berkshire traded for somewhat more than the combined value of a much larger basket of its liquid holdings, but still at a price that was sufficiently depressed to cause problems of the type that have given rise to business purposes recognized by the IRS as sufficient for tax-free spin-off treatment. (Apologies to Mr. Buffett for any agita related to our referencing Berkshire in this discussion.) [iv] See Rev. Rul. 2004-23, Situation 1.
