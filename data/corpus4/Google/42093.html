Learn more about PRO » Google Fi's flat-rate data pricing makes wireless data similar to utilities like water or electricity. If flat-rate data pricing becomes standard, Verizon would lose billions in revenue that it currently gets due to customers paying for unused data each month. Verizon's wireless margins are highly inflated by customers paying for this unused data. Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) is out to change how U.S. consumers think of data plans. A consequence of this shift? Verizon's (NYSE: VZ ) wireless margins could be destroyed. There's been a lot of discussion about Google Fi since it launched last week - both on Seeking Alpha and across the web. Much of that discussion has focused on the potential of Google Fi to undercut carriers , or whether Fi will be meaningful for Google's bottom line . Both of these ideas miss the actual potential of the service. Google isn't trying to establish itself as a major carrier (at least at the moment). It's trying to push people into viewing data as a basic commodity, in the way people currently think of water or electricity. One of the main talking points for Google Fi is its promise to refund customers each month for any unused data on its plan. This alone would be a huge step forward for customers, but it's not the most radical aspect of Fi's pricing. The most important announcement (and one of the least covered so far), is its policy on what happens if you need additional data: That means if customers go over their selected data plan, they aren't penalized with throttled speeds - as AT&T (NYSE: T ) and T-Mobile (NYSE: TMUS ) do - or charged inflated overage fees as Verizon does. Most importantly, it means that a customer could sign up for Google Fi, select the lowest data plan at $10 per month, and treat the service as a pay-as-you-go system, with no repercussions. They can use as much or little as they want, and pay the same rate. Again, this essentially puts wireless data on a pricing system akin to utilities. For U.S. consumers, this is an overdue change. For the large carriers - and I'm going to focus on Verizon in particular here - such a shift poses a huge threat. Why Verizon's wireless margins are so high To understand why pay-as-you-go or flat-rate data pricing would be bad news for Verizon, we need to look at its margins. Verizon currently has great margins on its wireless business. For Q1, its total wireless EBITDA margin was 44.8%. Its operating margin was 35%. One of the main things supporting this is the fact that most customers are paying Verizon for data they don't use, every month. According to the most recent report from mobile intelligence firm Validas, the average cell phone user has $27.86 in unused data left over at the end of the month per cellphone line. That equals $334.32 per line per year for Verizon (which unlike T-Mobile or AT&T doesn't allow customers to roll-over any data). If flat-rate pricing like the kind Google Fi is offering becomes standard, Verizon's operating profit will take a serious hit. Let's look at the numbers, using Validas's estimate (which, as a calculation across carriers, could be slightly higher or lower for Verizon-specific customers). Verizon has approximately 68.7 million smartphone connections, according to its Q1 earnings call . (I'm going to leave tablets and other devices out of this analysis, as the data-use patterns are likely different). If the average Verizon customer is paying $27.86 per month per line for unused data, that means Verizon is collecting $1.9 billion a month because of this mismatch, or $5.7 billion a quarter. Over a full year, that's just under $23 billion. Removing the $5.74 billion in revenue from unused data drops Verizon's Q1 operating revenue from $22.3 billion to $16.6 billion. Its operating margin drops from 35% to 13%. Looking at the numbers, it appears Verizon derives a significant amount of its revenue from customers paying for unused data and relies on this mismatch to support its inflated margins. As consumers and the industry transition away from the tiered data plans that enabled this discrepancy, Verizon will see significant losses. Such a transition won't happen instantly. Google Fi is currently limited to one phone and relies on the smaller coverage maps of T-Mobile and Sprint (NYSE: S ) for its infrastructure. However, Google has also shown the ability to spur significant change in established industries. Its success in advancing widespread Gigabit Internet infrastructure via Google Fiber is a testament to this. Regardless of how quickly Google Fi itself takes off, Verizon's current wireless margins are likely unsustainable long term. Flat-rate data pricing will eventually become the standard, as innovative carriers seek new ways to attract customers and gain a competitive advantage. When evaluating the situation, investors would do well to keep in mind Jeff Bezos' popular quote "your margin is my opportunity." In this case, Verizon's margins are Google's opportunity. Short Verizon. The company's wireless business accounted for over 90% of its operating revenue in Q1, and a large percentage of this is due to a price mismatch caused by tiered data plans. As flat-rate data pricing becomes standard, this discrepancy will disappear and Verizon's wireless margins will significantly decline.
