Can Fantasy Sports Save Yahoo? - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha YHOO teams up with Draft Kings, Fan Duel to create daily fantasy sports league on site. Will be entering a near $250M industry that could potentially grow to $1-2B by 2020. In addition to live streaming NFL game planned for this fall, YHOO can gain competitive advantage in both streaming entertainment and fantasy sports. Poor Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ), once the toast of Silicon Valley has been in a long decline, ravaged by the likes of Google and whose market capitalization is largely due to the successful investment in Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) long ago. With the spinoff of Alibaba shares coming later this year, Yahoo is in need of serious soul searching as it looks to stay at least somewhat viable. The newest strategy announced this week was to renew its interest in fantasy sports with a deal struck with Draft Kings and Fan Duel to create a cash-betting fantasy league. While some may think that this is another example of Yahoo throwing stuff at the wall to see what sticks, getting into a rapidly growing fantasy sports industry could be the turning point for the company in terms of user engagement and revenue. With this deal, Yahoo will be a player in one of the hottest trends in online gaming, and since fantasy sports is considered a "game of skill", it avoids most state and federal restrictions on gambling. According to an industry study by the Fantasy Sports Trade Association (FSTA), 14% of Americans participate in fantasy sports, representing 56.8 million players, a 36.5% increase from 2014. Of these players, 60% play in pay leagues, spending over $465 per year on league fees, pools, and fantasy sports materials such as draft boards and insider guides. Most important for Yahoo, roughly $257 out of the $465 spent by the average player is on daily games, which is the specialty of Draft Kings and Fan Duel. Daily spending now represents 55% of total fantasy spending, up from 6.25% in 2012. This provides Yahoo with a strong initial source of revenue in a market that is attracting more players, and more money, each year. In addition to the current strength of the daily fantasy market, some analysts are predicting exponential growth in the years ahead. According to Eilers Research , daily fantasy sports leagues could generate $1-2 billion in revenue by 2020, up from roughly $250 million expected this calendar year. With an expected quadrupling of the potential revenue, Yahoo is getting in right at the cusp of a breakout, entitling it a certain advantage over rivals like ESPN that manage seasonal leagues. While this could change as more companies jump on the daily fantasy sports bandwagon, Yahoo would still be able to carve out a niche for itself that makes it unique rather than previous attempts at trying to follow the crowd. The new daily fantasy league deal will also kick in at the same time Yahoo hosts the first NFL game streamed exclusively online to a national audience this fall. While the game itself isn't expected to be a marquee match-up (Jacksonville vs. Buffalo), it will serve as an important test to see how live sports can work in a world that is increasingly turning off cable, as well as give Yahoo a chance to see how well it can host this kind of stream. If this proves successful, Yahoo will be able to use this to differentiate its streaming capabilities from the likes of Hulu and Netflix, and could complement its restructured fantasy sports offerings through the creation of a sports ecosystem. It won't have the same effect as the NFL's partnership with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) for monitoring fantasy teams while the game plays live over cable, but it is still a test of the internet's capabilities to handle a live sporting event at the quality fans expect. If successful, it could hasten the growth of streaming entertainment, and Yahoo would be in the best position to take advantage of it. Either by coincidence or by design, all three of these events will either begin or conclude this fall. After Yahoo formally spins off its Alibaba shares, investors will know what the company is really worth, and could probably look to the upcoming football season to see how Yahoo handles its two newest additions. Given the impact the fantasy leagues and NFL stream will have in the shrunken company, it could make Yahoo a cheap buying opportunity. Fantasy football is easily the most popular sport for players, and with effective mobile integration, Yahoo stands to win big. It may not be the company's traditional areas of expertise, but changes need to be made, and this could be one change that makes the company stands apart. Source: Can Fantasy Sports Save Yahoo?
