Facebook: M Means Money - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Facebook is out with a new personal assistant called "M." I believe M could be huge - we'll have to wait and see. I make the case that M and several previous announcements are reasons to bet on the long end of Facebook's maturation curve with leverage. Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) is out with a new development, "M," which is yet another beta product that has incredibly far-reaching, totally (overused but entirely true in this instance word coming) disruptive potential, and yet can also be a perfectly fitting overlay to the broader Facebook platform - inclusive of Whatsapp, Instagram, Mentions, etc. Facebook is getting really, really good at managing its stock and M is just another indication of this. Both the equity management and the product innovation at Facebook are reasons why I continue to hold long-dated CALL options rather than Facebook common. M is Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Siri, Google's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Now, Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Cortana, etc. But it isn't. Yes M is a personal assistant but it isn't just that - M also has a human element. That's right, real humans that may or may not be acting as M behind the scenes. Facebook currently employs an unknown number of "M Trainers" that sometimes proceed to take a user request through the entire lifecycle without the "algo-M" having anything to do with the request. That's right, your own free personal concierge. Facebook is doing this on the front end to accomplish several things. The first is to help better train "algo-M," well - what I'll refer to as algo-M, on nuances in language and on being more predictive, faster, easier to use, etc. Of course, despite the overhead (which we'll break out soon), I think this is a really, really smart idea. It's easier to not annoy and alienate users while at the same time becoming completely useless to them on the front end than it is to do this and then beg users to come back on the back end. American Express, you should call Facebook and ask it why it's doing things in this order rather than the other way around (oh, but we'll break this out soon too). M's goal is to be the "go to" starting point for users when on a mobile device and in need of something - most of us currently use a fragmented flow chart of options that include Siri, Google search, or maybe a particular app depending on use case (for instance, Yelp for restaurant reviews, etc.). Facebook wants M to be the default starting point for search and discovery when mobile. You can imagine why. The thing is, if Facebook is serious about this - and all indications are that it is, M already has capacity that none of the other personal assistants have. That's if you think about it as-is with no further learning or evolution. The fact that any machine-recognized errors or requests that it doesn't understand get sent to a human rather than a Siri response of, "I'm sorry, I can't help with that right now," is a huge differentiator. I think M is brilliant. As with all things Facebook, which the questions are always relevant, when will this be monetized, what about the overhead, and what are economics? Considering Facebook is employing at least a small contingent of M Trainers, you can imagine the overhead associated with this project is large on the front end. That said, to justify the risk and the investment, the economics better be really, really good on the back end maturation of the product and/or we better be getting to these economics quick. Not that Facebook doesn't have cash to burn or access to credit, but investors always are and always should be worried about the bottom line. First, I want to say that scaling the M Trainer initiative doesn't make sense. Let's just get that out of the way. There's no way that Facebook is going to employ the many thousands of M Trainers it would take to help service billions of users. It's just not realistic, at least not alone. Second, I want to say that I don't think M Trainers are a long-term initiative. As they present a scale issue and hopefully at some point the algo-M will have learned a thing or two from its human counterpart, I just don't see the M Trainers not being moved out for a much smaller contingent of developers. So it's my assumption that the economics of this endeavor (I'm sure the initiative is money losing currently) are never going to be worse than they are right now. This is fine, for now. But what about economics of the future? And what if Facebook could hang on to a large M Trainer base on somebody else's dime? Now, we're talking. I think this is the way that M shapes up in the future. I think, as with Businesses on Messenger, M is really being developed as a non-consumer function. Really, consider that. I think that M is Facebook's next evolution of Businesses on Messenger and its way to define a new non-consumer vertical for customer service (quite obviously I would think). I mean, think about it. If Facebook's M is going to be recommending restaurants, buying apparel items for people, calling to set up cable at a new residence (which it can do - M can literally hold the line for you and work the automated phone dialer systems) doesn't it make sense that Facebook (eventually) require some form of reimbursement for flowing traffic to particular vendors? Or wouldn't it make sense for Facebook to allow for preferential recommendation by M for a small fee? Or, maybe best of all, doesn't it make sense for businesses to build out their own customer service teams (read: M Trainers Lite) to service traffic being relevantly flowed to them? I think it does. If a user asks M, "what is the best credit card to use for travel benefits?", and M responds, "American Express Platinum," (please refrain from tarring and feathering me) doesn't American Express want to seamlessly and without the user being notified take human control of M within the conversation once the user decides to proceed into the recommendation? I think depending on M-driven volume, it certainly does. I think American Express would pay handsomely for the opportunity to help destress the Facebook transactional volume. And so like I said, I think that's the future of M Trainers. Companies hiring out customer service teams as they do with Zendesk (NYSE: ZEN ) powered Businesses on Messenger. Facebook is the platform - the businesses are the execution. This, if I'm right, should perpetuate M's human-element differentiation and continue to make M the premier customer service/personal assistant app in the tech universe. If M has human controllers and nobody else does, does anybody else even have a personal assistant app? I don't think they do and that's the point trying to be made by Facebook. So view the Facebook economics of M as you will, but realize that I don't think the economics do anything but get better. Making this doubly attractive, I don't think the value prop of M ever does anything but get better. As M scales up and potentially as M builds out its M Trainer base (potentially not on Facebook's dime), the overall learning of the algo will only get better and better. My assumption is that to be allowed to play, businesses are going to have to give Facebook access to all "conversational" data from all transactions. That's a literal Twitterverse (NYSE: TWTR ) sized, real-time data flow that will help M learn and learn and learn (this cadence continues on into perpetuity). My advice would be, as with all things Facebook, don't be a prisoner of the moment to M economics. Focus on the long play here, I think it's going to be huge. But, again as with all things Facebook, the economics of M aren't and shouldn't be viewed as being limited to M itself. Everything Facebook does, in my opinion, it does in an effort to make more holistic its model, to make its model more defensive, or to make its model more an ecosystem of capture. Facebook's primary goal with everything isn't upfront economics, it's time on platform. With scale and with volume, everything can become economic. It's the time on its platform across the ecosystem which Facebook sells to advertisers and marketers. What algo-M's learnings can do is better improve everything at Facebook. They can help Facebook's News Feed algo make better recommendations which will (data has shown) improve engagement, time on platform, and overall user satisfaction. They can help Whatsapp's auto correct better work with new slang. They can help Instagram's Discovery mechanism help make better recommendations for both users and brands. They can help deliver Instant Articles to the most relevant feeds - driving the efficacy of Facebook's content delivery engine. The uses are nearly endless. Imagine being offered a menu of photos from a prospective restaurant that M has recommended (possibly sent by the restaurant itself after M handed the transaction over to the restaurant) that have been curated from Instagram. Maybe next imagine double-blinded, in-app/real-time reviews are curated for you that have been taken from global Whatsapp conversations at random. Of course, none of this has been detailed as currently possible or even something M is targeting to do but the possibility is high visibility. This is how Facebook is going to flex its total platform, in my opinion, as it matures. Facebook is slowly building out an empire that can not only be helpful to everyday life as a sum of all its parts but one that can make smart suggestions that help make life better. Getting a decision right or not having to wait on hold to set up cable is meaningful to overall happiness - not just happiness with Facebook or its platform. M being successful is a multiplier for the entire platform, and that's going to matter in a big way going forward. Now, if you don't absolutely hate the idea of M or if you don't think that this is going to be "the straw that breaks the camel's back," you have to consider what Facebook has done in regards to equity management and what that means as an investor. First, Facebook is at no shortage for news. It's seemingly constantly out with a bullish data point or a product update. This helps keep investor sentiment focused on progress and helps keep institutional investors focused on forward-looking possibilities, not the company as-is right now. As the prospects of the company continue to improve, using assumptions to be sure - assumptions of market take rate and overall success, so too does Facebook forward financial modeling. I've evidenced this before with, but it's worth reiterating. Financial estimates for Facebook's revenue, EBITDA, net income, and fully diluted EPS have all doubled since inception of estimates when viewing the full-year 2017 cohort (see graphic below). This means that in the years since full-year 2017 estimates were first made, initial estimates of forward-looking years (2017 in this instance) are often made more than two years in advance of the actual underlying year, that Facebook has literally innovated itself into double the expected financial size and financial achievement. For me at least, this means that you should buy Facebook now for innovation it will announce later. Put simply, it is my belief that revenue estimates for Q4/17 that are currently being made will need to be positively revised at some point prior to actual Q4/17 as a result of future innovation announcements made by Facebook. If this happens, Facebook shares should be allowed to move higher as a result of greater financial expectations. Ideas like M allow analyst to move forward exactly how rich Facebook's model should be ahead of it happening, like they have done since inception of 2017 estimates, which then Facebook (at least to this point) shows progress towards realizing, which then moves its share price higher and higher. I think this was the big miss the industry didn't acknowledge when shares traded in the mid-teens after the Facebook IPO. The market is now willing to buy next month's/next quarter's/next year's Zuckerberg vision ahead of it being announced or realized. I mean, just take a look at these red lines in the charts below: So for me, Facebook is and continues to be a long-term hold but a name that I think you have to buy and bet big on forward innovation. Or at least the realization and optimization of already announced innovation. I think that means you buy long-dated CALL options - to which I've been open about owning. I still hold these CALL options. I think that if you're going to hold Facebook equity right now, at today's valuation, you're really betting on the future anyways. I think you might as well get levered up because if Facebook's initiatives fail to realize what is being priced into shares currently - the market cap has a long ways to fall anyways. Regardless of if you own common or CALL options. I think you lever up the long end of the maturation curve and hope the cash flow output are as productive as they're modeled to be at that point. But I'm a risk-weighted investor and maybe you aren't. Do what's right for you. But does it? We'll have to wait and see how M develops and to what amount of focus this endeavor becomes for the company. In any case though, I believe this is another example of the forward thinking of Facebook and a reason for investors to at the very least look into if a leveraged bet makes sense.
