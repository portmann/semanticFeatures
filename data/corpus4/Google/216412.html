'Facebook At Work' Could Be A Stepping Stone Toward A Real Enterprise Software Suite - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha The free Facebook At Work enterprise app helps companies build a private social network for their employees to contact and collaborate with each other. It doesnâ€™t offer any real spreadsheet or document creation features like Office365 or Google Apps For Work do right now. I believe Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) is eager to grow its empire outside its advertising comfort zone. Going forward I see Facebook eventually offering premium enterprise productivity apps like what Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) are doing right now. It's true that its core advertising business has helped FB breach the old $85 price target I argued for last year. However, I expect the growing ad-blocking trend and stiff competition from Google will eventually slow down Facebook's advertising momentum. It's therefore welcome news that Facebook recently announced that its Facebook At Work app for the enterprise just landed a client in Royal Bank of Scotland. Facebook At Work is still a free app (and also advertising-free) that helps companies build a private social network for their employees. Royal Bank of Scotland is using this free app to build a walled-in custom social network for its 100,000 employees. I expect Facebook to eventually monetize this product in the future because Zuckerberg's original vision for Facebook was always to make profit out of the users of its software/platform. Since enterprise clients will likely stay away from using a free ad-laden software, I expect Zuckerberg to ultimately offer Facebook At Work as a subscription-only enterprise app that could include productivity features like what Office 365 and Google Apps For Work do right now. As of now, employees will be able to create a distinct account for their company's Facebook @ Work network to collaborate and communicate with other employees. Facebook at Work also will allow text chats, audio and video calls between co-workers instead of them relying on paid enterprise apps like Skype For Business. However, common sense tells me that Royal Bank of Scotland is unlikely to pay any subscription fees for Facebook At Work unless it offers productivity features. That bank is likely paying for a per-user annual license for Office 365 so that its employees can do spreadsheets, create documents and make presentation slideshows. It's my fearless forecast that Facebook At Work is just an experiment toward creating an alternative Facebook-branded Office cloud-based platform for corporations that are currently dependent on Office 365 and Google Apps For Work. It's not that hard or expensive to create a cloud-based spreadsheet or document creation app that allows workers on Facebook At Work's social network create/collaborate over office-related documents/files. I opine that programmer Zuckerberg himself could spend a week creating a mobile/web word processor if he wants to do so right now. Facebook has a compelling need to grow outside of its advertising-centric business model. It's true that Facebook gets most of its ad revenue from mobile apps. However, there will come a time when Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Google will not be able to detect and ban apps masquerading as browser-only ad-blockers. Been Choice was a best-selling iOS app that went beyond its Safari-only ad-blocking claims. Apple banned Been Choice because it also blocks ads on other mobile apps like Facebook and Apple's own News app. There will come a time that greedy third-party mobile app developers will start to sell software that will reduce the revenue stream from Facebook's app-install advertising platform. I therefore posit that the rapidly growing enterprise software as a service (SaaS) market is a fertile expansion ground for Facebook. Document creation apps like Office 365 and Google Apps are one of the growth drivers for the upcoming $106 billion/year SaaS subscription industry. Integrating a word processor and spreadsheet creator within Facebook At Work is a believable future scenario. Facebook's almost 1.5 billion active users obviously include government and private employees. They are already familiar with Facebook's web and mobile network's interface like they are familiar with Microsoft Office's desktop and web version UI. It will not be difficult for employees to shift from Office 365 to a Facebook-branded desktop or cloud-based productivity software. The economic benefits of providing a subscription-only enterprise productivity app is easy to comprehend. Google Apps For Work charges $3 per user monthly fee. Microsoft charges $5 per user as a monthly fee for its cheaper Office 365 business plan. I'm confident that Facebook could eventually really compete with Microsoft and Google by coming up with a flat $1 per user monthly licensing fee for its own future enterprise productivity suite. $1 x 100 million employees using Facebook productivity apps = $100 million per month Multiply by 12 and we get $1.2 billion/year of potential non-advertising related revenue stream. The free Facebook At Work is clearly just a stepping stone that might lead to Zuckerberg's company becoming a real player in the enterprise SaaS market.
