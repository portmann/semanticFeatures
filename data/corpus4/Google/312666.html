Why I Will Frequently Trade But Never Invest In Ford And GM - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Despite positive developments, Ford and GM are stuck in a trading range. Societal trends and industry developments are working against both companies. This article will quantify the effect of societal changes on the automotive industry. For some reason, I remember it well. My parents loaded me and my siblings in their car for a ride to town. I dutifully took my place in the back seat, between my older sister and younger brother. On the return trip, while we were at a traffic light, my father spotted a vehicle stopped in the opposite lane. "Look. That car is made in Japan. They're trying to sell them in the United States. It's called a Toyota." I leaned forward and followed the length of his arm as he pointed at the car. It was white. It was new and shiny. It was small. I was unimpressed. Those cars won't sell, I thought. I would be getting my license soon, and a car like that would not do. No girl would want to date a guy with a little Japanese car. Despite stellar results this year, Ford (NYSE: F ) and General Motors (NYSE: GM ), two iconic American car companies, seem doomed to trade in a narrow range. Why, ask shareholders, don't the stocks increase in value. It has been nearly two years since I wrote my last article on GM and Ford. "While I can understand the allure of an investment in Ford and/or GM, I will pass on both companies. I am a man of limited means, and it is my opinion better investments are available. However, GM and Ford fit my model for a very profitable trade. The stock of each company is significantly underpriced. The short-term prospects of each company are good, and Ford and GM both boast dividends north of three percent. The dividends should help prop up the companies' share price and attract dividend investors. If the market pushes the stock below my entry point, I can collect my dividends as I wait for the likely increase in the share price." How did Ford and GM stock fare since the publication of that article? 04/21/14 F opened $16.01 close 02/03/16 $11.46 04/21/14 GM opened $33.95 close 02/03/16 $28.92 As you can see, I got that one right. But a broken clock gives good time twice a day, and both Ford and GM have made great advances since that article hit Seeking Alpha. A few highlights of Ford's progress: The F-Series pickup remained the best-selling vehicle in the US for the 34th straight year. In the last two years, Ford made huge strides shoring up the company's pension obligations. Ford recorded the greatest pretax profit in its 112 year history, $10.8 billion. Ford reported a profit in Europe ($259 million) for the first time in four years. Profits in the Asia Pacific region at $765 million, are the highest ever, representing an increase of 29 percent. Ford's full-year net income jumped to $7.4 billion from $1.2 billion in 2014. And as for GM? The chart below doesn't say it all, but it does speak volumes. GM was No. 1 in sales in North America, South America, and China. So with all of the gains made by these two companies, why am I against investing in Ford and GM, particularly when 2016 is expected to be another banner year? One reason I hesitate to pull the trigger is the large levels of debt both companies hold, particularly Ford. Additionally, both companies operate in highly competitive markets. Other industries offer higher profit margins and better growth opportunities. But more importantly, as I conducted research for this article, I found ominous headwinds facing both companies in the future. Societal changes present serious problems for the automotive industry I have a side job as a strength and fitness coach for a local high school football team. It seemed curious to me that many of my athletes don't have a drivers' license and aren't terribly interested in acquiring one. I simply assumed my boys were a bit odd…until I read the following: This Is a Big Problem for the Auto Industry - and It's Getting Worse According to a study cited in the above article, only 77 percent of Americans held a drivers' license in 2014. That represents a five percent drop since 2008 and a ten percent drop since 1983. Although all age groups recorded losses in relation to license holders in 1983, among the youngest cohort the losses were continuous, without upturns in intervening years. Fewer drivers' licenses mean fewer car purchases… In a recent study , over a third of Generation Y consider modes of transportation other than personal cars as the preferred means of travel. Nearly a third listed a combination of trains, light rail, buses, carpooling, car sharing, ridesharing, bicycling, bike sharing, and walking as common means of transportation. Millennials now constitute the largest percentage of the US workforce… AlixPartners , a consulting firm, estimates there are already 500,000 fewer vehicles on the road because of car sharing. AlixPartners projects 4 million people will be sharing cars by 2020. As a consequence, there will be 1.2 million fewer cars on the road. Among those studied, 51% stated car sharing resulted in avoiding the purchase or lease of a vehicle, and 45% anticipate they will not purchase an automobile in the future Other studies buttress those of AlixPartners. A nationwide study conducted by researchers at the University of California estimated nine to thirteen vehicles were lost for every vehicle used in car sharing. Study participants owned 2,968 vehicles prior to joining a car sharing service. Once car sharing clients joined the service, ownership levels dropped to 1,507 vehicles. The consulting firm of Frost & Sullivan provides estimates of fifteen lost vehicles for every car sharing vehicle in use. Frost & Sullivan also determined car sharing members drove 31% less than when they owned a personal vehicle. Frost & Sullivan project car sharing membership will reach 4.4 million in North America and 5.5 million in Europe by 2016. Autonomous cars are coming sooner than most people think That's right, autonomous cars are arriving on US roads sooner than you might think. Don't believe me? Check out the following headlines and excerpts from recent articles. Tesla battles Google in race to get driverless cars on the road: Elon Musk says company will produce self-driving vehicles by 2016 "Germany's Daimler AG and Japan's Nissan have both said they hope to begin selling self-driving cars by the end of the decade." " When asked about whether self-driving cars would emerge by 2020, GM President Dan Ammann didn't hesitate with his answer. " Robot Taxis , a joint venture between DeNA Co and ZMP Inc, is hoping to start testing an autonomous car in Kanagawa from March that will be able to chauffeur tourists to and from the Olympic stadium in time for the opening ceremony." London's first driverless cars based on Heathrow 'pods' "The so-called UltraPods currently in service at Heathrow carry passengers between the car park and Terminal 5. In the five years they have been in use, they have carried 1.5 million passengers and traveled 1.8 million miles (three million kilometres)." "The Greenwich Automated Transport Environment project - or Gateway - will see seven driverless pods tested on the pavements around the Greenwich Peninsula, where the O2 Arena is based, from July." It is important to note that self-driving does not mean autonomous. Self-driving cars in 2020 will be able to accelerate, brake and steer a car's course without input from the driver. An autonomous car is defined as one in which the driver could be completely disengaged from a vehicle. In fact, the vehicle could move from one place to another without occupants. Don't believe that's possible? View this video to see a car that can park itself today, not in the year 2020. Look here for a video of an autonomous vehicle negotiating a variety of common traffic conditions. Here is an excerpt from an article in the MIT Technology Review, Hidden Obstacles for Google's Self-Driving Cars. "Google often leaves the impression that, as a Google executive once wrote, the cars can "drive anywhere a car can legally drive." However, that's true only if intricate preparations have been made beforehand, with the car's exact route, including driveways, extensively mapped. Data from multiple passes by a special sensor vehicle must later be pored over, meter by meter, by both computers and humans. It's vastly more effort than what's needed for Google Maps. Google's cars are better at handling some mapping omissions than others. If a new stop light appeared overnight, for example, the car wouldn't know to obey it. However the car would slow down or stop if its on-board sensors detected any traffic or obstacles in its path. Among other unsolved problems, Google has yet to drive in snow, and Urmson says safety concerns preclude testing during heavy rains. Nor has it tackled big, open parking lots or multilevel garages. The car's video cameras detect the color of a traffic light; Urmson said his team is still working to prevent them from being blinded when the sun is directly behind a light. Despite progress handling road crews, "I could construct a construction zone that could befuddle the car," Urmson says. Pedestrians are detected simply as moving, column-shaped blurs of pixels-meaning, Urmson agrees, that the car wouldn't be able to spot a police officer at the side of the road frantically waving for traffic to stop. The car's sensors can't tell if a road obstacle is a rock or a crumpled piece of paper, so the car will try to drive around either. Urmson also says the car can't detect potholes or spot an uncovered manhole if it isn't coned off." The introduction to this article was more than a pathetic attempt by this author to wax poetic. If you are my age, you can remember a time when cars were without seat belts and the only vehicles on the road were made in America. Think of what happened to Ford and GM with the introduction of Toyotas (NYSE: TM ) into the American market. Big changes, right? Now think of what autonomous cars can bring. It is my personal perspective that self-driving cars will result in not only a rapid acceptance of the concept of autonomous cars, but will accelerate demand for autonomous vehicles. Once autonomous cars are on the road, I contend that car manufacturers are doomed. Imagine a future in which a company like Uber brings a vehicle to your doorstep summoned by your smartphone. Need a quick ride to the mall? A little inexpensive two-seater will show up at your doorstep. Want to haul that old couch to the dump? A long-bed truck backs into your driveway. Wish to drive across country with the family? A plush car with plenty of windows and an interior embedded with entertainment devices is at your disposal. Under those conditions, will you really want to make payments on a personal vehicle? Need a ride to work. The car you use for your morning commute may be the same vehicle your night-shift employed neighbor uses to wheel to work. In other words, fewer cars will be needed. And the car manufacturers? They will sell the bulk of their vehicles to large companies with enormous fleets. Ever look at the margins Ford and GM get from rental companies? That's the future of the automobile industry. I'm not claiming this will happen overnight, but I'll be drawing Social Security in a few years, and the odds are that I'll live long enough to see the scenario I described. Obviously, that doesn't mean my hand is posed over my computer keyboard awaiting tomorrow's market opening to dump my shares in Ford. To the contrary. I make it a practice to monitor solid, high yield companies with range-bound shares. Ford and GM fit that description. I purchased shares of Ford recently, and I fully expect to sell them for a profit before year's end. I hope to trade in and out of Ford and GM on numerous occasions over the next decade or two. But invest long term. Sorry, no. An aside only kinda sorta related to this article I have a passion for investing, and that means I spend a great deal of time reading (and writing) investment articles. Unfortunately, the nature of investing means the pieces can sometimes be dull. Even the most avid investor may need a respite from 10-Ks and earnings transcripts. With that in mind, I leave you with ten quotes concerning cars. "The problem with the designated driver program, it's not a desirable job, but if you ever get sucked into doing it, have fun with it. At the end of the night, drop them off at the wrong house." "A light on my car's dashboard came on, and instead of fixing the problem, I waited for the bulb to burn out. Crisis solved." "Life is more than great sex and a nice car." "Men may or may not be better drivers than women, but they seem to die more often trying to prove that they are." "I said I'd drive to her place. But she lives in her car, so I don't see why she couldn't just drive her place to my place." "If all the cars in the United States were placed end to end, it would probably be Labor Day Weekend" Additional disclosure: This information is provided for guidance and information purposes only.
