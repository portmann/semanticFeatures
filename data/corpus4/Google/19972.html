Microsoft: Browser Benefits And The Age Of Windows 10 - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Don't underestimate the importance of a good web browser. Although they don't directly drive revenue, they are essential supplemental ecosystem pieces. Microsoft is making a great move ditching Internet Explorer. It should improve user experience, search engine market share, and (residually) ad revenue. A couple of days ago, an article was published talking about the most popular U.S. web browsers, as identified by the U.S. Federal Government. It was noteworthy as finally being some "clear, objective data" regarding web browsers. In doing research on this over the last four months we've come upon some different metrics to ponder, but one theme is recurring - Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) is losing web browser share to Google's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Chrome and Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Safari. Internet Explorer has been around basically since the beginning of the mainstream internet and while it has gone through many version changes and mutations, it hasn't been until just the last 5-10 years that its market share has started to noticeably slip. It comes at an interesting time for Microsoft. Under the guide of Satya Nadella, MSFT is now a company focused on its cloud offering through Azure and expanding its signature Office line to different platforms and all devices. We think it's appropriate that under Nadella, Internet Explorer finally heads toward retirement. We think this is a move that's going to continue to help Microsoft, which we believe is already moving in the right direction. We like Microsoft as a multi-year long-term hold in any dividend portfolio. Here, we'll explain why we think IE's retirement is timely, and why we like Microsoft as an investment. Why are browsers important? To investors, they may not seem meaningful at all - they're not profit drivers, they don't appears as a line item on giant companies' P/L - so, why care? They're free, and they serve just one function. Browsers actually do generate some income, actually. Browsers make their money from advertising as well as by search royalties and market penetration. Search royalties are when a search engine will pay a browser to make their engine the default. In other words, Google will pay a kickback to companies that set its search engine as their default browser. This article shows that Google kicked back $1 billion of the $1.3 billion it made from being the default search engine on Safari to Apple. Microsoft probably does this for Bing as well. Market penetration is the much bigger opportunity. By getting a branded browser into your software ecosystem, you are far more to buy/use the same companies' other software and tools when working on other projects. Namely, because they work better. For instance, those who use Chrome are more likely to search on Google and use things like Google docs. Those who use Safari, for instance, may be more likely to buy an iPhone to duplicate the same browsing experience across several devices. This can be summed up from points in this Computer World piece which stresses the importance of the ecosystem, Purchase an iPhone, for example, and you're buying into the entire Apple ecosystem, including operating systems, apps, add-ons, music, movies, books and more. The big money isn't in your single purchase, but in encouraging you to purchase only products and services that interact with each other - and your wallet. With BYOD on the rise and our personal and professional lives becoming increasingly intermixed, an individual's choice to buy into one of these ecosystems affects her business use, and vice versa. And while many of us function in two or more of these ecosystems, others increasingly depend on a single system for both personal and business needs. And supplemented by this Digital Trends article which notes the obvious - all items within one ecosystem simply work better than mixing, There are many advantages to going with a single ecosystem for your desktop PC, laptop PC, mobile phone and tablet. (Even game system and television, in some cases.) Devices within that ecosystem are designed to work well with each other. They sync easily so that preferences and media can be effortlessly copied or shared with multiple devices. Applications may be universal, meaning they require a single purchase to work on multiple devices at the same time. And the user interfaces are usually similar or identical across devices. With Microsoft's push to try and get Bing on as many systems as Google, a new browser that's desirable will help with this race. This should speak to investors. The search engine and the software pair nicely together. Using the right search engine is a direct derivative of browser market share. More people using your search engine translates directly into more ad revenue. Forbes points out that Bing is gaining ground on Google, It's already a part of our lexicon, and at that point it's hard to do anything about market dominance: when you search for something online, it's called "Googling," and as a culture, we've practically forgotten that Google isn't the only player in web search. But as we head deeper into 2015, it looks like Bing, the long-time runner-up in online search volume, might finally be catching up to the unquestioned leader. As you can see here from the above mentioned study, Chrome now leads the way in browsers. Even worse for Microsoft is that only about half of those people using IE are even using the most recent version. A new browser could help solve both of these problems. It hasn't been that long since we wrote an article about Microsoft suggesting that the company purchase Opera, and also suggesting that Internet Explorer was part of the problem, not part of the solution for the "new" Microsoft. We talked about the importance of getting their browser house back in order. This was the conclusion we drew in late 2014, If Microsoft really wanted to do something worthwhile with this relationship, they'd be letting Opera in as the new default browser for Windows based PCs and tablets, as well. The company has a chance to stop their declining market share in the browser world by putting out a much higher quality product than IE, and I think Opera would be well received. It would also allow the Nokia browsing experience to gel with that of the users home computers. Microsoft wants "one platform to rule them all?" It's going to be tough to do when the first thing consumers do after buying a Windows product is switch their browser to a Google product. Naturally we're happy to see progress on this front by the company, even though we didn't get our Opera wish. This article from The Verge details the new "Spartan" project, While Microsoft has dropped hints that the Internet Explorer brand is going away, the software maker has now confirmed that it will use a new name for its upcoming browser successor, codenamed Project Spartan. Speaking at Microsoft Convergence yesterday, Microsoft's marketing chief Chris Capossela revealed that the company is currently working on a new name and brand. "We're now researching what the new brand, or the new name, for our browser should be in Windows 10," said Capossela. "We'll continue to have Internet Explorer, but we'll also have a new browser called Project Spartan , which is codenamed Project Spartan. We have to name the thing." This is all a part of the bigger evolution picture for Microsoft. A new browser, in a new operating system, is a move in the right direction. We can't wait to see Windows 10 (mostly just to get rid of Windows 8). In an earlier piece, we wrote about why Windows 8 failed to impress consumers and how the "tile" format of the OS works best on tablets only. We critiqued that the company should focus more on a Windows 7-like environment for those using their desktops when they produce the next version of Windows, which is now considered long overdue. It's now looking like Windows 10 will combine both Windows 7 and 8 elements with a fresh new browser. Recent news regarding Windows was that Microsoft will be making Windows 10 a free upgrade. The quote from the OS Chief was "we think of Windows as a service." This decision making conveniently comes months after Apple made a similar move when it launched its Mavericks operating system to the public. If this wasn't the right thing to do in our opinion, we'd be giving Microsoft grief for yet another "copycat" move. However, we think Nadella and team have made the right decision in giving away Windows 10 and updating the browser. Loyal Windows users who have endured Windows 8 deserve it. The company stated last month that Windows 10 users will get it for free during its first year of availability, and that phone users also will be eligible for the upgrade. We think that Windows 8 (and its browser) is one of the biggest issues that Microsoft, an otherwise well run company, needs to face up to. We also think it's worth paying attention to if you're a Microsoft stockholder. While it's not likely to make a monetary impact (few things that are free do), it could make a much broader impact in how Microsoft is viewed in the technology/computing field. A successful launch of Windows 10 could do big things for those invested in Microsoft. The synergy between Windows 10 and Xbox could help create a better all around user experience for those with more than one Microsoft product in their lives. Again, we digress back to the importance of the ecosystem, of which the new browser is going to play a part. As an investment, we like MSFT for a long-term hold in a dividend portfolio. Compared to the last year, Microsoft now trades at a discount. At $40, with a yield of $1.15 annually, we'll gladly hold MSFT. How does something as simple as changing a browser relate to holding MSFT over the long-term as a dividend stock? 1. The company's new browser gets Windows users on the same page. 2. The company's new browser replaces the failed "Internet Explorer" name. 3. The company's new browser will have Bing built into it. 4. Ad revenue generated from all three of the above contribute revenue to the company's D&C Other segment. •D&C Other, comprising: Resale, including Windows Store, Xbox Live transactions, and Windows Phone Store; search advertising; display advertising; Office 365 Consumer, comprising Office 365 Home and Office 365 Personal; Studios, comprising first-party video games; Mojang; non-Microsoft products sold in our retail stores; and certain other consumer products and services not included in the categories above. D&C Other has been a segment that hasn't grown over the last year, but for a bump last quarter due to Xbox One services. 5. Residual positive affects from a better browser mean people are more likely to choose the Windows OS across platforms. 6. Ad revenue and a more sustained customer base allow for continued growth and padding of the top line via a "product refresh" that continues to now fall off with IE. 7. Once the expenses of creating a new browser are paid off, the top line (D&C Other) should see nominal growth as a result of all of these and the new browser spurring growth. 8. Refreshing the top line with "basic" operating expenses (post-beta testing, etc) should be a small part of the puzzle that helps drive profit. 9. Continued profit in this segment (assuming others also continue growth) means the company will likely continue on its streak of increasing its dividend. It's modest forward P/E of 14x, its $10.92 in cash per share, and its tidy balance sheet all make MSFT a buy and hold candidate here while they get their Windows 10 house in order. Analyst estimates put 2016 earnings at $3.15. At a fair 18x P/E ratio on this number we get $56, a share price we think we could easily see for Microsoft during 2016 if Windows 10 helps the company grow search engine, browser, and operating system market share. With a yield of 2.6% and continuing growth, we believe Microsoft is a great stock for buy-and-hold investors. If they get their new browser and Windows 10 right, it could be a move that again spurs growth for the company and pays off for years to come.
