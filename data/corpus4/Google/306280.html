The story at Applied Micro today is pretty much the same as it was a few years ago - and that's not a good thing. HP seems to have stopped playing up its Moonshot server, and investor excitement around AMCC has faded somewhat - yet the stock still trades at a robust multiple. A revenue ramp based on X-Gene 3 is promised for late calendar 2016, but previous expectations have not materialized meaningfully. While bulls will undoubtedly say that there's a massive opportunity here if X-Gene can steal even a few percent of Intel's share, that hope seems to be priced in. If the company does not demonstrate the viability of its technology via significant revenue from production silicon, shares could have much further to fall. Oh, Applied Micro (NASDAQ: AMCC ). So much potential - allegedly - yet so little execution. I've followed the company for several years now. As a former Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) shareholder, I thought it was worth monitoring the much-hyped (but yet to materialize) threat of ARM-based servers replacing x86. If you're not familiar, the argument revolved around the technical differences between "RISC" (reduced instruction-set computing) and "CISC" (complex instruction set computing). Intel's x86 architecture uses the latter, while ARM (NASDAQ: ARMH ) chips use the former. Bulls, and ARM, claim that CISC is extraordinarily inefficient and ARM chips are inherently more efficient. With server owners highly focused on total cost of ownership and perf/watt/dollar, ARM chips were supposed to be the data-center equivalent of a gas-sipping Prius replacing a hulking, belching F-350. At first the story was that ARM could take over all of the data center, then it was scaled back to microservers that could represent 10-20% of the TAM... and now it's something most companies have stopped talking about. Indeed, Applied Micro bulls (and Intel bears) pointed to Hewlett Packard Enterprise's (NYSE: HPE ) "Moonshot" server, which had a 64-bit ARM version that was supposed to be revolutionary. It was quite the engineering marvel; HP used to discuss this all the time on calls and investor presentations - but strangely, my research tool can't find a reference in their call transcripts since September 2014. Coincidentally, if you google "HP ARM," all the first page results are from September 2014. For a technology that's supposedly going to revolutionize the data center, it's a little odd that its biggest proponent has gone radio silent, isn't it? The bull case for Applied Micro has always been that even a little tiny slice of the Intel-dominated server market would be worth a whole lot… but unfortunately, despite a lot of big words, AMCC has not delivered on the execution side. Since the company hasn't received much coverage on Seeking Alpha since Ashraf Eassa's good work , I thought I'd give investors an update on the story. Summary: it's the same as it always has been and that's not a good thing. HP may have stopped talking up ARM servers, but that hasn't deterred Applied Micro from highlighting other big wins. One of the first things that Applied Micro's CEO, Dr. Paramesh Gopi, highlighted on the recent call was a seemingly benchmark validation of the technology by the European Union: I'm excited to report that as announced last Monday, X-Gene was chosen as the sole ARM server solution for the European Union Supercomputing Hyperscale 2020 Initiative. The European market is demonstrating that it wants an alternative to x86, and APM was chosen amongst all of the other ARM server providers. X-Gene is clearly the best alternative to x86 and superior to the competition in HPC and hyperscale environments with our enterprise-hardened, industry-leading products. This decisive win is testimony to our superior product and technology offering versus other ARM competitors. It sounds impressive - until you actually dig into the details. Not having heard of this initiative, I followed the paper trail and ended up reading this : Horizon 2020 is the biggest EU Research and Innovation programme ever with nearly €80 billion of funding available over 7 years (2014 to 2020) - in addition to the private investment that this money will attract. It promises more breakthroughs, discoveries and world-firsts by taking great ideas from the lab to the market. The 4.8 million EUR in funding that AMCC will achieve is six-tenths of one-hundredth of one percent of the total funding available under the Horizon 2020 program. Paging through the details of the Horizon 2020 program, it appears to be something of a government-sponsored venture capital fund, throwing bits of money at lots of different buzzwordy technologies and hoping some stick. For example, here is the table of contents for just the "Information and Communication Technologies" program under Horizon 2020. (Link here .) I think "Smart Anything Everywhere Initiative" and "gaming and gamification" tell you a lot about what sort of project Horizon 2020 is. While Applied Micro is making it sound like the EU is desperately seeking an alternative to x86, and believes X-Gene is just the thing to cure all that ails it, my take as an analyst is that someone within the EU bureaucracy decided that X-Gene was a good enough story to give them a trivial amount of money in the context of the total program. Indeed, that is, and has been, my problem with the AMCC X-Gene story. It's just that. A story. It seems somewhat facile to, on the one hand, tout that the company is receiving what amounts to venture funding from the EU - while on the other hand stating that the upcoming X-Gene 3 will be "comparable to Intel's E5 and E7" and "the highest performance per watt provided by any single-socket platform." These are direct quotes from Dr. Gopi on the conference call; he went on to say that X-Gene is seeing "excellent traction" and will deploy with "mega data center players" later this year. At some point, though, this story has to turn into commercial revenue from production silicon (not just grant funding). In July 2014, Dr. Gopi stated that X-Gene 2 had two-thirds of the performance of an Intel Xeon E5 at 40% of the total cost of ownership - seemingly a very strong value proposition; enough to land big clients. As of today, X-Gene 2 is production silicon that is shipping for revenues (per the conference call) and yet AMCC revenues have yet to show any sort of meaningful ramp. This, I should note, is in spite of the fact that the base/legacy business has now stabilized and is no longer a drag. The company has sequentially increased revenue for four quarters, as it noted on the call - but that's hardly saying much when you zoom out a bit: Indeed, while Intel's datacenter results have been well below their targeted 15% CAGR, they're still growing - for the full year 2015, Intel DCG revenue was up 11%, comprised of 8% volume and 3% price. Total DCG revenue was $16B. If X-Gene 2 was as competitive as ARM claimed, why couldn't it capture, say, merely half a percent of Intel's sales? This meager piece of business - a few pilot projects, really - would equate to $80MM of incremental revenue annually. Even Dr. Gopi admits that a little adoption would go a long way - again, here's a verbatim quote from January 2015: If you take that one [hyperscale] customer that you're talking about that does 60,000 servers a year, today those are all essentially 2P Intel type servers. The point there is that a small delta in their buying pattern would mean a very large delta in our revenue pattern. With the base business stabilized, then, you would expect X-Gene sales to really start shining through. They haven't so far. While the company is now talking about material revenue later in 2016, this isn't the first time by my count that they've promised big things. In the Q4 2014 call (in April 2014), in response to an analyst question about X-Gene revenue in 2015, Dr. Gopi discussed purchase orders in hand and concluded that: "we are on track to make sure that there is going to be a fairly important and, I will call it, notable deployment at the end customers and with the OEMs towards the second half of our fiscal year." Here we are 18 months later, with the Q3 2016 report in hand, and I don't see any revenue that I would call "notable" as an analyst. That, it seems, will have to wait until fiscal 2017 (late calendar 2016). And this isn't even the first delay from the original timeline - you can go all the way back to the Q1 2014 call in July 2013 and find this: "from the sample to first revenues, meaningful revenues, is about a year and we've always said that expect revenue in our fiscal -- calendar 2014, fiscal 2015" Will the third time be the charm? Given the track record of empty promises here, I find it hard to be optimistic. Notwithstanding AMCC's claims about superior technology, Intel is delivering strong results right now and AMCC isn't - and as I discussed here , the Altera deal only strengthens Intel's position in the datacenter. Intel is willing to throw a lot of money around, both through organic R&D and acquisition, to protect this critical piece of their business. They're not snoozing, and any share gains AMCC manages to achieve (if there are any) will likely be very hard fought. The problem with AMCC is that if you take away X-Gene and its sister products, there's really not much left. The base business has stabilized - for now - but the stock is still trading at 2.5 times trailing revenues, and they're right around their revenue break-even point (which they have lowered to the low $40 million from $50 previously). They have plenty of cash on the balance sheet, so there's no immediate concern if they continue to burn cash here - but with all that's going on in China (an important end-market for server chips), there could well be a scenario where the company's revenues don't grow or in fact pull back, prolonging and deepening the cash burn. Even with a flat revenue scenario, I would point out that the stock still prices in X-Gene optionality. As such, there's still room for more downside if the market concludes the X-Gene story is broken rather than delayed. Despite a lack of material profitability or demonstrated growth from X-Gene, the stock is still trading at a fairly robust multiple relative to its 10-year history. As such, absent execution with X-Gene 3, it could easily retrace to a valuation at or below 1.5x revenues. If material X-Gene 3 revenues don't materialize later this year - given that the product is said to be comparable to Xeon E5/E7 on performance and loads better on TCO - then what hope will be left? If you have a chip that's claimed to be just as good, much more power efficient, and it doesn't sell in any meaningful quantity, it's hard to assign much valuation to it. Obviously, if X-Gene 3 (or 4, or 5, or 17) does end up taking even a few percent of the server market at any sort of reasonable operating margins, then that would be worth a lot. And the company has other shots on goal (HeliX, X-Weave, X-Tend) that could all be big. That's the bull thesis here. But when the product keeps getting better (according to management) and yet revenues keep getting pushed out, what's the appeal of buying at a price that already bakes in some success? Management says there is "increasing momentum" but this has yet to show up in the financials in a way I'd consider meaningful. To paraphrase one of my favorite CEOs: "ideas, there are lots of great ideas in the world, but execution is what matters." That, in so many words, is the problem with Applied Micro. I will recant my words if the company can translate its claimed product superiority into meaningful revenue lift. However, in light of stiff competition from Intel and a perpetual "next-year" story told by management, the likelihood of meaningful X-Gene adoption doesn't seem to be anywhere close to high enough to justify the stock price here.
