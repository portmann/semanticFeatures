ETF Hub Aug 21 2015, 17:06 ET | About: Apple Inc. (AAPL) | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is adding to what looks to be a growing automated-car expert team, hiring away a senior engineer from Tesla , Reuters notes in combing through LinkedIn profiles. Jamie Carlson's profile shows he's left Tesla for an unnamed position in a special projects group at Apple, Reuters says, noting six others with a background in self-driving technology have recently joined Apple. Carlson is one of a number of Tesla hires (described earlier this year as a "poaching war"). This year, Apple has hired former Volkswagen engineer Megan McClain as well as Vinay Palakkode, graduate researcher at Carnegie Mellon, a hub for automated driving research. Last week, The Guardian wrote that Apple has "hundreds of engineers" quietly working on autonomous technologies in California. Other reports have Apple hiring people with related experience from several automakers, including BMW, Volkswagen, Ford, Fiat Chrysler and Mercedes-Benz, as well as from suppliers such as Robert Bosch, TRW and Delphi Automotive. Apple should just pull the trigger and buy Tesla Stick to Chevy products you may know about them, BUT buying thar dog Tesla would be a disaster.  That dog has never been in the black and maybe you should by the stock since you are one of us taxpayers that have been subsidizing Elon Musk's folly! Lol.  See above reply.   Lol denotes humor.  Funny stuff, way for tesla to get to Apple evaluation.  Ha ha Anyhow taxpayers have subsidized many auto companies more.  GM. Chrysler even ford took $5billion.  Old news Toyota took a billion loan too.  So not sure you have looked at the numbers.  Tax credits?   Every EV maker gets the credit. I'm sure there stock (like all the high-fliers) will soon fall on hard times. However, I hope they don't self destruct. What they are doing is inspiring, and it really could be a decent start to great things. It would be extremely sad if the electric car was killed again, as it's fairly viable - at least at a certain price point. The stock will go to about $80-$100 a share, market cap of about $10 billion, then maybe Apple or Google will buy Tesla. If Apple can pay $3 billion for Dr. Dre and beats, And Google can buy Nest for $3 billion, Tesla is a steal at $10 billion. I think Apple buying TSLA would be mostly likely a Phoenix event with a lot of Teslarian ash in evidence during the rebirth! they cant even sell a watch, or come up with a tv, or sell ipads. let alone a car. the only thing this company has is a marketing team that sells phones. Thehash,   There is zero chance Apple is going to come out with a car.   AAPL has struggled on execution for relatively simple devices and services. The day Apple launches an autonomous car is the day I sell all my shares. There is literally no synergy with their existing product lines, tons of liability to the brand, and very poor margin potential. However, I suspect that they are not interested in building cars as much as they are interested in controlling the increasingly important infotainment system of the car, which further strengthens their product ecosystem and provides additional revenue streams (both from the automaker and then the end user). Who knows if these secretive efforts will ever come to fruition? There are dozens of nameless projects being pursued at Apple that will never see the light of day. "There is literally no synergy with their existing product lines, tons of liability to the brand, and very poor margin potential." There is literally no truth to this assertion. An autonomous car with Internet access is an ideal place to work and play with Apple products, has tons of halo value for the brand, and has very high margin potential for the company that gets it right. Lots of people would like a chauffeur that never gets tired. "they are interested in controlling the increasingly important infotainment system of the car" I agree with your middle paragraph. However, Apple has always tried to have a part of their product line cater to the luxury crowds with their high margins. It wouldn't surprise me to see Apple team up with BMW to create a luxury car for the iWatch demographic. A small line, expensive, sells out in every iteration. That kind of thing. I commute 3 hours a day in a car. If my car can drive me around, I'd probably be watching tv, movies, listening to music, putting together documents or presentations. I wonder if there's a company that would allow me to do all these things using one operating system. Kush,   I think Google will give you your wish within 10 years.   But would not count on AAPL.   Just does not fit with AAPL, IMHO. Whoops forgot to quality, I would want a quality self driving car. Not a cheap Chinese car with android thrown in. So Google would not be likely. Glen, with the Google car one might be kidnapped by hackers and taken to the cleaners. Not everybody's dream but hey, for the budget adventurous consumers, it is quite a match. Glen Rivard - it won't take 10 years, and there will most probably be more than one company offering their complete solution before 2020. Regarding autonomous driving, this short video (5 minutes) --> http://bit.ly/1UYKFvh , sums up where things currently stand - although it doesn't clearly show just how far ahead of the pack Google really is. To see how far ahead Google is, take a look at this 1Â½ minute video, which is now more than a year old, and still more impressive than what current car manufacturers are showing off or... have someone start a company like UBER without the car part. the person drives your car for $20/hr. you pay $60/day or $1.2K p.m. for 20 working days or $14K an year. Not bad when compared to buying a $100K car  with an apple logo that would look like a fruit cake on a car or... help selling a lot of Teslas so Elon, the snake oil salesman can move on to the "tube" and you will get what you want TSLA .....advise lowering buy stop on 8X short position taken at 258 be lowerred to 237.10.... Also stay with 8/28 255?235 put position bought at $2.33.. We are still the most profitable advisor on SE...up 1,800 % I travel a lot, and often drive rentals - it's not uncommon to receive a completely new car - yet, I still feel relived when I get in and find something as simple as an USB-port! Same goes for Google. I don't think that their goal is to build/sell cars. Rather license the tech/software 6-7 years ago, I would never have guessed the car industry to be disrupted by companies like Google and Apple... but today I think TSLA, GOOGL and AAPL are absolutely perfect for the job, and the future of transportation can't arrive fast enough... but I don't expect Google or Apple to start building their own "Giga-Factories" - it will be through a form of collaborations with other companies In Manhattan in the 1920's, a police officer stationed in a tower manually changed the traffic signal from green to red at busy intersections based on his observations.  If he saw a particularly important person on his way to work, he might allow the light to stay green a little longer. We forget that when cars were new it took a while to understand how to use them, how to control them, and how to drive them. We can't help but be short sighted when we think about what it means to have a "self-driving car".  But almost all our assumptions will be wrong.  There will be this period where they share the road with normal cars, like motor cars shared the road with horse drawn buggies and wagons in the teens and 20's (and into the 30's in some parts of the country).  But eventually we will realize the full benefit of having autonomously mobile vehicles moving around. Cargo will transport itself.  Parents will not have to "drop the kids off at soccer practice".  Bus routes will comport to realtime demand.  The buses themselves will be electric and unmanned (overseen by a supervisor at the depot).  This will reduce cost and usher in an era of practical and convenient mass transit.  Autonomous cabs will automatically pick up business travelers and take them to their meetings because our watches coordinate with the cabs where we are and where we want to be. When we hear "self-driving car" we look at the family car and imagine riding around without having to grab the wheel.  But it will be so much more than that. What Apple brings to the self-driving car project is the understanding that you have to tear down the notion of a "car" and start over.  Each element has to exist for a reason, not because of some legacy design. "What Apple brings to the self-driving car project is the understanding that you have to tear down the notion of a "car" and start over." Tesla brings that too. "Reason from first principles" is a stated principle of their corporate culture, and comes from Elon Musk. Can you really think of a car with an Apple Logo on the Front?! But with Beats they kept the Name. They could come Up with Cars with a decent margin, but it would somehow still be a political statement: to push the Electric car movement/ the Environmental cause, which can only be Environmentally friendly when electricity is Not coming from burning coal anymore. I doubt an Apple car. Not ever happening in our lives.  Insurance companies will never allow it due to liability.   It's just a way for Google and Apple to grab headlines and try to drive stock price.  If you believe it's a good bet, then I have a Pinto you can have. People dont have any idea whats cool or innovative until someone comes and slaps the world in the face with it.  As far as the car... AAPL has a giant cash horde and has to stay on the cutting edge of innovation.  The company knows how to make money.  Anymore if someone comes out with something and the success isn't instantaneous the product is deemed a failure... but nothing ventured nothing gained.  I dont think we're too far off from vehicles with an 'autonomous' or self driving option.  Have too much at the pub... hit 'home' and avoid the ticket/jail.
