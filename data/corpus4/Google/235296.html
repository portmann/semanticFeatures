Fri, 11/13/2015 - 11:26 | 6786714 BullyBearish Twitter will NEVER turn a profit, and will NEVER have positive cash flow.  EVER! Twitter is a cash furnace.  The only questions are (1) how fash the cash burns and (2) how fast the stock goes to zero. The next candidate on deck will be Facebook. I've never seen a Facebook user pay attention to an ad.  When advertisers figure out that Facebook advertising is a total waste of money, we will see Facebook stock go KABOOM as well.

When the reality of the 'Twitter' economy begins to waft over the Bay Area (finance departments, that is)...   Let's just say that highway 101 traffic between S.F. and San Jose will experience a well deserved 'rest'...

It was a 22 minute drive when I moved there. Now over an hour.

In Dot.com 2.0 secretly stealing information about people, analyzing it and selling it to the US goverment and the powers behind the US government is more important than profits. I guess Twatter's info is just too out in the open. There is no reason for secret voyeurism. Everyone can see everyone else's twat.

The last time I told that one it took me 15 minutes to explain that the Chinese immigrants at  one  time had cornered the laundry business in California.  "No tickee no laundry." was a catch phrase even into the 1960's.

Why is the revenue not much higher, given their popularity?  Somehow they are failing to Googlize (monetize) all that "free" traffic. Just how Google *does* do it remains a modern mystery, that I have never seen well-analyzed.  It's like the Egyptian pyramids.  I guess Google is used to store grain, that's their secret, according to Ben Carson.
