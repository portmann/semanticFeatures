Free Trade Is Plutocratic Propaganda  | Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! With the looming Trans-Pacific Partnership dominating the headlines,  now is a good time to revisit an old scam called "free trade." In 2003, Kevin Flanagan was an information technology employee at Bank of America. They told  him he was being replaced with foreign labor, and he was ordered to  train his replacement. After he completed his assignment, he was laid  off. Then he went to the parking lot and shot himself. Like The Ministry of Truth in George Orwell's 1984 ,  sometimes, the most effective way to lie is to use the most innocent  words. No word is more susceptible to propaganda-leveraging than  "freedom." Attach that word to any concept, and all of a sudden, it's  unassailable. That's exactly what happened with "free trade." Proponents of free trade will often use the simplest analogies to  convey their point, as if you were retarded. The reason they have to  resort to such caveman illustrations is because free trade does not  exist in the real world. There is no such thing as equality of bargaining power .  If someone has ten million dollars and you have zero dollars, anything  above zero is an "improvement" in your situation. The free trade  economists will say this person with zero dollars is "free" to work for  $1 per hour, and they will do so because it improves their situation.  This is what "freedom" means to free trade economists. If you doubt the free trade economists, they will call you a " protectionist ," as if protecting your country's economy were some kind of grievous transgression. In fact, nothing is more American than shunning free trade nonsense. Ian Fletcher calls free trade the myth of " cowboy capitalism ." According to Fletcher, all four presidents on Mt. Rushmore were protectionists.  The entire American Revolution was fought because the colonists were  tired of being economically exploited by the British. Alexander Hamilton  realized that British dominance in manufacturing and American reliance  on agriculture were dooming us to a banana republic future. The  solution? Tariffs. By taxing British goods, the United States boosted  its manufacturing industry. By 1820, tariffs were at 40%. One of the fascinating parts of this history is that the South was  opposed to protectionism. They wanted free trade. Why? Because free trade was necessary for the international slave trade from Africa to the United States. Fast forward to 1994. That's when the North American Free Trade Agreement was enacted. The result was nothing less than the wholesale destruction of the American manufacturing industry. And where did these displaced workers go? In the 1990s, 98% of all net new jobs created were in the service industry, which has lower wages. This is what free trade looks like. I love the smell of freedom in the morning. One doesn't have to look hard to find free trade evangelists in the corporate world. Apple,  the world's largest company, is also the largest example of how free  trade is a game of heads I win, tails you lose. Only 5.6% of Apple  workers are in the United States. There are 43,000 Apple employees  in the country and 20,000 employees overseas. However, Apple is nothing  without its global suppliers, where 700,000 workers make the next round  of flashy gizmos that nobody needs anyway. These suppliers should be  included in the worker count because they are directly involved in the  manufacturing process. In February 2011, President Obama asked Steve Jobs, "Why can't that work come home?" Despite having the  last name of "Jobs," Steve Jobs made it clear that he didn't care about  jobs. He only cared about money. He said, "Those jobs aren't coming back." In 1983, Jobs used patriotism when it was convenient for him. He called the Macintosh, " a machine that is made in America ." Later, he said, " I'm as proud of the factory as I am of the computer ." But by 2004, patriotism gave way to profits, and Apple became an American company in name only. It relied on foreign manufacturing. Betsey Stevenson ,  former chief economist at the Labor Department, said, "Companies once  felt an obligation to support American workers, even when it wasn't the  best financial choice. That's disappeared. Profits and efficiency have  trumped generosity." Of course, Apple falls back on the timeless corporate lie that American workers are not skilled enough. One anonymous Apple executive said, "We shouldn't be criticized for using Chinese workers. The U.S.  has stopped producing people with the skills we need." They were skilled  enough before NAFTA, but after NAFTA, all of a sudden, they all forgot  how to do their jobs. It's funny how that amnesia works. Now, for every two American college graduates with degrees in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics, only one of them  is hired into a job in their field. Sounds like a real skills shortage. Alan Blinder ,  a professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton and a former  vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said, "Contrary to  conventional wisdom, the more offshorable occupations are not low-end  jobs, whether measured by wages or by education. The correlation between skill and offshorability is almost zero." The anonymous Apple executive made it clear that Apple was really a country to itself and did not care about jobs or social effects, "We sell iPhones in over a hundred countries. We don't have an obligation to solve America's problems." Manufacturing analysts estimate that if Apple paid Americans to build iPhones, it would cost an extra  $65 per iPhone. With hundreds of dollars of profits per phone, Apple  would still be profitable. While Obama asked Steve Jobs about bringing jobs back to America, the  Apple executives had their own suggestions. They wanted more visas so  they could bring in more foreign workers. They wanted a tax holiday so  they could bring back some of their overseas profits at no cost. They  wanted government funding to train American workers. Notice a pattern  here? They want to exploit government assistance so they can maximize their profits, which would boost their stock options. On and on it goes. You may be familiar with the term " corporate raider " from the 1980s, but what is happening now is on a scale much larger than that. It is "country raiding." Entire countries are being exploited and saddled with the burden of  supporting multi-national behemoths who tell you that your very demise  is actually your greatest freedom. Some Americans are catching on to  this scam and are actually leaving the country in pursuit of  opportunity. Imagine that: leaving America for economic reasons. Ellis  Island has been flipped on its head. "Give me your tired and your poor" has been replaced with "Let's GTFO!" As Zero Hedge reported, in the first quarter of 2015, a record number of Americans renounced their citizenship. One expatriate, Emily Matchar ,  described her experience, "After applying for 279 jobs over two years,  my husband finally got the offer he'd been hoping for: a well-paid  position teaching philosophy at a respected university. We should have  been thrilled. There was just one little thing. The job was in Hong  Kong. My husband said, "I feel like we're being deported from our own country." Meanwhile, in China, Apple continues to thrive on its masses of slave labor. Like the antebellum South, Apple supports free trade because it makes their slave labor possible.  Foxconn, Apple's major supplier, is located in Shenzhen. Do you know  how they keep their unemployment rate down? If you are a migrant worker  who has been unemployed for more than 3 months, it is illegal to rent housing .  So you can either be homeless or leave. I'm sure the people at the  Bureau of Labor Statistics would love a policy like this in the United  States. Then they wouldn't have to bend over backwards to goal-seek all  their employment data to conform to the official "recovery" story line. If you're not unemployed in Shenzhen, you're probably getting beaten by Foxconn security or jumping off buildings to escape your miserable existence. So you can imagine my level of trust when President Obama says this time  will be different. He called the Trans-Pacific Partnership " the most progressive trade deal in history ." And yet he doesn't want to tell us anything about it. With NAFTA, 5 million American manufacturing jobs were lost, and 57,000 factories shut down.  What will the Trans-Pacific Partnership do? It's like a sequel to a  movie that was terrible in the first place. Obama visited Nike's headquarters as part of his political rally. One of the high-quality jobs at Nike is held by a 32-year-old mother in Indonesia who processes 100  shoes per hour for 83 cents. I'm sure she is a free trade supporter. After awhile, you start to realize that the people who love free trade so much are economic hacks and the uber-rich.  They use sterilized language and hollow arguments to convince you of  the positive ideals of free trade. In all honesty, it's a great theory.  It really is. But then the moment you start believing it, they start  working in all sorts of exceptions - usually for themselves. Before you  know it, you're an unemployed American or a Chinese slave at Foxconn.  And the uber-rich are in the Bahamas laughing about it, thanking the  economists for playing along with the story.

Little wonder the details are top secret, even from members of congress who are supposed to vote on it.  Hint: The state is your abuser, not your savior, and arguing (endlessly) over how it should use violence for the good is ridiculous. Sun, 05/10/2015 - 12:48 | 6078214 remain calm If obama wants it, then it ain't good for you. If obama doesn't want it then it's good for you. He is a fucking liar. Sun, 05/10/2015 - 12:56 | 6078239 TeamDepends It is now obvious that TPP will work in conjunction with Jade Helm to attempt the final takedown of America. Hope and change. Sun, 05/10/2015 - 12:52 | 6078219 Oh regional Indian They, as in they, never give names casually, announce dates casually or any such thing. This is a highly choreographed drama with every set piece named and identified. So yes, it is free trade, but to whom? Trade is free when you do not have to recognize borders and/or tarrifs. Ergo, supranational entities. United Nations, IMF, World Bank. (edit, to add to this list City of London, Vatican, DC and Switzerland and thus the BIS.)

Daddy Bush on the other hand was actually part of the oligarchy. Sun, 05/10/2015 - 12:46 | 6078206 junction It is not just the USA workers who were hurt by NAFTA.  Three million farm laborers in Mexico lost their jobs 20 years ago thanks to Mexican companies importing cheaper subsidized American corn.  Carlos Slim, now one of the world's richest men, made his fortune from buying most of the Mexican government telephone monopoly on credit and then charging high call rates to the Mexican expatriates in the USA, forced to leave a Mexico wrecked by President Carlos Salinas and his drug peddling associates.  Obama is just a darker version of Salinas, whose brother arranged the killing of their main political opponent (a crime which Mexico is delaying the prosecution of, especially with PRI now in charge).  Obama also has a secret "kill list" to bump off his enemies, from Michael Hastings to talkative Navy SEALs to even Joan Rivers (you don't believe that story about her botched medical procedure, do you, right after Joan made fun of Michelle, calling her a "tranny"). Sun, 05/10/2015 - 12:46 | 6078207 GRDguy From NYtimes today: "President Obama is aggressively courting Republicans and Democrats to grant him accelerated power . . ."  That's the way it is with sociopaths; there's never enough power to get more OPM (Other People's Money).  But they fly so high on it.  And the masses keep giving it to them.

Sun, 05/10/2015 - 13:02 | 6078251 Conax They have always worked, played by the rules and have acquitted themselves admirably all their lives. Killing themselves is one thing, doing murder over anger is another. They just feel hopeless, without a future.  Killing the old boss won't fix the situation, it would only bring condemnation and shame on the family name.  In anguish, they off themselves.

Free Trade, NAFTA, Right to work, Affordable Healthcare Act, If you don't know the link you need to go back to skool. always, ALWAYS name the bill something warm and fuzzy then your political cronies write the guts of it.  Been going on a long long time.

Congrats on taking the job in the exact moment that your 99 weeks ran out. Sun, 05/10/2015 - 12:31 | 6078178 GRDguy "Free trade" is as stupid as a phrase as "free for all."   It just means the biggest can trample others freely. I'd much rather see "fair trade" and "fair markets."  Of course, they'd lie about that, too. To manage the resulting price inflation they must control exchange rates. Part of controlling exchange rates is having production move off shore. Then they must control wage increases, and so layoffs, and/or imported replacements. The FedRes, and their criminal and treasonous violence-puppets need to go, and go hard. Want to see "free trade" grind to a screeching halt?  Outsource lawyers.  Let any lawyer on planet earth operate inside USA (from a remote location).

Its reminds us too much of TBTF and crony capitalism gone global. 2Â°  We don't like state programs that could define rules which enact legislation to breakdown the Oligarchies THAT HAVE GROWN IN THE USA SINCE REAGANOMICS WAS EXPORTeD WORLD WIDE AND OUTSOURCING BECAME RELIGION. Why? COs its STATISM, aka Communism. FDR prime example from past!  So...we are stymied between the devil and the deep blue, and libertarians just can't dig their heads out of u know where!  The west is now going oriental, can't decide what decision making in a responsible way means !  Maybe the East will go rational and show us the way of how to be balanced and pragmatic without going ape shit paranoid!  Sun, 05/10/2015 - 12:41 | 6078199 isolato There are other factors at work as well. Allowing China into the WTO without any protection against their manipulation of the exchange rate has been catastrophic. Given the imbalance in trade the yuan should have appreciated substantially but American companies were profiting so handsomely that any attempt tro raise this issue has been quashed...every year. That's "free trade". isolato  There are other factors at work as well.
