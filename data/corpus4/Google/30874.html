Yahoo Needs To Cut Into Facebook's Mobile Lead - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha Yahoo is challenging Facebook with a mobile messaging app. The business is considered worthless, the value being in the Alibaba spin-off. If you bought Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) at its IPO but bought an equal amount of Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) stock, you would be much happier with Yahoo today, up 201% against Facebook's 116%. Of course, you say, that's all due to Yahoo's stake in Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ), which is in the process of going away, getting spent and spun-off. Facebook has to be the play going forward. Maybe. Facebook's success is really down to one word, mobile. It has become to mobile monetization what Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) is to the desktop, and it has grown substantially on that, earning a premium multiple. That premium multiple is key here. You're going to pay 77 times earnings for Facebook today. The ratio for Yahoo is about 6. In other words, Yahoo doesn't have to deliver great earnings on its own to justify your investment. It just has to be something other than worthless. And the way it's going to do that is by targeting Facebook's mobile lead. Its first serious effort in that direction, a messaging app to compete with Whatsapp, is now in the works. It's expected to be an integrated system, combining aspects of Skype, Meerkat and Snapchat, but without the friends-and-membership baggage of Facebook. Think less 20-something, more 40-something. (CEO Marissa Mayer turns 40 at the end of next month.) Yahoo is preparing for the launch by getting its other mobile apps in shape, like Tumblr , which will now let you make video posts with a URL through your iPhone. There is immense skepticism that Mayer can ever make Yahoo "relevant" at this point, and she's constantly being encouraged to buy companies that are, such as Foursquare . Yahoo still has billions in cash, and the Alibaba money remains on the books for now - spend it and get relevant, the smart money says. The problem is that, once Yahoo buys something, they become part of Yahoo and everyone knows Yahoo can't be "relevant." This tells me a name change and a move may both be in order. Stop calling it Yahoo. Come out with an entirely new branding identity, built around mobile services and mobile, business lifestyles. And move the company's base to New York, where Yahoo has already built extensive offices. At least get that going for you. Yahoo has been basically a media company for years. But there I go again, doing the same thing all the other analysts do, telling Mayer what to do rather than evaluating, in a straightforward way, what she has done. And what she's done, since becoming CEO in July 2012, has been to shrink the company to build something sustainable. For its last quarter the company earned $166 million, 17 cents per share, on revenues of $1.253 billion. Do that over four quarters, earn just 72 cents on $5 billion, apply a common tech multiple of five times sales, and you're got a $25 billion business, plus that value of the Alibaba spin-off, about $40 billion. I'd say that makes Yahoo dirt cheap. If it can become the anti-Facebook, if it can create a new identity for itself for the 21st century, Yahoo shares can start flying. The key word there, unfortunately, is if. Source: Yahoo Needs To Cut Into Facebook's Mobile Lead Disclosure: The author is long GOOGL.
