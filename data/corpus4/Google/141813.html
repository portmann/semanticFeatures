Why I've Had A Change Of Heart About Fitbit After Its Second Quarter - Fitbit, Inc. (NYSE:FIT) | Seeking Alpha I have been extremely critical of FIT in recent months and its longevity prospects. Fitbit (NYSE: FIT ) shares are currently 15% lower in intraday trading after it reported second quarter earnings. As a vocal bear to Fitbit's operating strategy, one might think that I would feel some sense of satisfaction about the stock response, or that it validates my outlook on Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and other smart wearable makers penetrating the basic wearables market and stopping Fitibit in its tracks. However, a bad stock reaction doesn't necessarily reflect a bad quarter, and in this case, I think I've had a change of heart. Regardless of how Fitbit is trading after earnings, whether it is up or down 15%, its quarter was exceptional by all standards. The company's revenue soared more than 250%, and on $400 million in revenue Fitbit earned non-GAAP net income of $51.3 million. For a company growing this fast, such a margin is very impressive. Typically, for a company like Fitbit I would say that the past is irrelevant. I would say that who cares if it grew 250% because with a valuation of $10 billion that growth must remain aggressive long term. But in this case, however, what's really impressive about this quarter, aside from beating revenue expectations by over $80 million, is that Fitbit did so during the Apple Watch rollout quarter, a product that could have very well eaten into Fitbit's product sales. Instead, unit sales totaled 4.5 million, up from 3.9 million in the first quarter and 1.7 million a year ago. Meanwhile, the Apple Watch's fire has by all accounts begun to flame out. The data intelligence company Slice figures that Apple is selling about 20,000 watches per day, down from the 200,000 per day it sold during its April 10 launch. Despite the Apple Watch's launch, Fitbit didn't miss a beat, and given this fact, I think it's time to start thinking that there's a big place for Fitbit in the wearables space. Not to mention, Google announced Android Wear more than a year ago, and it has consistently weathered the storm of developers like Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) launching their own smart wearables. With all things considered, if the second quarter wasn't good enough, Fitbit expects the good times to keep on rolling. The company has guided for revenue at a midpoint of $350 million for the coming quarter. That's nearly $90 million better than the consensus. And, Fitbit has issued full-year revenue guidance of $1.65 billion, growth of 120% vs. 2014, and about $250 million better than analysts expected. As a result, there's no debating that Fitbit is not missing a beat and that Apple is apparently no concern to management. The bigger question now is whether Fitbit is a good investment with its stock falling 15% and it now having a market capitalization of about $10.5 billion. Of course, I will apply this to my model to determine an accurate answer to that question. But at first glance, based on its EPS midpoint guidance of $0.73, Fitbit trades at about 60x this year's expected earnings. While expensive, I don't think it is unreasonable for a company growing this fast. In other words, I have had a complete change of heart and think that Fitbit might just be a good long-term investment with multiple expansion opportunity following its post-earnings stock weakness.
