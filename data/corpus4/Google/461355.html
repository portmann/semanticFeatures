Apple suggests new approach to songwriting royalties - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Jul 18 2016, 11:54 ET | About: Apple Inc. (AAPL) | By: Eric McCaffrey , SA News Editor Apple ( AAPL +1.3%), in a filing made with the Copyright Royalty Board , has proposed a retooling and simplification of songwriting royalty rates within a streaming environment. The rates Apple recommends, however, would not apply to Apple Music, marking this memo an acute warning shot at its competitors, most namely Spotify ( MUSIC ). Apple ideates a 9.1 cent per 100 song plays model, a stark departure from the existing complex federal rules regulating streaming music that have allowed Spotify and others to offer free subscription tiers. Apple Music strictly offers a paid model service and has direct deals with many artists present on its platform. Google, Spotify, Pandora, Amazon and the Recording Industry Association of America were also expected to file similar briefs but none have yet become available. This note comes as part of a process set up by the Copyright Royalty Board to determine download and streaming rates for the 2018-2022 period.
