Apple: The Shift To Asset-Light, High-Margin, Middlemen Businesses - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Jul. 31, 2015  4:19 PM ET  |  About: Apple Inc. (AAPL) , Includes: GOOG , GOOGL , MSFT , NOK , SNE , SSNLF by: Lester Goh Consumer electronics is a tough industry characterized by rapid change. For most companies, product concentration would be a huge negative. Risk stemming from Apple's concentration on its iPhone franchise is largely mitigated by the ecosystem the smartphone giant has managed to build around its product offerings. The firm enjoys durable competitive advantages stemming from scale, intangible assets and customer switching costs. Apple is beginning to shift to asset-light, high-margin, middlemen businesses such as the App Store, Apple Pay, iTunes and Apple Music. Not only do these businesses improve cash flow visibility due to their highly recurring nature, they serve to further strengthen Apple's moat. Consumer electronics is a tough industry - no doubt about it. The industry is characterized by rapid changes, courtesy of technology advancements. What's new today might be obsolete within months. Consumers also tend to be fickle, hopping on and off fads with little regret. This is especially so for the mobile phone industry. Fundamentally, the device itself is unable to command a meaningful degree of customer switching costs. Switching to another phone is rather easy - one can simply go out and buy one. It is hard to succeed in this industry if the phone is all your company has to offer. Product concentration would spell the death knell for the firm as soon as consumers decide that its mobile phone is no longer "cool." Take Motorola for example. The company's Razr series of phones was able to appeal to consumers during the mid-2000s. The V3 was one of very first phones that adopted a thin profile. It was so appealing to consumers that the V3 became extremely successful, selling 50m units within two years of its introduction, and 130m units within four. Motorola tried to capitalize on its virgin success in the mobile phone industry by introducing newer models of the Razr, with limited success. The company soon faded into obscurity as consumers decided that the phone was not the next big thing anymore. Nokia (NYSE: NOK ) suffered a similar fate in the late-2000s. Risk stemming from Apple's concentration in its iPhone franchise is largely mitigated by the ecosystem the smartphone giant has managed to build around its product offerings It is precisely due to non-existent switching costs that investors are skeptical of the sustainability of success at major smartphone companies such as Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). It is no secret that Apple's near-term success is highly dependent on its iPhone franchise. The franchise has consistently comprised of 60%-70%-plus of revenues in recent years and thus it is fair to say that the tech mammoth has serious product concentration. However, I believe that risks stemming from Apple's concentration in its iPhone franchise is largely mitigated by the fact that the company has managed to build an ecosystem around the iPhone. Consumers who purchase the iPhone tend to purchase other Apple products such as the iPad, the MacBook and more recently the Watch. Data is synced across each of these devices through iCloud. Further, iOS users that purchase media on iTunes are only able to transfer this media over Apple devices - they are not portable to other operating systems such as Android (with the exception of music). As a result, consumers who own a number of Apple's hardware can switch between devices to suit their needs. For example, if I merely need to get up to speed regarding my emails, I can access them on my Watch. If I need to reply to an email, I can switch to my iPhone, which is easier to type on. If I need to make minor edits to a business proposal, I can hop on my iPad. If I am engaging in workloads that require greater processing power, I can switch to my Mac. For all my computing needs, an Apple device is there to fulfill that need. The Mac, Watch and iPad have become accessories to the iPhone. Apple also has implicitly enticed its user base to adopt more and more of the company's hardware offerings. Nearly every single Apple software update mentions how a certain feature cannot only be used on the iPhone, but also the Mac and iPad. This, I'm sure, is no secret to anyone who owns an iPhone. Moreover, hardware is just half the story. The App Store has served (and continues to serve) to further strengthen the ecosystem that Apple has built by providing consumers with apps created by developers. These apps drastically increase the overall user experience and serve to further heighten the switching costs created by the company's suite of hardware offerings. It is due to this ecosystem of offerings that allow the smartphone giant to mitigate risks stemming from product concentration. Apple has succeeded where its predecessors and competitors failed. Motorola and Nokia's value propositions revolved around their phones - nothing more. These companies focused on selling more phones, capitalizing on their initial success. Instead, they should have diverted some attention to maintaining their user base. Once consumers decided to move on to another fad, these companies were finished. On the other hand, Apple has been able to build up a loyal iOS user base largely due to its ecosystem. This degree of customer lock-in helps insulate the company from changing consumer preferences and technology advancements. The firm enjoys durable competitive advantages stemming from scale, intangible assets and customer switching costs The curious reader would have realized by now that an ecosystem like the one Apple has is very valuable. Thus, the next concern one would have is likely to be - can competitors replicate the Apple model? While possible, it is extremely difficult. This is because Apple enjoys durable competitive advantages stemming from scale, intangible assets and customer switching costs, which forms formidable barriers to entry to a potential competitor. Developing an ecosystem like the one Apple has does not come cheap. Not only does a new entrant need to spend billions in R&D (Apple's R&D expense is ~$7b annually and continues to grow) replicating the company's offerings, it also would need to spend a similar amount (SG&A expense is ~$12b annually, marketing is likely the bulk of that figure) on marketing and advertising its products to consumers. If the newcomer develops a product that does not appeal to the majority of consumers, it will not sell well. Production will be a few million units and the challenger would have to eat R&D and marketing costs and will not achieve scale on manufacturing. Making unsuccessful smartphones is a good way to lose a lot of money - billions in some cases. One only needs to look at Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) foray into the industry as an example. The Redmond company was late to the party and tried to wow the market with Windows smartphones. Alas, the phone did not appeal to consumers, and the software giant only managed to sell several million units a year. Unfazed, it proceeded to acquire Nokia's handset business . Initially, I had high hopes for this acquisition (see here , and here ), but it appears that I had totally misjudged the barriers to entry in the smartphone industry. I stand corrected. Anyway, the acquisition turned out to be a disaster and Microsoft had to write down the $9 billion acquisition a few short years later. Considering that even Microsoft was unable to gain a meaningful foothold in the market, it is not a stretch to say that Apple's position is unlikely to be uprooted any time soon - the company is here to stay. Other competitors such as Samsung (OTC: SSNLF ), Xiaomi and Huawei which sell Android smartphones are unprofitable despite commanding the largest market share collectively - it's unlikely that they would continue to torch money for very long. Apart from scale, intangible assets also contribute to Apple's competitive advantage. Most notably, Apple's brand name is extremely valuable. In order for the reader to understand why I think Apple's brand is very valuable, especially in the consumer electronics industry, I believe that an explanation on brand value is required. Brands are only valuable to companies if they do one of two things (or both, but those cases tend to be very rare): Having a well-known brand is not good enough. Think about it. Everyone knows Sony (NYSE: SNE ). However, would you pay 20% more for a Sony DVD player? A brand may be well-known, but being famous is useless to the company if its consumers are unwilling to pay a premium for its products. Apple has consistently been able to raise ASPs of its iPhones even in the face of currency headwinds. The company has tried to offset currency translation by increasing the price of its products, and it has largely worked out. To the best of my knowledge, the iPhone continues to sell very well (per recent quarter commentary ) even with price hikes, illustrating that Apple is able to retain its customer base despite higher ASPs. I do not believe that Apple's brand reduces search costs significantly and hence I will not elaborate further on the topic. As for customer switching costs, I have already explained in a prior section how the company's ecosystem ensures a high degree of customer lock-in - I believe that point requires no further explanation. Thus, I will focus on the durability of that customer stickiness. An argument that bears like to raise against Apple is that Android's user base is twice that of Apple's. Android's user base is ~1b while Apple's user base is ~500m . However, iOS users spend 4x that of Google Play (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) users. Hence, to a developer looking to choose which platform to build his apps on, iOS is a no-brainer - it is where the money is. It is not a stretch to assert that the App Store is a major reason why consumers turn to the iPhone (it sure was true in my case). Therefore, as iOS users spend way more than their Android counterparts, developers are likely to migrate to iOS (if they haven't already) and develop their apps, further strengthening the Apple ecosystem and increasing customer stickiness. Furthermore, Apple has always targeted the affluent market and this is unlikely to change (the company has not ventured into the low-end for many years). Thus, this leads to a virtuous cycle - developers migrate to iOS to create apps for affluent users who pay for them, further incentivizing developers to create more apps, augmenting customer lock-in. Apple is beginning to shift to asset-light, high-margin, middlemen businesses such as the App Store, Apple Pay, iTunes and Apple Music We have established a couple of things: Apple has managed to build an ecosystem around its product offerings and maintain a sizable user base. And the financial benefits stemming from the above is likely to accrue for the foreseeable future thanks to the smartphone giant's durable competitive advantages. At this point, the reader should have no doubt that one of the major reasons for Apple's success is its ability to keep its customers within the Apple ecosystem. It follows that anything that the company does to ensure that its customers remain in its ecosystem is likely to be hugely beneficial. Apple is beginning to shift resources to ancillary businesses - such as the App Store, Apple Pay, iTunes and Apple Music. These businesses are all integrated into the ecosystem, and therefore increased use of these products by consumers will be instrumental to the company's future success. Not only do these businesses strengthen the company's ecosystem, I believe that they also will play a huge role in the company's profitability in years to come. This is because these businesses are middlemen businesses - which are characterized by asset-light operating models and high margins (at scale). It is in these businesses that Apple does not produce hardware. As a result, it follows that margins on these offerings are likely to be far greater than that of the hardware segments. Although revenues from these segments are minimal (they comprised of <10% of sales per 2014 data), their contribution to profit is likely to be outsized due to their favorable economics compared to that of the hardware business. In the App Store, Apple does not make apps - the developers do. Apple simply skims 30% of the revenue generated from these apps. The smartphone giant's only significant cost is that of payment processing (storage/delivery costs are largely negligible due to small app sizes). Initially, Apple broke even on the App Store in 2011 probably due to the high fixed-cost portion of credit card processing fees . However, in recent years, users have executed larger and larger in-app purchase transactions. A study by W3i found that 47% of in-app purchases were between $9.99-$19.99, meaning that Apple's economics on the App Store is trending very favorably. Keep in mind that this was in 2013 - current percentages are likely to be greater. Apple adopts a similar middleman model with iTunes. As a result, I suspect that a bulk of Apple's $18b in revenue for its iTunes segment is pure profit. The contribution to overall profit is quite astounding if one considers that Apple made $70b in gross profit in 2014 and nearly $40b in net profit. For every thousand songs streamed on Apple Music, Apple will be down $2.47 . However, the key thing to note is that this figure is largely fixed (although future negotiations might change things). With a largely fixed cost base, the model is highly scalable. Note that Apple does not produce the music and therefore avoids the costs associated with music production. As for Apple Pay, Cupertino is to receive 15 cents for every $100 transaction . Costs seem minimal here as well, considering that Apple is working with existing payment processing such as Visa (NYSE: V ) - I suspect the credit card company would be bearing a majority of the costs associated with processing payments. At scale, Apple Music and Apple Pay are likely to achieve extremely high margins and contribute significantly to Apple's bottom line. Not only do these businesses provide cash flow visibility as they tend to be recurring in nature (provided that Apple is able to maintain or grow its user base, which it has for the most part), they serve to further strengthen Apple's moat by augmenting its ecosystem. In conclusion, Apple has managed to build up a sizable and loyal iOS user base while avoiding the common pitfalls (product concentration) that mobile phone companies often face (see Motorola and Nokia) by ensuring a high degree of customer lock-in through the provision of an ecosystem. This ecosystem is likely to be durable due to the numerous competitive advantages that the company possesses (stemming from scale, intangible assets and switching costs). The company is beginning to shift to asset-light, high-margin, middlemen businesses which will not only be wildly profitable at scale and contribute significantly to the company's bottom line, but also will serve to strengthen the overall ecosystem. Without a doubt, Apple is a wonderful business and should continue to be so in the future. Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
