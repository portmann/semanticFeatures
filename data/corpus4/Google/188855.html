Facebook Becomes The 'Business Partner' Of SMBs With Pages Updates - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Facebook is out with meaningful updates to Pages. I believe these updates do more than just make the SMB experience better - I believe theses updates will make the user experience better as well. Facebook is smart to cater to SMBs, as the TAM is much larger than that of enterprise and frankly it just makes more sense. Facebook should be able to drive positive outcomes for SMBs by becoming their primary hosting platform for "web" services - this is a good thing for the financials. Look for Facebook to leverage this momentum into greater Instagram ad capture as well as pass-through revenues for other ancillary services. Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) wants to be the small/medium business (SMB) owner's one-stop shop; "you don't need a Wix (NASDAQ: WIX ) or a Wordpress page" location for all his or her customer engagement and online presence needs. And why not? The SMB space is much, much larger than the enterprise space in aggregate, is generally more sticky, doesn't run as high a risk of commoditization of services, and fits much more in line with Facebook's "intimacy" based core user value-prop. I've argued in the past that unlike Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ), which has a newsy, discovery-based value prop to users, that Facebook's value prop and UX is based on intimacy and familiarity. It's my opinion that users view their Facebook pages as threads in the fabric of their life, whereas Twitter users view their accounts as the new newspaper. For me, Facebook targeting the SMB with Pages and the seemingly constant evolution of Pages to better fit SMBs' is a marriage that's made to last. But maybe the biggest reason that Facebook wants to be the SMB "business partner" is that the SMB owner is typically not a business owner at all - typically these are product people or idea people. What do I mean by this? I mean usually the flower shop owner knows flowers, not how to run the most efficient business - especially when that comes to online. For instance, the local florist isn't going to school anybody on webpage design or backend payment system integration to a webpage. The local florist isn't going to lay out the case for the next great growth-hacking method or even how to construct high conversion blog posts. But, with the help of Facebook this isn't a concern. The SMB owner can simply set up a Facebook page for his or her SMB, a process he or she is already familiar with because the UI and enrollment process is the exact same as that on the personal page side, and voila - instant online presence on the largest social network in the history of the planet. One that now refers more traffic to news sites - an example of its traffic flow influence - than Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ). So Facebook is smart to target the SMBs. Facebook is also smart to constantly make things easier for the SMBs and to proactively try to drive more and more positive outcomes for the SMBs. Recently, Facebook took this effort one step further with apparent updates to Pages. It appears now that 1) Pages has a different customer-facing look, 2) Pages has much more optionality from a customization and customer-facing standpoint, and 3) Pages has new functionality for SMBs. The last bullet is really, really important for Facebook equity investors to pay attention to, as it's something that I think will drive key metrics on an immediate basis and also help convert Pages owners to Instagram owners/ad buyers. Let's break out the above paragraph by bullet point. First, for those that don't operate a Pages account or who aren't in the business of helping others do this, Pages has some serious new additions, as it pertains to being customer-facing. Now, each Page not only has the classic Timeline setup for incoming public posts but it also has a silo display, which separates out Home, Services, Photos, and Shop silos. Don't think that matters? It does. A simple Google search will show that users typically only give a new idea (read: a new Page) a mere seconds before abandoning/exiting. If the user has to struggle to find what they want - prior to the silo-based aesthetics of Pages, this was a cluttered, mess-driven problem for most Page owners - they bail. Bailing isn't good for the SMBs' business and it isn't good for Facebook being associated with driving positive outcomes - positive outcomes that by association would likely (and have shown to likely) drive advertising revenue opportunity. Facebook de-cluttering the Page for the Page owner is huge. That's a great start. Pages now also has more optionality for how a Page owner can communicate with prospective customers. Specifically, from a top-of-funnel standpoint. Pages now offers several new call-to-action (CTA)) options that include options like "Call Now" - which is the most exciting of the options in my opinion. Facebook still offers previously available CTAs like "Contact Us", "Use App", etc. I've opined in the past that I think eventually Facebook charges for "recurring engagement" conversion for SMB's/enterprises. This would include items like App downloads (it sort of already does charge for this in its ability to charge a premium for advertising services based on its effectiveness for driving positive outcomes), newsletter enrollments, and other off-platform conversions. The point to be made here for this bullet point is that Facebook just became that much more of a one-stop shop with its now one-click ability to create a call converter out of your Page. Easy enough to understand but you better bet that matters in the scheme of things. Finally, and maybe most importantly, Pages now has a new functionality. The addition of Shop and Services silos as a focus of the UI is huge. Huge like I can't even really do it justice in explanation huge. Think of these silos now being made a focus as the webpagification (not a word but expressive to the point of using) of the Page. This is what I'm referring to when I point out that Facebook is now giving mobile-first SMBs the ability to avoid Wix/Wordpress/Squarespace. Now that I have a "full web page"/desktop-like experience via Pages, what do I need a full web page/desktop experience driver for? I don't is the answer - and that's a great thing for Facebook. In fact, if I want to focus on a particular product launch, I can even use Instagram to launch a full-scale, high-definition advertising campaign, which will also be linked back and inserted directly into my Page Timeline as well as my Shop feed. How conveniently convenient. Are you starting to see why Facebook's Pages focus is meaningful to the overall bull thesis? If Facebook's wide reach yet capacity to stay "local" in feel wasn't enough a reason for an SMB to initiate a Pages setup, these new additions should make the case even stronger. I just don't see any reason for any business in any vertical to not participate. I think the growth of Pages in volume as well as the ancillary revenue expansion from ad campaign participation and overall engagement data that Facebook can use to perpetuate the cycle of both is a huge tailwind for Facebook equity that should have staying power. I actually think, like all things Facebook, this tailwind grows in time. As Facebook, I'm speculating here, continues to make Pages more attractive for SMBs, I anticipate an eventual secondary career vertical being built on top of the platform - similar to how there are entire firms now deriving revenue streams exclusively off Wix/Wordpress/Squarespace expertise. When that happens, "look out above" from a growth standpoint. But with that being speculation and impossible to determine from a duration standpoint, just focus for now on what's already in place. Facebook is continuing to evidence itself as the premium home for SMB online presence and that's going to do big things for key metrics and for the equity.
