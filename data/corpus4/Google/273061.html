Why I Was Wrong Shorting Apple - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha In June 2015 I submitted an article titled why 'I’m Selling Apple And Buying Microsoft.' The thesis for the pair trade relied on the release of Windows 10 and Microsoft’s effort to narrow its competitive disadvantage. After watching this unfold I think my thesis to short Apple is too convoluted. The possible significance of Microsoft’s universal apps is more widely understood, but because of limited traction it isn’t what’s moving the needle. In June 2015 I submitted an article titled, Why I'm selling Apple And Buying Microsoft , to a Seeking Alpha contest for a pair trade. The trade did well but I chalk it up to luck: The S&P 500 delivered approximately a 3% negative total return over the same timeframe. The thesis for the pair trade relied on the release of Windows 10 and Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) effort to narrow its competitive disadvantage compared to Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) on the Mobile OS front. Or as I put it (slightly edited to improve readability): Most likely this plays out is with little initial response by the market, as the market is well aware of the release. How the developer community responds probably matters a great deal. In theory, Windows 10 features are very interesting but how does it all work together in practice? If the market starts to pick up on favorable feedback, I think the market will bid up Microsoft's stock by 10%-20% because of the increased future cash flows it anticipates on the back of increased future market share. Theoretically, some of that market value should be siphoned away from Apple and Google right away. In practice, it can take a while before people can let go of Apple. It has been such a market darling for so long. Make no mistake though, if Windows 10 really does gain traction, it can take a big bite out of Apple's market value. Apple has short product cycles and every one of its hardware products suddenly faces increased competitive pressure. When a competitor has a richer ecosystem and lower priced products, I do not want to put my money on people's brand loyalty. The company will need to respond by lowering prices or other countermeasures. Before you know it a year has passed and the stock is down 10%-20% as the market slowly adjusts its models to the new competitive environment. The problem with my story right now is that I believe it is kind of disconnected from the moves in both Microsoft and Apple. I can't be sure of course, but I don't believe the story line of the potential of Microsoft putting a serious dent in Apple's mobile OS market share convinced many investors. The project to enable automated porting of Android apps: Astoria, was even shut down. It is not a surprise the media hasn't embraced the Universal app story because of its lack of early success, as per the Verge : It's still really early days for Windows 10 and the future of the universal app platform. Netflix is available on Windows 10 PCs and tablets today, but the phone and Xbox versions are still separate and not universal. That will change over the coming months, but it highlights the challenges of convincing developers to build these apps. "We've got a long ways to go in our Store yet to get to the scale that we want," explains Mehdi. Netflix, Uber, Shazam, Twitter, and others are a good start, but there are thousands more big apps to go until Microsoft can say universal apps are a success. At the same time, the slump in Apple's stock is much more likely to have been caused by analysts increasingly bearish expectations for iPhone sales. One of the things I'm currently spending a bit of time on, is my own estimate of iPhone sales for the December quarter and my initial work shows it is going to be a close call whether 75 million units sold will be exceeded. However, at this time I don't want to rely on it to try and continue to support my bear case. I don't hate my initial call of long Microsoft/short Apple, but I want to come out and say I'm not behind this position any more. Coverage indicates performance so far has likely been mostly the result of sheer luck and driven by factors other than those underlying my thesis. The possible significance of Microsoft's universal apps is more widely understood, but because of limited traction it isn't what's moving the needle yet. The Microsoft long is the leg of this position that I'm most comfortable with and I think this will continue to be a fine long. Limited risk due to a strong balance sheet, strong competitive advantages and strong upside potential if it is able to win big market share in Mobile OS after all. I still believe, over time, Windows 10 and universal apps could start to make a big difference here. The Apple short leg is one I recommend taking off at this time. My reasoning just doesn't hold up that well and the stock has declined quite a bit. The stock's performance appears mostly tied to iPhone sales and the threat of Microsoft's app ecosystem vastly improving isn't playing much of a role. Therefore it seems much wiser to me to bet solely on the Microsoft ecosystem improving by going long Microsoft. The short Apple is a position that could end up losing money even though the thesis actually plays out. Meanwhile it isn't the best choice to just hedge out general (TECH) market risk. It's just too complicated of a thesis where lots of things have to go right. To continue to justify it, better insight into iPhone sales would help much more. In summary I continue to like the long Microsoft but the Apple short, not so much. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
