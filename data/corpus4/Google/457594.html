The online retailer said today that the holiday it created for itself brought in 60% more orders worldwide than last yearâ€™s Prime Day. In the U.S., orders went up by more than 50%, Amazon said , though it declined to reveal its total sales or how many people signed up for Prime so they could participate. “We want to thank our tens of millions of members around the world for making this the biggest day in the history of Amazon,” Greg Greeley, Vice President of Amazon Prime said in the statement. The retailer said Prime members saved more than double the amount they did last Prime Day, buying things in the U.S. like multi-functional pressure cookers (215,000 sold); headphones (200,000 sold); not single but double hammocks (24,000); and Roomba Vacuum Cleaning Robots (23,000 sold), just to name a few. While there were some hiccups reported, as expected after last year’s troubles , things seemed to go a bit smoother, at least judging by social media reactions: according to Adobe Digital Insights, only 39% of overall sentiment around Amazon Prime Day was related to sadness, compared to 50% last year, and feelings of joy about the event reached 30%, up from 23% in 2015. Sadness hit its peak on social media later in the day, when “odd deals” started popping up and folks started reporting issues with checking out. Last year’s grumpiness was due in large to a lack of great deals, Adobe Digital Insights notes. This apparent success means Prime Day will live on, the company says, noting that “after yesterday’s results, we’ll definitely be doing this again.” Are Amazon’s Month-To-Month Prime Memberships Ever Worth The Extra Money?
