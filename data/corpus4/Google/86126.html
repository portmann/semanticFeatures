Apple's Debt-Funded Repurchases: Terrific Or Terrible? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Much of Apple's earned cash lies overseas where it's unavailable for share repurchases without paying US income tax on repatriation. Apple has issued bonds repeatedly since initiating its share repurchase program, including in non-US currencies. On recent quarterly calls, analysts have asked about Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) foreign currency headwinds and their effect on Apple's finances. Exposure to non-operational factors such as currency exchange rates poses a risk not only to the impact of foreign earnings as measured in U.S. dollars but the value (in U.S. dollars) of Apple's foreign-held cash. This article discusses both Apple's operational ability to maintain margins in the recent foreign exchange environment and Apple's effectiveness in using foreign-issued debt as a tax planning tool. Although Apple remains a premium brand that commands top dollar for products, it has internally transformed itself to a high-volume manufacturer with tight control on its unit costs. Apple's CEO Tim Cook has, in fact, described himself as "the Attila the Hun of inventory." Among Apple's greatest advantages in competition is Apple's superior margins . Low per-unit costs allow Apple to present competition at every price point it likes, without fear that competitors can earn enough to present credible competition for the bulk of its business. Ownership of key technologies - the iPhone's chip design and the Unix-based operating systems at the heart of all its products - allows Apple to amortize fixed development costs across growing global unit sales, preserving margins advantages over competitors who must acquire key technologies from third parties and share their associated revenues. Nevertheless, commentators continue to predict that Apple's first mover advantage will fade and, with it, Apple's margins. This view falsely assumes that cell phones, or even smartphones, were a field so new Apple could have had a "first-mover" advantage when it entered the market in 2007. But let's look at the trend line in operating margins: Nokia (NYSE: NOK ) and BlackBerry (NASDAQ: BBRY ) have operating margins less than 1%. Although Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT ) bought Nokia's handset business in 2014, its margins are dominated by software licensing in market segments like servers and tools, desktop operating systems, and application software. Only the software companies on the chart - Microsoft and Google Corp. (NASDAQ: GOOG )(NASDAQ: GOOGL ) - enjoy operating margins that, like Apple's, are in the double digits. But the 10-year chart doesn't show Apple losing its margins advantage. Rather, it shows Apple pulling ahead even of its software vendor competitors. (Apple is the blue line with the top number.) So it's not a great surprise that when foreign exchange headwinds were predicted to eat up to 100 basis points of Apple's worldwide gross margin, which was anticipated to keep Apple's gross margins between 38.5% and 39.5% for the March-ending quarter, Apple managed nevertheless to raise gross margins to 40.8% for the quarter. Because Apple owns so much of the intellectual property in its products - most competitors buy third-party CPUs for high-end phones instead of contracting fabricators to make their own designs - Apple keeps more of the revenue it generates from every device. Apple has grown rather than lost its margins advantage. In expanding its cash return program to $200 billion , Apple recently announced that in addition to increasing its dividend, it's also adding $50 billion to its share repurchase authorization. Onlookers see Tim Cook retiring 20% of Apple's outstanding shares . A limiting factor in Apple's repurchase program has been the location of its earnings. Most of Apple's $178 billion cash on hand is located offshore where it was earned . Since the exchanges on which Apple shares trade are in the U.S., Apple can't buy the shares without "repatriating" the money and - in the process - subjecting it to elevated U.S. income tax rates. Applying a tax haircut to Apple's offshore after-tax cash would run against shareholder interest by decreasing Apple's assets. When share buybacks reduce cash on-hand, they also reduce the share count so each investor holds a bigger piece of the company. Volunteering for avoidable taxes offers no similar virtue. Apple could certainly spend foreign-held cash on foreign-sited purchases like the company's recent acquisition of the German augmented reality software firm Metaio , but there's just not hundreds of billions in good acquisition deals that fit Apple's product roadmap. Apple gets better performance pitting foreign assembler suppliers against one another in bidding wars than owning them. The 19 Apple Stores now in China don't cost that much. The fact is, Apple is raking in cash faster than it can spend it building its business - and keeping idle capital on the books helps nobody. Repurchases don't change Apple's results as a firm, but nevertheless improve performance for shareholders. Repurchases reduce the capital with which Apple its earns its revenues and reduce the denominator by which all Apple's per-share metrics are calculated. The result is better capital performance and superior per-share metrics: each non-selling shareholder owns a bigger and bigger fraction of the whole firm as repurchases continue. As previously described here , it's this kind of share-count reduction that Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A ) (NYSE: BRK.B ) Chairman Warren Buffett anticipated following his firm's purchase of 5.5% of the outstanding shares of International Business Machines Inc. (NYSE: IBM ). The point of loving share repurchases was to own even more of a worthy target company down the road without spending a cent. (See Buffett's 2011 letter to shareholders , at p.7.) The repurchases suggest Tim Cook appreciates the advice Warren Buffett gave Steve Jobs when the latter explained Apple wouldn't have opportunities to deploy significant amounts of its cash to acquire productive assets. Selling bonds abroad gives Apple foreign cash that Apple can turn into dollars and spend in the U.S. without paying income tax on it because it's not profit. They are loan proceeds. Comparing Apple's interest rate to its tax rate makes the transaction look cheap, especially when one considers some of the rates Apple pays. Last year, Apple's two-part Swiss Franc issuance bore interest rates of 0.74% and 0.281% . Apple's recent Yen issuance paid only 0.350% . By taking debt in foreign currencies, Apple also removes some volatility from its balance sheet: every quarter, Apple's SEC-compliance-driven GAAP accounting disclosures value Apple's cash and debt in US-dollar terms - irrespective of Apple's local-currency performance. By offsetting non-dollar assets with non-dollar debt, Apple removes some foreign exchange volatility from its quarterly performance measurement. By reducing the impact of foreign exchange on Apple's quarterly performance measurements, Apple concentrates the performance metrics on Apple's performance - which for Apple is a good thing. The concern that Apple's competitors are catching up to it by selling software that better leverages available hardware sounds terrible, until one considers that most Android customers don't have software current enough to enjoy Android's supposed new advantages … … and notice that Samsung's Galaxy S6 Edge costs Samsung more to make than the iPhone 6 it's designed to attack. Samsung can't possibly price its premium product at a point that would prevent Apple's profits without joining the mass of money-losing handset makers Apple has left in the dust. As explained before, Samsung may sell more raw units but Apple's ownership of the most valuable IP in each device gives Apple better margins and more profit in every unit it sells. Although Apple Pay quickly became the most popular mobile payment system at Whole Foods Market Inc. (NASDAQ: WFM ), Apple's new services revenue stream has yet to demonstrate its potential. The "disappointment" Apple's customers perceive in stores when trying to use Apple Pay turns out to be disappointment with the speed with which stores roll out the technology needed to make contactless payment systems work in the U.S. Apple's upcoming U.K. Apple Pay rollout should provide information on Apple's success in the field compared to competitors: contactless payment in the U.K. has been up and running for years . Apple Pay supports the cards that conduct most of the U.S. purchase volume , but making it practically available to retailers worldwide will take time. Once Apple Pay is widely available to retailers, there's no reason Apple should not work to build the business into the world's largest payment processor. Apple's position in enterprise hardware has been pretty poor over the years with Apple dropping server hardware unexpectedly and not bothering to deliver back-end tools intended to administer large installations. Now that the Apple Store supplies so much software and International Business Machines Inc. has begun rolling out enterprise software for Apple products, the moves needed to make Apple a serious Enterprise player are much easier to see. Already a Fortune 500 favorite in mobile devices, and the world leader in high-end desktops and notebooks , Apple is now cracking the corporate desktop world with IBM's 50,000-Mac decision to allow employees to select a Mac as easily as its competitors as a primary workstation. At Cisco Systems Inc. (NASDAQ: CSCO ), a similar decision led to 25% Mac share among company-owned notebooks. Since Apple doesn't sell loss-leader hardware and runs the store through which it's easiest to track software licenses and installation versions, a huge share jump in hardware could have ripple effects in Apple's non-hardware businesses. Apple's margins advantage shows little evidence of succumbing to the faddish slump naysayers have predicted since the year after the iPhone launched, and its plan to repurchase shares promises to improve per-share metrics so as to multiply the disparity between the ratio of its price per share and its earnings per share … … and the >20 P/E of the S&P 500 at date of this article. Trading unproductive cash for a smaller denominator in all Apple's per-share metrics is good for all who hold shares - and doing it with money not taxed at U.S. tax rates is cheaper than doing it with dollars already taxed at the highest possible rate. Moreover, adding non-dollar debt allows Apple to cancel some of the foreign exchange volatility created by its significant non-US cash holdings. Apple's share repurchases are sensible, shareholder-friendly and will magnify the per-share result of Apple's strategic gains as it expands its addressable market with more stores, strategic relationships and a growing global services business. Using cheap debt to finance share retirement while Apple's P/E lags the broader market will turbocharge future per-share performance. Management has this one right.
