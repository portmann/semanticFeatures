Why Facebook Remains A High Conviction Long Idea - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Facebook's ad experience continues to improve, as targeted advertising has improved conversions, click-through-rates and engagement. This corresponds to the data points presented by third-party firms, and is indicative of the potential growth in the business going forward. Of all the ad formats that are currently being monitored, the fastest growing format is programmatic ad buying, i.e. ad-retargeting. This all translates into an increasing likelihood of Facebook generating a beat on top line. Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) seems extremely well positioned in the digital advertising space, as indicated by the growth in ad dollars chasing the platform, and commentary from various programmatic ad firms building the business model. That being the case, Facebook still trades at a high valuation relative to peers, as its valuation is contingent on the company's ability to deliver a considerable amount of growth and earnings in the foreseeable future. Therefore, investors are buying higher, and selling even higher, the very definition of what a growth/momentum-oriented investor is looking for, and anyone who finds this type of strategy unappealing should probably avoid investing into Facebook. The company's management team had some interesting comments to share at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media & Telecom Conference: But then they worked with our targeting systems and we were able to identify people that on basis of age and gender and location and characteristics and interest, they look like their current customers, but are not their current customers and able to show another whole set of ads to them and now we're getting 80% of their marketing budget, because they've never seen anything this effective. While the first part is interesting, the second set of comments attracted even more of my attention: And so the ability to have the broad reach of a Super Bowl every day, but to do this kind of micro targeting, identify people who are like your customers, do a 1,000 different 30-second spots for Lexus. We think that's pretty unique and we're working hard with our clients to ramp up their use of this proprietary targeting, but it takes time and it takes investment and I think we're still at the beginning of the process there. Now remember, Facebook attracts much of the 18+ demographic, which is where the lion share of consumer dollars are actually at. According to Ipsos: 88% visited one of 12 measured social networks in the previous week, led by Facebook, which was visited by 70% of Affluents for an average of 5.7 hours. So, Facebook isn't just well positioned in comparison to other social platforms, it's extremely well positioned because it's attracting all the people who actually have money to buy products via the native ad units that are displayed on the newsfeed. It's not going to come as any surprise to anyone, therefore, that Facebook's business model continues to scale effectively, as it's able to target advertising and have a promising network model via Atlas, which may allow for better ad targeting even on shared devices, as Facebook becomes the new identifier to a person's identity and activity on the web. As indicated by a third-party programmatic ad firm, Facebook adds considerable value to their ad inventory, as the added integration into Facebook has increased the amount of conversions by approximately 73%. This indicates that advertisers have to position ads on Facebook, as Facebook offers a considerable advantage in comparison to other platforms. Now for those who aren't very familiar to the programmatic ad business, I explain in greater detail in my prior article, and re-targeting in a different article. But basically, programmatic ad buying is where advertisers are able to standardize ad units using a consistent metric across all formats and are able to buy in bulk to target the same exact audience. Eventually marketers are able to direct their intended audience down a sales funnel, as they're able to reposition an ad wherever the prospective customer is at, on the web. Now remember, they also have the ability to adjust the frequency in which to display the same exact ad, and are able to change the message depending on how a customer will likely respond to that same respective ad. Currently, re-targeting, i.e. programmatic ad buying is more effective than the individualized ad formats that many marketers have banked on, in the past. From my own experience, e-mail used to be the reigning king of advertising, followed by search advertising, but now it's become obvious that to truly market a product to a consumer, the same advertiser has to frequently market to the same customer, regardless of website, app and format. The inclusion of Facebook's ad inventory has only added further momentum to the business model of various programmatic ad bidding models, and quite frankly, it's likely that both the publisher and marketer ecosystem is likely to benefit, as added efficiency is required in order to defray the rising cost of CPMs (cost per thousand impressions). Furthermore, certain publishers like Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Facebook have a rapidly growing audience, as ad pricing continues to trend higher, as linear-TV is starting to become a less desired ad-format. Also, according to eMarketer, much of the growth in programmatic ad bidding is coming from mobile, and quite frankly, it's no surprise given the rapid growth and emergence of both tablet and smartphone devices, which are fairly effective at content consumption, despite being less desirable for work-situations. I mean, when was the last time your boss ever commended you for clicking on an ad while you were at work? Jokes aside, the growth in programmatic ad bidding, has played favorably into Facebook's ARPU trends (average revenue per user), and assuming Facebook is able to translate more of that success onto Instagram, high-rates of growth are likely to stay intact. Currently, sell-side analysts are optimistic on Facebook, as indicated by the current consensus estimate for sales growth of 37.3% for FY 2015. Admittedly, the sell-side is pretty conservative on their expectations, because it's not exactly clear whether Facebook can drive the same kind of growth in CPMs as it did in the prior FY, and whether a sizable increase in audience, will defray a slower growth rate in CPMs. Even so, based on the points raised by management, at the Morgan Stanley Conference, and the commentary via programmatic platforms, the stock is well positioned, and could generate a meaningful beat on top-line. It's not exactly clear whether bottom line results will beat, as the company is currently in an investment year, where they have to ramp-up headcount, and increase capital outlays for office space, acquisitions, and servers. I continue to reiterate my positive stance on Facebook, as the company has built significant value into its ad business model, as competing platforms are seen as less of a priority in comparison (from the perspective of marketers). Facebook's integration into real-time bidding platforms, and the creation of its own RTB platform for a network of advertisers is indicative of where Facebook could be five to ten years down the road. While, I'm not modeling a forecast for long-term sales and earnings in this specific article, I'm fairly confident that the data and analysis presented will aid in the due diligence process. Facebook remains a high conviction buy.
