Apple: Why Privacy Protection Helps, Not Hurts, Its Business - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha WWDC introduced numerous new security and privacy protections for Apple's operating systems. At the same time, Apple has balanced privacy with enhanced user data collection to support more intelligent search results and user assistance. As WWDC 2015 draws to a close, it strikes me that the most important improvements Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has made to its operating systems are in the areas of security and privacy. It has been asserted that this limits Apple needlessly and may hurt Apple's competitiveness. I disagree, but putting a price tag on the value of privacy to Apple's users is difficult, compared to, say, putting a price tag on the value of advertising. With the next major releases of its key operating systems, iOS and Mac OS X, Apple has added new layers of security to each. For the most part, these new layers are intended to mitigate the weakest link in computer security: the computer user. Apple has recognized that unsophisticated users frequently employ easily guessable or hackable passwords. This is especially a problem for Mac OS X, which doesn't have the level of security protection of iOS. Mac computer owners typically have administrative privileges by default. If their password is compromised, hackers can modify the operating system at will and use this access to defeat Apple's built-in security protocols. Apple's answer to this is what it calls System Integrity Protection (SIP), a completely new feature for Mac OS X El Capitan. With SIP, even an administrative level user can't modify key system level files and processes, or write to areas where these are stored. Since most Mac users don't try to modify their operating systems, there's no impact to the average user's Mac experience. iOS also got a security boost in the form of a new operating system component called Secure Enclave (NYSE: SE ). SE provides an encrypted and impenetrable (to hackers) region of memory where passwords and security keys can be kept. Touch ID functionality and Keychain for password storage now reside within SE. iOS also addresses the problem of user password negligence with "two factor" authentication, something security experts have long advocated. For many security sensitive operations, just entering a device passcode will no longer suffice. Apple will send a second authentication passcode to the user's other registered devices via iCloud, which must also be entered. How well Apple's authentication scheme works in practice remains to be seen, but it should at least head off one of the most common compromise scenarios: a stolen phone being unlocked due to a weak or easily guessed password. Unlocking a stolen iPhone allows the thieves to reset it, blocking any further attempt to locate it via FindiPhone. Two factor authentication should prevent this. These changes and many others that Apple rolled out at WWDC help to close significant security gaps that have existed in Apple's key platforms. At the conference, Apple presenters repeatedly emphasized the importance of user security and privacy. In some cases, presenters even went so far as to admonish developers suggesting that attempts to circumvent Apple's security and privacy policies could lead to rejection of an app. But is Apple going too far in its preoccupation with security and user privacy? Certainly, CEO Tim Cook has taken a very strong stand in favor or privacy. His speech to the Electronic Privacy Information Center declared privacy to be a fundamental human right. He also rejected providing security "back doors" for law enforcement. Such back doors can be implemented in various ways, but typically it would involve creating special encryption keys that unlock secure regions of the operating system, such as Secure Enclave in iOS 9. Following Cook's speech, an article appeared in Fortune asserting that privacy had become a "blind spot" for Apple that limited its ability to create more intelligent search and user assistance features being pioneered by Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOGL ) and others. Similarly, an article in The Verge offered this assessment of iCloud: Fact is, Apple is behind on web services. Its highly successful strategy of using iTunes software to create a digital hub in the home sold a lot of Apple hardware. But it also left the company woefully ill prepared to provide cloud computing in the post PC era. iCloud continues to stumble forward like a neglected toddler. One encounters such trashing of iCloud frequently in the tech business press. iCloud is not without flaws, but it has nevertheless been a key factor in the success of Apple's iOS ecosystem. Whether it's automatic syncing document revisions or recent iTunes or App Store purchases, for most users, myself included, iCloud just works. If Apple has missed opportunities in cloud services due to privacy concerns, there was a strong indication at WWDC that this is about to change. In addition to beefing up security, Apple also rolled out a host of new features intended to provide more intelligence in search and in Siri, Apple's voice recognition assistant. Apple's built-in search feature for Mac OS X and iOS, Spotlight, is planned to become much more intelligent in the new platform versions. Spotlight will now be able to offer suggestions based on user history for apps and personal contacts. Clearly, Apple intends to collect usage data from users, in the way that Google does now. But there are key differences between the Apple and Google models. The data that Apple collects for the benefit of its own search the company will keep to itself. Developers of apps for its platforms are not given access to this data, and a developer who attempts to gain access will get kicked off the App Store. Apple won't try to monetize the data either by selling it or through targeted advertising. Developers may employ targeted advertising within their own apps, but only after clearing it with the user. Similarly, Apple provides permission mechanisms that both inform the user of what data it's collecting and why, and provide a means of easily opting out. Apple clearly recognizes the value of intelligent use of user data in order to make services like search and Siri more effective. There's no blind spot about this. But there's a completely different set of priorities from Google. Apple's business model has no need to monetize user information, whereas Google depends on such monetization. This brings us to the difficult part - how to assess the value of Apple's approach. Assessing the value of Google's approach is easy. It's pretty much their entire corporate advertising revenue. One can make a fuzzy logic case for the appeal of iOS and especially Apple Pay on the basis of Apple protection of user privacy, but that still doesn't get us to a number, even a round number, valuation. Let me suggest an alternative path based on the following thesis. If Apple had not taken adequate measures to protect user privacy, Apple's expansion in China would not have been possible. The Chinese government would have thrown up numerous road blocks to Apple. The Chinese concern especially with U.S. government hacking of mobile devices and data collection is well known. Without Apple's guarantee that even the U.S. government couldn't hack Apple's devices, the Chinese would have locked Apple out of China. Apple's security and privacy policies have been key to Apple's success in China. What's China worth to Apple? An awful lot. Last quarter revenue from Greater China (including Hong Kong and Taiwan) was $16.8 billion, 29% of Apple's total revenue for the quarter. Revenue for Greater China was up 71% y/y. iPhone sales in particular benefited from China, growing 55% y/y. Apple's impressive iPhone sales momentum would not have been possible without China. If we take the Greater China revenue as a ball park estimate of the value of Apple's privacy considerations, then the mandate for privacy becomes very clear. The revenue from Greater China alone is more than Google's total advertising revenue in the same quarter of $15.508 billion.
