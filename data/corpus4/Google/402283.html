You Should Invest In Facebook's Mobile Video Dream - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Facebook's earnings call was a stellar one for sure, but one particular metric should not go unrecognized. The company's ad revenue lean is clearly towards mobile, and one more element will soon push it past critical mass. In an article I wrote on March 31 this year called Why Shorting Facebook Now Is Not The Right Strategy , I argued why I thought shorting Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) would be a disastrous idea despite the fact that I still held the opinion that the company was overvalued per current revenue streams. My case was built on the following: Their video advertising plans are still in a nascent stage, and there's a lot of work left to be done before they can reap the benefits. User growth was still significantly high because of multiple platforms, but they need to be tapped to their full potential. The crux of my argument was that, since there were too many unknown factors for an investor to dismiss their high valuation as fantasy or wishful thinking, it would be a bad idea to short the stock. That argument was validated when Facebook stock showed a near double-digit jump after their Q1 earnings report , where they showed improvement on every single metric possible. Facebook definitely had a stellar quarter, as recent articles on SA observed. Monthly active users and mobile monthly active users jumped 15% and 21% year over year, respectively. Total revenue for the quarter jumped by a whopping 52% YoY to reach $5.4 billion, while operating margin expanded by 11 percentage points to touch 37%. So the performance was not just user base and top line growth, but also bottom line as well. But there was one metric that caught my eye more than anything else, and it has huge implications for the company - not to mention its investors. And that is mobile advertising revenue. As you can see from the chart below, overall ad revenue has steadily grown over a period of time. But more to the point, mobile ad revenues are contributing in greater and greater measure to overall advertising revenues - and that's been the case for at least the past four years, as you can see. To put it another way, you could say that the growth in advertising revenue has been fueled by the growth in mobile advertising. Mobile ad revenue as a % of total ad revenue now accounts for 82%, up by 52% when compared to Q1-2013. One of the biggest challenges for any social media company is the ability to monetize its user base. Ask Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) and MySpace and they'll tell you it's true. In fact, not only has Facebook cracked that code, but to boot, they've penetrated the mobile ad space in a way very few companies have. If PCs and other non-mobile computing devices were to decline to zero, this would be one of the few companies left standing - and growing faster than anybody else. Again, as I've said before, the part of their user base that sits outside of existing revenue streams is where the high valuation is coming from. We're at the beginning of a golden age of online video. Video isn't just a single kind of content. We think it's a medium that allows people to interact in a lot of new ways. So that's why in addition to normal Internet video, we're also focusing on more interactive video experiences like Live and 360 video. I'm a big Game of Thrones fan, and the other week HBO and our Oculus team came out with a 360 video of the opening sequence of the show. And it's now the most watched 360 video on Facebook in any 24-hour period, with more than 12 million total views. Earlier this month, we opened up Live to everyone. Live is just one part of our overall video effort, but we think it has a lot of potential. Friends go Live because it's unfiltered and personal. Actors and news anchors go Live because they can reach bigger audiences in some cases than they can on even their own shows. And if we do a good job, we think it's something that people will associate with Facebook, with interacting with people and not just watching content. One example is Toyota used Facebook for the launch of the RAV4 Hybrid with Saatchi in Los Angeles. They used a very broad video to drive brand awareness. They reached over 36 million people in a target demo within three days. Then, and this is where it gets even more interesting, they retargeted people who watched the video with over 500 personalized video ads which were optimized for Facebook and Instagram. So they were creating a direct response campaign to get people to take specific actions like requesting a quote and finding a specific dealer. We saw a 14-point lift in ad recall, a seven-point lift in message association. And right now, we're using the Lift tool to continue to measure their sales for the 30 and 60 days beyond the campaign to see what happens. And we're pretty excited about what that shows in terms of how video can be used in a really broad-based way but also a more personal way. Despite their excitement over where their video business is going, it's the ad revenues that they're going after. As they dominate the mobile ad space, video will start contributing in a small way at first, then start growing in double digits until it finally finds its rightful place as Facebook's chief revenue earner. Right now they're building an entire ecosystem around video, and ad revenues from mobile video viewership are the epicenter of that ecosystem. Investor-speak: How to Invest in Facebook Facebook is clearly positioning itself as a mobile first, video first company - much the way Microsoft is doing with its mobile first, cloud first strategy. Because of its massive user base across several social apps, Facebook is probably the only company in the world that is in a position to rival Google's success with video advertising via YouTube. But Google has hit a wall because they don't have that social element going for them. Facebook is going through that wall on to the other side - where the real money is. YouTube's gross revenues are expected to go from $8.5 billion in 2015 to $12.8 billion in 2016. The moment Facebook is able to fully monetise its video channels, it will be directly targeting YouTube's advertiser base to catch up to that kind of revenue level. The bulk of that is going to come from mobile because that's the trend they've exhibited for regular ads. If they can manage that in the next two years, it'll be yet another feather in a cap that's already starting to resemble a bird! But as I slowly drift back to earth from Facebook's current position, I see their valuation as being "still high but could ultimately be justified." One, don't even think about shorting FB stock right now because they will be adding new and strong revenue streams over the next two years. Two, if you can't wait to get in, use a dollar-cost averaging method to build your position over a 2-3 year period. Your stock buys during any future earnings misses should ideally compensate for elevated levels at other times. In the long run, you'll benefit from owning a piece of a company that will define our online social world over the next several decades.
