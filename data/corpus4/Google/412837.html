The Bearish Case For Facebook - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Inability to monetize non English speaking countries. Six months ago, in a somewhat criticized article , I wrote that investing in Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) carried a high opportunity cost and better investment options exist. Facebook has since risen nearly 20% after reporting a phenomenal earnings release in Q1 2016. I'm maintaining my long-term view that better investment options exist and I'm adding three new arguments in support of this contrarian position. During the Q1 2016 earnings release , Facebook announced that 1.65 billion people used the social network at least once a month during that quarter. The company also disclosed that over 87% of those users are outside the United States and Canada. The global population today is slightly north of 7 billion. Who are the 5.5 billion people that did not use Facebook at least once a month in Q1 2016? In 2011, according to the Pew Research Center , 71% of the world's population was classified as low income (< $2/day) or poor ( < $10/day). We can assume a similar percentage exists today. This means 5 billion people live on less than $10 / day. Due to lack of telecommunications infrastructure and subsistence needs, it's safe to assume the majority of these people are not using Facebook. If these individuals were able to join, how attractive would they be to advertisers? Their disposable income levels are miniscule. Many likely live in rural areas in under developed or developing nations that lack access to transportation infrastructure for shipping or major commercial centers for shopping. How much will advertisers be willing to spend to market to them? Even if Facebook is able to connect the entire world (through Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Project Loon or Facebook's Internet.org), what is the economic value of these additional users? Is the economic value high enough to sustain Facebook's rate of growth? As disclosed in the Q1 2016 results, Facebook's user composition by geography is shown below. The United States and Canada accounted for 13% of all users and Europe added another 20%. The United States and Canada (13% of users) generated 51% of revenue. Europe (20% of users), which includes English speaking United Kingdom, generated 24% of revenue. Over 50% of Facebook's revenue is earned from English speaking countries that account for less than one-third of the company's users. Facebook has not proven it can monetize non English speaking users. This large outage is especially troublesome when considering where Facebook's future user growth is. The developing nations referenced in the section above are more similar to Rest of the World (32% of users / 9% of revenue) than they are to the United States or Canada. Even if Facebook can connect the entire world, it has not proven it can monetize the entire world. The company's future growth will be in its least profitable geographies. Any investor with knowledge of technology companies is aware that stock options are required to retain top talent. Skilled software engineers are in high demand. According to Google Finance , over the past three years, Facebook's shares outstanding have increased over 10% to pay for these stock options and for acquisitions. Investors interested in technology stocks do not have to put up with share dilution. Alphabet, still a growing company, announced a minor buyback ($5 Billion) last October. Apple ( AAPL ) is re-purchasing massive amounts of shares at now depressed prices. In conclusion, even with Facebook's continued growth, I believe better investment options exist. The advertising attractiveness of the remaining population is likely to be low. The company has not yet proven it can monetize non English speaking users. Unlike other tech companies (notably Apple and Alphabet), Facebook is diluting current shareholders for option based compensation and acquisitions. I am not stating that Facebook should be shorted. I'm stating that better investment options exist given Facebook's current valuation. Each of the three thesis points above has an easy to identify contrarian case. For the remaining population that is not on Facebook, when they do climb the economic ladder they will join. At that point advertisers will want to market to them. The lack of monetization for non English speaking users can be overcome with better consumer understanding. Issuance of new shares for acquisitions can be good if those acquisitions are sound. Instagram continues to grow in popularity and WhatsApp, which is very popular in the developing world, can serve as a gateway to the main social networking site.
