Shares of the social network fell 4.2 percent to $92.90 in after-hours trading on Wednesday. Facebook's total costs and expenses jumped 82 percent to $2.77 billion in the three months ended June 30. The company had warned that 2015 would be a year of heavy investment, but analysts have said these investments are likely to translate into significant revenue streams in coming years.
