The Thing About Windows 10 - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Windows is pushing Windows 10 on users with some success. It's a make-or-break effort to create server space against Apple on one end and Google on the other. The results of the current quarter will tell a lot. It was no big deal. My user interface didn't change. I didn't need a disk. It all downloaded in the background and installed itself. The computer didn't get faster, nor did it get slower, as in past Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) upgrades. Previous versions of Windows competed only with themselves. They were distributed as discrete products, users upgraded with cash, and the versions competed with one another. Even after killing support for Windows XP, there were still hundreds of millions of XP machines out there. All these machines, and their successors, became vulnerable to hacks, malware, and bloat. Users have become accustomed to buying a bunch of add-on products - ad-blockers and grime cleaners, anti-virals and speeder-uppers - to keep things going. This is not just true on the consumer level. It's also true in corporate accounts. The cloud and device era made all this obsolete, and Microsoft was very slow to respond. The company first thought it could offer a crippled version of Windows, then it tried a different type of Windows. What it needed to do was make a complete break with the past, a Windows that would compete directly with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iOS on the high-end and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Android on the low-end. A client operating system that is constantly updated, so everyone's on the same page, is less vulnerable to attack because bugs can be stomped out centrally. A secure operating system can also run servers, which remain a thing, just not on the top of the computing stack. Clouds are now the top of the stack, servers are basically PCs with connections to devices below, productivity applications at the center, and central storage on the cloud. As a middle ground device OS, Windows doesn't have much going for it. Critics will call it a Macy's (NYSE: M ) in a world that either wants Apple's version of Nordstrom (NYSE: JWN ) or Google's version of WalMart (NYSE: WMT ). The hope is that by creating something that's as useful as a home server but as simple as a client, but which also runs the productivity applications (like Office) corporations depend upon, Microsoft can get the space needed to grab a competitive market share against its two rivals. The only way to do that, of course, is to do what Apple did with U2. Don't just give it away, but push the giveaway on people. Ask them, prod them, and finally insist on the upgrade. Already, just two weeks after its first release, Windows 10 is running on 3.55% of all Windows machines. This is a good start, and it is making a dent in the huge mistake that was Windows 8.1 , although Windows 7 users (like me) have been slow to get on board. Critics and the media won't take this lying down. Windows 10 is being called Microsoft's pay-pay-pay plan. But can any operating system be maintained and kept secure without cost? Apple and Google keep the money flowing through planned hardware obsolescence, and that is at the heart of what Microsoft is going to do over the next months and years - encourage its users to depend on the cloud, then pay for new front-ends and maintenance on a schedule. Microsoft will have to spend some time, then, paying for the sins of its past, and CEO Satya Nadella doesn't have much time to waste. Microsoft usually brings 30% of its revenue to its bottom line - the last quarter was an aberration as it wrote-off Steve Ballmer's second-favorite mistake, Nokia. (I'd say his favorite these days is Clipper guard Chris Paul, but that's another column.) Investors are expecting a return to normal when Microsoft reports in September, but there won't be a lot of Windows licensing cash to spread around, and the successful Azure cloud and XBox game machine may not fill the gap. Nadella badly needs to get some good news from users, so here's some. The Windows 10 upgrade is pretty painless, you already know how to use it if you have any earlier version of the operating system, and it won't overtax your hardware. We'll see how many agree with me in a few months. I'll give away something from Green Day here. Wake me up when September ends. Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL, GOOGL.
