Ford Will Raise Its Dividend, But How Much? - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford has been committed to raising the dividend since bringing it back in 2012. Ford has been posting record sales and low oil prices have driven increased high margin truck sales and their earning reports are finally showing signs of life. Ford shareholders deserve something for sticking with an under-performing stock, but a dividend increase won't add long term value. An aggressive stock buyback program would be a nice announcement with the dividend increase and could add a lot of value going into the future. But don't count on it. Ford is a company that I personally believe in. They were the first "real" company that I invested my money in and I intend to pass down the stock to my children. I'm both invested via their stock and also four vehicles that wear the Blue Oval so my mind is always on the long term when thinking about Ford. I'm looking forward to the dividend increase but hope it isn't too much. With the final quarter of the year winding to a close there is a lot of speculation if Ford (NYSE: F ) will announce a dividend raise, and even more speculation on how much it will be. I think by taking a look at their recent financials and the limited recent dividend history we can more accurately gage the expected increase. Ford has not been very popular with their long term shareholders, and patience is wearing thin for many. Would a dividend increase of a few pennies a quarter do much for the company, or would a larger buyback program be more beneficial and perhaps raise share price more over time? I'm going to cover several possible scenarios and have some fun with numbers. In Q3 2015 Ford reported having $14.6B in cash on hand, their short term debt came in at just over $13B and long term tips the scales at a massive $113.3B which stretches to 2046. Diving into their bonds tells a more complete story of their debt structure and their BBB- credit rating. (Image from Morningstar) In the immediate term they don't have very much that will be coming to maturity, and only one bond of $25M is callable so there isn't a whole lot they can do about the long term debt. In the last quarter they retired $7B in debt but issued almost $11B thereby creating more debt for each quarter thus far than they retired in 2015. The increase in debt took advantage of the low interest rates but has to be deployed well to make sense. When compared to industry rival General Motors (NYSE: GM ), Ford's debt is even more concerning. GM reported having $15.4B cash on hand, short term debt of $17B and long term debt of just $40B. This puts GM at a competitive advantage going into the future should another recession hit. The rising debt and giant bonds reaching maturity so close together is a long term worry for a long term investor such as myself. Ford has been making good use of the debt, deploying it in short and long term projects to ensure future competitive advantages. Recently they committed just over $1B to retool their Kentucky truck plant to construct the redesigned 2017 Super Duty pickups that will feature an aluminum body. Sales of the aluminum F150 have been stellar as consumers realize the benefit of an aluminum body and the Superduty should be no different. Most notable is Ford's commitment of $4.5B to electric vehicle development . Ford hopes to make 40% of its vehicle lineup electric by 2020 bringing it in line with rising MPG requirements and taking advantage of a new market for the vehicles. With all the news and promise of success now and in the future the stock price has still dropped 7% from where it opened a year ago. Shareholders are justifiably frustrated and Ford has done little to comfort them. The most recent positive catalyst for the company was the revelation that they could be partnering with Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) to develop driverless cars . This would give Ford a very distinct advantage over basically every other automaker should the rumors be true and the joint venture remain exclusive. Unfortunately at this point we are unaware of the terms of the deal and I'm reminded of something a leader of mine once told me, "Documentation beats conversation." This does little to move the stock in a meaningful sustained direction, which is what the company truly needs. Taking a look at the Q3 report we have a much better idea of where Ford is going and what they could do with the dividend. They currently pay a quarterly dividend of $.15 which gives you a 4.19% yield. For those of us who place an emphasis on dividends this is a good one, the issue is Ford's recent history in paying it. Beginning in FY07 and stretching to 2011 Ford did not pay a dividend. In 2012 it was finally reinstated at $.05 a quarter and has risen steadily each year since. The last three raises have been $.025 each quarter. Capital expenditures have remained fairly consistent each quarter for the year at around $1.8B but the impressive metric is the free cash flow. In Q1 2015 Ford reported $613M in FCF, Q3 they reported a wonderful $4.6B. The dividend cost just $595M (~$2.4B annually) in Q3, with EPS coming in at $.48 the dividend was easily covered at 31.25%. What we see here is a rapidly growing free cash flow, a relatively cheap dividend for Ford to pay on their ~4B in shares, and lots of promise going into the future of continued earnings report successes. Based on sales figures for November and December the Q4 report should be outstanding. So what is Ford to do? They will likely raise the dividend by another $.025 each quarter, this will add about another $100M to the quarterly payout which is manageable even with current debt levels. With this raise the yield will be very close to 4.9% at current prices. Ford has been very careful in implementing and paying the dividend and they aren't unlikely to risk jeopardizing the company with a huge raise. Their yield is already competitive and a raise of $.10 a year is extremely positive for shareholders while still being conservative. We have to remember that even if Q4 knocks it out of the park that is still just one quarter and the circumstances will be hard to reproduce. Automobile sales are highly cyclical and constantly breaking sales records simply isn't practical. Just for fun I would like to entertain the idea that Ford will increase the dividend by $.035 a quarter, adding $140M to the quarterly cost and bringing annual cost to about $2.9B. At current market prices that will make the yield just over 5%. That magic 5% appeals to the instant gratification side of me as an investor. Unfortunately, as long term investors we have to look past that next quarterly payout and think about what this will do to the balance sheet. Having almost $3B in dividend costs isn't wise for Ford as competition increases and costs to manufacture vehicles rises. As time goes on pension costs are rising along with labor costs, and the cost to simply do business around the world is going up. The increasingly strong US Dollar is a macro headwind that all international companies are facing as well. A large raise in the dividend would also likely do very little to raise the share price, another concern for those who want to see their capital grow. As previously discussed Ford has a lot of cash and can't really address their long term debt immediately, so what can they do to create value for shareholders without adding to their long term debt and maybe even reduce it? A very aggressive share buyback is a solution. Ford has ~4 billion in shares outstanding, a remarkable number. In 2014 they authorized $1.8B in buybacks to help counter the dilution of shares as a bond came to maturity. This wiped about 116 million shares from the records leaving us at our current levels. If Ford would commit $5B they could wipe out ~344M shares at a price of $14.50/share. At the current $.60 annual dividend that would save Ford over $206M annually, raising the dividend to $.70 a year saves them over $240M. They could accomplish this by exercising quarterly buybacks utilizing free cash flow without adding debt and it would help counter share dilution from shares being issued as salary and other factors. If nothing else changes it would take Ford 20 years to break even and would be right before a $2B bond reaches maturity in 2043. Of course, at this point this is 100% speculation and was mostly for fun to run some numbers, but it is interesting nonetheless. At the very least a stock buyback would help to increase value for those shareholders who have watched the stock underperform in 2015 as sales and revenue has gone up. I believe at this point a dividend raise is inevitable and will be $.025 a quarter. Ford has been doing very well and we are seeing lots of progress on many fronts. Analysts are predicting $1.92 EPS for 2016, a full $.30 than where we are today, which will give Ford lots of working capital to remain competitive and relevant to the market. Regardless of what Ford decides to do about the dividend I am comfortable with my position and will be adding by years end. I wish all of you good luck and good health in the coming year and look forward to the discussion in the comments. If I have been mistaken on any figures please address that in the comments and I will submit a correction, I may be exceptionally good looking and remarkably talented but I am still human and I've made a mistake or two before.
