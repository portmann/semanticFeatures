Microsoft Is Cool Again - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha HoloLens shows that Microsoft is capable of building hit products. Microsoftâ€™s third quarter results show that the company is not in danger of secular decline. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) has a buzz around it that it hasn't had since Windows 95. Microsoft is cool again. Developers are dying to get their hands on HoloLens and program for it. Journalists are heaping praise while consumers are eager to try HoloLens out. Microsoft used to miss the great computing shifts. Although Internet Explorer was the world's most popular browser in the 2000's, Microsoft let Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) take a commanding lead of search and belatedly spent billions on Bing to catch up. In its attempt to crush Google, Microsoft missed the shift from desktop to mobile and let Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) become the world's most valuable company. Because it missed those big computing shifts, many feared that Microsoft was in danger of secular decline. Microsoft's cash cows, Windows and Office, were all dependent on desktop PC's, whose sales volumes decreased every year. With HoloLens, Microsoft is on the leading edge of tech again. HoloLens looks slick, like something from a science fiction movie. With Microsoft's universal app technology, HoloLens will have thousands of apps starting off, giving it a strong advantage over Oculus or Google Glass. Given that the platform game is all about winning developers in the early stages, Microsoft's app lead could give it a leading market share in a winner take all market. In HoloLens, Microsoft could have something that rivals the iPhone or the desktop. HoloLens also shows that Microsoft's $11 billion a year research and development is paying off. It used to be that Microsoft consumer products such as the Zune were chronically late to market and dead on arrival. Now Microsoft R&D is making unique, leading edge products such as Skype translator, Surface, and HoloLens. More productive R&D means higher revenue and margins in the future. Not surprisingly, many hedge funds and value investors own Microsoft shares. ValueAct Capital owns 74 million shares while Yacktman Asset Management owns almost 22 million shares. First Eagle Investment Management also owns 36 million shares. Although hedge funds have collectively not done well in the past few years, our research shows that the 15 most popular small-cap stocks among hedge funds have outperformed the market by nearly a percentage point per month between 1999 and 2012. We have been forward testing the performance of these stock picks since the end of August 2012. These stocks managed to return more than 132% over the ensuing 2.5 years and outperformed the S&P 500 Index by nearly 80 percentage points ( read the details here ). Microsoft's third quarter numbers show that the company is no longer in danger of secular decline. Although Microsoft's Q3 Windows and Office revenue both declined year over year, Microsoft's commercial cloud division grew 106% year over year and is now on a $6.3 billion run rate. Because of Microsoft's strong cloud numbers, Microsoft Q3 profits and revenues beat analyst expectations. The cloud is only going to be bigger. Microsoft plans to get $20 billion from the cloud by 2018, or 23% of its current $86 billion a year in revenue. Although Microsoft's forward PE of 17 is about the same as the S&P 500's forward PE, Microsoft shares are cheap. Given that Microsoft has $11 worth of cash per share, Microsoft trades at 13 forward PE ex cash. After a decade and half of slumber, Microsoft is returning to its 90's form. The company still dominates desktop PC's and corporate productivity software and now has a strong lead in the virtual reality sector too. Given Microsoft's successful cloud transition, the launch of Windows 10 in July, and HoloLen's potential, Microsoft's revenue and profits could continue to beat market expectations going forward. If Microsoft maintains its current momentum, Microsoft shares could easily trade for 17 forward PE ex cash, giving Microsoft shares a 30% upside.
