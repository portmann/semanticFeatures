Intel's Next Big Thing - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel is developing its own AR headset, although it powers Microsoft's HoloLens. Meanwhile, Microsoft is launching HoloLens for developers. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) is developing a wearable AR (augmented reality) headset. A person familiar with Intel's headset plans says Intel is collaborating with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) for its wearable headset initiative, according to The WSJ . The news came on the heels of another report , which said Microsoft will start shipping its MR (mixed reality) device, HoloLens, to developers on March 30. The PC may be dying, but the Wintel alliance could get a new lease on life with the advent of AR/MR headsets. Although AR and MR aren't the same, there are similarities. Both AR and MR devices create a mixed environment for the viewer by superimposing computer-generated images over real-world objects. Growth opportunities for both Intel and Microsoft? Why Microsoft's HoloLens Could Be A Huge Success? TechCrunch reported that Microsoft will sell HoloLens to developers in the US and Canada for $3,000 per unit. Microsoft will also introduce a few apps for HoloLens, such as Skype optimized for HoloLens and a few games in the initial phase. HoloLens is capable of delivering VR (virtual reality) by generating holographic images. It can then add the holographic images over the images taken from the physical world, which falls in the realm of AR. Therefore HoloLens is an MR device. HoloLens is different from Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google Glass, which is a pure AR device. Since HoloLens could be more appealing to users, it could see wider adoption than Google Glass. While Google Glass can just add text-based information on top of real-world objects, an MR device like HoloLens can provide a 360 degree 3D computing experience. This can even become the computing platform of the future, rendering your PCs, laptops or even smartphones obsolete. An MR device like HoloLens can superimpose 3D holographic images in the real-world scene. HoloLens will help users communicate and interact in new ways, involving real 3D environment (unlike 3D on a 2D surface like your PC). Users will be able to move back and forth around an object, which isn't possible using today's computing devices. You can experience Skype on the wall of your room (actually it's possible to do any computing work anywhere beyond the computer screen). Users can even navigate around the Earth inside their room wearing HoloLens. Microsoft's HoloLens will have a 32-bit CPU made by Intel as well as Microsoft's own custom-built HPU (holographic processing unit). The HPU will take care of developing real 3D imagery by creating the illusion of 3D in a user's brain (to learn more about this, click here ). Microsoft's Alex Kipman said: HoloLens has see-through holographic lenses that use an advanced optical projection system to generate multi-dimensional full-color holograms with very low latency so you can see holographic objects in your world. HoloLens will create a new revenue stream for Microsoft. Since the device has the potential to establish itself as a standalone computing platform, I believe Microsoft's revenue will rise significantly once HoloLens goes mainstream. The current version of HoloLens is powered by an Intel processor, as mentioned above. In addition, Intel will launch its own AR device, which of course will be powered by its own processor. Intel's 3D camera technology RealSense will be used in developing the AR headset. The question is why a processor company will develop and sell AR headsets? For Intel, creating devices is nothing new. Remember Intel's mega-launch of smart bracelet MICA at a New York Fashion Week? Further, a smart sports-bra powered by an Intel chip via its Curie module was unveiled in a NYFW a year later. All of these are part of Intel's marketing strategy. And the purpose of developing the AR headset is nothing different. Via developing the devices and subsequently launching them at major events, which influence people, Intel conveys an important message to device-makers. Intel wants to say something like this, "If we are inside, your device will succeed." The launch of HoloLens to developers powered by an Intel processor, however, has a different implication. Given HoloLens' potential to become a standalone computing platform, Intel's association with Microsoft signifies the reincarnation of the Wintel alliance. Reshaping the reality (via AR, VR or MR) and the Internet of Things are fundamentally different. However, they have one thing in common, which is developing robust tracking technologies led by sensors. Intel is investing heavily in the development of tracking technologies for creating an augmented as well as connected world. Take the example of its Curie module, mentioned above. It's a tiny piece of hardware aimed at powering a host of wearable and other consumer/industrial devices. Intel's revenues will grow by leaps and bounds when its hardware will power thousands of tomorrow's devices. The rebirth of Wintel could be the best advertisement for Intel, no additional marketing strategy would be necessary! When Microsoft launched its HoloLens program earlier in 2015, most people didn't take it seriously. However, with Microsoft inviting developers into the program, HoloLens is drawing serious attention of not only developers, but the media and general public as well. Intel's collaboration with Microsoft is an interesting development, which could be a win-win for both. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
