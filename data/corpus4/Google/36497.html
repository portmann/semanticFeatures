Microsoft: The Jagged Little Pill Of Free Windows Could Get Bigger But I Like It - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft will report its earnings today. I expect another drop in Windows licensing revenue. Slowing down the mighty assault of Googleâ€™s Android/Chrome OS will require Microsoft to eventually give away free Windows licenses on all forms of consumer devices. Like other PC sales-dependent firms, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) is likely to deliver earnings and revenue numbers lower than Estimize folks predict . Microsoft will report earnings after the bell and I believe the effect of the jagged little pill of free Windows OS licensing that Nadella swallowed last year, could again deliver lower Windows licensing revenue. IDC's report of continued drop in PC sales is partly why MSFT has a -8.58% YTD performance. Most investors are still worried about the big year-over-year decline in Devices and Consumer Licensing's revenue and gross margin numbers. The chart above is enough explanation that Devices and Consumer Licensing might also be feeling the heat from weaker Windows OEM licensing. Microsoft's April 2014 gift of free Windows OS to tablets and smartphone OEMs certainly aggravates the persistent problem of weakening PC sales. Unfortunately, I believe the jagged little pill of free Windows licensing will only grow bigger - beyond tablets and smartphones. Microsoft is backing Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) PC-on-a-Stick Windows/Linux computer product. The $149 Intel Compute Stick runs on Windows 8.1. But a clone of the Compute Stick only retails for $90 because the Chinese OEM is not using a licensed Windows 8.1 operating system. Fudzilla discussed this problem of Microsoft only giving free Windows OS to tablet manufacturers. The discrimination against HDMI PC sticks and mini PCs could eventually die once Microsoft realizes that other form factors of compute devices also deserve a free Windows 10 license. Intel is circumventing the pricey license of Windows OS and is offering an $89 version of its Compute Stick running on Ubuntu Linux. The PC revolution of energy-efficient thumbdrive-size portable Windows 8.1 machines from Intel and Beelink is an opportunity that Microsoft should not ignore. Microsoft could help Intel develop the Compute Stick as a means to increase the advertising eyeball population of Windows-only compute devices. Tablet sales are declining. Microsoft's desire to compete with Android says it could eventually include non-tablet computers in its free Windows licensing program. Intel's PC-on-a-Stick concept is a worthwhile alternative to Android-only TV dongles that turn ordinary LED TVs into instant Smart TVs. The problem with my 32-inch Android Smart TV is that I cannot run Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE ) Photoshop on it. The Intel Compute Stick (and clones of it) is a more useful productivity tool than tablets or smartphones. Enterprise IT managers still stubbornly holding on to their Windows XP machines could be enticed by cheap $90 Windows 10 HDMI PC sticks. The energy efficiency of HDMI PC sticks from Intel is great for budget-conscious business users. A $90 Windows 10 HDMI stick is only possible if Microsoft gives away free Windows licenses. The loss of licensing fees could be recovered through search and digital display advertising. Schools, individuals, and corporations who cannot afford a $200 Chromebook could find a $90 Windows 10 HDMI Stick as a cost-efficient upgrade solution to their current Windows XP or Windows 7 desktop computers. The reality now is that the PC market is no longer limited to just desktop and laptop configurations. Intel is making good money over its mini PC business. However, Microsoft's refusal to give free Windows licensing to OEMs that create mini computers has forced other manufacturers to use Linux or Android. Mini PC vendors are making the tiny PC form factor the saving grace in the troubled waters of declining PC sales. Microsoft can help nurture the PC-on-a-stick idea because low-power tiny computers could be the next growth driver for Wintel machines. Investors should prepare themselves for more quarters of lower Windows licensing sales. Microsoft will keep on swallowing the painful jagged little pill of free Windows licensing. It is a necessary evil that Nadella cannot avoid in his war against Google's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Android. The short-term pain is great because it could lead to long-term financial gain. Nadella is transforming Microsoft in to a mini-Google that has the willingness to lose sales from software licensing just to gain access to people's web browsing and online shopping habits. The mobile compute industry now is all about getting the most amount of users. The willingness of people to let Google or Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) track their web and mobile activities is why digital advertising is such a gold mine. Giving away free software, services, and operating systems is an effective bait to lock-in the billions of advertising-hungry people that are getting farmed with Google's hyper-targeted advertising. Microsoft, thanks to its massive presence in desktop computing, could also replicate the success of Google's fanatical focus on digital advertising. We must never forget that Microsoft rakes in billions of dollars from annual patent fees it charges to Android device manufacturers. Microsoft can weather the pain of both a price war against Android phones and the loss of revenue from consumer Windows licensing. AMD's (NASDAQ: AMD ) CEO, Dr. Lisa Su, hinted that Windows 10 will get commercial launching by end of July. The universal, cross-platform beauty of Windows 10 might encourage a lot of app developers to favor Windows 10 over Android. The more games and apps that populate the Windows mobile ecosystem, the more Android users could flock to the familiar comfort zone of Windows. Allowing users of Android phone users to also get free custom Windows 10 ROMs to replace the Android OS of their devices, is also a future tailwind for Microsoft's new freemium strategy . Stealing the advertising eyeballs of Android users is sweet revenge. If Microsoft continues to sell Windows 10 licenses instead of giving them away, more PC and mobile device OEMs could defect to Android or Chrome OS. The race-to-the-bottom pricing strategy of mini PC and smartphone vendors means Windows-friendly OEMs need a free operating system to keep their products competitive with sub-$100 Android phones, tablets, and HDMI PC Sticks . In spite of the pain of reduced Windows licensing revenue, I still rate MSFT as a Buy . Compared to its technology and industry peers, Microsoft delivers higher operating margins but lower P/E, P/S, and P/B ratios.
