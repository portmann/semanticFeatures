Samsung: Another Reason To Short Apple - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha The Samsung Galaxy S7 outpaces the iPhone on virtually every metric. The return of an SD Card, a water and dust proof case and 4GB RAM may attract even iPhone users long denied such features. Samsung's ( OTC:SSNLF ) S7 is a truly remarkable device with processing power, storage, camera and a battery that best the iPhone on virtually every metric. Seeking Alpha contributor Mark Hibben damns the Galaxy S7 with faint praise , but grudgingly admits its launch is likely to take a bite out of Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Q2 sales of its flagging iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. Hibben argues that the Galaxy S7 is not much better than its iPhone counterpart, but can point only to single-core CPU performance as an area where the iPhone leads. Software written for single-core processors is about as state-of-the-art as an Edsel, and the developer world is shifting resources to develop applications that capitalize on multi-core processors' distinct advantages, which provide users seamless multitasking and multithreading with less battery drag than programs written when single-core CPUs were the only ones in existence, at least in my opinion. With the most powerful applications processor yet to grace a smartphone and the return of a micro-SD card up to 200GB and water and dust resistance, the Galaxy S7 is a far more powerful and flexible device than any iPhone that ever came out of Cupertino. The inclusion of 4GB of RAM ensures smooth operation even when tasked with larger files and multiple applications. Samsung offers the Galaxy S7 at a lower price than its S6 predecessor. And for those who pre-order, Samsung is throwing in a virtual reality headset, normally priced at $100. Apple Pay was for a period of time the salvation of the iOS ecosystem if you believed the hype. PYMTS estimated that 3.6 million iPhone users actually used the service in the summer of 2015. Samsung Pay was released subsequent to the Apple Pay launch and has reportedly passed 5 million users. The race goes to the swift and it seems to me that the vastly larger installed base of Samsung smartphones will result in Samsung having a significantly greater impact on mobile payments than Apple. Investors should pay attention to the success or failure of the Galaxy S7. I think it will attract a lot of iPhone users who are fed up with short battery lives, inadequate storage options and a lagging ecosystem. In terms of applications support, Google Play is projected to expand at four times the rate of Apple's App Store. If it does, the Apple ecosystem will become the Apple "ego system" with only diehard Apple fans clinging to the vain hope that Apple's once breathtaking growth will resume as the Cupertino labs come up with the "next best thing." The sad fact for Apple investors is that the "next best thing" probably has a Samsung logo on it. The success of the Galaxy S7 could be a coffin nail in the Apple story with another brokerage firm downgrading the outlook for iPhone, based on the latest supplier estimates, as SMBC Nikko Securities calls for current year iPhone sales of 190 million, down from 220 million. A reduction of 30 million iPhones would take about $20 billion out of revenues and perhaps as much as $1 per share out of earnings.
