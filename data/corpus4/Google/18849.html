Going Long On Amazon's AWS Glacier - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Amazon appears to be a poor investment. Google’s Nearline is supposedly better than Amazon’s Glacier. Many investors view Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ) as problematic, like an eight-ton statue of your mother-in-law on the front lawn: What the heck are you going to do with it? On the one hand, Bezos and company have a cash flow problem, along with no profits and nominal growth. And they are adding debt. On the other hand, Amazon's revenues are up 20% and the company's assets continue to increase in leaps and bounds. What investors are forgetting is that Amazon, unlike Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), is not dependent on advertising for revenue. Amazon is involved in retailing its own products and the products of other companies. And it is part of the movie business. And most importantly, Amazon is the biggest and the best at archival storage, more commonly referred to as "the cloud." The term "the cloud" simply refers digital data stored on multiple servers that are owned and operated by the host company, such as Google or Amazon. For big companies with lots of data the primary advantage to using "the cloud" is that it can be categorized as an operating expense and not a capital expense. But wait a minute! Didn't Google just announce its super-duper cloud storage, called Nearline ? And isn't it supposed to sink Amazon's Glacier , the name of Amazon Web Services' cloud storage? Google made it sound like Nearline's availability lag-time was only 2 to 5 seconds, which, if true, is phenomenal. But what Google failed to explicate was the so-called "latency aspect." For every TB stored on Nearline, Google only allows retrieval at the rate of 4MB per second. So if a company stored 2 TB of data on Nearline, their retrieval rate would be 8MB per second. 3 TB equates to retrieval at 12MB per second, and 4TB yields a 16MB rate. That sounds just dandy. But wait. In real-time application it's not so hot. If my company has 1TB of information stored on Nearline, my download will begin in 2 to 5 seconds, just as advertised. But the download won't be finished until 3 days and one hour later. Whereas if my company had the same data stored on Amazon's Glacier, the download time would be 3 to 5 hours. Moreover, I can retrieve up to 5% of my data stored on Glacier for free. Google's Nearline costs me one cent per GB, along with one cent per month for storage, per GB. In other words, Nearline picks my pocket both coming and going. The way Glacier is set up, if I or my customers are careful, we can remain within the parameters of 'free' retrieval. And if we're not careful, we don't have to pay a toll both ways. The final insult offered by Nearline is that if I overwrite or change my data, then Nearline considers this an early deletion and hits me with an additional fee. That means Nearline is similar to Verizon (NYSE: VZ ), AT&T (NYSE: T ) and all the other phone carrier providers. If I opt out early, I have to pay a big fat fee. All I wanted to do was overwrite some data. I wasn't trying to cancel my contract. Thus upon closer examination, it's clear that Google's Nearline is not better than Amazon's Glacier. In fact, Glacier is faster and cheaper than Nealine. Google simply had a slicker marketing campaign. And once companies begin to figure this out, Amazon will be in the cat-bird seat when it comes to cloud storage, especially since Amazon just purchased 2lemetry, a company that creates IoT (Internet of Things) solutions involving the interconnection of embedded devices. Eventually, IoT has the potential of allowing context-aware automation. In other words, this is heady stuff. By purchasing 2lemetry , Bezos is positioning Amazon Web Services as the foremost business cloud storage; one that offers analytics, storage and connectivity under one roof. What does this mean for Amazon's stock? IoT is projected to become a $14 trillion industry by the year 2020.
