Microsoft: Sacrificing Android Patents Licensing In Favor Of Platform-Agnostic Growth - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft has agreed to settle out of court all patent infringement suits against Motorola/Google. Android OEMs, which previously signed licensing deals with Microsoft, may also quit paying. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) negotiated a mutual dismissal of all patent infringement suits involving Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ). At first glance, this move might be seen as an act of surrender. The original patent infringement suit was filed by Microsoft against Motorola (NYSE: MSI ) over its Android devices in October 2010 . Motorola, once a subsidiary of Google, allegedly violated nine patents of Microsoft. The negotiated settlement with Google now obviously endangers the lucrative multi-billion patent licensing business of Microsoft. There are more than a dozen of Android device manufacturers that already agreed to pay for annual licensing fees. Below is a partial list of Android OEMs that are paying annual licensing fees to Microsoft. The suit against Motorola five years ago was obviously a fear factor that intimidated Android OEMs to just pay instead of facing Microsoft's litigation lawyers. (Source: Alcaraz Research/Foss Patents) The lawyers are not the only ones who are going to lose money on this settlement with Google. For the near term, Microsoft will also suffer financially from this deal. If Google, owner of the Android OS, is now forever immune from paying Android licensing fees, there's nothing preventing Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ), HTC, Acer, ZTE, and other firms from asking a judge to dismiss any licensing agreement they previously signed with Microsoft. They could argue that Microsoft's settlement with Google is indicative that its patents covering Android devices aren't worth paying for. Samsung, the biggest vendor of Android devices, pays Microsoft more than $1 billion per year just for patent licensing fees. Microsoft's capitulation against Motorola Mobility/Google is a clear admission that it doesn't really have the right to force companies to pay licensing fees. I'm not a lawyer, but as far as I know, there is no such thing as selective patent licensing. I therefore expect Microsoft to quickly lose its $2 billion/year of easy money from Android-related licensing fees. The settlement with Google has an easy explanation. This scenario was already on the horizon five months ago. Digitimes' April report revealed that Microsoft was offering patent licensing fee discounts to Android OEMs. Microsoft dangled lower licensing fees if OEMs pre-install Bing, Skype, OneNote, Office 365, and OneDrive mobile apps on Android devices they sell. I opine that Nadella's platform-agnostic strategy to bring Microsoft apps/cloud services in all devices is now more important than the $2 billion/year patent licensing revenue. He believes sacrificing the easy money from patent licensing is necessary to inspire more Android OEMs to pre-install Microsoft mobile apps and services. The Android OS ecosystem is too huge that manufacturers are already too dependent on it. The upcoming commercial launch of the Windows 10 Mobile OS is not going to make any company quit its Android-only business. Nadella is obviously not waiting anymore for Android OEMs to create Windows 10 phones. He just wants to infect their Android devices with a dose of Microsoft apps. It might be his original intention all along to eventually eliminate all Android licensing fees just to gain the support of OEMs. Paying zero Android licensing fee is certainly a great incentive for OEMs to pre-install Bing or Skype. It is no secret that many Android manufacturers resent the added cost from paying licensing fees to Microsoft. The Android phone/tablet business is a race-to-the-bottom cut-throat industry. Saving $4 or $5 on each product by not paying patent fees to Microsoft should help Samsung and ZTE make money on their sub-$100 phones. I still rate MSFT as a Buy. Microsoft is simply imitating Google in giving away free software and patents in exchange for people's personal data. The more people that use Microsoft's freemium mobile apps, the better chance there is that Microsoft could catch up with Google's huge lead in digital advertising. The more mobile users that get data-mined through Bing, Skype, and Office 365, the faster it is that Microsoft could build its database of personal information. Google's success in advertising is due to its ruthless, all-access approach to gathering personal information. Microsoft needs to also offer an all-intrusive access to personal data so that advertisers would finally consider Bing Ads as an alternative to Google's hyper-targeted ads. Nadella's obvious sacrifice of the Android licensing fees is akin to a fearless chess grandmaster sacrificing a Queen to try and gain long-term positional advantage. There's obviously more billions to be made from ultra-personalized mobile advertising than from extorting patent licensing fees.
