Ad Blocking On Safari Could Lead To Apple Losing Billions In Easy Money - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Implementing ad blocking on mobile devices is difficult since it causes battery drain and CPU/RAM hogging. Apple, which gets $1 billion/year from using Google as the default search engine in mobile Safari, also could get hurt by ad-blocking browser extensions. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) will reportedly release iOS 9 next month . However, it's not an immediate threat to advertising-dependent firms like Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ). Apple did not make any official announcement that iOS 9 will come with the best method for third-party developers to create ad-blocking browser extensions for Safari. What iOS 9 is promising to deliver is a "Content Blocking" extension API (Application Programming Interface) that uses JavaScript and CSS to block content before a page is loaded on Safari. This method is deemed inferior by developers of ad blocker extensions like AdBlock Plus. The experts at WebKit says the JavaScript-based content blocking extensions cause serious drain on battery and also slow down loading of web pages. It's therefore unlikely that top ad-block developers will use iOS 9's content blocking API because of the battery drain issue and performance throttling. The current implementation of ad block extensions is already a CPU/RAM hog on desktop PC browsers. Using Apple's JavaScript-based content blocking extensions on phones with weaker CPU, lesser RAM and battery-dependent phones would be a worst experience. The performance/battery issue is why ad blocking is still unpopular among mobile users. There are dozens of standalone ad-blocking apps, browsers and browser extensions available on Google Play and iTunes, and yet very few people use them. In spite of the growing number of people using ad blockers on desktop PCs, people still prefer not to use ad blockers on their iOS/Android devices. Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE ) and PagePair's Q2 2015 report shows a steady growth in number of ad-blockers. However, PageFair and Adobe also state that mobile only contributes 1.6% to ad-blocked traffic. This is in spite of the fact that mobile devices already accounts for 38% of all global web traffic. Aside from the performance/battery issue, another compelling reason why Apple will not be actively implementing ad-blocking on iO9 devices is that Tim Cook likes the estimated $1 billion/annual payment from Google. Since 2009, Apple is estimated to be getting $2-to-$3.50 per iOS device from Google as a Traffic Acquisition Cost (NYSE: TAC ) fee to make Google the default search engine on mobile Safari. The geniuses at Apple might eventually come up with a better ad-blocking extension API that would address the battery drain/performance of ad blockers. However, the easy/no-cost, $1 billion/year from helping Google is a strong incentive for Apple to not propagate ad blockers. There's no money to be made on Apple letting free-to-use ad-blocking extensions on Safari. I also seriously doubt that approving third-party browser extensions would lead to significant improvement in iPhone/iPad sales. The Safari/Google search engine deal is set to expire this year. The noise over content blocking extensions on iOS 9 might just be a scare tactic of Apple to motivate Google to pay a higher TAC fee. A successful persuasion of Google to pay $5-plus per unit TAC fee is justified. As a long on AAPL, I'm cheering for Tim Cook to strong-arm Google to share more of the money from Safari search advertising. Apple devices contributed to 75% of Google's estimated $11.8 billion revenue from mobile ads last year. Half of that amount is subject to the Safari deal (the other half is from app-install ads). Google therefore grossed $4.425 billion on search engine ads on iOS devices but it only probably paid just $1 billion in TAC fees to Apple last year. Mobile is the future of search advertising. It is therefore more preferable for Apple to negotiate a new 40/60 or 50/50 revenue sharing agreement. The current per unit traffic acquisition cost deal with Google is not fair to AAPL investors. Google remains the global leader in mobile search, with over 90% of mobile search. It makes for Apple to retain its partnership with Google. Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL.
