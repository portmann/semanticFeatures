After Denying Bias, Facebook Changes Policies That Produce Anti-Conservative Bias | Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! Congressman Brady was smiling, waving, and making his escape to a  waiting vehicle.  One of our children shouted, "Dad!  He's getting away!"  This past Thursday marked the one-year anniversary of the US stock marketâ€™s death when stocks saw their last high.

Submitted by Dan Calabrese via CanadaFreePress.com, That’s pretty much what Facebook said late Monday by changing the policies it insisted did not need to be changed in order to stop the suppression of news stories that appear favorable to conservatives in its Trending Topics section. Facebook Inc (FB.O) said on Monday that it had changed some of the procedures for its “Trending Topics” section after a news report alleging it suppressed conservative news prompted a U.S. Congressional demand for more transparency. The company said an internal probe showed no evidence of political bias in the selection of news stories for Trending Topics, a feature that is separate from the main “news feed” where most Facebook users get their news. But the world’s largest social network said in a blogpost that it was introducing several changes, including elimination of a top-ten list of approved websites, more training and clearer guidelines to help human editors avoid ideological or political bias, and more robust review procedures. Earlier this month, a former Facebook contractor had accused the company’s editors of deliberately suppressing conservative news. The allegations were reported by technology news website Gizmodo, which did not identify the ex-contractor. The report led Republican Sen. John Thune to write a letter demanding that the company explain how it selects news articles for its Trending Topics list. Based on the various stories I read, it sounded like the key here was the list of approved web sites. Editors were told that if they found something on a conservative site like this one, they had to affirm it on a “trustworthy” site like, er, the New York Times. So it’s not as if they were told, “Don’t post stories about Fast and Furious or the IRS scandal!” They were told to make sure the New York Times and other MSM sites were also covering them. And since we all know the MSM likes to ignore stories that are trending on conservative media, voila! De facto bias. But if the Gizmodo story was accurate, Facebook editors were at least in some instances putting their fingers on the scales by promoting pro-left movements like Black Lives Matter. If they’re not doing “more training” to stop that, I suspect that probably means they’re changing earlier training that very much encouraged it. By the way, I remain troubled by the fact that the U.S. Senate got involved with this, and I hope that they drop it now that Facebook is changing their policies. As much as I didn’t like Facebook’s bias, which was impossible not to notice, it’s a private company (not privately held but operating in the private sector) and they can do whatever they want. Is the Senate going to haul Arianna Huffington before an investigative committee for making Huffington Post both liberal and completely inane? If the Democrats take back the Senate this year, will Harry Reid be issuing subpoenas to Herman, Rob and me? (Actually, I guarantee we would make that entertaining.) That said, it does matter - a lot - when the news media tilts the scales in favor of the left in its news coverage, and I’m glad Facebook is at least making a show of changing its procedures. We’ll see if it actually makes a difference. Far too many people rely on Facebook’s Trending Topics section for their news, and they never fail to find out when a celebrity has a nipple slip or World Turtle Day arrives. It would be nice if they also knew the effects of big government and the insane agenda of the secular left.

Tue, 05/24/2016 - 12:43 | 7600004 KnuckleDragger-X It's not evil if WE do it. I'm pretty sure that Zuck is a secret honkie clone of Obozo, so it's kind of surprising that he let them move out before he started bulldozing the neighborhood......

They are in the business of selling ads to people who use the product. They are not in the business of soothsaying.   If they can make the most money by pimping out stories of how many pimples are on Kim Kardashian's coochie, why not just keep doing that? There is no freedom of speech on facebook.  It is a private entity.  Let them do the what the fuck they want. Why are people bitching about the bias of facebook?  Let them be who they want to be. JUST DON"T FUCKING USE IT. As if this is the make or break issue for facebook. You sign away rights to any and all shit you post and they can snoop through all your shit and market that to whoever they want. Tue, 05/24/2016 - 12:44 | 7600009 lunaticfringe Zuck is the typical new age pussy that this country is producing. Steal someone's idea and parade around like you've accomplished something. The brothers should have beat his spoiled ass.

Tue, 05/24/2016 - 12:46 | 7600032 KnuckleDragger-X Socialist progressive sounds sooo much better than hard line Marxist. They don't have the time or patience to wait a generation which will be their downfall. At least out here in the god forsaken wilderness of flyover country. The true blue states however, are going to get their wish, hard...and soon.......

Like screwing your sister ya know unless she's really hot.  I may need a therapist.  I have an account so I can have a facebook page for my business (err, weekend beer fund) LLC. Generated 1 single sale from it, so now I don't even bother to update the page. Found a few other places to advertise for free and got more business that way. Tue, 05/24/2016 - 12:44 | 7600016 quadraspleen The problem with Fuckbook is that it's become so ingrained in the way corporations ream us and businesses target us, that it's hard not to be involved if you sell anything or produce anything you want other people to see. Like us on Facebook has become a modern meme you can't escape from if you want to promote anything. I voted the bottom, no seriously I don't use it, but I actually do have a Fuckbook page, as, if I want to promote my musical endeavours (a side bet from my day job) the best (only?) way to get people to look at it is via fucking Fuckbook or Twatter. To do it on Fuckbook you have to have a personal page. What the fuck, facecunt? WHY? You can't just create a band/artist page. They are total cunts. Then, as soon as people you know see you "have a page" they all start hassling you to fucking "friend" them. so, no, I don't really look at it now, as I'm a miserable old fuck who doesn't care what you had for lunch, nor where you went on holiday, or how much your fucking house has just been valued at. In fact, I'd like to send a few of you out late at night on Dartmoor and E&E your arses with some dogs Tue, 05/24/2016 - 13:10 | 7600146 Allen_H Tell me about it, I went to speak to somebody about work and everytime they would stop taking and say: You got Facefuck? Errr NO! I do not agree with spying. Then continued to talk, and: Do you have TwaTter? Errr NO! It has the same issues. Then I had to say that I have NO social profiles. I was not asked again about any social sites. Tue, 05/24/2016 - 12:46 | 7600019 The Wizard At least you are honest. I would venture to guess most people on ZH use facebook. Send them a message, STOP USING FACEBOOK. Tue, 05/24/2016 - 12:51 | 7600038 buzzsaw99 i seriously doubt it. zhers might lie about how much gold they have or how fat they are but we are seriously antisocial and anti corporate and especially anti facefuck. besides why lie on an anonymous poll? Tue, 05/24/2016 - 13:07 | 7600138 pods Reason enough right there for me to stay far far away. I only have time in life to do a certain amount of things. Facebook would be one more thing keeping me from accomplishing those tasks, even if said task is to scratch my nuts and forget about life for an hour. Tue, 05/24/2016 - 13:06 | 7600124 Guru1294 I simply use it as a conversational tool, along with whatsapp. A nice easy way to share your school work with others no? other than that its a big waste of time and the public that post comments on conservative stories are incredibly dumb, very few ZH like crowd on fb Tue, 05/24/2016 - 13:14 | 7600162 Umh Started to establish a Facebook account years ago. After browsing through the terms and conditions I decided that I would have to avoid it like the clap.

Tue, 05/24/2016 - 13:01 | 7600099 scintillator9 Much like looking around in any restaurant, or social gathering. People are literally across from each other, yet will text to each other instead of talking. Tue, 05/24/2016 - 12:48 | 7600040 TradingIsLifeBrah I don't believe any of this type of stuff would happen on Facebook.  I mean come on, we have Obama in office with the most transparent administration ever, you know how close Facebook is with the government so why would Facebook be anything but transparent as well.  Right? Tue, 05/24/2016 - 12:50 | 7600049 SMC Tue, 05/24/2016 - 12:52 | 7600057 brooklinite8 This is equivalent to a bank rigging a libor. Why not throw some fines on Zuck book. He has got lots of it. I think the .gov should look into fining the .net folks. Tue, 05/24/2016 - 12:55 | 7600066 maxamus Well, maybe they ignore articles but at least they aren't like ZeroHedge which will INTENENTIONALLY post flat out lies and make things up. How is that 8 year short working for you now ZH?  Just think, if the DOW drops over 10,000 points you can finally say "I TOLD YOU SO".   Actually, 11,000, 10k would just get you to break even.....  Tue, 05/24/2016 - 12:57 | 7600077 rudyspeaks O Facebook is biased! Boo-effing-noo! Meanwhile 95% of the mass media is owned by 4 Right-wing families and the world's biggest weapons-maker. In the run-up to the Iraq war-crime they presented youw/4 right-wing liars for every 1 person trying to tell you the truth. They constantly feed you imperialist, .01%er nonsense (notice how fast they stopped coverage of the Ukrainian crash of a Malaysian airliner when the "bash-Russia" approach started falling apart?), "disappear" inconvenient stories (Bernie WHO?), generally manipulate you to accept the Ruling Class Narrative. And, against this background, you're worried about "Facebook trending"...? Tue, 05/24/2016 - 12:59 | 7600093 the.ghost.of.22wmr It pains, but I must agree 100% with your comment.   The only 'conservative' aspect of the modern-day conservative, is 'CON'... It would be against the laws of Moloch for a died-in-the-woll Trotsky-ite to change his viewpoint on Liberty.   Like trying to mix oil & water.
