The total deal size is $26.2 billion and according to the press release, MSFT will finance the transaction primarily through the issuance of new debt. Indicatively, almost exactly one year ago, LNKD was trading at $300. Microsoft, which will pay a $725 million termination fee if the deal does not go through, warns that the deal will only become accretive in 2019. This means many synergies are coming for the tech company. Microsoft and LinkedIn Corporation on Monday announced they have entered into a definitive agreement under which Microsoft will acquire LinkedIn for $196 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at $26.2 billion, inclusive of LinkedInâ€™s net cash. LinkedIn will retain its distinct brand, culture and independence. Jeff Weiner will remain CEO of LinkedIn, reporting to Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft. Reid Hoffman, chairman of the board, co-founder and controlling shareholder of LinkedIn, and Weiner both fully support this transaction. The transaction is expected to close this calendar year. Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT) and LinkedIn Corporation (NYSE: LNKD) on Monday announced they have entered into a definitive agreement under which Microsoft will acquire LinkedIn for $196 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at $26.2 billion, inclusive of LinkedInâ€™s net cash. LinkedIn will retain its distinct brand, culture and independence. Jeff Weiner will remain CEO of LinkedIn, reporting to Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft. Reid Hoffman, chairman of the board, co-founder and controlling shareholder of LinkedIn, and Weiner both fully support this transaction. The transaction is expected to close this calendar year. LinkedIn is the worldâ€™s largest and most valuable professional network and continues to build a strong and growing business. Over the past year, the company has launched a new version of its mobile app that has led to increased member engagement; enhanced the LinkedIn newsfeed to deliver better business insights; acquired a leading online learning platform called Lynda.com to enter a new market; and rolled out a new version of its Recruiter product to its enterprise customers. These innovations have resulted in increased membership, engagement and financial results, specifically: 19 percent growth year over year (YOY) to more than 433 million members worldwide 9 percent growth YOY to more than 105 million unique visiting members per month 49 percent growth YOY to 60 percent mobile usage 34 percent growth YOY to more than 45 billion quarterly member page views â€œThe LinkedIn team has grown a fantastic business centered on connecting the worldâ€™s professionals,â€? Nadella said. â€œTogether we can accelerate the growth of LinkedIn, as well as Microsoft Office 365 and Dynamics as we seek to empower every person and organization on the planet.â€? â€œJust as we have changed the way the world connects to opportunity, this relationship with Microsoft, and the combination of their cloud and LinkedInâ€™s network, now gives us a chance to also change the way the world works,â€? Weiner said. â€œFor the last 13 years, weâ€™ve been uniquely positioned to connect professionals to make them more productive and successful, and Iâ€™m looking forward to leading our team through the next chapter of our story.â€? The transaction has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both LinkedIn and Microsoft. The deal is expected to close this calendar year and is subject to approval by LinkedInâ€™s shareholders, the satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. â€œToday is a re-founding moment for LinkedIn. I see incredible opportunity for our members and customers and look forward to supporting this new and combined business,â€? said Hoffman. â€œI fully support this transaction and the Boardâ€™s decision to pursue it, and will vote my shares in accordance with their recommendation on it.â€? Microsoft will finance the transaction primarily through the issuance of new indebtedness. Upon closing, Microsoft expects LinkedInâ€™s financials to be reported as part of Microsoftâ€™s Productivity and Business Processes segment. Microsoft expects the acquisition to have minimal dilution of ~1 percent to non-GAAP earnings per share for the remainder of fiscal year 2017 post-closing and for fiscal year 2018 based on the expected close date, and become accretive to Microsoftâ€™s non-GAAP earnings per share in Microsoftâ€™s fiscal year 2019 or less than two years post-closing. Non-GAAP includes stock-based compensation expense consistent with Microsoftâ€™s reporting practice, and excludes expected impact of purchase accounting adjustments as well as integration and transaction-related expenses. In addition, Microsoft also reiterated its intention to complete its existing $40 billion share repurchase authorization by Dec. 31, 2016, the same timeframe as previously committed. Microsoft and LinkedIn will host a joint conference call with investors on June 13, 2016, at 8:45 a.m. Pacific Time/11:45 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss this transaction. The call will be available via webcast at https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor and will be hosted by Nadella and Weiner, as well as Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood and Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith. The presentation for the call is available on the Microsoft News Center. Morgan Stanley is acting as exclusive financial advisor to Microsoft, and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP is acting as legal advisor to Microsoft. Qatalyst Partners and Allen & Company LLC are acting as financial advisors to LinkedIn, while Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, Professional Corporation, is acting as legal advisor. Other social media stocks, including TWTR, FB and YELP all jump in sympathy on the news. The acquisition takes the LNKD price back to that February earnings announcement when LinkedIn's stock price plunged over concerns its growth had sharply slowed. In agreeing to the MSFT deal, LNKD implicity admits that all those concerns were founded as it would not agreed to this deal, and its 50% premium if it expected a return to growth rates which the market was priced in when LNKD was trading at $292 last year. MSFT is halted although many will wonder just how concerned about its own growth is the tech giant if it has to resort to such a dramatic pivot into social media. philipat buzzsaw99 Jun 13, 2016 8:44 AM One has to wonder how MSFT can add any incremental value to this  (Already fading) asset, especially after paying a 50% premium? Just  askin.... MillionDollarBonus_ philipat Jun 13, 2016 8:52 AM There is truly an industrial revolution occurring in the tech industry with titans like Facebook, Linkedin and Netflix soaring past all expectations. Investors in this sector are reaping obscene profits, while others worry about a potential 'market crash'. Technology is always a good investment, because no matter the state of the economy, technology is always transforming and adapting to serve peoples' needs. People who shun this sector simply don't understand the internet and social media revolution, and in my opinion they need to with get with it, or get out of the way.

Looney UncleChopChop Jun 13, 2016 8:59 AM MillionDollarBonus_ MillionDollarBonus_ Jun 13, 2016 9:00 AM The tech industry is also primarily serving Millenials who don't fit into tradition employment roles, by providing them with job opportunities that don't require excessive manual labor or social interaction. Millenials also 'get' the tech revolution, and many are keen to have cool tech companies in their portfolios, rather than morally questionable coal and mining companies for example.   Big Corked Boots philipat Jun 13, 2016 8:47 AM AlaricBalth philipat Jun 13, 2016 8:48 AM LinkedIn only has a 1% subscriber rate, and it has been declining YOY. Only 25% of free users go on LinkedIn more than once a month. buzzsaw99 AlaricBalth Jun 13, 2016 8:54 AM the only invites i ever get are from people whom i don't even like and who just want to use me in a one sided exploitation. fuck lnkd, fuck fb. TradingIsLifeBrah AlaricBalth Jun 13, 2016 8:58 AM I figured TWTR would be the social media acquisition to make headlines.  I guess Twitter is going Yahoo style and refused a buyout and a few years later they will be looking for a fraction of what they could get today.

Come to think of it, what was the last good decision Microsoft made? tarsubil Ink Pusher Jun 13, 2016 9:01 AM What if he bought LNKD before this announcement in dummy accounts? Gets to sell that stock to his own company at a premium. It would be a great way of cashing out for an oligarch. TradingIsLifeBrah Jun 13, 2016 8:47 AM Microsoft did a great job of reviving Nokia with its acquisition so I expect a similar result for LinkedIn.  Bullish! Does LinkedIn even do anything useful? Or do they just send me spam which mentions, in the subject line, the names of people I sort of know. Kirk2NCC1701 Seasmoke Jun 13, 2016 8:58 AM Also, not to be overlooked, is its importance to the Deep State: between FB and LinkedIn, it enables them to look at ALL your relationships, via the "6 Degree of Separation" model. This gets compounded, when you plug in an AI into the system, for Pre-Crime possibilities. Only the crimes that further a political agenda will be permitted. the.ghost.of.22wmr Jun 13, 2016 8:56 AM A man's life in these parts often depends on a mere scrap of information. Yet another information-grabbing user-generated social network is bought for billions (billions more than it's ever going to be worth).
