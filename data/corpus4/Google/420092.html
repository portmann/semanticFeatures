Verizon's Content Play: Controlling The Supply Chain For Mobile Video - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha What are Verizon's plans around content, and why is it acquiring at this pace? Identifying the underlying motives behind the company's content play is important for investors looking to see into its long-term future. The environment is ripe for Verizon to start capitalizing on non-core operations since it will give the company a foot in the doorway of a high-growth industry. The acquisition of AOL by Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) will not only put the company in control over a huge volume of video and original content, but more importantly, it will also allow it to participate in the supply chain portion of the mobile video phenomenon that is sweeping across the world. That's where the ad revenue opportunities lie, and AOL's programmatic advertising technology is the vehicle to get VZ there. The real objective - and this is not something that's been discussed at length - is its control over a portion of the supply chain responsible for getting content streamed to mobile devices. As a wireless carrier, it makes sense to want to be a part of that because it not only helps enlarge data volumes over its networks, but also gives it a way to lock in subscribers through various bundle plans that include streaming video as a core offering. Let's see how it's made its moves in the world of content, and how those moves make Verizon's stock more attractive than ever. ** TechCrunch , Verizon Press Release Verizon isn't new to acquiring content-related companies and their technology. It started in 2013 with its acquisition of the content delivery network operator EdgeCast Networks. At an estimated $400 million in revenues from this segment in 2015, it's clear that Verizon didn't necessarily acquire the company for top-line growth. What VZ wanted is the CDN platform and its ability to move video content. Its next move was to buy Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) media assets, which include cloud-based content and services around INTC's OnCue Cloud TV platform. Again, this purchase was not about the content itself, but the platform that would give VZ enhanced video delivery capabilities over the cloud. In the case of AOL, Verizon gets two benefits - high-quality original content with a captive audience of nearly 396.4 million people every month, and the technology to provide highly targeted audiences for advertisers. Essentially, AOL's content-based ad-targeting serves digital advertisements based on the type of content that the user regularly reads. To put it in perspective, Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) AdWords targets its audience based on the sites they visit, their general interests and so on. In contrast, content-centric advertising helps reach more relevant customers per advertising dollar because the advertiser already knows the type of content that audience is consuming on a regular basis. The end result is higher costs per click for these ads because they target specific niches that are more likely to click on the ad and sign up or purchase. By slowly beefing up its content portfolio and delivery networks, Verizon is essentially doing three things. The first is to exploit the steady stream of revenues from owning high-value content; the second is to own assets for creating and delivering that content - and, in the process, benefit from advertising revenues - the third is to set the stage for its own streaming video service, Go90. Admittedly, the service hasn't seen the kind of success that Verizon was expecting, but the addition of AOL's content gives VZ the breathing space it needs to nurture its new venture with DreamWorks Animation (NASDAQ: DWA ) and Hearst via AwesomenessTV. The new service will be merged with Go90 and is expected to start airing at the end of 2016. The significance of this service comes into focus when you consider certain statistics around the growth of mobile video content. From an investor's point of view, this is the right mix: diversification into a high-growth industry that gives Verizon more control over content, and additional revenue streams such as video advertising and content-based advertising. In addition, this play will also generate more traffic over VZ's own wireless networks - and more data means more revenue, obviously. So while I think the content itself is a big piece of this diversification puzzle, it is the volume and delivery of that content that holds the most promise for Verizon. My take on the stock is that a P/E ratio in the range of 11 makes it a little expensive, but not over the top. Besides, a long-term holding can give you the benefit of its current 4.5% dividend yield that has been more or less consistent over the past several years. Despite the fact that the Verizon's acquisition of Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) is still only an "expression of interest" by the former, it may well have played a trump card this Monday past with its tentative labor agreement with the Communications Workers of America, which could see 40,000 Verizon employees going back to their nine-to-fives as early as Wednesday this week. The move doesn't affect VZ's possible bid for Yahoo in any tangible way, but it does make a statement about its ability to resolve burning matters of the human resource kind. With an expected 10,000 layoffs at Yahoo yielding a savings of $2 billion, it may well have to make that 40% cut in the workforce if it does proceed with the asset purchase. If such an acquisition does come to fruition this year or even in the first half of 2017, Verizon will have acquired half a billion visitors a month and two proprietary advertising network technologies within the span of two years. Estimates put the bid range between $4 billion and $8 billion for Yahoo's core assets, and that's around what Verizon paid for AOL. Again, the intent would primarily be, in my opinion, in Yahoo's advertising network via the content it serves to over 150 million unique monthly visitors. Like AOL, Yahoo has its own ad algorithms, and this - along with a ready-made audience - is what Verizon would be after. Admittedly, Verizon's hands-off approach with acquired companies may not work well with Yahoo, but it already has AOL CEO Tim Armstrong to take control if the deal goes through; he'd be the natural choice for VZ.
