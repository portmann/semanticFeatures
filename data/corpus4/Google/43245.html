Wed, 04/29/2015 - 10:51 | 6042728 SethDealer Wed, 04/29/2015 - 10:55 | 6042738 pods Yahoo is the perfect example what the internet has become. An ADD paradise.  You pull up Yahoo to seach something and 6 hours later after being dazzled by their 6248 separate things on the splash page and you remember what you actually wanted to do. It's like the Vegas of websites.  Full of retards too. I used to look at the Yahoo comments when I was feeling bad about myself.  It's like the online equivalent of walking through a Walmart.

And Yahoo comments are so predictable and canned.  At least on ZH you find some crazy assed ones.  Yahoo is like walking down the dented can isle at Aldi.
