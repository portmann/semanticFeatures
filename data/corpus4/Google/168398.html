Mr. Market Errs: Apple Is Unlikely To Be Stopped In Its Rise To Further Heights - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple's Wednesday event presented the new iPhone version, which presents attractive upgrade features. Before the event, financial media raised the bar so high that a stock market failure for AAPL was not unlikely, as is discussed below. In contrast, facts suggest that the iPhone (and therefore Apple) may in fact be on the verge of a major, historic victory. The disparity between the price action and the relative valuation of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) on the one hand, and the accelerating business of the iPhone on the other hand, has gotten so extreme that an update of the case for this stock is appropriate. Here's a typical way in which AAPL is covered in the media, which shapes so much of the way investors and traders act. From the WSJ this Tuesday came Apple's Real Rival Isn't Google (WSJ subscription required at link). That title is OK: now that Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) no longer markets handsets, arguably Apple's "real rival" is the other handset manufacturers, most of which use some version of Google's Android OS. Curb your enthusiasm for Apple Inc.'s next iteration of the iPhone. That statement isn't based on any technical insight or leaked photos from Asian suppliers. Its battery life could triple, Siri become sentient and its front and rear cameras deliver more megapixels than the Hubble Space Telescope. Investors still would have to temper expectations. What the new device won't be able to do is alter the laws of economics and gravity... Although the first quarter of fiscal 2016 corresponds with the holiday shopping season, Apple may see its slowest year-over-year rise in iPhone unit sales ever. And if the analyst consensus estimate compiled by FactSet holds true, iPhone sales will enter terra incognita the following quarter by dropping for the first time compared with a year earlier. When the WSJ reports this as part of lead-in to the introduction of Apple's next-gen iPhone, it's a strong sign that institutional and individual investors are thinking this way. This opens up an unusual investment opportunity. A stock that arguably should be trading at a market P/E or higher is at a 40% or so discount to its multinational large-cap tech peers. The opportunity here stems from recognizing that the article, and therefore the mindset of Mr. Market, a known manic-depressive, is wrong in its facts and, more importantly, off target in a more comprehensive sense. Apple's iPhone appears close to an historic victory that, if achieved, would reverberate in a big way throughout multiple related industries - and would drive AAPL's share price much higher. Dissecting the WSJ's (and much of the Street's) bear case for AAPL The idea that investors need to "temper expectations" for the new iPhone is off target. AAPL is back to where it was about a year ago, despite beating EPS expectations every quarter since then. That's especially impressive, because each "beat" led to increased expectations. Thus, expectations have already been tempered substantially. The paragraph that contained the "temper expectations" phrase uses hyperbole that is normally used when describing a bubble stock. It is saying that even if the iPhone 6s, which as we know was introduced Wednesday as an evolutionary product, had been an unbelievable, unexpected breakthrough product, AAPL's valuation is nonetheless so extreme that investors simply must "temper expectations." But AAPL was already at roughly 10X FY 2015 EPS net of distributable, excess net cash, as the time of the product intro. When investors see this sort of language, we may tend to want to take the opposite side of the trade. Often, a stock of a company that may see flattish sales of its flagship product is presented as a value story, say this way: "At only 10-11X trailing EPS net of excess cash, XYZ stock has already discounted more than a year or two of flat sales. Yet investors have reason to look forward to growth down the road - and given the company's cash hoard and brand recognition..." Upside opportunity, or at least a margin of safety, beckons when a cheap stock is nonetheless presented so negatively in the financial press. So even if the bull case that I propound below does not really work out, AAPL has a clear margin of safety that, in my view, few stocks have anymore, no matter that the market (NYSEARCA: SPY ) is off its high a bit. Finally, and as a lead-in to my updated argument, the WSJ is incorrect: a product such as the iPhone that has a minority market share violates no laws of economics (or gravity) if it gains market share. The computer industry is littered with large shifts in market share. IBM (NYSE: IBM ) did not begin as #1 in mainframes, but then gained share - and ended up as a monopoly. Other companies gained share, only to lose it. However, there's actually a strong bull case for the iPhone that recent news suggests may show that a turnaround for AAPL may loom. The iPhone is close to a de facto monopoly due to its dominance of industry profits The iPhone is well-documented by various companies such as Kantar and ComScore to have been gaining market share almost in every region of the world ever since Apple introduced the larger-screened iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. That the iPhone has been gaining share even in Android-dominant Western Europe is impressive, as are its massive share gains in Greater China in a stagnant market. Given the cost efficiencies with the "s" series of iPhones as part of Apple's tick-tock approach to this product, and the various software (and hardware) improvements in the 6s, there is no reason to think that the trajectory of market share gains will be derailed. (This assumes that the new 3D Touch feature works well.) Even yoy stability in iPhone sales could well lead to some operating profit gains due to manufacturing efficiency improvements. While market share gains are nice, it's possible to buy them at the expense of profits, which is how the business world really works, New Age-type stocks notwithstanding. A 9to5Mac story discussed the profits story in July re the iPhone: Android may have the market share , but it's an entirely different story when it comes to profit share: the latest estimates from Canaccord Genuity indicate that Apple takes 92% of the profits for the entire smartphone industry despite accounting for only 20% of sales. Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) took a further 15% of the profits - and if you were wondering how that rather odd math works, it's because most of the other players make a loss, so the two companies make more profit between them than the smartphone industry as whole … Canaccord CEO Mike Walkley said that at the time Apple first entered the smartphone market in 2007, Nokia was taking around two-thirds of the profits (a far cry from today ). By 2012, the profit split was around 50:50 between Apple and Samsung. Since then, he said, the "high-end tier has really shifted away from Samsung to Apple." Apple's share of smartphone profits is up from 65% a year ago, though very slightly down on its 93% share in the holiday season. None of us can vouch for the precision of these numbers, but I will assume they are more or less accurate. Non-trivially, they ignore profits that Google reaps from the knowledge it gains from Android usage, as well as direct and indirect sales it gets from Android, but they also ignore direct and indirect sales Apple gets from the iPhone, so I'll accept them as valid. The key implication of the above is this: As soon as Apple saw the light and gave up its idee fixe that the iPhone could be no larger than 4" in its diagonal dimension, it immediately and without delay sucked up almost the entirety of all profits of the current machine that is changing the world. The next question is that it takes a specific company to beat Apple. Google tried and failed, finally selling the Moto brand it acquired only a few years earlier. Blackberry (NASDAQ: BBRY ) is nearly irrelevant, and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) has written off all of its $7+ B acquisition of Nokia's (NYSE: NOK ) phone division. Of course, there are some credible smaller players, such as Sony (NYSE: SNE ), but except for Samsung, the only real threat to the iPhone come from the ultra-low-margined Xiaomi and other Chinese manufacturers. But without much profitability, this sort of company cannot innovate and tends to end up trapped as a bottom-feeder. Thus the profits race comes down, for now, to how much staying power Samsung has. Samsung Electronics is a cog in the wheel of the parent chaebol, and the chaebol has numerous challenges both in its semiconductor division(s) and in its various heavy industries, given economic challenges in South Korea, where exports are plunging. We have an updated answer about whether Samsung Electronics can really keep up its estimated 15% profit share of the smartphone market. The answer looks like "No." Here's why, from Bloomberg News this Monday: Samsung to Cut 10% of Head Office Staff, Economic Daily Says : Samsung Electronics Co. is preparing to cut 10 percent of workers at its headquarters, according to a Korean newspaper, as the world's biggest smartphone maker loses sales to Apple Inc. and Chinese vendors. Samsung is targeting workers in the human resources, public relations and finance departments, Korea Economic Daily reported Tuesday, citing people it didn't identify. The Suwon, South Korea-based company also plans to cut some expenses next year, the report added... The moves come after new high-end Galaxy smartphones failed to impress consumers, triggering five straight monthly declines and wiping out more than $40 billion in Samsung's market value since April. The company's share of global smartphone shipments fell more than 3 percentage points in the second quarter, and it's no longer the top seller in China, the world's biggest mobile-phone market. "Cutting jobs is the easiest way to control costs and Samsung's spending on mobile business could also be more tightly controlled," said Chung Chang Won, an analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc. in Seoul. "Samsung's preparing to tighten its belt as it isn't likely see rapid profit growth in the years to come..." Samsung tried to attract customers before this week's product launch from Apple by advancing the release of new Galaxy models. Yet that failed to ease market concerns about its second-half earnings... This is what happens when a company knows it is losing. Weakness begets weakness. We have likely all either seen, read the transcript of, or in other ways learned about the updated iPhone 6s that is being introduced soon. For purposes of the thesis of this article, the only point I want to make is that the improvements provide reasons to purchase it, and the $100 price cut (US pricing) on the current iPhone 6 simply adds to its attractiveness. What this improved version means is that the iPhone's trend of profit dominance within its industry can continue. Lots of upgrades and switches to this size iPhone, either the '6' or 6s, appear likely. In either case, assuming the profit data presented above are correct, AAPL may be ready to earn, more or less, 100% of all industry profits. Let's quantify matters just a bit more. It has been reported that Apple plans to produce a record number of iPhone 6S handsets this year, aiming to top 90M units by the end of the year. In other words, either AAPL will or won't ship a lot more iPhones, or more at all, this fiscal year than next. But the stock is being valued as if it is AAPL and not Samsung that is shrinking. If Apple ships 90 million iPhones, that will be a rise of 15.5 million iPhones from the prior Q1, hardly "its slowest year-over-year rise in iPhone unit sales ever" as the WSJ article above suggested could occur. On a percentage basis, it would be about 20% increase, which is far more than the roughly 7% unit sales increase from Q1 2013 to Q1 2014. I think this is a plausible scenario. Only time can tell how the iPhone grows, and more importantly, how its profits grow both objectively and in relation to those of its competitors. But one year of sales is not everything. We have to consider that the iPhone's installed base, which Canaccord estimated at 400 million exiting 2014, is nearly certain to grow substantially. The iPhone installed base should be at least 600 million exiting calendar 2016, and that number does not require 250 million iPhones to be sold next fiscal year. This number may reach 25% of the total global smartphone installed base and is a growing percentage. This is a huge and growing advantage to Apple's consolidated sales and profits, not just those from the iPhone. This point of a growing percentage of the installed base of smartphones is just another way that the iPhone is putting relentless and increasing pressure on every competitor. Given the high profile of AAPL, it's worth saying that I'm not arguing the relative merits of the iPhone or AAPL's ecosystem, just the financial and profit trends. Sometimes a company just takes control, and that's the way it is. Let's examine a bit more the implications of Samsung's shrinkage and AAPL's potential further dominance of industry profits. What happens next if the iPhone attains a profit monopoly in smartphones? What if AAPL indeed sucks up essentially all the profits from smartphone manufacturing and retains that share of profits for at least a few years? The financial and stock market implications of this could be gigantic. The most obvious implication is that not only may Samsung retreat from the market, but other companies may follow its lead. This might lead to excess capacity amongst suppliers, allowing AAPL even lower component costs, faster supply times, etc. Then, it would be likely that Apple would end up selling more units as the competition thins out, especially at the high end of the market where the iPhone is positioned. If Apple is really going to run the profits table in the most important consumer product of the 21st century, its entire operations will strengthen. It will sell many more apps and more Apple Watches. More and more developers will work with Apple. More and more companies will partner with it. The MSFT appearance at Apple's Wednesday event may have had some significance, as might that of another historic rival, Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE ). Tim Cook's AAPL is one that has now created deals with IBM , Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ) and numerous smaller companies. This deal-making may just be getting going. That may have been the unstated point of the company doing a deal with its former rival IBM and now bringing MSFT and ADBE onstage, unnecessarily, to talk about apps for what will be a niche product, the iPad Pro. AAPL's subset of the world of computing may be consolidating around it, not completely but enough to allow investors to project faster and more certain profit growth than they now do. All this potentiality, plus great current value, makes AAPL an exceptional opportunity But unless trends reverse a lot, AAPL looks like a relatively safe stock (not that any stock is really safe). AAPL is currently providing its shareholders with about an 8% free cash flow yield based on historical, reported, in-the-books EPS. Leaving aside the above bull hypothesis on smartphones or other aspects of Apple's business, all AAPL has to do is grow FCF by an historically average 6% a year for the next 12 years to provide long-term, patient shareholders with a 16% FCF yield in 2027. Compare that to yields available from 12-year corporate bonds and one has to conclude that simply on a cash-on-cash basis, AAPL is attractive. Then, in addition to the cash returns, there will probably be substantial share price appreciation by 2027 even under these modest assumptions. No guarantees exist, but the odds appear favorable for AAPL longs relative to cash, fixed income, or other stocks that mostly have higher P/E's and lack AAPL's many advantages. The WSJ presented a reasonable version of the bear case on AAPL, i.e. that its flagship iPhone line, which accounts for most of its profits, may be about to show yoy unit sales decline. However, I would argue that even if this occurs, it might simply reflect global economic distress, which would hurt AAPL's competitors more than it. And if so, then there's always the iPhone 7 to look forward to. The bigger point is that smartphones are a growing, albeit maturing, industry. The yet-bigger key is that AAPL is improving its product line, expanding into new geographies (India), and the iPhone is gaining market share almost everywhere in the world, including Samsung's homeland. In a base case, taking the long view (which is how a growth-oriented stock needs to be viewed and valued), there is no obvious reason not to expect any large, strong company not to grow FCF at the rate of nominal GDP, which may be in the 6% annual range on a 12-year basis. If that's the case, then mathematically, AAPL could simply be an average stock and because of its low valuation today, end up as a fine buy-and-hold total return investment vehicle. However, evidence presented herein makes the bear argument look untimely. AAPL's only other significantly profitable smartphone competitor, Samsung, is shrinking substantially. This happens in a growing industry when profits are shrinking and are not expected to recover. Thus a realistic possibility is that soon, with a successful launch of the iPhone 6s, with a presumably-better iPhone 7 just one year away, the iPhone could achieve a de facto (95%+) profit monopoly amongst all smartphone manufacturers - while selling a minority of handsets. The upside EPS profit and P/E implications of this possibility could be extremely large and are not reflected in AAPL's share price. Thus I remain markedly overweight in AAPL and have added to my position recently. Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
