Microsoft And Salesforce: A Potential Marriage Made In Heaven - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Salesforce is looking to get acquired, according to recent reports from Bloomberg. Microsoft is one of the most widely cited candidate for such a deal. Satya Nadella should have no problem with securing the support of the board, as he has a lot of experience in cloud and enterprise (he can integrate the two companies). Satya Nadella is a part of the board, and has strategically positioned Microsoft to grow both cloud and mobile revenue. Over the long run, Microsoft can argue the mathematics behind such a deal without sounding unrealistic, or overly optimistic in its reasoning. Microsoft sits on $85.4 billion in cash. Very few opportunities could leverage the scale of Microsoft's cash pile (Salesforce is that rare exception). I've heard of crazy technology rumors in the past, but it's been a while since I've heard of something as crazy as a Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Salesforce (NYSE: CRM ) marriage . It seems feasible by the numbers, and by the looks of it, Satya Nadella has unanimous support by the board to pursue acquisitions, make strategic decisions, and return the company to growth. If Satya can argue the merits to Bill Gates, and a couple other major stakeholders in the company, the deal has some feasibility. There are only two other companies that can really afford to take this risk, and those two companies are Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ). Microsoft can't risk losing its edge in commercial software licensing to its two major competitors, so it has to at least consider the deal, despite its scale, and despite the lack of CRM's profitability. Google and Apple will eye the situation closely, as they're not very good at charging money for software. They're really good at monetizing a marketplace for software, but they don't have a software business that appeals to a broad customer base of business users. Google doesn't charge anything for its software, and Apple doesn't either. They're both commodity providers of software, and quite frankly, only Microsoft and a few other companies are really proficient at direct software monetization. Microsoft needs to build out this moat even further, and quite frankly, it can do this by reducing the number of competitors it has to compete with. According to Gartner, Microsoft had 7% market share in the customer relationship management space, and Salesforce had 16% market share. Unifying the product offering by creating integration into various other Microsoft products, and offering bulk licensing discounts in conjunction with Azure, Windows Enterprise, and various other software-as-a-service products could give Microsoft added leverage to gain a significant market position in various software verticals. I anticipate accretion from such a deal over time, as Microsoft can lower the rate at which it outlays its cost, even as revenue for the combined division grows at a 20% to 30% CAGR. For all we know, the segment could grow at an even faster rate assuming a broader software bundle can appeal to a broad base of business customers. If market share figures were to improve, the growth rate would most likely accelerate, as a larger software bundle will have more appeal to business customers. I can imagine the rumors to have legs if reputable research organizations like JPMorgan and PiperJaffray are willing to opine on the topic. Here's the logic presented by JPMorgan: Analysts at JPMorgan have weighed in on the stock and have reaffirmed an Overweight rating on the stock, with an upward revision in target price from $74 to $78. According to JPMorgan analyst, the stock could be worth $100 in the buyout. According to the analyst, the deal could be around $50 billion as it is currently valued at $44 billion; making this acquisition as one of the biggest deal in the software industry. There's compatibility in the culture of both organizations; therefore, morale-draining layoffs are unlikely. Microsoft can use the added human capital from software design and sales. If there are too many software engineers working on overlapping projects, Microsoft can assign software engineers to emerging projects, and reallocate the sales organization to handle other growth areas inside of the company like Office 365, Bing, and consumer electronics. Adding in the workforce from Salesforce into Microsoft's employee base will diminish the need for Microsoft to hire additional employees, and gives Microsoft further depth in terms of its overall employee pool. In Silicon Valley it's really difficult to hire and retain high quality employees, so gaining an entire organization gives Microsoft significant operating leverage, because it can improve profitability over time, while it increases efficiency. Unlike other industries, software business models tend to have really high margins, so building cost efficiencies seems feasible. Combining Salesforce's software cloud, with Microsoft's pre-existing server infrastructure may also result in unanticipated cost synergies as well. I anticipate Salesforce.com to generate a 25% CAGR over the next five years in terms of sales. For sake of estimation, that would imply revenue of around $16.13 billion. Assuming Microsoft can reduce operating costs as the business increases its volume, CRM alone could generate a 25% profit margin, which would translate into $4.075 billion in net income. I think revenue ramp will cause margins to widen, as costs won't scale as quickly as revenue. Microsoft is notoriously disciplined with its cash spend, and has an established track record of turning losing operations into reasonably profitable business divisions (just look at the transformation of Nokia (NYSE: NOK )). I think higher profit margins are attainable, due to Microsoft's lowered effective tax rate, as a result of Irish tax laws. Admittedly, these laws could change over the next couple years, though I reckon Ireland has little incentive to change its tax code. Microsoft may need to acquire CRM at around $50 billion, and assuming those future earnings get the conglomerate discount, the added $4 billion will likely be valued at Microsoft's earnings multiple. Microsoft has really high quality earnings, so investors may price the stock at an even higher premium over the next five years. So if the incremental earnings from CRM are valued at around 20x, the valuation for the acquired business segment could grow from $50 billion to $81.5 billion over the next five years. Microsoft sits on $85.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents. The company has grown its cash position by $10 billion per year, so the company has a ton of flexibility to both pursue acquisitions and return capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. Therefore unlocking some of the value in the balance sheet through a major acquisition of this scale could make sense for the company. It's not exactly clear how shareholders will respond. However, Microsoft has a really great track record of growing nascent business units into massive business ventures. So, shareholder buy-in seems likely. Microsoft's gaming and consumer electronics business would probably qualify for the fortune 500, and those aren't Microsoft's biggest business units in terms of revenue or earnings. The company is really massive, and I have reasonable suspicion that it can afford to absorb a couple additional companies, even if they were on the scale of Salesforce, as the company can pursue a combined cash and stock transaction. I think the dilutive effects would be offset with cash, increasing Microsoft's goodwill balance. The combined organization would probably fetch a market cap of $450 billion, as combining business units tends to put upward momentum into the combined valuation of companies so as long as institutional investors believe in the long-term accretion possibilities, which is already evidenced by the sell-side commentary. I think there's a decent likelihood that Microsoft will leverage some of its cash, especially if it can put together reasonable numbers for shareholders to sink their teeth into. Operationally, Microsoft has a lot of control, and quite frankly, building a reasonable break-even analysis that takes into consideration operational leverage through cost synergies, and incremental margin improvements wouldn't require rocket science. It's just plain accounting, and quite frankly, the presentation material will likely be convincing enough so as to get buy-in from the Microsoft board and major institutional shareholders. Of course, we've seen bad business deals in the tech M&A space, but this time around, Microsoft's operational excellence definitely mitigates some of the agency risk. There could be further upside for CRM stockholders. Receiving Microsoft shares in a cash and stock transaction wouldn't be a bad thing, as Microsoft trades on solid fundamentals. Investors would get the immediate upside from a buy-out premium that could be 36% above CRM's most recent stock price, and would also get the benefit of long-term appreciation from owning Microsoft (assuming Microsoft can match the long-term returns of the S&P 500, which it most likely will).
