Intel Gets Design Wins For Atom x3 From Non-Chinese Phone Vendors - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha After the Microsoft snub, I was wrong to say that Intelâ€™s Atom x3 will only get bought by Chinese white-box phone vendors. Cherry Mobile, the largest smartphone vendor in the Philippines, is using the Atom x3 for a sub-$50 Android phone. SNS Network, a Malaysian firm, has also released an Atom x3-powered Android phone. Cherry Mobile, the biggest vendor of smartphones in the Philippines, recently launched two new tablets and one Android smartphone powered by Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) Atom x3 processors. The new MAIA brand of tablets and phone from Cherry Mobile is exclusively using Intel x86 processors. I was therefore wrong to think that since Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) snubbed the Atom x3 for its latest Lumia 550 entry-level Windows 10 phone, Intel's 3G-only Atom x3 would only have Chinese phone manufacturers for a client. Cherry Mobile's launch of the MAIA series helps fortify my faith over Intel's future in smartphone application processors. Partnering with Cherry Mobile and local brands that are successful in their respective countries, gives Intel a chance to sell some more of its 3G-enabled Atom x3 chips. Cherry Mobile first teamed up with Intel last year with Windows tablets and smartphones. The Intel-powered Cherry Mobile Alpha Morph and Alpha Play Windows tablets were very successful here in the Philippines. What I can surmise now is that Intel likely told Cherry Mobile to create the MAIA branding to help distinguish Atom x86-powered devices from Cherry Mobile's other ARM-based Android devices. The MAIA Fone i4 is a 4-inch Android 4.4 OS dual-SIM smartphone with 512MB of RAM and 4GB ROM. It has a microSD slot, dual camera, and 3G HSPA+ connectivity. It uses the 28nm 1.0 GHz quad-core 64-bit Atom x3 SoC made by Rockchip. The MAIA Fone i4 retails for 1,999 pesos ($43) in Manila. The MAIA Fone i4 is therefore much cheaper than the cheapest Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) Snapdragon-powered Windows smartphone, the $86 Alpha Neon , also from Cherry Mobile. The 2,999-peso ($64.5) MAIA Pad is a 7-inch Android tablet with 1GB of RAM and Atom x3. It is almost as cheap as Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN ) $49.99 Fire Tablet. Yes, Intel is unlikely to be making any money from supplying chips to these two budget Cherry Mobile MAIA gadgets. However, the third one, the 8-inch MAIA Smart TAB is a dual-OS Windows/Android tablet that uses the 22nm Bay Trail Atom 3735F processor. Intel has stopped giving discounts on Bay Trail tablet processors. The MAIA SMART Tab therefore might be accretive to Intel. The obvious savings offered by a dual-OS tablet product will endear it to budget-conscious buyers. The 4,999 pesos ($107) MAIA Smart TAB is highly likely to become another huge hit here in the Philippines. The Windows 8.1/Android 4.4 feature of this 8-inch Intel-powered tablet makes it great for media entertainment, gaming and office productivity. I dare opine that the dual-OS flexibility of the MAIA SMART Tab makes it a better value-for-money purchase than the $300 Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPad Mini 3. Unlike Apple, Cherry Mobile gave it 2GB of RAM, a microSD expansion slot, USB OTG support, and 32GB of internal flash storage. This dual-OS tablet product is also special because Cherry Mobile is the official partner of Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) for Android One smartphones in the Philippines. Google intensely dislikes dual-OS devices but Cherry Mobile still went ahead with the SMART Tab. Intel's close relationship with Google likely helped Cherry Mobile get away with the dual-OS nature of the SMART Tab. Yugatech experts already said this cheap device is qualified for a free upgrade to Windows 10. They bought a MAIA SMART Tab and successfully upgraded it to Windows 10. The MAIA Smart TAB is therefore the better gadget to buy than the $132 Intel Atom x3-powered but Android-only Asus ZenPad 8 Android tablet. The quad-core Intel CPU and 2GB of RAM will let the SMART Tab run Photoshop CC and any other Windows software. Filipino-owned Cherry Mobile is often considered as the Xiaomi of the Philippines. It was able to dislodge Samsung (OTC: SSNLF ) as the Philippines' top vendor of phones by coming up with budget-friendly (but good quality) smartphones. Intel's management is smart enough to partner with the country's most successful phone vendor. Samsung and Microsoft continue to snub the x86 Atom mobile processors anyway. It will be sweet revenge for Intel to help local vendors kill the sales of sub-$100 phones of Samsung and Microsoft. The Philippines is now the third largest market for smartphones in South East Asia. IDC estimated that my country registered a 76% Year-over-Year growth in smartphone sales last year. Out of the 26.8 million that got shipped to the Philippines, 47% of it were smartphones. Intel is smart enough to exploit the popularity of Cherry Mobile's brand. The reality now is that global brands like Samsung are no longer dominant in some emerging markets. MyPhone and Torque are also local smartphone companies owned by Filipinos that are stealing sales from Samsung handsets. Just like in India and China, Samsung lost its sales leadership to local brands Micromax and Xiaomi. The partnership with Cherry Mobile is a great example of Intel's willingness to collaborate with successful Asian/European local brands. SNS Network of Malaysia also used the Atom x3 inside its JOI Phone 5 and JOI LITE 7 Android tablet. Just like Cherry Mobile, SNS Network first ventured with an Intel-powered 2-in-1 Windows 8.1 tablet. This eventually led to SNS Network branching out to selling Android phones with x86 Atom chips. Another non-Chinese OEM client of the Atom x3 is KIANO of Poland. The KIANO SlimTab 7 3GR uses the Atom x3-C3130 CPU. It also has 1GB of RAM, 8GB of ROM, and runs on Android OS 5.1. Intel is unlikely to quit the smartphone processor business anytime soon. As long as there are successful local vendors that trust the x86 Atom for their products, Intel will only get emboldened to produce better smartphone processors. Microsoft and Samsung are making a big mistake in ignoring Intel Atom chips. In the long run, those two global brands will get slowly killed by agile local brands that are able to offer cheaper phones using Intel-made processors. As per the example set by the sub-$50 Cherry Mobile MAIA Fone i4, the Atom x3 processor might be the key piece towards Google fulfilling its dream of selling $50 Android One phones for emerging markets. Google already failed with its first generation of MediaTek-powered $100 Android One smartphones in India. Coming up with a $50 Android One version of the Intel-powered MAIA Fone i4 might be Google's saving grace. I again reiterate my position that Intel should quit wooing the elusive Microsoft Lumia business. Intel instead should do its best to get inside Google's Android One global campaign.
