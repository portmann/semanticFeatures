Tim Cook's Touch Reduces China Risk For Apple - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Q2 figures show that the interests of China and Apple are increasingly intertwined. Apple Pay may have problems gaining traction there. Tim Cook has shown great diplomacy in his relations with Chinese authorities. China is a key market for the Apple Watch. The glittering success of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) in its sales and marketing efforts in China, as well as the fact that most of its manufacturing is based there, leaves it potentially over-reliant on China. It should not be forgotten that China is still a communist country and capable of taking instant critical action against companies it does not like, as Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and others have found to their cost. So far though, Tim Cook has displayed a Midas Touch in relations with the country's authorities, while recent administrative and legal decisions bode well for Apple's future stability in the country. As CFO Luca Maestri pointed out in the conference call , this puts Greater China quarterly revenue at US$16.8 billion. Sales in China now account for 29% of the company's total revenues. There was a 100% increase in App Store revenues, an increase in iPhone sales of over 70% and even iPad sales grew impressively amidst a sharp decline in iPad sales elsewhere. Tim Cook also emphasized how strong Mac sales were in China, up 31% in a market where it is reported that PC sales had corrected 5%. In contrast, Mac sales worldwide grew 16%. So these results have shown that the full suite of Apple hardware, software and retail is expanding rapidly in China. Figures from Kantar for the three months up to end-February had shown iOS market share in China up to 27.6%, from 21.6% in the three months up to the end of December. In October last year, when the iPhone 6 was released, market share was only 15.7%. In the conference call, Tim Cook made reference to the fact that Apple has recently gained more than nine points in market share, according to Kantar figures. Apple was the second largest phone brand in China behind local company Xiaomi, according to the Kantar report, though other reports subsequently have put Apple ahead of Xiaomi now. Which company is exactly number one or number two is less important than the huge dollar sales such figures represent. According to the latest figures released by analytics firm App Annie , China now downloads more apps than any other market, having overtaken the US. As Tim Cook stated in the Q1 conference call: Our online revenues in China last quarter were more than the sum of the previous five years. And so it's an incredible market. The graph below shows the rate of growth compared to other markets, and there's little doubt China will overtake Europe as the second biggest market for Apple this year. China has probably become Apple's single biggest market for the iPhone already and the rate of increase over other countries is only likely to grow. The country has approximately 885 million mobile phone users. The mobile phone market is expected to grow at only about 10% this year. However, there is a huge upgrade cycle into which the iPhone is tapping as the vast majority of consumers still have only basic feature phones. Analysts are predicting that in the developed world smartphone sales will decline 16% this year. I personally have doubts about that figure, but if true or almost true it will again increase the importance of China to Apple's figures. The fact that in Q2 revenue worldwide for Apple grew 27.5% but for Greater China rose 71% summarizes the increasing importance of China in terms of pure figures. This is so far only up and running, quite successfully, in the US. China is an important key element in making Apple Pay a worldwide successful payment system, but there are problems to overcome. State-owned UnionPay is the sole conduit for interbank payments in the country, but talks with UnionPay and other banks have apparently stalled. There seems to be two main problems . First, Chinese banks are reckoning Apple's commission rate of 0.15% of every 2% credit card company fee which is too high. Second, companies such as UnionPay, Tencent ( OTCPK:TCEHY ) and China Telecom (NYSE: CHA ) already have systems in place they want to protect. One strong positive for Apple, however, was the declaration in April that the Chinese Government would pull back on bank technology regulations that would have required companies such as Apple to hand over source code and encryption keys. Revised regulations are set to be issued by the China Banking Regulatory Commission. Furthermore, the authorities have also stated they would be opening up bank card processing to foreign firms. Tim Cook no doubt has much to do yet to get Apple Pay up and running in China, but his past diplomatic touch in the country bodes well for what may have to be a long and patient game. Apple's manufacturing processes in China are well-known and are important to the country. This symbiotic relationship of mutual benefit between Apple and China should be a source of reassurance for Apple investors. This is especially so at a time when the country's manufacturing and exports have been starting to flounder. For instance the latest PMI output figures for the country came in at 49.2, representing a decline in output. Apple products have been variously reported to add about 1% to China's manufactured export figures. Investments and commercial activity in China carry the related high risks of piracy and of the laxness of intellectual property rights. Crucially though Apple seems to have these under control and Chinese authorities are increasingly applying the rules in an equitable fashion despite some of the anti-Chinese rhetoric one hears. A good example of this has just been announced . A three-year legal battle has been concluded in Apple's favor by appeal to the Beijing Higher People's Court in which a Chinese company had claimed to have the patents for Siri. This was after the Intellectual Property Office had ruled in favor of the Chinese plaintiff. Though in itself not a huge case this is a very important indicator that increasingly the rule of law does prevail in China. Cook's latest move in April to set up solar energy plants in the country would seem to be another diplomatic master-stroke. It comes at a time when the Chinese Government is pulling out all the stops to tackle the country's critical pollution problems. Scheduled to complete construction by the end of the year in Sichuan Province in the country's South West, the two plants will produce 80 million kilowatt hours of power annually. In this Apple is combining in a joint venture with SunPower and a consortium of Chinese companies. Apple is ramping up its retail presence in the country. At the time of the Q1 conference call there were still only 20 stores in the country compared for instance to the 265 stores in the US. On the Q2 conference call, Luca Maestri pointed out that they were on track to have 40 stores open by mid-2016. Apart from the benefits this brings to the whole suite of Apple products, this may be seen as especially vital for the Apple Watch. China is a target market for the watch, especially for the high-end versions costing up to US$10,000, in a country where status symbol time-pieces are "de rigueur" for the upwardly mobile middle class. Pre-order inventories of the top-of-the-line gold Apple Watch Edition sold out within an hour of release. McKinsey & Co. recently released a report predicting that China would account for 20% of all global luxury consumption this year. At the Apple Watch presentation in March, emphasis was placed by Apple on the six stores it had opened in the country in the previous six weeks and the roll-out to follow in which the number of stores will double by next year. Apple's potential problem in China is a symbol of its amazing success there and as such can be seen as a good problem to have. The Apple Watch, and long-term Apple Pay, will only increase the importance of the country to Apple. A major falling out with the Chinese Government would no doubt decimate the Apple share price, but in my opinion this is highly unlikely under Tim Cook's sensitive leadership on the issue. A macro fall-out between China and the US is of course possible, but then the whole world economy would be impacted. This becomes more unlikely as the world's two largest economies become increasingly intertwined. Apple is symptomatic of this as it too becomes increasingly linked in a positive way with Chinese government and commercial interests.
