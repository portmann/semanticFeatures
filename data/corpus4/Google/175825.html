Microsoft (MSFT) Presents at Deutsche Bank 2015 Technology Brokers Conference (Transcript) | Seeking Alpha Okay, everybody, why don't we start. We are very happy to have a hot cloud company in Seattle join us for this slot. I've been instructed to read the Safe Harbor Statement before we start. So before we begin, Microsoft may make some forward-looking statements during this presentation and you should refer to their SEC filings for the risk factors relating to their business. And that's true whether you're here in person or listening in on the web. So, check. Mike Schutz is kind enough to have flown down to join us for this DB event. Mike, maybe you could talk a little bit about your role but, in terms of title, General Manager of Cloud Platform Marketing, which you know is part of Microsoft's broader cloud and enterprise unit. But maybe it's worth starting with a little more of a description than that so everything is in context. Absolutely, thank you for having me, Karl and hi, everybody. So again, my name is Mike Schutz, I'm the General Manager of Cloud Platform Product Marketing. My responsibilities include our Cloud Platform capabilities, so that one include, private cloud, capabilities like Windows Server System Center, the public cloud with Microsoft Azure of which I expect to talk a lot about today. And then our enterprise mobility capabilities would also fall within that umbrella of the Microsoft Cloud Platform, so a few of the products within our new Cloud enterprise division, and so really pleased to be here today. Got it. So that’s an important point just to start off with, that when people think Microsoft Cloud, they generally think Azure or maybe broadly defined include Office 365, but the definition you just provided of cloud platform extends well beyond that. That’s right, so if we start at the top level we think about the Microsoft Cloud, as the Microsoft commercial cloud, we think about Office 365, dynamic CRM and Azure in the capabilities within it. So if we double click within the cloud platform capabilities we really want to focus on -- there's this some 40 odd services within Microsoft Azure, those roughly fall into a category like infrastructure as a service and from a hybrid cloud prospective as well as just raw storage and compute in the cloud platform capabilities. Platform is a service so I don’t think organizations think about modernizing our applications. ISVs think about building cloud native applications into SaaS apps. There's a lot of platform capabilities that we offer in Azure, a data platform capabilities, you think about extending the value of applications and really taking advantage of big data analytics, Hadoop, structured and unstructured data, machine learning, extending into advance analytics and into IOT. And then lastly enterprise mobility and so in the increasingly mobile world, how do we help organizations get a handle on the security manageability of a mobile productive workforce, providing a companion service to Office 365 to help organizations secure the devices through applications and ultimately the data. So that’s kind of the breadth of the cloud assets. And then we also think about offering consistent private cloud capabilities so organizations can build a private cloud and hybrid clouds using the same technologies that were cut from those same as cloth as the public cloud and put them in their data center. And Mike when you think about across all of these cloud assets and you think about recent demand trends, what are some of the things that you've picked up that and feel like their inflection points changes in the last -- you pick at six months, whether the kind of workload that Microsoft's customers are using, whether it's verticals that have really inflected in terms of the migration to the cloud, what are some of the demand trends worth calling out the group here? Sure, absolutely. So the first thing -- the biggest changes happened over the last 12 to 18 months has been the conversation has shifted from why cloud to how should I move to the cloud or how should I embrace it. And different verticals have different challenges with respect to regulatory compliance, data sovereignty, geographic distribution, et cetera. But by and large we're seeing a tremendous appetite for decision makers, NIT decision makers in the line of businesses to look at the cloud, whether it be SaaS apps, whether that be just thinking about modernizing our infrastructure. Infrastructure-as-service has proven to be the lowest friction way to start in the cloud. So if you think about starting in dev test, bringing your application just to try it out and then bringing those applications back on [trend] as a starting point. Think about there's a lines of business applications in infrastructure and service and the benefit of infrastructure-as-a-Service has always been -- you kind of can take an existing app without modification and run it into cloud, even though it wasn't designed to be in the cloud. And so a lot of customers have taken that step at least for a part of their application at stake. And it's less about moving the app and more about how do I think about extending my data center or extending my IT assets into the cloud. And so in term of the demand signals that we're seeing, one, just a huge explosive growth in infrastructure as a service but as organizations get more comfortable with the cloud and they understand the benefits of not just some cost savings, but ultimately the agility into which they are able to provide to the organization to be able to do things faster instead of waiting weeks or months to get a server deployed or an infrastructure or new app deployed, I can do that on demand. Moving into higher level services like Platform-as-a-Service or getting more analytics capabilities and so -- we're seeing a lot of increased usage in some of these higher level services as one example. Got it. And maybe as we dive into these different components of Microsoft's cloud platform and you mentioned at the beginning that this is likely we'll talk Azure to start if that's alright, that's a hot topic. Obviously Microsoft doesn't disclose Azure revenues, but talked to you on the call gave us some usage metrics which suggests it's growing at a pretty good clip. But obviously AWS is a giant and is multiples larger than Azure, whatever the Azure number is. You've got competitors like Google, you've got IBM with Softlayer. So it's hyperscale but it's also hypercompetitive. And so I think everyone would love to hear what are the two or three main ways that you're trying to differentiate in the infrastructure space, and in particular, just because AWS is so big, how are you differentiating against AWS? Sure absolutely and it’s a great question, we often have the dialog with our customers because many customers have tried or used AWS, and so it's absolutely a dialog that we have frequently. You talked about hyperscale, that fundamentally is one of the ways that we differentiate. There's only a couple or three hyperscale clouds out there in the world, us being one of them. We operate today in about 19 regions, which means we have 19 data center regions globally. We continue to expand as our customers need us to do so. To put in a perspective, that’s about twice as many as AWS and about five or six times that of Google Cloud platform. And so even if you combined AWS and Google Cloud we're in more regions than the two of them combined. And so hyperscale is important, it's important to our customers because they want our service where they are and where their customers are. And so that’s one of the fundamental tenants, but AWS is big too and so the other elements and this is where really the differentiation comes in, is around hybrid, because of our fundamental strategy to help customers deploy the same technologies that we put in our public cloud hyperscale data center and run those in their data center on top of hyperV, on top of our systems center assets as well as bringing Azure infrastructure service and platform as a service capabilities to run in their data centers. They then have the flexibility to help decide which applications move and when. We also have a set of capabilities that provide connective tissue between the private cloud and the public cloud, whether or not customers are running our private cloud technologies are not. Example, there we have a storage product called StorSimple that is -- think it like of Set-top-box for storage in their environment, it's an iSCSI storage device that plugs in to an existing environment on premises and it just looks like a storage area network. And it seamlessly tiers the storage to the cloud. And so customers can think about their data center as seamlessly extending to ours and that’s a fundamental differentiation to our approach with respect to the other hyperscale cloud vendors, is it's not public cloud or bust, we want to meet customers where they are. And so that’s the hybrid element, very core to our strategy, and frankly quite important to our customers, because they have existing assets that they invest on our premises and how can they extend those and yet still fully embrace the public cloud. The other element is around our enterprise routes and enterprise grade support. And so we have some 650,000 partners worldwide, so we have a very broad footprint into our existing customer base with our trusted partners. We also focus very hard on security and privacy and compliance, we were have a first public cloud provider globally to support the ISO 27018 standard which has the highest standards of privacy today, and so very important to our international customers as well as our customers here in North America. And so the enterprise credibility element of our DNA and helping customers in the enterprise is very core to our strategy. So those are at a highest level kind of "why Microsoft?" From a capability perspective we're also differentiated in the level of services that we have relative to our competitors. Infrastructure-as-a-service, as I said there's a lot of players there. Microsoft and AWS are both leaders from Gartner's Magic Quadrant perspective in infrastructure and service, but AWS is not a leader in public cloud PaaS platform and Microsoft is -- as well as storage as a service where Amazon also plays and so think about the breadth of the Microsoft offering. It helps align with where our customers are looking to move overtime as I think about application modernization and not just running the Amazon in the cloud, as well as our broad footprint and our trust that we have in the enterprise community. Yes and actually on that question I know Microsoft hasn't disclosed it so Zack is probably going to shake his head at you as I ask this questions. Can you talk a little bit about this differentiation between running VMs in the cloud? Pure compute service storage infrastructure versus the premium services on top. Any metrics you can share, maybe anecdotes, just around what that mix is for Azure and how it's changing? Let me tell you what we are seeing is outside of a specific metric, but certainly infrastructure as a service is an onramp to the cloud, but Azure App Service, which is a PaaS on Azure is a very fast growing service for us as some of our data platform services. And so we see the entry point that customers start will oftentimes be infrastructure as a service, and then they combine infrastructure-as-a-service plus next-gen app platform as part as they go out. So the move that we see are the addition of premium services, we will continue to see growth. Okay. And if I could ask you a question about one of the -- I think I get the opportunity to leverage Microsoft's incredible software portfolio but it's actually a little bit of a double-edge sword because if you get perceived by potential clients that Azure is a little bit too Microsoft-centric it can be a bad thing, because you got AWS pitching a sort of Swiss neutrality. So how do you get beyond that issue because you don’t really have a [indiscernible] in Azure, you don’t yet -- as far as I know have full Red Hat Enterprise Linux support on Azure. So I think everyone would love Microsoft to open up some more third party technology as part of Azure, where are you on that journey? It absolutely been a huge focus and I hope that everybody is seeing the progress that we have made there, in fact today about 20% -- over 20% of the virtual machines in Azure, talking about service, are running Linux. And so we think about open this very broadly, our platform use to be the Windows platform and Azure is now the platform that we focus on for any application, that could be Windows, it could be Linux and so whether it'd be at the operating system layer with Windows and Linux, whether at the data layers, so you think about we've got Oracle supported on Azure, SAP, IBM DB2 but also Hadoop, Cloudera, DataStax. So a lot of the most popular data layer capabilities, outside of SQL server of course to which we believe is great. But whatever a customer wants to do at their data layer, we want to support that. From a mobile device standpoint, we have great solutions to help customers build mobile apps and connect those mobile apps to Android, iOS devices as well, of course Windows devices. From a language prospective, we believe .NET is great but at the same time we want to make sure if developers are familiar with and would like to use Java, Node.js, PHP, Ruby, whatever they like to choose. We want to have those be available on Microsoft Azure. So we have made a lot of progress that’s supports any app, any OS on Microsoft Azure and we will continue to make announcements as we go on that. And do you think Mike, there's an opportunity to enhance the relationship, the partnership with the Red Hat to provide RHEL support on Azure? We have continued to make progress and are working on that, so we are excited about what the future might bring. Okay good. You mentioned just a minute ago flipping a little bit to the enterprise mobility side, that's an area that we're hearing from Microsoft more and more, it's seems to be one of your more popular "premium services" in your cloud platform. Can you talk a little bit about that? It sounds like you're putting up amazing growth, but a lot of people in this room are aware that AirWatch owned by VMware and is doing extremely well, MobileIron is there, obviously it's a competitive space, Blackberry just bought Good. So how do you differentiate yourself on that front? Well from an enterprise mobility perspective you're absolutely correct, we are very pleased with the growth that we've had and customer adoption and customer success with the Enterprise Mobility Suite. If you're not familiar with it, what EMS provides is the combination of a set of categories that up until this point has been discreet with point players in each one. So you're hearing about mobile device management and increasingly turning into mobile application management, where a discreet set of folks like AirWatch and MobileIron have played. We have got a solution there called Microsoft Intune as part of the mobile -- Enterprise Mobility Suite. From an identity management perspective and active directory and identity and protecting user identities, has always been critical to our customers, we provide an online service called Azure Active Directory Premium that helps to provide single sign-on and authentication control for all SaaS applications, Office 365, CRM online, but up to 25,00 other SaaS apps like Workday, like Salesforce, like others. And so IT can help control access and maintain the security of their enterprise that are using SaaS apps and so that's the key part of it. And then the last component of the Enterprise Mobility Suite is called Right Management and so it's a service that helps encrypt data and encrypt files and that encryption follows the file wherever it maybe, even if it gets saved on a USB drive. It can't be accessed by unauthorized users and so what we've done is we bring that layered approach to security from device, applications, data and the user identity itself and wrap that into an easy deploy, easy to purchase solution. And so in our last report we reported 17,000 customers are using EMS today, we continue to see great growth there and so very pleased with that. It's a perfect companion to Office 365. We have very deep integration with the Office 365 mobile apps on iOS as well as on the Microsoft platforms. And so we're really the only solution that has that deep integration with Office 365, which again provides just not only the breadth differentiation, but also the richness of the experience we can provide for an end user. And in this world of mobility the end user is really the king and the queen. It really is important that the end user have a great experience, as well as IT having the appropriate levels of control. Got it, we're going to take plenty of questions I'm sure about the cloud stuff, but before we open it up I want to ask a few -- about some other areas that you have responsibility for running traditional enterprise side. So you I think mentioned Windows Server systems centers stuff like that, so they all fit in the server product realm and we get those statistics and we are impressed by them. And the question specifically is that Microsoft has done a bang-up job on the server product side for several years, where you've been posting growth at close to the high-single digits low double-digits as far exceeded what Oracle and IBM and a lot of your big peers are putting up. I know there's a number of reasons there, some of it might be share gains, some of that might be you guys doing a great job with your maintenance attach rates, some of that might be pricing licensing changes. But, we're always eager to get some color on how you've been able to pull that off. Can you point to a couple of reasons why the server product number as of a last two years has been so good? Sure. I'll talk about Windows Server first and I think SQL Server is an important element there as well. From a Window Server perspective, it continues to be the most popular operating system on the planet, you look at all the analyst reports, you know it's somewhere between 70% and 80% share in terms of operating system shared -- paid operating systems. And where we see the continued revenue growth is because we've driven our business model largely around mix shift to the premium SKUs. And in the Window Server case that really revolves around the movement to virtualization. And so as organizations virtualize more of their applications and more of their servers, the premium mix of Windows Server continues to grow. And so even in a world where the X86 Server shipment numbers might be soft, the premium mix as organizations are vitualizing more of their infrastructure to squeeze more of the value out of it, we are able to benefit from the increased revenue from that. And then also because there's so much data explosion happening, you need servers to rash-in across that data and so, the data explosion not only helps our SQL Server business, which it absolutely does and I'll talk about that, but it also helps to drive more server deployments and not just in the cloud, it certainly on premises too. And so these secular forces of virtualization and data are really helping the server business particularly on our premium mix. On a SQL server front -- certainly the explosion in data and the consolidation customers are doing with respect to their database workloads is really beneficial to the SQL business, again driving at premium shift, more cores, more premium mix of SQL Server. And also the share gains with respect to SQL Server becoming and is a very mission critical workload now for organizations. So taking more of those tier one workloads and if you look at Gartner's Magic Quadrant for relational database systems, this is the first year Microsoft has passed Oracle because of our cloud assets, as well as the SQL Server strength on premises. And so that’s really helped fuel that growth in the traditional server business. Okay and on that Window server business, which if I'm not mistaken, is the largest component of the whole server product revenue bucket, SQL service obviously pretty good as well. When we look at your total server product numbers that you do disclosed, I think in the June quarter for Microsoft it decelerated a little bit. And I think it pulled down a little bit the commercial licensing growth numbers. And there wasn't much of an explanation on the earnings call outside of I think Amy flagged Windows Server managing to grow despite relatively weak X86 Server market. Could you elaborate on how the broader server product business did for Microsoft in the June quarter, and how Windows Server did in particular? Well the Windows Server a lot -- I think in constant currency was about 9% which did outpace the peers on the market. And so a lot of that is again fueled by the innovation that we've delivered in the last wave with Window Server 2012, as well as some of the announcements we made in 2016 wave. And so we're pretty excited and customers are pretty excited about the 2016 wave that’s in preview right now. It combines a rock solid virtualization platform with a lot of the new technologies that were born in Azure in the public cloud and we're going to be able to deliver those on premises as well as new container technologies, containers are pretty exciting these days. A new container technology that we'll be making it into Windows Server 2016, so a lot of that is fueling that growth. Okay. I've got a few more but I know the audience probably has a couple for you, Mike. So does anybody have any questions for Mike around Azure or around any part of the Microsoft Server product set? We'll go right to the front here. Oh, we have the mic in the back. Yes. There's been a fair amount of buzz that given the sort of latency and the sloth with which Microsoft or Microsoft, MasterCard and Visa have been securing e-commerce that you guys are having some very interest high level discussions with banks directly and other players about creating a browser solution that would secure e-commerce in a way that is copacetic with the internet in general. Do you have any -- and would likely be more operationally sound. Do you have any perspective on that? We don’t have any announcements to make today. In general whether it'd be in financial or any other vertical, we are very focused on the security elements helping organization to be more secure and using our cloud, but also providing products to help them secure their own, but no announcements. Okay, thanks for taking my question. My question was around, you hinted at something that Satya has talked about as well, but just the technology is being developed and the solutions being developed in Azure, applying those on premise and how that's potentially enabling share gains, can you walk through some of those dynamics and why is it this faster go to market, what's driving that improved technology just because it's done in Azure? So, the way they think about it is, there is a virtuous cycle between building it in the public cloud, battle testing it in the cloud and then bringing up for our customers to run in their own data centers. A great example here is just Hyper-V, our virtualization platform. We've had Hyper-V for a long time, we've been a leader with VMware in virtualization for the better part of the last decade. But now Azure runs on Hyper-V, so you've got hundreds of thousands of nodes, battle testing Hyper-V every day, that feedback goes directly into the Hyper-V product team, they then are able to make the product better and rock solid and then we deliver that to every customer, whether it be an enterprise customer or service provider and so that -- living the public cloud lifestyle and then helping organizations to put that in their own data center is really a differentiator of course. And the other areas where we are doing that is, even just simple things like the Azure Portal, this is the place where your average IT pro or developer goes up to spin up a VM or app on demand in Azure. We have brought that portal down so that organizations can run that in their data center with what we call the Azure Pack. And so again as a service provider, I'm a hoster, I don’t have to roll my own portal, I can use the one that Microsoft built and I can focus on higher level value added services or in the enterprise space where enterprises are really trying to be service providers to their business unit and be more agile. We can help them by delivering cloud computing technology that were battle tested in the public cloud and do that in their own environment. And then they can still make the decision when they want to go the public cloud, which applications go and by the way once they do that, the mobility it's there but because they have got the consistent platform on premises and off, so it provide a lot less friction for them to think about going to the public cloud. So it's that end to end vision, Satya talks about this sometime in terms of our server as the edge of our cloud. From a customer perspective, Azure is a seamless extension of their data center and that’s the virtual cycle from a product development prospective. And we started doing that in Windows Server 2012R2 the one that's in market, that’s kind of fueling some of the growth that we see here. But it's even more so in the 2016 wave. And so that virtual cycle of developing in the cloud and then bringing it to our customers on premises is really hitting its stride now. Thanks. Anybody else? Great I’ll keep going, Mike on the Windows Server side I think you have a legacy version of Window Server that’s going end of life, how big a deal is that for Microsoft? I suppose if you're up to date on your maintenance you get that for free, but maybe there's a large constituency that are not, whether it's a revenue lift, how would you characterize it as an opportunity for Microsoft? And it actually went out of support July 15, and so we have passed that date and so -- and as you point out a little bit different in dynamic with XP. A lot of customers had maintenance on the product and they hadn't yet deployed the newer version and so our focus has been to help customers get the newer version, but we are not necessarily focused on the revenue uplift that might bring. Okay. And further on the Windows Server side, when we in this room attend the Red Hat event it's basically a DockerCon event these days. So anything touching the server OS layer seems to be all about containers and all about the Docker ecosystem. And you mentioned earlier that Microsoft is providing Windows Server 2016 support for Docker. Can you elaborate a little bit on that? It just seems to be a very big deal on the server OS space. Absolutely in general from a cloud native and modern app development paradigm standpoint, the concept of micro services and containers are pretty hot these days, and so the public cloud providers and SaaS providers are pretty fluent in that and it's starting to make its way into the broader communities. Docker has really help popularized it because of some of the things that they've done to make it easy to consume containers and simplify it. And so going back a little bit about 18 months ago, we announced we'd have Dockers support on the Linux and Azure. And so we have had that support for while, we have made a couple of announcements since then with Docker, where we're integrating the Docker hub with Microsoft Azure and continue to deepen that, so that organizations who would like to use containers on Linux and do it with Docker, where we have pre-packaged solutions in Azure to do that. As an example, we've got Ubuntu image with the Docker tooling preinstalled that the developer can just spin up and get going very-very quickly. And so that’s traditional Linux containers on Azure with Docker, we've also -- as I mentioned announced that we'll be bringing containers to Windows Server 2016. And so we announced Window Server containers very similar to what Linux, the paradigm of Linux container, a light runtime that virtualizes the operating system instead of the whole server, so you can get high density and developers can be very productive in developing and blowing out new applications. And so that's in preview now, we've got developers trying it today and that will be part of the 2016 wave. We're also bringing a first of its kind type of container called the hyperV container, that brings the best of high density light weight containers that are known today in the industry with the additional isolation benefits that our virtualization context can bring. One of the things that we often hear, particularly from enterprises, is around the security of containers making sure that they feel comfortable using it. And so for customers that have un-trusted third party code, that they'd like one more layer of security in the container world, we've got this hyperV container and for the developer it really doesn't make any difference because it’s the same underlying Window Server container. It's just wrapped within other layer of security in terms of a hyperV virtualization context. And so again continue to work with Docker on this, we're in very deep collaboration. And then also bringing new container technologies that actually don’t exist today in the rest of the market in the next Window Server release. And then letting developers choose, if they want to run Linux containers, if they want to run Windows containers, they can do it on Microsoft Azure. Any last question for Mike? I'll end with one question then. A lot of the discussion around things like the server OS layer and the cloud end up with a conversation about next-gen cloud native applications, open source, et cetera. So it feels to me like all of the larger firms are moving a little bit more aggressively today to try to stay relevant in a world where the next-gen architecture and infrastructure looks different. It's very open source, it's very containerized, et cetera. So at a very high level what are the kind of things Microsoft is doing to stay relevant in that new sack that all the next generation of developers are building? Well part of it is making sure that we're working very openly in the community, whether it'd be the open source community and working with partners who are innovating in this space so that they can leverage our platform to be able to build those applications using those technologies. The other is actually just using some of the innovations that we've used containers and micro services on our own cloud for years, and then commercializing those and bringing those to market. And so both are own innovation, but then working very openly in the industry and the eco-system, like in the open container initiative with the Linux Foundation to help bring a unified container model to market. And so we're working very much with the open source community as well as with the development community that we've known for years. Got it. Well Microsoft is obviously having a ton of success with the cloud platform, so these are fun days for you at Microsoft and good luck continuing to scale this exciting part of the Microsoft story.
