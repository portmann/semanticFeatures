Tesla Is A Sucker's Bet - Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) | Seeking Alpha More than 99.99% of car companies go bust – it’s an industry that has, on the whole, made negative returns for its investors. Which is why Tesla’s $30 billion valuation is absurd, especially given the company’s unrelenting cash burn and mounting debt. In short, investing in Tesla is as foolish as buying an overpriced lottery ticket and expecting to win. Innovation, it is said, is the engine of economic progress. While this might be true, people who invest in innovation rarely get rewarded. Take the car. It's one of the most important inventions in the history of mankind. Had you seen at the time of the first cars the enormous positive impact they'd one day have on the world, you'd have said, "This is the place to be!" But you wouldn't have been more wrong. In the U.S. alone, for instance, some 2,000 car companies have come and gone since the late 1800s. Only the "big three" - Chrysler (NYSE: FCAU ), Ford (NYSE: F ), and General Motors (NYSE: GM ) - survive today. Two of these three also went bankrupt but, unfortunately, were bailed out. Even Ford, the only true survivor, was on the verge of bankruptcy at one point. Given this nearly 100% failure rate, the long-term odds of success for the young electric car maker Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) are close to nil. That's what the statistics say, anyway. Unfortunately, such "facts" are often ignored in the investment world. Which explains why Tesla's stock price is defying the laws of probability with an absurd $30 billion valuation. Perhaps if the stock's fundamentals justified its price tag this could be overlooked. But they don't. Tesla has been hemorrhaging ever larger amounts of cash since its founding more than a decade ago. It burnt through $2.2 billion in free cash flow in 2015 alone, and there's little evidence that things will improve going forward. This is a very serious problem given that Tesla's $1.2 billion of cash on hand is only enough to fund operations for about six to eight months. To make it to the end of 2016, the company will be forced to do another equity raise and/or pile on even more debt to an already over-leveraged balance sheet. Unless some kind of miracle occurs, bankruptcy is inevitable. $1.2 billion (cash on hand) / $150 to $200 million (monthly cash burn) = 6 to 8 months (survival without additional cash infusion). Adding the $865 million of untapped credit to the equation stretches out Tesla's survival to just over a year. This isn't the first time Tesla has been in this situation. In late 2008, the company literally came within hours of bankruptcy before luckily landing a new round of funding that helped keep it afloat. CEO Elon Musk later admitted he didn't think Tesla would survive . . . that "things were probably f---ing doomed." This near-death episode was repeated in 2013. In a desperate attempt to save the company, Musk tried to sell it to Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) for $6 billion (a lot less than shareholders might have expected). Fortunately, once again, sufficient last-minute rescue money came in to save the day, and buyout negotiations with Google ceased. Today Tesla finds itself in another similar cash-strapped situation. Whether or not Lady Luck will come to the rescue this time is difficult to know. What is known, however, is that there's only so much debt a company can sustain - with $2.7 billion of debt (not including off-balance sheet debt), Tesla is fast approaching that limit. But the bulls refuse to acknowledge this reality (just read the comments below to see what I mean). They've become so hypnotized by the Tesla growth story they're completely missing the financial disaster unfolding before them. All they seem to focus on is this fantasy that one day - in the distant and uncertain future - Tesla will become massively profitable and its stock price will shoot to the sky. Let's play devil's advocate and say the bulls are proven right. Tesla doesn't only survive but thrives. Over the next couple of years, its revenue triples from $4 billion to $12 billion and EBIT goes from negative $717 million to positive $1.2 billion (that's an EBIT margin of 10% - roughly twice the industry average). Even with these extremely optimistic growth and profitability assumptions, Tesla would still be selling for 25x EBIT based on the current price. That's more than three times the industry average of only 8x EBIT! The absurdity of Tesla's valuation becomes even more pronounced when we compare it to the valuation of a large, well-established car maker like Ford. Ford generated 38 times more revenue than Tesla in 2015 ($150 billion vs. only $4 billion). To put things even more in perspective, Ford's $9 billion in free cash flow is nearly equal to the sum of all the revenue generated by Tesla since its inception (~$10 billion). Given these drastic financial differences, Ford should be valued substantially higher than Tesla. But that's not the case. Ford's $54 billion market value isn't even twice that of Tesla's $30 billion market value. This can mean one of two things: either Ford is massively undervalued, or Tesla is massively overvalued. The latter is most likely true. No matter how you look at it, the fact is that Tesla is a foolish long-term bet. For the current valuation to make sense, Tesla doesn't just have to survive in an industry with a <0.01% survival rate, but it also must deliver long-term double-digit top and bottom line growth. Is this impossible? No. But it is highly unlikely. Intelligent investing is about making bets when the odds are in your favor; doing the reverse is a losing strategy.
