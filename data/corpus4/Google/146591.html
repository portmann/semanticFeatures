ETF Hub Aug 11 2015, 18:36 ET | About: Facebook (FB) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) is bringing video ads to its mobile ad network (the Audience Network) for 3rd-party apps. Also arriving are the company's Dynamic Product Ads , which display images of products users have previously seen, and Carousel ads, which let users swipe through up to 5 images of advertised items. Two video ad formats are supported: Native autoplay ads similar to the ones that appear in Facebook's news feed, and click-to-play ads that pop up on a screen. Facebook notes 80% of its Audience Network ad impressions now consist of native formats such as sponsored news feed posts. RBC predicted in June video ads - they carry much higher ad prices than standard news feed ads - will account for over half of Facebook's ad sales over the long run. The company recently began allowing marketers to only pay for video ads that are viewed for at least 10 seconds. Separately, Business Insider reports Facebook is working on an app that will push breaking news alerts from partner publications, with users selecting which publications they follow. The alerts would feature up to 100 characters, and a link to the related article on the publisher's site. Such an app would indirectly challenge Twitter, which is used as a real-time news source by millions of its readers. Many of the non-core apps launched by Facebook, such as Snapchat rival Slingshot and Flipboard rival Paper , have only amassed modest user bases. FB will be the internet in a couple of years literally... they are currently only second to googl but doing things smarter and more disciplined. Yes, FB is growing video exponentially and by some measures has already overtaken Google in videos viewed and video brand advertising. Mobile advertising is the great growth area of digital advertising and FB is rapidly growing its share of mobile ad revenue at the expense of Google. In that same period FB grew its mobile advertising revenue by more than 13 TIMES, and grew its market share from 5.7% in 2012 to 21.7% in 2014. However, Google appear to be the masters of creative accounting. The Alphabet reorganization appears designed to cover up the fact that just about all their revenue and profits are coming from digital advertising and they are wasting countless billions of dollars in all sorts of diverse loss making businesses. When I am looking for something I don't FB, I google. I am a long FB but honestly it will be an uphill ride for FB to out perform Goog.
