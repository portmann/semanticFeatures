The Problem With Shorting Disney - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Jul. 10, 2015  4:59 PM ET  |  About: The Walt Disney Company (DIS) , Includes: CMCSA , CMCSK , GOOG , GOOGL by: Dana Blankenhorn Disney's valuation is stretched, but so is the market. You may have to wait a long time to be proven right and still be short when Star Wars comes out. On the surface, the idea of shorting Disney (NYSE: DIS ) is mighty appealing. Yes, it's very expensive at 25 times earnings. Yes, it has over-run its industry, up 33% this year while Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) (NASDAQ: CMCSK ), its nearest analogue, is up just 13%. Yes, it's priced to perfection, especially since the top line is only growing about 7%, when you compare the March quarter to the previous year. What it looks like, in sum, is Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ). I have been down on Google for some time, and for many of the same reasons. Organic growth is slowing, to 12% in this case when comparing the March quarters. The valuation seems stretched at 27 times earnings. Margins are about 25%, as with Disney, meaning there's not much more upside available. Everyone seems in. And where has it gone since this stunning realization hit me? Nowhere, mon frere. It hasn't gone down, but it hasn't gone up, either. There's action in it - when your shares are priced north of $500 there's bound to be action - but it's day-to-day action, pretty much in line with market attitudes, or market attitudes toward big tech stocks. That's the case with Disney as well. Sure it's expensive, but the market is expensive. The market is expensive because the dollar is expensive and every other currency is dirt cheap. We're all one global market and things like that matter. Disney, like Google, or like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), is highly liquid. It's practically a form of currency in its own right. (Don't you wish you'd shorted Apple a week ago?) If you believe in the pair trade, you might want to try putting Disney up against Comcast, which it resembles in many ways. Disney has been rising in part on optimism about its movie franchises. Comcast has a movie coming out today called "Minions," testing whether a spin-off cartoon of "Despicable Me" has legs on its own. Comcast has been fairly innovative in marketing this movie, essentially sticking the characters into others' ads, which delivers more bang for the buck. They've even bought Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ) boxes. If Minions is a hit, I'll bet Comcast stock gets a bounce. The problem with shorting a popular stock is that you might have to wait an unreasonably long time to be proven right. In this case, shorting around a bad movie would seem to make sense. But Disney has already sold some dogs this year, including Tomorrowland , McFarland USA and Monkey Kingdom . Maybe you think Ant Man or The Jungle Book could be another John Carter , but even that dog did well internationally, and you may find yourself short when the next Star Wars comes out. So if you really fear what's ahead for Disney in the short term, sell what you have and walk away. Hope for another entry point that's lower down the road. Or wave the stock bye-bye until the next general crash, which could happen any day depending on how Iran, Greece and China turn out.
