Yahoo Is Not An Attractive Pick For Value Investors - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha We are concerned over Yahoo!'s lack of clarity, regarding it's next spinoff. Costs are high, while revenues are dropping (along with stock price). Rivals in search, news, and networking continue to soar. Yahoo! (NASDAQ: YHOO ) is disappointing its shareholders. Recently, the company decided not to spin off its Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) stake. Some key investors promise a proxy fight if CEO Marissa Mayer does not make more successful decisions. Instead, Yahoo! has reviewed a spinoff of its core Internet business. This will leave two companies: the first ( core ) will include Yahoo!'s traditional search, email, and Tumblr social media service, along with sites like Yahoo Finance; the second will be a shell company with a 15% stake in Alibaba. Yahoo missed last quarter's earnings projections, and the company cut its fourth quarter revenue outlook from the $1.3 billion in expected sales to a range of $1.16 billion to $1.2 billion. Gross search revenue did rise nearly two percent from last year to $870 million . Yahoo's traffic acquisition costs (what Yahoo! sends to its partner websites) quadrupled to $223 million in the third quarter, up from $54 million from the third quarter of the previous year. Since Dec. 3, 2014, Yahoo's stock price fell from a high of $50.28 per share to $35 per share as of late 2015. The company's buyback program spiraled, when Mayer took over, to its current level of $35 per share. Mayer, the former Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) executive, raised hopes for many Yahoo shareholders when she was named CEO of Yahoo in 2012. However, we wonder if she has done enough in her post. Many are calling Yahoo!'s trajectory vague. It's clear she must cut costs soon in order to remain competitive. With a PE of 134.7 (far higher than the industry average of 51), additional risk is present. Until more clarity is attained around the company's course, we reiterate our stance to cash out of Yahoo! (made more immediate by the confused core spinoff) and suggest growth picks GOOGL and FB instead. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
