Cardinal FANG, Fetch The Comfy Chair - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha The FANG stocks -- Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google -- are leading the market. Cloud services become more valuable as they scale. Before the correction created by China's market fall, big techs like the FANG stocks - Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), Amazon.Com (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) - were leading the market. It makes sense. There is a permanent change of leadership happening in this decade. Commodities like oil are becoming less important, more fungible, and even replaceable to an extent with renewable energy, which is putting a small but growing thumb down on the demand side of the scale. (The cheapest, and most abundant form of renewable energy remains efficiency.) This means technology services, which thrive in an economics of abundance, where costs and value per-transaction are constantly declining, have a natural market advantage. That was a long paragraph to digest, but the most important word in it was services. Products like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Watches and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) PCs rot on wharves like fruit, their value declining as soon as they are made. This has always been true, it's just being reflected in stocks now, because scaled services increase in total value as they grow. The more people on a cloud, the more valuable the cloud, just as in the 1950s TV networks increased in value as more people got TVs. While the Dow Jones has gone nowhere so far this year, down about 7.5%, all the FANG stocks have been on a tear. Facebook is up 15%, Google is up 25%, Amazon is up 71% and Netflix is up a whopping 140%. During the last hairy week, all these stocks have recovered better than the market as a whole. Facebook is down 1%, Google is down 1.7%, Amazon is up .5%, and Netflix is up 6%, while the Dow is down 2%. One reason Facebook may have made such a big deal out of having 1 billion users on Monday was just this lag. Market cap is an integral part of the "great game" that is being played out among the big services. It's not so much that Mark Zuckerberg wants to be richer is that he wants to compete with the other cloud service players down the road. The main reason Facebook has been lagging the others, and Netflix has been leading, may be because it is more dependent than the others on advertising, even more dependent than Google. With the web advertising thesis coming under criticism and pop-up blocking becoming ever-more common, I think this has pressured the stock. Investors prefer services that get cash from their users. Netflix's cash flow is entirely consumer-driven. Will this change? I think it will. While I currently own both Google and Amazon.com, my guess is that Facebook will do best of the big four over the next year or two. It will find ways to generate cash from consumers, and the ad-supported model will prove out, because it delivers sales and not just impressions to advertisers. But through the next recession, all four of these stocks will remain winners. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
