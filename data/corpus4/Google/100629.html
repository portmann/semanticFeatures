Why Facebook's Ad Prices Still Have Considerable Upside - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Some analysts believe FB's ad prices are nearly maxed out after its first quarter showed a sequential decline. FB's new ad products suggest this isn't the case. These new products should put FB on a playing field by itself, offering advertisers the ability to create actual revenue from ads. Facebook's (NASDAQ: FB ) ad prices have continuously soared since becoming a public company. While many investors remain somewhat infatuated with the prospects of video advertising these days, the reality is that most of Facebook's current business is tied to display ads, as is a large percentage of its future growth opportunity. That said, many analysts have debated the upside of Facebook's current ad pricing, after its first quarterly sequentially decline, the reality is that new ad products could very well catapult ad prices much higher to a new level. First and foremost, Facebook's sequential decline in ad prices was marginal, as it still managed to produce a 285% increase year-over-year in prices. Historically, the fourth quarter has been very strong for Facebook in advertising due to the holidays, whereas the first quarter typically reflects a slowdown. Therefore, investors should have never bought into the idea of peak prices for display ads, and judging by the stock price, the overwhelming majority of investors remain quite bullish. Still, all indications suggest that the way Facebook presents ads is about to change, and quite drastically, in a way that no other big advertiser offers. Up until this point, advertisers have been buying placement on Facebook news feeds, including likes and increased engagement. The hope is that by spending this money on advertisements that future posts will reach a larger audience, and possibly lead to product and service sales. After all, the goal of advertising is for it to eventually reflect as new business. Whether or not that actually occurs is quite difficult for Facebook to determine. That said, Facebook is now testing a variety of new ad products that will allow advertisers to realize that sale immediately, by the use of ads on Facebook. Or, in this case, a new subscription. With the above ad, users can subscribe to services or fill out forms in just two clicks, as explained by Facebook in a blog post . Now, the limitations for something like this are seemingly endless, whether you are applying for a credit card or subscribing to the Wall Street Journal. After all, Facebook is now storing credit card information on their platform, allowing users to send money via Messenger and is reportedly preparing to let users make purchases on Facebook with a single click. The above shows yet another Facebook is letting advertisers get more from their ads, making direct purchases with a Buy button. So, if an advertiser can gain new subscribers to their service or create actual revenue from their ads due to the Buy button, it obviously increases the value of Facebook's ads. In other words, advertisers are no longer buying placement on a social media platform alone, but also have the opportunity to create real revenue from their ad spending. Clearly, this is the future that Facebook foresees in their ads, a very wise decision indeed. So, just how much upside is possible with these changes? That's hard to figure, but keep in mind that Facebook earned just $2.50 in revenue per user during its last quarter, $8.32 in the U.S. and Canada. While it may seem that there is limited upside in Facebook's most lucrative market, the U.S. and Canada, be sure to remember that Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) is earning north of $50 in revenue per user. That's a wide disconnect between two of the world's largest platforms. If anything, once Facebook deploys ads on a large scale that allow the sale of merchandise, subscriptions, or enrollments, then it will offer advertisers something entirely unique. While Google's ads encourage link clicks (Facebook's encourage likes) that lead to a higher chance of product purchases, it doesn't give advertisers the ability to sale from the ad itself. Facebook will be the first to do so, and that adds value. Therefore, given the disconnect between Facebook and Google's ad prices, combined with Facebook having the best platform to provide direct selling due to user and consumer engagement, my belief is that ad prices for Facebook are going to soar quickly, and consequently, Google's could decline faster.
