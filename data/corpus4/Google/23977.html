Amazon Becomes An Investment With A Long Tail - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Amazon is constantly trying new stuff. Some if it works, some of it doesn't. There are plenty of growth catalysts and it has established leadership in long-tail sectors. As March has turned to April, so we have returned to "earnings season," with Amazon.Com (NASDAQ: AMZN ) expected to report on April 23. The consensus number is a loss of 12 cents per share with the top line growing 13.6% year-over-year, which would mean revenues of about $22.3 billion. Yes, the bears will argue that this whole company is a scam, that it never has made money and never will. But it does. It will. Bulls like me keep noting that profits are all reinvested. Bears reply that growth is slowing, that debt is increasing, that it's all going to come crashing down. Yadda-yadda-yadda. Fact is, I like Amazon.Com because it tries stuff. It's sort a merchandising version of Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ). (I know, Facebook makes money, Amazon doesn't.) Some things don't work (Fire Phone). Some things sound silly (Amazon Fresh). Some of its efforts seem predatory ( Amazon Home Services ), others futuristic ( Amazon Drones ) and others are just plain silly ( Amazon Dash ). But increasingly there is a there, there. You can get it anecdotally (some eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY ) merchants say they're switching their fulfillment to Amazon, which handles backoffice jobs for 2 million small merchants), or you can use data. Millward Brown Digital, which tracks consumer behavior, says Amazon Prime members pay $99/year and triple their use of the service, that their memberships cause them to not look at rivals such as Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) or Target (NYSE: TGT ), that the high quality of its service is one thing baby boomers and their millennial offspring agree on. Will Amazon show a profit on its Amazon Web Services cloud when those numbers are broken out? I don't know, but I do know the Amazon cloud is so compelling now that technology rivals are seeking to work with it rather than attack it head-on. It is the established leader in a fast-growing market. Amazon doesn't always win. Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) YouTube may beat its newly-acquired Twitch. Expedia (NASDAQ: EXPE ) may feel the expansion of Amazon Local into travel is a gnat on an elephant. So what if Dish Network (NASDAQ: DISH ) is using Amazon Home Services to sell what it offers - are they still in the league? What really makes Amazon powerful is its long tail service. Twice this week I went to brick-and-mortar merchants seeking obscure products - a laptop battery, a clip to attach my cellphone to my bicycle. Both times the stores sent me to Amazon.Com, with specific instructions on how to do my search. They didn't do this because they love Amazon. They did this because they want to keep my business, and it's easier to just refer customers with obscure orders to the service than to keep those things in stock. Buying Amazon today means paying two times revenue for an unprofitable company that derives most of its income from retailing, a business that usually sells at a discount to sales, not a premium to them. But if people are willing to pay nearly four times revenue for Lululemon (NASDAQ: LULU ), and that stock isn't even at a lifetime high with that price, why would you not want to keep at least some of your portfolio in Amazon, waiting for the next upside revenue surprise? Amazon has matured to the point where the quarterly numbers tend to drive the stock. The last quarter's numbers drove it higher. This quarter's numbers may disappoint. To that extent it's just a trade, and speculative. But over the longer run this is a big company, getting bigger, that knows its business, whose stock has gained 177% over the last five years and which has plenty of growth opportunities with which to secure further gains. I've been an Amazon bear before. I got burned. This is not a stock you time, one you go into and out of based on news or rumors. It has become an investment, something you stick in a drawer and look at in five years. Source: Amazon Becomes An Investment With A Long Tail Disclosure: The author is long AMZN, GOOGL, WMT.
