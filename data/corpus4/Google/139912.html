ETF Hub Aug  5 2015, 12:39 ET | About: Intel Corporation (INTC) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor The first CPUs based on Intel's ( INTC - unchanged) anticipated 14nm Skylake CPU platform (the successor to the 14nm Broadwell, launched last year) are the quad-core Core i7-6700K (4GHz.) and Core i5-6600K (3.5GHz.). The overclocking-friendly chips are aimed at gamers/enthusiasts, have MSRPs of $350 and $243, and (given Intel has only launched less powerful Broadwell parts) succeed the Core i7-4790K and i5-4690K (i.e. Devil's Canyon ), which are based on the 22nm Haswell architecture. Unlike their predecessors, and like Intel's 8-core i7-5820K (also based on Haswell), the chips support DDR4 DRAM. They also support high-speed PCIe 3.0 storage and more high-speed I/O lanes, and (though gamers would doubtlessly opt for a graphics card) contain a faster integrated GPU. AnandTech's tests turned up just an average 5% gain for the 6700K relative to the 4790K, albeit with much larger gains for certain benchmarks such as HandBrake (video encoding) and Google Octane (JavaScript). DDR4 yielded only a modest performance improvement over DDR3, but AnandTech notes the technology also provides density and power draw advantages. Skylake notebook/tablet CPUs are due in the coming months , as are cheaper desktop CPUs. More details are expected at the Aug. 18-20 Intel Developers Forum.
