Apple Profits As The Android Commodity Strategy Backfires In China - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha IDC has reported that Apple was the top smartphone maker by unit sales in China in Q1. This estimate may be low, as Apple's sales figure suggests the number is much higher. Far from succumbing to the commodity smartphone â€œthreat,â€? Apple's position as a premium brand has worked to its advantage. According to IDC , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) was the number one seller of smartphones in China in calendar Q1. According to the prevailing view of Apple bears, Apple should be succumbing to the relentless pressure of commodity Android smartphones. Why hasn't this happened? Because flooding the market with low quality "white box" smartphones has hurt the Android brand. IDC's report showed Apple and Xiaomi in first and second place, followed by Huawei and Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ). Samsung was number one last year. Apple grew the most y/y, by 62.1% to unit shipments of 14.5 million. As I looked over the numbers, IDC's estimate for Apple unit shipments started to seem a little low. Apple's y/y sales growth for calendar Q1 in greater China was 71% to $16.823 billion. If we assume that the iPhone percent of sales in China is approximately the same as the corporate average of 69%, then iPhone sales in Greater China were about $11.607 billion. With the iPhone ASP of $658, this comes to 17.6 million unit sales, well over IDC's 14.5 million for Apple. It may be that IDC's China sales estimate excludes sales in places such as Hong Kong that are included in Apple's reporting. Regardless of the exact number of iPhone sales, Apple's growth in China is breathtaking, and largely contrary to conventional wisdom, especially among Apple bears. Even now, I read "increasing commoditization of smartphones" being cited as a threat to Apple. China is the home of the "white box" commodity Android phone that has accounted for so much growth in the Android ecosystem in the past few years. If commodity smartphones are such a threat to Apple, why is Apple the number one smartphone maker in China? This is a very fundamental question that speaks to the fate of Apple and the mobile device industry. It remains to be seen, however, whether what has happened in China will be repeated elsewhere. The key to understanding the situation in China is this observation made by Kitty Fok of IDC: Smartphones are becoming increasingly saturated in China. . . convincing existing users as well as feature phone users to upgrade to new smartphones will now be the key to further growth in the China market. I would offer just a slight modification to Fok's assessment: The saturation has occurred at the "white box" commodity level. The competition for upgrades is primarily from this level into mid-tier and higher level smartphones, where Apple has positioned itself. Market saturation has been the case for some time in developed countries, so why does the situation in China seem to be working better for Apple? There are a number of factors that enter into this, chief among them is the poor quality of the white box phones. White box phones are considered little better than feature phones, and many Apple fans have argued that they shouldn't even be considered in the smartphone category. White box phones generally run some version of Google's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Android. My theory is that the poor quality of white box phones has left many Chinese consumers with a negative perception of Android. This may not be quite deserved, but it demonstrates what can happen when a brand is licensed indiscriminately. Part of the reason for Apple's brand strength is the fact that it doesn't license the Apple brand, and carefully controls the quality of the products it produces. When white box phones were fueling the growth of Android, and Android activations topped one billion, Google executives seemed not to care that white box phones might hurt the perception of Android. Now, they should be more concerned. Starting last year at Google I/O, we saw Google starting to exercise more control over Android and trying to increase standardization of the platform. We'll probably see even more movement in this direction in this year's Google I/O. Another factor that helped Apple is that personal electronics have become increasingly... personal. Devices that people carry around with them all day are seen as personal expressions of taste and wealth. The cheap commodity smartphone doesn't really fit the bill. And what of the "good enough" commodity smartphone, the smartphone that's a cut above the white box? In the bear fantasy of Apple's decline and fall, it's always the attack of the "good enough" commodity devices that does Apple in, because it's always assumed that "good enough" at a lower price will be appealing to consumers. If IDC's China data is any indication, the "good enough" smartphone will not do particularly well. Samsung and Lenovo, as purveyors of "good enough" commodity smartphones, tablets and other consumer electronics, both lost market share dramatically in Q1. Samsung suffered a y/y unit sales decline of 53%, Lenovo, 22%. China is also part of a global economic trend that sees many developing nations becoming increasingly affluent. As affluence increases, consumers become more discriminating, wanting products that reflect personal taste as opposed to being merely affordable. Just as consumers want products that seem less generic and mass produced, manufacturing technology has made product customization more practical. Manufactured goods are becoming increasingly built to order, customized to reflect the personal preferences of the individual consumer. In mobile devices, we're seeing the convergence of both trends in a new world of high-tech manufacturing that is increasingly custom and the very antithesis of commoditized. The backlash against generic white box devices in China may not play a role in other markets. However, the IDC report points out that Chinese white box manufacturers are looking overseas as a way to boost sales. Specifically India and Southeast Asia were mentioned. If white box manufacturers achieve significant market penetration in these areas, we can probably expect another Android backlash 2-3 years hence. And certainly, in India, there are low cost manufacturers already using Android in a way similar to the white box makers, although their brands are more identifiable. India and Southeast Asia appear to be the next growth markets after China for Apple, but Apple isn't done with China.
