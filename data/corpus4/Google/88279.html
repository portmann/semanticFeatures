Apple WWDC Vs. Google I/O 2015 - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple developed more relevant features into iOS, Mac OS and Apple Watch OS. Google on the other hand attempts to appeal to emerging market users, i.e. the company is moving further down market. Google's presentation material lacked imagination and creativity in comparison to Apple. At this rate, Google will lose the high-end of the smartphone and tablet market. This spells good news for Apple shareholders and also throws into question whether Android will add any meaningful upside to Google shareholders. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) blew Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) out of the water at WWDC 2015. I mean this as politely as possible to the good folks at Google who work hard to make Android the most accessible platform for mobile users in both emerging and developed markets. El Capitan, iOS 9, Swift, Apple Watch 2 and Apple Music took center stage at WWDC 2015, and quite frankly, the company was able to supplant Google's Android M every step of the way. Apple improved the speed, battery performance and power saving features for El Capitan and iOS 9. Head of software design Craig Federighi went on to demonstrate the updates to Mac OS and while there weren't many, the few improvements inclusive of multi-window accessibility and spotlight search indicates that Cupertino hasn't run out of good ideas. Apple built upon the showmanship model that Steve Jobs was known for. After all, there's no excuse for a California-based company to stink at this, as Hollywood is just a car drive away. There's an abundance of advertising and video-editing folk in Cali. In fact, it has the highest concentration of people who work in the media, film and marketing industry. It's sort of like starting a company in New York and forgetting about the "advertising creatives" that are street blocks away on Madison Avenue. Selling shouldn't be hard, especially when you hire the right people to do it for you. Somehow, Google's presentation was just another presentation, and next year if they show up with that same level of energy and creative talent, they're going to get dismantled by Apple. Typically, I wouldn't be so critical of any other company, but because Google is sitting on billions of dollars there's no budgetary constraint. So, next year they might as well throw money from the rooftops of their campus to better prepare for their next demonstration of Android. Google needs to create more brand uplift for Android. I don't care about their market share figures because they only have that kind of market share due to the partnership structure it has with various OEMs. The various mobile OEMs are having difficulty with communicating their competitive advantage in comparison to iOS and Windows. No one gets fanatical over Android. Google has to demonstrate more than just a technical understanding of their products and services. Google has to stimulate the imagination, and bring together richer - more emotional experiences that can somehow paint the empty canvases of the collective imagination of developers attending I/O. Federighi), Jimmy Iovine and Tim Cook showed up at Apple WWDC 2015, whereas a bunch of irrelevant mid-level execs showed up at Google I/O 2015. Absent of Sergey and Larry, I'm beginning to wonder how committed Google is to mobile software and devices. Sure, Google may have a different business model from Apple, and the two co-founders are probably very busy, but so is Tim Cook. Sometimes leadership is exemplified by the presence and active participation of the executive team. At Google I/O 2015, Sundar was on stage going on and on about how it has improved this feature or how that new feature is going to make your life so much simpler. Of course cranking the complexity down, and increasing the capability of a device is hard, but it's doable. Why this wasn't a priority up until Android M is beyond me. Apple has dumbed things down so much that it's probably impossible to compete. Also, the various AI features of Android M aren't that intuitive until you integrate all of your contact information and calendar information into Google Calendar. Therefore, the integration of the digital assistant into your life requires you to give information to Google. But, wait a second, doesn't Google farm the heck out of your information? Apple on the other hand adds complexity over time, thus making it easier for users to catch on to various shortcuts and commands. Each additional feature gets much more attention from the media and users, as Apple tends to make updates to the OS infrequently. Also, each update handles a major bug, or adds a significant feature advantage. Therefore, ecosystem fragmentation is mitigated, as each update is intended to generate a noticeable difference to the user experience and usability of the OS. Besides, Apple doesn't charge users for OS updates and also explains in concise human language the benefits to updating Mac or iOS to the latest version. To briefly summarize: iOS 9 will take up less space, improve speed and performance, has better security, and a super power saver mode to extend battery life. Simple right? It took me one sentence to explain the advantages of updating to iOS 9. Apple also added a unique feature for iPad that allows for a "track pad like" interface whenever a keyboard is present. I just need to combine two fingers and drag around, and I can alternate between a traditional laptop track pad and touch configuration. I also have the ability to run multiple windows on iPad. That being the case, I'm not saying that everything Google did lacked imagination or creativity. They were just creamed by Apple. If anything, Google's developer team should have prepared better and worked longer hours to ensure that the feature set not only appeals to emerging market users but also to the more affluent user base that adds the most monetary value. Apple's lead in software development is unquestionable as the various multi-tasking features are already patented, so Google will have to develop unique shortcut commands of their own for tablet devices. From what I have seen, Android for tablet is pretty mediocre and various tablet OEMs like Sony (NYSE: SNE ), Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) and HP (NYSE: HPQ ) are having a hard time differentiating the device category. Tablets weren't really given much thought at I/O 2015, and for whatever reason Google talked about Android M from purely the context of a smartphone user. Google didn't have anything noteworthy to offer on the topic of tablets, and quite frankly I'm not surprised. Apple at least invested huge parts of the keynote to the Apple iPad, and while tablets are becoming a niche device there's room to broaden the market potential. Apple's rumored 12.9-inch tablet will get a boost from the various multi-tasking features as it will round out the holes between a multi-purpose tablet and a full-feature MacBook. Admittedly, it's hard to tell, which device has more desirable capabilities, as the iPad Pro also has a larger app library and has multi-tasking and touch-based features. MacBooks are great for multi-tasking, and have meatier components for running demanding applications. Furthermore, El Capitan will boost Mac performance, so the PC segment should have no trouble with sustaining shipment volume growth. Apple iPad Pro could cannibalize demand for the MacBook Air. The new MacBook has a significantly higher price point than the MacBook Air, and is the new ultra portable Mac. The MacBook Air seems extremely redundant based on the performance characteristics of iOS 9 and iPad Pro, plus the iPad Pro is going to be even lighter and more portable than the MacBook Air. The 13-inch MacBook Pro could become the new low-end MacBook in other words. However, with Macbook Pro price points starting at $1,300, the next best alternative is to perhaps buy a 12.9-inch tablet priced at $800 to $1,000. This alternative PC-experience that closely integrates with iOS ecosystem could be the device that turns the entire tablet segment around. I have conviction in the long-run roadmap following WWDC 2015. I believe that the marginal improvements in performance and capabilities of iOS, Mac OS X and Watch OS 2 will create enough value for users and will sustain the price elasticity of demand. I also anticipate foreign demand and market share gains to drive enough volume uptick to drive mid-teen shipment volume growth for iPhone. The iPad on the other hand could have a banner year as both software and hardware will improve considerably. The installed base for iPad has aged quite considerably, and assuming a decent portion of users were to upgrade - growth will be abnormally high in comparison to prior year comps.
