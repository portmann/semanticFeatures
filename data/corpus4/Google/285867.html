More than 1/3 of Yahoo's workforce has left in the last year - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha To screen ETFs by asset class, performance, yield and more, check out the ETF Hub. ETF Hub Jan 10 2016, 18:46 ET | By: SA Eli Hoffmann , SA News Editor Talking with more than 15 current and past Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) employees, NYT says many have lost faith in Marissa Mayer's leadership. Only 34% of employees believe that Yahoo’s prospects are improving, compared with 61% at Twitter (another troubled tech company) and 77% at Google. Jeff Bonforte, an SVP and Mayer fan, says that she's the best boss he's ever had. But he also admits she's tightfisted with praise and sometimes displays a demoralizing harshness. "Marissa is the type of boss that makes you feel like you’re disappointing her at all times, so I always feel like I’m on the verge of being fired. It’s never, ‘Way to go, Jeff!'" As some investors press Yahoo to fire her, Mayer is crafting a last-ditch plan to streamline the company, including significant layoffs, that is expected to be announced before month’s end.

More than one third of Yahoo's workforce has not left in the last year. You need a new title for this. The headline is sensational but is not supported by the content of the article. Isn't this irresponsible and seriously misleading? Boot the headline writer off the island. Could the person have meant 33% churn? 1/3 of the management team has left? Perhaps they didn't want to stick around for a $2M to $7M holiday party that didn't include a pic with the $10M woman, Ms. Couric. It seems that a lot of people still like Yahoo other than the shareholders, employees, and many of the users. It's time for MM to go save the spotted snail. MM sounded like Jobs in the 80's and 90's before he was humbled and booted out of Apple by the Pepsi man.
