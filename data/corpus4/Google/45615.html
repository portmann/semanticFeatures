Why Microsoft Wants More Top-Grossing iOS And Android Apps On Windows 10 - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft announced yesterday that Windows 10 will let iOS and Android developers port their apps a lot more easily to Win32/.NET code. Microsoft's Project Underwood would let iOS developers quickly transform their Objective-C apps/games to run on Windows 10. Android developers can upload the APK version of their apps to Windows App Store, and Project Astoria will convert them to work on Windows 10 devices. The biggest news at yesterday's BUILD event is that Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) will make it easier for developers to port their apps to the Windows 10 platform. King Digital (NYSE: KING ) used Microsoft's Project Astoria and Project Underwood tools to quickly port Candy Crush Saga to Windows Phone 8.1 last December . Project Underwood is a tool for Objective-C programmers who create apps for the iOS platform. Developers can use Microsoft's Visual Studio to quickly recompile their iOS apps to run on Windows 10 computers and mobile devices. Likewise, Project Astoria is a universal tool for Android developers to immediately publish their native APK files to the Windows App Store. Microsoft's grand ambition is to have at least 1 billion Windows 10 devices within 2-3 years. Attracting people to buy new Windows 10 phones and tablets is only possible if the most addictive mobile games from Android and iOS are available on the Windows App Store. Microsoft wants more mobile apps and games so it can offset the declining revenue stream from Windows licensing. The 30% commission fees from the $30 billion/year mobile games industry is partly why Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Services division is now generating $5 billion in quarterly sales. The iOS app store is a monster cash generator because there are mobile gamers willing to buy $100 virtual superheroes from Marvel: Contest of Champions . Unfortunately for Microsoft, King's Candy Crush Saga is the only top-grossing iOS game that got ported to the Windows Phone 8.1 platform. The future economic benefits from Project Astoria and Project Underwood are easier to understand if we look at ThinkGaming's chart below. Apple gets a 30% cut from these six-figure estimated average daily sales of iPhone games in the United States. Microsoft's future revenue stream from mobile is a lot better if the other top-grossing games and apps from iOS also becomes available to Windows 10 device owners. Windows Phone's weak market share in the world is largely due to the recalcitrant attitude of developers. Consumers are flocking to buy $100 Android phones instead of $100 Windows Phones, because the app ecosystem of Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) is a lot bigger than that of Microsoft. Google and its partners don't mind selling sub-$100 Android phones, because selling virtual in-app items to gamers is very lucrative . The hundreds of millions of people who downloaded Clash of Clans helped make that game a $5.15 million/day monster cash generator as early as January 2014. Microsoft is clearly envious of Apple and Google's multi-billion revenue from app store sales. Like I mentioned above, there are people who readily buy $100 virtual mobile gaming items. Mobile gaming's estimated annual revenue is far higher than what Microsoft gets from selling low-cost sub-$100 Lumia phones. App developers like those people behind Clash of Clans and Game of War: Fire Age continue to ignore the Windows Phone platform. By introducing Project Astoria and Project Underwood, Microsoft might just persuade developers to port their billion-dollar grossing games to the upcoming Windows 10 platform. The company needs a strong games-driven app store to replace the lost revenue from giving away free Windows OS licenses and upgrades. Nadella's idea of letting Android and iOS game developers get friendlier with Windows 10 is in line with my firm belief that mobile gaming could be the most compelling reason for people to buy cheap Windows 10 devices. Sure there are now third-party emulators that let people run Android apps on Windows computers and tablets. However, Microsoft doesn't get a commission from the $24 annual payment that gamers pay to get the Pro version of the BlueStacks Android emulator. BlackBerry (NASDAQ: BBRY ) tried to lure buyers by making BlackBerry OS install and run Android APKs . But that trick did little to improve sales of BlackBerry OS 10 handsets. Buying in-app items inside BlueStacks is still processed through Google Play's store. Unless Microsoft buys BlueStacks or GenyMotion, the company makes no money from third-party Android software emulators. Nadella's approach of letting developers easily recompile their games for the Windows 10 app store is smarter than John Chen's virtual Android emulation trick. I hope that Microsoft offers a lower commission fee, say 15-20%, than the 30% cut that Apple and Android charges developers for app store sales.
