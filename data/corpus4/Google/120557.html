Apple Earnings Will Blow Past The Pundits, Again - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple's fiscal Q3 earnings will surprise analysts and many investors to the upside. Apple's guidance was probably too low and based on concerns about the Samsung Galaxy S6. As it did last quarter, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) will exceed its own guidance, as well as the expectations of many investment analysts when it reports its fiscal Q3 results on July 21. In the process, Apple demolishes widely held myths about itself. In the March quarter, Apple demolished the myth that the appeal of large screen iPhones would quickly diminish. In the June quarter, Apple will demolish the myth of Samsung's ( OTC:SSNLF ) invincibility. In fairness to the professional analysts whose estimates of iPhone sales for fiscal Q3 are well summarized by Philip Elmer-Dewitt , Apple's own guidance for the quarter was too conservative to begin with. I believe this was due to concern over the impact of the Samsung Galaxy S6. Unquestionably, the S6 is the best smartphone available in the Android ecosystem. Samsung had gotten the drop on Apple with its own Exynos processor for the S6, fabricated on Samsung's new 14 nm FinFET process. With its new processor, an arguably superior OLED screen, improved physical design, and the new Android 5.0 operating system, the S6 may have seemed a little intimidating. When all the results come in from Apple, Samsung, as well as the usual batch of research reports on the smartphone market, I think we'll see that the S6 delivered a glancing blow to Apple at most. There are a number of reasons for this. The design, although an improvement, is clearly derivative of the iPhone 4-4s generation that Apple left behind years ago. Also, although it looks great in advertising photos, when seen in person, it isn't nearly as finely crafted as the iPhone 6/6 Plus. Overall, the Samsung's processor in the S6 is faster than what Apple put into the iP6, but not decisively so. Android 5.0 offers many improvements over previous gen Android operating systems, but as Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) acknowledged at their IO developer conference , it is also very buggy. In terms of operating system/ecosystem, Apple maintained the more desirable position. As I pointed out recently in Apple Clobbers Samsung In China , Apple's sales in China drove iPhone y/y unit growth. Although the S6 was good, it wasn't good enough to supplant the iP6 in the eyes of Chinese consumers. Apple remained the aspirational brand, with Apple's retail stores serving to confirm this position. My estimate of iPhone unit sales is at the high end of the analysts' range, as reported by PED. As I discussed in my recent article on Mac sales , I believe IDC arrived at the correct number for Mac unit sales that will be reported by Apple in the earnings release. I also book revenue of $2 billion for the Apple Watch, as I discuss in my recent article on Watch sales . The year-over-year comps are pretty spectacular: 50% increase in iPhone unit sales, 45% increase in revenue, and a 49% increase in operating income. On gross and operating margin, I'm a little conservative for the following reasons. I believe that there were some unanticipated expenses associated with the Watch launch in terms of resolving production problems that drove down gross margin for the Watch. On operating margin, I believe Apple continues to grow R&D rapidly, and that there were additional marketing expenses associated with the Watch as well. I expect R&D cost to be $2.2 billion, and SG&A cost to be $3.6 billion for a total operating cost above the high end of Apple's guidance of $5.75 billion. Lately, there has been a lot of concern about the macro situation in China. L&F Capital has a good discussion of this in its excellent if somewhat conservative earnings preview . L&F concluded that there was no impact to Apple in the June quarter, and I concur. There may be impacts going forward. I believe Apple's share price has been held down recently by perceptions rooted in the two myths I've discussed above, as well as macro concerns. The myths have a lot of persistence because they keep getting recycled and promoted to some degree by the tech media. Whether this quarter's results will be enough to finally lay these myths to rest remains to be seen, but I hope so. Whether the breakout occurs this quarter or not, Apple investors can take heart in the long-term trend, as shown in the chart below. The growth in Apple's share price generally tracks Apple's income growth. So high percentage changes in income y/y will eventually translate into proportional changes in share price. There always seems to be some lag in the market's response to Apple's financial performance, as well as day-to-day noise in share price. Apple investors have to be patient when it comes to the response lag and simply ignore the day-to-day noise of Mr. Market.
