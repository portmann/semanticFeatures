A Microsoft Surface Phone Can Rival The iPhone 6s - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha The Surface tablet brand is now accepted as a bonafide luxury brand. Lumia is now popularly known as the brand for cheap Windows phones. Tony Bradley of Forbes is speculating that Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) could reveal a Surface Windows 10 phone next month. I agree with his outlook. I think Microsoft needs to drop the Lumia brand for its next flagship smartphones. After dropping the Nokia (NYSE: NOK ) name, Microsoft's previous releases of Lumia handsets were all cheap products. As a result Lumia is now synonymous with cheap Windows phones. Sad but true, smartphones of today are still considered status symbols. The "cool and rich" vibes of the Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) brand likely influences people who buy $700 iPhones. The unprofitable tactic of selling $68 Lumias is only feasible if Microsoft could implement a real alternative to Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Facebook's (NASDAQ: FB ) domineering platforms for mobile advertisers. I think Microsoft's hardware business will improve if it focuses more on higher-margin flagship phones that will cater to the often-discriminatory affluent sector of society. The core customer base of Apple is biased toward brands like the iPhone 6. This was made possible precisely because it was marketed as a luxury handset in spite of it being manufactured for less than $250 . Using the Surface trademark, Nadella can use the same trick of making $250 Windows phones and then selling them at flagship price tags of $500 or higher. The Surface brand of tablets has long established itself as a high-end product that sells for not less than $499. The continuing success of the $799 Surface Pro 3 9 (up 117% in sales over Q4 2014 numbers) even compelled Apple to copy it with the new Stylus-toting iPad Pro. Bradley's suggestion of a Surface phone is therefore the right step forward for Microsoft's new plan for its money-losing handset business. Bradley hinted that the Surface phone could come equipped with an x86 64-bit processor from Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ). This would make the Surface phone a mini computer that will be able to run enterprise legacy apps that are still exclusively only available for Windows 8.1 or Windows 7. It's my strong opinion that the true potential of Continuum for Phones feature of Windows 10 is best realized through Intel-powered smartphones. The ugly side of ARM-based processors is that they are unable to run important industry standard software like AutoCAD or Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE ) Photoshop. The usefulness of Continuum for Phones is severely limited if Microsoft again exclusively uses Snapdragon processors from Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) for its future flagship Windows phones. Office 365 is not the only software necessary in the workplace. Microsoft makes its Office bundle compatible with Snapdragon-powered Continuum for Phones-capable Windows 10 handset from Acer . However, enterprise and educational market clients might still find the Acer Primo Windows 10 smartphone inadequate if it cannot run their existing already-paid for custom x86 only software. Even before the Nokia D&S purchase, Microsoft already was working on a prototype of a Surface smartphone. The "Juggernaut Alpha" Surface phone was being tested in 2012. However, Elop was able to sweet talk Ballmer into buying Nokia's phone business, which led Juggernaut Alpha being shelved in favor of Lumia phones. I think the huge write-down of the Nokia handset purchase is now enough inspiration for Nadella to revive the Surface phone project. Imitating Apple's focus on high-margin handsets made it super successful. Selling $70 Windows phones is a pyrrhic campaign if Chinese and Indian companies could sell sub-$50 Android phones. The Lumia trademark ought to be relegated only for reasonably low-cost and mid-range Windows phones. The Surface should be the new brand for next-generation Microsoft-made flagship Windows 10 smartphones. Much like the Surface tablet deal, Nadella can again recruit Dell and Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ ) to sell high-end Surface phones to their enterprise clients. The prospect of an Intel-powered Surface smartphone which can replace office desktop computers is much more compelling than an iPhone 6S. MSFT will become a real long-term winner in the enterprise mobile device market if it can deliver smartphones that are real pocket computers. MSFT is a buy . This is a cash-rich, dividend-paying and low capital intensity company with a very wide moat . For the past 10 years, in spite of Nadella's decision to give away free Windows licenses is still posting growth in revenue. Disclosure: I am/we are long MSFT, AAPL, INTC, NOK.
