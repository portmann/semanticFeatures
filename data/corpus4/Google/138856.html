Facebook's Instagram Gets The Green Light To Show Ads And Buy Buttons - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Facebook is opening an ad placement API for Instagram. Advertisers can use the API to make layouts and add call to action buttons to buy products. Instagram has been tapped to go into the big league. It may not have the billion users Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) CEO Mark Zuckerberg said was necessary to be an "interesting business" just yet, but judging from initial projections some marketing research firms are putting out, Instagram will be of great interest to Facebook's ad revenue generation. Facebook is already the market leader in attracting online advertising spending, and its subsidiary Instagram is going to build upon that lead. eMarketer has produced a forecast calling for almost $600 million in mobile ad revenue just within this calendar year. By 2017, the internet market research firm estimates Instagram will generate as much as 10% of Facebook's total revenue, or about $2.8 billion. This is how Facebook can keep up with the lofty 30%+ earnings growth expectations the market is pricing into the stock. Instagram and WhatsApp have been sitting on the bench, waiting to get called up as their business models grow to a stage where they can pull their own weight. Less than a week ago, Facebook reported second quarter earnings, and revealed that of its 1.5 billion monthly active users, mobile monthly active users reached 1.3 billion, or 86% of the total. My thinking is that Facebook management has decided to look past the fact that Instagram has only about 300 million monthly active users, and focus on the rapid growth of mobile users, who advertisers will increasingly pursue. Facebook is striking while the iron is hot to bring those potential advertisers into the Facebook fold, and put more pressure on Google's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) YouTube for ad dollars. Expectations have been building up for Instagram to offer easy-to-operate ad promotions directly by APIs (application programming interface) similar to what individuals and businesses have been using to coordinate and manage their ads on Facebook already. Well, that time is here. The Instagram site has just made available its API that developers can begin registering their applications. Similarly, advertisers and businesses can put together layouts and add buttons like "shop now" and "sign up" for products and services. The API can be used to monitor and record ad progress and performance. For those who already have ad promotions on Facebook, they'll be able to manage both through the same interface on one device. eMarketer also has another eye-catching prediction- by 2017 Instagram could overtake the mobile display ad revenues of Google and Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) in the US. Instagram has less of a following overseas, but I am confident there still is a lot of open territory just within the US market for Facebook to add to its dominance in the online ad market. In the earnings call , COO Sheryl Sandberg said the company would be opening up Instagram to more advertisers, but she emphasized Facebook would be thoughtful and strategic about how Instagram revenue is ramped up. Throwing a whole bunch of ads onto mobile phone screens will quickly put users off. Matching video ads to user data analytics like in Facebook's NewsFeed would be more effective. The expanding use of video is key to bringing in and keeping users within the company's eco-system. I am bullish on Facebook stock rallying back up to $100 a share. Then when the first indications of the revenues Instagram can deliver start to come in this quarter, that would be a catalyst to push through $100 and beyond.
