Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! Peak innovation? What do call an iPhone 5S with some upgraded internals but costs twice as much? Simple. Meet the iPhone SE (Suckers' Edition?) The new iPhone may be nothing more than a rebranded three year old 5S (now in rose gold), but, according to 'Twitter' it has all these "must have" features: The cost: $399 for 16GB . But the real bet is that Apple's clients are all idiots who don't know how to do a google search and find effectively the same product for $199 at WalMart . They slashed the price of the Apple Watch (because it must be selling so well?) *APPLE INTRODUCES WOVEN NYLON BAND FOR WATCH Mon, 03/21/2016 - 13:56 | 7341795 Osmium Whatever happened with that dumbass (can't remember who it was) that said AAPL would sell so many gold plated watches that is would cause a huge spike in the price of gold?

Much like most top-of-the-heap techno-fashion companies, they steal/buy technologies they want to market more than they actually innovate, then they just rehash it over and over, convincing their fans they need to keep buying.

Ironically that was the only "big innovation" at MWC. I was hoping for googles project ara phone....  oh and about the article- dont buy iphone. Great hardware, great software, overpriced and most importantly: anti-open source, closed ecosystem, anti-innovation and customization. Too bad the sheeples need it to be in the sheeple club.  Mon, 03/21/2016 - 14:55 | 7342127 Kprime my wife has the galaxy s5 with replaceable battery, the last model with one.  It's a sweet phone.  awesome screen. personally, I gave up cell phones 3 years ago.  you can call me at home, where I don't answer the phone there either.

I've set a couple of them up for 'older' folks that are lost with them, but have received them as gifts. Mon, 03/21/2016 - 14:49 | 7342096 Normalcy Bias I think there will still be room for phones. Not everyone wants to carry around something so big that it doesn't fit into their pockets. Mon, 03/21/2016 - 14:21 | 7341932 More Ammo Gave the new controller a Samsung Alpha for a company phone.  She said it was too complicated and wanted an iphone instead.  Fucking POS took me an hour to set up company email on it, cause only the apple way is the right way...

Either they are a piece of shit or my kids play jump rope with them.
