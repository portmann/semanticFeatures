Twitter Still Has Some Hidden Ammunition To Help Grow Ad Revenue - Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) | Seeking Alpha Twitterâ€™s shares tanked badly after the company missed on revenue projections and issued light guidance. On the surface, it appears as if Twitter is running out of growth runways. Social media company Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) is all over the news right now, but this time for all the wrong reasons. Twitter released pretty awful first quarter fiscal 2015 results . Even though the company managed to deliver results that beat bottom line expectations after posting non-GAAP EPS of $0.07 against expectations of $0.04, the company reported revenue of $436 million, way below the $456.8 million that analysts were looking for. For the second quarter, Twitter guided for revenue in the $470 million-$485 million range, well below the $538 million consensus by analysts. For the full year, Twitter guided for revenue of $2.3 billion-$2.35 billion, again below the $2.37 billion that analysts were expecting. The report seemed to prove what some investors had feared all along: that Twitter was quickly running out of growth runways. Twitter's shares tanked around 18% after the disappointing earnings call. Twitter and Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) are some of the leading social media companies. Both companies rely very heavily on ad revenue for their top line - around 85% for FB and 90% for Twitter. LinkedIn (NASDAQ: LNKD ), another leading social media company, is not so reliant on ad revenue since only 24% of the company's revenue comes from ads while close to 60% comes from recruiters and hiring companies who pay LinkedIn to access potential job candidates on its platform. These form the acronym MACE. The infographic below helps explain how ad revenue growth for a social media company such as Twitter is calculated. The Monthly Average User, or MAU, growth can be somewhat an extrinsic factor since a social media company does not have direct control over the number of users that joins its platform. The company can only try to build an attractive platform that provides a great user experience then hope that people like it. Twitter's MAU grew 18% year-over-year to 302 million, which is a healthy growth rate. When it comes to ad revenue, social media companies have much more control over ad load and user engagement. In fact, these are two of the most important factors that can be used to determine the health of a social media company. Twitter's total engagements grew 32% during the quarter, which is a healthy growth rate especially when you consider that Twitter managed to achieve that against a backdrop of difficult comps because engagements had grown a hefty 694% in the year-ago comparable quarter. But ad loads are an altogether different matter. Trying to achieve an optimum ad load is usually quite complex because it involves a number of independent variables that have to be taken into account concurrently. Increasing the ad load is usually effective in growing a company's revenue in the short term. For one, marketers will almost always prefer it when your ad load is high. But overdoing it also can turn out to be counterproductive. Increasing your ad load too much can easily upset your viewers and even turn them away from your platform. As Nate Forrester observed, increasing the volume of in-stream ads is great for interactive marketers but makes for a poor user experience, a very critical component for a social media company. This is the biggest dilemma that social media companies that rely very heavily on ad revenue like Facebook and Twitter face. In fact, Facebook was lambasted by marketers in 2013 for what they termed the practice by the company to display only a tiny fraction of marketers' brand posts to viewers. These marketers claimed that Facebook showed each brand posts to just 16% of its users. To make matters worse, they added that only 15% of Facebook ads leveraged the company's huge cache of social data to target relevant audiences (which decreased user engagement). As a result, the marketers ranked Facebook as their least favorite marketing platform. As you can see from the infographic, both Twitter and Facebook were rated poorly by marketers in the 2013 survey. These marketers' gripe was that both companies display ads to just a tiny fraction of their available audiences. Mind you when marketers were saying this about Facebook, its ad load was around 5%. Later that year, Facebook doubled its ad load to around 10%. And that brings me to the main point of my thesis. Twitter's ad load currently is just 1.3%. That's way lower than Facebook's ad load when marketers were kvetching about its ineffectiveness as an ad platform. Twitter told Barron's early this year that it is shooting for 5% ad load , or a 285% increase. That's a huge increase that can provide a big lift to the company's top line. In fact, if all the other three determinants of ad revenue remain constant but ad loads increase around 280%, Twitter's revenue growth rate would more than double. And, there's really nothing to prevent Twitter from increasing its ad load to something close to Facebook's level, which translates to about 7.7 times their current level. After all, the two platforms are quite similar, and I never noticed any drop in Facebook user engagement after its large increase in ad loads. Twitter has been mulling over the question of whether to increase or not to increase its ad load for some time. The company had suggested that it planned to start increasing ad loads this year, but its latest earnings report shows that ad loads have remained constant. Twitter recently struck a deal with online ad giant Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) to make its inventory available through Google's DoubleClick. In my view, that's a potentially great move. Twitter has only 60,000 marketers on its platform, compared to over 4 million for Google. Twitter's ad units will now be available to Google's marketers which can increase both the volume of ads sold as well as their unit price. If Twitter substantially increases its ad load, you can bet that many of these marketers will view it in a much more positive light and will be willing to do business with the company.
