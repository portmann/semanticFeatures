Microsoft's BUILD Conference: Linux, Windows 10, And A.I. Chatbots Take Center Stage - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha This Seeking Alpha Eye on Tech Column looks at today's Microsoft BUILD conference announcements, during which the company disclosed Ubuntu Linux will run on Windows 10. Microsoft also unveiled its â€œconversation as a platformâ€? vision, in which intelligent chatbots are built into a variety of apps. Todayâ€™s announcements suggest Microsoft is counting on cloud services to grow its ecosystem in the face of iOS and Androidâ€™s mobile dominance. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) hasn't been shy about trying to win over Linux developers since Satya Nadella became CEO, and the company took its efforts to another level today at its BUILD developer conference: The popular Ubuntu Linux distribution will run on Windows 10 , following this summer's Windows 10 Anniversary Update. As part of the effort, which involves a partnership with Ubuntu developer Canonical, the Bash shell and Linux command-line interface will be available on Windows 10. Microsoft exec Kevin Gallo: "This is not a [virtual machine]. This is not cross-compiled tools. This is native." Developers (rather than consumers) are being targeted here: Linux continues to steadily take enterprise server share, and Microsoft has previously said nearly Â¼ of servers running on Azure use Linux. The company stated three weeks ago SQL Server will arrive on Linux by mid-2017. To the extent Microsoft's efforts boost Linux server usage, Red Hat (NYSE: RHT ) should benefit. Windows 10 updates and universal apps Microsoft announced Windows 10 is now running on 270M devices, up from 200M in early January. With the OS provided as a free update to Windows 7 and 8 users, a fast adoption rate was generally expected. Nonetheless, Redmond has to be breathing a sigh of relief over Windows 10's uptake, after businesses largely shunned Windows 8. Looking to boost Windows 10 tablet/convertible sales and perhaps also keep Apple's iPad Pro at bay, Microsoft has unveiled Windows Ink , a solution that tightly integrates stylus features within Windows and provides a workspace for accessing pen-enabled apps. New stylus tools are being added to Office and other apps, and the Windows Store will highlight pen-enabled apps. A Windows Ink demo. Source: Ars Technica. Efforts to get developers to embrace universal (cross-platform) Windows apps continue apace: The Windows 10 and Xbox app stores will be merged with the Anniversary Update. A tool that lets developers convert standard Win32 PC apps into universal apps has been released, and developers will be able to use the Xbox One as a dev kit. Arguably, the most important part of Microsoft's BUILD announcements: The company's unveiling of its " conversation as a platform " vision, through which a variety of chatbots will be integrated with Microsoft products, using A.I. to analyze natural-language human requests and deliver automated services. The move comes shortly after Microsoft pulled the plug on Tay, a chatbot aimed at younger users that was manipulated to make a series of racist comments. Nadella, whose company saw Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) dominate the last big computing platform shift, thinks bots could be the next one. "We think this can have as profound an impact as the previous platform shifts have had," he insists. Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) (via Messenger) also has big plans for chatbots, and Google reportedly plans to support chatbots in a new messaging app. The Cortana virtual assistant is a key part of Microsoft's bot vision, learning about user preferences to make bots more intelligent and sometimes even directly sending requests to bots based on user activity. As is the Bot Framework , a new set of tools allowing developers to build chatbots into apps. Skype is getting both Cortana and bot support, and a demo showing off the new features managed to impress. Cortana highlights important parts of a Skype conversation and surfaces information cards, while bots are used to do things such as book hotel rooms and add calendar events. Microsoft notes Skype now has over 300M monthly active users, and has launched a developer program for third parties looking to create Skype bots. Cortana has also been integrated with Outlook's e-mail and calendar tools, and is getting third party app support. In addition, Microsoft has updated the Cortana Intelligence Suite (formerly known as the Cortana Analytics Suite), which pairs Cortana with Microsoft's Power BI business intelligence software, to include support for the Bot Framework and a set of "intelligence APIs" for deciphering human interactions. Microsoft declares the suite can now be used to create "new apps that learn about our world and bots and agents that interact with people in personalized, intelligent ways." Ahead of BUILD, long-time Microsoft follower Mary Jo Foley suggested the company is moving away from the "cloud first, mobile first" vision frequently espoused by Nadella in favor of just a cloud-first vision. Though multi-platform mobile apps are still clearly a big part of Microsoft's agenda (as its recent M&A activity demonstrates), today's BUILD announcements do indicate the company is betting heavily on cloud-based tools and services to grow its ecosystem in a world where PC sales are still declining and iOS and Android loom large.
