Apple: M, Cortana And Now Are Putting Pressure On Siri - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple is apparently making a push into building out its machine learning/AI human capital capacity. Apple wants to bring Siri closer inline to being competitive with Microsoft's Cortana, Google's Now and new entrant from Facebook M. Apple is at an inherent disadvantage when it comes to machine learning and predictive analysis because of its privacy policies. I opine that Apple shouldn't try to be innovative, because of its privacy driven disadvantages, but simply stay on the heels of the latest developments if it can. It's a good thing that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has apparently been aggressively hiring AI specialists. VentureBeat is out reporting that a former employee familiar with the matter has observed that Apple's AI-development human capital capacity has quadrupled the last several years with a particular focused ramp taking place as of late, as it appears that Facebook ( FB ) also is going to be putting an increased demand on an already very finite commodity of talent. Facebook is out with news that it has been and will continue developing its own human-blended personal assistant tech named "M." Facebook has as well been aggressive in staffing up its human capital for this vertical and my take on M is that it should force Facebook to continue to do this for the mid term at the very least, likely for the long term. So Apple being ahead (or behind - depending on how you view the space) of this curve is likely to be helpful to its efforts. What are its efforts? Apple wants its iPhone's, of course this likely also includes the entire product ecosystem inclusive of the iPad, to be the most predictive and most helpful in the space. With underlying hardware being hard to differentiate between devices (spare me the Apple has "by far" the best phones rebuttal - full disclosure: I use all Apple products) the software and more specifically how automated the software of a phone/phablet/tablet can make a user's life has become a big point of differentiation. This is an area in which many looking objectively will admit that Apple has fallen behind. While I don't expect Apple's efforts to inject new capacity into Siri to be anything along the lines of what Facebook is trying to accomplish with M, I do expect that Apple has quite a few tricks up its sleeve for the next Siri iteration. But Apple, in all its aesthetics and in all that it does better than everybody else, would do well to simply catch up to everybody else. Apple's Siri is behind Google's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Now and Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Cortana in a big way - in fact I might argue Siri isn't even a good comparison to those two. Now, as described in the VentureBeat article, not all of this is Siri's fault or the developer team's fault - some of this has to do with Apple itself. It's Apple that values privacy over almost anything else. It's Apple that has uber-limited storage of learned information and it's Apple that won't upload a lot of information to the cloud for group learning. That's like studying weather in one particular region and then extrapolating that data on a global basis. While you might be right in some circumstances you're likely not right in many. And what happens when the information changes? For Apple's Siri issues, what else is to be expected when working with an incomplete data picture? So, without knowing if we'll get an update at Apple's upcoming event with regard to if Siri will be getting any immediate term upgrades, I think Apple should focus on just playing catch-up. If Apple can find ways to simply stay just on the heels of new "assistant" features that should be enough when coupled with Apple's reputation for device excellence and its loyal following to capture a large market share. I personally think that Apple is focusing (not all of a sudden but all of a sudden with such efforts) on Siri/Machine Learning/automation because Apple is positioning itself to be the device of choice for the non-consumer segment. This is a vertical that Microsoft has been more than open about wanting to aggressively pursue. Without at least a level-playing assistant/predictive automation operator tech I just don't see how Apple pitches itself to market leadership in non-consumer mobile. I think Apple can definitely do at least level-playing even while boxing itself into a machine learning corner. Again, I also think this should be the company focus - simply staying on the heels of everybody else. But what of the future? What of Facebook's M and Microsoft's Cortana and it's anybody's guess if IBM (NYSE: IBM ) is working on a deployable assistant that it wants to license out - with a Watson backing, this is totally realistic (purely speculation at this point). There are some things, I'm sure, that just aren't going to be doable at scale (at Apple's scale at least) without huge data capture and huge data science. This has been something that Apple has already struggled with according to many in the Machine Learning niche. VentureBeat polls several sources which conclude this but this is something that is talked about in Austin tech circles often as well and that I've heard many times. I just think that if Apple is serious about taking down non-consumer like it took down consumer that it's going to have to open up its privacy policy - even if just simply for the purpose of helping it help users, which I think users would be on board with. For now though, it looks like this is going to be a rare blind spot for Apple - one that I think it's acknowledging exists with its huge hiring initiative. I think this means that Google, which has SMB/enterprise aspirations as well, and Microsoft have an early head start (also rare for these two) in market share opportunity for the non-consumer vertical. It's one that they would be wise not to waste (Microsoft has now had two delays for its Surface Hub launch) as this market is much, much more sticky than the consumer market. It will be interesting to watch Apple the next few quarters to see if any updates to Siri are announced (in my opinion "Hey, Siri" has been an absolute disaster.) Apple also might be looking to get aggressive with M&A to pull forward R&D development. It might be worth scanning the SMIDcap and micro-cap horizons for names that are active and competent in this space for potential exit opportunities. While Apple's machine learning lag isn't a reason to be concerned about the company right now, maybe ever depending on which direction the company leans, if Apple wants to compete in non-consumer this could become a headline issue in the near term. Let's hope Apple gets its figured out. Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL, FB. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
