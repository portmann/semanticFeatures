Facebook Reports A Decent Quarter, Offering A Mix Of Good And Bad - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Facebook remains a compelling investment for growth-oriented investors. While top line results missed consensus estimates, I anticipate that various factors will drive top line results in future quarters, offsetting the recent disappointment in Q1 results. Facebook was unwilling to break out the monetization of video ads and investment in certain areas of the organization is somewhat questionable. Facebook needs to offset increases in R&D and CapEx with reductions in COGS and SG&A. Investing in Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) at such a rich earnings/sales multiple contradicts conventional wisdom. In fact, investing into Facebook isn't for everyone. So to be fair, I'm going to present the various factors driving growth while also mentioning some of the risks of owning Facebook in this article. Despite offering a balanced viewpoint on Facebook, I'm still adamantly bullish on the stock. So, if you're looking for analysis that supports a bearish viewpoint, you won't find much to your liking in this article. MAU and DAU trends have improved modestly, whereas ARPU grew by 25% year-over-year. The increase in ad pricing paired with the growth in MAUs in adjacent properties like Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp supports the stock's high valuation. Revenue is growing at a torrid rate. Video ads and a scarcity of ad-inventory will increase CPMs, which will support ARPU growth in the interim. Ad inventory will continue to grow due to an increase in the amount of content found in the average user's newsfeed. Facebook has developed new features to engage users, which is why the average session length will continue to trend higher. An increase in session length will increase the number of native ad units that Facebook can display to users. Facebook's ad network across mobile and non-mobile devices offers publishers a healthy alternative to Google's Ad network. Since Facebook has developed extensive partnership agreements with various ad agencies and operates a network of websites, FB's publisher network has enough scale to rival Google AdSense. Therefore, monetization of off-site ad inventory should add legs to FB's growth rate. There's also the hidden x factor of Oculus Rift, which is a VR headset targeted at PC users. The PC gaming ecosystem is both healthy and large, as Steam has over 75 million members, according to Alienware. Direct X12 is expected to improve the overall graphical capabilities of add-in-boards by a significant magnitude. After consulting with technology experts who frequently attend technology conferences, photo realistic gameplay is perhaps five to ten years away. Assuming graphical capabilities of PCs reach that of photo-realistic environments, the marginal value of a VR headset will improve considerably. Facebook will likely capitalize on both the software and hardware of VR as it has both the technical capability and financial resources to expand the market potential of the device beyond that of a narrow niche. Facebook missed on the top line, which is a first since going public. Perhaps analysts are getting a little too aggressive on their revenue models. Also, monetization of the FB messenger app is up in the air as displaying ads on the messenger product or charging for the service is clearly off the table. Some FB products are going to carry earnings and revenue while other products are unlikely to contribute to either earnings or sales in a very meaningful way. Facebook wasn't willing to break out the monetization of video ads on the conference call. When taking into consideration the monetization potential of pre-roll ads, or video ads in general, it's a tough pill to swallow. I'm not just curious about the amount of revenue Facebook can make on video ads, I demand to know this information because it makes it easier for analysts to anticipate the shift in revenue mix and how it will impact top line growth in future fiscal years/quarters. Facebook's expenses as a percentage of revenue have trended higher. Now, normally, I'm a little more open minded when a company wants to invest back into their business. However, Facebook's core app has reached saturation in the United States and Europe. Facebook's other mobile products will continue to grow regardless of Facebook's spend rate on marketing. While it makes sense for Facebook to increase the size of its salesforce, why is it increasing as a percentage of revenue? In other words, I don't understand why the direct sales organization needs more investment when much of the ad-sales can be taken care of by a computer that matches bidders with the available ad inventory. Facebook's SG&A and COGS as a percentage of revenue should be trending lower (even if just slightly). R&D and CapEx as a percentage of revenue should continue to trend higher; this way Facebook can maximize the value of every dollar that it generates from operations. From what I saw, Facebook delivered reasonable EPS and revenue figures for the most recent quarter. Various non-core services like Instagram and WhatsApp will add significantly to Facebook's valuation going forward. There's also room to improve the business operationally as spending on R&D and CapEx should be highly prioritized over non-core spending activities like SG&A and COGs. When weighing the good and bad, Facebook remains a solid growth investment. Therefore, I continue to reiterate my buy recommendation as the stock trades at a reasonable valuation relative to its growth potential.
