If YouTube Is Valued At $80 Billion, How Much Is Netflix Worth? - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha YouTube is reportedly valued by analysts at $70 to $90 billion. They called YouTube â€œa big asset that warrants a big valuationâ€? to the tune of 7-9x forward sales estimates. Despite accelerating revenue growth, YouTubeâ€™s operating model isnâ€™t quite as good or as profitable as Netflixâ€™s business. Netflix probably deserves a premium to YouTube. Sporting a $46 billion capitalization, Netflix has room to run over the next cycle given a long tarmac for international growth, untapped pricing power and an enviable platform operating model. The cable television business - specifically the business of distributing content - is becoming commoditized and finds itself at a crossroads: a tired industry ripe for disruption given the disintermediation allowed by ubiquitous high-speed internet and new service delivery platforms. Meanwhile, consumers are speaking with their wallets: Q1 2015 experienced an accelerating number of cord cutters in the United States. The cable industry is responding to this threat, in turn, by accelerating consolidation to preserve the benefits of scale. But consolidating a mature and potentially declining industry can only work for so long. I believe the stage is set for a significant redistribution of market cap between incumbent cable operators and fast-growing Web 2.0 platform models. What is abundantly clear is that given the choice, consumers are shifting their content consumption preferences to over-the-top ("OTT") platforms to curate a better viewing experience and manage costs by unbundling unwanted content. Given those secular industry dynamics, investors ought to position their portfolio for 2020 and beyond by owning the dominant, market cap redistributing, global content aggregator/owner with an enviable platform model and best street-level value proposition for consumers: Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ). That is to say, the stock can and will be volatile over the next 5 years, but ultimately intrinsic value is set to rise significantly in the years ahead. What investors need to know is Netflix - even with a 245 TTM P/E ratio, yikes! - has the potential to grow into a $100 billion+ market cap as the platform becomes stronger with increasing subscriber counts, rising contribution margin and differentiated, proprietary content. While Netflix isn't your typical "value" stock, it does enjoy an ever widening moat and an operating model that benefits from a "virtuous cycle" that is becoming more evident with each passing quarter. Here is how the virtuous cycle works: as Netflix subscriber counts ramp, Netflix has more money to invest in unique, proprietary content, which, in turn, makes creative content creators more willing to work with Netflix relative to other studios (creative latitude and wider audience), which, in turn, entices more consumers to subscribe to Netflix for access to the unique, differentiated material they can't get anywhere else. And with the help of the recent FCC ruling to uphold net neutrality, Netflix can scale extremely quickly with little risk of data throttling or onerous interconnection fees from network operators in the US. Speaking of scaling quickly, in the most recent quarter, Netflix added a Q2 record 3.3 million subscribers bringing its total subscriber count to over 65 million. Growth continues to accelerate internationally where Netflix has its largest and most untapped market opportunity as well. Netflix recently rolled out its service in New Zealand and Australia, and expects to enter Japan later this year. The beauty of the Netflix model is it gets more powerful and valuable with scale and features an extremely sticky, recurring revenue stream from an incredibly light-weight asset: the content library. Pro question: what is the incremental cost for delivering already developed proprietary content to the next 65 million subscribers? Hint: not much. It costs next to nothing to seamlessly register new users except for some variable marketing/promotion/customer acquisition costs, thereby allowing Netflix to benefit from the inherent operating leverage in its business model as it scales (incremental revenue from new subscribers far exceeds the incremental expenses to service new subscribers). To that end, Netflix's contribution margin (that is, margin dollars after all variable costs) should continue to expand towards 40% over the next five years and drop contribution dollars to the bottom line at a rapid pace as the business matures consistent with a high-margin, platform model with limited fixed overhead. When Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) acquired AOL in a deal valued at $4.4 billion in April, a clear strategic message was sent to market participants: content is king. While selling high-speed internet access - essentially the digital distribution of content - is a predictable, recurring revenue model (albeit experiencing pricing pressure), data networks require massive maintenance capital expenditures to operate effectively. Content, on the other hand, is a light-weight asset that once developed, can continue to be monetized indefinitely with little incremental cost. House of Cards, for example, will likely be revisited by the next generation of TV viewers and continue to generate revenue for Netflix well after the costs to develop the series have been amortized through the income statement. The basic economic dynamics of the pricing power and growth/maintenance costs of each business - distribution and content - make the latter a far more valuable asset in the long run. To that end, I expect that over the next several years that the distribution side of the house (data access) will continue to become a commoditized service facing pricing pressure and ultimately could lead to significant M&A (similar to Verizon/AOL) as proprietary content is viewed as the real value-added service. Network operators are essentially being relegated to becoming regulated utilities, basically dumb pipes for data access. And now Netflix and other content aggregators/owners don't need to worry about data throttling or other leverage tactics from regulated telecoms after the FCC net neutrality decision. There are three key differences between YouTube and Netflix: (1) the revenue model (YouTube is mostly ad-based; Netflix sports a subscription revenue model); (2) subscriber counts (YouTube has over 1 billion users relative to Netflix's 65 million subscribers); and (3) the type/quality of content available on each platform (YouTube is mostly clip-based/amateur content [admittedly evolving to more professional content], Netflix is high-quality original and/or licensed content). In my view, the most important differences which suggest a much higher market cap for Netflix over the coming decade are that it has a much longer runway for growth relative to YouTube (1 billion active users versus 65 million subscribers) and that Netflix offers consumers the best street-level value proposition. When coupled with the visible, high-margin recurring revenue stream from the subscription model, Netflix is also less risky than YouTube given potential volatility in pricing dynamics of video ads. In addition, although YouTube grew 60% YoY in Q2, it reportedly operates at breakeven with 1 billion users which indicates the video ad model might not be as scalable or valuable as the Netflix platform which is already generating profits and cash (when viewed over a longer horizon) despite large investments in proprietary content. My valuation premise for YouTube and Netflix is based on what strategic players would pay to own the asset AND the valuation premium that would be applied to keep the asset out of the hands of competitors in an auction format. A 40% premium to Netflix's $45 billion market cap suggests a ~$60 billion takeout price, or about a 10x TTM sales multiple today. For comparison purposes, Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) acquired YouTube nearly a decade ago for $1.65 billion, reportedly paying a $1 billion premium to what then CEO Eric Schmidt thought YouTube was then worth. Mr. Schmidt admitted that Google paid a ~150% premium to avoid losing YouTube to a competitor and, in the meantime, scored itself a 50x bagger in under 10 years (based on Bank of America's valuation) showing the power of a scalable platform model. For that reason, valuing a platform model with Netflix's characteristics - the #1 player in a massive addressable market with an enviable moat and multiple growth drivers - on a DCF basis is nearly futile. A better valuation approach is to reasonably estimate what a strategic buyer would pay to acquire the entire business today. My guess is any number of large tech players who are building content ecosystems would pay up to 10x TTM revenue for Netflix given the long tarmac of growth ahead of it. Reputed VC investor Marc Andreesen thinks Netflix could have 1 billion subscribers by the early 2020s! I don't know about that estimate, but if Netflix scales to 200 million subscribers in that time frame (20 million subscribers per year for 7 years going out to 2022 puts Netflix around 200 million subscribers), a $60 billion purchase price today would be a song for an acquirer. There are a number of growth levers for Netflix to become a $100 billion+ market cap company in time, primarily through increasing subscriber counts and/or through exercising its pricing power via a small price increase when subscriber count growth slows. For example, a $2 price increase per month on 200 million subscribers would essentially all drop to the bottom line (assuming stable churn), leading to an additional $4.8 billion per year in operating income. That is some serious, rip-your-face-off earnings leverage short sellers should avoid betting against, and exactly the type of business long-term value-oriented investors should own: a category dominator, asset-light platform model with an unbeatable street-level value proposition and untapped pricing power run by proven operators with a focus on long-term value creation. And investors should salivate when they imagine what Netflix looks like 5+ years out, asking themselves: what is next? Live sports? In-app e-commerce purchases? There a plenty of ways to continue to monetize the subscriber base as Netflix matures and offers new services down the road. Sometimes there is value where everyone else thinks an asset is expensive. As a disruptor, Netflix seems to fit that criteria quite well. Source: If YouTube Is Valued At $80 Billion, How Much Is Netflix Worth?
