Microsoft: Bringing Windows 10, Universal Apps To Vehicle Infotainment Would Change Everything - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha The Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Universal Windows Platform app is a Windows experience that is built upon the Universal Windows Platform (UWP). At the core of UWP apps is the idea that users want their experiences to be mobile across ALL their devices, and they want to use whatever device is most convenient or productive for the task at hand. Windows 10 makes it easy to develop apps for one store to reach all Windows 10 devices - PC, tablet, phone and more. It's easier to support a number of screen sizes, and also a variety of interaction models, whether it be touch, mouse & keyboard, a game controller or a pen. Currently, we have vehicle infotainment, which is functionally rich, but shares virtually no common interface elements across vehicle manufacturers, and sometimes across models within that same manufacturer. Imagine if Dell computers had an operating system just as complete and feature rich as HP computers, yet the interfaces were entirely different. You'll notice hardware wise, these two systems are really quite different. But that's just the start of it. Once you start interacting with these two infotainment systems, you quickly find they share nothing in common even though all the functions you are trying to carry out are common to most all vehicles: entering an address in the navigation system, pairing a smartphone, etc. I have been a software architect for 3+ decades, and inconsistent user interfaces just bother me. It's like the "File/Save" issues we computer users had to deal with in the early eighties when no two apps could agree on how you save the file you're working on. Finally though, a few companies got together and defined the Common User Interface Guidelines. These guidelines defined the interface elements that most applications shared, i.e., where File/Save is, where the Help menu is, etc. The beauty of these guidelines is that anyone could sit down at anyone else's computer, and even though a particular app might be unfamiliar, you could always get around with relative ease. Why can't vehicle infotainment be so standardized? Why can't there be a standardization of how addresses are entered or phones paired? The vehicle infotainment market is currently dominated by BlackBerry's (NASDAQ: BBRY ) QNX CAR Platform for Infotainment , which underlies the veneer that the vehicle manufacturer places on top. Even though QNX provides rich functionality, it does little in the way of defining a common user interface. Car manufacturers seem to just build whatever user interface model they deem appropriate at the time. It is now time for Microsoft to take infotainment under the Windows 10 umbrella by replacing the incumbent operating systems in their entirety and introducing the driver to the benefits of Microsoft's Universal Apps Strategy. (We'll just ignore Microsoft's first stab at automotive with Windows Embedded Automotive .) Auto manufactures could still customize the infotainment experience with apps, much like Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) or AT&T (NYSE: T ) do today on a smartphone. Likely Windows 10 for infotainment would be near free for the auto manufacturers like it is today for the array of other Windows 10-supported devices. The big money to be made will be in a whole new genre of infotainment focused apps on the Microsoft apps store. Of course all apps would have specialized permissions, security, and safety features that would prevent certain apps from running unless the vehicle is in 'Park'. (Like video playback or hands-on-display intensive apps.) Infotainment would drive voice-operated apps to a whole new level. Cortana for instance would be tasked with reading your emails or selecting music for you to play. Cortana would also be your navigation sweetheart; giving directions, and understanding commands to avoid freeways, or canceling the route. There would be many new industry specific apps too. Uber (Pending: UBER ) for instance could have in-dash apps for drivers. Locale specific entertainment apps would likely be popular as well. But infotainment apps would not be limited to 'while you're driving' apps. I would love to read the news or emails in a format larger than my smartphone if I'm say parked at the dentist office while my kid gets his teeth cleaned. The infotainment display is also a reasonable display to watch a movie on or YouTube video. Should Microsoft own this space? No, of course not. I fully expect Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) to also pitch their infotainment systems 'reinvented' to the car manufacturers. I expect Apple will build a beautiful infotainment OS, one that extends their walled garden right out the street. But Microsoft is in the best position to set the bar for this space, largely due to the portability and design philosophy of Windows 10 and Universal Apps, i.e., apps built for the PC will run on smartphones, tablets, infotainment systems, XBox and laptops. Car manufactures will still have some reasonable leeway in designing beautiful user interface hardware, but they will need to offer the infotainment OS on some sort of portable media like an SD Card so that the customer can pick the preferred OS just like they would pick interior color or whether it's a hybrid. There is a lot to like about the new Microsoft, but I especially like Windows 10, Universal Apps, and Continuum and feel they will have an increasingly important role over the next several years. I believe the Windows 10-powered infotainment systems will be a reality as will similar offerings by both Apple and Google. This new market should act as a positive price catalyst for all three, but especially for Microsoft as it's already got the 'harmonic convergence of devices' model up and running.
