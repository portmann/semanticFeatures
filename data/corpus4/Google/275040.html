Disney's Shares To Outperform Over Next Few Quarters - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Disney has demonstrated its ability to monetize its characters and franchises across multiple platforms. Disney's shares remain attractive given the company’s growth profile and unparalleled ability to monetize IP over the long-term across its divisions. Disney is expected to achieve core domestic Parks margin expansion and strong OI contribution from Star Wars franchise while its Consumer products business is expected to significantly benefit in FY2016. Walt Disney is a diversified media company and makes money through several businesses including cable networks, broadcasting network, theme parks & hotels, filmed entertainment and consumer products. Its cable networks include channels such as ESPN, the Disney Channel, ABC Family & others. Disney's broadcasting arm, ABC Network is one of the biggest broadcasting networks in the U.S. with a wide viewership. Disney have several theme parks and resorts that attract millions of visitors every year and it leverages its famous characters and brands to sell a variety of merchandise. Its filmed entertainment unit produces and distributes movies under Disney Studios brand. Fundamentals (Financial year end 3rd Oct 2015) The crown jewel of Disney's media networks segment is ESPN as it dominates the domestic sports television with its 24-hour programming on ESPN, ESPN2 and its growing sister networks. ESPN has exclusive rights within both NFL and college football, the premier sports programming rights in the United States. ESPN profits from the highest affiliate fees per subscriber of any cable channel, and generates revenue from advertisers interested in reaching adult males ages 18-49, a key advertising demographic that watches less scripted television than other groups. This dual income stream is a significant advantage not shared by the broadcast networks, which rely primarily on ad revenue. ESPN and other cable channels are the most valuable divisions for the following reasons: High Cable & Satellite Operator Fees - Cable and satellite companies such Comcast, Time Warner Cable and DirecTV pay Disney to include its cable channels, such as ESPN, Disney Channel, ABC Family and others in their programming packages. These operators pay a handsome amount of fee for ESPN (~$5.05 per subscriber per month) and for Disney Channel (~$0.94 per subscriber per month). The high amount of fee charged along with high ad pricing that results in healthy ad revenues make ESPN and other cable networks most valuable to Disney High Penetration of Cable Networks - Along with high fee charged, Disney's cable networks such as ESPN and Disney Channel have high penetration. ESPN and Disney Channel are present in approximately 95% of the U.S. pay-TV households The parks and resorts segment has rebounded strongly from the recession and the opening of Disneyland Shanghai in 2016 expected to provide additional momentum. The addition of the Star Wars franchise broadens the demographics that the company can address Although making movies is a hit-or-miss business, Disney's large library of content with popular franchises and characters reduces this volatility over time Increasing Pay TV Competition - Competition in the Pay-TV space is also increasing with new entrants such as Google, Apple, Sony and Intel developing online pay-TV services. This can have adverse impact in affiliate revenues for big media companies like Disney Increasing sports programming costs- ESPN i ncreases its fee per subscriber every year, owing to rise in sports programming costs which has become a cause of worry for pay-TV service providers. Some of them can considering dropping ESPN from lower priced programming packages Declining DVDs and expanding streaming - As a result of growth of rental companies and online video, DVD sales have suffered declines in recent years causing worry to media companies such as Disney. However, these media companies are now pushing for rental window and licensing of their older content to recoup lost profits Disney Channel benefits from its attractive economics as its programming consists of internally generated hits with Disney's vast library of feature films and animated characters. Disney's other components rely on the world-class Disney brand which is sought after by children and trusted by parents. Disney has demonstrated its ability to monetize its characters and franchises across multiple platforms--movies, home video, merchandising, theme parks and even musicals. Disney's animated franchises will continue to grow as more popular movies get released by the animated studio and Pixar which has already generated hits such as Toy Story, Cars and most recently Frozen. Disney arranged the Marvel universe to create a series of interconnected films and product tie-ins similar to its animated franchises. With its acquisition of Lucasfilm , Disney appears to be positioning the Star Wars franchise in the same manner. Disney's theme parks and resorts are almost impossible to replicate, especially considering the tie-ins with its other business lines. Disney's financial health is solid as its debt is a low percentage of total capitalization and its EBITDA is expected to cover interest expense more than 30 times on average during the next five years. The company's debt/capital ratio hovers around 25% and its credit rating of A+ to Disney, implying minimal default risk.
