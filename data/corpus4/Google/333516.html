Microsoft Made A Game-Changing Acquisition - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha The Xamarin acquisition gives Microsoft a reentry point into an arena it was practically kicked out of. It will leverage the 1.3 million mobile app developers to offer other businesses the expertise and creativity it never could. Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) recent acquisition of Xamarin has the potential to totally transform the future course of Microsoft in line with its new mobile-first, cloud-first approach. The beauty of Xamarin is that, despite the differences under the hood, Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android (coupled with Microsoft's Windows Phone SDK) offer a seamless experience for writing C# code that can be re-used across all three platforms. Business logic, database usage, network access and other common functions can be written once and re-used on each platform, providing a foundation for platform-specific user interfaces that look and perform as native applications. - Xamarin To explain it in simpler terms, Xamarin tries to makes things easy for developers. Consider a business trying to develop an app for its users. It will have to create an app for iOS (Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) device users) as well as one for Android (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) users. The app itself is essentially the same thing, but the developer has to do it twice. Xamarin cuts through this (though not by 100%), thereby making the development cycle easier for the developers and a lot cheaper and faster for the companies. Microsoft's relationship with Xamarin goes back to 2013 when Microsoft introduced Xamarin as a global partner, at a time when the latter already had a community of 440,000 developers in 70 countries. In my earlier article on Microsoft's new vision, Microsoft: Buy Opportunities Coming Your Way , I spoke about how the company had managed to nearly kill Windows Phone by not taking the effort to build a developer community the way Apple and Google did. With the acquisition of Xamarin comes a new era for Microsoft, which can put its weight behind a company/community that will build apps for iOS, Android as well as its own Windows 10 Mobile in one go. Naturally, the first two operating systems will have priority on build, but Windows 10 wins in the process. When you offer any business the option of having a mobile app that will work on any Windows-driven device in addition to iOS and Android, they're not going to say no to it. Microsoft has so far left a big gap in its mobile strategy, but with this ready-to-use community of over 1.3 million developers and over 15,000 clients, I think it has got its foot in a door that was long closed to it because of the choices it made in the past. At least now there's a realistic chance for it to capture some market share where it has virtually none. This is its opportunity to crack the mobile code that has confounded it for so long. Although 15,000+ businesses may look like a drop in the ocean now, it's a significant addition to its arsenal - especially in an area that has so far been its weakest link. Moreover, all of these businesses are already in the market for mobile applications, which means they're ripe to be picked for cloud solutions as well, which Microsoft will surely start pushing them into. Yes, they were, but as partners, Xamarin's contribution was to work with Microsoft to give the latter's developers additional tools to develop Microsoft products. In the process, Xamarin benefited by being brought to the limelight because of their "global" partnership. That was the extent of their relationship. This time the equation is very different. Microsoft now owns all of Xamarin's resources - most importantly, the 1.3 million strong developer community that comes with it. Now is where Xamarin is bringing true value to Microsoft. What would have otherwise taken Microsoft years to build (along with high odds of failure) is now readily accessible because of the acquisition. Investor-speak: Why is This a Key Acquisition? To build any kind of community of skilled people - Apple being the one probable exception - you need to give and take. That's how Android's developer base was built; in fact, even Apple's developer community was built on the faith that a developer's work would be accessible to millions of people around the world. The Microsoft of old was a control freak and that's not the kind of company that can build a community that is popular and that tech-savvy people are eager to join - unless it were disproportionately incentivized in some way. Under Nadella, however, the company seems to be going in the opposite direction - and that's the need of the hour. Changing the direction of a $300 billion company is like doing a U-turn in a 1,500-foot-long oil tanker in rough seas. It takes the focused effort of all hands at their positions doing their utmost to make sure she doesn't keel over. From that perspective, this acquisition's impact is hugely disproportionate to its actual cost or current contribution to MSFT. Microsoft is finally going to be recognized as a serious contender in the mobile space, and that is critical to its mobile-first, cloud-first agenda that Nadella is pushing. As an investor, you should be looking at how Microsoft can enlarge its ability to compete in the enterprise mobile space as well as end user market for mobile applications. Again, right now it's a drop in the ocean, but you can be sure that Xamarin's contribution to the bottom line will make itself known over the next few years. I see MSFT as possibly offering a few - if not plenty of - earnings shocks as it transitions from device and systems building into mobile and cloud services. It is at the threshold so it's too early to tell, but the fact that it's at least at the threshold is something to be said for Nadella's acumen.
