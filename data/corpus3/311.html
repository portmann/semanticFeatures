American National Bankshares: 4.26% Yield With Fifth Consecutive Year Of TBV Growth - American National Bankshares, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMNB) | Seeking Alpha While the internals of its income statement look messy, the fundamentals of the bank appear solid enough to consider a long. AMNB has grown book value and TBV five years sequentially while maintaining a low charge-offs to average loans rate. AMNB is far from perfect, but with a surprisingly predictable trading range, low bet, and a 4.26% yield it's worth watching for a long position. American National Bankshares, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMNB ) has had a tough quarter so far that has followed up a tough 2014. However, being near a technical trading bottom I think shares of this mid-yielding Virginia/North Carolina bank are worth a look for a long position even if just for a swing trade. There are some reasons to hold this name into the mid-term if it can establish support soon but for now think of AMNB as strictly a trader: The fundamentals at AMNB closely resemble the chart, a mess. AMNB just reported its third consecutive full year of declining net interest income which trickled down to its third consecutive year of lower net income. It's not just that, the internals look unhealthy as well. Loan growth has been anemic as has deposit growth. To add the cherry on top AMNB just posted its highest efficiency ratio in the last 5 full years. I could go on about other metrics but why bother, my point is made. Yeah, we're not exactly outlining a gem here. But, for our risk we do get that healthy dividend and we do get a bank that has grown both its book value and its TBV 5 years sequentially, a bank that has decreased its non-performing assets to total asset ratio to five-year lows (46 bps), and a bank that has net charge-offs to average loans of just 7bps (surprisingly in line with T60M averages). How's that for confusion? So, you can clearly see that AMNB pays a hefty dividend to keep folks interested as it has historically managed to have zero operational consistency. For me, at least with the way the chart is setup and the fact that there doesn't appear to be a huge amount of risk on the loan book the dividend is good enough to hold my interest. Still, despite its troubles AMNB trades today at comparable levels to peers. I would think in my research that I would have found AMNB trading at a steep discount but I was left wanting: AMNB trades in line from a P/E and from a P/B standpoint. It also has substantially similar beta to peers which again I find highly unusual given the operational inconsistency. Regardless, don't come into an AMNB long position thinking you're buying value on a bottom tick. You just aren't. Watch the AMNB technicals for a hold of this bottom trend line. If it does hold give it look for a swing long that could turn into something more if you're willing to hold this for several quarters.
