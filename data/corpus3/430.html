Please use the comments to demonstrate your own ignorance, unfamiliarity with empirical data and lack of respect for scientific knowledge. Be sure to create straw men and argue against things I have neither said nor implied. If you could repeat previously discredited memes or steer the conversation into irrelevant, off topic discussions, it would be appreciated. Lastly, kindly forgo all civility in your discourse . . . you are, after all, anonymous. http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-11/ecb-chasing-own-tail-as-bond-rates-turn-negative-socgen-says So what happens when central banks run out of bonds to buy?  You know, that fast-approaching time when you have to pay such economic powerhouses as Italy and Portugal for the privilege of lending to them (how about that price discovery). Do they start buying equities directly?  At least, the ones that aren’t already doing so, either directly or indirectly.  And if so, how much bigger does the bubble grow?  Media P/Es of 30?  40? “…Saudi Arabia have since hit back, saying it “expresses its intense surprise and dismay” over international criticism. Blogger Badawi has already received 50 lashes in a public square in January but further rounds have been delayed after pressure from the international community…” http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/saudi-arabia-surprised-at-criticism-of-blogger-badawi-flogging-10094429.html Boenher needs to invite this Middle Eastern to talk to Congress too.  Saudi’s poll numbers would rise with Americans when we see a fiery speech full of anger and venom. Get John McCain to lead a task force into to protect Saudi Arabia. http://www.businessinsider.com/chinese-politicians-are-rich-2015-3 â€‹Their “Free market” â€‹culture is working great for everyone.  Not just the one percent who are all in in the legislature.They better get their workers focused on hatred of the Japanese.  Get the 99%ers to hate, that’s the secret.

That on-ramp is paved with corn and ethanol subsidies. No politician even dreaming about becoming president will support eliminating ethanol and corn subsidies. Cullen Roche has been having fun with economists who “proved” that negative interest rates could not drop below storage costs, such as safety deposit boxes. http://blog.yardeni.com/2015/03/almighty-dollar-risky-for-us-except.html Simply end the Reagan loophole that lets companies hide foreign earnings by paying one-two percent tax in offshore tax havens and MAKE them bring home the money, fully-taxed as it should be Government revenues spike, more money here to invest. And it’s all dollars. Pay it all out in dividends to American shareholders if you want.  Where it will be taxed again and 15% and spent at Tiffany’s. Overseas taxpayers have to pay tax on their income, whether repatriated or not.  Shouldn’t corporations be held to at least the standard we impose on individual taxpayers? I went to see Macfarland USA at the theater. Anybody who eats fruits and vegetables should see it to get a better feel for how they get to our table. After seeing it, I did a bit more research into the backstory of the movie and its community. As usual, they made up much of the backstory for the coach but it appears they underplayed how poor and transitory the community actually is. What the coach was able to do to help a few students out of poverty is truly impressive. http://www.businessinsider.com/texas-lawmakers-sign-identifies-him-as-a-former-fetus-2015-3 The “End Times” folks in the American heartland have nothing on the Chinese government. The Chinese government. can actually control the afterlife and decide whether or not someone will reincarnate. I am surprised that they are focusing these powers on the reincarnation of the not-dead Dalai Lama instead of trying to get Mao-Tse-Tung back from the dead. WASHINGTON – The number of Americans who live in a household with at least one gun is lower than it’s ever been, according to a major American trend survey that finds the decline in gun ownership is paralleled by a reduction in the number of Americans who hunt. According to the latest General Social Survey, 32 percent of Americans either own a firearm themselves or live with someone who does, which ties a record low set in 2010. That’s a significant decline since the late 1970s and early 1980s, when about half of Americans told researchers there was a gun in their household. In the early morning hours of October 21st, 2014, Partap Davis lost $3,000. He had gone to sleep just after 2AM in his Albuquerque, New Mexico, home after a late night playing World of Tanks. While he slept, an attacker undid every online security protection he set up. By the time he woke up, most of his online life had been compromised: two email accounts, his phone, his Twitter, his two-factor authenticator, and most importantly, his bitcoin wallets. Davis was careful when it came to digital security. He chose strong passwords and didn’t click on bogus links. He used two-factor authentication with Gmail, so when he logged in from a new computer, he had to type in six digits that were texted to his phone, just to make sure it was him. He had made some money with the rise of bitcoin and held onto the bitcoin in three protected wallets, managed by Coinbase, Bitstamp, and BTC-E. He also used two-factor with the Coinbase and BTC-E accounts. Any time he wanted to access them, he had to verify the login with Authy, a two-factor authenticator app on his phone. Other than the bitcoin, Davis wasn’t that different from the average web user. He makes his living coding, splitting time between building video education software and a patchwork of other jobs. On the weekends, he snowboards, exploring the slopes around Los Alamos. This is his 10th year in Albuquerque; last year, he turned 40. which has become the norm. there really is very little that we every day users can do any more as most hackers are after the companies with the data. cause they can compromise a lot ids that way. That past â€” and journalists’ failures to reckon with it â€” are still affecting coverage today. When this email story broke, how many journalists said it was important because it “plays into a narrative” of Hillary Clinton as scandal-tainted? I must have heard it a dozen times just in the past week. Here’s a tip for my fellow scribes and opinionators: If you find yourself justifying blanket coverage of an issue because it “plays into a narrative,” stop right there. That’s a way of saying that you can’t come up with an actual, substantive reason this is important or newsworthy, just that it bears some superficial but probably meaningless similarity to something that happened at some point in the past. It’s the updated version of “out there” â€” during the Clinton years, reporters would say they had no choice but to devote attention to some scurrilous charge, whether there was evidence for it or not, because someone had made the charge and therefore it was “out there.” http://theweek.com/articles/543620/media-already-bungledhillarys-emailgate Besides the debt, demographics and deficits arguments (ie emerging markets are better credits than mature, high dependency ratio, falling or flat productivity environs), at least 50% of my portfolio, and my salary, is denominated in US thalers.  Way too much home country bias, IMO. Ritholtz has been observing capital markets with a critical eye for 20 years. With a background in math & sciences and a law school degree, he is not your typical Wall St. persona. He left Law for Finance, working as a trader, researcher and strategist before graduating to asset management "Go for a business that any idiot can run - because sooner or later, any idiot probably is going to run it." -Peter Lynch
