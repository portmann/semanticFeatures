Senate Finance Committee Chairman Seeks More Details on Fed Leak Probe - Real Time Economics - WSJ Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R., Utah) has asked the Federal Reserve to release more information about its internal investigation of an alleged information leak in 2012. In a letter to Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen on Wednesday, Mr. Hatch accused the Fed of hiding behind monetary-policy deliberations to conceal potentially embarrassing details about how officials may have allowed market-moving information to be leaked to outsiders. â€œIn the interest of transparency, I request that you provide to me results of the [Fed] boardâ€™s internal investigation into the breach of information security,â€? Mr. Hatch said in his letter. â€œThe notion that the [Fed] can cloak any information that it pleases and shield it from transparency and accountability is unacceptable,â€? he said. Mr. Hatchâ€™s letter follows demands by two Democratic senators to obtain more information about the investigation.
