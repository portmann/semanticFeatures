How much of a drag on growth is a strong U.S. dollar?  How good is a weak euro? by Tyler Cowen on March 12, 2015            at 1:34 pm               in  Economics , Uncategorized  | Permalink Scott Sumner says much of what I would, namely don’t reason from a price change .Â  I would make a related point, but in reverse, about the now-weaker euro.Â  Yes, it does in the short run help the eurozone exporters and thus the eurozone economies.Â  But it also makes imports more expensive, all the more in the longer run as the exchange rate pass-through effect on domestic import prices holds more fully.Â  Even in the short run, it makes the citizenry less wealthy as measured in other currency units of account, at least assuming that people and institutions in the eurozone are holding a disproportionate share of euros, a plausible assumption. All in all, the weaker euro is likely to prove a net benefit to the eurozone, all the more so if monetary policy can drum up some expansionary domestic benefits above and beyond the exchange rate effect.Â  Still, if you deliberately engineer a depreciation of your currency out of weakness and desperation, the long-run benefits usually don’t match up to that immediate feeling of short-run juice. Fx musing by economists…if Sumner and TC want to ‘bet on it’, Julian L. Simon style, they can buy Fx contracts.  But it’s well known predicting exchange rates based on macro data is nigh well impossible.   Or, ‘if you’re so smart, why aren’t you rich?’, though in Keynes and TCs case, and maybe even Sumner’s perhaps they are!?
