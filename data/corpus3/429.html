Time for Janet Yellen to Go On the Ellen DeGeneres Show | The Big Picture This week, theÂ  NBC/Wall Street Journal poll Â on presidential contenders for 2016 came out. It was the usual sort of thing: Favorable versus unfavorable ratings for the candidates: Democrats like Hillary; Republicans like Jeb (but not as much as Dems like Hillary); no one likes Chris Christie or Donald Trump. But you might have missed a fascinatingÂ  tidbit Â buried onÂ  Page 7 of the survey . Now I’m going to read you the names of several public figures, groups and organizations, and I’d like you to rate your feelings toward each one as very positive, somewhat positive, neutral, somewhat negative, or very negative. If you don’t know the name, please just say so. When it came to Â Federal Reserve Bank Chair Janet Yellen , an astonishing 70 percent of survey responses were â€œI donâ€™t know name/not sure.â€? Significant disagreement about what will happen when the Fed raises rates ? Please use the comments to demonstrate your own ignorance, unfamiliarity with empirical data and lack of respect for scientific knowledge. Be sure to create straw men and argue against things I have neither said nor implied. If you could repeat previously discredited memes or steer the conversation into irrelevant, off topic discussions, it would be appreciated. Lastly, kindly forgo all civility in your discourse . . . you are, after all, anonymous. People should not know who the Secretary of Agriculture is or who the Chair of the Fed is unless that is their business. Greenspan was a rock star and look where that got us. She should start with some selfies. Or just hang out with Paris Hilton at the bars.  Then move onto TV. Ritholtz has been observing capital markets with a critical eye for 20 years.
