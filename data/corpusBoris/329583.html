Brookfield Infrastructure Partners: You Can Sleep Well At Night With This One - Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. (NYSE:BIP) | Seeking Alpha Brookfield Infrastructure is diversified both globally and in its asset categories. It targets an annual average 12%-15% return on equity and 5-9% distribution increase. It is currently seeking long-term opportunities in distressed global markets. For the long-term investor, the company should offer steady growth and yield. It is a truism to say that investors should understand the companies they hold, and that they should have some faith in the macro conditions in which these companies operate. The Bermuda-based Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. (NYSE: BIP ) is an infrastructure holding company, part of the Brookfield Asset Management (NYSE: BAM ) family. But the term "infrastructure" can cover much, and it is worthwhile taking a look at the particulars of the company. In a volatile market, it is also important to consider the company's overall strategy. Brookfield Infrastructure, now eight years old in its present form, is clearly global in its footprint. Its February corporate presentation shows that only 10% of its holdings are North American. Europe and Australia each constitute 32% of its assets, and South America 26%. It has recently made an acquisition in India. networks over which energy, water, goods, people and data flow. In terms of the particular categories of its own various assets, transportation would account for 42%, utilities for 41%, energy infrastructure (transmission lines, pipelines, storage etc.; not energy itself) for 9%, and a more recent segment of communications infrastructure at 8%. The company's cash flow is intended for the most part to be predictable. Currently, some 46% comes from (usually long-term) contracts, 44% is regulated (normally including inflationary increases), and just 10% is categorized as other. They estimate that about 85% of EBITDA has no volume-related risk. Brookfield has the goal of achieving total returns in the range of 12%-15% per annum, and of growing its distribution annually by between 5% to 9%. Although BIP is a constant acquirer, and for larger projects can attract partnership capital through its parent company, it basically seeks to grow organically. Its policy, however is not a "buy and hold" one. It seeks to sell mature assets at profitable returns, and to use the proceeds to buy assets that will generate even higher returns. Obviously, it looks for high-quality assets with stable income flows; in the infrastructure sector, this is made both easier and harder by a scarcity factor. In terms of its distributions, it targets keeping payouts to between 60%-70% of free funds from operations. In conjunction with various partners, including the Qatar Investment Authority, Brookfield's Letter to Shareholders, indicates that it is hopeful about acquiring part or all of the Australian Asciano container port and rail complex, where it now holds almost 20% of the shares. (BIP's stake currently amounts to about $900 million. In fact, the Asciano board had backed the Brookfield August bid, but on February 16 switched its support to a competing bid from a Qube Logistics consortium. As a result the Brookfield partners earned an A$88 million (US$64) break fee. February 23, however, it was reported that Qube and Brookfield formally committed themselves to a A$9 billion joint offer, with a division of the assets that would better ensure regulatory approval from the Australian authorities. As reported, this would give Brookfield and Qube joint ownership of the port facilities and some of their foreign partners the railway components. This could not only avoid escalating competing bids. It could also avoid competition issues, since Brookfield already has Australian railway holdings. Brookfield's only comment thus far is to confirm its interest in a joint proposal, and to say that any current undertaking is non-binding. It obviously wants to acquire at least part of Asciano, but it made it clear that "we will remain disciplined and very patient." In 2015, Brookfield expanded its infrastructure footprint by acquiring telecommunications infrastructure in France, basically consisting of 7,000 rooftop towers and fiber links. BIP now has 10-year contracts with two mobile network operators for these facilities, and is looking both to purchase up to 15,000 more sites from the same operators, and/or to secure an arrangement with the French government to extend networks to rural areas. In North America, the company made two significant moves during the past year. It partnered with Kinder Morgan (NYSE: KMI ) to buy out the remainder of the Natural Gas Pipeline Company that the two did not own. They now each have a 50% stake. The cost to BIP was $106 million. It believes that here the prospects for growth this year are about 20%, with further growth to come. The company has indicated that it currently thinks there are real opportunities for the acquisition of energy infrastructure assets in the North American market. Presumably they are encouraged in this by producer sell-offs of non-core assets. They further note that 80% of 2016 revenue in this area is contracted, with an average term of seven years. In the energy area, Brookfield in 2015 participated in the buyout of Niska Gas Storage, with major facilities in Alberta, California and Oklahoma. BIP's New England energy transmission business was sold in August. In Canada, the company is in the process of divesting certain Ontario electricity transmission assets that it considers mature, with net proceeds of about C$220 million. Brookfield already has significant interests in Brazil, and it is viewing the current economic downturn there not as a problem, but as creating long-term opportunities, some of which it sees as "once in [a] lifetime" ones. These would include gas and electricity transmission, roads and rail. In 2016 Brookfield is proceeding with a $2 billion debottlenecking of its port in Santos, which is 70% complete. It has dropped its effort to acquire a 25% stake in Invepar, a Brazilian infrastructure company whose assets include the Rio Metro system and the SÃ£o Paulo Airport. However, it has participated in the funding of a $125 million loan to Invepar at an approximate 20% interest rate, repayable from any asset sales. Should these proceed, BIP feels that it is in a strong position to compete. While it recognizes the current economic difficulties in the country, management suggested in the Q4 conference call that there could be the beginning of a Brazilian recovery by 2017. In August, Brookfield Infrastructure made its first real incursion into Asia, acquiring, together with an Indian partner, a portfolio of six toll roads. The acquisition "provides us a great platform to participate in the Indian growth story over the long term," said a company spokesperson, indicating that further acquisitions there could well be possible. "It appears that the market outlook for 2016 will remain choppy," wrote CEO Sam Pollock in his letter to unitholders . In Brookfield's particular case, he was reflecting both the uncertainties of the global economic picture and the continued strength of the US dollar relative to other currencies (which exposure BIP partly hedges), which reduce the effect of the company's income from international sources. On the other hand, the CEO was positive. He said that the primary focus for the year would be to complete the transactions already announced. After that, the company had recognized a number of value-based opportunities in Brazil and in the US midstream on which it hope to capitalize. He emphasized the disconnect between the amount institutions and private equity seemed currently willing to pay for infrastructure with steady income streams and the valuations the market seemed to place on similar publicly-traded entities. This gave Brookfield an opportunity, on one hand, to sell some of its mature assets, and on the other hand to buy others at discounted rates. He put the current infrastructure disconnect in general terms at 30%-40%. Brookfield has just raised its current 2016 distribution to $0.57 per unit (now about 6.3%), an increase of about 7.5% over the 2015 distribution. Pollock saw no difficulty in maintaining this distribution, which represents an approximate 68% payout ratio. Brookfield has current liquidity of about $3 billion, and its current plans are to fund any future growth from existing sources. Brookfield Infrastructure sees itself as being involved for the long haul. Investors who would think of buying into it should probably have the same timeframe in mind. At the moment, it does present opportunity to those who would like to participate in an eventual global recovery from present economic conditions, given its anchor in infrastructure and stable returns with the diversity of its global exposure. Yet, it is not an "emerging markets" scenario. It has suffered somewhat currently from its perceived exposure to Brazil, but Brookfield sees that as an opportunity. Its track record has been good, both in terms of its ability to generate return on equity and distribution growth. Hopefully, it should be a "sleep well at night" investment.
