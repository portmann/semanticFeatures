BlackBerry: Expect Revenue Growth In Fiscal Year 2016 - BlackBerry Ltd. (NASDAQ:BBRY) | Seeking Alpha New phone offerings and software expansion should drive the company's first year-over-year annual revenue growth since fiscal year 2011. BlackBerry's cash balance will allow the company to pursue a significant acquisition in the software industry. I have confidence in management's turnaround strategy and now that the company is no longer facing insolvency, they can be patient as they grow the business. When John Chen took over as the Chief Executive Officer of BlackBerry Ltd. (NASDAQ: BBRY ) in November 2013 , he was handed a tough task of turning around a company seeing drastic revenue declines. Revenue has declined from a peak of $20 billion in 2011 to only $3.3 billion in 2015. Even more illustrative of the company's decline is the fact their global market share in an industry they once led is down to less than 1%. However, with the reporting of fourth-quarter operating, commitment to stabilizing revenue, and Chen's guidance that revenue is close to bottoming, the company might be poised for a breakout. In fiscal year 2015, the company introduced three new phones in the past year-the Leap, the Passport, and the Classic, and plans to introduce more units in fiscal year 2016 in an effort to steady device sales, while they build up their software business unit. The company is selling their smartphones at approximately $211 per smartphone and it accounted for 42 percent of the company's total revenue. Management estimates they will sell 10 million phones in fiscal year 2016, which could push smartphone revenue to approximately $2.1 billion for the year (assuming a stable per unit price). While I think 10 million phones is optimistic, I believe a fair conservative number is 7 million phones in fiscal year 2016, which puts smartphone revenue at approximately $1.48 billion (assuming a stable per unit price). By taking a conservative approach to the company's software revenue, estimating they will see similar software revenue in 2016 as they saw in 2015, software revenue could conservatively be expected to come in at $1.86 billion. Using these very conservative estimates, revenue would be approximately $3.34 billion, which would still be up from 2015. While this would result in a slight uptick for revenue in 2015, I believe it is possible for a larger revenue increase. The software business reported 24% quarter-over-quarter revenue growth and 20% year-over-year revenue growth for the fourth quarter of 2015. In addition, I think smartphone sales could easily beat my conservative estimate and believe it's possible for the price per unit to increase above the fiscal year 2015 number. Based on these factors, I expect overall revenue will increase in fiscal year 2015 for the first time since fiscal year 2011. This supports Chen's statement that revenue has bottomed and should see improvement going forward. The software improvement is due to the company expanding their device-management service to non-BlackBerry phones and expanding their software offerings and applications for business customers using Apple or Android products. Management expects more carriers to sign on and distribute BlackBerry devices and software, which is being confirmed through contract renewals with AT&T (NYSE: T ), Vodafone (NASDAQ: VOD ) and Sprint (NYSE: S ) who are picking up the company's software products in addition to their smartphone offerings. Management confirmed that they are seeing the best carrier retail support since the turnaround began. What might be the most important factor in the turnaround efforts is that the company has a lot of cash on hand - $3.27 billion to be exact, which surprisingly, matches the highest balance in company history. This cash balance is important as the company plans to make acquisitions to help boost their software revenues. Per Chen, he expects acquisitions to be the driver for the company reaching $500 million in quarterly software sales by next year. The company has shown their acquisition prowess when they acquired Secusmart in fiscal year 2015. Secusmart fits nicely into the company's portfolio of product offerings as it concentrates on adding security to smartphones, more specifically, anti-eavesdropping technology. A clear obstacle to the company making a big time acquisition is that with the market near all-time highs and software companies valued at high multiples, an acquisition is not going to come cheaply and they will likely have to pay a premium price. The software merger and acquisition market is a difficult space (see recent valuations of tech companies such as Snapchat and WhatsApp), but with BlackBerry seeing improvements in their current mix of products, they can be patient waiting for the right deal as they accumulate cash. With the company reporting an operating profit in fiscal year 2015, there should not be hurry for management to make a quick deal by buying an overpriced company. With Chen's turnaround plan starting to gain traction, the excitement over new software and smartphone offerings, and the potential for a future acquisition makes BlackBerry an exciting speculative buy. I believe the company has hit the bottom on their revenue descend and will see an increase beginning in fiscal year 2016. This improvement and cost cutting initiatives will allow them to see operating income growth, which will allow management to be patient in looking for an acquisition. Similar to the Secusmart, a future acquisition should fit into the company's current mission of adding security to the smartphone, which will further support Chen's decision to play nice with Apple and Android products by allowing their software and applications to be loaded onto their devices. Based on this, I think this might be one of the last chances to buy BlackBerry cheap as revenue stabilizes and starts to grow organically and inorganically. I'm not sure if revenues will be able to expand back to the $20 billion or if they do, how long it will take to get there, but I believe there is upside from the current share price. Given this optimism and my trust in Chen's management ability in a turnaround situation, I believe BlackBerry is a strong speculative buy.
