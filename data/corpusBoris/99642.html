Management guided fiscal 2016 revenue ahead of views and revenue growth may even accelerate in the second half of the year. iKang (NASDAQ: KANG ) went down following the fiscal Q4 results and I see no real reasons for the correction other than tradition. The stock has corrected almost every time after its earnings announcements since going public (see the annotated chart below) and I believe that the latest weakness represents a solid buying opportunity. The company is expanding its geographic footprint with new medical center openings and through acquisitions. The company also guided fiscal 2016 revenue ahead of views and the guidance is likely conservative given management remarks on the fiscal Q4 conference call. I am reiterating my view on iKang and expect the company to benefit from economic and health trends in China in the following years. iKang delivered a mixed fiscal Q4 report, with the non-GAAP EPS slightly missing analyst estimates and revenues $1 million ahead of views. The fiscal Q4 is seasonally the weakest quarter with a large gap in activity due to the timing of the Chinese New Year. The company always reports negative margins during fiscal Q4 and this quarter was no exception. Non-GAAP operating margin was negative 30% and the non-GAAP net margin was negative 20%, while the gross margin was down 100 basis points Y/Y to 18.7%. The fiscal 2016 revenue guidance was far more important than the fiscal Q4 report, and the company guided full-year revenue between $383 million and $390 million, representing a 32% to 34% increase over fiscal 2015. I think that the guidance is conservative and that there is room for the company to significantly outperform expectations in the following quarters. The main reason is the aggressive medical center expansion through new openings and acquisitions. The company plans to add 20 to 25 centers this year, and it is already more than half-way there with 14 new centers as of June 23. This growth was achieved with an acquisition of 11 centers through a 100% equity interest investment in Tianzhikangjian Investment Management and the acquisition of 2 medical centers in Yantai, marking the entry into the Shangdong province, which has a population close to 100 million. These centers will take some time to renovate and ramp up, but we should see some contribution in peak season in fiscal Q2 and Q3. The centers that were acquired in fiscal 2015 are also in a ramp-up stage and should have a stronger contribution to top line growth in fiscal 2016. The second reason to expect higher growth is management conservatism. CEO Li Zhang stated on the fiscal Q4 conference call that they "already have enough capacity to achieve the full-year target" and that the company has a solid deal pipeline which should result in reaching the center expansion plans early in the fiscal year. The additional centers will likely push the full-year revenue guidance higher in the following quarters and catalyze the share price. As a result, I expect fiscal 2016 revenue between $395 million and $405 million, which is $13 million above the management guidance at mid-point and the current analyst consensus of $387 million. Depending on the level of execution in existing and acquired centers and the timing of new acquisitions, the fiscal 2016 revenue could come in even above my estimate range. The third reason to expect the outperformance is new category expansion. The company has expanded the dental services to 25 centers and this will lead to more cross-selling opportunities in addition to disease screening. I wrote about the growth opportunities in dental services in my previous article , and if iKang's gains market share in a level similar to its current market share of the existing business, dental services should generate revenues between $80 million and $100 million based on the size of the market in 2013, and likely between $100 million and $150 million in three to four years, since dental services is a growing market. The dental services are still categorized as "other services", and have increased 95% Y/Y in fiscal 2015 to $26.2 million, and have significantly outgrown the disease screening and medical examinations revenue, which have increased 31% and 41% respectively in fiscal 2015. Since iKang provides dental services in just 25 centers out of 72, there is plenty of room for significant growth going forward, and I expect the "other services" category to significantly outperform in fiscal 2016 and beyond. The iKang Evergreen, which targets high-end clients should also ramp up beyond the three centers in Beijing, Nanjin and Guanghzhou in the following years and positively affect the ASPs. These centers are still in the early expansion phase and have pressured margins in the previous quarters, but they should be margin expansion drivers in the following years. These initiatives are a part of iKang's strategic transformation from a medical examination services company to a health management service company. Additional category expansion is also realistic and should further contribute to iKang's value proposition and further strengthen its leadership position in the following years. I stated in my previous article that iKang's revenues could reach $725 million by the end of 2018 if the company keeps its 12.3% market share in the preventive healthcare services market which should reach $5.9 billion in 2018, and this likely is a conservative estimate given the aggressive acquisition strategy and market share gains. iKang's revenue market share has increased from 12.3% in 2013 to 13.6% in 2014 and may exceed 15% by 2018. If the preventive healthcare services market grows as expected, iKang's revenue should be between $800 million and $900 million by the end of 2018. Assuming a conservative net margin of 13% to 15% (the non-GAAP net margin was 12.3% in fiscal 2015 and has room to expand given the fact that iKang is still in early stages of growth and focusing on top line growth), we get a net income range of $105 million to $135 million. Applying a P/E ratio of 20 to 25, which I believe is suitable given the expected long-term growth rates, we get a 2018 market cap range of $2.1 billion to $3.4 billion, compared to iKang's current market cap of $1.25 billion. This translates into long-term upside potential of 65% to 170% compared to the 40% near-term upside potential to my $27 price target. Expansion to tier 2 and 3 cities to hurt ASPs, expansion to negatively affect margins iKang is also on track with the expansion to tier 2 and tier 3 cities, which will likely have a negative effect on ASPs in the following quarters, while the aggressive acquisition strategy should also negatively affect margins. However, the overall trend in ASPs should continue to trend higher going forward based on regular price increases and iKang Evergreen. The increased competition may also lead to some pricing pressure, but iKang has premium pricing power over the closest competitors due to its higher quality equipment and higher overall quality of service. iKang management noted on the fiscal Q4 conference call that their closest competitor, Health 100, spends about RMB29 per person versus iKang's RMB69 per person and that iKang is focusing on mid to high-end market while Health 100 is focusing on the low-end market. The iKang Evergreen should also be a key differentiator going forward, as it focuses on bringing back the executives to have their check-ups in China rather than abroad, and it will most likely positively affect the demand going forward, especially considering the fact that these executives are likely to award iKang with a contract if they are satisfied with the Evergreen service. Therefore, I would not be surprised to see a slightly lower or flat ASP in the following quarters, and expect long-term ASPs to continue to trend higher. Margin pressure in the following quarters may negatively affect iKang's share price. The rapid expansion of medical centers will likely lead to higher costs and the newly acquired centers will not be meaningful top line contributors in the following quarters since they need renovation and time to ramp up. The higher costs and low contribution from newly acquired centers should be partially offset by a ramp up in the centers acquired last fiscal year as well as the expansion of dental services. This could lead to flat or even slightly higher margins, but I would not count on that this year. Flat or lower margins are likely this year and I expect margin expansion in fiscal 2017 and beyond as new centers, iKang Evergreen and dental services ramp up. iKang remains well positioned to benefit from the secular growth trends in China's preventive healthcare services market and I believe that it can continue to gain market share in the following years. I am reiterating my $27 price target, which translates into 40% upside from the current price, while the upside in the next three to four years might exceed 100%. Additional downside should be limited and I see strong support around $18 while the maximum downside should be limited to a forward P/E of 20 which was a very good area to add shares in the past couple of months. The traditional post-earnings selloff represents a solid buying opportunity and I believe that the reward/risk ratio is skewed to the long side. Higher than expected revenue growth and acquisition announcements should be the main catalysts for a higher share price in the following months.
