I?d now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Cliff Hudson, the Company's CEO. Mr. Hudson, you may begin. Thank you and thank all of you for joining us today. We appreciate your participation in our conference. We?re going to jump right into the sales information, David if you want to advance that. Very good fiscal year that we completed, August. Same-store sales of 7.3% for the fiscal year, so a nice strong year. It also marked the fifth consecutive year of positive same-store sales that we?ve experienced coming out of the recession. And we?ve also had positive same-store sales, you probably recall for 28 in the last 30 years. So really a very nice run for our brand and we continue with nice momentum in our business. The other good thing about this past fiscal year is we also saw good margin improvement in our company-owned drive-ins, about a 90 basis point improvement for the year and more to come in 2016. As the year progress, we also use the opportunity to repurchase stock of our Company. We spent a $124 million repurchasing shares and 7% of the outstanding company we?ve been able to buy through year-end. So on all measures from that standpoint really a very good year, one of which we?re very pleased with. David we can go to the next slide. I think we will talk about the quarter, which was also very positive quarter. As you know from the numbers you see now, on the quarter we had a 4.9% same-store sales growth. So again a very strong result for our system. That?s on when we consider that on a multiyear basis, 4.6% a year-ago in the fourth quarter and 5.9% in the quarter -- the same quarter a year before that, fiscal ?13. So roughly 5% three quarters, consecutive summer quarters, very nice growth in our business. And in the fourth quarter we saw 100 basis point margin improvement with our company stores, driven large part by the technology initiatives we?ve put in place, specifically the point of sales system at the store level. So impact on food and paper margin management in particular very positive. This also -- the combination of these elements top and bottom line improvement for the fourth quarter resulted in 26% increase in earnings per share quarter-over-quarter, ?15 over ?14. Later in the presentation Claudia is going to talk about guidance a little bit more, but with the momentum of our business and the fact that we?ve in the recent past with the share price being somewhat challenge, it?s given this opportunity to repurchase shares at faster rate that we would originally anticipated. And so guidance to you we?re increasing our guidance on the EPS growth range. But we had said earlier 14% to 18%, but instead now thinking more 16% to 20%.So our business continues to be strong across all day parts, very good momentum. We are very pleased with it and very optimistic about it moving forward. The next slide that you should have, we will continue to focus on the elements of our multi layer growth strategy and David I can go one slide before, our multi layer. There we go, you?ve got it. That?s it. our multi layer growth strategy, growth in same-store sales, improvement at operating leverage in our company stores, new store development, our ascending royalty rate and then finally use of cash flow. Over the last three years, we?ve had an average EPS growth rate of 23%. And that should add direct result of following the strategy. The multiple sales and profit driving strategies, our ascending royalty rate, and our repurchase program have yielded very good results for the last several years and I think we will continue to do so. This is the frame work through which we manage our business, it?s how we look at our business, we will continue to talk to you about our business. Now on Slide 7, as we think about how we continue moving the business, we talk to you for a long time about the flywheel that in our view does drive our business, working to drive traffic, drive sales, increase average unit volume and average unit profit for our operators all across the system. We have always thought of growing our franchisee sales and profits in the context of that flywheel with a series of initiatives that build one upon the other and generate solid business momentum. But more recently we kind of modified this in the way we present initiatives to our operators, our franchise operators, in particular, but also in the way we're talking about the business going forward. We modified our traditional flywheel to include our technology initiatives that complement our sales and profit initiatives and they?re designed to help us achieve a 2020 sales goal by $1.4 million -- excuse me, $1.5 million average unit volume by the end of the decade. I'll talk a little bit more about that later. But the series of the flywheel and the series of technology initiatives and social media initiatives that will be utilized in such a way to further differentiation versus our competition. But in the process driving traffic sales and profit for the average operator, these tie in nicely to the medium element you see in the flywheel in the red and should really help drive on their own help drive traffic sales and profitability for the average store, but then for the system help drive getting the word out about Sonic and continue in a more conventional way also to drive our business. There is no one initiative that will drive by itself, positive consistent same-store sales in isolation, but the series of product, media, and promotional strategy is designed to appeal the customers across different dayparts in markets can really fuel this virtuous cycle that we would had in place a number of years in the last decade and more, but also I think clearly coming into play now ?13, ?14 and ?15. And as you see technology is going to play an increasingly vital role in supporting this strategy going forward. Now David moving to the next slide, one thing to do, I want to talk a little bit more concretely about on this next slide is focusing on our strategic focus and outcome for our operators as we work to continue to build the business. The key goal was I mentioned a moment ago. When we talk to our operators about to the 2020 drive-in initiative, one of the key goals is to attain a $1.5 million AUV for the system. We have communicated this to our franchise operators over the last several years. So this is not a new concept to them. And as of the end of fiscal year 2015, August 2015, our average unit volume is 1.75 million. So we only need an average same-store sales increase of 3.7% over the next few years to achieve that $1.5 million AUV. Our view is that the goal is pretty achievable, not just because it?s a 3.5% I was talking about, but also because to give you further context, the top 20% of our system is already doing 1.9 million as it is. So our concept permits this kind of volume at the individual store level. So when we talk about that 2% to 4% comp, when we say as we gave a report last month to talk about the 2% to 4% comp, we stated previously -- stated it in such a way that aligns completely with what I?m talking about here needing a 3.7% comp and at being in that 2% to 4% range. Last month when we said 2% to 4% would yield an EPS growth rate of the high teens that we had give guidance for, some folks interpret that to mean that we?re slowing our same-store sales that we?re experiencing into this year. When in fact quarter to date same-store sales we are in fact above that 2% to 4% range, but we're early in the year and we got some tough comps coming ahead and so on and so forth. But the fact is we continue to be very optimistic about our business. We are very optimistic about work into that 1.5 AU -- million AUV as the decade progresses. So this is a big part of our business you see depicted there that 1.5 million AUV on the slide in blue. The green is the top 20% of our system at 1.9 million. So very achievable and very much a part of our focus. Now one of the things that?s going to drive that -- the next Slide David. One of the things that?s going to drive that continue -- has driven it in the past or continue to drive it prospectively, is our share of voice and the -- as we advertise how we look versus our competition. So you can see this change, this bump here in the last several years for us versus our competition. Really breaking away from some super regionals and starting to run along with -- some larger competitors. You see from ?12 to ?13 that's when we shifted to the national media, a big, big impact on our success. We increased appreciably then beginning in ?13 our share of voice by shifting from local to more national television. And we continue to narrow the gap with some of the companies in much larger footprint. It's really important to make the point here that the reallocation we made in 2013 continues to drive the brand and ad awareness. Some people I think have the view that that was a one year one benefit deal, but the impact of it in month 13 after the first year, the month 13 was bigger than month one. The impact in month 25 was bigger than one or 13. We?ve seen continued growth in fiscal year ?14 and ?15 and the impact has been very positive in our business. In addition to that, one of the things you should know, this is a qualitative thing, that the structure of our media fund that has permitted us to move this to a national medium or so, that same structure allows us the flexibility to leverage newer mediums that we would have difficulty accessing on a scale within our -- utilized with our prior structure and this gives us confidence that we will be able to continue and sustain the momentum that we have had in the recent past. Pictured on this slide is an indication of the ad awareness that we're achieving with a combination of the media we talk about on the prior slide and the creative that we?ve been utilizing now for a number of years brought back in 2012, leaving our two guys creative. You can see that we?ve moved to the number two spot in ad awareness amongst our competition and this is -- I mean one is just wonderful to be there, but when you think about the ranking given the relatively smaller size of our marketing budget versus some of these larger competitors sometimes spending four and five times what we spend, this is quite exceptional and I think in terms of our strategic placement of medium and the use of this creative. Our view is that this sustained investment in our brand and product awareness big -- will play a big role in our confidence going forward to continue to gain market share both as it relates to the share of voice, but more importantly the share of customers in our evolving landscape, in the expansion of our business. Now David, if you want to go over the next slide, another thing that has worked so well for us and will continue to work well for us has to do with our multi daypart strategy. This is one of the reasons why we can be so confident over multi-year basis looking forward of being able to differentiate ourselves versus our competition and see our way to gain share of our customers wallets and consumers wallets generally why we?ve been successful do in that past and why we believe we will continue to be so -- do so. More of our competitors play primarily at lunch and dinner with a narrow range of products, but we have a five daypart strategy and a diverse differentiated product portfolio that allows a lot of runway for growth and we continue to see significant opportunities in a variety of ways as an example like chicken where we?re innovating right now with exciting products like our boneless wings or items like ice cream with our Blastopia promotion and we will continue focusing on premium ice cream offerings that are offered at premium price and once again differentiate us versus our competition. We will also focus on our daypart, our breakfast daypart, as an opportunity for continued growth and in the coming months you will see more in different breakfast offerings than we?ve had historically or had previously. Now David the next slide, you can go ahead, some discussion about the technology in the business. In addition to all these initiative we laid out previously, the technology initiatives are one that we believe will have a very positive impact on the momentum of our brand going forward. And you can see depicted here what we refer to with our operators is our 2020 technology initiatives as well, 2020 drive-in that we?re implementing across the system. Right now we?ve POPS in the software based point of sale system in over 1,200 stores. This we continue to be confident with the rollout and couldn?t more excited about the future benefit existing, but future benefit of both programs. The POPS program continues to drive traffic and check with multiple daypart benefit, so just the POPS on the menu board and suggest the selling. This is a case even though we?re using it in its most rudimentary manner currently, because we see there is a lot of upside over the next several years. We?re excited about these initiatives as we continue to roll them out and its going to be ?16, ?17 before we get that done. But as we?re able to use our integrated customer engagement program which we call ICE, engaging the customer really in a differentiated fashion, different from what we?ve done historically, but also different from what our competition would do both on and off live. And our view is this is going to result not only as in a larger customer base, but more a loyal customer base as we?re able to do that. The next slide talks about the operating leverage for our brand and the performance of operating margins in the more recent past. So we?re pleased to report this 16.5% operating margin for SRI in fiscal year 2015 and we?ve the goal of moving that to 17.5% further down the line in fiscal 2016. And as you may know we share this goal with you in fiscal 2012, so we?re very pleased to now have reached the goal we said in 2012 having reached it in 2015. Claudia will provide more detail little later, but a substantial part of the margin improvement this year was a decline in food and packaging cost and that decline resulted at least in part, because the effective use of the -- of our inventory management tools in our new point of sales system. So this is something that makes us optimistic for our brand generally as we implement these systems across the Sonic system and our operators get the benefit of it. Now on the next slide you will see a discussion about new store development. Its new stores and relocation or rebuilds and you can extrapolate from that although I think we?ve depicted separately the resources that our operators are putting into development. So while we continue to perform well on sales and margin initiatives, our development execution has picked up and granted it?s been less consistent and little frustrating from that standpoint. But we have realigned some management, added some management, added some folks who have been with us in the past that have had enormously positive impact in this area. So we?re working hard to accelerate development across all markets and these changes I think we?ve made in December to that team are going to already having a positive impact and we will manifest more clearly to you down the line. What you see here is development over the last two years depicted on the slide and while the level of new unit development has not been as high as anticipated for fiscal ?15, the high number relocations should speak to you about the confidence our franchises have in the strength of our brand, saying that the combination of types of new stores, these are all conventional sign of drive-ins went from 54 in fiscal year ?14 to 71 and our guidance on this fiscal year new store development in the 50 to 60 range. So we see that side of our business continuing to pick up and our operators? confidence in our business growing as well. The next slide, David, I think will give the people on the line, on the phone a picture of what that investment -- the capital investment is now, its growing so nicely ?14, ?15 into ?16 -- the estimate for ?16. And its combination of new stores relocations, rebuilds, POPS and POS, you can see that what our operators across the system are being asked to invest and in fact are stepping up. So if you have any question about that I think you should not worry about that in terms of their confidence in the brand and their investment of the brand going forward. This is I think such a significant level of investment on their part, outstrips anything we?ve seen in a long, long time. It should not only show you the confidence which is my point a moment ago, but should have a very handsome payoff as these initiatives began paying off for our system and each and everyone of these initiatives are once that had very positive impact. On the next slide, you will see a depiction of the growth and commitments to build new stores and how those commitments have come along by fiscal year. 49 in 2012, we had nine in 2011, 49 to 79 fiscal year before last 2014, 115 commitments and then this past fiscal year 152. The pipeline is starting to build nicely and a very strong increase 32% incremental in the size of the pipeline increase year-over-year and we're very optimistic that we will grow even further this year, because the level of interest we're seeing in opening new stores where this core developing or new markets and it gives us the confidence that the growth can continue then for years to come. This combination of existing franchisees and those that are pleased with the brand and its performance and the income it?s generating for them are stepping up particularly in for markets with existing franchises. The new franchises, new markets, and existing franchises in developing markets are stepping forward as well. And we anticipate that the growing number of commitments then will reach a higher new number of openings this fiscal year as well as 2017 and beyond. And as I've said 50 to 60 new stores this year and then increasing in 2017. Now with that, I?m going to turn it over to Claudia San Pedro, our Chief Financial Officer, and let her pick it up from there. Claudia? We will now go over our fourth quarter financial results. And as Cliff mentioned, we?re very pleased to report a system-wide same-store sales increase of 4.9% for the fourth fiscal quarter and 7.3% on a fiscal year basis. What is especially nice about this performance is that it's been driven by a mix of traffic and check and the growth has been balanced across all of our dayparts which is in line with our multi-year strategy to achieve $1.5 million in averaging at volume for our drive-ins. Same-store sales at our company-owned drive-ins modestly trailed franchise drive-ins for the quarter and the year, though we had expected the opposite. Going forward, with more than 1,200 system drive-ins deployed on POPS, we do not believe comparing franchise versus company-owned comps will be a particularly accurate parameter of POPS impact. Particularly if we continue to lay on sales tool and functionality to be deployed every units over time, most importantly we continue to feel very optimistic about our IT initiatives playing a critical part in delivering on our sales goal for the year despite facing difficult comparisons in the first half. And as Cliff mentioned earlier, with respect to our range quarter to date, we?re above that range. Multiple internal initiatives drove strong margins in the quarter and the year. As we look at operating margins, they improved a 100 basis points to 23.1% in the fourth quarter leveraging strong sales and driving earnings per share growth of 26% to $0.43 on an adjusted basis as compared to $0.34 in the prior year. Effective inventory management tools and drive-in processes combined with lower commodity costs, delivered a 170 basis point decline in food and packaging costs. These tools and processes are part of our profit initiative associated with the new point of sale system that we?re rolling out currently to our franchise system. We expect to see continued favorability in this line item in fiscal 2016 driven by supply chain improvement, lower overall food cost inflation, and use of those effective of the inventory management tools, particularly in the first half of the fiscal year for ?16. Labor deteriorated by approximately 80 basis points of the percentage of sales, primarily as a result of higher bonuses for drive-in level partners exceeding their sales goals. We were pleased to see leverage from our investment and crew labor and believe these investments are important to make to retain quality talent as we continue to increase volumes and profits in our company drive-ins. As a reminder for fiscal year ?16, we?re reviewing our healthcare program and variable component of our bonus programs at our drive-in level management and above to ensure we have a program that benefits both our drive-in level management and our Company going forward. We?re comfortable and confident that we will be able to achieve the 75 to 125 basis points of improvement in company drive-in margins for fiscal 2016. The improvement will primarily come from reduced food and packaging costs, but we do also expect to see some leverage on the labor line. As Cliff mentioned previously, our franchisees saw substantial profit growth in 2015 and we expect them to continue to post record profit numbers in the year ahead. Their confidence is exemplified by their capital investment in our technology initiatives and in their investments in relocating rebuilding drive-ins and in new drive-ins. With respect to SG&A expenses, they were approximately $21.7 million this quarter compared to $18.9 million in the same period last year. This increase reflects our investment in headcount associated with bringing on the talent we need to support our technology initiatives over the next few years. We have invested in and will continue to invest in additional resources to support the successful implementation of these initiatives over the next few years, while we strive to keep pace with our growth in SG&A, we will also align it with the performance of our business. We expect minimal leverage on the SG&A line in the intermediate term. With respect to our tax rate, for the fourth quarter we reported a tax rate of 23.8%. This reflected some adjustments at the end of the year due to some current year tax credits that we were able to take advantage of. Going to the next slide and looking at our ascending royalty rate, as you hear us talk about this many times, we?re not only differentiated from a consumer perspective, but also from an investor perspective. What is unique about our brand is that under the terms of our license agreement, the royalty rate increases on incremental sales dollars. So as we increased average unit volumes and profitability for our franchises, we also see an increased royalty rate off of those incremental sales dollars. For fiscal year ?15 we saw 26 basis point increase in our effective royalty rate. The majority of the increase is attributable to a license conversion moving 900 drive-ins to a higher royalty rate structure. Going forward, the royalty rate will continue to increase primarily from organic same-store sales growth. And going to the next slide and looking at our capital structure, one of the advantages of having a strong franchise business model is we generate significant amounts of strong and predictable cash flow with only moderate capital needs in a typical year. This model gives us the flexibility to invest in our brand when initiatives meet our return on investment criteria, return cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, while we?re currently under our three times targeted debt level, we plan to issue debt in early calendar 2016 to fund ongoing share repurchases. We ended the quarter with $27.2 million in unrestricted cash and expect free cash flow to be in the $70 million to $80 million range in fiscal 2016. We define free cash flow as net income, depreciation, amortization expense and stock compensation expense less capital expenditures. This fiscal year we plan to repurchase $126 million of stock with $90 million of the previously announced $145 million authorization purchased in fiscal 2015. We now expect a disproportionate amount of the program to be completed in the fiscal first half. This higher than anticipated repurchase activity coupled with continued strong sales and operational performance, gives us the confidence to increase our projected EPS range from 14% to 18% to 16% to 20%. We also expect to pay a quarterly cash dividend of $0.11 per share. As for capital expenditures, we expect to spend $35 million to $40 million for fiscal 2016, reflecting continued investment in technology and support as we remain on track to have a 100% of the system of POPS and POS by the end of calendar year 2017. This guidance includes new company owned drive-ins, as well as several build to suit drive-ins that we build on behalf of franchisees that we will sell upon completion. Our free cash flow guidance does not assume we will sell any units to franchisees, though in fiscal 2015 we re-franchised a smaller market in Texas consisting of seven stores. Going forward, we will continue to evaluate opportunities as warranted on a store-by-store and market-by-market basis for re-franchising. So in summary, you can see from our fiscal year 2016 outlook on the next slide. We expect strong growth in same-store sales and margin improvement with solid momentum in our business and the implementation of several key initiatives. We expect these initiatives to drive earnings per share growth of approximately 16% to 20% in fiscal year ?15 over our adjusted earnings per share -- sorry, fiscal year ?16 over our adjusted earnings per share of $1.10 in 2015. These are based on the following assumptions; 2% to 4% same-store sales; 50 to 60 new franchised drive-in opening, driven-in margin improvement of 75 to 125 basis points primarily coming from declines in food and packaging, SG&A expense of $81.5 million to $82.5 million, depreciation expense of approximately $45.5 million to $46.5 million; net interest expense of $26.5 million to $27.5 million; capital expenditures of $35 million to $40 million and free cash flow was $70 million to $75 million with the tax rate between 36.5% and 37.5%. I think we?ve probably got some Q&A for a little while, but then I?ll offer some closing comments. So, operator, why don?t we open it up for Q&A and we?ll go from there. Thank you, Cliff and Claudia. Couple of just clarifications for my question, I was just curious, can you -- I was just doing the math through the reconciliation and the $1.7 million charge in the share count, it seemed to imply only $0.03 or so. Is there something that you?re doing there as far as or is there another charge that is helping you round down to $0.43 rather than $0.44 on a recurring basis? Well its, as a matter of fact what we found is due to around the error. What we do is we look at the entire fiscal year Matt, and so the quarter -- we make the quarter work to ensure that the fiscal year comes out online. Understood. I?m getting to your Bucktown [ph] also, okay but actually is $0.44 in this current quarter. But okay, can you just also comment on the $900,000 other income line in the fourth quarter. I mean I don?t recall a quarter where it?s been that high before. I was just curious what was that income? Sure. So that primarily relates to the gain on the sale of our seven company Drive-Ins and the small Texas market. Excellent. And then, can you -- since you did buyback the stock a little bit more aggressively and it helped you to boost your outlook. Can you give us a ballpark for the share count for the first quarter, what you think that should come in out so we have accurate models? We won't be providing that information. We will be providing it in January when we report our fiscal first quarter. So we -- is you can take, we are purchasing more aggressively as a result of the share price and we do anticipate getting to 16% or 20% earnings per share growth ? Okay. Last question you gave a lot of guidance on this or you gave some nice commentary about the quarterly day same store sales trends being above your two to four full year guidance. I was curios of you could comment on the year ago cadence. You obviously have a -- a harder compare in this quarter than what you just lapped when you reported fiscal 4Q. When do those harder compares if you could remind us kick-in? Well, we don?t ordinarily give intra quarter guidance nor do we give month-by-month breakdown, and the thought it being a little more explicit this time was to avoid the misunderstanding that appeared to come up from the discussion a month ago in our release of year-end sales numbers. So we?ll take about same store sales for the quarter from a quantitative standpoint when we release the quarter. Okay. I was just curious if you wanted us to interpret that as momentum knowing that there is an obviously harder year ago compare and you?re still holding a pretty good trend with where you were last quarter. I just wanted to understand if there was any abnormality we should look at as far as the year ago comparison? I don?t think there?s any abnormality per say, I think you should take the 8.5% is obviously with a good strong comp last year and that?s what we?re facing this year and we?re trending above that mean. We talked again about the company sales versus the franchise sales, I think we were all surprised that the company sales store sales were up less than the franchise sales given the POPS installations. So I know you mentioned just room entry use of POPS but maybe talk a little bit about that and did Texas come into play there or the company stores a few more than Texas and were sales weaker in that market? Okay, kind of deal with you in a couple of ways there, Joe. One is it relates to the Texas and the oil patch question which come up in the past, we are not seeing that being as general problem. The only place where you could say that some sales are so much sluggish and they?re still positive is in some select stores in select markets in West Texas. Those still have positive sales trends but Texas and Oklahoma generally we?re not seeing any material shift in business, we?re seeing our business being positive in all states, all day parts, ages of stores et cetera. So that?s why I say we?re not seeing material shifts, because it?s all positive. Now to answer your question then about SRI, so the answer is no, it?s not because it?s an oil patch play. They are positive and it?s a nice story, but there?s other thing?s that kind of -- we have a number of initiatives going on and other things kind of mask some of these things. So as an example the strongest comps we?ve had in the last couple of years have been in developing markets. Those had -- those came from a lower AUV when we shifted national media dollars and so they had moderate market penetration, so not significant market penetration but they had some presence that?s why we call them developing markets instead of new and with this national media in ?13, ?14 ?15 we have particularly in ?14 and ?15 it is those developing markets that have had this, as a market type they?ve had the strongest comps in the system. Now those are virtually all -- not all but virtually all franchise stores. So that gives you the one sense of why the picture is so much masked in terms of franchise stores getting stronger sales. In addition to that even in our core markets, there are more franchise stores that have POPS and POS, then there are company stores. So to the extent that its yielding benefit, okay now we?re not getting to big market, national market POP and core markets as big as we are in developing markets, but we?ve got our POPS implementation in core markets. So that?s a nice impacting core markets, trade risk wise, but also customer engagement in this rudimentary phase. But more franchise stores have POPS and POS than company stores in core markets and the national media piece very big impact on developing markets and comps in new markets. Now it strikes me Joe, that the bigger sign in terms of the impact of these initiatives that we can separate out our company stores from franchise because all these other initiatives its hard to say, they got sales only because of this and not because of that, but the company stores have seen really very good margin improvement in the last year and in the last summer, last summer quarter and the last year and that is a differentiator versus the system and it also -- we got ours earlier meaning the point of sales system and so we put a lot more talent against utilization of the new systems because it does require different management of the business and the consequence has been positive from a bottom line standpoint disproportionate to franchisees without the POS. So I think there is positive news there and there?s positive news across the board. The question really just becomes how positive is it in developing markets and some of these other factors kind of mask somewhat the benefit in company stores. Okay, that?s helpful. Claudia, if you achieve say the midpoint or if you take the eye point of view, if you associate on same store sales, what would the royalty rates be for fiscal ?16, how much of sight is there in that? So, I think the way to think about it, if we think about the 2% to 4% range, then the range of basis point increase in royalty rate could be anywhere from 4% to 7% -- 6% or 7% basis points Joe. So I would say for every percentage increase in same store sales one to two basis points increase in royalty rates. Does that help? Yes, that helps. Okay, and then just a question on the add awareness chart you showed, so is that on a national basis or at -- what is the kind of the context for that? Okay, good. So I had two questions, the first is on just strategy. Your tone on potential re-franchising company on stores was a bit more open on this call than I?ve noticed in the past. Is there a reason for that, that you kind of said that and what would drive you to do re-franchisings here, I guess give you the green light, like does the transaction have to be accretive to EPS or is there something else that work there? Well I think Brian, we would approach those on a store-by-store, market-by-market basis, and our motivation in this case had to do with some underperforming stores and a franchisee who was very desirous of picking them up, and so there was a match there. So I think in circumstances where in particular if there is some operational challenges with our company stores for one reason or another, if it makes sense with those stores or make sense with that market, if it makes sense with a franchisee who has an angle approaching it that we believe is positive for the brand in that market, then we?ll deal with that on a case-by-case basis and that?s pretty much how we?ll approach it. Okay. The second question is more operational, it?s really about 2016 guidance. Claudia, you said that you think you?ll be able to leverage the labor line in 2016. When you look at 2015, that line actually de-leveraged on a very strong 7% comp. So the question is, what's really changing in 2016 for you guys that?s going to cause you to get so much better on this line item in light of all the labor tightening challenges that we?re hearing across the industry? I think that?s a great question. So if you look at our labor line in our performance in fiscal ?15, we had two major items that occurred. One is that we had increasing healthcare cost and that adversely impacted margins by about 30, 35 basis points, and then we also had de-leveraging from the variable component primarily of our -- the bonuses we pay out. So we have -- we are working on one of those and we have worked on the other. We have worked on our healthcare program and we modified it to where we think that starting in calendar year 2016 we won't see the adverse impact, we want to see cost increases as high with respect to the variable component of our compensation program are currently in the process of working on that. So we think a combination of those two items combined with increasing store sales we?ll be able to see some leverage on the labor line. Thank you very much. I want to ask about the balance sheet first, and you mentioned taking out some additional debt to fund the acceleration and the share repurchases. I?m just curious if you decided on how high you?re comfortable taking your leverage ratio at this point to complete that? I think at this point we?re comfortable with the three times target level which we?ve been communicating to you Will. We?ll continue to evaluate it, we evaluate it every few months to look at the various conditions of the market, our business. So we will continue to take that approach. Got it. And then as far as the taxes go, I wanted to sort of get a clarification there. So there are clearly a lot of moving pieces in the period, so I wanted to make sure I understood it correctly. When I add back the onetime taxes in the period I?ve come up with a tax rate around 33% which is below the 36.5% that you had guided to. So I?m wondering if that number is right first of all and then if there is a possibility we can continue to see a lower tax rate into next year which should possibly benefit earnings further than what we saw then benefit in the fourth quarter. That is a good question. So actually the 33% is on and it is a little bit less because of some things that when you look at some of the items we were able to take advantage of this year with respect to tax credits. What's difficult to predict quite frankly is that if you go back to this time last year we had projected a higher tax rate and then in December Congress had passed the workers opportunity tax credit. So we were able to take advantage of that, and that really is one of the primary variables in our tax rate as we go forward. So, is there the opportunity that it could be lower than the 36.5% to 37.5%, yes depending on what happens at the congressional level with respect to a couple of tax credits, the workers opportunity tax credit being one of the big ones. Got it. That?s helpful. And one quick clarification if I could, on the trend that you mentioned running above 2% to 4%, was that at your company stores or were you referring to the system? Good afternoon. I?m going to try to ask Matt?s question a different way. Can you quantify how many shares you?ve purchased quarter-to-date and also could you give us a little bit more color on where you are in terms of your basket inflation, what?s locked in, this of that nature. And then finally, just a little bit more color on the competitive landscape? Thank you. Sure. So I will take the first two questions, Brett. So on the first question with respect to our quarter-to-date purchases, we generally do not share that information, it will be in the 10-Q we file and we can talk about it in our earnings release in January when we talk about the fiscal first quarter. What we feel comfortable telling you again is that we have -- we are purchasing a disproportionate high amount given where the share price is and so we?ll give you an exact number when we report out in a few months. With respect to the second question on our basket, I?m happy to talk about that. So clearly we?re in a state of the declining commodity cost, and as we look at over the year our -- its important to put into two contexts. So buying any product quality improvements we may have, we?re seeing in general commodity cost deflation in about negative low single digits. We have made a few improvements to our burger that we will be rolling out over the next few months and so that will add a little bit of cost. But even with that additional cost we?re looking at overall a very benign commodity cost environment for the fiscal year. As we look at beef prices, just to give you a little bit more color on an individual level, beef prices were a 100% locked in on all components of beef through December and we?re partially covered from January through April. The market continues to decline, so [indiscernible] continue to look at opportunities to be able to take advantage of that. On chicken we?re 100% locked through December, the market is also declining at a nice clip and we?re negotiating out as we look out for calendar year 2016. For diary we?re about a 100% covered through Marc, for ice cream and we?ve locked in a decrease of about 4% to 7% decreases across this fiscal year. What we do intend on seeing is that there will be a significant price decline year-over-year in the first fiscal quarter on cheese and we?re covered a 100% through December on that one. I think those are the big commodity cost items. Does that answer your question on those two? Then I suppose on the competitive landscape, it only gets more competitive and we?ve seen -- we?ve just seen some I think primarily one larger competitor not McDonald?s start to -- seem to pick up their game from a sales standpoint. But when we look across the horizon I mean, its not a whole lot different than it was 6, 12 months ago and that is it, fast casual taking a good deal more than food, casual dining -- convenient stores taking more of the snacking and the drinks, providing a little bit more morning and really challenge throughout the day, the low-end food, the cheaper food, the convenient stores taking away. So QSR, a challenge from above in the fast casual blow by the convenient stores, we think we?ve got a product line and day part strategy that allows us differentiation strategy, burger is not in our name and drinks a big part of their business. So we?re able to hold different strings, focus on day parts and product line to keep our business momentum going and we?re doing so. In the past year we finished all dayparts as breakfast lines [indiscernible] dinner and evening all dayparts were positive all year and every quarter. So our product pipeline is working, our promotional strategy is working. But a major competitor is getting their act back together, I don?t know how -- whether they?ll sustain it and these other industry segments will be more competitive I?m sure. And if you could just, one last question. What are you seeing in terms of wage rate inflation and your turnover ratio -- your turnover levels? At this point Brett, we?re not seeing any significant increase in wage rate inflation. What we have been working on over the past year and if you recall this goes back to about this time last year about November. What we have consciously done is made investments in our personal at the Drive-In level, because as we look towards meeting our multi-year goal of getting to that $1.5 million in AUV, we?ve recognized the fact that we need to invest in people. So we started that investment a year ago. We?ve been seeing improvements in turnover. We still think there?s opportunity for more and we?ll continue to monitor the situation. But at this point we?re not seeing at our company Drive-In any significant wage rate inflations. Thanks. Good evening. Could you talk a little bit about the franchise opening timelines? It tends to be 4Q heavy, but I think last fiscal year was 1Q and 4Q heavy. So where would you expect those stores to be opening by quarter predominantly and then how about company own development? Please. Yes, so with respect to new franchise Drive-In openings, I think you can -- it?s going to be pretty consistent Nicole, we tend to see more in the first quarter. But I would tell you for next year as I think you?ll see a little bit more open in the third quarter but still more heavily focused on our fourth fiscal quarter. And then with respect to company Drive-In development, you won't see us substantially pick up our pace in company Drive-In development with respect to new Drive-In openings. What we are going to be doing this year is we are investing more in re-locations and re-builds because we?ve seen a great return on that. We generally tend to see 25% to 30% increase in sales. So we?re strategically targeting a few of our company Drive-In locations to make those investments in. Does that answer your question? Sure. So currently we?re running about 3% pricing. We will be rolling over that in November but we anticipate for the entire fiscal year probably remaining in that 2.5% to 3% price level. Thanks. Can I just first follow-up on the competitive question, how important is your non-breakfast hour breakfast business. I think in the past you?ve broken it out obviously its relevant just given what McDonald?s is doing now? It is not material to our business at all. So I hear you saying outside breakfast hours, how much breakfast products, what does that make up of our business? And the answer is, not material at all. And so what I would offer John is that, for our consumer -- what we?ve found with our consumer is that, what's important to them is to be able to have choices and flexibility. So the fact that they can make their food to order, the fact that they can get breakfast throughout the day or get a cheese burger at breakfast time because that?s ? Interesting. Can you talk about development, I know Cliff you had said that was an area maybe of disappointment and as you look at 2016, what you?ve done, what changes you?ve made to affect better or greater development franchise development in the future. You also mentioned build to suite, normally sure how does that really fit into the equation. Did you see that as being a bigger factor in getting franchisee development or is that a fairly minor contributor. Can you talk about what changes you?ve made there? John, there are number of changes that we?ve made in the development department, but here?s what I would say about the -- say you?re talking about the disappointed with the numbers. We do anticipate that being corrected this year, but in the summer time we did make a change in the leadership of the area and brought into the area a Sonic veteran, he?s been with us almost 20 years and he oversaw that area for a number of years and was willing to step back in and which is wonderful for us. He has also restructured some of the real estate review processes and we?ve stepped up with some new talent construction over side whether its something we?re building or overseeing for a franchisee. We?ve also brought back in to the company some franchise sales talent that has been there and been very affective in the past and left us two or three years ago and we brought her back. So the combination of the team I think is a very strong combination and really even in that last month of the fiscal year getting new store commitments was augmented by having that team focused on getting this done. So we?re feeling very good about the team that?s there and much of the team is the team that has produced for us previously very successfully, they work well together and they know each other, they know our brand, they know our system. Now in addition to that, the thing that makes us in spite of the pipeline not really bursting through, if you add new -- if you add the -- rebuilds to it, the pipeline does look better in terms of productivity, but we need to do better in terms of purely new stores. New Sonic Drive-Ins are experiencing higher AUVs in the system and perhaps as importantly they?re experiencing because we?re in our third year this national media and that seem to be one of the biggest causes. They?re experiencing much higher sales retention than we?ve seen historically. So in our second year we?re seeing about 96% sales retention and we?re seeing $1.5 million AUV for stores that have been open more than 12 months. And so I?ll add that emphasis because in fact we?re on an upward trend but new stores open more than 12 months or about $1.5 million AUV and 96% retention of sales in their second year. So when you see that and you see what's happened to store level profitability in the last one, two and three years, then you see these higher sales levels and we?ve attempted to take some cost out of a new building. Now you start seeing that pipeline grow in terms of new people stepping up and signing up for new growth and then you see our talent that knows the system and knows the business and whether its sales, real-estate, construction or the leadership of the department, it?s a richer combination of people and processes and condition of the brand that is materially better than it was one year ago. So this is why I continue to be optimistic about it even as we didn?t do as well this past fiscal year as we needed to. And the build to suits, is that for you to put your capital in the system, and that?s something that?s going to be a major part of that such as the small add or ?? No, it?s just a small part of it, John. So what we?ve identified is, we identified some a combination of two situations; one, where we had perhaps an operator who wanted to be a franchisee in certain geographic locations where they were having challenges getting financing to get it off the ground. So it?s strategic for us to be able to invest it and then flip it over to them and the way we?ve structured those agreements, what's happened is -- so if you look at it we spent probably about $6 million to $8 million in capital expenditures in ?15 and it might be something similar in fiscal year ?16. What tends to happen is we?ll flip it over the operating interest, in some cases the franchisee is immediately able to get financing and so they buy us out immediately, and in a couple of other situations its been over six months and they buy us out and we structure the agreement. So it?s in their best interest to buy us out in the near-term. That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Hudson, I?d like to turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks. Okay. We appreciate all of you participating today. Hopefully you can continue to see the basis for our optimism whether it relates to our median products same store sales driving initiatives, our technology initiatives, our new signing new franchisees, existing franchisees or future development. Any aspect of our business we look like we were very confident and optimistic about it. We feel like we?re moving into a period of very robust growth for our brand. So I appreciate your participation today. We look forward to continue to talk to you about Sonic over the coming months and look forward to sharing good stories with you over time. Thanks so much. That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.
