Greece Leaving The Eurozone? The Boy Just Won't Stop Crying Wolf... | Seeking Alpha The prospect of a Greek exit will likely not have as big an impact as some might expect. A Greek exit will not alter the two main factors plaguing the eurozone currently - low GDP growth and deflation. With the latest IMF deadline having approached, Greece has made a €450 million loan repayment after speculation the country might be unable to keep up with its debt repayments, triggering yet another round of debates as to whether Greece will in fact stay part of the eurozone. Interestingly, the euro did not move much in light of the news on the morning of April 9, with the euro even depreciating somewhat against the US dollar: While markets were initially (and still are to an extent) nervous at the prospect of Greece leaving the eurozone, popular opinion has gradually become more divided. On the one hand, there are those who see a Greek exit as still being a big detriment to economic progress in Europe. On the other hand, some believe a Greek exit would not be that bad, and if an exit is going to happen then let's just get on with it. For instance, Warren Buffett recently remarked that a Greek exit may not be that bad for the euro, as it would reinforce the rules regarding fiscal deficits and increase discipline among the remaining members to stick more rigidly to the prescribed guidelines. In Buffett's words, "The Germans are not going to fund the Greeks forever." However, as we move forward, I argue that economic conditions in Europe no longer hinge on Greece to the extent they once did. Warren Buffett has already pointed out that the euro currency has had structural problems from the beginning and these are not going to simply disappear irrespective of whether Greece stays or leaves the eurozone. I have already pointed out that quantitative easing in Europe is failing to stimulate GDP growth as negative inflation takes hold in various European countries. This is not the case in the United States, as the Federal Reserve has signaled that rates will rise. Therefore, GDP growth and consumer spending remain higher than the eurozone in spite of presently low rates. Despite Germany bearing the brunt of lending to Greece to fund the country's bailout, Germany has not suffered economically. The country remains one of the best performers in the eurozone, with countries such as France having much lower GDP growth and deflationary trends. Problems in the euro area initially started out due to large fiscal deficits. Many core and peripheral countries have managed to get their fiscal houses in order. However, GDP still remains low since monetary policy has not been tailored towards the adequate management of price expectations. From this perspective, it would not make a difference if Greece stays or leaves the eurozone, as low GDP growth and deflationary trends would still persist - two factors that are unrelated to fiscal policy. Note that I do not necessarily have a political opinion on this, and I am in no way arguing for or against Greece leaving the euro. However, I do believe that the macroeconomic environment in Europe is changing to the extent that monetary policy has become a bigger concern than fiscal policy. I believe that irrespective of whether Greece stays or leaves the eurozone, current economic conditions are quite different to that of 2012, and the drivers of economic prosperity in Europe have fundamentally changed. In this context, whether Greece stays or leaves is immaterial at this point. Source: Greece Leaving The Eurozone? The Boy Just Won't Stop Crying Wolf...
