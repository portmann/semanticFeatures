I’d now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jim Dennedy, President and CEO. Please go ahead sir. Thank you, Vince, and good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining us on the call today to review our fiscal 2016 first quarter results. Joining me today is our Chief Financial Officer, Janine Seebeck. Before we get started, just a quick reminder that on the call today we’ll be discussing some non-GAAP metrics, primarily adjusted cash from operations, and adjusted EBITDA which eliminates the effect of restructuring and other items that are either non-cash or non-recurring. Reconciliations to GAAP metrics are provided in the financial section of the press release issued earlier today. Starting with a brief overview of our financial results, total net revenue for the first quarter was $27.5 million compared with total net revenue of $23.7 million in the comparable prior year period representing a 16% increase. As we have highlighted on prior calls, it is important to focus on recurring revenues, which are comprised of support, maintenance to subscription services, which reached a quarterly record of $14.9 million in the fiscal first quarter compared to $13.8 million for the same period of fiscal ‘15, an 8% improvement over the prior year period. Our subscription revenues increased 23% year-over-year and comprised 15.5% of total recurring revenues compared to 13.6% of total recurring revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. Gross margin was 60% in the fiscal 2016 first quarter, compared with 62% in the prior-year period. On a sequential basis, gross margin improved by 900 basis points from 51% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $1.2 million compared to an adjusted EBITDA of $500,000 in the same period last year. We had a net loss in the fiscal 2016 first quarter of $200,000 or a loss of $0.01 per diluted share which compares to a net loss of $2.2 million or a loss of $0.10 per diluted share in the prior year period. Janine will provide a more extensive review of our financial results including the income statement and balance sheet as well as our expectations for the balance of fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2015, we implemented several important changes to help us better align our business and strategic goals with the needs that the end markets we serve and to improve the value proposition to the customers in those markets. The changes we implemented favorably impacted our first quarter results for fiscal 2016. We experienced improved product revenue growth from our installed base, increased the number of new customers doing business with our company, experienced more multiple solution sales, sold more new rGuest platform based solutions and increased the percentage of subscription based sales in the current quarter versus the comparable prior year period. The trend in the business, reflect our emphasis on transitioning to a subscription based business model from a licensed and maintenance reliant business. We believe this transition will generate greater long-term value for shareholders through growth and higher margin recurring revenues. With respect to our sales force, we ended the first quarter of fiscal 2016 with 27 Codec [ph] carrying sales people, 13 of which are focused on new customer acquisition. Of our 27 sales people, 15 joined Agilysys within the last year and of the addition, all have been sales executives covering the hospitality industry, directly selling subscription solution for both. We expect to add approximately 10 additional sales executives in the balance of fiscal 2016. And our focus remains on adding executives that have direct subscription selling experience. We are making consistent progress towards our goals around simplifying our business, evolving our offering and delivering against the milestones of rGuest, our next-generation platform. The progress is evident and the number of new business wins, 45 in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, doubling the number of new business wins in the comparable prior year period. The markets and our customers recognize this by delivering peer deployment and support services, performance stability with key innovations and taking a leadership position in the effective use of power enabled solution specifically tailored towards the needs of the hospitality industry. Our new business wins have not only increased in number but they have also increased across a diverse array of solutions including InfoGenesis, Visual One, rGuest Pay, Eatec as well as the sectors in which our customers operate including casinos, hotels, resorts, restaurants and universities. Turning more specifically to each of our business sectors, starting with commercial and travel gaming. This sector represents over 50% of our total revenue. Agilysys is the market leader in both commercial and travel gaming. Our solutions address the needs of casinos operators better than competing solutions in the market. Our solutions address the importance of mobility to help operators better engage their guests. During the quarter, we announced that Croc's Casino Resort in Jacó, Costa Rica selected a comprehensive solution suite including systems for property management, Point-of Sales and inventory procurement to optimize efficiency and enhanced guest service throughout the new Vegas style luxury hotel condominium and casino. An existing gaming customer with 22 properties in eight states upgraded to the latest release of our Lodging Management System LMS while adding rGuest Pay to the portfolio solutions they use in their business. A new customer in El Paso, Texas, offering world-class live entertainment acquired a bundled solution including InfoGenesis, rGuest Pay, Analytics and IG Flex to deliver a comprehensive guest experience at this exciting new venue. In addition, we are very excited to announce the Akwesasne Mohawk Casino Resort in up-state New York as a new customer. They will be using our InfoGenesis and rGuest Pay solutions after switching from using a competitor’s Point-of-Sales solutions. In the hotels, resorts and cruise sector representing almost 28% of our revenue, we are confident that we have the right solution offering to help lodging operators achieve added scalability, operational efficiency, reduced technology footprint and expense, while providing their guests with more personalized services. New wins in the hotel, resort and cruise sector include, Heritage Hospitality in York, Pennsylvania, the owner of Heritage Hills Golf Resort, and Heritage Hotel, selected a comprehensive restaurant solutions package including both fixed and mobile Point-of-Sale requirement, comprehensive table management capabilities, payment processing and restaurant reservation that would easily integrate with this existing infrastructure to deliver rapid return on investment. Earlier in the quarter, Hotel Granduca, a boutique hotel in Austin, Texas which has received the exclusive, the leading hotels in the world designation, selected Visual One, InfoGenesis and Eatec to streamline operations and deliver exceptional guest service. Other new business wins within this sector include the world renowned Fisher Island Club in Florida. This world-class resort chose a suite of Agilysys Solutions to manage their property including InfoGenesis and InfoGenesis Flex and Visual One, including club membership, spa and sales and catering. As well as the Horizon Resort & Spa, a high-end Palm Springs boutique property, the Steve Hermann Hotel and member of the Lehmann Hotels in the world collection, they will be using both rGuest Stay and rGuest Pay. Recently Drury Hotels Company, which has been recognized with the JD Power North American Hotel Guest Satisfaction Study Award in its class for the tenth consecutive year, agreed to conduct a pilot evaluation of rGuest Stay at select Drury property. Planning a successful completion of the pilot, Drury intends to integrate rGuest Stay with rGuest Pay to deploy a seamless TMS and payment gateway solution. Drury Hotels operate over 130 hotels across 21 states under such brands as Drury Inn & Suites, Drury Inn, Drury Plaza Hotel and [indiscernible] by Drury as well as other hotels in the net price segment. We are very excited about our partnership with Drury Hotels and the impact our solutions can have on their business. In the foodservice management sector we are pleased to have engaged Samsung Semiconductor, a new InfoGenesis subscription service customer for their corporate cafeteria. And finally moving to Restaurants, University Stay & Healthcare or RUSH, we see continued new openings and an increased need for more sophisticated dining experience including online ordering and reservation, mobile service and a higher level of customer interaction. New businesses wins in this sector includes The Walker Inn, a high-end Los Angeles cocktail lounge that shows the rGuest suite to the streamline operations and enable the staff and management of The Walker Inn to provide superior service. More recently, Middlebury College and Middlebury Vermont selected Eatec, InfoGenesis and rGuest Pay to manage all their camp food service locations including three dining halls, retail operations as well as catering for campus-wide events and private functions. These customer wins illustrate our traditional products remain relevant in the marketplace while fully integrating with the rGuest platform based solution as we transition our complete solutions portfolio and customers to the rGuest platform. Customers have clearly embraced our vision and long-term strategy and we believe our ongoing product development work will allow customers to leverage their existing investments to enhance the guest experience over time. Fiscal first quarter of 2016 was a productive period on a product front as well, as we continue to evolve the scope and sophistication of our offering and prepare existing and new customers for the rGuest platform transition. We are confident we have the vision, strategy, reach, integration and the ability to execute, to meet the needs of the market and deliver on our business plan to grow shareholder value. We recently announced the general availability of InfoGenesis Point-of-Sale Version 4.4.7 and InfoGenesis Flex version 4.4.7, the latest versions of our industry leading Point-of-Sales software. These new versions include enhancement that boost efficiency, help to increase revenue and improve the guest experience, as well as delivery key integrations with rGuest Seat and rGuest Analyze. Our investment in the rGuest platform continues to experience success in bringing solutions to market, including rGuest Pay, rGuest Seat, rGuest Analyze and rGuest Stay. All these newly introduced solutions integrate with and leverage Agilysys and most non-Agilysys product. We expect the ongoing roll-out of our additional rGuest platform based solutions which is enhancement for rGuest Stay and rGuest Buy will help us address the evolving needs of the end-markets we serve and open new market opportunities as focused on growing our already strong market share in the gaming and managed foodservice verticals, while enabling us to expand our presence in the hotels, resorts and cruise and RUSH hospitality sectors. Our products have received recognition from industry thought leaders including the business intelligence group which recently named Agilysys as a 2015 Stratus Award Finalist for our groundbreaking mobile Point-of-Sales system InfoGenesis Flex.

We remain confident that we will continue to make consistent progress and see added growth in future period. We believe smartly investing in our people, our solutions and our customers is the most reliable way to create greater and lasting value for our shareholders. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to our CFO, Janine Seebeck, who’ll review our financial results before opening the lines for questions. Janine? Thanks Jim and good morning everyone. Our first quarter fiscal 2016 revenue was $27.5 million, a 16% increase compared to total net revenue of $23.7 million in the comparable prior year period. Looking at revenue in greater detail, products revenue increased $2.8 million or 45.6% primarily due to increased sales related to our on-premise proprietary solutions, which is consistent with our key initiative to increase market share as we continue on the path of launching our next generation rGuest platform. Professional services remained relatively flat compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2015. Support, maintenance and subscriptions revenues increased $1.1 million or 7.8% largely as a result of our continued focus on selling mostly perpetual and subscription based services. We are pleased to see the growth trends in our recurring revenues. Our efforts to focus on this high margin business led to quarterly record revenue of $14.9 million or 54% of our total net revenue for the first quarter. A vital part of recurring revenues are subscription based revenues which increased by 23% accounting for $2.3 million or 15.5% of recurring revenues compared to 13.6% of recurring revenues in the year ago period and 8.4% of total revenues compared to 7.9% in the year-ago period. Moving down to income statement, overall gross margins were 60% for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to 62% in the prior year period. The gross margin decline for the fiscal 2016 first quarter was a result of gross margin decreases across support, maintenance and subscription services as well as professional services which more than offset improvements and gross profit margins and products. Going forward, we expect fiscal 2016 overall gross margins will be consistent with fiscal 2015 levels in the high 50% range. Operating expenses which include product development, selling and marketing, general and administrative and depreciation expense increased by 6.1% to $16.4 million in the first quarter compared to the prior year period. As a percentage of net revenues, operating expenses were 60% for the first quarter versus 65% in the prior year period. As expected, product development expense remains at similar levels to fiscal 2015, increasing by 7% to $6.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to $5.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 as we continued investing in engineering resources and research and development initiatives. Going forward, we expect product development to be in the mid-20% range as a percentage of revenues through fiscal 2016 comparable to fiscal 2015 levels. Sales and marketing comp increased $600,000 or 15% in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2015, as we continued the previously announced implementation of our sales strategy to enable us to better service our customers and meet our long-term objective. G&A increased 1% for the fiscal first quarter of 2016 versus the prior year, reflecting our investment in operating personnel as we execute on strategic activities announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, including the ongoing efforts to streamline and rationalize our back-office processes. And regarding amortization of intangibles, we saw a decrease of $1.5 million or 83% in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2015 primarily due to a reduction in expenses related to assets becoming fully amortized and assets being replaced or impaired during fiscal 2015 including our internal ERP replacement project. This led to a net loss in the first quarter of $200,000 or a loss of $0.01 on a diluted share basis compared to a loss of $2.2 million or $0.10 per share per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, a marked improvement in our bottom line and proof that we are indeed improving the business and moving in the right direction. And on an adjusted basis, adjusted EBITDA was $1.2 million or 150% improvement versus $461,000 in adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow statement, cash and marketable securities as of June 30, 2015 totaled $66 million compared to $75.1 million at March 31, 2015. The decrease in cash reflects approximately $6 million in spend for our ongoing product development investment. As we continue to invest in the transition to a subscription business and the rGuest platform this year, we expect to end fiscal 2016 with more than $50 million in cash. As our next generation product development investment cycle nears its completion later this year, we expect to generate positive free cash flow for fiscal 2017 as we also benefit from growth and subscription services booking. And we will look to begin sharing bookings data with our investors to help further illustrate the progress that we are making. And we are pleased that net cash used in operations was $1.9 million, an improvement compared to net cash used in operations of $8.2 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2015. Adjusted for non-recurring items, net adjusted cash used by operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 was $1.6 million compared to $5.8 million in the prior year period. And in terms of NOLs, we currently have a $180 million on our books for which we can attribute a full valuation allowance and which will help us remain liable for just taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions along with minimal state taxes for the foreseeable future. With regard to our outlook for the balance of fiscal 2016, we now expect full year revenues of $106 million to $108 million which is a moderately higher expectation for year-over-year revenue growth compared to previous expectations of revenue to be slightly above fiscal 2015 revenues of $103.5 million. We expect that our higher revenue forecast will similar translate to expectations for higher adjusted EBITDA compared to the fiscal 2015 adjusted EBITDA of $1.2 million. We continue to expect that gross margins for fiscal 2016 will be consistent with full year fiscal 2015 levels in the high 50% range. In closing, we are pleased with the improvements across our business in the first quarter and with a solid start to the year, particularly around our ability to grow recurring revenue. In particular higher margins subscription revenues as well as new customer acquisition which doubled compared to the prior year. We are pleased with the consistent progress we are making. We continue to make against our priority to prudently manage working capital so that going forward we can further optimize operating cash flows and continue to strategically leverage our healthy balance sheet. Before taking your questions, I wanted to remind everyone that we will be hosting our Annual Analyst Day on Thursday, August 27, starting at 8:30 A.M. Eastern. This event will take place at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in New York, and will include presentations by Jim, our CTO Larry Steinberg, myself and other members of Agilysys management. It is a great opportunity to get further insight into our current business strategy and rGuest platform, including its go-to-market strategy and product roadmap. If you’re interested in attending and have not received an invitation, please contact our investor relations team via e-mail at agys@jcir.com , or by phone at 212-835-8500. So, you’ve signed up 45 new clients in the quarter, is there any indication of these clients will do a follow-on upgrades in the recent future such that additional modules are more hardware orders? Stan, that is the intent. When we signed these customers up, most of them acquired multiple solutions in the initial purchase. So for instance let’s say, in rGuest Stay, with an rGuest Pay or an InfoGenesis with a Pay, it is our intent that would then re-approach those folks to acquire let’s say the analytics product or the Seat product in any other addition. We don’t have necessarily pipeline activity that we disclosed at that level. But it is our intent to continue to up-sell them on other solutions as this solution they initially acquired the experience success with those. Okay. And along those lines, what drove product sales, was it replacement cycles by existing or was it really by new client sales? Most of that product sales in the first quarter were driven by existing customers and a product refresh cycle or harder refresh cycle. And is there a typical time period for product refreshes that you’re finding for your clients, 5 years, 7 years, how can we think about what typical replacement cycle for your clients? Not everybody operates on the same refresh cycle. We’ve had some operators using hardware for almost 7 years which is unusual. Most are in the three or five year replacement cycle. There are some things that are happening in the market, vis-à-vis the Microsoft Windows XP Support that are driving some changes in demand for hardware replacement in order to maintain PCI compliance with PCI standards that are going to be strengthened all the more in October when E&P comes in. So, some of the product sales in this period are driven by some of that activity and others are sort of more natural hardware refresh cycle. Got it, got it. So, hospitality industry it’s obviously very fragmented looking at your client base about half year sales coming from maintenance. Can you give us an understanding of the opportunity you’re seeing to up-sell rGuest to the existing client base? Well, as we indicated through a couple of examples on the call today when customers have upgraded say Lodging Management for Visual One to the latest release, they are undertaking an evaluation of our payment solution product. And many have valued that payment solution product when they’ve made the upgrade to the next version of LMS or the next version of Visual One are also taking the rGuest Pay component with it. When we have been successful in either up-selling or displacing a competitor to the latest version of InfoGenesis, we have the opportunity not just rGuest Pay but also Analytics and Seed as well. So, those up-sells are happening. However the Pay, Seat and Analytics products are all subscription services base, none of them are offered as a licensed business model with our customers. And while we’re experiencing that success, the incremental revenue that’s recognized in any period is going to be smaller than you might anticipate from our product sale. Right. And what kind of lift to sales are you seeing on a percentage basis, as you make these upgrades? On a total contract value basis, it’s easy to express. And we talked about a customer last period that was an InfoGenesis licensed customer that migrated to an InfoGenesis subscription arrangement with us, and so, doing also added rGuest Pay and Analyze to their order. They were approximately $40,000 a year maintenance paying customer. And through the convergence to a subscription, and adding two new solutions to their portfolio, they’re now approximately an $85,000 a year subscription paying customer. The deal size on a contact value basis was a five-year deal. That’s fairly typical. Okay. And now that you’re going to market with rGuest platform, can you tell us what competing platforms or clients are considering and maybe why they have opted to go with rGuest? I think I’m happy to talk about competing solutions, the competitors in the marketplace that we see on a regular basis with the good friends over In-Four [ph], we also see the bulks at Oracle-Micros, the PAR Springer-Miller, HBO product we see on a pretty regular basis. We hear feedback on our products that they have, it’s easier to use. It’s easier to deploy. But I think the thing we’re hearing most from that installed base with the customers we’re making that selection is that we’re an easier company with which to do business both from engineering services, professional services and corporate services. So it’s not just a feature step-buy, it’s more of a relationship buy between the two companies. And that’s the level at which I think we’re winning while the product is itself competitive. Great, great. And just a final question, I know Janine just touched base on this, talking about product development and that R&D will probably be in the mid-20% range as a percent of sales. I guess, I just want to know how we should go about looking at this, with rGuest already been developed for them most part, are you guys targeting a certain amount of spend and therefore it comes out to be 20% of sales or do we expect the absolute figure to scale up and kind of remain 20% of sales increase? So, Stan, for fiscal 16 I think what we’re talking through is it’s about 25% of sales. Obviously as we move towards the rGuest platform we’re still managing in-market and rGuest. And I think as we get to better scale, you’re going to see the dollar start to kind of level out. But I think that this year is still that investment to get to that 25% and then you’ll start to see it trend down as a percentage of revenue as we look into that period. Yes, no worries. One more question on the 45 new customers you signed up. Can you talk a bit about the distribution of sales between the product sales, license verses the subscription? We can, I’ve got some numbers here in front of me, so I want to sort of run through in a little bit granular detail. The 45 new customers, 23 of those signed on as subscription services and 22 signed on as licensed customers of the new in the 45. Okay, great. With, just to get an idea of what type of systems you’re replacing at the Canary, you mentioned that you did replace a system. Are you able to comment on what system you were able to replace specifically? I know that’s extreme granularity there, I’m sorry. Yes, we prefer not to discuss the systems we’re replacing. When we talk to our customers about they used their names in our earnings release, we’re very delicate to understand it. We just want to say that they selected us. And that’s about it. We don’t want to attribute the reasons for why and we want to be respectful of our customers’ wishes on that basis. But we have indicated to them that we would say it was a competitive replacement, we’re just not going say who. Got it, no, no, I understand that. With respect to the bump in product sales, I thought I heard mentioned in the call that some of that maybe related to signing up new clients on the rGuest platform. Is there any associated product sales that goes along with an initial implementation of the rGuest platform? So, from a product perspective basically its two-fold right, so for example when somebody buys rGuest Pay, there is a hardware component so there is some product revenue associated with that. But what we’re also seeing is what you’re seeing is more multi-product sales so you’re seeing people buying a whole evolution where they’re buying InfoGenesis and rGuest Pay, right. So that we’re getting both components as a combined deal on that multiple sale deal. Perfect. And let’s see, so that’s enough from a top line. When it comes to a little bit about cash flow, how do you expect to see, so you mentioned that it should be positive by fiscal year end ‘16, how do you expect to see software expenditures going forward CapEx? Sure. So, from a CapEx perspective we’ve obviously said we’re filling in the investment cycle this year. And I think on previous calls we’ve indicated obviously similar levels to last year which is in that $15 million to $20 million range which is driving our cash. We’re expecting that that’s going to go down more towards normalized rates in fiscal ‘17 so that 5% type of, 5% to 7% type of revenue to be able to kind of bring that back to normalized levels. And then obviously offsetting that would be the EBITDA or cash flow generation we’re expecting from the business with a continued growth in top-line and continued management of our operating expenses down but get the free cash flow positive. Okay, got it, got it. And then a general product question. You guys are continually updating the software which is normal. Do your customers pay for those version update or is that something that they just plug in and click update and they get the newest version? If they are current on their maintenance or they are current as a subscriber, they have entitlement to the next release or the next version update. What would typically happen when that occurs is some level of professional services alongside that order for implementation, training, configuration services and maybe some modest hardware upgrades that are also attendant to that upgrade cycle or that version-upgrade. As we’ve noted on the call, when they have upgraded to the latest release, whether it’s Visual One, InfoGenesis or LMS, the latest releases also contain key components of integration that attach to the rGuest platform. And it’s at that time we have the opportunity to introduce to that customer the rGuest platform advantages whether it’s Pay, See, Analyze or in some cases we try to introduce them to the Stay product in an effort to at least trial it at a property or two where they might be a traditional TMS customer of ours. So that’s what happens in the upgrade cycle. Great, thank you. I have just two follow-up questions. The first is, it appears that services gross margin has still not recovered compared to the prior year’s quarter. Are there still project runs that you guys are working through, how do we think about this? Sure. Stan, the margins in this quarter are actually back to more normalized rates. The projects that we discussed in Q4 are on-track so we’re not seeing any more over run. Q1 of last year was slightly higher than normal run rate due to some custom does projects that were included. So, it is back to where we anticipate it to be. Great, great. And I guess last question is, how should we look or how should we consider product sales for the remainder of the year, are there any guidance you can give in that regard? We don’t guide on components of revenue, we have been trying to guide on the composite revenue picture that Janine provided earlier. I think that the way we’re emphasizing the selling motion in the business is the preferred description to license based sales which will drive higher on a recurring revenue line than it would on a product line. And that’s the way I think to think about a model to business. Thank you. At this time I’d like to turn the call back to Mr. Jim Dennedy for any closing remarks. Thank you, Vince.
