What U.S. Growth Looks Like Without the Government Spending Slowdown - Real Time Economics - WSJ The latest budget proposal, which Congress is considering this week, would boost discretionary federal spending by around $80 billion over the next two years. If the government hadn’t pulled back on spending since 2010, the economy would have grown at near a 3% pace. In that case, economists may have a more rosy assessment of the mostly sluggish expansion. From 2010 through the first half of 2015, year-over-yearÂ economic growth was 0.9 percentage point lower, on average, than it would have otherwise been without the government pullback, according to an analysis of Commerce Department data. That negative for the economy’s near-term growth prospects could be easing significantly thanksÂ  to a budget deal in Congress that would lift federal spending levels and rising home values that should allow local governments to collect more in property taxes. The drag was most pronounced in 2010 and 2013. ItÂ came after federal stimulus spending expired and was replaced by spending cuts. AtÂ the same time, state and local governments were feeling the full effect of lower postrecession revenues. The drag lessened somewhat over the past year to about a 0.5 percentage point. That coincides with a federal budget agreement that bluntedÂ the impact of automatic spending cuts known as the sequester. The level of government spending has begun to rise again, but it’s still growing at slower pace than the rest of the economy. The latest budget proposal, which Congress is considering this week, would boost discretionary federal spending further, by around $80 billion over the next two years. The dataÂ shows purely whatÂ economic output would look like with government outlays excluded, without consideration of uncertainty orÂ potential tax burden mounting government deficits create for businesses and consumers. The debate about the appropriate level of government spending has intensified in recent years. Many Democrats argue that sequester cuts were an â€œunforced errorâ€? that stymied economic growth. But some Republicans say large deficits, along with regulations and tax policies, are themselves the largest barriers to stronger economic output. One Big Factor in the Economic Uptick: Government Spending We welcome thoughtful comments from readers. Please comply with our guidelines . Our blogs do not require the use of your real name. The article based on a false premise.  The idea that GDP is a measure of growth is complete non-sense on its face.  The metric is the sum of Government Spending, Consumption, Investment and the net of Imports and Exports.  Government spending is 40% deficit spending; so any increase in Government Spending represents an increase in the deficit.  To suggest that increase in government debt can be a proxy for growth is non-sense.  The Consumption metric in the GDP is also a nonsense measure of growth.  You can't measure growth by what you borrow and spend....you can only measure it by what you produce.  The GDP is a spending metric....a better measure of growth would be to divide the "investment" measure of GDP by the total GDP....if that goes up you are growing, if that goes down you are getting poorer spending your savings and borrowing against your future production.
