Thank you for joining our conference call and your continued interest in Thermon. Today, we have Jay Peterson our CFO joining me on the conference call. Jay will follow me and present the financial details of our fiscal 2016 fourth quarter and full year. However to start, revenue and earnings were largely as expected for the fourth quarter with the exceptions of gross margins which were below expectations due to mix, price and volume. Jay will cover this in more detail during the financial results. Given the current uncertainty, I would like to begin with a few comments about our end markets and the macro environment we are experiencing. During the last earnings call, we noted that our business continues to be negatively impacted by two primary factors; the low price of oil and the strong U.S. dollar. Fortunately, we've begun to see some stabilization in the price of oil in the mid $40 per barrel range over the last few weeks. In addition, the FX headwinds have begun to moderate although a Fed increase in the interest rate could lead to further strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Turning now to provide some color commentary on our three primary end markets; Oil & Gas, chemical and power. Despite the increase in stable specialization in oil prices, we continue to see customers delay projects and maintenance spending. By far, upstream projects are the most heavily impacted. We do see some downstream projects proceeding driven by emissions requirements, changing feedstock and modernization. While the chemical sector has been robust, we have begun to see the increase in supply from the shale plays beginning to drive margin compression leading to project delays in this sector. Projects that are currently under way are proceeding albeit at a slower pace. Power projects continue to remain strong driven by conversion of coal to cleaner natural gas fired plants as well as increases in emissions monitoring that is favorable to our tubing bundled product lines. Geographically, we see two very different stories. The U.S. and Europe Middle East and Africa both delivered record years in fiscal 2016. Conversely, our Canadian business was down by 54% and $53.3 million in revenue from fiscal 2015 driven by a seizure in both capital and maintenance spending there. Going forward, we will continue to tightly manage costs commensurate with the level of incoming business and selectively invest where we see growth opportunities. Over the last several months our management team and the Board of Directors have been working closely together to build our strategy for the next five years and beyond. The goal has been to expand the addressable market while leveraging our core competencies to provide double-digit shareholder returns in spite of the low oil price environment. Following a disciplined process, we have identified areas for growth that will expand the addressable market by two to three times over the next five years. We are currently building plans to grow the business organically through the introduction of new products, services and geographic expansion. We will also leverage our strong balance sheet and debt capacity to grow inorganically via our M & A pipeline. We continued to focus on new product development to differentiate our offerings in the marketplace by providing more comprehensive solutions to customers. In April, we announced the release of our new TraceNet command software. This new offering provides customers a comprehensive communications and control platform to more cost effectively manage the very large complex facilities. In addition, three significant product introductions are planned throughout the balance of the year. Consistent with our growth strategy we will continue to invest in new product developments and other strategic growth initiatives throughout fiscal 2017 to be well positioned when our end markets recover. We are also pleased to announce that Jim Pribble just joined our organization as Senior Vice President of Corporate Development. In this role, Jim will lead strategy execution to drive both organic and inorganic growth opportunities. Looking forward, our core business model remains resilient, our balance sheet remains strong and our cash conversion allow us to operate from a position of strength. In the near-term, we anticipate the Canadian business to decline an additional $5 million to $8 million during fiscal 2017. This contraction in our organic business will be offset by revenue growth and other geographies and a full year revenue impact, revenue contribution from industrial process insulators, our most recent acquisition. We also anticipate margin pressure to continue due to an unfavorable mix, lower volumes and pricing pressures. Our revenue guidance for fiscal 2017 is flat to low single-digit growth over the prior year. To support this projection the higher quota activity noted in Q3 has translated into 5% backlog growth year-over-year and a favorable book-to-bill in Q4. Thermon's updated pipeline of future projects remained healthy with over 800 identified opportunities for heat tracing with an estimated total value of over $1.1 billion over the next three to five years. We continue to believe in near-term challenges are cyclical and not structural in nature. The reduced maintenance spending currently seen across the industry cannot continue indefinitely and is likely creating pent-up demand for a recovery cycle in the future. An increase in this area will improve the mix and has historically positively impacted gross margins. Our management team would like to thank our employees throughout our global organization for their hard work and dedication. We would also like to thank our customers, shareowners and advisors for their support and confidence. Thank you again for joining us today. I'd like to start off by discussing our Q4 results and then turn to our fiscal year results and then conclude with some high-level guidance for fiscal year 2017. First off, revenue this past quarter totaled $72.3 million and that's a decrease of 3% over the prior year's quarter. Relative to the prior year quarter, our organic revenue declined by $7.1 million or 9.5%. FX currency fluctuations impacted revenue by a negative $2.3 million or negative 3% and M&A revenue contributed $7 million for the quarter or positive growth of 9.3%. In the quarter, we continued to experience erosion with our Canadian business which was down 34% year-on-year on a constant currency basis. Our MRO/UE mix for Q4 was 60% of revenues this quarter whereas greenfield totaled 40%. Orders for the quarter totaled $73 million versus $52 million in the prior quarter for a growth of 39% and we saw double-digit order growth in the United States, Asia Pacific and Europe. Our backlog of orders ended March at $81 million versus $76 million at the end of Q4 fiscal year 2016 and that's an increase of 7%. And foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted our backlog by $1.2 million. In terms of gross margins, margin dollars this past quarter totaled $32 million or 44.4% of revenue versus the prior year quarter, our margins decreased by 150 basis points due to several factors including a decline in MRO/UE margins due to lower sales to our agents, product mix, volume contraction and an increase of lower margin construction business. Operating expense that is core operating expense for the quarter and this excludes depreciation, amortization and transaction related expenses totaled $18.7 million and that's an increase of 4% from prior year. This increase in spending was related to managing our growing backlog and the double-digit order growth we experienced in the quarter. Our operating expense as a percent of revenue was a competitive 26%, again excluding depreciation and amortization. The number of full time employees at the end of March was 1021 and that's up from 894 as of calendar March 2015. 130 of these additions were related to our recent acquisitions with our year-on-year headcount essentially flat in our organic business. Turning to earnings. GAAP EPS for the quarter totaled $0.10 compared to a prior year $0.33. After adjusting for a $1.8 million Escrow settlement to the predecessor owners of our Sumac business and a $1.7 million impairment of certain assets related to our Unitemp acquisition, our adjusted EPS this quarter was $0.20 versus $0.28 in the prior year. FX fluctuations negatively impacted our EPS by a penny and our free cash flow EPS significantly outstripped GAAP EPS for the quarter and totaled $0.32 a share. Our adjusted EBITDA totaled $14.4 million in the quarter and adjusted EBITDA as a percent of revenue was 20% this past quarter. From a balance sheet perspective, our cash grew to $84.6 million this past quarter and on a net debt to EBITDA basis, this ratio ended the quarter at 0.2 and we anticipate to be debt free on a net debt basis this fiscal year. Turning to the full year 2016 performance. As a recap, we accomplished the following this last year. Three of our four major geographies grew top-line this past year. On a constant currency basis, we completed three acquisitions, two of which generated positive return on invested capital. We are able to hold gross margins at 46.6% for the year in a very difficult competitive and macro environment. We generated free cash flow EPS of $1.16 a share versus adjusted EPS of $0.89 a share. And lastly, we reduced our debt balance to $94 million, a reduction of $13 million over the last 12 months. Now, turning to fiscal 2017 guidance. Several points I would like to offer. First off, we are planning top-line revenue to be in the flat to low single-digit growth for the fiscal year. Gross margins are estimated to be in the mid 40% range and that's consistent with our past guidance. As Bruce mentioned, fiscal year 2017 is going to be an investment year for Thermon and we expect operating expense growth to outpace revenue growth; however, if we see our order rates decline, our flexible cost structure will enable us to tighten spending as necessary. And lastly, our planned CapEx for this year will total $8.5 million or 3% of revenue and that's down from $10.4 million in CapEx in fiscal year 2016. Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your question please. So just on the guidance of flat to low single-digit growth you gave some good color on Canada. Maybe just give us some color on how you're thinking about the other regions within growth. Yes. Jeff, this is Bruce. Real quickly looking at the various regions, we do see it's fairly broad based both in the U.S. we see the strongest market. We see growth opportunities in Latin America as well after a pretty soft year, and then, some probably fairly flat in Europe, Middle East Africa and some growth opportunities in Asia Pacific. Okay. And then, you mentioned in your remarks some pricing pressure. Can you speak to where you're seeing that and I think you said it's likely to persist do you see it kind of stabilizing at this lower level or do you see more risk for pricing pressure going forward maybe just a comment there. The pricing pressure we've historically felt in greenfield because there's less work being released it's even more competitive, so we see it there. We also see pricing pressure in our MRO business. We certainly, we would expect based on the current environment we don't see it improving so we would expect margins in this level to continue through the balance of fiscal 2017. So when you say kind of margins continuing in the range that you saw closer in the fourth quarter versus the full year? Yes. I would say thereabouts, but I don't think we will continue to repeat what we had in the fourth quarter, so I would look more to what we had for the balance of the year. But, we could have a specific quarter if we had a large greenfield project Bill in that quarter that was very competitively bid. We could see margins as we experienced in Q4. We would like to kind of go back to that 45% range that we've historically generated. We certainly in 2015 we had margins significantly higher but we believe the 45% range is what we would expect in this current environment. Okay. And then just lastly, within that kind of low or flat to low single digits, are you thinking about MRO and greenfield much differently? No. We don't see big swings in that. We think the 60/40 mix is what we would expect going forward. Yes. The orders were fairly broad based. We have had a number of sizeable chemical -- petrochemical projects that have contributed that but it's generally broad based ex-Canada. 29%. We had a couple of adjustments this last quarter. The significant adjustment was related to a European affiliate that had a one-time structural change for fiscal year 2017, excuse me fiscal year 2016, but we don't expect that to continue for 2017. We're modeling 29%. In the quarter? The revenue for Canada came in at $11.5 million, Europe $17.4 million, the U.S. $28.1 million, Asia-Pac $8.1 million, Latin America $300,000, and then the three acquisitions they totaled $7 million for the quarter. So Jay, a question for you. Over the last two quarters we have been -- you guys have been talking about some improvement in kind of mix shift towards chemical and power projects. And when I look at the orders in the backlog, could you give us some color and with respect to your guidance for the next year, is that something which will become a little bit more dominant in terms of top-line growth as we continue to see oil and gas capital spending still kind of weak for your customers not going to spend like next year. And so just give us some color about chemical and the power markets here. Yes. We continue to see a favorable trend in our U.S. business, which has a significant component in power and chemical. And we also believe that even though in this last quarter we had a dip in agent sales that often ultimately end up in chemical and power and we see that to have a resurgence this coming year. So it's possible we will have yet another record year in the U.S. going forward. Okay. And when I look at, the next question for Bruce here on M&A, if I remember correctly, Bruce we spoke before about like your venture in -- you'd mentioned about like going into steam tracing that could be one of the growth avenues going forward. And with IPI under your belt, that could be some leverage that you could pull off like on the steam tracing side. Can you give us some color like which growth areas -- when you mentioned geographically, you want to do some expansion, with respect to that if you can talk about like the steam tracing market and the growth avenue over there? Well, Thermon begin in steam tracing, so it's nothing new to the business. We have been winning some nice opportunities in steam tracing. IPI, that acquisition has given us the capabilities to execute on the field service and construction aspect of those projects as well which has helped us win. We will continue to look at that space as an opportunity to really continue to grow our business in industrial process heating. Geographically, we do see ex-kind of U.S. and Canada; we see opportunities particularly in Eurasia and in Asia to geographically grow our business. So those are some of the areas we see opportunities for growth. Okay. And lastly, Jay, if you can give us the growth rates for the geographical, I think you gave the dollar numbers here for U.S., Canada. Do you have the growth numbers like Canada declined by ex percentage? Yes. Canada was down 41%, Europe was down 25%, the U.S. in the quarter, which was an anomaly because they had growth for the year was down 5.4%, Asia-Pac for the quarter was down 19% and that excludes the acquisition related revenue. I'm sorry; I said Europe was down, it was up 25%, I apologize. Good morning. I wanted to start by asking about Canada. Obviously, it was major events up there with the fires. And first and foremost, I was happy to hear that it sounds like everyone on the team is safe although sorry to hear some people lost some property. But, I'm wondering as you look at your first fiscal first quarter with Canada obviously down a lot, but still about close to 20% of revenue. How is that affecting -- how were those fires affecting their activity for you and also maybe just comment like what you're seeing with respect to the industry in general up there right now. Well, Brian, this is Bruce. We have been out of our facilities for a couple of weeks now and certainly in a number of those operations have been idle. Just recently they've announced the start-up of a couple of the major operations, so we would expect that to begin to resume. But certainly, our quick turn sales have been softer given the idling of a lot of these facilities. So near term, we would expect where we are seeing slowdown there that will impact us in the first quarter, we don't believe that that will have a significant impact over the course of the year as these facilities start up and get to running. Is it a big enough issue to where we should be modeling a down tick in revenue or blip in the first quarter that then recovers as we move through the year? What we see typically our first quarter is the softest quarter of our year. And so I would reiterate that. And then, I would also say that looking at timing of backlog we do see that schedule out across the year. Okay. So the seasonality in the first quarter is understood. I'm just wondering is it just to be clear, is the seasonality or is that weakness in the first quarter going to be more severe than typical given the fire? Okay. All right. And then, Bruce maybe you could talk a little bit about the plan to expand the addressable market over the next five years. Can you tell us if you have any clue as to what measures you're taking, any specific measures you're taking to expand the 2 to 3x? Yes. We are looking at adjacencies in and around what we provide to the industry and our focus is on industrial process heating with heat tracing being that core offering. But building around that. And then also, we see opportunities to really go beyond that and leverage our core competencies into some other areas of industrial process heating where we can really deliver an engineered solution in hazardous environments that create value for our customers. Our focus really is on our end markets which our oil and gas, the chemical and power, some of the opportunities could give us depending on the end markets could give us more diversification outside of oil and gas. Okay. And then, maybe just two more quick ones. Break down of your revenue currently are in this most recent quarter in terms of oil and gas, petrochem, power gen? We don't have that. We only do that on an annual basis and we're in the process of doing those calculations. We'll have those available -- Okay. Thanks. And then, I just want to be clear, so with the revenue guidance and what you said about margins and OpEx outpacing revenue growth, is it fair to for us to model EBITDA down in fiscal 2017 then? I would say that it's going to be more like not to get too specific, but we ended 65 for the year, 65.3 and it would be in that neighborhood with a modest reduction. Hi, guys. This is actually Patrick Scholes standing in for Charlie thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to talk about, I think you guys mentioned obviously pricing is a big thing for you guys in both MRO and greenfield. And I think mix more on the MRO side, so just want to touch upon that a little bit and in terms of the project that you guys are seeing in your backlog and obviously with the competitive pricing. And usually these projects are longer term in nature, how long do you think the drag will be to your margins as you work down this backlog? And then on the MRO side, is service, what is the mix of service with an MRO/UE for this quarter because we would imagine that's generally on the lower end of the margins so that's why the mix hasn't dragged down, is that correct to say that? Yes. In terms of your first question, the backlog margins, that's a very difficult question for us to answer in that the MRO has significant velocity to it. It comes and goes very quickly. And whether we bill or not bill a certain greenfield project in a given quarter, it will impact our margins. But, the guidance is this 60/40 split going forward and we don't have any evidence that that will change due to the current dynamics that we see in the backlog. And I guess how about the second part which is the service portion of the MRO/UE, was that -- what was the mix on that? That's something that we have not in the past disclosed, but we believe that will trend upward this year due to several initiatives and investments we are making in our services business. Okay. That's fair. And I think last quarter you guys mentioned that fiscal year 2016, you guys expected acquisitions to comprise around $30 million and I think it came in around $26 million. And I guess over the past few months what have you seen that shift in terms of the dynamics for that, I guess shortfall in the $4 million, can you guys maybe provide a little more color on? Yes. The main driver of that and it's actually very good news when you look out over the next several years and that is our temporary power business that we acquired has started a rental program just about the time we acquired them. And we made a certain assumption in terms of revenue mix for purchases versus rentals and they significantly outstripped the rental mix that we anticipated. And even though we saw them not hitting their revenue target, they did hit actually slightly exceeded their earnings target, their EBITDA target due to this margin rich, profit rich revenue business that will -- rental business that will continue into fiscal year 2017. So that's the biggest reason we did not hit that $30 million number. Okay. And if I can add one more, orders obviously was very strong this quarter and I think last quarter you guys mentioned quoting activity was up but that was not necessarily translated to bookings. Wanted to see if you guys can quantify how much of the increase in orders this quarter was maybe like a push back into this current quarter and how much of that is sort of a slightly improved view on the macro environment at least with oil prices inching up closer to $50. How would you classify the dynamics between those two? Yes. They are both favorable trends, especially the oil number and the quotes obviously and there is a lag or a delay between the time we quote business to the time that we win the order. But both were favorable. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is a follow-up from the line of Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your question please. Hi, guys. I don't know if I missed this, but within like the flat to low single-digit growth, what's kind of acquisition contribution versus FX headwind? Jeff, what we see is the acquisitions will contribute an additional $6 million to $8 million in revenue during the fiscal year and then the balance would be what we see in our organic business. And I think for the current quarter it's going to be a magnitude of maybe and I'm guessing here a $0.5 million negative. Okay. And then, on new product spend, do we see incremental growth in spending or is it just continued to stay at the high level you had in 2016? We do see some incremental growth in spending in the range of about $3 million that we're investing in not only new product development but some other growth -- organic growth initiatives. So we do see that some growth in those areas. And Jeff, we've got plans for growing organically our new products introductions so that by fiscal 2021, we would expect an incremental $40 million annually from these new product offerings. Okay. And then, you mentioned the one new product and then you had three more rolling out. Is there anything you can talk about on the three new? Hi, just on new products again. Could you give us a sense which end markets these new products are going out in terms of? They're fairly broad based. So these are platforms that really can be utilized in any of our end markets in applications for industrial process heating. Okay. And just wanted to get a sense of when I look at the pie chart from the end market perspective now, I believe about like 25% of your channel kind of distribution base, what are you hearing through your distribution chain, what kind of growth we had in the quarter and if you want to talk about that for fiscal 2017, how do we see that? Well, yes, so we actually saw that fairly weak in the fourth quarter and that was part of the margin decline in MRO sales that Jay had noted in the financial reporting. So we have continued to see some softness there. But as I spoke about -- we see that the maintenance spending in some of the smaller projects, the UE piece of our MRO those small upgrades and expansions we would expect that a lot of that spending is being deferred, much of it is related to critical maintenance or some of it even driven by regulatory requirements. So we do anticipate a return predicting that timing is difficult. And as I said as we begin to see that spending increase that has historically been favorable to our margin mix. Okay. And lastly on one of the geographies like Asia Pacific especially the Middle East or what you saw on the quarter end and how should we think that going into fiscal 2017. Any changes from last year or like worse or better? Middle East is actually one of our bright spots in Europe. There's a couple of areas that are positive, the Eurasia has actually been strong as well and we have a very strong backlog in the Middle East although the mix of business, the margins are not as favorable but we have a very strong backlog going into the fiscal year. Thank you. And this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Bruce Thames for any further remarks. Again, I'd like to thank everyone for your interest in Thermon. Thank you for joining us today and we appreciate your support. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.
