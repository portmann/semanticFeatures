Ensync Earnings Call Reports Progress On Multiple Fronts - EnSync, Inc. (NYSEMKT:ESNC) | Seeking Alpha PPA business experiencing continued growth in Hawaii, with backlog up to $11.2 million, and total company backlog at $14 million. Regulatory change in Hawaii increases demand for energy storage. Partnership with SPI taking shape, significant revenue this fiscal year. Based on backlog and management comments on SPI, fiscal 2016 revenue should reach $15 to $20 million. ESNC trades well below its cash/asset value of roughly $0.80 per share and the company on the cusp of a significant revenue/earnings ramp. Earlier this month I wrote about the transformation of Ensync, Inc (NYSEMKT: ESNC ), detailing the huge potential for this micro-cap company that is currently trading under its cash value. On Monday, the company reported fiscal Q1 earnings and held a conference call, making this a good time to provide an update on the company. As expected, revenue was minimal, but there were several developments discussed on the conference call that are very encouraging, and continue to give us conviction that ESNC is nearing an inflection point. The company reported a total backlog of $14 million ($11.2 million from the PPA business), and expects most, if not all of that to be recognized as revenue this fiscal year. They also discussed utility regulatory changes in Hawaii that significantly increase the need for storage to be paired with any solar installation. Lastly, the company updated investors on the relationship with Solar Power Inc ( OTCQB:SOPW ), which continues to gain momentum, and expects to generate meaningful revenue this fiscal year. The most significant developments in the quarter occurred in the company's Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) business, where the company installs solar and storage at their own expense, and sells energy to the customer over a 20 year period. This is a new business for ESNC, selling their first PPA earlier in 2015. On the call, the company reported that they now have 8 PPA's signed, resulting in a backlog worth over $11 million. The accounting treatment for these agreements requires ESNC to defer revenue until the project is monetized, either through energy sales or a sale of the entire agreement. ESNC has indicated that they plan to sell the PPA's upon completion, and expect that most or all of these 8 agreements will be sold with a margin, before the end of their fiscal year next June. The bigger development for ESNC is the regulatory change regarding Hawaiian Electric Co, Hawaii's largest electric provider. Because electricity in Hawaii costs about four times the national average, at $0.40 per kWh, solar installation has been booming over the past several years. The economics for the consumer are very good, as they can generate free electricity when the sun is shining, and sell any unused electricity to the grid for $0.40 per kWh, a process called net metering. So many of these installations have taken place, that the grid can't handle any more solar power being put into the grid. As a result, last month the utility put an end to net metering . While existing customers are unaffected, any new solar installations won't be allowed to sell power back to the grid. This makes nearly all solar installation on the island uneconomical. This doesn't mean that Hawaii won't be installing solar going forward, it just means that any solar installation is likely to include a storage component. If you can't sell the power back to the grid, the only way to make the project economically viable is to store it onsite for use at a later time, allowing you to avoid paying the high electric costs when the sun isn't shining. This is a very significant development for ESNC, as all solar providers will be looking for an energy storage supplier to pair with all of their installations. The company indicated that in the few weeks since this announcement, they have seen an uptick in demand. On the call, the company reiterated that they believe this opportunity exceeds $50 million over the next two years. I believe that this regulatory development, in addition to growing a backlog from zero to $11 million in a few short months, makes that estimate conservative, and the potential could be much larger. In July, ESNC finalized a strategic partnership with SOPW, where SOPW would purchase 40 kW of storage, worth roughly $100 million in revenue, in exchange for warrants to purchase ESNC stock (for more detail, see my previous ESNC article). The first milestone in that agreement is to deliver 5 kW of storage, which was expected to take about a year. On the call, the company said that the relationship is gaining momentum, and reiterated that any results would be back-end loaded in this fiscal year, but they continue to be on track to deliver the 5 kW during the summer of 2016. Management said that if the entire amount didn't fall in this fiscal year, it would be shortly after. The 5 kW of storage is worth roughly $12.5 million in revenue to the company. Until recently, ESNC has been a stock that is difficult to value. While they have game-changing technology related to a multi-billion dollar market, their sales have been viewed as something in the distant future. With the comments made by management today, it's becoming clear that the revenues aren't in the distant future, they are in the current fiscal year. The company plans to sell the PPA's this fiscal year, with a margin. The contracts are valued at $11.2 million, meaning they could recognize several million more than that. On the partnership with SOPW, even if they only complete half of the work they expect to complete, it would mean $6 million in revenue. Those two items combine for revenue of $15 to $20 million. For the following fiscal year, ESNC expects to provide 10 kW of storage in the SOPW deal ($25 million of revenue), and another $25 million in PPA (based on the two year, $50 million forecast), meaning revenue could double or triple next year. Despite near-term revenue, and exponential growth next year, the company still trades like revenues are many years away. As of September 30, the company had $0.79 per share in cash, and trades at just $0.50. The sell-side analyst that covers the stock continues to have a $1.50 price target, which seems very reasonable given what we know today, and provides three times your investment from the current stock price. We are very encouraged by the progress made during the quarter, and continue to have conviction that this technology will revolutionize the industry.
