Abe's New Fiscal Stimulus Plan Makes Japan Attractive - WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:DXJ) | Seeking Alpha Negative bond rates show how desperately global economy needs fiscal stimulus. Lack of global economic strength makes growth regions even more attractive. Abe's fiscal stimulus plan targets the right type of government spending to stimulate the economy. Ever since the official end of the Great Recession the world has been in dire need of fiscal stimulus. Europe is mired in self-defeating continued austerity. The UK has flirted with austerity budget twice under Cameron (the new Prime Minister could bring a change). In the US there is no political appetite for large scale fiscal stimulus, in fact we are just recovering from our own bout of mini-austerity with the lifting of the budget sequestration agreement for the next two years. The amount of government bonds with a negative yield is staggering. Enter Japan. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's ruling Liberal Democratic Party just won a landslide victory in the upper house elections. Abe has promised to unveil a new fiscal stimulus plan. While the complete plan has not been released some details have been leaked. The fiscal stimulus plan is thought to be around 10T yen or about $100B US dollars and will primarily be focused on infrastructure spending. The fiscal stimulus will be equal to about 2.4% of Japanese GDP. In comparison the $800B fiscal stimulus in the US following the recession was worth about 5.5% of GDP at the time. While the Japanese plan is not of the same scale it's still big enough to take note off. It's also important to note that infrastructure spending has a very high multiple. In fact according to a recent study it has one of the highest fiscal multipliers of any type of government spending. One dollar of infrastructure spending was worth about two dollars to economic growth. By comparison direct assistance to lower income groups had a fiscal multiplier of around 1.7 to 1.8 and tax cuts ranged from slightly greater than one for payroll tax cuts down to .29 for making the Bush era tax cuts permanent. Yes, Japan is not the US so things may be slightly different but the point is it is a very effective form of spending when it comes to growing GDP. So, just how much effect will the stimulus plan have on the stock market? Well no one knows for sure but take a look at the US for example. Out of all the major developed countries the US has engaged in the least amount of post recession austerity and has experienced the strongest economic recovery (compared to peers, not in an absolute sense) and consequently has had the strongest stock market performance. I think it makes sense that in a world with very little growth investors will flock to the markets of countries that are stable and doing well. The biggest issue investors face when looking to add Japanese companies to their portfolio is foreign exchange rates. For foreign investors the issue can present a catch-22. The Japanese economy is export oriented (they run a trade surplus) and thus a weak yen helps the economy as it makes Japanese goods cheaper for foreign buyers. A weak yen means more sales and profits for Honda and a rising stock price. But for foreign investor the weak yen which is driving up sales and profits for Honda also lowers the value of their stock holding in the company. Predicting the movements of foreign currency can be a tricky thing. Will the yen weaken because of the new spending measures by Abe and the increase of yen in circulation? Or will the yen strengthen because the Japanese economy starts to improve? Luckily investors have a variety of choices. The table below shows three popular Japanese ETFs. We have the iShares MSCI Japan ETF (NYSEARCA: EWJ ) which covers large and midsized Japanese equities, the iShares MSCI Japan Small-Cap ETF (NYSEARCA: SCJ ) that covers small cap Japanese equities, and the WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity Fund (NYSEARCA: DXJ ). All funds carry the same expense ratio so picking the best one comes down to your thoughts on the yen. We think the currency hedged version is likely the best since our investment thesis centers around Abe's new fiscal stimulus plan improving the Japanese economy. This alleviates the need for investors to monitor two things, the Japanese economy and the currency markets, instead of just one. It's also worth noting that the small cap Japanese ETF will likely have less export focused companies then the large cap ETF. On the surface the two ETF's look very similar when you break them down by sector. The small cap ETF has a slightly higher weighting towards industrials and financials. The consumer sector (staples and discretionary together) are equal with the sector being weighted at 29% for the large and mid cap ETF and 29.5% for the small cap ETF. It's worth noting that all of the large export oriented car manufacturers like Toyota, Honda, and Nissan are all considered consumer discretionary stocks and the largest consumer staples stock is Seven and I Holding which is the owner of the 7-11 retail brand (found worldwide). Missing almost entirely from the small cap ETF is the telecommunications sector, not unsurprising given that sector is dominated by the large incumbent firms such as NTT DoCoMo. All in all there is not much difference between the two ETFs except the fact that the small cap ETF will have more exposure to the domestic Japanese market.
