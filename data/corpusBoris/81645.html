UTG Vs UTF: Is One CEF Better Than The Other? - Reaves Utility Income Fund (NYSEMKT:UTG) | Seeking Alpha Cohen & Steers Infrastructure Fund is, too. A comment on an article I wrote about the Reaves Utility Income Fund (NYSEMKT: UTG ) asked how the Cohen & Steers Infrastructure Fund (NYSE: UTF ) stacked up against it. The answer, as usual, isn't a clear winner/loser thing. Both Reaves and Cohen & Steers Infrastructure invest in the hard assets that make the world work. The things you and I take for granted, like power plants, railroads, toll roads, telephones, and pipelines. Although they have different weighting across these, and more, subsectors of the infrastructure space, the investment focus of this pair of funds is basically very similar. Some other broad similarities between the funds include the use of leverage, with UTF's leverage coming in at nearly 30% of assets at the end of March and Reeve's leverage at a touch over 25% last October (it's last annual report date). So, not much difference here. Expenses, meanwhile, are in the same ballpark, though Cohen & Steers' around 2.2% expense ratio is higher than UTG's around 1.7%. Risk wise, there's an interesting trend. UTG is slightly more volatile, based on standard deviation, over the trailing three year period through May, UTG and UTF have roughly similar standard deviations over the trailing five year period, and UTG is less volatile over the trailing decade. Performance, meanwhile, does exactly the opposite of what you might expect from that information: over the trailing three years lower-volatility Cohen & Steers Infrastructure beats UTG, performance is comparable over the trailing five years, and UTG bests Cohen & Steers Infrastructure over the trailing decade. (These performance comparisons are based on net asset value returns inclusive of reinvested distributions.) At the end of the day, however, neither is a bad performer over the long haul. For example, over the trailing decade Cohen & Steers Infrastructure had an annualized total return of nearly 9%. UTG, meanwhile, had an annualized total return of almost 11%. Clearly UTG was the better fund over that span, but you'd be hard pressed to complain about UTF's return. So, at some level, either of these funds would provide you with a decent one-stop option for infrastructure assets. However, there are some differences worth noting. A big one for income investors is that Reaves pays its distribution monthly while Cohen & Steers Infrastructure pays quarterly. That's not a huge difference, but could be material if you are trying to replace a monthly pay check with income from your portfolio. That, however, has to be juxtaposed against yield. UTF's distribution yield is around 7.3%. Compare that to Reaves' distribution yield, which is roughly 6.2%. This, however, isn't the end of the story. For example, Reaves is proud to note that its distribution has never included return of capital. Cohen & Steers Infrastructure had to support its distribution with return of capital in 2011 and 2012. The net asset value went down in only one of those years, so destructive return of capital wasn't a lingering issue. But for some investors return of capital is a big concern. Both funds have increased their distributions a couple of times since 2010, though clearly Reaves had more leeway to do so than UTF. Another notable difference is the discount at which each of these funds is trading relative to their net asset values. Reave's is trading at a roughly 2.5% discount and Cohen & Steers Infrastructure is trading at an around 14% discount (which is one of the reasons why the yield is higher, too). UTG's 2.5% discount is actually less than its long-term historical average of about 5.5% over the trailing decade. UTF's 14% discount is wider than its roughly 12% average discount over that span. So if you are looking to buy on the cheap, Cohen & Steers Infrastructure is clearly the better option right now. At the end of the day, neither of these two funds is a bad choice. If you like getting a bargain and are focused on yield, Cohen & Steers Infrastructure appears to have the edge. That said, it is a more expensive fund to own, so if you prefer to keep costs low you shouldn't be in UTF. For investors seeking monthly distributions from a fund that doesn't dip into capital, Reaves is the better option, with lower costs an added benefit. For my two cents, I'd go with Reaves, but I would be hard pressed to suggest Cohen & Steers Infrastructure is a bad fund. Source: UTG Vs UTF: Is One CEF Better Than The Other?
