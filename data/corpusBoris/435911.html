Fifth Street Finance's Dividend Projection For September-November 2016 (Including Why This Stock Is Currently Undervalued) - Fifth Street Finance (NASDAQ:FSC) | Seeking Alpha To fully understand and accurately project a BDCâ€™s dividend sustainability, readers must understand the subtle differences between a companyâ€™s NII and net ICTI. To understand this distinction, this article analyzes FSCâ€™s near-term dividend sustainability by performing two tests based on recent quarterly results. These two tests analyze FSCâ€™s net ICTI and cumulative UTI which are based on IRC methodologies. Results are then compared to the companyâ€™s NII which is based on GAAP methodologies. Summarized results from the tests performed within this analysis, in regards to FSCâ€™s near-term dividend sustainability, are stated within the â€œConclusions Drawnâ€? section of the article. I also provide evidence as to why I currently believe FSC is an attractive equity investment to own from a valuation standpoint. My current price target is $6.25 per share. The focus of this article is to provide a detailed analysis with supporting documentation (via two tests) on the near-term dividend sustainability of Fifth Street Finance Corp. (NASDAQ: FSC ). This analysis will be provided after a brief overview of FSC's regulated investment company ("RIC") classification per the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC"). I will be performing two dividend sustainability tests within this article. These tests will focus on FSC's net investment company taxable income ("ICTI") and cumulative undistributed taxable income ("UTI"). These two tests will be termed "TEST 1" and "TEST 2." Results from these tests will then be compared to FSC's NII during the same timeframes. Showing this comparison will highlight the importance of analyzing IRC methodologies when it comes to assessing FSC's dividend sustainability. Understanding the tax and dividend payout characteristics of FSC will provide investors with an overall better understanding of the business development company ("BDC") sector as a whole. From reading this article, investors will better understand how a RIC per the IRC comes up with the company's current dividend per share rate and specific signs when an impending increase or decrease should occur. Near the end of this article, there will be a conclusion based on the results obtained from TEST 1 and TEST 2 about the near-term dividend sustainability of FSC. I will also provide my projection regarding FSC's monthly dividend per share rate for September - November 2016. With that being said, a company's dividend sustainability is only one factor to consider when choosing a possible equity investment. As such, this article also provides a discussion of the positive and negative factors/catalysts to consider when determining if FSC is currently undervalued or overvalued. At the end of this article, I will provide my current FSC price target and BUY, SELL or HOLD recommendation. In prior BDC articles, I have discussed an entity's RIC classification per the IRC in detail. This included specific provisions that each BDC must adhere by to remain in RIC compliance. There is one specific provision which pertains to FSC's dividend sustainability that should be mentioned. As a RIC, FSC is required to distribute to shareholders at least 90% of the company's "ICTI" and "net capital gains" (in excess of its "capital loss carryforward" balance, if applicable) in any given tax year in order to be eligible for the tax benefits allowed in regards to this type of entity (dividends paid deduction at the corporate level). When these two figures are combined, this comprises FSC's net ICTI which is also known as the company's annual distribution requirement ("ADR"). There is one specific "exclusion" to this rule which is mentioned later in the article (the "spillback provision"). Readers can take a look back at the following Main Street Capital Corp. (NYSE: MAIN ) article for a further discussion of this topic: Management continues to either state or imply (dependent upon which presentation/conversation one reviews) FSC's dividend is mainly based on the following factor: - Intend to cover the company's annual dividend payout level with net ICTI This factor will focus on FSC's net ICTI and cumulative UTI and be analyzed via TEST 1 and TEST 2, respectively. When assessing the results from TEST 1, a comparison between FSC's net ICTI and NII will also occur. To "fully" understand and accurately project a BDC's dividend sustainability, one must understand the subtle differences between a company's NII and net ICTI figures/cumulative balances. NII is a GAAP figure which is based on the accrual method of accounting. ICTI and net ICTI are IRC figures which are "generally" based on the cash method of accounting (some exceptions to this notion but I am keeping it simple for this discussion). In order for FSC to come up with a proper ICTI figure, there are specific GAAP to IRC adjustments (reversals) that need to be performed each quarter. Income and expense recognition of certain accounting transactions differ between GAAP and the IRC (book versus tax accounting treatments). A majority of FSC's book to tax differences (either temporary or permanent in nature) consist of the following: 1) deferred financing fees on loans and deferred offering costs in relation to equity offerings; 2) amortization (accretion) of loan/investment premiums (discounts); and 3) timing recognition of interest income on certain loans/investments (including certain exit fees). In addition, there is several other miscellaneous book to tax adjustments that FSC periodically recognizes. Once FSC's ICTI is known, one adds all net capital gains to this figure (if a capital loss carryforward balance does not exist). Net capital gains consist of realized short-term net capital gains in excess of realized long-term net capital losses for each tax year. Since FSC had a material capital loss carryforward as of 9/30/2015 (thus offsetting any net capital gains that might arise), this balance will continue to remain $0 over the foreseeable future. This would even occur if FSC were to realize a material net capital gain on the company's debt/equity investments during the remaining tax year 2016. After this calculation, FSC's net ICTI figure is known. To test management's main factor, I believe it is necessary to analyze and discuss FSC's prior quarterly net ICTI figures to see if the company's quarterly dividend distributions were covered. This will lead to a better understanding of the overall trends regarding this particular factor and possible future pitfalls that may arise. This includes FSC using the company's cumulative UTI balance on any quarterly net ICTI overpayments. Table 1 below shows FSC's net ICTI for the fiscal second quarter of 2016, fiscal first quarter of 2016, and for the fiscal year 2015. Table 1 then compares FSC's quarterly net ICTI figure to the company's dividend distributions figure showing the quarterly underpayment (overpayment). Table 1 below then shows FSC's cumulative UTI balance for the same timeframe. Side Note: Due to the fact management recognized prior period adjustments (which had a cumulative impact) during FSC's fiscal fourth quarter of 2015, I believe providing readers the company's net ICTI for fiscal year 2015 (as opposed to each quarter) better represents the company's IRC metrics for that specified period of time. In other words, all prior period adjustments in regards to FSC's net ICTI were accounted for during the company's fiscal fourth quarter of 2015 (a cumulative "true down" adjustment occurred). When analyzing these cumulative prior period adjustments on a quarterly basis (as opposed to an annual basis), results become "skewed" per se. Simply put, it's not indicative of what actually occurred during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015. In my professional opinion, this would lead to a "misrepresentation" of quarterly results. Less of a misrepresentation occurs when looking at FSC's net ICTI for 2015 on an annual basis. A detailed discussion of all of FSC's prior period adjustments, including a discussion of why these adjusts were recorded, was provided in the following article: Fifth Street Finance Corp.'s Prior Period Adjustments And The Impact On Dividends (Source: Table created entirely by myself, partially using FSC data obtained from the SEC's EDGAR Database ) Table 1 will be the main source of information as TEST 1 and TEST 2 are analyzed below. Now let us begin FSC's near-term dividend sustainability analysis. TEST 1 - Quarterly Net ICTI Versus Quarterly Distributions Analysis: - See Red References "E, F, G, (F / E)" in Table 1 Above Next to the March 31, 2016, Column Using Table 1 above as a reference, I take FSC's quarterly "net ICTI" figure (see red reference "E") and subtract this amount by the quarterly "distributions to stockholders from net ICTI" figure (see red reference "F"). If FSC's red reference "E" is greater than the company's red reference "F," then FSC technically had enough quarterly net ICTI to pay out the company's dividend distributions for a particular quarter. Any excess net ICTI left over, after accounting for the dividend distributions, would be added to FSC's cumulative UTI balance. This particular balance will be further discussed within TEST 2 later in the article. If FSC's red reference "E" is less than the company's red reference "F," then the company technically did not have enough quarterly net ICTI to pay out its dividend distributions for a particular quarter and must use a portion of the remaining cumulative UTI balance to help with the overpayment. Still using Table 1 above as a reference, FSC had net ICTI of $121.1 million for fiscal year 2015. This figure includes cumulative prior year adjustments totaling ($10.3) million. In comparison, FSC had dividend distributions of ($120.6) million for fiscal year 2015. When calculated, FSC had an underpayment of net ICTI of $0.5 million for fiscal year 2015 (see red reference "G"). This calculates to a dividend distributions payout ratio of 100% for fiscal year 2015 (see red reference "(F / E)"). As such, when including FSC's cumulative prior period adjustments, the company basically matched its dividend distributions to net ICTI for fiscal year 2015. In comparison, FSC had a dividend distributions payout ratio of 116%, 119%, 126% and 106% for fiscal years 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. As such, I believe FSC's dividend distributions payout ratio for fiscal year 2015 was a step in the right direction and should be seen as a positive trend. In addition, as noted above, FSC had cumulative true-down net ICTI adjustments totaling ($10.3) million during fiscal year 2015 in relation to misclassifications over the past several years (2012 - 2015). When excluding FSC's cumulative prior period net ICTI adjustments (a majority of these adjustments were in relation to activity prior to 2015), the company had a dividend distributions payout ratio of 92% for fiscal year 2015. When compared to the annual dividend distribution payout ratios above, this was the first annual net underpayment of net ICTI in five fiscal years. This reduced payout ratio was directly attributable to the new monthly dividend rate of $0.06 per share (new quarterly dividend rate totaling $0.18 per share) which began in March 2015. Now let us take a look at what occurred during FSC's fiscal first and second quarters of 2016. FSC had net ICTI of $35.4 and $35.6 million for the fiscal first and second quarters of 2016, respectively. In comparison, the company had dividend distributions of ($27.1) and ($27.0) million for the fiscal first and second quarters of 2016, respectively. When calculated, FSC had an underpayment of net ICTI of $8.3 and $8.5 million for the fiscal first and second quarters of 2016, respectively. This calculates to a dividend distributions payout ratio of 77% and 76% for the fiscal first and second quarters of 2016, respectively. Simply put, both quarters had material underpayments of net ICTI. If fact, these quarterly percentages calculate to the largest quarterly underpayments of net ICTI that FSC has recorded since the company's first quarter of operations back in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2008. I believe this is a very positive trend regarding FSC's near-term dividend sustainability. I believe the results from TEST 1 are very important for two main reasons. First, as stated in an earlier section of the article, FSC is required to distribute at least 90% of the company's annual net ICTI to remain in RIC compliance. This is known as FSC's ADR. Second, as will be shown shortly, FSC's net ICTI for the fiscal first and second quarters of 2016 was notably higher than the company's NII. As shown in Table 1 above, FSC reported net ICTI of $0.235 and $0.238 per share for the fiscal first and second quarters of 2016, respectively. To compare FSC's net ICTI to the company's NII over the prior two fiscal quarters, Table 2 is provided below. (Source: Table created entirely by myself, partially using FSC data obtained from the SEC's EDGAR Database [link provided below Table 1]) Using Table 2 above as a reference, FSC had NII of $0.177 and $0.170 per share for the fiscal first and second quarters of 2016, respectively (see red reference "(B / E)"). As stated above, FSC had net ICTI of $0.235 and $0.238 per share for the fiscal first and second quarters of 2016, respectively. If market participants ONLY looked at FSC's NII over the prior two fiscal quarters, one could come to the concussion the company has slightly overpaid its dividend distributions when based on GAAP methodologies. However, as shown in TEST 1 above, FSC has actually materially underpaid the company's dividend distributions when based on IRC methodologies. When deciding which methodology (GAAP versus IRC) to base one's dividend sustainability metrics off of, I always choose IRC figures over GAAP figures unless management specifically states otherwise. In some instances, a company's GAAP versus IRC figures are relatively similar. However, as was the case with FSC over the past two fiscal quarters, there has been a notable "de-coupling" between the two sets of figures. Again, I currently believe FSC's net ICTI figures "trump" the company's NII figures when it comes to its near-term dividend sustainability. Now let us take this analysis a step further and perform TEST 2. TEST 2 - Cumulative UTI Coverage of Quarterly Dividend Distributions Ratio Analysis: - See Red References "F, H, (H / F)" in Table 1 Above Next to the March 31, 2016, Column Once again using Table 1 above as a reference, I take FSC's "cumulative undistributed UTI" figure (see red reference "H") and divide this amount by the quarterly "distributions to stockholders from net ICTI" figure (see red reference "F"). From this calculation, FSC's "cumulative UTI coverage of quarterly dividend distributions ratio" is obtained (see red reference "(H / F)"). The higher this ratio is, the more positive the results regarding FSC's near-term dividend sustainability. Basically, this ratio shows the amount of cumulative UTI covering the current quarter's dividend distributions. Continuing to use Table 1 as a reference, FSC had a cumulative UTI balance of $0.5 million at the end of the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015. Again, this figure includes the cumulative true-down net ICTI adjustments totaling ($10.3) million during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015 (discussed earlier). Since cumulative UTI is a "running balance," this figure is always impacted by any prior period adjustments being recorded in a current quarter. One should note FSC's cumulative UTI balance has been (and continues to be) materially higher when compared to the company's cumulative undistributed NII (deficit) balance. As such, this is yet another reason why I believe net ICTI figures should always be analyzed in any BDC's dividend sustainability analysis. In addition, I believe IRC metrics provide evidence/support for any potential "special periodic" dividends being declared (when the spillback provision is not utilized). Confirmation of FSC's cumulative UTI balance equaling the amount provided in Table 1 above (off $1,000 due to rounding) was provided in the following disclosure within the company's 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ending 3/31/2016 (all disclosed figures in '000's): "â€¦As of September 30, 2015, the components of accumulated undistributed income on a tax basis were as follows: Undistributed ordinary income, net $462; Net Realized Capital Losses ($154,653)â€¦" Having an inverse correlation to the quarterly underpayment of net ICTI shown in TEST 1, FSC had a cumulative UTI coverage of quarterly dividend distributions ratio of 0.00 as of 9/30/2015. In my opinion, considering TEST 2 on a standalone basis, this provides further evidence supporting FSC's monthly dividend per share rate decrease which began in March 2015. Simply put, FSC continued to have a cumulative undistributed taxable deficit ("UTD") balance over the past several years leading up to the March 2015 dividend reduction. As such, a portion of FSC's annual dividend distributions were classified as a "return of capital" ("ROC") for the tax years 2011-2014. However, it should also be noted FSC's cumulative UTD balance continued to decrease (less of a negative balance) during fiscal year 2015. As highlighted above, FSC's cumulative UTD balance actually swung to a cumulative UTI balance as of 9/30/2015, even after accounting for the cumulative net ICTI true-down adjustments totaling ($10.3) million. Now let us take a look at what occurred at the end of FSC's fiscal first and second quarters of 2016. FSC had a cumulative UTI balance of $8.7 and $17.3 million at the end of the fiscal first and second quarters of 2016, respectively. It had a cumulative UTI coverage of quarterly dividend distributions ratio of 0.32, and 0.64 as of 12/31/2015 and 3/31/2016, respectively. As such, FSC has quickly increased this ratio over the last two fiscal quarters to a notable surplus. I believe this should be seen as a very positive trend regarding FSC's near-term dividend sustainability. As important, I also project FSC's net ICTI for the fiscal third quarter of 2016 (quarter ending 6/30/2016) will be near, at, or above the company's dividend distributions for the same time frame. For the fiscal third quarter of 2016, I am projecting FSC will have dividend distributions of approximately $26 million. When looking at the results from TEST 1 and TEST 2, I believe the probability of FSC being able to maintain the company's monthly dividend distributions rate has increased when compared to performing this type of analysis over the prior several years. To sum up the information in this article, two dividend sustainability tests were performed on FSC. These tests were based on FSC's net ICTI and cumulative UTI figures which are based on IRC methodologies. These tests also showed compelling evidence as to why market participants need to consider a BDC's net ICTI when it comes to its dividend distributions, not solely NII. TEST 1 provided the following information in regards to FSC's net ICTI for the prior two fiscal quarters: FSC's Net ICTI for Fiscal Q1 2016 and Fiscal Q2 2016, Respectively: $0.235 and $0.238 Per Share FSC's Net ICTI Payout Ratio for Fiscal Q1 2016 and Q2 2016, Respectively: 77% and 76% Simply put, when based on IRC methodologies, FSC materially underpaid the company's dividend distributions during the fiscal first and second quarters of 2016. This was in direct contrast to FSC reporting NII of $0.177 and $0.170 per share for the fiscal first and second quarters of 2016, respectively. I believe it is very important for readers to understand this difference. I currently believe FSC's net ICTI figures"trump" the company's NII figures when it comes to its near-term dividend sustainability. This detailed analysis presented above explained why. Next, TEST 2 provided the following information in regards to FSC's cumulative UTI at the end of the prior three fiscal quarters: FSC's Cumulative UTI as of 9/30/2015, 12/31/2015 and 3/31/2016, Respectively: $0.5, $8.7 and $17.3 million FSC's Cumulative UTI Coverage of Quarterly Dividend Distributions Ratio as of 9/30/2015, 12/31/2015 and 3/31/2016, Respectively: 0.00, 0.32 and 0.64 When looking at the results from TEST 1 and TEST 2 (based on IRC methodologies), I believe the probability of FSC being able to maintain the company's monthly dividend distributions rate of $0.06 per share over the foreseeable future is high (80%). I believe this should be seen as a positive trend. As such, I am projecting FSC will declare the following monthly dividends when the company reports quarterly earnings in August 2016: Dividend for September 2016: $0.06 per share Dividend for October 2016: $0.06 per share Dividend for November 2016: $0.06 per share Due to the reduced distribution level which began in March 2015, including the fact FSC had an additional "cushion" per se regarding the company's cumulative UTI balance of $17.3 million as of 3/31/2016, I believe the probability of the company declaring a minor, special periodic dividend during 2016 is modest (50%). I remain somewhat cautious with this probability due to the notion FSC may elect to use the IRC spillback provision regarding the company's cumulative UTI. My BUY, SELL or HOLD Recommendation: As stated at the beginning of this article, a company's dividend sustainability is only one factor to consider when choosing a possible equity investment. As such, this article now provides a list of the positive and negative factors to consider when determining if FSC is currently undervalued or overvalued). In my opinion, the following positive factors/catalysts should be highlighted for existing and potential FSC shareholders: 1) stock price continues to trade at an excessively material discount to net asset value ("NAV") as of 3/31/2016; currently a (42.37%) discount; 2) current annualized yield of 15.00% (with a high probability of stable dividends over the foreseeable future); 3) management has continued to reiterate the company has not asked for shareholder approval to issue shares of common stock below CURRENT NAV; 4) low remaining exposure to the oil and gas sector; 5) continued double-digit annualized yield within FSC's joint venture ("JV"), "Senior Loan Fund JV 1" (SLF JV 1) (including the fact this JV still is not fully capitalized); 6) recent reduction in base management fees from 2.00% of total assets less cash to 1.75% (step in the right direction); 7) recent price increases for most middle market ("MM") loans as most types of global/U.S. yields have continued to decrease along with a decrease in high-yield debt volatility (a positive sector factor); and 8) recent notable share repurchases by the company itself (3.9 million shares during fiscal Q2 2016 and 1.9 million shares during April 2016). However, the following cautionary/negative factors should cause heightened awareness for existing and potential FSC shareholders: 1) continued low NII per share figures when compared to most BDC peers (mainly due to a rise in non-accruals and litigation costs over the past year); 2) recent low loan originations when compared to historical averages (negatively impacts NII); 3) continued modest to material depreciation on several control/non-control investments; and 4) ongoing litigation involving FSC's executive management team/officers (several class action lawsuits have been filed where plaintiffs have alleged the defendants knowingly/fraudulently inflated asset valuations of several of FSC's portfolio companies prior to Fifth Street Asset Management's (NASDAQ: FSAM ) initial public offering). In regards to this last negative factor, it should be noted plaintiffs are not disputing "current" valuations but "prior" valuations during 2014. This is important for readers to understand in regards to FSC's current/future NAV prospects. FSC recently closed at $4.80 per share as of 6/15/2016. This was a ($3.53) per share discount to FSC's NAV of $8.33 per share as of 3/31/2016. This calculates to a price to NAV ratio of 0.5763 or a discount of (42.37%). From the analysis provided within this article, including all factors/catalysts listed above, I currently rate FSC as a SELL when the company's stock price is trading at less than a (25%) discount to NAV as of 3/31/2016, a HOLD when trading at or greater than a (25%) but less than a (35%) discount to NAV as of 3/31/2016, and a BUY when trading at or greater than a (35%) discount to NAV as of 3/31/2016. As such, I currently rate FSC as a BUY. I believe all of the negative factors associated with FSC are already "priced in" the company's current valuation while most of the positive factors/catalysts are not. My current price target for FSC is approximately $6.25 per share. This is currently the price where my recommendation would change to a SELL. When calculated, this would be price appreciation of 30% from FSC's current valuation. Final Note: On 6/15/2016, I initiated a position in FSC at a weighted average purchase price of $4.805 per share. This trade was disclosed to readers, in "real time," via the "StockTalks" feature of Seeking Alpha. Each investor's BUY, SELL or HOLD decision is based on one's risk tolerance, time horizon and dividend income goals. My personal recommendation will not fit each reader's current investing strategy.
