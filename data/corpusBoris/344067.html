Ron Paul Exposes Conservatives' Budget Plans As Big Spending & Anti-Liberty | Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! Submitted by Ron Paul via The Ron Paul Institute for Peace & Prosperity, According to a recent poll, 73 percent of all Americans oppose increases in federal spending. Since this anti-government spending sentiment is a major reason Republicans control the House and Senate, one would expect the Republican Congress to hold the line on, or even cut, government spending. Yet, despite the Republican leadership’s rhetoric about "fiscal responsibility," this year’s House Republican budget spends $104 billion more than the GOP’s 2013 budget. Some conservatives, most notably the Heritage Foundation, have criticized the GOP budget. Heritage and the conservative House Republican Study Committee (RSC) have both prepared conservative alternatives to the official Republican budgets. Unfortunately, neither Heritage nor the RSC budgets meaningfully reduce federal spending. Conservative efforts to reduce the size of government are handicapped by their love affair with the military-industrial complex. Since the Pentagon’s budget makes up the largest category of “discretionary” spending, it seems logical that a serious balanced budget plan would reduce spending on militarism. Yet many of the same conservatives who (rightly) criticize the Republicans for refusing to cut spending not only oppose cuts to the Pentagon budget, they actually call for increases in military spending! These conservatives refuse to admit that the trillions spent on “regime change” overseas have not only failed to turn the targeted counties into Jeffersonian republics but have actually empowered groups like ISIS. Conservative support for ever-increasing spending on militarism undercuts their efforts to end corporate welfare. Much of the so-called defense budget is wasted on boondoggles like the F-35 fighter that only defend the lifestyles of defense contractors and their lobbyists. Despite insisting on increased military spending, the Heritage and RSC budgets both, at least on paper, eliminate the deficit in less than ten years. These budgets contain some other positive elements. For example, the RSC budget calls for an audit of the Federal Reserve. Both budgets repeal Obamacare and provide the American people with much needed tax relief. The good features of the conservative budgets do not cancel out their flaws. For one thing, neither of the conservative budgets actually cuts spending. Instead, they both use the old DC trick of cutting projected increases in spending. Only in DC could budgets that increase domestic spending be considered a “radical attack on the welfare state.” The fundamental flaw in the conservative budgets is philosophical: like much of modern American conservatism, the budget accepts the notion that that the American government is both constitutionally authorized to, and capable of, running the economy, running our lives, and running the world. Hence the “conservative” budgets do little or nothing to scale back the federal role in education, housing, welfare, or commerce. Conservative budgets reform welfare programs by giving the states more authority and flexibility in administering the programs. This may make marginal improvements in the programs, but it does not make the welfare state moral or constitutional. It also does not make government welfare more efficient or compassionate than private charity. Similarly, while conservatives promise entitlement reforms that give individuals greater control, they refuse to grant young people the option to care for themselves by opting-out of the government entitlement system. If America is going to avoid a major economic crisis, government spending and debt must be reduced. However, budgets that merely tinker around the edges of the welfare-warfare state, or only reduce the rate of spending increases, merely postpone the day of reckoning. Only a budget that brings the troops home, shuts down unconstitutional agencies, ends all corporate welfare, and begins unwinding our welfare and entitlement programs will ensure future generations enjoy liberty, peace, and prosperity.

Fuck them, they call him for not giving staright answers and they cover up what he does say. He was clearly pissed off with gayboy obummer tho, as he held up his arm rather than let obama put his arm around him. Shrugged his shoulder away from an obama pat on the shoulder on the way out too. Fuck obama and fuck cnbc propaganda. Mon, 03/21/2016 - 14:48 | 7342085 I need more asshats Has Ron gone crazy?

Now they have Trump who they will try to fuck over the same way. Who will replace Trump?

Mon, 03/21/2016 - 15:09 | 7342214 Mini-Me People say they want spending reduced, but they don't really mean it.  How do I know?  Because Americans keep sending back to Congress the a-holes who have a track record for saying one thing and doing another.   People don't want their Social Security and Medicare checks to stop.  People on EBT want their cards replenished every month.  The MIC needs its worthless military gizmos to be funded.  And then there's Big Pharma, Big Ag, the Wall St. cabal, and countless other parasitic organizations.   The madness won't stop until the dollar is destroyed. and the Fed is doing its best to bring that about.  Time for the big reset.  Couldn't come soon enough, as far as I'm concerned. Mon, 03/21/2016 - 15:12 | 7342231 Encroaching Darkness joego1 nailed it: the GOPe used every dirty trick known and invented some new ones just to keep Ron Paul's name from being placed in nomination. They knew Mittens had all the charisma of a wet used athletic sock and if Ron Paul was a choice he would win. So drive his delegates anywhere but the convention hall, until the nominations were closed! Change the rules while those delegates are hijacked and unavailable! So much fraud in one event is hard to imagine... And yes, the GOPe are at it again. Only this time, they are being seen through for the liars and cheats they are. If Trump wins a majority and is denied the nomination, I think the GOP will fail to continue as an organized force in politics. Which might be the best possible outcome, but we shall see: the collapse doesn't lack for reasons / drivers, it only lacks critical energy, and that is coming.
