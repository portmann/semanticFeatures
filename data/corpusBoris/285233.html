(More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. Construction spending for January 2005 through October 2015 has been revised upward to correct a processing error in the tabulation of data on private residential improvement spending. Could this mean GDP has been understated? Construction spending currently is around 6% of GDP. This may be a boring subject to many - construction spending. This past week the U.S. Census unveiled a "processing error". The statement in the November 2015 construction spending release from the U.S. Census Bureau: In the November 2015 press release, monthly and annual estimates for private residential, total private, total residential and total construction spending for January 2005 through October 2015 have been revised to correct a processing error in the tabulation of data on private residential improvement spending. From the above graphic, it is clear that the significant change was that some monies were NOT included in construction spending since 2014 and especially during the 2014 calendar year itself. Simply, the area under the curve improved, meaning GDP may have been understated - could be by as much as 0.3% to 0.4% some quarters. I say MAY because the BEA has to allocate expenditures, and the monies could have been put in the wrong pocket (but still accounted for within GDP). The graph below shows the fraction of GDP attributable to construction. [Note that this is the new construction spending data against the existing GDP data.] At this point, I would not read too much into this annual revision of construction spending. In any event, construction spending annual rate of growth still exceeds 10% for much of 2015.
