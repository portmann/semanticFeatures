Thank You, Consumers: GDP Gaining Ground In Second Quarter | Seeking Alpha Personal spending was higher than originally thought and brought Q2-2015 GDP to a very solid annualized rate of 3.9%. The American consumer was resilient in the second quarter and brought personal consumption expenditures about 50 basis points higher over the prior month to 3.6%. A large number of businesses contributed to growth in the quarter as nonresidential fixed investments were driven 90 basis points higher to 4.1%. Though lacking from the second quarter of 2014, the gross domestic product, GDP, final reading for the second quarter of this year stands out as particularly strong given many unfavorable circumstances. The Bureau of Labor Statistics noted that personal spending was higher than originally thought and brought Q2-2015 GDP to a very solid annualized rate of 3.9%. Higher spending by the average U.S. consumer led to overall final sales in the reading to grow to 3.9% for an upward revision of about 40 basis points. The chart below shows the quarterly changes in the GDP rate since 2012, and although this reading is not the highest, it is certainly among the strongest. Amazingly, the American consumer was resilient in the second quarter and brought personal consumption expenditures about 50 basis points higher over the prior month to 3.6%. It is interesting to note that the service-spending component, which reflects a rise in the spending levels of travel, was revised about 70 basis points higher in the quarter to 2.7%. However, the revisions made in goods spending were rather mixed, as durables led the category lower by 20 basis points as consumer spending on automobiles shrunk for a total durables rise of 8.0%. Non-durables, on the other hand, continue to be doing well as the component was revised 20 basis points higher to 4.3%. Another telltale sign that the consumer is making a strong comeback is evident in the 150-basis-point upward revision to residential fixed investments, which is currently at a reading of 9.3%. This data is incredibly relieving and may help to carry shares of the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEARCA: XLY ) going into the fall and holiday seasons. It is great to see the consumer making such a huge comeback, but it is even better to see hope among business activity. A large number of businesses contributed to growth in the quarter as nonresidential fixed investment, or capital expenditures, was driven 90 basis points higher to 4.1% thanks to a rising in spending on structures. Another positive in the business report is related to inventory growth, however we know this is not entirely a strong point. While rising inventories may show that businesses are becoming more confident, it is a problem when inventories build up due to lower sales which in-turn clogs up with supply chain. However, given how strong personal spending appears to be on the consumer level, this rise in inventories seems justified. This data may actually lead to stronger details in outlook on the inventory reports over the coming months. Overall, it is quite a relief to see how the second quarter managed to not only meet tough expectations from economists, but exceed them as well. This is quite a strong rebound from the dismal activity in the first quarter of 2015, where GDP was forecasted to come in negative at first, but then to a growth rate of 0.6%. Judging by the manufacturing reports, PMI readings, and housing data so far in September, it appears as though the third quarter is less robust and should come in around 2.0% according to economists. However, judging by stronger housing activity, I would expect this 2.0% is far too conservative and I believe the real number will be closer to 3.0% provided that oil prices do not cause a broader impact.
