Retail ETFs On Fire After Robust Results, Upbeat View | Seeking Alpha As the Q4 earnings season is winding down, the retail sector is grabbing attention with releases from its major players last week. Most of the retailers managed to beat our earnings and revenue estimates amid a slowing global economy, a stronger U.S. dollar and weakness in oil. In particular, better-than-expected earnings from retailers like J.C. Penney (NYSE: JCP ), Macy's (NYSE: M ), Best Buy (NYSE: BBY ) and Home Depot (NYSE: HD ), and upbeat guidance from Target (NYSE: TGT ) and Lowe's (NYSE: LOW ) spread optimism into the whole sector, and drove the stocks higher. However, disappointing results from Nordstrom (NYSE: JWN ) and Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) weighed on the sector's performance. One of the leading department store retailers, J.C. Penney, emerged as the real champion in the Q4 earnings season as the stock popped up 14.7% and hit a new 52-week high of $9.71 following blockbuster fourth-quarter fiscal 2015 results on February 25 after the market closed. The company came up with a huge beat of 77.3% on earnings and a mild beat of 0.02% on revenues. Additionally, J.C. Penney expects to post its first annual profit in five years in 2016 (read: Retail ETFs to Watch Ahead of Q4 Results ). The big-box retailer, Target, also hit a new 52-week high of $78.97 in the last trading session, while its shares have jumped 6% since its fiscal fourth-quarter 2015 earnings announcement on February 24. Though the retailer lagged our estimates for earnings by a couple of cents and for revenues by $0.157 billion, it impressed investors with its upbeat guidance for the current fiscal year. The company guided earnings per share in the range of $1.15-$1.25 for the ongoing fiscal first quarter and $5.20-$5.40 for fiscal 2016. The mid-points were ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.21 for the first quarter and $5.16 for the full fiscal at the time of the earnings release. The second-largest department store retailer, Macy's, has seen share price appreciation of 5.8% to date post its earnings announcement on February 23. The company reported earnings per share of $2.09 and revenues of $8.869 billion that outpaced our estimates by 23 cents and $0.092 billion, respectively. For fiscal 2016, the company guided earnings per share of $3.80-$3.90, the lower end of which was much above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.72 at the time of the earnings release. Home Depot, the world's largest home improvement retailer, cheered investors with better-than-expected fiscal Q4 results thanks to mild weather and an improving housing market. The company beat on earnings by 7 cents and on revenues by $0.619 billion. For fiscal 2016, Home Depot expects earnings per share to increase 12%-13% to $6.12-$6.18 and revenues to grow 5.1%-6%, with same-store sales growth of 3.7%-4.5%. Driven by solid results, the company also raised its quarterly dividend by 17% to 69 cents per share and announced a $5 billion share buyback plan. The stock has gained nearly 2.7% to-date post its earnings announcement on February 23. The second-largest home improvement retailer, Lowe's, reported in-line fourth-quarter fiscal 2015 earnings but beat on revenues by $0.182 billion. Moreover, the company provided an upbeat guidance for fiscal 2016. The company expects sales to grow 6%, with 4% growth in comparable sales and earnings per share of $4.00. The stock has added 1.8% to-date since its earnings release on February 24. The largest U.S. electronics chain, Best Buy, topped our fourth-quarter fiscal 2016 earnings estimate by 13 cents, but fell short of our revenue estimate by $0.049 billion. For the ongoing first quarter of fiscal 2017, the company expects earnings per share in the range of 31-35 cents. Shares of BBY has gained 0.5% since its earnings announcement on February 25. The specialty retailer, Nordstrom, is the major loser as the stock has tumbled nearly 6.7% following lackluster fourth-quarter fiscal 2015 results. The company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings by a nickel and for revenues by $0.091 billion. In addition, the company issued disappointing earnings per share guidance of $3.10-$3.35 for fiscal 2016, the upper-end of which was well below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.45 at the time of the earnings release. Nordstrom expects sales to increase 3.5%-5.5% and comps to grow in a flat to 2% growth range. The stock is modestly down 0.4% since the earnings announcement on February 18 after-market close. Shares of Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, fell about 3% after the company missed on revenues by $0.687 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and issued a weak revenue outlook, pointing to continued struggle with lower traffic and decelerating e-commerce. The company lowered its revenue growth projection for fiscal 2017 from 3%-4% projected earlier to relatively flat. It also provided earnings per share guidance of $4.00-$4.30 for the full fiscal and 80-95 cents for fiscal first quarter of 2017 (read: Consumer ETFs in Focus as Wal-Mart Disappoints ). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the full year and the ongoing quarter were $4.56 and 88 cents, respectively, at the time of the earnings release. However, earnings per share came in at $1.49 for the fiscal fourth quarter, above the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents. The stock is up 0.6% to-date post earnings results on February 18. Robust performances and bullish guidance from most retailers offset the handful of weak earnings releases, leading to a rally in retail ETFs over the past 10 days. Investors seeking to take advantage of the ongoing rally in the space could consider the following three ETFs given the power-packed earnings releases. Any of these could be excellent choices given that these have a Zacks ETF Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), suggesting their continued outperformance in the months ahead. SPDR S&P Retail ETF (NYSEARCA: XRT ) This product tracks the S&P Retail Select Industry Index, holding 100 securities in its basket.

PowerShares Retail Fund (NYSEARCA: PMR ) This retail fund provides a diversified exposure across various market caps with 45% in large caps, 43% in small caps and the rest in mid caps.

The ETF charges 63 bps in fees per year. In total, the product holds 29 securities with none accounting for more than 5.88% of assets.

PMR is up 8.5% in the past 10 days and has a Zacks ETF Rank of 2. The string of earnings and revenue beat has allowed retail ETFs to surpass the broader market fund by wide margins in the same period. This is likely to continue given the solid trends in the space. This is especially true as consumer spending has started regaining momentum on a slow but recovering economy, better job and wage prospects, and low oil prices.
