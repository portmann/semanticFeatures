TAL Education: Another Good Quarter, But Margins Still Under Pressure - TAL Education Group (NYSE:XRS) | Seeking Alpha TAL Education reported fiscal Q2 2016 EPS and revenue ahead of views and guided fiscal Q3 revenues higher. Operating margin remains under pressure on increased spending; ASPs down Y/Y due to promotions and geographic expansion. M&A activity positive for long-term growth prospects. I remain bullish on TAL Education but prefer EDU due to lower valuation, top line growth acceleration and margin stabilization/expansion potential. TAL Education (NYSE: XRS ) delivered fiscal Q2 earnings and revenue ahead of the analyst consensus. Enrollment growth was encouraging as the company continues to expand geographically, while promotions and the before-mentioned expansion have led to lower ASPs. The company has been active on the M&A front recently and has acquired minority stakes in two education companies in late September, which bodes well for its future growth prospects. I remain bullish on TAL's long-term growth prospects but prefer New Oriental (NYSE: EDU ) at the moment due to its top line growth acceleration, margin stabilization and expansion potential as well as the lower valuation and a stronger balance sheet. TAL's fiscal Q2 revenues and EPS came in above the analyst consensus. Revenue growth remained above 40% for the third straight quarter and the company guided for fiscal Q3 revenue growth in the 36% to 39% range. The growth rates are even better when looking in local currency (TAL reports its earnings in U.S. dollars). Management's beat-and-raise guidance policy indicates that the growth rate in fiscal Q3 should be closer to or even slightly above 40% (the average top line beat in the last 12 quarters was 2.9 percentage points compared to the mid-point of management guidance). It is also important to note that enrollment growth has accelerated for the fourth straight quarter in fiscal Q2 (from 32% in fiscal Q1 2015 to 55% in the most recent quarter). However, the growth was achieved through geographical expansion which carry lower ASPs, and this has negatively affected the blended ASPs. Small class ASP declined 5.3% Y/Y on summer promotions in Beijing, one-on-one ASP was down 17.4% Y/Y and online APS was down 3.1% Y/Y. The mix of promotions and geographic expansion has clearly negatively affected ASPs, but the overall growth rates remain strong on enrollment growth acceleration. On the other hand, EDU's ASPs in the quarter was up 3% Y/Y, which points to continued pricing strength and this is the first reason I prefer EDU over TAL Education at the moment. TAL also acquired Firstleap Education for an undisclosed sum and a minority stake in Phoenix E-learning (32% stake for $30 million). Firstleap provides tutoring services in English for children aged 2 to 15 through 60 learning centers and its online platform. TAL's management believes that Firstleap has a strong O2O platform and that it should complement its offerings. The acquisition should lead to cross-selling opportunities in addition to enhancing the company's O2O platform. These bolt-on acquisitions are a good way for the company to increase its exposure and to ramp-up its online and O2O offerings. In addition to Y/Y ASP declines, another negative side of the report was that the non-GAAP operating margin was down 250 basis points Y/Y, which represented the fifth straight quarter of Y/Y margin declines. The company is making investments to support growth and geographical expansion and I think that investors should not be concerned, as margins are a necessary sacrifice of increased expansion. However, this is the second reason that I prefer EDU, since its margins are likely to bottom in the following quarters and start expanding in fiscal 2017 (you can read more about the reasons I like EDU in my latest article ). A look at TAL's adjusted P/E chart reveals that the stock is trading near the high end of its historical valuation range. I stated in my previous articles that I expect the company to trade at an elevated P/E ratio due to strong top line growth and margin contraction, but I do not expect the P/E ratio to expand significantly above the current levels. Given the expectations for EPS growth in the 25% to 30% range in the next two years, the upside could still be significant if XRS' valuation stays within this range. Applying a P/E ratio of 30 to next year's earnings estimates gets us to a PT of $48. Source: TAL Education earnings reports, Yahoo! Finance However, as I stated earlier in the article, I prefer EDU at the moment. Aside from the ASP strength and margin stabilization arguments laid out above, EDU's top line growth acceleration and margin expansion potential could lead to P/E expansion, while its significantly lower valuation and a more robust balance sheet (north of $1 billion in cash and equivalents and no debt versus TAL's $535 million in cash and equivalents and $225 million in debt) provide a certain margin of safety that TAL does not have at the moment. I expect both EDU and TAL to perform well in the following years, but regard EDU as a better and safer pick at the moment. TAL Education's growth story remains intact and I expect that the stock will continue to perform well in the long-term, but I currently prefer EDU on lower valuation, margin stabilization and expansion potential and a more robust balance sheet. TAL's investments in geographic expansion and M&A activity bode well for its long-term growth prospects and the stock should keep trading at a premium over EDU, but leaves it more vulnerable if growth decelerates in fiscal 2017, while EDU's growth acceleration and margin expansion could cause TAL's growth premium to dissipate to a large extent in the following quarters.
