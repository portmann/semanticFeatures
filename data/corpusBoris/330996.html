India Set For A Consumption Surge Next Year Due To A $16 Billion Pay Hike Bonanza For Government Servants | Seeking Alpha Indian economy remains fundamentally strong despite rocky stock market conditions. The large pay hike for around 10 million government employees next year will have a strong fiscal stimulus effect. Key risks are further deterioration of global economy and increasing risk aversion towards emerging market assets. The Indian stock market has been facing rocky times of late due to a combination of global risk aversion, China slowdown, falling oil prices and NPA issues at its state owned banks. The stock market has technically entered a bear market, with a fall of 20% from its peak value reached last year. However I do not think that the fundamentals of the stock market have changed radically, to alter my bullish view on the stocks. The Indian stock market has performed admirably when you compare it to other emerging markets such as China, Brazil, Russia, Indonesia, South Africa and others. The currency is stable and the fiscal deficit is well under control. Major structural reforms are ongoing in many sectors such as ports, power, mining, roads, railways etc. Financial reforms have already borne fruit, with millions of new bank accounts being opened and a large number of banks being given licenses to operate in India's banking sector. While the Indian stock market may fall more if global issues become more acute, I would take it as an opportunity to buy stocks at discounted prices. The NPA cycle is peaking with the central bank taking a stringent stance against the bad debt and forcing many banks to recognize NPAs. Earnings will also be on an upswing, now that most of the commodity companies have more or less reached a bottom. Many companies have reported higher margins due to fall in input costs. India crude oil imports have fallen by 45% , leading to a net gain of more than $50 billion in the last year for the Indian economy. The government is all set to give a 15-20% pay increase to government officials, which should lead to fiscal stimulus of sorts. This will lead to increased consumption and investment going forward. I remain optimistic about the long term prospects. India increases the salaries and wages of its more than 10 million government servants after every 7-8 years through a "Pay Commission". The last Pay Commission was in 2008 and the new one which is known as the 7th Pay Commission was formed in 2015. The salaries of employees not only directly working for the government, but also government owned organizations such as state owned banks, railways etc. also get increased. The pensions of millions of retired government officials will also get increased, as per the Pay Commission recommendations. This salary hike will start getting implemented from the next fiscal year i.e. from April 2016 to March 2017. The salary hike is ~23%, which will mean an increased government expenditure of $16 billion. Besides this state governments will also have to increase salaries (though in a staggered manner). This could lead to an even greater boost to consumption. The Indian government has gained a large amount of money due to the crude oil price crash, which will mean that the fiscal deficit will stay under control at below 4%. While some analysts have criticized this increased expenditure, this payment hike was inevitable from the political viewpoint. Also inflation in India is quite high, so salaries have to be increased. It can be debated that the higher salaries should lead to better accountability by the government officials, but that is a different discussion altogether. A part of this salary hike will also be recovered by the government through increased income taxes and indirect consumption taxes, so the total impact on government finances will not be as big as it looks on the surface. In the past couple of years, rural consumption in India has gone down while urban consumption has gone up, as the government policies have reduced the massive fiscal flows towards the rural areas. The rural employment schemes have seen less budget expenditure and the minimum support prices (NYSE: MSP ) of crops have also not seen a major increase. This has led to a slowdown in rural wage growth and consumption. On the other hand, urban consumption has gone up mainly due to fall in food and fuel prices. The best indicator of this change has been the increase in four wheeler car sales and the tepid performance of tractor and two wheeler sales . The last two years have also seen less rainfall, leading to drought like conditions in many parts of the country. I think that the Pay Commission effect will be seen across the country both in rural and urban areas, as government employees are present uniformly in both the areas. India's fast moving consumer goods ("FMCG") industry and the consumer durable sector should benefit. Major players such as Asian Paints, Bata, ITC and Indian arms of Unilever and Proctor and Gamble should be key beneficiaries. Auto and real estate companies can also expect a boost, with higher disposable income in the hands of millions of government officials. In fact, I have already seen a real estate company market a project exclusively for government servants to take advantage of the new policy. a) Lower spending on capital assets - With most of the Indian corporates under stress due to high debt, the Indian government has provided most of the investment over the last one year. The government has substantially ramped up spending on capital assets such as roads, railways, power and other infrastructure projects. With a large part of the government funds set to go towards salaries, the pace for higher infrastructure spending is reduced next year. The government will have to depend on the private sector to ramp up investment growth in anticipation of higher consumption next year. b) Bad debt issues with the banking sector - The bad debt in the books on Indian banks (particularly government ones) has become the biggest challenge facing the Indian economy. The central bank has become extremely strict and forced most banks to recognize the bad debt. This has led to a sharp increase in the gross NPAs of all major banks . While I think this will cause short term pain, it is good from the long term view as it will force the banks to clean their books and will help the lending cycle to grow again. The Indian stock market has technically fallen into a bear market but the fundamentals remain strong unlike other emerging markets such as China and Brazil, which are facing structural problems without easy solutions. India is getting an annual bonanza of more than $50 billion every year due to lower crude oil prices. The government is implementing market friendly policies and regulations and optimism remains high amongst the public. While India's democracy does not allow for the reforms to move fast, they do get implemented though slowly. There is consensus behind implementing the goods and services ("GST") law over the next year or so. This will lead to higher GDP growth and increase revenue for the government, by removing inefficiencies and reducing corruption. I would continue to add to my Indian stock positions, as it remains the one strong stock market in a world of slow growth.
