Raise the Gas Tax? Proposals for Highway Spending Go Outside the Lines - Real Time Economics - WSJ President Barack Obama last summer called on Congress to close tax loopholes and use the money to pay for infrastructure projects. With lawmakers once again staring down a deadline to extend the Highway Trust Fund, experts across Washington are rolling out proposals to help break the logjam. Some might even be creative enough to shake loose money without requiring lawmakers to raise the deficit. Congress last summer passed legislation to fund highway and mass-transit projects through May 31 , a 10-month patch that did little to resolve a longer-term spending and revenue mismatch. Once again, the Highway Trust Fund, which pays for highway and mass-transit projects, could exhaust its reserves. And already this year, Democrats and Republicans have clashed over infrastructure spending . A new report from the Brookings Institution’s Hamilton Project highlights falling spending on the country’s infrastructure and recommends a series of measures to improve roads, bridges, ports and other transportation nodes. “The federal governmentâ€™s investment in infrastructure is declining, budgetary resources for discretionary programs are becoming even scarcer, and political gridlock is increasing,” said authors Roger Altman, who served at the Treasury Department in the Clinton administration, andÂ Aaron Klein and Alan Krueger, both former Obama administration Treasury officials. Indeed, Congressional Budget Office data show that by one measure, such spending by all governments across the U.S. peaked in 2003. The trio’s proposals include a handful of immediate steps alongside longer-term plans. For example, they call for: â€¢ A 10-fold increase, to $10 billion, in funding under the Transportation Infrastructure FinanceÂ and Innovation Act, a federal program grants, loan guarantees and credits. â€¢ Restoration of the Build America Bonds program, which allows states and localities to receive federal subsidy payments on taxable bonds. Republicans quashed renewal of the program in 2011 . â€¢ Raising the gas tax, indexing it toÂ inflation and allowing it to vary inversely with the price of gasoline. Raising the tax had long been seen as a non-starter politically on Capitol Hill, given Americans’ strong views about gas prices. Â But it doesn’t appear to be out of the question , drawing interest from state and federal lawmakers . The federal gas tax of 18.4 cents per gallon, which has not changed since 1993, would be 30 cents per gallon today if it had kept up with inflation.
