Prospect Capital's Dividend And NAV Sustainability Analysis (Pre Fiscal Q4 2015 Earnings) - Part 1 - Prospect Capital Corporation (NASDAQ:PSEC) | Seeking Alpha Part 1 of this article analyzes PSECâ€™s near-term dividend sustainability by performing four tests based on recent quarterly results. The first two tests analyze PSECâ€™s net investment income and the companyâ€™s cumulative undistributed net investment income which are based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The next two tests analyze PSECâ€™s net investment company taxable income and cumulative undistributed taxable income which are based on Internal Revenue Code methodologies. Summarized results from the four tests performed within this analysis, in regards to PSECâ€™s near-term dividend sustainability, are stated within the â€œConclusions Drawnâ€? section of the article. Part 2 will discuss some additional topics/trends to consider in a general net rising interest rate environment regarding PSECâ€™s future dividend and net asset value sustainability. Author's Note: This two-part article is a very detailed look at Prospect Capital Corp.'s (NASDAQ: PSEC ) dividend and net asset value ("NAV") sustainability. I perform this detailed analysis for readers who anticipate/want such an analysis performed at periodic intervals (demand has continued to remain high). For readers who just want the summarized conclusions/results, I would suggest to scroll down to the "Conclusions Drawn" section at the bottom of the each part of the article. Due to management's recent rhetoric regarding a delay to PSEC's three proposed spin-offs (now trying to be finalized by the end of the calendar year 2015), I believe this dividend and NAV sustainability analysis can be performed at this point in time. The focus of PART 1 of this article is to provide a detailed analysis with supporting documentation (via four tests) on the near-term dividend sustainability of PSEC. This analysis will be provided after a brief overview of PSEC's regulated investment company ("RIC") classification per the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC"). After the discussion of this topic, I will be performing four dividend sustainability tests within PART 1 of this article. The first two tests will focus on PSEC's net investment income ("NII"). These two tests will be termed "TEST 1" and "TEST 2". The next two tests will focus on PSEC's net investment company taxable income ("ICTI"). These two tests will be termed "TEST 3" and "TEST 4". At the end of PART 1 of this article, there will be a conclusion based on the results obtained from TEST 1, TEST 2, TEST 3, and TEST 4 about the near-term dividend sustainability of PSEC. PART 2 transitions to a more "forward-looking" dividend sustainability analysis and will discuss some topics/trends to consider in a general net rising interest rate environment that may counter (or confirm) the evidence obtained within PART 1. PART 2 will also perform an analysis on PSEC's future NAV sustainability. At the end of this two-part article, I will provide my projection regarding PSEC's dividend per share rate for September 2015, October 2015, and November 2015. I will also provide my projection regarding PSEC's NAV per share range over the next several fiscal quarters. I am writing this particular article due to the continued high demand that such an analysis be performed at periodic intervals. Understanding the tax and dividend payout characteristics of PSEC will provide investors with an overall better understanding of the business development company ("BDC") sector as a whole. From reading this article, investors will better understand how a RIC per the IRC comes up with the company's current dividend rate and specific signs when an impending dividend raise or cut would be implemented. Side Note: It should be noted PSEC's fiscal year-end, based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), is June 30th of a given year. In contrast, PSEC's tax year-end, based on IRC methodologies, is August 31st of a given year. Readers should understand there is a two month "gap" per se between PSEC's GAAP fiscal year-end and the company's IRC tax year-end when the analysis is presented below. In prior PSEC articles, I have discussed the company's RIC classification per the IRC in detail. This included specific provisions that PSEC must adhere by to remain in RIC compliance. There is one specific provision relative to PSEC's dividend sustainability analysis. PSEC is required to distribute to shareholders at least 90% of the company's "ICTI" and "net capital gains" (in excess of its "capital loss carryforward" balance; if applicable) in any given tax year in order to be eligible for the tax benefits allowed to a RIC (dividends paid deduction at the corporate level). When these two figures are combined, this comprises PSEC's net ICTI which is also known as the company's annual distribution requirement ("ADR"). There is one specific "exclusion" to this rule which is mentioned later in the article (the "spillback provision"). Readers can look back to the following Main Street Capital Corp.'s (NYSE: MAIN ) article for a further discussion of this topic: PSEC's management team has either stated or implied the company's dividend is mainly based on the following two factors: First Factor: Intend to cover the company's dividend payout level with NII (currently, the company's "minimum expected NII" over the foreseeable future) Second Factor: Intend to cover the company's annual dividend payout level with net ICTI The first factor will focus on PSEC's NII and cumulative undistributed NII and be analyzed via TEST 1 and TEST 2, respectively. The second factor will focus on PSEC's net ICTI and cumulative undistributed taxable income ("UTI") and be analyzed via TEST 3 and TEST 4, respectively. Readers should understand these distinctions as the four tests are presented and analyzed below. First Main Factor - Intend to Cover the Company's Dividend Payout Level with NII: To test management's first main factor, I believe it is necessary to first analyze and discuss PSEC's past quarterly NII figures to see if the company's dividend distributions were covered. This will lead to a better understanding of the overall trends regarding this particular factor and possible future pitfalls that may arise. This includes PSEC using the company's cumulative undistributed NII balance on any quarterly NII overpayments. Table 1 below shows PSEC's NII from the fiscal third quarter of 2015 going back to the company's fiscal first quarter in 2014. Table 1 then compares PSEC's quarterly NII figure to the company's dividend distributions figure showing the quarterly underpayment (overpayment). Table 1 below then shows PSEC's quarterly cumulative undistributed NII (deficit) balance for the same timeframes. (Source: Table created entirely by myself, partially using PSEC data obtained from the SEC's EDGAR Database ) Table 1 will be the main source of information as TEST 1 and TEST 2 are analyzed below. Now let us begin PSEC's near-term dividend sustainability analysis. TEST 1 - Quarterly NII Versus Quarterly Distributions Analysis: - See Red References "C, D, E, (D / C)" in Table 1 Above Next to the March 31, 2015 Column Using Table 1 above as a reference, I take PSEC's quarterly "NII" figure (see red reference "C") and subtract this amount by the quarterly "distributions from NII" figure (see red reference "D"). If PSEC's red reference "C" is greater than the company's red reference "D", then PSEC technically had enough quarterly NII to pay out the company's dividend distributions for a particular quarter. Any excess NII left over, after accounting for the dividend distributions, would be added to PSEC's cumulative undistributed NII (deficit) balance. This particular balance will be further discussed within TEST 2 later in the article. If PSEC's red reference "C" is less than the company's red reference "D", then the company technically did not have enough quarterly NII to pay out its dividend distributions for a particular quarter and must use a portion of the remaining cumulative undistributed NII (deficit) balance to help with the overpayment. Still using Table 1 above as a reference, PSEC had NII of $94.5, $91.3, and $87.4 million for the fiscal first, second, and third quarters of 2015, respectively. In comparison, PSEC had dividend distributions of ($114.3), ($118.2), and ($99.4) million for the fiscal first, second, and third quarters of 2015, respectively. When calculated, PSEC had an overpayment of NII of ($19.8), ($26.9), and ($12.0) million for the fiscal first, second, and third quarters of 2015, respectively (see red reference "(C - D) = E"). This calculates to a dividend distributions payout ratio of 121%, 129%, and 114% for the fiscal first, second, and third quarters of 2015, respectively (see red reference "(D / C)"). As such, I believe it can be determined PSEC materially overpaid the company's NII during the prior three fiscal quarters. When looking at the dividend distributions payout ratio from the fiscal first quarter of 2014 to the fiscal third quarter of 2015, one can see this ratio has gradually increased. In my opinion, considering TEST 1 on a "standalone basis", this evidence helps support PSEC's recent material monthly dividend per share rate reduction which began in February 2015. However, it should also be noted PSEC's dividend distributions payout ratio decreased from 129% during the fiscal second quarter of 2015 to 114% during the fiscal third quarter of 2015. This reduced payout ratio was directly attributable to the new monthly dividend rate of $0.0833 per share (new quarterly dividend rate totaling $0.25 per share). Now let us take this analysis a step further and perform TEST 2. TEST 2 - Cumulative Undistributed NII Coverage of Quarterly Dividend Distributions Ratio Analysis: - See Red References "D, F, (F / D)" in Table 1 Above Next to the March 31, 2015 Column Once again using Table 1 above as a reference, I take PSEC's "cumulative undistributed NII (deficit)" figure (see red reference "F") and divide this amount by the quarterly "distributions from NII" figure (see red reference "D"). From this calculation, PSEC's "cumulative undistributed NII coverage of quarterly dividend distributions ratio" is obtained (see red reference "(F / D)"). The higher this ratio is, the more positive the results regarding PSEC's near-term dividend sustainability. Basically, this ratio shows the amount of cumulative undistributed NII covering the current quarter's dividend distributions (after taking the current month's dividend distributions accrual into account). Continuing to use Table 1 above as a reference, PSEC had a cumulative undistributed NII (deficit) balance of $18.0, ($8.9), and ($20.9) million at the end of the fiscal first, second, and third quarters of 2015, respectively. This considers the fact PSEC had disclosed prior period adjustments to the company's cumulative undistributed NII of $11.0 and ($4.3) million during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2014 and fiscal first quarter of 2015, respectively. These prior period adjustments generally occur when PSEC performs the company's annual tax return (prior misclassifications). Since these specific adjustments were discussed in prior articles, they will not be discussed within this particular analysis. Having an inverse correlation to the material quarterly overpayments of NII shown in TEST 1, PSEC had a cumulative undistributed NII coverage of quarterly dividend distributions ratio of 0.16, (0.08), and (0.21) as of 9/30/2014, 12/31/2014, and 3/31/2015 respectively. As such, this ratio continued to decrease during the fiscal first, second, and third quarters of 2015. When looking at the cumulative undistributed NII (deficit) balance from the fiscal first quarter of 2014 to the fiscal third quarter of 2015, one can see that this balance materially decreased. PSEC had a cumulative undistributed NII balance of $72.7 million at the end of the fiscal first quarter of 2014. As stated earlier, as of 3/31/2015 PSEC's cumulative undistributed NII (deficit) balance was ($20.9) million. As such, this balance decreased ($93.6) million over the past six fiscal quarters. When calculated, PSEC had a cumulative undistributed NII coverage of quarterly dividend distributions ratio of 0.84 as of 9/30/2013. As stated earlier, PSEC had a cumulative undistributed NII coverage of quarterly dividend distributions ratio of (0.21) as of 3/31/2015. When calculated, this ratio decreased (1.05) over the past six fiscal quarters. As of 3/31/2015, this was the lowest cumulative undistributed NII coverage of quarterly dividend distributions ratio I have calculated since I have covered PSEC. In my opinion, considering TEST 2 on a "standalone basis", this evidence helps support PSEC's recent material monthly dividend per share rate reduction which began in February 2015. Since PSEC's quarterly NII "break-even" began to materially decrease beginning in February 2015 (due to the recent dividend cut), it is only prudent to now analyze if PSEC's past NII could have covered the company's newly reduced dividend distributions payout level. To perform this analysis, Table 2 is provided below. (Source: Table created entirely by myself, partially using PSEC data obtained from the SEC's EDGAR Database [link provided below Table 1]) Using Table 2 above as a reference, the number of outstanding shares of common stock as of 4/28/2015, 5/27/2015, and 6/26/2015 is projected to be 358.8, 358.9, and 359.0 million, respectively. The monthly common stock dividend for the months of April 2015, May 2015, and June 2015 was $0.0833 per share. When calculated, I am projecting PSEC will have dividend distributions of ($89.7) million for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015. When compared to NII of $87.4 million for the fiscal third quarter of 2015, it would appear PSEC will have a slight overpayment of NII for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015 if this figure remains relatively unchanged when compared to the prior quarter. As such, it would appear PSEC's new monthly dividend distributions rate of $0.0833 per share has been supported by the recent quarterly NII figure. With that being said, this general "margin of safety" remains under close surveillance (not that much leeway). When looking at the results from TEST 1 and TEST 2, I believe the probability of PSEC being able to maintain the company's past monthly dividend distributions rate slightly above $0.11 per share materially decreased due to the severity of the recent material quarterly NII overpayments. However, when considering PSEC's recent monthly dividend distributions rate of $0.0833 per share, the company's NII figure over the past fiscal quarter appears to support the recently reduced payout level. However, with that being said, PSEC's margin of safety regarding NII matching quarterly dividend distributions remains narrow. With that being said, TEST 1 and TEST 2 do not specifically account for PSEC's net ICTI figures (which will be discussed in TEST 3 and TEST 4 below) or any future topics/trends to consider (which will be discussed in PART 2 of the article). TEST 3 and TEST 4 will be performed to gain further clarity on PSEC's near-term dividend sustainability. Now let us analyze and discuss the second main factor PSEC considers when choosing a proper dividend distributions per share rate. Second Main Factor - Intend to Cover the Company's Annual Dividend Payout Level with Net ICTI: To "fully" understand and accurately project a BDC's dividend sustainability, one must understand the subtle differences between a company's NII and net ICTI figures/cumulative balances. NII is a GAAP figure which is based on the accrual method of accounting. Net ICTI is an IRC figure which is generally based on the cash method of accounting (some exceptions but I am keeping it simple for this discussion). I will briefly explain the differences between a company's NII and net ICTI figures. In order for PSEC to come up with a proper ICTI figure, there are specific GAAP to IRC adjustments (reversals) that need to be performed each quarter. Income and expense recognition of certain accounting transactions differ between GAAP and the IRC (book versus tax accounting treatments). A majority of PSEC's book to tax differences (either temporary or permanent in nature) consist of the following: 1) deferred financing fees on loans and deferred offering costs in relation to equity raises; 2) amortization (accretion) of loan/investment premiums (discounts); and 3) timing recognition of interest income on certain loans/investments. There are several additional book to tax adjustments that PSEC periodically recognizes. However, for purposes of this article, further discussion of these additional adjustments is unwarranted. Once PSEC's ICTI is known, one adds all net capital gains to this figure (if a capital loss carryforward does not exist). PSEC had a material capital loss carryforward balance as of 8/31/2014 to offset any net capital gains that might arise in the future. As such, this balance will continue to remain $0 for the foreseeable future even if PSEC realizes a material amount of net capital gains on the company's debt/equity investments. After this calculation, PSEC's net ICTI figure is known. Let us now move on with PSEC's near-term dividend sustainability analysis. To test management's second main factor, I believe it is necessary to first analyze and discuss PSEC's past quarterly net ICTI figures to see if the company's quarterly dividend distributions were covered. This will lead to a better understanding of the overall trends regarding this particular factor and possible future pitfalls that may arise. This includes PSEC using the company's cumulative UTI balance on any quarterly net ICTI overpayments. Table 3 below shows PSEC's net ICTI from the fiscal third quarter of 2015 going back to the company's fiscal first quarter of 2014. Table 3 then compares PSEC's quarterly net ICTI figure to the company's dividend distributions figure showing the quarterly underpayment (overpayment). Table 3 below then shows PSEC's quarterly cumulative undistributed net ICTI (deficit) and cumulative UTI balances for the same timeframes. Side Note: As stated earlier, PSEC's fiscal year-end, based on GAAP methodologies, is June 30th of a given year. However, PSEC's tax year-end, based on IRC methodologies, is August 31st of a given year. As such, there's a two month gap between PSEC's fiscal and tax year-end. Table 3 is providing IRC information based on fiscal year-end timeframes to better compare and contrast cumulative undistributed NII (discussed above) and cumulative UTI (discussed below). (Source: Table created entirely by myself, partially using PSEC data obtained from the SEC's EDGAR Database [link provided below Table 1]) Table 3 will be the main source of information as TEST 3 and TEST 4 are analyzed below. Now let us begin the next phase of PSEC's near-term dividend sustainability analysis. TEST 3 - Quarterly Net ICTI Versus Quarterly Distributions Analysis: - See Red References "K, D, L, (D / K)" in Table 3 Above Next to the March 31, 2015 Column Using Table 3 above as a reference, I take PSEC's quarterly "net ICTI" figure (see red reference "K") and subtract this amount by the quarterly "distributions from net ICTI" figure (see red reference "D"). If PSEC's red reference "K" is greater than the company's red reference "D", then PSEC technically had enough quarterly net ICTI to pay out the company's dividend distributions for a particular quarter. Any excess net ICTI left over, after accounting for the dividend distributions, would be added to PSEC's cumulative UTI balance. This particular balance will be further discussed within TEST 4 later in the article. If PSEC's red reference "K" is less than the company's red reference "D", then the company technically did not have enough quarterly net ICTI to pay out its dividend distributions for a particular quarter and must use a portion of the remaining cumulative UTI balance to help with the overpayment. Still using Table 3 above as a reference, PSEC had net ICTI of $151.3, $107.8, and $93.7 million for the fiscal first, second, and third quarters of 2015, respectively. In comparison, PSEC had dividend distributions of ($114.3), ($118.2), and ($99.4) million for the fiscal first, second, and third quarters of 2015, respectively. When calculated, PSEC had an underpayment (overpayment) of net ICTI of $37.0, ($10.4), and ($5.7) million for the fiscal first, second, and third quarters of 2015, respectively (see red reference "(K - D) = L"). This calculates to a dividend distributions payout ratio of 76%, 110%, and 106% for the fiscal first, second, and third quarters of 2015, respectively (see red reference "(D / K)"). PSEC had a combined underpayment of net ICTI of $20.9 million for the fiscal first, second, and third quarters of 2015. However, this material underpayment is a bit deceiving. PSEC's original net ICTI figure in the fiscal first, second, and third quarters of 2015 were amended by the company via several prior period adjustments. Since the two material prior period "true-down" adjustments were discussed/reconciled in a prior article, including the fact this quarter's prior period adjustment was only "minor" in nature ($0.6 million "true-up" adjustment), PSEC's prior period adjustments will not be discussed/reconciled within this particular article. When looking at the dividend distributions payout ratio from the fiscal second quarter of 2014 to the fiscal third quarter of 2015, one can see PSEC materially overpaid the company's dividends during four out of the last six fiscal quarters. In my opinion, considering TEST 3 on a "standalone basis", this evidence helps support PSEC's recent monthly dividend per share rate reduction which began in February 2015. However, it should also be noted PSEC's dividend distributions payout ratio decreased from 110% during the fiscal second quarter of 2015 to 106% during the fiscal third quarter of 2015. This reduced payout ratio was directly attributable to the new monthly dividend rate of $0.0833 per share (new quarterly dividend rate totaling $0.25 per share). Now let us take this analysis a step further and perform TEST 4. TEST 4 - Cumulative UTI Coverage of Quarterly Dividend Distributions Ratio Analysis: - See Red References "D, N, (N / D)" in Table 3 Above Next to the March 31, 2015 Column Once again using Table 3 above as a reference, I take PSEC's "cumulative undistributed UTI" figure (see red reference "N") and divide this amount by the quarterly "distributions from net ICTI" figure (see red reference "D"). From this calculation, PSEC's "cumulative UTI coverage of quarterly dividend distributions ratio" is obtained (see red reference "(N / D)"). The higher this ratio is, the more positive the results regarding PSEC's near-term dividend sustainability. Basically, this ratio shows the amount of cumulative UTI covering the current quarter's dividend distributions (after taking the current month's dividend distributions accrual into account). Continuing to use Table 3 above as a reference, PSEC had a cumulative UTI balance of $70.5, $39.2, and $34.1 million at the end of the fiscal first, second, and third quarters of 2015, respectively. Again, Table 3 is providing IRC information based on fiscal year-end timeframes to better compare and contrast cumulative undistributed NII (discussed in TEST 2 above) and cumulative UTI. One should note these cumulative UTI balances are materially higher (by approximately $45 - $55 million) when compared to PSEC's cumulative undistributed NII (deficit) balance for the same timeframes. As such, this is why I believe net ICTI figures should also be analyzed in any BDC's dividend sustainability analysis. Due to PSEC's recent material dividend reduction, these IRC metrics now provide direct evidence for any potential "special dividends" periodically being declared. The following quote per PSEC's earnings press release for the fiscal third quarter of 2015 (quarter ending 3/31/2015) confirms the company's cumulative UTI balance as of 3/31/2015 matches the cumulative UTI balance calculated in Table 3: "…We have generated cumulative taxable income in excess of cumulative dividends to shareholders since Prospect's initial public offering ("IPO") in 2004. From that IPO through March 2015, our taxable income is $34.1 million in excess of dividends to shareholders…" Having an inverse correlation to the quarterly underpayments (overpayments) of net ICTI shown in TEST 3, PSEC had a cumulative UTI coverage of quarterly dividend distributions ratio of 0.62, 0.33, and 0.34 as of 9/30/2014, 12/31/2014, and 3/31/2015, respectively. Again, the 0.62 ratio as of 9/30/2014 is somewhat deceiving due to the prior period adjustment that occurred during the fiscal second quarter of 2015. Regardless, this ratio remained relatively unchanged during the fiscal third quarter of 2015. When looking at the cumulative UTI balance from the fiscal first quarter of 2014 to the fiscal third quarter of 2015, one can see how this balance has materially decreased. PSEC had a cumulative UTI balance of $102.7 million at the end of the fiscal first quarter of 2014. As stated earlier, as of 3/31/2015 PSEC's cumulative UTI balance was only $34.1 million. When calculated, this balance decreased ($68.6) million over the past six fiscal quarters. When calculated, PSEC had a cumulative UTI coverage of quarterly dividend distributions ratio of 1.19 as of 9/30/2013. As stated earlier, PSEC had a cumulative UTI coverage of quarterly dividend distributions ratio of 0.34 as of 3/31/2015. When calculated, this ratio decreased (0.85) over the past six fiscal quarters. As of 3/31/2015, this was the lowest cumulative UTI coverage of quarterly dividend distributions ratios I have calculated since I have covered PSEC. In my opinion, considering TEST 4 on a "standalone basis", this evidence helps support PSEC's recent monthly dividend per share rate reduction which began in February 2015. However, TEST 4's results somewhat differed from TEST 2's results regarding the fiscal third quarter of 2015. While TEST 2's results continued to show a modest decrease in PSEC's cumulative undistributed NII, TEST 4's results showed a relatively unchanged cumulative UTI when compared to the prior quarter. Furthermore, since PSEC's quarterly net ICTI "break-even" began to materially decrease beginning in February 2015 (due to the recent dividend cut), it is only prudent to now analyze if PSEC's past net ICTI could have covered the company's newly reduced dividend distributions payout level. As stated within TEST 2 earlier, I am projecting PSEC will have dividend distributions of ($89.7) million for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015. When compared to net ICTI of $93.7 million for the fiscal third quarter of 2015 (disregards any prior period adjustments), it would appear PSEC will have a minor underpayment of net ICTI for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015 if this figure remains relatively unchanged when compared to the prior quarter. As such, it would appear PSEC's new monthly dividend distributions rate of $0.0833 per share over the past fiscal quarter appears to support the recently reduced payout level. When looking at the results from TEST 3 and TEST 4, I believe the probability of PSEC being able to maintain the company's recent monthly dividend distributions rate of $0.0833 per share has remained relatively unchanged when compared to the prior quarter. Due to the recently reduced payout level, including the fact PSEC had an additional "cushion" per se with the company's cumulative UTI balance of $34.1 million as of 3/31/2015, I believe the probability of the company declaring a minor, future periodic special dividend towards the end of the year is still a valid consideration. Of course, PSEC's cumulative UTI balance and cumulative UTI coverage of quarterly dividend distributions ratio should be monitored going forward. To sum up the information in PART 1 of this article, four dividend sustainability tests were performed on PSEC. The first two tests were based on PSEC's NII figures which are based on GAAP methodologies. Then next two tests were based on PSEC's net ICTI figures which are based on IRC methodologies. TEST 1 provided the following information in regards to PSEC's NII for the fiscal first, second, and third quarters of 2015, respectively: PSEC's Quarterly NII Payout Ratio: 121%, 129%, and 114% TEST 2 provided the following information in regards to PSEC's cumulative undistributed NII (deficit) balance and cumulative undistributed NII coverage of quarterly dividend distributions ratio as of 9/30/2014, 12/31/2014, and 3/31/2015, respectively: PSEC's Cumulative Undistributed NII (Deficit) Balance: $18.0, ($8.9), and ($20.9) Million PSEC's Cumulative Undistributed NII Coverage of Quarterly Dividend Distributions Ratio: 0.16, (0.08), and (0.21) When looking at the results from TEST 1 and TEST 2 (based on GAAP methodologies), PART 1 has concluded the probability of PSEC being able to maintain the company's past monthly dividend distributions rate slightly above $0.11 per share materially decreased due to the severity of the recent material quarterly NII overpayments. However, when considering PSEC's recent monthly dividend distributions rate of $0.0833 per share, the company's NII figure over the past fiscal quarter appears to support the recently reduced payout level. However, with that being said, PSEC's margin of safety regarding NII matching quarterly dividend distributions remains narrow. Next, TEST 3 provided the following information in regards to PSEC's net ICTI for the fiscal first, second, and third quarters of 2015, respectively: PSEC's Quarterly Net ICTI Payout Ratio: 76%, 110%, and 106% However, as was discussed above, during the fiscal second quarter of 2015 PSEC disclosed a material prior period adjustment which lowered the company's net ICTI during the fiscal first quarter of 2015. As such, PSEC's quarterly payout ratio of 76% for the fiscal first quarter of 2015 is a bit deceiving. When incorporating PSEC's prior period adjustment recorded in the fiscal second quarter of 2015 (in regards to activity during the fiscal first quarter of 2015), the company's quarterly net ICTI payout ratio would increase to 88%. Finally, TEST 4 provided the following information in regards to PSEC's cumulative UTI balance and cumulative UTI coverage of quarterly dividend distributions ratio as of 9/30/2014, 12/31/2014, and 3/31/2015, respectively: PSEC's Cumulative UTI Balance: $70.5, $39.2, and $34.1 Million PSEC's Cumulative UTI Coverage of Quarterly Dividend Distributions Ratio: 0.62, 0.33, and 0.34 When looking at the results from TEST 3 and TEST 4 (based on IRC methodologies), PART 1 has concluded the probability of PSEC being able to maintain the company's recent monthly dividend distributions rate of $0.0833 per share has remained relatively unchanged when compared to the prior quarter. Due to the recently reduced payout level, including the fact PSEC had an additional "cushion" per se with the company's cumulative UTI balance of $34.1 million as of 3/31/2015, I believe the probability of the company declaring a minor, future periodic special dividend towards the end of the year is still a valid consideration. Of course, PSEC's cumulative UTI balance and cumulative UTI coverage of quarterly dividend distributions ratio should be monitored going forward. Final Note: TEST 1, TEST 2, TEST 3, and TEST 4 do not "completely" consider certain future events that could occur over the next several fiscal years. Such events could have a direct impact on PSEC's future dividend sustainability. As such, I believe it is only prudent to include additional analysis regarding PSEC's future dividend sustainability. As such, PART 1 of this article is only a PARTIAL analysis. A "full" conclusion regarding PSEC's future dividend sustainability will not be provided yet. PART 2 of this article will just pick up where PART 1's analysis ends. Since PART 1 of this article mainly covered PSEC's past and current performance, PART 2 will transition to a more "forward-looking" dividend sustainability analysis and will discuss some additional topics/trends to consider in a general net rising interest rate environment that may counter (or confirm) the evidence obtained within PART 1. PART 2 will also perform an analysis on PSEC's future NAV sustainability. At the end of PART 2 of this article, I will include the following PSEC projections: 1) next set of dividend declarations (dividend per share rate for September 2015, October 2015, and November 2015); and 2) NAV per share range for the next several fiscal quarters.
