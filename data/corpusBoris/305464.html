Economists React to Fourth-Quarter U.S. Growth: ‘Consumer Spending and Housing Remain Solid’ - Real Time Economics - WSJ “Big drags” on U.S. growth in the fourth quarter included the “ongoing downturn in energy development and production,” saidÂ Gus Faucher of PNC. The U.S. economy grew a weak 0.7% in the final quarter of 2015, a sign of flagging momentum amid global weakness and financial market turmoil. Here’s what economists had to say: “Growth slowed in the fourth quarter, with big drags from inventories, trade, and the ongoing downturn in energy development and production. But consumer spending and housing remain solid, thanks to good fundamentals including steady job gains, rising wages and low interest rates, and will continue to lead overall economic growth.”â€”Gus Faucher, PNC “A weak quarter, with activity again significantly suppressed by a reduced rate of inventory accumulation….[The personal-consumption expenditure price index] year over year gains remained well below the Fedâ€™s 2% ‘target’ in the latest quarter. Reported inflation continues to be suppressed by lower costs for energy and other commodities and generally reduced import prices owing to dollar strength. So, while Fed forecasts remain for higher inflation, the trajectory of these forecasts keeps getting pushed forward by reality.” â€”Joshua Shapiro, MFR “Fourth-quarter GDP data suggest that the dynamics in this admittedly large corner of the economy just arenâ€™t big enough to deliver the lift that underpins the [Federal Open Market Committee] outlook and, by extension, its December trajectory for policy rates. To weakness in energy, exports, and too much inventory we can now add to the softer side of GDP data the auto sectorâ€”motor vehicle output took 58 basis points away from overall growth. And the economy hasnâ€™t even reached the point, time-wise, where recent equity market weakness would negatively impact spendingâ€”of the consumer or capital kind.” â€”Steve Blitz, ITG Investment Research “The slowdown from [the third quarter to the fourth quarter] primarily reflected a deceleration in [the PCE price index] and downturns in nonresidential fixed investment, in exports, and in state and local government spending….The sluggish headline GDP reading masks the fact that consumer spending held up better than expected in the fourth quarter.” â€”Dana Saporta, Credit Suisse “Just about every cylinder in the engine stalled during the final quarter of 2015… One of the largest drags on the economy was consumer spending which accounts for about 70% of gross domestic product. They had every reason to spend including healthy employment gains, cheaper gasoline and lower import prices. Instead, consumers remained cautious about spending, boosting the savings rate instead. The unseasonably warm weather contributed to the softness, especially for apparel and utilities… The Federal Reserve should be worried by the report. The monetary authorities would want to make sure that economic growth is on a healthy upward trend before raising the interest rate again in 2016.” –Sung Won Sohn, Smith School, California State University “The key theme in these numbers is the stark contrast between the fortunes of the household and business sectors. Households continue to perform well… in stark contrast, business spending was dismal… Consumer spending should reaccelerate in the current quarter as the weather normalizes, business investment, while not robust, is unlikely to be as weak as it was in 4Q, and the drag from inventories should continue to wane.” –Stephen Stanley, Amherst Pierpont “The modest upside surprise relative to our forecast was driven primarily by consumption and residential investment, which we take as a positive signal for the strength of US households and the broader business cycle… Within consumption, robust growth in durable goods purchases bolsters our confidence that the US consumer sector remains solid. Furthermore, residential investment growth surprised to the upside at 8.1%, well above our forecast. Together, better-than-expected growth in big-ticket purchases should allay concerns of a retrenchment in US consumer spending. We expect growth will bounce back to 2.5% in the first quarter, driven by better domestic demand and less of a drag from inventory growth and net trade.” –Jesse Hurwitz, Barclays “Todayâ€™s GDP reading of 0.7% gain was no big surprise as low energy prices, a stronger U.S. dollar and slower global growth took a toll on economic activity. Consumers during the all-important holiday season cut their spending from what it was even mid-2015, evident in the sales results retailers posted. While this is speed bump and a lower ‘stepping-off point’ as we head into the new year, consumer sentiment remains intact. When released, structures, trade and inventories could show further weaker economic activity from the 4th quarter. This could have a lingering effect for the first quarter of 2016.” –Jack Kleinhenz, National Retail Federation We welcome thoughtful comments from readers. Please comply with our guidelines .

Most of these dolts quoted here are still stuck in their belief systems that posits Keynesian stimulation always works. Keynesian stimulation works when debt levels are low or modest, below 50%-60%. It does not work when public and private debt levels around the world are where they are now. These same dolts still despise Reinhart and Rogoff.  But with each passing quarter, R&R are being proven much closer to reality than the Keynesian dolts, led off the cliff by Dolt-in-Chief Paul Krugman. GOP is praying for higher gasoline prices so they can continue their narrative of gloom and doom.  They are also praying for the economy to tank like it did under Bush so they can blame Obama.  Keep praying and maybe something really bad will happen. Real Time Economics offers exclusive news, analysis and commentary on the U.S. and global economy, central bank policy and economics.
