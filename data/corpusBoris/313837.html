Submitted by Robert Gore via StraightLineLogic.com, In a recent article, “ How to Defeat Your Enemies ,” we maintained that governments and their people were natural enemies, and that the most powerful adversarial tactic is “getting one’s enemies to fool themselves.” The article detailed the effective use of this tactic by Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda. The question arises: how can the American people use it against their natural adversary, the US government? Lies are always misrepresentations of reality, and reality always wins. The US government rests on an inherently unstable foundation of whoppers—big lies so huge they would make big lie proponent Adolf Hitler blush—some of which were detailed in the earlier article. The first trick to defeating an enemy is to ascertain its biggest weaknesses and the lies, which it feeds itself, flowing from those weaknesses. Every government craves as much of its country’s resources as it can borrow, swindle, and steal. Our government’s finances are a series of lies. The first is that most people who pay taxes do so voluntarily. That’s a testable proposition. Make tax payments truly optional and voluntary, with no penalty and no civil or criminal liability for nonpayment. How much taxes do you think the government would collect? The taxes collected as a percentage of the taxes formerly collected would be an exact measure of the “voluntariness” of the tax system. Closely linked to voluntary tax compliance is people’s willingness to back the government’s and the central bank’s debt. Creditors loan the US government money because the government has first call on the income and wealth generated by the world’s most productive economy. Besides the provision of a legal framework (currently a tiny part of its budget) the government has little to do with actual production, and often impedes it. Producers produce, and the decision to produce more than what’s necessary for subsistence is voluntary. Conduct a test similar to the tax test: ask producers to voluntarily send in money to pay the government’s debt bill, and see how much it receives. It would be even less than what it received in voluntarily paid taxes. The government’s revenues are coerced exactions. A portion of those revenues are then redistributed from highly productive, low-vote groups to less or non-productive, high-vote groups, and that process is riddled with prevarication. Social security and Medicare employ the fiction that the taxes they extract are like contributions to a pension or medical insurance plan that is invested and builds value over the years. In fact, those “contributions” are paid out as they come in; there are no trust funds building equity for their “contributors.” The trust fund nomenclature is the mark of a swindle. The lies associated with the government’s newest foray into medicine, Obamacare, are numerous and well-documented. Similar lies can be untangled from virtually all the government’s redistribution schemes and social spending, but only by the stout of heart and strong of stomach. The US government’s—virtually all governments’—biggest weakness is that it produces nothing on its own and must either borrow, swindle, or steal what it spends from those who do produce. Government is thus dependent on the voluntary choice of producers to produce and creditors to lend. Economic collapse and bankruptcy have felled far more governments than revolutions or invasions, although revolutionaries or invaders often administer the coup de grÃ¢ce. Yet, those who consider themselves modern American revolutionaries often envision manning barricades and mass revolt as the undoing of the government.That attacks the government at its greatest strength—its capacity to use force and violence. The US government has at its disposal the most potent military and surveillance capabilities ever assembled. Most of its warriors (the military, and federal and local police forces) are brainwashed and would open fire on, imprison, or kill anyone they are told is a threat to the state. If it so chose, the government could destroy some or all of this country with nuclear weapons, and it cannot be ruled out that we may someday have psychopathic “leaders” who would do just that if they felt sufficiently threatened, or maybe just for fun. The idea that some sort of mass movement will rise and by force of its inferior arms throw off the yoke of oppression is the stuff of weak novels, not a real life strategy that has a chance of success. Those who buy into it and attempt implementation commit the biggest strategic failure: they have fooled themselves. Consequently, their enemy—the government—profits. It uses their failure to justify further tyranny and repression. There is surprisingly little written about attacking the government at its weakest point: its financial dependence (see, however, “ Revolution in America ,”). An offensive would require a mass movement far less massive than that required for armed revolt, and its tactics would be legal. A few million simultaneous phone calls and requests via websites for the withdrawal of balances from banks, money market funds, and stock and bond mutual funds would precipitate a financial panic. None of those institutions keep enough cash on hand to meet a tsunami of redemption and withdrawal requests. They’d have to sell their assets to raise cash. The prices of those assets would drop, begetting further selling; negative crowd psychology and wealth effects would kick in as markets crash, and debt and economic activity would contract. The biggest loser in all this would be the government. As prices for bonds drop, interest rates rise, increasing its debt service. As economic activity contracts, tax receipts drop, safety net spending rise, crony capitalists must be bailed out, and deficits expand. Except for interest on government debt rising (it was perceived as a safe haven) all of this happened during the last financial crises. A massive increase in government debt and central bank debt monetization forestalled complete disaster last time. Even some of their proponents admit that those palliatives are now exhausted. During the next crisis, interest rates will rise on government debt to reflect its increasing credit risk. Which will leave the government confronting, and being defeated by, one of its biggest whoppers: that the pieces of paper and computer notations its Treasury and central bank generate ultimately have value after decades of determined efforts to depreciate them. They’re simply pieces of paper and computer entries, and eventually they’re not going to buy any groceries for all those warriors and police the government’s counting on, or for anyone else. Currencies collapse just before governments do; witness Venezuela, with its Bolivar and its government in extremis. This outcome does not require a plan; it’s going to happen. Indeed, it’s already happening. Anyone who wants to hasten the process in their own small way can stop lending governments money in the Treasury and municipal bond markets. Politically, they should vote for the politician who will promote more foreign military intervention, domestic spending, taxation, redistribution from the productive to the nonproductive, and economically destructive regulation. A vote for any of the candidates still standing will serve that purpose. As the government crumbles and chaos stages an upside breakout, other tactics to opportunistically capitalize on system failure and reinstate liberty will be feasible.

Tell all the gov employees and military personnel you know.  If it was promised to you, you were lied to.  Simple as that.  There just is no way for the government to fulfill all those promises.  MAYBE you can get 20cents on the dollar for everything they have promised you. Stop all payments to financial institutions and the government. Mon, 02/08/2016 - 21:46 | 7159208 y3maxx Mon, 02/08/2016 - 22:02 | 7159281 jughead Americans have turned into wussies...don't believe me?  Go ahead, lead a tax revolt and let me know how it works out.  Been there, done that, I didn't spark a revolution...people are too comfortable to stick their necks out for the government to chop off.  Nope they best way to strip this system back down to bare bones is to let the dipsticks do exactly what they want...they're already driving us over a cliff...all we gotta do is put on our chutes and help em press the accellerator. zoom zoom Mon, 02/08/2016 - 22:11 | 7159326 True Blue Mon, 02/08/2016 - 22:32 | 7159407 AldousHuxley Elites are so out of touch that only way to reset the system is to bring war on their soil. But that will lower standard of living for all since elites exploit rest of the society to fight the wars. Best for anyone is to move out of the country. If you are truely world's best skilled contributor then you have no worries. All of those who are depend on government will have a rude awakening. Mon, 02/08/2016 - 22:40 | 7159433 Stuck on Zero You guys are thinking too dramatically. Everyone go out and buy gold and the fiat power system will topple instantly. Tue, 02/09/2016 - 01:14 | 7159785 runningman18 The idea that you can defeat a tyrannical government through economic non-participation alone is complete nonsense.  It's part of the solution, and very useful, but not a silver bullet.  I'm betting the author is a pacifist of some kind because he overlooks the fact that many times you have to do some fighting, some dying, and some bad guys need to swing from lamp posts before the despots are defeated.  It's unavoidable.  Germany fell into greater tyranny after the Weimar collapse; government power did not just fade away, it was replaced with something worse.  The founding fathers used non-participation against the British and they still had to fight.  Economic disasters are only an opportunity for the banking elites unless you remove them by force.  Anyone who claims otherwise is not familiar with history and is probably delusional. Tue, 02/09/2016 - 04:52 | 7159977 jeff montanye but it is part of the solution, as is the election of outsiders/rebels/libertarians/socialists (people outside the neo-con/neo-liberal establishment).  and it is legal.   however one must acknowledge that, for some, selective assassination has its attractions as well.  senior people who worked in both the bush and obama administrations would seem particularly vulnerable. Mon, 02/08/2016 - 22:30 | 7159391 Down to Earth T... Agree this current out of control government is already killing itself. The masses have NOT suffered enough to actually do anything about anything ? But they will suffer and then we shall see how the tables turn ? All the pieces of the puzzle are in place for massive chaos on many fronts here in USSA today. An outlier event will tip it all over and the various forms of pain will ensue on the masses. Most of it will simply be their own weaknesses,  but it will tweek many millions here in the land of fools. This article does not consider the lack of consequences so far, or as I call it the coming suffering. The many illusions have worked very well, but they are in fact breakng down very rapidly, world wide. Obama care will be a complete fail and that will be a sort of push start and reality check to how badly people have been fucked in the last 10 years. It will lead to ever greater turmoil very rapidly going forward. This entire system will fall under its own weight. It is already in motion.

The assumption is that it has not worked and the structures protect the government, now to the extent that it is impenetrable. if anybody really wants to know they can go to the former East Germany and find out which needlepricks worked then.  But one thing has been forgotten. The animosity against the government also comes from not having enough funds for the community as they spend it all on bombs and the military industrial complex. If people were to demand that those who benefit from the regime change in Syria fund the war through War Bonds instead of making the general taxpayer pay, people would be less hostile against the government.  I mean like Carter gone and Reagan in? Or possibly you good was done by Bush out and Tinkerbell in? Incremental change is what democracy does.  It doesn't burn the house down and pick up the pieces. It is built precisely to not do that. Mon, 02/08/2016 - 21:33 | 7159142 FIAT CON Think of it as a worn out pair of shoes, try to repair the soles and every other part of the shoe or just dicard them and work for a new pair. Mon, 02/08/2016 - 21:39 | 7159162 jm Ok, so name a corner of the world in better shape.  In other words, I'm intrigued but don't think the country is hopelesssly imploding. Mon, 02/08/2016 - 22:35 | 7159418 Uchtdorf jm, where, pray tell, are you finding the optimism to believe that things are going to work out? The center will not hold. It's not intended to hold. The incrementalism you speak of has been used in exactly the opposite direction of what you hope for. The elites are planning to kill you, and me, because we don't fit into their global plans. Mon, 02/08/2016 - 22:59 | 7159485 jm Honestly, I had cancer twice.  The docs will never say I am cancer free again.  Better a live dog than a dead lion. I wouldn't recommend it, but it keeps you grateful and centered. Mon, 02/08/2016 - 21:40 | 7159177 FIAT CON There is no way that a few great newly elected people can fix this, it has gone way too far for that.  Mon, 02/08/2016 - 21:51 | 7159230 jm I have no illusions about Ted Cruz or anybody.  But there are institutional improvements possible, prolly not common. Like a balanced budget bill.  It happened in a lot of states, and try as they might, the voters won't let it go because it is a reasonable restraint on public purpose screwing private interest. What if a law was passed that said if you opt for public assistance, you cannot vote? The vice of you voting yourself a pay increase every election is eliminated. You may not agree, just using this as an example. Mon, 02/08/2016 - 22:11 | 7159331 FIAT CON Ok, just for arguments sake. You fix the problem with new elected officials, now how do you deal with the $200 T of unfunded liabilities. Do you plan on a 75% income tax bracket for several years to come to pay off the debt your elected leaders have created in your name.  Dont forget about the JFK syndrome. The worlds owners will not like this a bit. They are used to their cut and will kill to maintain it. Mon, 02/08/2016 - 22:37 | 7159424 jm No, you rely on established wind-up procedure provided by the court of law to deal with such situations. Recall thet BK laws are the product of the natural selection of ideas over centuries. Tue, 02/09/2016 - 01:07 | 7159782 FIAT CON Where do you think you can start, almost every politician is owned by their corproate masters, and all the police agencies work for them. It has gone too far. Mon, 02/08/2016 - 22:17 | 7159347 Pazuzu Reagan doubled the national debt and tripled the number of federal employees. He is the one who took defense spending from 'Just how much do you need?" to "Here, just take a fixed percentage of the budget and try to dream up ways to spend any extra". Bush 41 tried to kill him and he never figured it out. Like Clinton's terms of prosperity, Reagan's were almost entirely due to market cycles and the work of his predecessors, the much maligned Carter among them. Mon, 02/08/2016 - 22:41 | 7159435 jm Ok, so you don't like Reagan.  Pick the other side as the improvement.  Just because I call him tinkerbell doesnt mean you can't appreciate Obama's lack of accomplishments. Not arguing with your point about business cycles.  But his binge did bankrupt the USSR and cause its fall, which was a wonderful thing worth noting. There were no American tanks in the Red Square when communism fell. Mon, 02/08/2016 - 22:17 | 7159356 lincolnsteffens When Democracy ignores the Republic, the Republic is destroyed and mob rule reigns. It maters not if it is the street mob or the government mob. They both destroy without concern for those whom they destroy. Tue, 02/09/2016 - 03:49 | 7159939 Ace006 Reagan was fought every step of the way and was sui generis for his insight and persistence. The Dems have fielded clowns and the GOPe is determined to frustrate any public choice. Trump too is sui generis. Anything appearing to be "democracy" in the last 35 years is a fluke. Even Reagan didn't stem the immigrant flow. Hoping for slight improvements through voting is a bit of a pipe dream. Mon, 02/08/2016 - 21:25 | 7159113 herkomilchen That's like saying, can't we make our slavemaster nicer?  Well, maybe.  But no matter how nice we make him, at the end of the day, we'd still be slaves.  Bit of a problem, that. Mon, 02/08/2016 - 21:29 | 7159122 jm Men aren't angels. Without some way to coordinate and restrain by consent, the end result is the law of the jackal. This reduces men to beasts. Mon, 02/08/2016 - 21:36 | 7159154 illyia Maybe the whole title - even the premise - is wrong. Maybe the title should be "How to defeat mendacious oppressive propagandistic sneaky rotten scoundrels!!! Mon, 02/08/2016 - 21:53 | 7159242 jm I'm not sure you can get rid of them all.  It is the "cost of doing business" an unavoidable part of civilized life that can only be minimized to soem degree. Mon, 02/08/2016 - 21:44 | 7159155 herkomilchen You've been brainwashed to think anarchy doesn't work so you'll throw your support behind government ruling you.  Anarchy doesn't require men to be angels, it provides ample means to coordinate and restrain by consent.  Read Murray Rothbard, Stephan Molyneux, and David Friedman to understand. Mon, 02/08/2016 - 21:46 | 7159210 jm It's not brainwashing, just looking around.  I've never seen anarchy work well. Anywhere. Try driving to work under conditions of anarchy.   Instead of paradise, I've seen plenty of people take what they can when they can where restraints are broken or too loose. Mon, 02/08/2016 - 22:22 | 7159268 herkomilchen You've never seen anarchy.  You've seen failed states ruling people dependent on them.  Failed states forcibly thwart individual responsibility and free markets, preventing them from operating normally, but without supplying viable services thus maintaining a vacuum in which restraints are broken or too loose. You can insist that you must be subjugated, and other men must violently rule you if you like.  I think you are a free and sovereign person who should be violently ruled by no one and are competent to organize your own affairs. I think your desire to live by rules and be safe from aggressors is shared by the vast majority of others, and in voluntary cooperation with them you can have all the services government currently monopolizes yet with far higher quality and lower cost while still retaining your fundamental freedom. I hope you read up on the nitty gritty of why and how free markets in the realm of governance actually works.  I think you'll experience many a-ha moments. Mon, 02/08/2016 - 22:45 | 7159442 jm So have you ever seen anarchy. Tell me where, I'll go visit. Don't give me a book reference, because you will have made my point and I will throw up from your banality. Not "subjugated", but rather consent to restraints on my behavior. It is in my interest to obey the traffic lights... I save my life and other as well. Mon, 02/08/2016 - 23:20 | 7159538 2muchtax Do you also obey traffic signs on private property, like shopping centers, and private HOAs, or do you imediately go Mad Max when driving on private property? Is it possible that you just choose to be safe and curtious like the other 99% of us? People who are bad drivers in public pay a small fine and get to go back out and wreak havoc. People who cause problems on private property get banned. Which do you think is more effective. Tue, 02/09/2016 - 01:01 | 7159775 rapetrain Haha Mad Max that's hilarious. The people we have to fear and worry about are the ones who fear anarchy â€” they are projecting their own unacceptable feelings and proclivities onto others. it's a psychological phenomenon called projection. And bad example on traffic lights/signs - when they remove stop signs in rural areas fatal traffic accidents drop dramatically - because people watch what is actually going on around them when no signs are present, rather than foolishly trusting all will obey.  Duh. Mon, 02/08/2016 - 23:08 | 7159503 2muchtax Agreed. The private market already fills in a lot of gov't gaps. Bounty hunters are much more effective at finding fugitives than police. Gated communities are much safer than the surrounding communitites and provide better recreational services. Shopping centers and private industrial parks build fantastic roads. A civil court/tribunal system could exist without a government. Fedex is much better than the post office. I could go on for hours; unfortunately there is some flaw in the human DNA that makes us desire to be ruled by narcissistic assholes. Tue, 02/09/2016 - 03:58 | 7159945 Ace006 Let us call those guys libertopians. They think it will be handshakes all around when they get their anarchy but that anarchy will invariably be like Baltimore or Ferguson.  Mon, 02/08/2016 - 22:13 | 7159335 jughead Once you get too many miles on an engine you can't keep it going just by fixing things when they break...at some point you gotta either tear the engine down and rebuild it, or replace it.  This engine has too many miles on it...it doesn't run for crap anymore and is all sludged up with shit.  We all know that it needs a rebuild, but the dipsticks doing the driving just keep on driving it harder and faster.  All we gotta do is let em keep on going harder and faster...they WILL blow the engine, giving them no choice but to have it rebuilt or replaced.  Our (the good guys/gals) job is to make sure we're the only shop left in business who can do the job.  Mon, 02/08/2016 - 22:47 | 7159453 jm One should always be careful to not chose the devil you do not know to replace the one you know.
