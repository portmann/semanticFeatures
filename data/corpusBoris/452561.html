Americans spent part of their savings from cheaper gasoline on more food and fuel, a new study says. Photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images That’s at least part of a fairly nuanced picture the J.P. Morgan Institute found after analyzing (anonymized) transaction records from 1 million of the bank’s credit and debit cards. When crude oil prices plunged in 2014, many economists and analysts expected households would splurge, offering a boost to consumer spending numbers and helping support the economy. Instead, the results were mixed and evidence of a cheap-oil dividend often elusive . Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen last month estimated the sharp fall in gasoline prices worked out to an average $780 in savings per household Â last year and another $420 through May of this year. “Households had the potential to save $630 at the pump, of which they spent the majorityâ€”58%. This spending provided more than a $200 boost to spending on non-gas goods and services, primarily restaurants and retailers. The lower gas prices also caused significant changes in household transportation choices, leading people to spend $150 more at gas stations and spend less on transit.” Middle-income householdsâ€”in the $43,100 to $56,500 per year rangeâ€”saw a $477 drop in gas spending from 2014 to 2015. That’s equal to about 1% of income or more than half of one monthâ€™s housing costs for a typical family, according to the report. Savings were biggest in the Midwest and South and the lowest on the West coast and urban areas in the Northeast. So whyÂ didn’t the economy get a bigger boost? The aggregate shifts in spending get lost in part because gasoline is a relatively small share of overall consumer outlaysâ€”gasoline and other motor fuel made up about 1.8% of all personal consumption expenditures on goods and services during the first quarter of this year, down from about 3.2% in the first half of 2014, according to Commerce Department data. But by digging deep into spending patterns, the J.P. Morgan study finds noticeable shifts in spending patterns, including a significant reversal of trends toward driving less and taking public transport more. The institute speculates households also spent on new cars and other big-ticket items that don’t show up on credit-card bills. “That is a particularly interesting finding and is consistent with people being willing to buy new cars, less fuel efficient cars and heavier cars that use more gas,” said Diana Farrell, president and CEO of the J.P. Morgan Chase Institute. Of course, a simple supplyÂ curve suggests lower prices lead toÂ greater consumption of a good or service. And the U.S. governmentÂ is forecasting a 12% drop in average gasoline prices from 2015 to 2016. Does that mean households will keep buying more gasoline and pump the restÂ back into the economy? “I don’t know that we can assume that the behavior would be the same just pro-rated to whatever the changes [in gasoline price] are,” Ms. Farrell said. “I think the broader context matters a lot more.” That broader context includes the labor market, wages, the overall economy and other factors that can support or detract from consumer confidence and household spending.
