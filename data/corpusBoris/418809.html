Brazil posts primary surplus in April, beats expectations | Reuters Brazil posts primary surplus in April, beats expectations BRASILIA Brazil's central government on Monday posted a primary budget surplus of 9.751 billion reais ($2.72 billion) in April, well above market expectations for a small surplus. In March, the central government recorded a deficit of 7.9 billion reais, a record shortfall for that month, due to a decline in tax revenues. The central government account, which includes federal ministries, the central bank and social security, had been expected to post a surplus of 600 million reais, according to the median forecast in a Reuters poll of 12 economists. Interim President Michel Temer, who replaced President Dilma Rousseff while she faces an impeachment trial, widened the central government's primary deficit target to 170 billion reais, which is equivalent to 2.75 percent of gross domestic product. The record deficit forecast reflects the dire state of government finances after years of heavy spending and steep tax breaks under the Rousseff administration that cost Brazil its coveted investment-grade credit rating last year. The primary balance of payments, or the difference between revenues and expenditures prior to interest debt payments, is a key gauge of a country's capacity to honor its debt. But some economists warn that the sheer size of the deficit estimate could pave the way for more public spending ahead of mayoral elections in October. In the first of a series of measures to try to plug the budget deficit, new Finance Minister Henrique Meirelles has proposed legislation to cap public spending which includes debt interest payments, that could top 10 percent of GDP for the second straight year. Brazil's economy probably shrank for a fifth straight quarter in early 2016 as the impeachment process against Rousseff paralyzed investments and pushed the country closer to its worst economic downturn on record.
