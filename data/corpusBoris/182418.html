Half Of Americans Think "Government Is An Immediate Threat To Liberty" | Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! Clearly the title to this piece will be viewed as controversial, if not entirely heretical, by many readers. However, the facts (and more importantly) the economic principles here are unequivocal. â€œ... Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site!

But what may be surprising is that almost half of Americans clearly identified government as a clear and “immediate” threat, and are obviously outraged about what is going on. Oddly, the number of angry Americans has remained consistent in poll number ever since about 2006 during George W. Bush’s second term, maintaining around 46-49% throughout Barack Obama’s entire presidency. Almost half of Americans, 49%, say the federal government poses “an immediate threat to the rights and freedoms of ordinary citizens,” similar to what was found in previous surveys conducted over the last five years. The remarkable finding about these attitudes is how much they reflect apparent antipathy toward the party controlling the White House, rather than being a purely fundamental or fixed philosophical attitude about government. […] during the Republican administration of George W. Bush, Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents were consistently more likely than Republicans and Republican-leaning independents to say the federal government posed an immediate threat. Still, the persistent finding in recent years that half of the population views the government as an immediate threat underscores the degree to which the role and power of government remains a key issue of our time… numerous other measures show that the people give their government some of the lowest approval and trust ratings in the measures’ history. So why does the situation between the people and government continue to deteriorate? The complaints about government’s abuse of powers reaches across the isle, and straddles both parties in the White House, yet people tend to direct their anger only at the current president – thus falling for the ruse of blaming the puppet, and not the system. As Americans shift blame about the state of affairs back-and-forth with every election, most miss the point about why these things are happening – someone is writing reports and creating policies that allow these things to happen. All the Congress and President do is approve them, and deflect attention towards who is running the show. What are Americans upset about, according to polls?: Overall, Americans who agree that the government is an immediate threat tend to respond with very general complaints echoing the theme that the federal government is too big and too powerful, and that it has too many laws. They also cite nonspecific allegations that the government violates freedoms and civil liberties, and that there is too much government in people’s private lives. perceptions that the government is “socialist,” that the government spends too much, that it picks winners and losers such as the wealthy or racial and ethnic minorities, that it is too involved in things it shouldn’t be and that it violates the separation of powers. freedom of speech, freedom of religion, the overuse of police and law enforcement, government surveillance of private citizens including emails and phone records, government involvement in gay marriage issues, overregulation of business, overtaxing, the healthcare law and immigration. The vast majority of these issues happen under the mis-leadership of both parties, progressing without fail through the years. It is time that Americans embrace their anger at government, and focus their attention past the politicians to the real problem.

Yes, and I bet about 45% of those same exact American would still turn around and vote for more government handouts and socialist policies if they were given the choice.  Thu, 09/24/2015 - 20:05 | 6591082 NoDebt That leaves the other 51% who have no fucking clue.  Our Constitution was written around the idea of being distrustful of a large, centralized government.

They are just about as reasonable and friendly to any criticism.  They have been convinced all evil things eminate from the private sector and from their only. Do NOT ask to compare and contrast Adolf, Stalin, Pol Pot or even the guys who casually choked Eric Garner to death with anyone who cheated on their taxes or the CEO of VW who faked the emissions testing.  They actually believe if you eliminate 100% of the military that the money will go to free lunches for kindergarteners or they might even get a piece of the savings.  Thu, 09/24/2015 - 20:16 | 6591118 NoDebt You ain't kidding, kaiserhoff.  RIGHT NOW as I type this, they are setting up a perimeter with checkpoints and metal detectors in Philadelphia (once the "Cradle of Liberty" for the founding of our nation) out on the streets for a dozen blocks around where the Pope is going to be this weekend. Imagine that:  you can not walk the public streets of the city right now without being stopped, searched and generally have any right of "liberty" stripped from you. I asked how that could be (legally).  Answer:  RECENT EXECUTIVE POWERS OF THE PRESIDENT to command, at his sole discretion, the suspension of various freedoms, or ALL freedoms, at any time or place of his choosing.  He activated those powers for the Pope's visit to Philadelphia.  The order was then carried out by the Secret Service, directing and coordinating local law enforcement agencies who are now under their control based on the President's order.

What one huge historical event helped hide trillions in lost money at the pentagram, all the SEC files on worldcom, Enron etc, justified the police/surveillance state and all the naked imperialism since? Holy fuck are you naievely trusting and intellectually lazy. Thu, 09/24/2015 - 21:00 | 6591271 justdues So your neighbor decides to build a fence. Problem is it seems to be on your property. He shouldn't have had to ask for permission? Human beings at large (not just the US) tend to be grubbing assholes that will do anything they think they can get away with. Imagine how fucked things would be if nobody had to have permission to do anything they want. Right. Sure. OK. BTW 9/11 wasn't an inside job. Impossible. This from someone that spent time in the military and have been involved with planning a few things... Thu, 09/24/2015 - 19:44 | 6590997 Bring the Gold I guess standard air defense protocols being ignored, amazingly coincidental war games over the mid west and stand down orders just all happened as a giant stroke of coincidental luck helping the MIC, intel agencies and the coverup of massive financial crimes. Makes sense just a whole host of coinky-dinks to justify a massive police state and naked imperialism. Well golly aren't they all just a bunch of lucky duckies.

Nobody who studies the evidence has any question about the reality of 911 as a false flag.  It was, no question at all, scientific solid evidence.

Don't forget "fees", when you have been granted permission you must then pay a fee, it's like a legal payoff for something that in a rational world should be free.

So why does the situation between the people and government continue to deteriorate? TAXES. Duh... Keep raising taxes whilst the roads look like shit and the schools seem to be getting worse and that is the nexus of all government distrust.
