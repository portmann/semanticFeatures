Fed official criticizes fiscal 'drama' in U.S. Congress | Reuters NEW YORK Oct 9 A top Federal Reserve policymaker waded into the political debate over a possible U.S. default or government shutdown, saying on Friday that such fiscal "drama" in Washington hurts confidence in the economy. "To have a lot of drama around our fiscal affairs - that either a government shutdown or, even worse, a default on national debt is even possible - is not good for confidence," Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart told journalists and students in New York. The U.S. Congress faces a deadline to lift the debt limit on Nov. 5 and another potential shutdown threat in December.
