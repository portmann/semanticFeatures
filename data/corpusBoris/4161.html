Why India Has Embarked On A Long-Term Bull Market - Part 8 | Seeking Alpha The recent budget was pragmatic with a long term roadmap for increasing investment and decreasing corporate tax rates. The Central Bank RBI has again cut rates by 25 bps taking advantage of falling inflation. In Part 1 of this series , I had laid out my thesis on why Indian stocks are set for a long term bull market. In seven subsequent parts, I had written in more detail about the factors that are leading to this bull market. In the last part of the series, I had mentioned about investing in the defence manufacturing theme. The Indian government wants to indigenize defence manufacturing and reduce the massive arms imports. This article will again go back into the factors behind the bull market and see the changes being made in the fiscal and monetary policies. The Indian government gave its full year Budget in the last week of February, in which a number of major structural changes were made. The Indian Budget is that time for the country, when major economic reforms are announced giving an overall direction to the economic policy. India also saw a 25 bps cut to its interest rate, which was announced a day after the Budget. India's inflation rate has been falling sharply due to a fall in commodity prices and this has allowed RBI the leeway to cut interest rates. India's industrial growth scenario still remains in a moribund state and this interest rate cut was a good move. Here are some of the major positive factors announced in the Budget: Restarting the Infrastructure Investment Cycle - India suffers from a huge shortage of quality infrastructure. This not only leads to issues in manufacturing but also creates supply side inflation. India's investment in infrastructure has been woefully inadequate due to fund constraints, red tape, land acquisitions and corruption. India also has been pretty bad at large project management, leading to both time and cost overruns. PPP in India has also not worked properly, with many projects like the Delhi airport Metro, Gurgaon-Delhi highways etc. running into litigation creating problems for the end users. Road projects have almost slowed down to a crawl. The new government is focusing on infrastructure, creating a new Rs 20,000 crore (~$3.2 billion) fund for providing equity investments in infrastructure projects. The Indian Railways have also announced an ambitious plan for expansion over the following 5 years. Tax free infrastructure bonds have also been allowed which should also provide additional funds for the infrastructure sector. Reduction in the Corporate tax rate - The finance minister announced a roadmap for reducing the corporate tax rate from 30% to 25% over the next 4 years. This will make the Indian manufacturing more competitive with other companies and also give an impetus to the Prime Minister's "Make in India" policy. This was the most important development in my view. The government also announced that it would make the tax regime more conductive for foreign investment. This should help boost foreign investment which has suffered badly from the retroactive tax actions in the recent past (Vodafone case, Nokia case etc.). RBI Interest Rate cut - The central bank RBI surprised the markets with a 25 bps cut in the interest rate , just a couple of days after the Budget. This led to a strong rally in the Indian stock market led by banks. Many state owned banks are slowing down, due to creation of large NPAs because of distress in the infrastructure sector. The interest rate cut is important for power and infrastructure companies which are groaning under large debt burdens. The last boom had led to exuberant growth fueled by loans from banks. However economic mismanagement has led to poor execution of these projects, leading to rising NPAs in the system. With the government focused on reducing red tape and clearing large infrastructure projects, the infrastructure NPAs should reduce. More Funds transfer to state - The Indian central government has decided to transfer more revenues to the states. This is in line with the 'devolution of powers to states' policy of the current PM Modi. India is more like a continent rather than a country with great diversity in languages, culture and economic development. Putting more funds into the hands of the state governments will allow more effective utilization of funds, as each state can tailor its development programs based on its own assessment. Renewable Energy Focus - India had already announced ambitious targets for renewable energy generation capacity addition. The country has set a target of 100 GW of solar energy alone by 2022. India imported almost $150 billion of crude oil last year and also large amounts of gas and coal. This not only creates pressure on the trade deficit but also impacts energy security. On the other hand, India has abundant sunshine being located near to the equator. India already has the 5th largest wind energy capacity in the world. It plans to further accelerate wind energy capacity from the current 2000-3000 MW through annual additions. The Finance Minister announced that it was increasing the cess on coal from Rs 100/ton to Rs 200/ton. This cess will go into a clean energy fund, which could be used to fund clean energy capacity. Many companies such as First Solar (NASDAQ: FSLR ), SunEdison (NYSE: SUNE ) etc. have announced multi-billion dollar investments in the Indian renewable energy. Not much cut in wasteful subsidies - The prime minister did not make moves to cut wasteful subsidies such as food subsidy, NREGA, kerosene subsidy etc. Note, it is a known fact that all these subsidies see massive leakages and most of the money does not reach the participants. The government did not think it prudent to take on the vested interests this time around. Though petrol and diesel subsidies have been removed, other wasteful subsidies need to be removed too. The move to give banking accounts and identity cards to citizens is good. This will enable transfer of cash subsidies and plugging of the leaks. Fiscal deficit targets deferred by one year - The fiscal deficit target of 3% was postponed by a year , as the government wants to spend more on infrastructure and reviving the investment cycle. Given that India's currency is strong and deficit is coming down, I think it is not a big issue and may be a good idea if the deficit money is used to fund capital investments. The Indian stock market has been almost immune to the turmoil in the global markets because of the tumble in the crude oil prices. Even as emerging markets such as Brazil, Russia, South Africa etc. saw their markets and currencies falling sharply over the oil price fall, India was insulated. The Indian market still trades just 5% shy of its all-time high, as falling commodity prices will strongly benefit the Indian economy. While the pace of the economic reforms may not be fast enough for everyone's liking, the government has shown great intent. The interest rates sensitive sectors such as banks (ICICI Bank (NYSE: IBN ), HDFC Bank (NYSE: HDB ), real estate companies, construction companies and automobile stocks got a big boost due to the interest rate cut. Cement companies also did well due to the focus on infrastructure. Most infrastructure companies such as GMR, Lanco, and JP Associates etc. are still suffering from a high debt burden and there is not much clarity if they can get out of the debt trap. The companies which manage to restructure and raise funds should do well. Suzlon has not only cut down on its debt, but also got a massive equity infusion from a new investor. This should help the stock do well in the long term. The US investors can look to invest in the Indian infrastructure ETF (NYSEARCA: INXX ) to play the infrastructure theme. The Indian government is living up to its promise, though the pace of reforms is not to everyone's liking. The government managed to pass the pending insurance bill and will be pushing hard to pass other reform measures such as land acquisition, coal mining bill etc. in the next couple of weeks. Given the government's minority in the Upper House of parliament, passing legislation has not been fast or easy. The opposition has been delaying legislation work using lame issues. India is the second largest country in the world in terms of population and it is not easy to quickly change the system and processes in a democratic system. The government is on the right track. The recent small correction in the stock markets mainly due to global macro factors may be a good chance to enter the Indian market.
