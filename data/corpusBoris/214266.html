New Oriental: Growth Accelerating, Margins Bottoming - New Oriental Education & Technology Group Inc. (NYSE:EDU) | Seeking Alpha New Oriental reported Q1 2016 EPS and revenue ahead of views and also guided Q2 revenue ahead of the consensus. Softening economy actually having a positive effect on EDUâ€™s business. Margins have likely bottomed and have room for significant improvement in fiscal 2017 and beyond. O2O investments to start paying off soon. New Oriental's (NYSE: EDU ) fiscal Q1 2016 report came in above expectations. The company is executing its "optimize the market" strategy very well and it seems that margins have finally bottomed and may be ready for expansion in fiscal 2017 and beyond. Management remarks on the softening economy and its impact on the business are quite positive and the investments and the changes the company is making are starting to pay off. I am even more bullish on EDU's growth prospects than I was earlier this year and I expect the company to fetch a higher valuation in the following quarters based on margin stabilization and the potential for solid expansion in the following years. The strong balance sheet serves as downside protection and the company might use its ample cash reserves to become more active on the M&A front. EDU's fiscal Q1 2016 revenues and EPS came in above analyst expectations. The growth rates are particularly encouraging given RMB's devaluation in the last few months (EDU reports earnings in US dollars) and the top line growth has actually accelerated in local currency. The fiscal Q2 guidance for revenue growth between 13% and 17% was also above the analyst consensus, which was near the low end of the guidance range at the time, and the actual RMB growth rate for the second fiscal quarter is between 17% and 21%. Strength was broad-based and the most notable improvement was in the revamped POP Kids program, which saw a revenue increase of more than 30% Y/Y compared to single-digit increases in the previous two quarters. K-12 revenue grew 29% Y/Y and U-Can revenue increased 28% Y/Y. What I found very interesting when going over the fiscal Q1 conference call was the fact that management was very positive on the company's growth prospects even in a softening Chinese economy. They actually argued that this might be a net positive for the company: Parents in China save for their children's education regardless of the state of the economy and perhaps even more so when times are bad. A slowing economy gets them in protection mode and they expect their children to face more competition for jobs in the future and this motivates them to increase their spending on education. The slowing economy should lead to less wage inflation, which should positively affect EDU's cost structure. Angel and venture capital investments in online education are also slowing down, which should lead to less competition in the online education space and will likely lead to higher staff retention for EDU. On the negative side, blended ASPs increased just 3% Y/Y, which is the lowest pace in the last couple of years. Non-GAAP operating margin was up 30 basis points over the same quarter last year and TTM non-GAAP net margin has likely bottomed (see the chart below). Source: New Oriental earnings reports The company is still making significant investments in the online and O2O segment (spending should be around $50 million this year), and the investments should start paying off in the following years. Koolearn.com's revenue was up 32% Y/Y to $9.8 million and the number of paid users has increased 150% Y/Y. The segment's margins are around the breakeven point, but the company eventually expects the operating margin of the online segment above the margins of the offline segment, which means that it is likely to be above 30% given the company's blended operating margin of 29% in fiscal Q1. Once the business scales and as spending peaks, I expect the online segment to have a great impact on EDU's margins. It will probably take two to three years for the online operating margin to be above the offline operating margin and the segment should significantly outgrow the offline business in the following years. If the online segment's operating margin was 30%, the annualized contribution based on the fiscal Q1 revenue should be around $12 million, compared to roughly flat contribution in fiscal Q1. A combination of lower investments and higher revenue growth in the following years should lift EDU's operating margin by at least 200 to 300 basis points in two to three years. The other side of the margin expansion story is the company's focus on cost controls and the growth of the U-Can and POP Kids programs in addition to the increased O2O investments. Management expects investments in O2O to peak this year and the company should reap the benefits of those investments in fiscal 2017 and beyond. The U-Can and POP Kids are still on the lower side when it comes to margins, but as they scale up in the following years, margins should also trend higher. The margin expansion potential in the 3 to 5-year timeframe should be in the 300 to 500 basis points range compared to fiscal 2015 margins. If we assume a 5-year revenue CAGR of 10% to 15% and a net margin in the 19% to 21% range in 5 years (300 to 500 basis points above fiscal 2015 level), we get an EPS range of $2.40 to $3.30. Based on these growth estimates, the company could generate between $1 billion and $1.5 billion in free cash flow in the next five years and bring its net cash balance to $2 billion to $2.5 billion. Applying a conservative P/E of 15 to the expected EPS range gets us to a price target range of $36 and $49, while taking the cash position into consideration would yield a 20% to 30% higher price target. Off course, EDU's solid top line growth and margin expansion expectations are likely to lead to a higher valuation and if we take next fiscal year's EPS estimate of $1.68 and apply a P/E of 20 or 25, we get a price target range of $33.5 and $42. These valuation targets seem achievable through a combination of solid revenue growth and margin expansion in the following years and based on the company's historical valuation trends during margin expansion phases (see chart below). Source: New Oriental earnings reports, Yahoo! Finance I am moving my price target on EDU from $28.5 to $33.5. The new target is based on margin expansion expectations in the following years and next year's P/E of 20. New Oriental is executing its "optimize the market" strategy very well. The company expects to open 30 new learning centers this year and is closing the ones that are not profitable. Top line growth has actually accelerated in local currency and margins have likely bottomed in fiscal 2015 and should start expanding moderately in fiscal 2017 and beyond. Competition and online disruption remain the main risks for EDU and management stated earlier this year that they do not intend to go private, which is a big positive for ADR holders and reduces the anxiety over this issue given the go private mania from China in 2015. The strong balance sheet and strong free cash flow should help protect the downside and I think that the solid growth prospects and the margin expansion potential might lead to P/E expansion in the next two to three years, which should lead to a share price in the mid to high 30's and likely above $40 in 5 years.
