Grand Central: More Evidence of the Weight of China on Global Inflation  - Real Time Economics - WSJ May Jobs Report Likely Keeps Fed on Track Iceland to Speak on Winding Down Capital Controls Last week my colleagues Bob Davis, Lingling Wei and I wrote about deflationary forces hitting the worldâ€™s tire and rubber industries from China. Today in The Wall Street Journal we see how these same forces are hitting another global goods market: junk. James Hagerty and Bob Tita report U.S. exports of scrap materials including cardboard boxes and junked aluminum cans are down 36% since 2011, thanks in part to waning demand from China, which has used U.S. scrap as a raw material to feed its industrial complex . As in many other industries, 2011 proved to be a pivotal year. When the global economy went into tailspin in 2008, Chinaâ€™s authorities responded by stepping up investment and pushing banks to lend more. A real estate boom ensued, as did more money thrown into building factories and infrastructure around them. Chinaâ€™s leadership was seen by many other world leaders as wise, capable and resourceful. Now we see how stepping back from this government-driven investment push is proving painful, with global consequences. The deflationary wind is hitting global goods markets and feeding into the U.S.. As the labor market tightens here, wages show signs of firming. Prices for services, which are especially exposed to domestic wages, are firming too. But goods prices, exposed to global trade, face persistent downward pressure. This could be a weight on overall inflation that plays into the Federal Reserveâ€™s decisions about how aggressively to raise interest rates in the months and years ahead. May Jobs Report Likely Keeps Fed on Track. The strong May employment report likely keeps theÂ Federal ReserveÂ on track to start raising short-term interest rates later this year , but officials are unlikely to move at a policy meeting later this month because they want to see more evidence of a solid economic expansion. They now want to see more data proving the winter economic contraction was transitory and not a signal of a more serious loss of momentum. Many investors are expecting a September rate increase, though Fed officials stress they are not bound to any particular date. Yellen: Fed Was Advised Not to Fully Comply On House Leak Probe. The Fed didnâ€™t provide most of the information requested by members of Congress about an internal investigation because of a criminal probe into the matter , central bank Chairwoman Janet Yellen said Friday. In a letter to Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R., Texas), chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, Ms. Yellen said the Fedâ€™s Office of the Inspector General, which is conducting the criminal probe with the Justice Department, advised that sharing of the information could harm their investigation.Â  Greek Payment Bundling Buys Time. With Greeceâ€™s coffers running dry as it continuesÂ bailout talks, its government is using every trick in the book to avoid default. TheÂ latest move â€“postponing its four June payments to theÂ International Monetary FundÂ until the end of the monthâ€”buys Athens a few more days to negotiate a deal. Itâ€™s not the first time the Greek government hasÂ used obscure IMF rule s Â to pay the international lender. But it is likely the last trick Athens has left to put off the inevitable reckoning with creditors. Turkey’s Central Bank Moves to Support Lira. Turkish assets plummeted and the lira sunk to a record low against the dollar Monday, as political uncertainty gripped markets after the government failed for the first time in more than a decade to win a majority in Sundayâ€™s national elections.Â The slide prompted the central bank to move to support the lira. Iceland to Speak on Winding Down Capital Controls.Â Icelandâ€™s center-right government is widely expected to lay out plans on how to move forward with the winding down of the islandâ€™s strict capital controls on Monday. The government said the prime minister and the finance minister would make an announcement on the lifting of capital controls at a joint news conference on Monday. Chinaâ€™s IPO Market Leaves U.S. in the Dust. China has overtaken the U.S. this year as the worldâ€™s top venue for initial public offerings, riding a steady stream of small-cap listings in Shanghai and Shenzhen together with several multibillion-dollar brokerage IPOs in Hong Kong. Soaring stock prices and higher valuations in Chinese markets have helped spark the rush to list there . -1300 GMT (9 a.m. EDT): ECBâ€™s Nowotny speaks in Vienna -1400 GMT (10 a.m. EDT): ECBâ€™s Mersch speaks in Frankfurt -0550 GMT (1:50 a.m. EDT): ECBâ€™s Liikanen speaks in Helsinki -0800 GMT (4 a.m. EDT): ECBâ€™s Weidmann speaks in Frankfurt -1100 GMT (7 a.m. EDT): ECBâ€™s Makuch speaks in Bratislava, Slovakia -0100 GMT (9 p.m. EDT Tuesday): BOJâ€™s Sato speaks in Kofu, Japan -Bank of Thailand releases a policy statement -0800 GMT (4 a.m. EDT): ECBâ€™s Liikanen speaks in Helsinki -0800 GMT (4 a.m. EDT): ECBâ€™s Hansson speaks in Tallinn, Estonia -Central Bank of Iceland releases a policy statement -Reserve Bank of New Zealand releases a policy statement -Bank of Korea releases a policy statement -1000 GMT (6 a.m. EDT): National Bank of Serbia releases a policy statement -1230 GMT (8:30 a.m. EDT): ECBâ€™s LautenschlÃ¤ger speaks in The Hague, Netherlands -10:30 a.m. EDT: Bank of Canada releases financial system review -11:15 a.m. EDT: BOCâ€™s Poloz speaks at a press conference in Ottawa -Central Bank of Egypt releases a policy statement -0900 GMT (5 a.m. EDT): BOEâ€™s McCafferty speech released RESEARCHÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Liftoff and the Natural Rate of Interest St. Louis Fed Assistant Vice President William Dupor plots four possible versions of the Taylor rule to determine when the Fed should raise rates. â€œMonetary policy rules provide useful yardsticks against which to compare actual FOMC policy actions. I have examined four Taylor rules which each use a distinct measure of the natural rate. All except one of the four place their corresponding Taylor-rule-prescribed target rates above the current federal funds rate as well as the lower bound. Therefore, all but one suggest that the time for liftoff has come,â€? he concludes. An ECB for Fiscal Policy.Â The Bruegel think tank’s Andre Sapir and Guntram B. Wolff Â write that further reform of the eurozone’s governance mechanisms is needed to boost growth and add jobs. One of the priorities should be steps to ensure theÂ co-ordination of an appropriate area-wide fiscal stance that supports the European Central Bankâ€™s monetary policy geared towards price stability. “Fiscal governance should be organised in a â€œEurosystem of Fiscal Policyâ€? (EFP) comparable to the Eurosystem of central bank,” they write. “The EFP would take fiscal policy decisions by majority â€“ which, in times of substantial danger to debt sustainability or a substantial euroÂ area recession, would be binding on the national level.” OPEC Output Unchanged. OPEC on Friday said the cartel would keep its output level at 30 million barrels a day , theÂ second time in six monthsÂ it decided to take no action amid a global glut of crude and weak oil prices. Japanâ€™s economy grew faster than initially estimated in the first quarter, with a rise in capital spending by firms helping power the expansion of the worldâ€™s third largest economy alongside solid exports to the U.S. and China. Chinaâ€™s exports slipped moderately in May while imports tumbled as the worldâ€™s second-largest economy was hit by weak demand at home and abroad. The French economy will continue to grow in the second quarter, although at a slower pace than the start of the year, a survey by the country’s central bank showed Monday–Dow Jones Newswires. The Bank of Russia continued topping up the country’s international reserves on Thursday but reduced the amount of interventions as the ruble weakened, data showed Monday.Â The central bank, which reports its currency interventions with a lag of two working days, bought $131 million on the Moscow exchange on June 4 after buying $200 million the day before–Dow Jones Newswires.
