German budget allows for more spending on migrants, security | Reuters German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble addresses a news conference to presents budget plan 2017 in Berlin, Germany, March 23, 2016. BERLIN The German cabinet approved financing plans on Wednesday that Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said catered for higher spending on migrants, security and infrastructure without having to borrow more money. An influx of 1.1 million migrants last had year raised questions about whether Germany could cover the cost of accommodating and integrating the newcomers without jeopardizing its cherished balanced budget. But Schaeuble, a veteran conservative member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's cabinet, insisted that goal would be met. "We are keeping our word and remain true to our solid financial policies in a difficult environment," Schaeuble said. "We are investing in infrastructure, education and research, we are doing what is needed to guarantee domestic and external security and we are helping migrants - all without (net) new borrowing," he told reporters. Germany is setting aside 10 billion euros to deal with the migrant crisis next year. It expects 800,000 new arrivals this year, and 600,000 next year, Schaeuble said. Overall, the financing plans drawn up by Schaeuble's ministry envisage a 30.9-billion-euro increase in spending to 347.8 billion by 2020, which will be achieved without new net borrowing due largely to rising tax revenues. With unemployment running at a post-reunification low of 6.2 percent and the economy growing steadily, Schaeuble is banking on increased revenues to allow the government's increased spending without incurring a deficit. "It is essential that we refrain from (net) new debt in the upcoming year and in our financial planning until 2020," The government wants to hike spending by 8.6 billion euros in 2017 to 325.5 billion, including 33.7 billion for investment. Economists said Germany was still profiting from reforms introduced more than a decade ago by former Social Democrat (SPD) Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. "Germany continues to reap the rewards of its 2004 'Agenda 2010' labor market reforms," Berenberg Bank economist, Holger Schmieding, said. "With core employment ... up 750,000 year-on-year, German tax receipts and revenues of the social security system are rising so nicely that Germany can afford the extra spending without having to run a deficit," he said. The cabinet will approve final details of the 2017 budget and financing plans up to 2020 on July 6.
