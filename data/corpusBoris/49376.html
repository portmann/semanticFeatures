Learn more about PRO » I am projecting FSFR will report a minor decrease in NAV during the fiscal second quarter of 2015 (NAV per share projection is stated within the article). FSFR closed most deals in its pipeline during the prior quarter which resulted in NII of $0.35 per share. This quarter, I am projecting a â€œnormalizedâ€? level of loan originations. FSFR recently closed a debt financing agreement with Citibank N.A. and in April 2015 began funding â€œFSFR Glick JVâ€? which allows the company to continue to expand its investment portfolio. FSFR has continued to state the company has no intention of issuing shares of common stock below current NAV for the foreseeable future. Even though I am projecting a minor decrease in NAV, I believe FSFR continues to be attractively priced at a material discount to current NAV. Author's Note: This article provides a detailed analysis with supporting documentation on Fifth Street Senior Floating Rate Corp.'s (NASDAQ: FSFR ) projected net asset value ("NAV") per share as of 3/31/2015. I perform this detailed analysis for readers who anticipate/want such an analysis performed each quarter. For readers who just want the summarized conclusions/results of the NAV projection analysis, I would suggest to scroll down to the "Conclusions Drawn" section near the bottom of the article. The focus of this article is to provide a detailed projection of FSFR's NAV per share as of 3/31/2015. Prior to results being provided to the public after the market close on 5/11/2015 (via the company's quarterly press release), I would like to analyze FSFR's NAV as of 3/31/2015 and provide readers a general direction on how I believe this recent quarter has panned out. I will also include my quarterly "net investment income" ("NII") and "net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations" (also known as "earnings per share" ("EPS")) projections in this article. Before we begin the company's NAV projection analysis, I wanted to provide readers my current thoughts in regards to FSFR as a possible equity investment. This should help some readers better understand what is currently occurring within FSFR regarding several key metrics and also assist when reading the NAV projection analysis. My current BUY, SELL, or HOLD recommendation for FSFR will be at the bottom of this section of the article. Currently, I believe there are six reasons why FSFR is an attractive equity investment. First, FSFR trades at a material discount to my projected NAV as of 3/31/2015 (per share figure provided at the end of the analysis below). As of 5/1/2015, FSFR's stock price was $10.80 per share. This calculates to a discount of ($1.58) per share for a price to NAV ratio of 0.8724 (a 12.76% discount). While FSFR's discount to NAV has modestly decreased over the past several months, I still believe investors should see this material discount as an attractive opportunity to currently own this stock. Second, even though FSFR had an annual forward yield to the company's NAV as of 12/31/2014 of 9.58%, the company had an annual forward yield to its stock price as of 5/1/2015 of 11.11%. I believe this current yield, which is currently in excess of 10%, is another positive factor of owning FSFR. Third, FSFR announced it has formed a joint venture ("JV") partnership with members of the Glick Family (GF Funding) to expand the company's investment portfolio. This newly created JV partnership is called "FSFR Glick Family JV LLC" (FSFR Glick JV) and was formed during the fiscal first quarter of 2015. FSFR's affiliate, Fifth Street Finance Corp. (NASDAQ: FSC ), recently created a similar JV partnership with a subsidiary of the Kemper Corporation (NYSE: KMPR ) called "Senior Loan Fund JV 1" (SLF JV 1). FSC's SLF JV 1 continues to generate a higher rate of return when compared to the weighted average of the rest of company's investment portfolio. This is due to the fact management fees are based on the net assets of SLF JV 1 (not gross assets) which is one strategic advantage. By utilizing JV partnerships, FSC can circumvent the business development company ("BDC") debt-to-equity leverage ratio threshold of 1.0x while still maintaining the company's Regulated Investment Company ("RIC") status per the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC"). Similar advantages should occur within FSFR Glick JV when fully funded. Regarding FSFR Glick JV, both parties have committed to provide a combined $100 million of debt and equity to this recently created entity. FSFR will provide $87.5 million and GF Funding will provide $12.5 million. During the fiscal second quarter of 2015, FSFR was in discussions with several lenders regarding debt financing for FSFR Glick JV. As such, I'm not anticipating this JV was fully operational as of 3/31/2015. Even though FSFR Glick JV did not materially affect earnings for the fiscal second quarter of 2015, the benefits of this type of investment structure should begin to have a cumulative effect at some point during 2015. By the end of April 2015, $86.6 million of funding has been provided to invest in a portfolio of senior secured loans. This funding has been provided through equity of $60 million, in accordance with the proportional percentages discussed above, and through FSFR Glick JV's recently secured $200 million revolving credit facility with Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands (Credit Suisse). When calculated, management anticipates FSFR Glick JV will have an investment capacity of approximately $300 million. Management has also stated FSFR will likely have future discussions with other interested third parties to create additional JV partnerships over the next several years. I believe these types of entities should be seen as a positive factor. Fourth, FSFR has recently continued to expand the company's available debt financing. On 10/16/2014, FSFR expanded the company's available debt financing by amending its $100 million Natixis Revolving Credit Facility. FSFR doubled the financing capability of the existing credit facility which now includes a $100 million revolver and a $100 million term loan. The $100 million Natixis Revolving Credit Facility and $50 million Natixis Term Loan are both priced at the commercial paper rate plus 1.9%. The $50 million Fifth Third Bank Term Loan is priced at LIBOR plus 2%. I believe the revolving credit facility and term loans have attractive borrowing rates and have allowed FSFR to continue to expand the company's investment portfolio. Furthermore, during January 2015, management announced FSFR had also closed a $175 million revolving credit facility with Citibank, N.A. (Citi). The Citi Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility is priced at LIBOR plus 2% - 2.25%. I believe this new revolving credit facility is also attractively priced and will allow FSFR to continue to expand the company's investment portfolio over the foreseeable future. I believe the expansion of FSFR's available debt financing, at attractive interest rates, should be seen as a positive factor. Fifth, management has continued to reiterate FSFR does not anticipate issuing shares of common stock below CURRENT NAV for the foreseeable future. This notion has recently been confirmed when, on 3/18/2015, FSFR held the company's 2015 Annual Meeting of Stockholders where there was no proposal for authorization to issue common stock at prices below NAV (unlike 2014's meeting). Even though I have stated I was against the August 2014 equity offering (due to the fact it was materially dilutive to existing shareholders; at the time I did not own the stock), I am comforted management will not perform any further dilutive actions for the foreseeable future. I believe this notion has been further solidified from the recent expansion of FSFR's available debt financing which was discussed earlier. As such, I believe FSFR not performing any dilutive equity offerings for the foreseeable future is another positive factor. Finally, the material decrease in the price of oil during FSFR's fiscal first quarter of 2015 has caused "distress"/speculation to surround most of the oil and gas sector (including parts of the energy sector) regarding falling margins and potential struggling/bankrupt entities. While I would agree markets should have some sort of generalized "cause for concern" within the high-yield debt market, I also believe one needs to "drill down" to each BDC's debt and equity investments to see which portfolio companies could be affected by this event. It should also be noted there has been a recent modest "spike" in oil prices over the past several weeks which generally bodes well for the entire sector. As of 9/30/2014, FSFR had 1.58% of the company's investment portfolio in the oil and gas sector (including certain investments in the energy sector which had "oil and gas" characteristics). As of 12/31/2014, only 0.77% of FSFR's portfolio had debt and equity investments within the oil and gas sector. When compared to the nine other BDC peers I currently cover, this was one of the lowest percentages at potential risk for investment depreciation. As of 12/31/2014, I calculated Apollo Investment Corp. (NASDAQ: AINV ), Main Street Capital Corp. (NYSE: MAIN ), Medley Capital Corp. (NYSE: MCC ), and Prospect Capital Corp. (NASDAQ: PSEC ) had a 18.61%, 6.39%, 6.81%, and 5.16% exposure to the oil and gas sector, respectively (again, including certain investments in the energy sector which had "oil and gas" characteristics). I believe FSFR's recent extremely low exposure to the oil and gas sector (percentage wise) should be seen as a positive sign. FSFR recently closed at $10.80 per share as of 5/1/2015. This was a ($1.58) per share discount to my projected NAV of $12.38 per share as of 3/31/2015. This calculates to a price to NAV ratio of 0.8724 or a discount of (12.76%). From the analysis provided above, including additional factors not analyzed within this article, I currently rate FSFR as a HOLD when I believe the company's stock price is trading at a minor (less than 5%) discount to NAV as of 3/31/2015, a STRONG HOLD when trading at a modest (at or greater than 5% but less than 10%) discount to NAV as of 3/31/2015, and a BUY when trading at a material (at or greater than 10%) discount to NAV as of 3/31/2015. As such, I currently rate FSFR as a BUY. Each investor's BUY, SELL, or HOLD decision is based on one's risk tolerance, time horizon, and dividend income goals. My personal recommendation may not fit each investor's current investing strategy. Overview of FSFR's Projected NAV as of 3/31/2015: Due to the fact that several figures needed to project/calculate FSFR's NAV as of 3/31/2015 come directly from the company's consolidated statement of operations, I provide Table 1 below. Table 1 shows FSFR's consolidated statement of operations from a six-months ended timeframe. Using Table 1 below as a reference, one must add certain account figures from the fiscal first and second quarters of 2015 for purposes of projecting a suitable NAV as of 3/31/2015. (Source: Table created entirely by myself, including all calculated figures and projected valuations) Having provided Table 1 above (in particular FSFR's "Fiscal Six-Months Ended (ESTIMATE)" column), we can now begin to calculate FSFR's projected NAV as of 3/31/2015. This projection will be calculated using Table 2 below. (Source: Table created entirely by myself, including all calculated figures and projected valuations) Using Table 2 above as a reference, let us take a look at the calculation for FSFR's projected NAV as of 3/31/2015. Unless otherwise noted, all figures below are for the "six-months ended" timeframe. Let us look at the following figures (in corresponding order to the "Ref." column shown in Table 2 next to the March 31, 2015 column): Side Note: Predicting certain accounting figures within the BDC sector is usually more difficult when compared to other sectors due to the fair market value ("FMV") adjustments that occur on a company's investment portfolio each quarter. Specifically, the following two FSFR accounts are typically more difficult to project in any given quarter: 1) unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments; and 2) realized gain (loss) on investments. As such, there are several assumptions used when performing such an analysis. FSFR's actual reported values may differ materially from my projected values within this article due to unforeseen circumstances. This could occur because management deviates from a company's prior business strategy and pursues a new strategy that was not previously disclosed or anticipated. This could also occur when the company has a "one-time" extraordinary event which was previously unforeseen. Readers should be aware as such. All projections within this article are my personal estimates and should not solely be used for any investor's buying or selling decisions. All actual reported figures that are above my ranges within this article will be deemed a positive sign in my judgment. All actual reported figures that are below my ranges within this article will be deemed a negative sign in my judgment. - Confidence Within Range = Moderate to High - See Red Reference "A" in Table 2 Above Next to the March 31, 2015 Column This "net increase (decrease) in net assets from operations" figure consists of the following three amounts that come directly from FSFR's consolidated statement of operations: 1) net investment income (see blue reference "A" in Tables 1 and 2 above); 2) net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments (see blue reference "B" in Tables 1 and 2 above); and 3) net realized gain (loss) on investments (see blue reference "C" in Tables 1 and 2 above). Since I have refrained from writing a quarterly consolidated statement of operations projection article for FSFR (due to time constraints), I will summarize what I believe will occur within these three amounts during the fiscal second quarter of 2015. Let us first discuss FSFR's NII account. - Confidence Within Range = Moderate to High FSFR reported NII of $10.4 million for the fiscal first quarter of 2015. I am projecting FSFR will report NII of $8.6 million for the fiscal second quarter of 2015. Using Tables 1 and 2 above as a reference, when combined this is a projected NII of $19.0 million for the six-months ended 3/31/2015. During FSFR's earnings call for the fiscal first quarter of 2015 , management stated the company had a very strong calendar fourth quarter of 2014 regarding loan originations. In fact, management stated most deals that were "in the pipeline" during the fiscal first quarter of 2015 were closed prior to 12/31/2014. As such, this led FSFR to have quarterly loan originations funded at close and add-on investments of $443 million during the fiscal first quarter of 2015. Since FSFR was able to close most investments in the company's pipeline in the prior quarter, management stated its quarterly loan originations funded at close and add-on investments will be more "normalized" during the fiscal second quarter of 2015. As such, I am projecting FSFR had quarterly loan originations funded at close and add-on investments of $200 million during the fiscal second quarter of 2015. As a result of FSFR's current strategy of rotating out of certain assets and taking advantage of deals when appropriate (including generalized trends in the BDC sector as a whole), I am projecting FSFR had portfolio sales/repayments/syndications of ($100) million during the fiscal second quarter of 2015. When combining the company's quarterly loan originations funded at close and add-on investments less portfolio sales/repayments/syndications, I am projecting FSFR's total investment portfolio increased by approximately $100 million for the fiscal second quarter of 2015 (prior to all quarterly FMV fluctuations and scheduled principle payments). As such, quarterly interest and "payment-in-kind" ("PIK") income should modestly increase when compared to the prior quarter. The projected decrease in quarterly NII ($8.6 million for the fiscal second quarter of 2015 versus $10.4 million for the fiscal first quarter of 2015) is mainly attributed to a continued increase in interest income offset by a modest decrease in fee income. I am projecting a modest decrease in FSFR's fee income due to the fact quarterly loan originations and add-on investments will likely experience a slowdown when compared to the prior quarter. In addition, due to FSFR's growing investment portfolio, I am projecting a modest increase in the company's base management fees and interest expense. Now let us discuss FSFR's net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments account. 2) Net Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments: - Confidence Within Range = Moderate to High - See Blue Reference "B" in Tables 1 and 2 Above Next to the March 31, 2015 Column FSFR reported a net unrealized depreciation on investments of ($4.4) million for the fiscal first quarter of 2015. I am projecting FSFR will report a net unrealized depreciation on investments of ($4.0) million for the fiscal second quarter of 2015. Using Tables 1 and 2 above as a reference, when combined this is a projected net unrealized depreciation on investments of ($8.4) million for the six-months ended 3/31/2015. In the prior quarter, the following notable valuation changes occurred within this account: 1) unrealized depreciation of ($0.5) million on Accruent, LLC; and 2) unrealized depreciation of ($0.7) million on Answers Corporation. The remaining net change to this account consisted of numerous minor unrealized FMV fluctuations within the rest of FSFR's investment portfolio. Regarding the fiscal second quarter of 2015, I am partially basing my projection of this account on the fact that all of FSFR's investments are still relatively new (a majority of investments are still only several quarters old). Based on this notion (and several other analytical factors), I am projecting the net change to this account consisted of numerous minor to modest unrealized FMV fluctuations on FSFR's investment portfolio. I am not projecting any "material" FMV write-downs or write-ups. This account's projection is formed from a detailed investment portfolio model that will be omitted from this article due to the sheer size of the data. Now let us discuss FSFR's net realized gain (loss) on investments account. 3) Net Realized Gain (Loss) on Investments: - Confidence Within Range = Moderate - See Blue Reference "C" in Tables 1 and 2 Above Next to the March 31, 2015 Column FSFR reported a net realized loss on investments of ($0.6) million for the fiscal first quarter of 2015. I am projecting FSFR will report a net realized loss on investments of ($0.2) million for the fiscal second quarter of 2015. Using Tables 1 and 2 above as a reference, when combined this is a projected net realized loss on investments of ($0.8) million for the six-months ended 3/31/2015. This projection assumes a portion of the portfolio exits during the quarter were debt investments sold in the open market which either slightly appreciated or depreciated in value. As such, I'm anticipating several minor to modest net realized gains and losses associated with these types of sales to market participants. Let us now combine the three amounts described above to come up with a proper net increase (decrease) in net assets from operations figure for the six-months ended 3/31/2015. When combining NII of $19.0 million, a net unrealized depreciation on investments of ($8.4) million, and a net realized loss on investments of ($0.8) million, I am projecting FSFR had an increase in net assets from operations of $9.8 million for the six-months ended 3/31/2015 (see red reference "A" in Table 2 above). - See Red Reference "B" and Blue Reference "D" in Table 2 Above Next to the March 31, 2015 Column - See Blue Reference "D" in Table 3 Below Side Note: As shown in Table 2 above, FSFR's "net increase (decrease) in net assets from stockholder transactions" figure is the equivalent to the company's "distributions to stockholders from net investment ICTI" figure. Since this is the only amount within this specific classification, both figures will be the same. This is a fairly simple calculation. This is FSFR's dividend distributions for the fiscal first and second quarters of 2015. (Source: Table created entirely by myself, partially using FSFR data obtained from the SEC's EDGAR Database ) Using Table 3 above as a reference, the number of outstanding shares of common stock as of 3/31/2015 is projected to be 29.5 million. This figure is unchanged from FSFR's outstanding shares of common stock as of 12/31/2014. I am also projecting no shares of common stock were issued as part of FSFR's dividend reinvestment plan for the fiscal second quarter of 2015. Since the common stock dividend declared for the fiscal second quarter of 2015 was $0.30 per share, I am projecting a dividend distributions payable of ($8.8) million. When this dividend distributions figure is combined with the three-months ended dividend distributions of ($8.8) million, I am projecting FSFR had a decrease in net assets from stockholder transactions of ($17.7) million for the six-months ended 3/31/2015 (see red reference "B" in Table 2 above and blue reference "D" in Tables 2 and 3 above). - See Red Reference "C" in Table 2 Above Next to the March 31, 2015 Column This "net increase (decrease) in net assets from capital share transactions" figure consists of the following three amounts: 1) issuance of common stock, net (see blue reference "E" in Table 2 above and Table 4 below); 2) issuance of common stock under dividend reinvestment plan, net (see blue reference "F" in Table 2 above and Table 5 below); and 3) repurchases of common stock. - See Blue Reference "E" in Table 2 Above Next to the March 31, 2015 Column - See Blue Reference "E" in Table 4 Below This is FSFR's issuance of common stock, net of underwriting fees and offering costs for the fiscal second quarter of 2015. Since FSFR did not have any equity offerings (which would result in the issuance of common stock) during the fiscal second quarter of 2015, this figure should remain at $0 for the six-months ended 3/31/2015 (see blue reference "E" in Table 2 above and Table 4 below). (Source: Table created entirely by myself, partially using FSFR data obtained from the SEC's EDGAR Database [link provided below Table 1]) 2) Issuance of Common Stock Under Dividend Reinvestment Plan: - See Blue Reference "F" in Table 2 Above Next to the March 31, 2015 Column - See Blue Reference "F" in Table 5 Below This is FSFR's issuance of common stock under the company's dividend reinvestment plan for the fiscal first and second quarters of 2015. (Source: Table created entirely by myself, partially using FSFR data obtained from the SEC's EDGAR Database [link provided below Table 1]) Using Table 5 above as a reference, I am assuming management will repurchase outstanding shares of common stock in the open market for the fiscal second quarter of 2015. This is due to the fact FSFR's stock price, at the time of dividend distributions for the quarter, was materially below the company's NAV of $12.53 per share as of 12/31/2014. FSC repurchases outstanding shares of common stock in the open market to distribute as part of the company's dividend reinvestment plan (net effect of 0 additional outstanding shares of common stock issued). This strategy is implemented when FSC's stock price, at the time of dividend distributions, is priced at a discount to NAV. FSFR has implemented a similar strategy. As such, I am not projecting any additional capital proceeds from the issuance of new shares of common stock under FSFR's dividend reinvestment plan for the fiscal second quarter of 2015. Therefore, I am projecting FSFR will report an issuance of common stock under the company's dividend reinvestment plan figure of $0 for the six-months ended 3/31/2015 (see blue reference "F" in Tables 2 and 5 above). - See Table 2 Above Next to the March 31, 2015 Column for Reference Management may intend to repurchase outstanding shares of common stock when FSFR's stock price is at a material discount to the company's NAV. Even though FSFR's stock price, throughout the entire quarter, continued to trade below the company's NAV of $12.53 per share as of 12/31/2014, I am assuming management did not initiate any share buybacks during the fiscal second quarter of 2015. In my opinion, it would not make too much sense to repurchase outstanding shares of common stock when in August 2014 FSFR issued new shares of common stock at a material discount to NAV as of 6/30/2014. Do not get me wrong, issuing shares at a net issuance price of $12.19 per share and then repurchasing a portion of these outstanding shares at a projected weighted average price of $10.60 per share would be net accretive to FSFR's NAV. However, I do not believe FSFR would pursue such a strategy due to the fact the management wanted to use the net proceeds from the August 2014 equity offering to expand the company's investment portfolio. FSFR also needs to consider certain RIC leverage ratio thresholds to remain in compliance with the IRC. Therefore, I am projecting FSFR will report a repurchases of common stock figure of $0 for the six-months ended 3/31/2015 (see Table 2 above). When combining net equity proceeds in common stock issuances of $0, net equity proceeds in relation to the company's dividend reinvestment plan of $0, and equity in relation to repurchases of common stock of $0, I am projecting FSFR had no change in net assets from capital share transactions for the six-months ended 3/31/2015 (see red reference "C" in Table 2 above). To sum up all the information discussed above, I am projecting FSFR will report the following NAV per share as of 3/31/2015: FSFR's Projected NAV as of 3/31/2015 = $12.38 Per Share FSFR's Projected NAV Range as of 3/31/2015 = $12.23 - $12.53 Per Share This projection is a decrease of ($0.15) per share from FSFR's NAV as of 12/31/2014. This minor decrease in NAV can be attributed to the following quarterly per share changes: (Source: Table created entirely by myself, including all calculated figures and projected valuations) Using Table 6 above as a reference, I am projecting FSFR's net increase in net assets resulting from operations (also known as EPS) will be $0.15 per share for the fiscal second quarter of 2015 (rounded to the nearest cent). In comparison, I am projecting FSFR had dividend distributions of ($0.30) per share for the fiscal second quarter of 2015 (also rounded to the nearest cent). After adding these two amounts together, a decrease of ($0.15) per share for the fiscal second quarter of 2015 is obtained. Again, the main reason for the projected minor decrease in NAV is in relation to investment depreciation within several of FSFR's portfolio companies during the fiscal second quarter of 2015. With that being said, I believe FSFR's projected decrease in NAV of (1.21%) for the fiscal second quarter of 2015 will be less severe when compared to several of the other BDC stocks I currently cover in the sector. I believe FSFR's projected less severe NAV decrease (percentage wise) should be seen as a positive sign in an anticipated volatile lower middle market ("LMM") lending environment.
