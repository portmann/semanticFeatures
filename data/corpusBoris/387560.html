Canada's transit system, which includes Toronto's streetcars, is slated to receive federal stimulus money in a budget that boosts spending on public infrastructure. Photo: Todd Korol/Toronto Star/Getty Images In my column this week I noted that by pursuing more fiscal and less monetary stimulus, Canadaâ€™s new Liberal government was following the formula Â recommended by the International Monetary Fund, the Group of 20 top economies, and Harvard Universityâ€™s Larry Summers. It can do thisÂ thanks, I noted, to its pristine balance sheet. Federal debt is just 31% of gross domestic product, the lowest of the Group of Seven big economies. The column drew several critical remarks. Some readers noted that Canadaâ€™s debt burden is much larger if you include the debts of the provinces, especially Ontario and Quebec. Indeed, that raises its â€œgeneral government gross debt,â€? which includes all levels of debt, to 92%, higher than Germanyâ€™s and in line with Britain. However, Canadaâ€™s â€œgeneral government net debt,â€? which adds in central and subnational debt and subtracts financial assets such as pension-plan holdings, is just 28% of GDP this year, still by far the lowest in the G-7. Germany, the next lowest, is at 47%. The U.S. is at 82%. So by most objective measures, Canadaâ€™s relative fiscal strength prevails. (These figures are all from the IMFâ€™s latest fiscal monitor .) Some correspondents said Canada has a problem with rising health spending. True, but itâ€™s actually less bad than most countries. The present value of higher health-care spending between now and 2050 equals 40% of Canadaâ€™s GDP, which is roughly half the average of the G-7. The present value of higher pension spending equals 24% of GDP, marginally higher than the G7 average. At current contribution rates Canadaâ€™s national pension plan is fully funded over the next 75 years, whereas U.S. Social Security will not be solvent without reduced benefits or higher contributions. So while provincial debt and elderly obligations are problems, neither undermines the logic of the relatively modest fiscal stimulus Canada is now employing, especially since unemployment has risen in Canada in the last year while in the U.S., Japan, Britain and the eurozone, itâ€™s fallen. As in most of the world, the interest rates Canada pays on the national debt are lower than the growth of nominal GDP, so it can safely sustain higher levels of debt than when that relationship was reversed. Still, the Liberalsâ€™ approach has some shortcomings. Theyâ€™ve appropriately noted that Canadaâ€™s potential growth looks dismal due to an aging population, which limits labor-force growth, and poor productivity. It uses this to justify the stimulus money spent on public infrastructure, such as for public transit. But infrastructure is only 43% of new federal spending over the next two years. Most of the remainder represents higher social transfers such as child benefits that have been enriched and subjected to more means-testing, relaxed criteria for receiving unemployment insurance, and cancellation of a higher retirement age for one elderly benefit. These reflect the Liberalsâ€™ priority of narrowing inequality but are also disincentives to work, which will undermine the governmentâ€™s overarching goal of raising potential growth. They also permanently raise spending and thus may endanger Canadaâ€™s admirably disciplined fiscal profile. The government says the debt-to-GDP ratio will be back to last yearâ€™s level by 2021 but has been criticized for lack of detail on how it will get there. The budget may also delay essential changes to Canadaâ€™s industrial mix. In previous years the oil and commodity price boom elevated Canadaâ€™s dollar, making it harder for its manufacturers to compete in overseas markets. The shock to oil and commodity prices has now rendered a lot of the resource base unprofitable. The accompanying drop in the Canadian dollar is supposed to help other tradable products, notably manufacturing and high-value services, fill the gap. But as my column notes, fiscal stimulus has led the Bank of Canada to defer interest rate cuts, sending the Canadian dollar higher. That will slow Canadaâ€™s structural adjustment. Finally, some readers noted that Justin Trudeauâ€™s Liberals are simply reaping the rewards of the fiscal discipline of Stephen Harperâ€™s Conservatives, who were defeated in last fallâ€™s election. Thatâ€™s true, but Mr. Harper inherited the fiscal discipline of theÂ Liberal governments of Jean Chretien and Paul Martin from 1993 to 2003. Through rigorous, small-C conservative budgeting they took Canada from one of the most to one of the least indebted countries in the G7, entrenched the Bank of Canadaâ€™s 2% inflation target, which it has consistently met, put the Canada Pension Plan on the path to solvency, enacted several steep cuts in the corporate tax rate and left Mr. Harper a reasonably well-regulated financial system that survived the global financial crisis largely unscathed. If Mr. Trudeau reawakens Canadaâ€™s debt demons, it wonâ€™t be just a Conservative fiscal legacy he squanders, but that of his own Liberals. Previous Alexander Hamilton's Fifth-Great-Grandson: 'We Really Did Not Think We Could Win This' Back in the early 1990s the debt load caused by the left was crushing Canada - it was a basket case. The conservatives come in cleaned up the mess, and now this leftist is reverting back to the old form - tax and spend. Taking on more debt necessarily means an increased present value of taxes equal to the increase in debt. Â Â  Basic economics indicates that higher tax rates result in less of whatever is taxed and, generally, as tax rates increase the elasticity of the supply of whatever is taxed increases as well.Â Â Â Furthermore, virtually all elasticities are higher over long periods of time than over short periods of time.Â Â Â Â  This means that to the extent that market participants believe that the debt will eventually be repaid through income taxes, the producers of income will plan their affairs to have less future income in Canada.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  That is not good for Canadians.Â Â  @Chris Petruzzi Oh I'm sure once the Canadian politicians start handing out the "free" money to their happy constituents that they'll be disciplined to stop at a prudent debt level...
