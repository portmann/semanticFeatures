Are Income And Spending Growth Peaking? | Seeking Alpha This is weighing on personal expenditure readings. Both retail and auto stocks could decline in 2016 as slowing growth continues. U.S. personal income and spending growth have been on the rise since 2012, but those measures look to be topping out currently. Below is the chart of U.S. real disposable income. The figure came in at 2.88% annual growth in the most recent month. Income growth has been fueled by lower inflation costs, as well as a healthier labor market. The income figure is also approaching levels experienced prior to the financial crisis. The gradual slowdown in the figure, however, portends a possible slowdown in spending in future months. Below is a chart of real personal consumption. Consumption rose steadily alongside disposable income, but also looks to be leveling off in recent months. In November, the consumption figure came in at 3.3% annual growth, relatively unchanged since June. Tightening credit markets, as well as slowing income growth have weighed on consumer's ability to spend. With consumers choosing to save at elevated levels, this too could be a hindrance to consumer spending in coming months. For equity markets, particular sectors could be affected by such a slowdown in consumption. First is the obvious, SPDR S&P Retail (NYSEARCA: XRT ) could lag broader markets as same store sales weaken in the U.S. due to slowing spending and incomes. Furthermore, automakers, who have benefited greatly from added personal income, could see weakening sales amid the slowdown. CarMax (NYSE: KMX ), Ford Motor (NYSE: F ), and General Motors (NYSE: GM ) have all seen share price weakness in 2015 as consumer spending slowed. Two popular short opportunities currently lie with both KMX and XRT, who have seen selling pressure amid broader financial market volatility. Initiating shorts at present levels could be profitable as both are expected to lag general markets in 2016. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
