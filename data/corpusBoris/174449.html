And welcome to Analogic's fourth quarter and year-end conference call for fiscal 2015. Earlier today, after the market closed, we issued a press release describing the financial results for our fourth quarter and year-end. If you have not yet downloaded the press release, you can do so now via our Web site at investor.analogic.com. Before we review our fourth quarter and year-end results, I would like to remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements such as comments about our plans, expectations and projections. For more information on risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from our forward-looking statements, please refer to our most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q reports on file with the SEC. Also on today's call, we will be discussing certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP. We believe that using non-GAAP metrics provide investors a more thorough understanding of our business. An explanation and a reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures are provided at the end of the presentation and in our fourth quarter and year-end press release. Thanks Mark. Good afternoon everybody. Let's move to Slide 4 of the presentation, please. In the quarter, we recorded revenue of $154 million, that's up 9% or 11% on a constant currency basis. Gross margins came in at about 41%, rounding down 2 points with 1 point impact from currency. On a GAAP basis operating margin was 10%, that's up 2 points from last year. And non-GAAP operating margin came in flat at 14%. GAAP earnings per share was $0.86, that's down $0.03 and includes a $0.12 reserve relating to the BK Medical distributor matter and Mike will give you a little more information on the topic in a few minutes. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.28 that's down $0.08 from last year in the quarter. As for overall business highlights in the quarter, Medical Imaging was down in the quarter with margins remaining strong. Ultrasound continued strong performance delivering double-digit growth in spite of currency impacts and we saw Security and Detection swing back to growth. Let’s move to Slide 5. Take a look at the reporting and take a look at the year. For the full year revenue came in at $540 million, that's up 4% as reported and 6% on a constant currency basis. Gross margin came in at 42%, flat from last year, however adjusted for currency our gross margin would have been up a point. GAAP operating margin measured 8%, that's up 2 points from last year. And non-GAAP operating margin was 12% and that's up a point. GAAP earnings per share was $2.66, that's down $0.06. Although on an apples-to-apples basis, when we exclude the net effect of tax and BK matter reserve we're actually up $0.68. Non-GAAP earnings per share came in at $4.05 and that's up $0.53 from last year. Now let’s to move Slide 6 and take a look at the business highlights in the year. Medical Imaging revenue was down around 1%, impacted by currency and a slowing China market. We're happy to see Siemens receive the FDA approval on the 3D Tomosynthesis System with our direct conversion selenium detectors. CT and Mammography growth offset some softness in MRI subsystems. We launched our new generation mid-tier MRI Gradient subsystems to support emerging market growth and we continue to ramp-up our highly ruggedized private label CT shipments in China. Our Ultrasound business had 9% revenue growth, which is actually up 14% when you look at it on a constant currency basis. North America continued strong double-digit growth of over 20%. Europe and EMEA distributors declined to 5%, but on a constant currency basis actually grew 7%. China sales were up strong, though offset by rest of Asia distributors who were affected by the strong dollar. We saw a successful introduction of our TriCore based flagship bk3000 with over 100 units shipped. Our Private label development with a larger multinational healthcare equipment supplier is on schedule for first half fiscal '16 production launch. And extended dialysis studies for Sonic Window are building the case for market entry. Security and Detection revenue came in strong with 17% year-on-year growth. Sales growth was driven by mid and high speed shipments and strong internationally. We saw some nice wins from both our customers in the high speed space with Smiths securing some of their first significant wins. Rapid DNA and shipments to the Department of Defense and the FBI continues its testing for law enforcement. Thanks Jim, and good evening everyone. Please turn to Slide 7, and I'll review our financial performance for the fourth quarter and for our fiscal year 2015. Please notice the boxes on the revenue and gross margin charts on the top of the page that indicate the timing of the currency impact we experienced in fiscal 2015. Please look first at the revenue chart in the upper left. You will see that Q4 was our strongest quarter of the year. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $154 million, up 9% in the same period last year and up 11% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth in our Ultrasound and in our Security and Detection segments. At $540 million our fiscal year 2015 revenues are up 4% compared to fiscal year 2014 and up 6% on a constant currency basis again driven by growth in Ultrasound and in Security and Detection. Our revenues for the quarter and fiscal year reflect unfavorable currency rates, primarily associated with the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar and weakening of the euro which had an unfavorable impact on the revenues of approximately two percentage points of growth for the quarter and for the fiscal year. The chart in the upper right hand of the page shows our gross margin trend. Our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin in the quarter was down about two percentage points compared to the same quarter last year primarily due to unfavorable currency rates. Our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin was flat for the fiscal year, but up one point for the year on a constant currency basis reflecting the unfavorable currency rates. We continue to see improvements in operating efficiency throughout our global manufacturing operations including continued growth at our Shanghai facility. The lower portion of Page 7 shows our operating profitability trends. Non-GAAP operating income in the quarter increased by $2 million as compared to the fourth quarter of last year with the higher revenues being partially offset by lower gross margin. On a full year basis, our non-GAAP operating income is up 16% as compared to the prior fiscal year reflecting our higher revenue and flat gross margin. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased by less than one percentage point for the fourth quarter and for the fiscal year compared to 2014. However, operating expenses are down as a percent of revenue for both the fourth quarter and for the full fiscal year on a non-GAAP basis. On a margin basis in the bottom right hand corner, our 14% non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter is flat compared to the same quarter last year. And on a fiscal year basis our non-GAAP operating margin is up one point which is in line with our guidance. Please turn to Slide 8 for a look at our fourth quarter P&L results. As I mentioned, revenue was up 9% for the quarter and gross margin is down two percentage points primarily due to unfavorable currency rates. Our higher revenue was driven by increases in both Ultrasound and Security and Detection. I will walk you through our segment performance in more detail shortly. As I noted earlier, our non-GAAP operating expenses increased by less than 1% in the quarter as a percentage of revenue with two points lower in Q4 of 2014. We continue to focus on cost management. I also wanted to mention as was noted in more detail in our press release earlier today, we recorded an accrual of $1.6 million relating to discussions with the SEC in connection with their investigation of our Danish subsidiary. In the tax area you will see that our tax rate for the quarter reflects a 32% rate on a GAAP basis. This includes the impact of the $1.6 million accrual associated with the initial settlement offer to the SEC that I just discussed, which resulted in an unfavorable impact of $0.12 of EPS in the current quarter on a GAAP basis. If you'll turn to Slide 9 I'll review our income statement for fiscal year 2015. On a year-to-date basis, our revenue was up 4% compared with last year. As I noted earlier, we lost approximately two points of growth due to the unfavorable foreign currency. We saw growth in Ultrasound and in Security and Detection with Medical Imaging revenues reflecting a 1% decline from last year. This was in line with our expectations. Gross margin is flat in a non-GAAP basis, but up one point in a constant currency basis, with operating expenses up slightly, less than 1% for the year, but down one point as a percent of revenue compared to fiscal year 2014. This has allowed us to improve our non-GAAP operating margin by about two points to 12% for the fiscal year. Our tax rate for the year was about 18% which is in line with our Q3 comments. This also reflects the $1.6 million accrual associated with the initial settlement offer to the SEC for the BK Medical inquiry and $3 million of tax benefits in the third quarter of fiscal ’15. For fiscal year 2016, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 26% and 28%. Please turn to Slide 10 and our operating performance by segment. Our Medical Imaging revenues for the quarter totaled $81 million, a 4% decrease compared to the same period of last year on higher Q4 2014 sales in CT and Mammography. Non-GAAP operating margin in the Medical Imaging segment was down slightly versus Q4 of last year, but remained strong at 18% on a non-GAAP basis. For fiscal year 2015 Medical Imaging revenues were down about 1% compared with fiscal year ’14 with improvements in CT being offset by softness in MRI and our non-GAAP operating margin was up about 1 point compared to fiscal year 2014. In Ultrasound our revenues grew 17% for the quarter over last year and grew 26% on a constant currency basis. Our growth in the quarter reflects increased sales in North America and direct sales in Europe. Our non-GAAP operating margin of 5% is down 1 point compared with last year, but would have reflected a 1 point increase compared to Q4 of 2014 when taking in account the unfavorable impact of foreign currency during the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, revenues were up 9% or 14% on a constant currency basis, again driven by growth in North America. Our non-GAAP operating margin was down 1 point in the same period last year but flat on a constant currency basis. Our Security and Detection revenues increased 51% in the fourth quarter compared to the same quarter of fiscal year 2014 driven primarily by the timing of the high speed market as we have previously discussed. Our backlog in this segment remains high at $39 million. Our non-GAAP operating margin also improved 6 points from Q4 of last year on higher revenue. On a year-to-date basis, revenues were 17% and non-GAAP operating margin was also 17%, up 6 points from the same period last year. In addition, our non-GAAP operating margin was unfavorably impacted by 5 points for the quarter and 2 points for the year due to the shipment of some Rapid DNA systems in the quarter where we did not recognize the associated revenue. Please turn now to Slide 11. We generated $13 million in operating cash flows in the quarter and $39 million for the fiscal year. Our cash balance increased by $4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and $9 million for the year. During the quarter, capital expenditures remained low at $3 million and were $10 million for this fiscal year. For fiscal year 2016, we expect our capital expenditures to be in the high-teens. Our free cash flows were $10 million for the quarter and $29 million for the current year. Before I turn the call back over to Jim, I want to briefly discuss the restructuring plan for fiscal year 2016 which was announced today. Plan includes a transition of certain manufacturing activities from our Peabody location to our existing facility in Shanghai, China. A reduction in force in order to align our research and development investment with expected customer funding in our Security and Detection business and a voluntary retirement program available to eligible employees in the affected areas of our Peabody facility. As part of the rebalancing of our operations, we have decided to transfer production of selected subsystems in the Medical Imaging segment from Peabody to Shanghai where we expect more end customer demand. The transfer will enable our success in this fast growing market. Our Peabody facility will remain as our core manufacturing center. We expect to complete the implementation of the plan by the end of fiscal 2016 and we expect to incur total pretax charges of approximately $6 million. Of this amount, we expect to incur charges of approximately $3 million in the first quarter of 2016 and the balance in the remainder of the fiscal year. We also expect annual savings on a pretax basis of approximately $4 million in fiscal 2016 and $9 million in fiscal 2017. Thanks Mike. Okay if we move on to Slide 12, we see the Medical Imaging revenues stabilizing and recovering through the year and expect full year revenue to be roughly flat. Mid-tier MRI demand from our Chinese OEM customers should help offset overall softening in China. Our CT mix continued shifting towards higher content ruggedized to private label systems in China and our Mammography outlook is improving on Siemens’ FDA Pre-Market Approval for 3D in the United States. Ultrasound continued strong double-digit revenue growth and delivers improving margins. Our bk3000 guided Ultrasound platform will drive growth in Urology and expand and help drive growth in guided surgery and point of care. Our private label offering with a large multinational partner is on track to enter production in the first half of FY16. And we expect to see Sonic Window’s initial offering in the dialysis applications later in this year and our advanced version begin devaluations in the broader vascular excess market. Coming off of a very strong FY15 Security and Detection plans for modest growth, the U.S. replacement is expected to stay steady at current levels, international drives growth in high speed with L3 and Smiths securing wins. And Rapid DNA continues with DOD shipments along with supporting continued FBI testing. We expect to see the U.S. Law Enforcement slowly developing as testing is taking longer than anticipated and indications our testing could continue to the end of this calendar year. So for FY16 we expect continuing revenue growth in the mid single-digits and combined with our focus on cost we expect to deliver non-GAAP operating margin expansion of approximately one point. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen the floor is now open for your questions. [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Larry Solow with CJS Securities. Please go ahead. So John could you just clarify on the guidance the 100 bp operating margin target, I guess that does include the 4 million savings that you will expect to get from the restructuring in the first year is that right? So then not much additional improvement I guess is that fair to because I guess that would drive probably about 75 bps of the improvement right, so is that fair to say? Well I don’t these are like the split hairs where we typically add as we some cost improvements with actions like this it's going to be a certain amount of replacement of certain levels of labor, some people will be taking the voluntary retirement and will need to be backfilled. Also just in general there will be other puts and takes across the business and so we had targeted to see a full point of improvement on a year-over-year basis. And then in the CT, morphology and Mammography, I assume you expect some growth from that? And then the second question is it sounds like from the prepared comments that you’ll recover during the year so I guess the whole segment will sort of be, I guess modestly down in the first half and then a little bit up in the second is that a good way to look out or? Well I’d say we see earlier in the year and like in the first quarter-ish and earlier in the first half some as you saw in Q4 there was some downward pressure, we’ve all heard a lot about it not only with some of the issues associated with the strong dollar, but also we all are hearing and seeing some slowing of growth in China. We saw that some of that in Q4, you saw in the Medical Imaging segment and we expect that to continue into Q1 and keep in mind if you want us always, it's always one of our weaker quarters and it's where we by design we’ll do things like bringing all of our sales reps, we’ll go through all the training for the new product launches. So there is always some reduced efficiency in Q1 as we really prep for the year. So we see all those together really giving us and strengthening through the year, but in Medical Imaging like you see there is going to be some puts and takes after we did we thought that some of the areas are going to be a little stronger like mammography, some of the areas will be a little weaker, but net-net we think overall in the year we’ll see that about flatten out and we’ll give you a little better guidance as the quarters go by and we get a little better visibility. And just in Ultrasound obviously a very solid quarter, nice outlook as well, are you building in some sales from private label and I assume not so much on the Sonic Window side yet, is that more comfortable? Yes that’s exactly right, I’ve been pretty bullish on the private label opportunity and we see that starting in the first half, but really it’s starting to kick-in in more production level type numbers as we get into Q3 and Q4. So second half that additional growth loads into that business for us, so we see in Ultrasound we’re really excited about Ultrasound. And that same kind of timing would probably apply we would think on the Sonic Window too, but keep in mind Sonic Window a smaller level initially going will be offered into dialysis it’s a somewhat limited market. So if not the bigger market we’re looking at that as we get into the more general vascular assets. But either way getting started in this one great application is a really good start for us. But it does add in as we look at coming in and typically I would say that your Q1 and Q3 would typically go with your quarters. And this year again we see a lot of new things coming in as we get into little late in Q2 and into Q3. So we may start to see improvement in Q3 and as we just kind of look to in general morphology as a business throughout the year. And then just on Security and Detection it seems like more of a modest year next year I guess in terms of Rapid DNA, it sounds like you are some of those trials have gone on longer than expected. So, hard to really gauge what are you going to do in the coming years or maybe you keep that sort of flat, is that where you are looking? I guess the first point, as we had such a strong recovery this last year. With 17% to expect that kind of growth and predict that going into the next year, would really be -- I wouldn't have anything, so I wouldn't want to point to that at this point. You know how the visibility is in that space. Big numbers that can move off and on through across the quarter or your boundary and certainly anything as you know, we've a lot of experience with doing business that eventually goes to the U.S. government and such. And when you get into these testing cycles, we just -- we need to be careful about our expectation of timing something like the FBI’s work and when that generates production and growth in law enforcement. So at the same time we do see enhancing continued nice shipments into the Department of Defense. And we've all read about some of the uses of Rapid DNA overseas in military applications and Department of Defense application. But I just want to be careful about setting expectations on how fast things start to ramp on the U.S. FBI and law enforcement side that does have to go through and complete this testing cycle. We believe we're going to see it here within the calendar year but we all have to be careful with that and that kind of testing is required not just for U.S. but certain countries outside of U.S. look to the U.S. and look to the FBI and how they do things like fingerprinting and the tools and such that they use for this kind of testing and this kind of application. Thank you for your question. [Operator Instructions] The next question will come from Jason Wittes with Brean Capital. Please go ahead. So, just a follow up on the FBI evaluation, I thought, your initial thought was that you'd get a response by the end of the summer, I guess it is just the government's leisurely timeline or what's causing delay in your thinking about when they may decide on this evaluation and in addition to that, does that evaluation does really spur any purchase orders, because I know some states have already commented that they were interested in employing this at their local forensics? Yes, we have a lot of experience with the government levels of certification testing with the TSA and such and it is just the time -- their timelines and there time constants are probably run a little different than our typical business. So I just wanted to be careful that we don’t set hard expectations when we know the government is going to have -- they have had series of questions, we expect them. The big things just don't happen all that fast sometime, they are typically very nice that we -- what we can count on is often that being able to predict delay, it's difficult but you could predict if there's anything that's going to be -- could be a delay but we're certainly the FBI has just commented publically on their interest in this technology, states have commented, there is a lot of support for this kind of capability. There is a lot of interest in it but it does takes some time and I just don't want to be overly optimistic with this and how much time it takes for that part to get done that is difficult to predict. And as far as enabling new business, there is no question that when this -- as this gets approved, assuming it gets approved that will enable some additional demand from states preparing to get ready for the testing and to be able to connect. As I have said in the past also, there are some professional actions that need to take place, that are being talked about and there's bills both in the Senate and on how that are addressing this topic that will help clear the way better for the states to be much more active in this space. Our thought is the initial testing should at least enable some of the Federal level and some of the countries outside the U.S. that are look to the U.S. for verification that the products are right. Okay. I mean, is it going to be in terms of growth at all this year or is it you just assuming sort of like? It was the part of some of our growth not a lot last year. We think it will be part of our growth this year. So again I just we see it as somewhat modest until some of these approvals for done and we can better quantify and line up and validate pipelines. By the way, you had, I think in the past mentioned something around $6 million figure for '15, is that about where things? Yes, last year we were -- it was around that number, now you made those that if you -- that Mike had indicated that we didn't take full revenue recognition for all of it, I like treating something like this conservatively both in terms of our expectations and in when we think about revenue recognition and a lot of -- when you look at some of these more startup type companies and advanced technologies sometimes, it will takes a little while for them to work out the business cycles and we need to be predictable with this. So, you will see some conservatism there as far as how -- what we record and how that grows, but certainly we're expecting this to be a nice opportunity for us and with a really good position. And just on the Ultrasound business, the private label offering, I assume, we're going to start to see an impact, you say the first half, I am assuming in the first quarter that seems like it's basically stocking at this point? There will be some in the first quarter but not a lot because it's we expect to see the launching happening in the second quarter and even that takes some ramping up, but yes, as you get into the some in the first quarter, second quarter ramping, you're going to be having units going out to demo units and such to build reps you're going to have then you'll see the -- the real things start to kick in as you get end of the second half. It's just that, I just looking at your scriptures, say your contract for toleration in the first half or just you're saying, second half will be the -- you'll start to see a gain in the market for the second half is really where you're going to see the growth? Well, yes, the second half where you're right, we really expect to see the acceleration, certainly it's going to be some in the first half, I mean it certainly -- it'll be measurable for us, but as you really get into production and people demolish this some, have the budget for it, start to take unit, that really starts to accelerate as we get into the second quarter and then beyond in the second half. And I know there's a lot of block and tackling to be done here but frankly it could be your biggest opportunity right now in Ultrasound is that the right way to be thinking about over the next few years what the private label still represents? I don't know that I’d say it's the biggest because we've got a lot of things developing here and hopefully you will come to our investor presentation, you're going to see the rollout and the launch of the new things that are going to be, not only -- I'd like people to talk about this particular opportunity with private label but also, you guys see some various things that we think are really going to be open up our direct guide those markets too. So, we're -- it's hard to say where we are going to see the biggest component but I think you're right though, this should be a big opportunity for us we're pretty excited about it. That’s a fair clarification. And then just lastly for the Mammography business, how do you see that developing now that Siemens finally got FDA approval, is that I mean I think we're all assuming there was going to be some contribution this year? Yes, I think it will be, certainly we expect it will -- that'll be a part of some growth in that business but again we're offsetting other issues back and forth. I'll try to give an overall net view, but in general I mean that's certainly good business with good yields, and really strong margins, and a good contributor to the business. And it's certainly if it's nothing else, strengthens our stock in that whole segment. Thank you for the question. [Operator Instructions] We have follow-up questions from Jason Wittes with Brean Capital. Please go ahead. I do have a follow-up and that is, the SEC proposed settlement. Do you have timing on sort of when that might become official? And what the next milestone is going to be in terms of us getting more clarity on how that milestone dawns? I'd ask Mike to comment on it. I don't know that he could really say much more than what we said but Mike? Yes, Jason. So, I mean we began settlement discussions with the SEC in Q4. And as you notice, it's a non-GAAP charge of 1.6 million in connection with financial settlement proposal. I mean I think the background of this is in our K's and our Q's and also we've an update as you probably saw at Page 3, of the earnings release today. I'm sure you'll appreciate that at this point we really can't say a lot more than that. Thank you. There're no further questions at this time. Actually we do have a question from Larry Solow, CJS Securities. Please go ahead. Just on the gross margins for the quarter, down I think couple of hundreds of bps or probably extra currency about hundred bps down, any particular reason for that, if we strip out the currency is it a mix issue or? I think the two things I look at is certainly the one is, the currency is the biggest impact but I think some of the revenue recognition that we talked about with some of [Multiple Speakers] no question, that can move the needle a little bit there too. And does that revenue ever get recognized? Is it just sort of timing thing or the conservatism your customer set the delivery or it’s still on inventory or what is sort of the…? It is like -- Mike is saying I’d rather have some sitting in AR than in inventory, so, I certainly would hope and expect that we get paid, and it's a timing issue yes. Thank you for your question. There are no further questions at this time. I'll now turn the call back to Mr. Green for closing comments. All right I want to thank everybody for listening in today.
