Fitch: UK Faces Fiscal Continuity, Constitutional Uncertainty | Reuters (The following statement was released by the rating agency) LONDON, May 08 (Fitch) The UK general election result reduces near-term  uncertainty about fiscal policy, but raises long-term constitutional issues,  Fitch Ratings says.  The narrow Conservative majority gives greater, but not complete, clarity on the  future path of fiscal consolidation. Both the Conservative and Labour parties  were committed to reducing the fiscal deficit in the next parliament, and  supported the fiscal mandate set out in the Charter for Budget Stability. But  the prospect of a hung parliament, to which opinion polls had been pointing  throughout the campaign, and possibly a minority government, had raised the risk  that making and implementing fiscal policy would become more difficult.  The Conservatives have said they aim to balance the cyclically adjusted current  budget by 2017-2018, two years earlier than Labour's pre-election commitment,  and using a different balance of revenue and spending measures. Consolidation  therefore looks set to continue broadly in line with the March budget and Office  for Budget Responsibility (OBR) projections. But certain details of the  Conservative programme, such as the composition of planned welfare cuts, remain  to be spelt out.  The fiscal mandate, particularly the five-year rolling deficit target, provides  substantial flexibility, giving future governments the option to avoid  pro-cyclical fiscal tightening in response to weaker economic conditions. But  this flexibility may be hindered by pre-election commitments to protect large  categories of spending and rule out rises in several major tax categories.  The OBR enhances fiscal transparency and credibility, increasing political  incentives to correct budgetary imbalances. But missing or delaying targets for  the cyclically adjusted current deficit could reduce fiscal credibility, in our  view.  UK debt to GDP remains among the highest of 'AA' and 'AAA' category sovereigns.  Further deficit reduction that resulted in a lower and steadily declining  government debt ratio would support the UK rating at 'AA+'. The election will increase pressures for lasting broader constitutional reform,  particularly after the Scottish National Party won 56 seats in Scotland.  Negotiations about devolution of fiscal responsibility to Scotland will further  complicate the fiscal picture. The final arrangement is still unknown but  Scotland's relatively small share of the UK economy (around 10%) means the  resulting fiscal risks to the UK are likely to be manageable. The UK starts from  a position of relative strength in fiscal policymaking. We would not expect the  overall fiscal framework to be significantly weakened by further fiscal  devolution.  But its slim majority could present a political challenge for the new  administration as it seeks to implement its fiscal, UK constitutional, and  European policy agenda. UK constitutional reform will need cross-party support,  and the government could face internal dissent over Europe.  David Cameron has promised an "in-out" referendum on the UK's EU membership by  the end of 2017, after a loosely defined renegotiation. A firm judgement on the  sovereign credit impact of the UK leaving the EU (opinion polls indicate  meaningful support for membership) is not possible at this stage, because the  terms of the exit scenario are highly uncertain. Negotiating the shape of a UK  exit would be lengthy and complicated, and a wide variety of outcomes are  possible. This prolonged uncertainty could dent UK economic growth by weighing  on confidence and investment.
