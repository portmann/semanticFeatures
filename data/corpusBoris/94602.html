Sentiment Aiding Euro Strength | Seeking Alpha Consumer sentiment in the euro area is rising. Moreover, rising wages and low inflation are leading to increased purchasing power for households. Even with geopolitical strife in the currency bloc, consumer sentiment is rising, aiding the euro. The euro is represented by CurrencyShares Euro Trust (NYSEARCA: FXE ). In June, the consumer confidence figure came in at -5.6, unchanged from the previous month's revised reading of -5.6, while bettering estimates for -5.8. A reading below zero signals pessimism. Since bottoming at close to -30 in 2012, consumer sentiment has trended strongly higher, seen below. An improving labor market has aided sentiment, pushing household spending higher. That acceleration owed much to falling energy prices, which left households with more money to spend on goods and services produced within the currency area. Nevertheless, a sustained decline in consumer confidence as a result of a Greek departure from the currency area would threaten the recovery," according to the Wall Street Journal. A recovery in the labor market has manifested itself in rising wages. In the first quarter, the wage figure came in at an annual pace of 2.2%, above the previous quarter's revised reading of 1.1%. After consolidating the past few years, wages have now begun to accelerate higher in 2015, seen below. Rising wages and low inflation have created more purchasing power for consumers in the region. Finally, rising wages, low inflation, and increased sentiment are boosting spending. In April, the retail sales figure came in at an annual pace of 2.2%, above the previous month's revised reading of 1.7%, while also exceeding estimates for 2.0%. Since bottoming at close to -4.0% in 2012, consumer spending has significantly rebounded to current levels, seen below. Consumer spending has driven economic activity in the currency bloc in recent quarters. "The weaker euro hasn't proved a game changer for eurozone exporters, and trade was a drag on the economy in the first quarter. If household spending were to weaken, that would leave the recovery reliant on an increase in government spending and business investment. But the latter would also be hit by a Greek default and exit," according to the Wall Street Journal. More confident consumers are aiding the euro area's economy. Rising wages and low inflation are leading to increased purchasing power, boosting both household sentiment and spending measures. As economic activity further recovers, investor sentiment should rise as well, pushing the euro higher.
