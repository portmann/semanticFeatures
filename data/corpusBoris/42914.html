First-Quarter GDP – At A Glance - WSJ U.S. economic output expanded atÂ  a 0.2% seasonally adjusted annual rate Â in the early months of 2015, theÂ Commerce DepartmentÂ said Wednesday. Hereâ€™s a quick look at the report. A number of factors pulled overall first-quarter growth lower, including bad weather, a slowdown at West Coast ports, a stronger U.S. dollar, weak global demand and lower oil prices. The single biggest drag was falling exports of goods, which knocked 1.26 percentage points off GDP, the most since the first quarter of 2009. The second-biggest factor weighing on growth was a slowdown in business investment in new structures. Consumer Spending Slows Amid Severe Winter Weather U.S. consumer spending slowed in the first quarter, despite lower gas prices and strong job creation. Spending on goods inched up at a 0.2% rate, compared with 4.8% in the fourth quarter. Spending on services grew at a 2.8% pace, compared with the previous quarterâ€™s 4.3%. Spending on housing and utilities contributed 0.59 percentage point to the quarterâ€™s 0.2% growth rate, versus 0.24 percentage point in the prior GDP report. That was offset in part by lower spending on motor vehicles and groceries. Businesses slowed spending in the early months of the year, suggesting U.S. companies remain cautious amid weak global demand and the strengthening dollar. Business investmentâ€“which reflects spending on software, research and development, equipment and structuresâ€”shrank at a 3.4% rate, after growing at 4.7% in the fourth quarter and 8.9% in the third quarter. The dropoff reflected a slowdown in spending on new structures, driven primarily by the oil sector. Trade Weighs on First-Quarter Growth Foreign trade subtracted 1.25 percentage points from the first quarterâ€™s 0.2% GDP growth rate. Exports fell at a 7.2% annual pace during the quarter, down from the previous quarterâ€™s 4.5%, while imports slowed to 1.8%. Imports are a subtraction from the GDP calculation, so that dragged down broader growth, though not as much as the previous quarter. A stronger dollar makes U.S. exports more expensive and imports cheaper. Federal Reserve officials have been watching for signs of firming inflation as they weigh when to raise interest rates. They didnâ€™t get any reassurance from this morningâ€™s report, which showed overall prices fell 2%, the most since the first quarter of 2009. Prices excluding food and energy rose 0.9%, still well below the Fedâ€™s 2% inflation target. As the Fed wraps up its two-day policy meeting today, investors will be looking for clues on when the central bank will raise rates, though a rate increase before September seems increasingly unlikely.
