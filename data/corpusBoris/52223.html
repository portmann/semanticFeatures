Fifth Street Finance's Fiscal Q2 2015 NII And NAV Projection - Fifth Street Finance (NASDAQ:FSC) | Seeking Alpha Must Read  |  May.  6, 2015  6:30 AM ET  |  About: Fifth Street Finance (FSC) , Includes: KMPR by: Scott Kennedy Subscribers to SA PRO had an early look at this article. Learn more about PRO » I am projecting FSC will report a modest decrease in NAV during the fiscal second quarter of 2015 (NAV per share projection is stated within the article). Along with a new CEO comes an amended investment strategy focused on first lien senior secured floating-rate loans. It will take time for this strategy to be fully implemented. Even though I am projecting FSC will report another fairly weak quarter, I also believe most of the negative factors surrounding this company are already priced into the stock. For investors with a higher tolerance for risk and a long-term investment horizon, FSCâ€™s current stock price could be seen as an attractive entry point. Investors with a lower tolerance for risk should wait until FSC begins to show more definitive signs management is effectively executing on its newly amended investing strategy. Author's Note: This article provides a detailed analysis with supporting documentation on Fifth Street Finance Corp.'s (NASDAQ: FSC ) projected net asset value ("NAV") per share as of 3/31/2015. I perform this detailed analysis for readers who anticipate/want such an analysis performed each quarter. For readers who just want the summarized conclusions/results of the NAV projection analysis, I would suggest to scroll down to the "Conclusions Drawn" section near the bottom of the article. The focus of this article is to provide a detailed projection of FSC's NAV per share as of 3/31/2015. Prior to results being provided to the public before markets open on 5/11/2015 (via the company's quarterly press release), I would like to analyze FSC's NAV as of 3/31/2015 and provide readers a general direction on how I believe this recent quarter has panned out. I will also include my quarterly "net investment income" ("NII") and "net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations" (also known as "earnings per share" ("EPS")) projections in this article. Before we begin the company's NAV projection analysis, I wanted to provide readers my current thoughts in regards to FSC as a possible equity investment. This should help some readers better understand what is currently occurring within FSC regarding several key metrics and also assist when reading the NAV projection analysis. My current BUY, SELL, or HOLD recommendation for FSC will be at the bottom of this section of the article. I believe there are several positive and negative aspects to FSC right now. Let us first discuss a few positive factors. First, FSC had an annual forward yield to the company's stock price as of 5/1/2015 of 10.10%. This is one reason why investors are attracted to this stock and to the business development company ("BDC") sector in general. Some investors are looking for dividend income in this continued low interest rate environment. I believe FSC could be an enticing proposition for some investors looking for a monthly income stream while having a somewhat lower risk tolerance when compared to other high-yielding, more leveraged sectors. The new lower monthly dividend per share rate should have a greater probability of being maintained. This conclusion was provided in a recent BDC comparison article . For this reason, I believe some long-term investors could see the recent dividend cut as a potential positive factor once this reduction is behind the company. Second, I like the following aspects of FSC's business operations: 1) new executive management team including Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") Todd Owens who was an employee of Goldman Sachs & Co, for 24 years (partner in 2008); 2) expansion of offices across the U.S.; and 3) highest proportion of the investment portfolio within the healthcare services/technology sector. In addition, FSC has continued to "ramp up" loan syndications. As such, FSC has recently recognized minor net realized gains on syndicated loans that have appreciated in value. FSC has also been able to generate fee income from the transactions that should enhance overall yields on the company's investment portfolio. Third, FSC has recently formed a "joint venture" ("JV") partnership with a subsidiary of the Kemper Corp. (NYSE: KMPR ), Trinity Universal Insurance Company (Trinity). This recently formed JV partnership is called "Senior Loan Fund JV 1" (SLF JV 1). When SLF JV 1 is fully funded, management believes this investment will increase NII and generate higher rates of returns when compared to the rest of investment portfolio. This is due to the fact management fees are based on the net assets of SLF JV 1 (not gross assets) which is one strategic advantage. Management has continued to state SLF JV 1's internal rate of return ("IRR") remained steady in the mid-teens over the past two fiscal quarters. This includes the notion this specific JV had not reached its full operating capacity going into the fiscal second quarter of 2015. Using JV partnerships allows FSC to circumvent the BDC debt-to-equity leverage ratio threshold of 1.0x (including the notion of remaining a RIC per the IRC). In October 2014, it was announced FSC and Trinity agreed to double its combined equity commitment from $100 million to $200 million with the same proportional ownership. As such, FSC anticipated continuing to expand SLF JV 1 thus increasing this strategic advantage. As of 12/31/2014, SLF JV 1 had total investments of $265 million. Investments within SLF JV 1 include one-stop/unitranche and senior secured loans which should directly lead to strong returns for the fiscal second quarter of 2015. Furthermore, due to the benefits of this type of investment structure, FSC has stated the company is in active discussions with other third parties to create additional JV partnerships over the next several years. I believe these types of entities should be seen as a positive factor. Fourth, FSC has continued to reiterate the company does not anticipate issuing shares of common stock below CURRENT NAV for the foreseeable future. This notion has recently been confirmed when, on 3/18/2015, FSC held the company's 2015 Annual Meeting of Stockholders where there was no proposal for authorization to issue common stock at prices below NAV. I believe this is another positive factor (no dilution for existing shareholders over the foreseeable future). Fifth, the material decrease in the price of oil during FSC's fiscal first quarter of 2015 has caused "distress"/speculation to surround most of the oil and gas sector (including parts of the energy sector) regarding falling margins and potential struggling/bankrupt entities. While I would agree markets should have some sort of generalized "cause for concern" within the high-yield debt market, I also believe one needs to "drill down" to each BDC's debt and equity investments to see which portfolio companies could be affected by this event. As of 9/30/2014, FSC had 3.71% of the company's investment portfolio in the oil and gas sector (including certain investments in the energy sector which had "oil and gas" characteristics). As of 12/31/2014, only 1.77% of FSC's portfolio had debt and equity investments within the oil and gas sector. When compared to the nine other BDC peers I currently cover, this was one of the lower percentages at potential risk for investment depreciation. As of 12/31/2014, I calculated Apollo Investment Corp. (NASDAQ: AINV ), Main Street Capital Corp. (NYSE: MAIN ), Medley Capital Corp. (NYSE: MCC ), and Prospect Capital Corp. (NASDAQ: PSEC ) had an 18.61%, 6.39%, 6.81%, and 5.16% exposure to the oil and gas sector, respectively (again, including certain investments in the energy sector which had "oil and gas" characteristics). I believe FSC's recent low exposure to the oil and gas sector (percentage wise) should be seen as a positive factor. Now let us discuss several "cautionary"/negative factors. First, what was disappointing news to most investors (including myself) was the fact that FSC recorded material investment depreciation during the fiscal first quarter of 2015. This directly led to a material decrease in FSC's NAV as of 12/31/2014 when compared to 9/30/2014 ($9.17 per share versus $9.54 per share). Due to material depreciation within several of FSC's portfolio companies, management disclosed the company put four debt investments on "non-accrual" status during the fiscal first quarter of 2015. This directly led to less accrued interest and "payment-in-kind" ("PIK") income as recognized per Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"). I believe these specific portfolio companies, which include Transtrade Operators, Inc. (Transtrade), CCCG, LLC ("CCCG"), Phoenix Brands Merger Sub., LLC (Phoenix), and JTC Education, Inc. ("JTC"), experienced varying levels of investment depreciation during the fiscal second quarter of 2015. I believe this investment depreciation should be seen as a negative sign. Second, FSC's Board of Directors ("BoD") recently announced a material reduction to the company's monthly dividend per share rate. For the month of January 2015, FSC declared a dividend of $0.0917 per share. However, after declaring no monthly dividend for February 2015, FSC declared a monthly dividend rate of only $0.06 per share for the months of March - August 2015. As noted above, the new monthly dividend per share rate has a high probability of being maintained. However, even though FSC reported NII of $0.229 per share while reporting net investment company taxable income ("ICTI") of $0.239 per share for the fiscal first quarter of 2015, the company's BoD reduced dividends by (35%). In my professional opinion, this was an extremely cautious move. Yes, along with FSC's disappointing NII/net ICTI per share figures for the fiscal first quarter of 2015 grew the need to reduce the dividend. However, with that being said, I would have preferred to have seen a (10%) - (15%) dividend reduction with no special dividends versus a (35%) dividend reduction and the possibility of periodic special dividends. To get a better understanding of FSC's change in dividend policy, the following explanation was provided by Mr. Owens during FSC's earnings conference call for the fiscal first quarter of 2015 : "â€¦The decision to realign the dividend was driven by two things, the challenging operating environment and a broader change in our dividend policy. On the operating side we continue to execute on our initiatives to increase net investment income but the progress has been slower than expectedâ€¦On the policy side, as a newly installed management team at FSC, we believe that it's important to set our dividend at a level that is covered by our sustainable net investment income which should provide us a flexibility to make decisions that are in the best interest of our shareholders over the long term..." Simply put, I believe management assuming "sustainable net investment income" will be in the neighborhood of $0.18 per share should be seen as a cautionary/negative factor. In the future, I will continue to analyze FSC's results to see if the company's dividend per share rate can be sustained by matching distributions with NII and net ICTI. Third, prior to FSC's results for the fiscal first quarter of 2015, the company had a relatively stable annualized weighted average yield on its debt investments. FSC had an annualized weighted average yield on the company's debt investments of 12.0% as of 12/31/2012. This percentage decreased to only 11.1% as of 9/30/2014. When calculated, this was a weighted average yield decrease of only (0.9%) over the prior seven quarters. However, FSC's annualized weighted average yield on the company's debt investments was only 10.4% as of 12/31/2014. When calculated, this was a weighted average yield decrease of (0.7%) during the fiscal first quarter of 2015. For just one quarter, I believe this was a material decrease. Due to management's amended investment strategy focusing on a greater proportion of first lien senior secured floating-rate loans, I anticipate FSC's annualized weighted average yield on the company's debt investments to remain "flat" at best during the calendar year 2015. More likely, this yield percentage will slightly-modestly decrease as LIBOR continues to remain suppressed. I believe this should be seen as a cautionary factor. My BUY, SELL, or HOLD Recommendation: FSC recently closed at $7.13 per share as of 5/4/2015. This was a ($1.84) per share discount to my projected NAV of $8.97 per share as of 3/31/2015. This calculates to a price to NAV ratio of 0.7949 or a discount of (20.51%). From the analysis provided above, including additional factors not analyzed within this article, I currently rate FSC as a SELL when the company's stock price is trading at less than a material (less than 10%) discount to NAV as of 3/31/2015, a HOLD when trading at a material (at or greater than 10% but less than 15%) discount to NAV as of 3/31/2015, and a BUY when trading at or greater than an excessively material (at or greater than 15%) discount to NAV as of 3/31/2015. As such, I currently rate FSC as a BUY as I believe the company's current stock price reflects most (if not all) of the cautionary/negative factors associated with this company. For investors with a higher tolerance for risk and a long-term investment horizon, FSC's current stock price could be seen as an attractive entry point. However, investors with a lower tolerance for risk should wait until FSC begins to show more definitive signs management is effectively executing on its newly amended investing strategy. At the very least, these types of investors should wait until FSC reports the company's results for the fiscal second quarter of 2015 to see if certain debt and equity investments within its investment portfolio have stabilized operations. Each investor's BUY, SELL, or HOLD decision is based on one's risk tolerance, time horizon, and dividend income goals. My personal recommendation may not fit each investor's current investing strategy. Overview of FSC's Projected NAV as of 3/31/2015: Due to the fact that several figures needed to project/calculate FSC's NAV as of 3/31/2015 come directly from the company's consolidated statement of operations, I provide Table 1 below. Table 1 shows FSC's consolidated statement of operations from a six-months ended timeframe. Using Table 1 below as a reference, one must add certain account figures from the fiscal first and second quarter of 2015 for purposes of projecting a suitable NAV as of 3/31/2015. (Source: Table created entirely by myself, including all calculated figures and projected valuations) Having provided Table 1 above (in particular FSC's "Fiscal Six-Months Ended (ESTIMATE)" column), we can now begin to calculate FSC's projected NAV as of 3/31/2015. This projection will be calculated using Table 2 below. (Source: Table created entirely by myself, including all calculated figures and projected valuations) Using Table 2 above as a reference, let us take a look at the calculation for FSC's projected NAV as of 3/31/2015. Unless otherwise noted, all figures below are for the "six-months ended" timeframe. Let us look at the following figures (in corresponding order to the "Ref." column shown in Table 2 next to the March 31, 2015 column): Side Note: Predicting certain accounting figures within the BDC sector is usually more difficult when compared to other sectors due to the fair market value ("FMV") adjustments that occur on a company's investment portfolio each quarter. Specifically, the following two FSC accounts are typically more difficult to project in any given quarter: 1) unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments; and 2) realized gain (loss) on investments. As such, there are several assumptions used when performing such an analysis. FSC's actual reported values may differ materially from my projected values within this article due to unforeseen circumstances. This could occur because management deviates from a company's prior business strategy and pursues a new strategy that was not previously disclosed or anticipated. This could also occur when the company has a "one-time" extraordinary event which was previously unforeseen. Readers should be aware as such. All projections within this article are my personal estimates and should not solely be used for any investor's buying or selling decisions. All actual reported figures that are above my ranges within this article will be deemed a positive sign in my judgment. All actual reported figures that are below my ranges within this article will be deemed a negative sign in my judgment. - Confidence Within Range = Moderate to High - See Red Reference "A" in Table 2 Above Next to the March 31, 2015 Column This "net increase (decrease) in net assets from operations" figure consists of the following three amounts (excluding one additional account not discussed due to immateriality) that come directly from FSC's consolidated statement of operations: 1) net investment income (see blue reference "A" in Tables 1 and 2 above); 2) net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments (see blue reference "B" in Tables 1 and 2 above); and 3) net realized gain (loss) on investments (see blue reference "C" in Tables 1 and 2 above). Since I have refrained from writing a quarterly consolidated statement of operations projection article for FSC (due to time constraints), I will summarize what I believe occurred within these three amounts during the fiscal second quarter of 2015. Let us first discuss FSC's NII account. - Confidence Within Range = Moderate to High - See Blue Reference "A" in Tables 1 and 2 Above Next to the March 31, 2015 Column FSC reported NII of $35.2 million for the fiscal first quarter of 2015. I am projecting FSC will report NII of $33.4 million for the fiscal second quarter of 2015. Using Tables 1 and 2 above as a reference, when combined this is a projected NII of $68.6 million for the six-months ended 3/31/2015. During FSC's earnings call for the fiscal first quarter of 2015 (link provided earlier in the article), management stated the company had a very strong calendar fourth quarter of 2014 regarding loan originations. In fact, management stated most deals that were "in the pipeline" during the fiscal first quarter of 2015 were closed prior to 12/31/2014. As such, this led FSC having quarterly loan originations funded at close and add-on investments of $722 million during the fiscal first quarter of 2015. Since FSC was able to close most investments in the company's pipeline in the prior quarter, management stated its quarterly loan originations funded at close and add-on investments will be materially lower during the fiscal second quarter of 2015. As such, I am projecting FSC had quarterly loan originations funded at close and add-on investments of $225 million during the fiscal second quarter of 2015. As a result of FSC's continued strategy of rotating out of certain assets and taking advantage of deals when appropriate (including generalized trends in the BDC sector as a whole), I am projecting the company had portfolio sales/repayments/syndications of ($300) million during the fiscal second quarter of 2015. When combining the company's quarterly gross loan originations funded at close and add-on investments less portfolio sales/repayments/syndications, I am projecting FSC's total investment portfolio decreased by approximately ($75) million for the fiscal second quarter of 2015 (prior to all quarterly FMV fluctuations and scheduled principle payments). As such, I am projecting FSC had a minor decrease to the company's net investments. The projected minor decrease in quarterly NII ($33.4 million for the fiscal second quarter of 2015 versus $35.2 million for the fiscal first quarter of 2015) is mainly attributed to a modest decrease in fee income offset by slight decreases in base management fees and incentive fees. Now let us discuss FSC's net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments account. 2) Net Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments: - Confidence Within Range = Moderate - See Blue Reference "B" in Tables 1 and 2 Above Next to the March 31, 2015 Column FSC reported a net unrealized depreciation on investments of ($48.6) million for the fiscal first quarter of 2015. I am projecting FSC will report a net unrealized depreciation on investments of ($38.1) million for the fiscal second quarter of 2015. Using Tables 1 and 2 above as a reference, when combined this is a projected net unrealized depreciation on investments of ($86.7) million for the six-months ended 3/31/2015. In the prior quarter, the following material valuation changes occurred within this account: 1) unrealized depreciation of ($4.5) million on Transtrade; 2) unrealized depreciation of ($5.9) million on HFG Holdings, LLC ("HFG"); 3) unrealized appreciation of $1.6 million on First Star Aviation, LLC (First Star); 4) unrealized appreciation of $1.6 million on First Star Speir Aviation 1 Limited (First Star Speir); 5) unrealized depreciation of ($10.2) million on Phoenix; 6) unrealized depreciation of ($12.2) million on CCCG; and 7) unrealized depreciation of ($10.0) million on Edmentum, Inc. (Edmentum). The remaining net change to this account consisted of numerous minor unrealized FMV fluctuations within the rest of FSC's investment portfolio. To provide further clarity in regards to this account projection, I am including an additional analysis within this quarterly projection article. To provide readers with FSC's FMV and cost investment rating analysis, Table 3 is provided below. Table 3 highlights specific portfolio companies who have had FMV write-downs in the past and who are currently susceptible to further FMV write-downs over the next several fiscal quarters. Since FMV write-downs are one of the main determinants of whether to put a debt investment on non-accrual status (ceasing to recognize interest income on a particular loan), this analysis has a direct impact on FSC's NII. Furthermore, FMV write-downs (whether unrealized or realized) directly affect FSC's EPS in the quarter of occurrence (in particular, the account that is currently being projected). I believe this analysis will bring some added clarity to readers to better understand how FSC's investment portfolio was rated, regarding investment valuations, as of 9/30/2014 and 12/31/2014. (Source: Table created entirely by myself, partially using FSC data obtained from the SEC's EDGAR Database ) Using Table 3 above as a reference, I classify FSC's debt and equity investments within one of the following three portfolios: 1) control (dark blue coloring); 2) affiliate (olive green coloring); or 3) non-control/affiliate (purple coloring). Within these three classifications, five different "investment ratings" are shown based on each portfolio's recent cost basis and FMV. I include each portfolio's cost basis to better highlight past FMV unrealized appreciation (depreciation) within each classification. An investment rating of "1" describes the portion of FSC's debt and equity investments that were performing at or above expectations. An investment rating of "2" describes the portion of investments that were performing near expectations. An investment rating of "3" describes the portion of investments that were performing slightly below expectations. An investment rating of "4" describes the portion of investments that were performing modestly below expectations. Finally, an investment rating of "5" describes the portion of investments that were performing materially below expectations. For purposes of this article, let us focus on the figures classified with an investment rating of 5 as of 9/30/2014 and 12/31/2014. Investment Rating 5 (Performing Materially Below Expectations): I have classified 1% and 2% of FSC's investment portfolio performing materially below expectations as of 9/30/2014 and 12/31/2014 (based on FMV). All debt investments within this classification should be on non-accrual status (unless there is a specific reason otherwise). Also, certain debt and equity investments within this classification have a moderate to high probability of a partial non-recovery of one's remaining principal/cost basis (including a possible total write-off). Readers should understand a non-accrual would bring the risk of a slight decrease in interest income per GAAP and the risk of further decreases in NAV from future FMV write-offs. As of 9/30/2014, this investment rating had a cost basis of $50.0 million while having a FMV of $20.9 million. As of 12/31/2014, this investment rating had a cost basis of $122.2 million while having a FMV of $63.1 million. When calculated, this analysis shows FSC's investment portfolio had an increased FMV balance of $42.2 million regarding the company's debt and equity investments performing materially below expectations. It is never a positive sign when a company has any part of its investment portfolio within this rating classification. From a FMV perspective, the monetary amount of FSC's investments with a rating classification of 5 materially increased during the fiscal first quarter of 2015. Hypothetically speaking, if all the debt and equity investments within this classification eventually were deemed worthless (FMV of $0), this would currently decrease FSC's NAV by ($0.41) per share. Simply put, this analysis shows 5% of FSC's investment portfolio showed signs of slight, moderate, or material underperformance. I believe the debt and equity investments within these portfolio companies should continue to be monitored to a greater degree as they are the most susceptible to continued FMV write-downs, non-performance (which would lead to non-accruals), and ultimately a probable partial (in some cases total) loss of principal/cost basis. This would negatively impact FSC's future NII and EPS. When compared to the calculated percentage from the prior quarter (3%), I believe FSC's investment portfolio, from a valuation standpoint, appeared to be modestly less attractive. Regarding the fiscal second quarter of 2015, I am projecting the following material valuation changes occurred within this account: 1) unrealized depreciation of ($4.0) million on TransTrade; 2) unrealized depreciation of ($5.0) million on Phoenix; 3) unrealized depreciation of ($8.0) million on CCCG; 4) unrealized depreciation of ($6.8) million on Edmentum; and 5) unrealized depreciations of ($6.5) million on Integrated Petroleum Technologies, Inc. ("IPT"). Several of FSC's control investments dealing with airlines (aircraft leasing) should experience minor - modest FMV appreciation. I am projecting the remaining net change to this account consisted of numerous minor - modest unrealized FMV fluctuations on the rest of FSC's investment portfolio. This account's projection is formed from a detailed investment portfolio model that will be omitted from this article due to the sheer size of the data. Now let us discuss FSC's net realized gain (loss) on investments account. 3) Net Realized Gain (Loss) on Investments: - Confidence Within Range = Moderate - See Blue Reference "C" in Tables 1 and 2 Above Next to the March 31, 2015 Column FSC reported a net realized loss on investments of ($17.6) million for the fiscal first quarter of 2015. I am projecting FSC will report a net realized loss on investments of ($2.5) million for the fiscal second quarter of 2015. Using Tables 1 and 2 above as a reference, when combined this is a projected net realized loss on investments of ($20.1) million for the six-months ended 3/31/2015. During the prior quarter, FSC recorded a realized loss of ($17.9) million in regards to the company's restructuring of Miche Bag, LLC (now called Miche Group LLC). As part of this restructuring, FSC took a controlling interest in the newly formed entity. It should be noted FSC had a cost basis of $5.8 million in Miche Group LLC as of 12/31/2014. FSC also recorded a realized gain of $0.3 million in regards to the company's sales of debt investments in the open market during the fiscal first quarter of 2015. Regarding the fiscal second quarter of 2015, I am projecting a modest net loss from the sale of a portfolio company partially offset by a minor realized gain in regards to the company's open markets sales. Let us now combine the three amounts described above (including one additional account not discussed due to immateriality) to come up with a proper net increase (decrease) in net assets from operations figure for the six-months ended 3/31/2015. When combining NII of $68.6 million, a net unrealized depreciation on investments of ($86.7) million, a net unrealized depreciation on secured borrowings of $0.5 million, and a net realized loss on investments of ($20.1) million, I am projecting FSC had a decrease in net assets from operations of ($37.7) million for the six-months ended 3/31/2015 (see red reference "A" in Table 2 above). - See Red Reference "B" and Blue Reference "D" in Table 2 Above Next to the March 31, 2015 Column - See Blue Reference "D" in Table 4 Below Side Note: As shown in Table 2 above, FSC's "net increase (decrease) in net assets from stockholder transactions" figure is the equivalent to the company's "distributions to stockholders from net ICTI" figure. Since this is the only amount within this specific classification, both figures will be the same. This is a fairly simple calculation. This is FSC's dividend distributions for the fiscal first and second quarters of 2015. (Source: Table created entirely by myself, partially using FSC data obtained from the SEC's EDGAR Database [link provided below Table 3]) Using Table 4 above as a reference, the number of outstanding shares of common stock as of 1/13/2015 is projected to be 153.3 million. This figure is unchanged from FSC's outstanding shares of common stock as of 12/31/2014. The monthly common stock dividend for the month of January 2015 was $0.0917 per share. When calculated, I am projecting January 2015 dividend distributions of ($14.1) million. Still using Table 4 as a reference, the number of outstanding shares of common stock as of 3/12/2015 is projected to be 153.3 million. This figure is unchanged from FSC's outstanding shares of common stock as of 1/13/2015. The monthly common stock dividend for the month of March 2015 was $0.06 per share. When calculated, I am projecting March 2015 dividend distributions of ($9.2) million. When these two monthly dividend distributions are combined with the three-months ended dividend distributions of ($42.2) million, I am projecting FSC had a decrease in net assets from stockholder transactions of ($65.4) million (rounded) for the six-months ended 3/31/2015 (see red reference "B" in Table 2 above and blue reference "D" in Tables 2 and 4 above). - See Red Reference "C" in Table 2 Above Next to the March 31, 2015 Column This "net increase (decrease) in net assets from capital share transactions" figure consists of the following three amounts: 1) issuance of common stock, net (see blue reference "E" in Table 2 above and Table 5 below); 2) issuance of common stock under dividend reinvestment plan (see blue reference "F" in Table 2 above and Table 6 below); and 3) repurchases of common stock. - See Blue Reference "E" in Table 2 Above Next to the March 31, 2015 Column - See Blue Reference "E" in Table 5 Below This is FSC's issuance of common stock, net of underwriting fees and offering costs for the fiscal first and second quarters of 2015. Since FSC did not have any equity offerings (which would result in the issuance of common stock) during the fiscal second quarter of 2015, this figure should remain at $0 for the six-months ended 3/31/2015 (see blue reference "E" in Table 2 above and Table 5 below). (Source: Table created entirely by myself, partially using FSC data obtained from the SEC's EDGAR Database [link provided below Table 3]) 2) Issuance of Common Stock Under Dividend Reinvestment Plan: - See Blue Reference "F" in Table 2 Above Next to the March 31, 2015 Column - See Blue Reference "F" in Table 6 Below This is FSC's issuance of common stock under the company's dividend reinvestment plan for the fiscal first and second quarters of 2015. (Source: Table created entirely by myself, partially using FSC data obtained from the SEC's EDGAR Database [link provided below Table 3]) I am assuming management repurchased outstanding shares of common stock in the open market for the months of January and March 2015. This is due to the fact FSC's stock price, at the time of dividend distributions, was materially below the company's NAV of $9.17 per share as of 12/31/2014. Therefore, when this figure is combined with the three-months ended figure of $0, I am projecting FSC will report an issuance of common stock under the company's dividend reinvestment plan figure of $0 for the six-months ended 3/31/2015 (see blue reference "F" in Tables 2 and 6 above). - See Table 2 Above Next to the March 31, 2015 Column for Reference Management may intend to repurchase outstanding shares of common stock when FSC's stock price is at a material discount to the company's NAV. Even though during the fiscal second quarter of 2015 FSC's stock price continued to trade below the company's NAV of $9.17 per share as of 12/31/2014, I am assuming management did not initiate any share buybacks. I believe management wanted to put any unused capital towards quarterly loan originations, add-on investments, and/or a reduction of FSC's credit facilities. FSC also needs to consider certain RIC leverage ratio thresholds to remain in compliance with the IRC. Therefore, I am projecting FSC will report a repurchases of common stock figure of $0 for the six-months ended 3/31/2015 (see Table 2 above). When combining net equity proceeds in common stock issuances of $0, net equity proceeds in relation to the company's dividend reinvestment plan of $0, and repurchases of common stock of $0, I am projecting FSC had no change in net assets from capital share transactions for the six-months ended 3/31/2015 (see red reference "C" in Table 2 above). To sum up all the information discussed above, I am projecting FSC will report the following NAV per share as of 3/31/2015: FSC's Projected NAV as of 3/31/2015 = $8.97 Per Share FSC's Projected NAV Range as of 3/31/2015 = $8.82 - $9.12 Per Share This projection is a decrease of ($0.20) per share from FSC's NAV as of 12/31/2014. This modest decrease in NAV can be attributed to the following quarterly per share changes: (Source: Table created entirely by myself, including all calculated figures and projected valuations) Using Table 7 above as a reference, I am projecting FSC's net increase in net assets resulting from operations (also known as EPS) will be ($0.05) per share for the fiscal second quarter of 2015 (rounded to the nearest cent). In comparison, I am projecting FSC had dividend distributions of ($0.15) per share for the fiscal second quarter of 2015 (also rounded to the nearest cent). After adding these two amounts together, a decrease of ($0.20) per share for the fiscal second quarter of 2015 is obtained. Again, the main reason for the projected modest decrease in NAV is in relation to material investment depreciation within several of FSC's portfolio companies (proportionately speaking) during the fiscal second quarter of 2015.
