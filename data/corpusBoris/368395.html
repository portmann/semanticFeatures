UPDATE 2-Bank of Canada holds rates, govt steps offset weakness elsewhere | Reuters OTTAWA, April 13 The Bank of Canada kept interest rates steady on Wednesday, saying weaker global growth, a less favorable U.S. outlook and shrinking business investment would have driven the economic outlook lower if not for the boost from the government's fiscal stimulus. Citing the spending announced in the new Liberal government's March budget as one of the only positive factors driving economic growth in Canada amid a prolonged slump in the energy sector, the central bank took a dovish tone in its closely watched quarterly Monetary Policy Report even as it raised forecasts for growth in 2016. As expected, it held its overnight rate at 0.5 percent, where it has been since July 2015, saying risks to the inflation profile are roughly balanced. The bank said the output gap could close earlier than it had anticipated in January, likely in the second half of 2017 rather than at the end of 2017, as the fiscal stimulus - which includes infrastructure investment and new child benefits for many households - boosts growth and potential output is revised lower. The bank said that while the U.S. economy, Canada's largest trading partner, would regain momentum after weakness early in 2016, the recovery's profile and composition would be "less favorable for Canadian exports," while global growth would be weaker than earlier projected. "I thought across the board they were still counseling caution. They accentuated almost every negative they could," said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets. The Canadian dollar firmed against the greenback immediately after the statement but later weakened. The recent strengthening of the Canadian dollar was also weighing on exports, the bank said, dismissing unexpectedly strong economic growth in the first quarter as temporary strength that is likely to reverse in the second quarter. "The combined effect of all these global and domestic developments would have been a modest downgrade of the Bank's outlook. However, the fiscal measures announced in the March federal budget will have a notable positive impact on GDP," the bank said. The fiscal spending will boost GDP growth by 0.5 percentage point in 2016 and 0.6 percentage point in 2017, the Bank said. The fiscal boost will drive overall economic growth to 1.7 percent in 2016 and 2.3 percent in 2017, the  bank said. In January, it had forecast 2016 growth at 1.4 percent. It forecast growth would dip to 2.0 percent in 2018.   (Additional reporting by Matt Scuffham in Toronto; Editing by Jonathan Oatis) Join the world's leading health experts and the Harvard T. H.
