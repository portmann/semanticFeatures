Vince Holding Corp.: A Chicken With Its Head Cut Off - Vince Holding Corp. (NYSE:VNCE) | Seeking Alpha It is now a declining revenue and declining margin story. Vince Holding Corp. (NYSE: VNCE ) is a contemporary fashion brand known for modern effortless style and everyday luxury essentials. It offers a wide range of women's, men's and children's apparel, women's and men's footwear, and handbags. The company operates its business through two segments: wholesale and direct-to-consumer. The wholesale segment is comprised of sales to premier department stores and specialty stores in the U.S. and in select international markets. The direct-to-consumer segment includes its retail and outlet stores and its e-commerce business. Actually the only segment you should worry about is the wholesale business because it was over 80% of VNCE's operating income - and this segment is contracting as customers are reducing their upfront buys in order to better manage inventory. At least that's the party line. Who knows what the real story is, now that the CFO resigned in June and the CEO resigned in July. What a disaster. Bulls argue that VNCE is a buy because, well, how can things get worse? The stock is down 75%, right? People who buy stocks because it is down a lot should consult this wonderful list of bankrupt companies. Always keep in mind that the downside from any price is 100%. VNCE's real problem is that it is a busted growth story. It grew at 25% revenue CAGR over three years with declining margins, but now that the growth entirely stopped, margins are expected to continue to contract - very significantly. When a growth stock turns into a no-growth, contracting margin stock, the past stock price becomes meaningless. And when the CEO and CFO both resigned back to back, that usually means the can of worms is just starting to open. And at $9/share, I'm still not seeing any senior management buying. Knowingly stepping into a disaster to be a contrarian is just playing the optionality of a failed stock. Roll the dice and pray. VNCE is currently trading at $9.06 per share, a market value of $333 million, and an enterprise value of $421 million. The stock's current dividend yield is 0.0%, -202 bps below the dividend yield for the S&P 500. The stock performed very poorly over the past year, returning -7,666 basis points relative to the S&P 500, or -75.1% in absolute return. VNCE's revenue grew by a CAGR of 24.8% over the past 3 full fiscal years. Analysts' consensus is forecasting revenues to grow 0.2% this fiscal year, reaching $341 million and by 8.6% the following fiscal year, reaching $370 million. Over the past three full fiscal years, VNCE's EBIT margin decreased by 382 basis points from 24.2% to 20.4%. Analysts' consensus is forecasting EBIT margin to contract by 313 basis points this fiscal year to 17.3%, and contract by 17 basis points the following fiscal year to 17.1%. Over the past 3 years, management increased its diluted outstanding common shares by 44.9%. Going forward, consensus is forecasting EPS to decrease by -9.2% reaching $0.84 this fiscal year and to increase by 10.0% reaching $0.93 the following fiscal year. How these analysts gain the confidence for a FY2 (next fiscal year) bounce, I have no idea. With net debt of $88 million, VNCE is 1.3 times levered to its trailing 12-month EBITDA of $77 million. So at least its debt level isn't a disaster. Using consensus estimates for next fiscal year's results, VNCE is currently trading at an EV/sales multiple of 1.1, an EV/EBIT multiple of 6.7, a P/E multiple of 9.8, and an FCF multiple of 20.6. Relative to the S&P 500, VNCE is trading at EV/sales discount of 30.5%, an EV/EBIT discount of 49.5%, P/E discount of 35.2%, and FCF premium of 16.3%. VNCE's PEG ratio is currently 0.9 compared to the S&P 500's PEG ratio of 1.4 - this is a discount of -37.4%. I don't know how to value VNCE because the FY2 forecasts are completely useless right now given that VNCE doesn't have a permanent CEO or CFO. But notice how little FCF VNCE has, and it is still trading at a 16% premium to the S&P 500. You can't eat EPS; it's FCF that fills the belly and the bank account.
