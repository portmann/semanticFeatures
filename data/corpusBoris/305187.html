Fourth-Quarter U.S. Growth – The Numbers - WSJ The U.S. economy had an ugly fourth quarter . Chalk it up to weak exports, a drop in inventories and a decline in business spending. Here are some key numbers from the Commerce Departmentâ€™s report. Growth in gross domestic product during the fourth quarter, at a seasonally adjusted annual rate. The U.S. economy lost momentum from October through December, with growth slowing from the third quarterâ€™s 2% rate and the second quarterâ€™s 3.9% pace. Economists had expected the economy to grow at a 0.8% pace in the final quarter of 2015. Growth in gross domestic product for all of 2015 compared with all of 2014. Even with the fourth-quarter slowdown, the U.S. economy matched 2014 as the second-strongest year of growth in the six full calendar years since the recession. Over that stretch, economic growth has averaged 2.1% per calendar year. Real final sales of domestic product. The amount of American goods and services sold, rather than made, in the U.S. and abroad rose 1.2% in the fourth quarter from the third quarter. That figure suggests underlying demand for American products weakened amid global economic woes. Final salesâ€”which strip out the effect of inventory buildupâ€”grew 2.7% in the third quarter and 3.9% in the second quarter. Final sales are often a better gauge of the economyâ€™s underlying health than the headline GDP figure, which measures everything produced, even the stuff that sat on stockroom shelves. Decline in spending on mining, shafts and wells for all of 2015. A sharp decline in business investment tied to energy-industry woes weighed on economic growth last year. The drop in spending on mining was the steepest since 1986. Growth in consumer spending for all of 2015. Consumers carried the economy last year, boosting spending at the quickest pace since 2005. • You must enter the verification code below to send.
