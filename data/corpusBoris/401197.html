Prospect Capital Corp.'s Fiscal Q3 2016 NII And NAV Projection - Prospect Capital Corporation (NASDAQ:PSEC) | Seeking Alpha I am projecting PSEC will report a minor (less than 2%) decrease in NAV during the fiscal third quarter of 2016. This projected decrease is mainly due to net depreciation within PSECâ€™s CLO portfolio and certain oil and gas investments, partially offset by net appreciation on several specific control investments. However, when compared to the prior quarter, I am projecting more upbeat earnings due to the fact that after a notable widening of spreads to start 2016, spreads have recently tightened. I am also projecting PSEC will generate a minor economic return for the quarter. My buy, sell or hold recommendation and current price target for PSEC are stated in the â€œConclusions Drawnâ€? section of the article. The focus of this article is to provide a detailed projection of Prospect Capital Corp.'s (NASDAQ: PSEC ) net asset value ("NAV") per share as of 3/31/2016. Prior to results being provided to the public on 5/10/2016 (via the company's quarterly press release), I would like to analyze PSEC's NAV as of 3/31/2016 and provide readers a general direction on how I believe this recent quarter has panned out. I believe this quarter has a heightened level of importance to readers due to the recent events that have impacted the business development company ("BDC") sector. This includes, but is not limited to, the Federal Open Market Committee's ("FOMC") decision regarding monetary policy, the 2015-2016 net decrease in crude oil prices, and the continued volatility within the high yield debt market as spreads first materially widened but have recently tightened. I will also include my quarterly "net investment income" ("NII") and "earnings per share" ("EPS") (also known as "net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations") projections in this article. My BUY, SELL, or HOLD recommendation and current price target for PSEC will be in the "Conclusions Drawn" section of this article. Side Note: Predicting certain accounting figures within the BDC sector is usually more difficult when compared to other sectors due to the fair market value ("FMV") fluctuations that occur within a company's investment portfolio each quarter. Specifically, the following two PSEC accounts are typically more difficult to project in any given quarter: 1) unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments; and 2) realized gain (loss) on investments. As such, there are several assumptions used when performing such an analysis. PSEC's actual reported values may differ materially from my projected values within this article due to unforeseen circumstances. This could occur because management deviates from a company's prior business strategy and pursues a new strategy that was not previously disclosed or anticipated. This could also occur when the company has a "one-time" extraordinary event which was previously unforeseen or disclosed. Readers should be aware as such. All projections within this article are my personal estimates and should not solely be used for any investor's buying or selling decisions. All actual reported figures that are above the mean of my account projections will be deemed an "outperformance" in my judgment. All actual reported figures that are below the mean of my account projections will be deemed an "underperformance" in my judgment. Overview of PSEC's NAV as of 3/31/2016: Due to the fact that several figures needed to project/calculate PSEC's NAV as of 3/31/2016 come directly from the company's consolidated statement of operations, I provide Table 1 below. Table 1 shows PSEC's consolidated statement of operations from a nine-month ended time frame. Using Table 1 below as a reference, one must calculate certain account figures from the fiscal first, second and third quarters of 2016 for purposes of projecting a suitable NAV as of 3/31/2016. (Source: Table created entirely by myself, including all calculated figures and projected valuations) Having provided Table 1 above (in particular PSEC's "Fiscal Nine-Months Ended (ESTIMATE)" column), we can now begin to calculate PSEC's projected NAV as of 3/31/2016. This projection will be calculated using Table 2 below. (Source: Table created entirely by myself, including all calculated figures and projected valuations. All figures, with the exception of the number of outstanding shares of common stock and NAV per share figures, are in 000s) Using Table 2 above as a reference, let us take a look at the calculation for PSEC's projected NAV as of 3/31/2016. Unless otherwise noted, all figures below are for the "nine-months ended" time frame. Let us look at the following figures (in corresponding order to the "Ref." column shown in Table 2 next to the March 31, 2016, column): - Confidence Within Range = Moderate to High - See Red Reference "A" in Table 2 Above Next to the March 31, 2016, Column This "net increase (decrease) in net assets from operations" figure consists of the following three amounts that come directly from PSEC's consolidated statement of operations: 1) net investment income (see blue reference "A" in Tables 1 and 2 above); 2) net realized gain (loss) on investments (see blue reference "B" in Tables 1 and 2 above); and 3) net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments (see blue reference "C" in Tables 1 and 2 above). It should be noted a fourth amount, PSEC's gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt, is also included but is deemed "immaterial" for discussion purposes. Since I have refrained from writing a quarterly consolidated statement of operations projection article for PSEC (due to time constraints), I will summarize what I believe will occur within these three amounts during the fiscal third quarter of 2016. Let us first discuss PSEC's NII account. - See Blue Reference "A" in Tables 1 and 2 Above Next to the March 31, 2016, Column PSEC reported NII of $91.2 and $100.9 million for the fiscal first and second quarters of 2016, respectively. I am projecting PSEC will report NII of $87.3 million for the fiscal third quarter of 2016. Using Tables 1 and 2 above as a reference, when combined this is a projected NII of $279.4 million for the nine months ended 3/31/2016. Middle market ("MM") and upper middle market ("UMM") lending, as a whole, witnessed subdued levels of loan originations over the past several quarters. This trend continued to persist during PSEC's fiscal third quarter of 2016. In fact, loan origination volumes across financial markets were either at or near multi-year lows at the beginning of calendar year 2016 mainly due to heightened volatility in U.S. and global credit markets. Per PSEC's Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") filings , it would also appear the company had "below average" loan originations and add-on investments during the fiscal third quarter of 2016. Management disclosed PSEC had approximately $10 million of loan originations and add-on investments during the quarter. While I am assuming other, previously "non-disclosed" add-on investments also occurred during the quarter, I am still projecting PSEC's total loan originations and add-on investments during the fiscal third quarter of 2016 were well below average. This will likely negatively impact PSEC's total investment income for the quarter. Management also disclosed PSEC had portfolio sales/repayments/restructurings (that were "publicly" disclosed) of approximately ($100) million during the fiscal third quarter of 2016. This figure is also a notable decrease when compared to most quarters. When combining the company's quarterly loan originations funded at close and add-on investments less portfolio sales/repayments/restructurings, I am projecting PSEC's total investment portfolio decreased ($25)-($75) million for the fiscal third quarter of 2016 (prior to all quarterly FMV fluctuations and scheduled principle payments). The projected modest decrease in quarterly NII ($87.3 million for the fiscal third quarter of 2016 versus $100.9 million for the fiscal second quarter of 2016) is mainly attributed to the following factors when compared to the prior quarter: 1) recent debt-to-equity restructuring of Freedom Marine Solutions, LLC (Freedom); 2) minor decrease in "collateralized loan obligation" ("CLO") accrued interest income; 3) recent non-accrual of several smaller debt investments; and 4) minor decrease in the company's total expenses. Now let us discuss PSEC's net realized gain (loss) on investments account. 2) Net Realized Gain (Loss) on Investments: - See Blue Reference "B" in Tables 1 and 2 Above Next to the March 31, 2016, Column PSEC reported a net realized loss on investments of ($2.1) and ($5.3) million for the fiscal first and second quarters of 2016, respectively. I am projecting PSEC will report a net realized gain on investments of $3.0 million for the fiscal third quarter of 2016. Using Tables 1 and 2 above as a reference, when combined this is a projected net realized loss on investments of ($4.5) million (rounded) for the nine months ended 3/31/2016. I am projecting a minor net realized gain within this account during the fiscal third quarter of 2016 for one main reason. Management disclosed PSEC sold the company's investment in CIFC Funding 2011-I, Ltd. (CIFC 2011-I) during the quarter for a minor net realized gain. Further discussion of this account is unwarranted. Now let us discuss PSEC's net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments account. 3) Net Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments: - See Blue Reference "C" in Tables 1 and 2 Above Next to the March 31, 2016, Column PSEC reported net unrealized depreciation on investments of ($61.3) and ($190.6) million for the fiscal first and second quarters of 2016, respectively. I am projecting PSEC will report net unrealized depreciation on investments of ($52.5) million for the fiscal third quarter of 2016. Using Tables 1 and 2 above as a reference, when combined this is a projected net unrealized depreciation on investments of ($304.4) million for the nine months ended 3/31/2016. This account takes into consideration the quarterly FMV fluctuations that occur within PSEC's investment portfolio. I believe two key trends that occurred during the fiscal third quarter of 2016 should be discussed. First, during PSEC's fiscal third quarter of 2016, U.S. and global credit markets continued to experience heightened volatility. In part, towards the end of last year, markets anticipated the FOMC would finally increase the Federal ("Fed") Funds Rate for the first time in roughly a decade which directly impacts most short-term funding rates, including the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). This heightened volatility caused varying levels of underperformance within residential/commercial mortgages, corporate bonds and the high yield debt market. As such, spreads materially widened during PSEC's fiscal second quarter of 2016. Directly due to the increase in short-term rates in December 2015, most market participants were expecting U.S. interest rates to net increase during 2016, either at a steady or rapid pace. However, U.S. and global markets experienced a rapid, material "reversal" of rates back to or near multi-year lows (in some cases historical lows) amid fears of a global recession. This panic was apparent during January 2016 through the first-half of February 2016. While guaranteed fixed-income prices (for instance agency mortgage-backed securities ["MBS"] and certain AAA government bonds and institutional debt) were positively impacted by this event (general "rush to safety"), many other types of investments/fixed-income sectors saw spreads/yields materially widen/increase which, in turn, drove down prices. The high-yield debt market was no exception. However, it should also be noted this bearish trend "reversed course" during the second half of February 2016, March 2016, and most recently April 2016 as spreads/yields tightened/decreased which, in turn, drove prices back up. I believe the intra-quarter "price swing" within the MM and UMM should, at the very least, be mentioned as this has a direct impact on PSEC's (and the sector's) investment valuations. When compared to the MM, UMM and syndicated loan market, CLO pricing remained under pressure throughout PSEC's fiscal third quarter of 2016. However, consistent with the trend discussed above regarding the high yield debt market, CLO pricing by the end of the quarter "rebounded" from lows seen during February 2016 (just to a lesser extent). As such, while I certainly do not expect PSEC's CLO portfolio to record the same amount of investment depreciation that occurred during the prior quarter, I still believe net depreciation occurred within this portfolio during the company's fiscal third quarter of 2016 (especially newer vintages). Further discussion of the factors involved in valuing PSEC's CLO portfolio was provided in the following prior article: Prospect Capital Corp.'s Results for Fiscal Q2 2016 - My Assessment Second, consistent with price movements seen within the high yield debt market discussed earlier, crude oil prices continued to rapidly decrease during the first half of PSEC's fiscal third quarter of 2016. Even though the price of crude oil has recently rebounded from lows seen earlier in the year, the prolonged decrease in overall prices over an extended period of time has begun to cause some companies in the oil and gas sector to declare bankruptcy and/or restructure one's debt/capital structure. This increases the amount of "charge-offs," reserves and/or non-accruals within the financial sector regarding these types of investments (including the BDC sector). I believe this trend negatively impacted investment valuations within most BDCs' oil and gas portfolio companies. This net depreciation mainly stems from the decrease in the future projected cash flows of these specific investments due to heightened credit risk. The possibility of underperforming/non-performing investments within the oil and gas sector is likely to persist over the next several quarters. As of 12/31/2015, when excluding CLO investments, 3.28% of PSEC's portfolio had debt and equity investments within the oil and gas sector (including certain investments in the energy sector which had "oil and gas" characteristics). When including CLO investments (with confirmation by management), 3.96% of PSEC's portfolio had debt and equity investments within the oil and gas sector. While PSEC had an oil and gas exposure slightly below the average of the eleven BDC stocks I currently cover, I still believe the company had a modest exposure as of 12/31/2015. I calculated American Capital Senior Floating Ltd. (NASDAQ: ACSF ), Apollo Investment Corp. (NASDAQ: AINV ), Ares Capital Corp. (NASDAQ: ARCC ), Fifth Street Finance Corp. (NASDAQ: FSC ), Fifth Street Senior Floating Rate Corp. (NASDAQ: FSFR ), Golub Capital BDC Inc. (NASDAQ: GBDC ), Main Street Capital Corp. (NYSE: MAIN ), Medley Capital Corp. (NYSE: MCC ), Newtek Business Services Corp. (NASDAQ: NEWT ) and Solar Capital, Ltd. (NASDAQ: SLRC ) had a 1.09%, 12.89%, 2.92%, 1.68%, 0.68%, 0.08%, 4.75%, 5.14%, 0.00% and 0.00% exposure to the oil and gas sector as of 12/31/2015, respectively (including certain investments in the energy sector which had oil and gas characteristics). Regarding my projected net unrealized depreciation on investments figure for the fiscal third quarter of 2016, this amount includes FMV depreciation within PSEC's CLO portfolio (discussed above) and several of the company's oil and gas control investments including (but not limited to) Arctic Energy Services, LLC (Arctic Energy), CP Energy Services Inc. (CP Energy), Freedom, and Gulf Coast Machine and Supply Company (Gulf Coast). However, I am also projecting several of PSEC's control investments had FMV "write-ups" during this quarter thus offsetting a portion of the projected unrealized depreciation. Specifically, I project some strength in PSEC's consumer finance and aerospace investments. This account's projection is formed from a detailed investment portfolio model that will be omitted from this article due to the sheer size of the tabulated data. Let us now combine the three amounts described above (including one additional account not discussed due to immateriality) to come up with a projected net increase (decrease) in net assets from operations figure for the nine months ended 3/31/2016. When combining NII of $279.4 million, a net loss on the extinguishment of debt of ($0.1) million, a net realized loss on investments of ($4.5) million, and net unrealized depreciation on investments of ($304.4) million, I am projecting PSEC had a decrease in net assets from operations of ($29.5) million (rounded) for the nine months ended 3/31/2016 (see red reference "A" in Table 2 above). - See Red Reference "B" and Blue Reference "D" in Table 2 Above Next to the March 31, 2016, Column - See Blue Reference "D" in Table 3 Below Side Note: As shown in Table 2 above, PSEC's "net increase (decrease) in net assets from stockholder transactions" figure is the equivalent to the company's "distributions to stockholders from net investment company taxable income ("ICTI")" figure. Since this is the only amount within this specific classification, both figures will be the same. This is a fairly simple calculation. This is PSEC's dividend distributions for the fiscal first, second and third quarters of 2016. (Source: Table created entirely by myself, partially using PSEC data obtained from the SEC's EDGAR Database) Using Table 3 above as a reference, the number of outstanding shares of common stock as of 1/27/2016, 2/25/2016 and 3/29/2016 is projected to be 355.4, 355.7 and 356.0 million, respectively. As such, I am projecting 0.3, 0.3 and 0.3 million shares of common stock, net were issued from 1/1/2016 - 1/26/2016, 1/27/2016 - 2/24/2016 and 2/25/2016 - 3/28/2016, respectively. This consists of common stock being issued under PSEC's dividend reinvestment plan. The monthly common stock dividend for the months of January, February and March 2016 was $0.0833 per share. When calculated, I am projecting monthly dividend distributions of ($29.6), ($29.6) and ($29.7) million for January, February and March 2016, respectively. When these three monthly dividend distributions are combined with the six months ended dividend distributions of ($177.9) million, I am projecting PSEC had a decrease in net assets from stockholder transactions of ($266.8) million for the nine months ended 3/31/2016 (see red reference "B" in Table 2 above and blue reference "D" in Tables 2 and 3 above). - See Red Reference "C" in Table 2 Above Next to the March 31, 2016, Column This "net increase (decrease) in net assets from capital share transactions" figure consists of the following four amounts: 1) issuance of common stock, net of underwriting fees (see blue reference "E" in Table 2 above and Table 4 below); 2) offering costs on issuance of common stock (see blue reference "F" in Table 2 above and Table 4 below); 3) issuance of common stock under dividend reinvestment plan (see blue reference "G" in Table 2 above and Table 5 below); and 4) repurchases of common stock (see blue reference "H" in Table 2 above and Table 6 below). - See Blue Reference "E" in Table 2 Above Next to the March 31, 2016, Column - See Blue Reference "E" in Table 4 Below This is PSEC's issuance of common stock, net of underwriting fees for the fiscal first, second and third quarters of 2016. (Source: Table created entirely by myself, partially using PSEC data obtained from the SEC's EDGAR Database [link provided below Table 3]) For the fourth consecutive quarter, I am projecting no shares of common stock were issued under PSEC's "at-the-market" ("ATM") offering program. As such, I am projecting PSEC will report an issuance of common stock, net figure of $0 for the fiscal third quarter of 2016 and for the nine-months ended 3/31/2016 (see blue reference "E" in Tables 2 and 4 above). 2) Offering Costs on Issuance of Common Stock: - Blue Reference "F" in Table 2 Above Next to the March 31, 2016, Column See - Blue Reference "F" in Table 4 Above This figure consists of the offering costs associated with the issuance of common stock. This figure was originally projected within the issuance of common stock, net of underwriting fees figure above. Since I am projecting PSEC only issued shares of common stock through the company's dividend reinvestment plan (discussed next), I am projecting there were $0 of underwriting fees/offering costs for the fiscal third quarter of 2016. Once again using Table 4 above a reference, when this figure is combined with the six-months ended figure of $0.1 million, I am projecting PSEC will report an offering costs on issuance of common stock figure of $0.1 million for the nine months ended 3/31/2016 (see blue reference "F" in Tables 2 and 4 above). 3) Issuance of Common Stock Under Dividend Reinvestment Plan: - See Blue Reference "G" in Table 2 Above Next to the March 31, 2016, Column - See Blue Reference "G" in Table 5 Below This is PSEC's issuance of common stock under the company's dividend reinvestment plan for the fiscal first, second and third quarters of 2016. (Source: Table created entirely by myself, partially using PSEC data obtained from the SEC's EDGAR Database [link provided below Table 3]) Originally discussed within PSEC's distributions to stockholders from net ICTI figure, I am projecting 0.3 million shares of common stock were issued under the company's dividend reinvestment plan for each month during the fiscal third quarter of 2016. Using Table 5 above as a reference, when calculated this is projected proceeds of $1.7, $1.6 and $1.7 million for the months of January, February and March 2016, respectively. When combined, I am projecting PSEC will report an issuance of common stock under the company's dividend reinvestment plan figure of $5.1 million (rounded) for the fiscal third quarter of 2016. Therefore, when this figure is combined with the six-months ended figure of $7.6 million, I am projecting PSEC will report an issuance of common stock under the company's dividend reinvestment plan figure of $12.8 million (rounded) for the nine months ended 3/31/2016 (see blue reference "G" in Tables 2 and 5 above). - See Blue Reference "H" in Table 2 Above Next to the March 31, 2016, Column - See Blue Reference "H" in Table 6 Below This is PSEC's purchases of common stock under the company's share repurchase plan for the fiscal first, second and third quarters of 2016. (Source: Table created entirely by myself, partially using PSEC data obtained from the SEC's EDGAR Database [link provided below Table 3]) I am projecting no shares of common stock were purchased under PSEC's share repurchase plan during the fiscal third quarter of 2016. Even though PSEC's stock price continued to trade at a material discount to NAV throughout the fiscal third quarter of 2016, I am projecting management decided not to repurchase any outstanding shares of common stock. Since any share repurchases by management would have been accretive to PSEC's NAV, I believe not doing so was a negative trend. Using Table 6 above as a reference, when calculated this is projected repurchases of $0 for the fiscal third quarter of 2016. Therefore, when this figure is combined with the six-months ended figure of ($34.1) million, I am projecting PSEC will report repurchases of common stock figure of ($34.1) million for the nine months ended 3/31/2016 (see blue reference "H" in Tables 2 and 6 above). When combining equity raised in common stock issuances, net of underwriting fees of $0, offering costs associated with the issuance of common stock of $0.1 million, equity raised in relation to the company's dividend reinvestment plan of $12.8 million, and repurchases of common stock of ($34.1) million, I am projecting PSEC had a decrease in net assets from capital share transactions of ($21.2) million for the nine months ended 3/31/2016 (see red reference "C" in Table 2 above). To sum up all the information discussed above, I am projecting PSEC will report the following NAV per share as of 3/31/2016: PSEC's Projected NAV as of 3/31/2016 = $9.50 Per Share PSEC's Projected NAV Range as of 3/31/2016 = $9.30-$9.70 Per Share This projection is a decrease of ($0.15) per share from PSEC's NAV as of 12/31//2015. This minor (less than 2%) decrease in NAV can be attributed to the following quarterly per share changes: (Source: Table created entirely by myself, including all calculated figures and projected valuations) Using Table 7 above as a reference, I am projecting PSEC's net decrease in net assets resulting from operations (also known as EPS) was $0.10 per share for the fiscal third quarter of 2016. In comparison, I am projecting PSEC had dividend distributions of ($0.25) per share for the fiscal third quarter of 2016. I am also projecting PSEC had less than ($0.005) per share NAV accretion (dilution) in relation to the company's dividend reinvestment plan for the fiscal third quarter of 2016. After adding these three amounts together, a decrease of ($0.15) per share for the fiscal third quarter of 2016 is obtained. My BUY, SELL or HOLD Recommendation: PSEC recently closed at $7.37 per share as of 5/4/2016. This was a ($2.13) per share discount to my projected PSEC NAV of $9.50 per share as of 3/31/2016. This calculates to a price to NAV ratio of 0.7755 or a discount of (22.45%). When combining the analysis above with various other factors/analytical metrics not discussed within this specific article, I currently rate PSEC as a SELL when the company's stock price is trading at less than a (18%) discount to my projected NAV as of 3/31/2016, a HOLD when trading at or greater than an (18%) but less than a (25%) discount to my projected NAV as of 3/31/2016, and a BUY when trading at or greater than a (25%) discount to my projected NAV as of 3/31/2016. These ranges are a slight upgrade when compared to my last PSEC article due to the recent positive trends within credit markets. Specifically, this includes (but is not limited to) a decrease in volatility within the high yield debt market and the recent increase in loan pricing. As such, I currently rate PSEC as a HOLD. My current price target for PSEC is approximately $7.80 per share. This is currently the price where my HOLD recommendation would change to a SELL. This price target is a $0.30 per share increase when compared to my last PSEC article. My current re-entry price for PSEC is approximately $7.10 per share. This is currently the price where my HOLD recommendation would change to a BUY. For a discussion of what I recently believed were some positive and negative factors to consider when choosing PSEC as a possible equity investment, please see the following prior article: Prospect Capital's Dividend And NAV Sustainability Analysis (Pre-Fiscal Q3 2016 Earnings) - Part 2 Final Note: I first initiated a position in PSEC in October 2013 at prices ranging from $10.80-$10.85 per share. On 7/28/2014, I sold 50% of my position in PSEC at a weighted average sales price of $11.00 per share. On 8/26/2014, I sold my remaining position in PSEC at a weighted average sales price of $10.69. At the time, this disclosure was provided to readers, within subsequent PSEC articles, over the next several months. On 8/27/2015, I once again initiated a position in PSEC at a weighted average purchase price of $7.325 per share. I made a subsequent purchase in PSEC on 2/8/2016 at a weighted average price of $5.445 per share. My second purchase was approximately double the monetary amount of my initial purchase. When calculated, the weighted average purchase price on my PSEC position was $6.072 per share. This weighted average per share price excluded all dividends received/reinvested. I sold my entire PSEC position on 3/2/2016 at a weighted average sales price of $7.495 per share as my price target, at the time, was met. All 2015-2016 trades were disclosed to readers, in "real time," via the "StockTalks" feature of Seeking Alpha (and in prior PSEC articles). Each investor's BUY, SELL or HOLD decision is based on one's risk tolerance, time horizon and dividend income goals. My personal recommendation will not fit each reader's current investing strategy.
