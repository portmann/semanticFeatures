U.S. will urge greater fiscal spending at G20 -Treasury official | Reuters WASHINGTON Feb 22 The United States will call on G20 countries to use all monetary and fiscal tools at their disposal in order to boost global demand, a senior U.S. Treasury official said on Monday. "We will urge greater use of policy space, including fiscal space, to bolster global demand. That would lead to strengthened confidence and I would suspect reduce volatility," the Treasury official said in a preview call with reporters ahead of a G20 meeting later this week in Shanghai, China. G20 finance ministers, including U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, and central bank governors will meet on Feb. 26-27, with sagging global growth, divergent monetary policies and currency devaluations set to dominate the agenda.
