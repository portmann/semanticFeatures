A 14 Percent Infrastructure Fix? | The Big Picture My wife leaves for work earlier than I do, giving her first choice of which car to drive. She has a longer drive than my three-minute jaunt to the train station, so I donâ€™t mind. That often means I get the rear-wheel drive convertible in the snowy winter months, and the all-wheel drive Jeep in the summer. But recently she keeps taking the bouncyÂ  Orange Crush Rubicon . The reason? The broken roads and potholes make the tight suspension of the BMW a horror to drive, despite the fair-weather retractable hardtop. I was thinking about this as we kick off a new federal budget season. About this time, I usually lament the state of U.S. infrastructure, the highway-fund gas tax stuck in the early 1990s and other assorted indignities (seeÂ  this ,Â  this ,Â  this Â andÂ  this ). The people who live in civilized nations shouldn’t have to face this sort ofÂ  failure Â of basic government. And yet this year a few things are giving me a small measure of hope that we could see an uptick in infrastructure funding: â€¢Â States such as Utah have been raising Â local gas taxes Â to pay for infrastructure needs; â€¢ Various disasters (Amtrak derailment) and media coverage (“ 60 Minutes ” on bridge collapses) are raising the publicâ€™s awareness and increasing pressure on aÂ  do-nothing Congress ; There is something unusual in that last bullet point, one that might make it possible to make headway.Â The clever twist is that President Barack Obama has taken boosting infrastructure spending — a favorite policy of Democrats — and tied it to a favorite policy of Republicans — reforming corporate taxes. Thus, this opening bid has generated some interest from both sides of the aisle. Please use the comments to demonstrate your own ignorance, unfamiliarity with empirical data and lack of respect for scientific knowledge. Be sure to create straw men and argue against things I have neither said nor implied. If you could repeat previously discredited memes or steer the conversation into irrelevant, off topic discussions, it would be appreciated. Lastly, kindly forgo all civility in your discourse . . . you are, after all, anonymous. The infrastructure demand is growing in the heart of Tea Party country due to the recent flooding. I expect the requests for federal funding from people who don’t believe the federal government should fund anything to start rolling in any day now. The requests will be for bridges, roads, and US Army Corps levees to prevent flooding of newly developed land, as well as defending the right to subsidized flood insurance. No more. Which is why I now consider myself a “conservative independent.” Michigan is literally falling apart, and the dittoheads in the legislature are unable to find a way to raise revenue to fix the problem (they mostly fantasize about spending cuts elsewhere). They put a complex, convoluted stupid ballot proposal up in May that lost 20/80 %. Ohio cobbled together some funding via a turnpike lease out deal which will cost motorists for eons. â€‹Jack Bossidy explains how the wealthy justify it on CNBC today, “Thereâ€‹ will be no tax reform because the President refuses to lower top marginal rates.” So you see. in this Era of the Greedy Rich they are holding your infrastructure hostage, you health insurance, you bank protections, immigration, EVERYTHING for tax cuts for themselves. It’s never enough.  I say we attach tax hikes for the rich to every bill, keep pushing to raise taxes on the wealthy at every opportunity until they shut the fuck up and let the country continue on its way. My complaint here is there is too narrow a view of infrastructure.  It isn’t limited to roads and bridges.  Wireless and wifi everywhere, fiber everywhere, updated grid and more solar, electrify some trains, make them autonomous (Google should be able to do this), more battery research, more basic research, more research into improving healthcare efficiency.  There are a world of ideas out there. Don’t count on local municipality spending to pick up any of the slack. In fact they are slack creators.
