Look Who’s Spending Less: Higher-Earning, Older Americans  - Real Time Economics - WSJ A new report findsÂ mid- and upper-income Americans, and those older than 65, pulled back on spending sharply from mid 2014 through June, while outlays among those younger than 35 and those with lower incomes held up fairly well. Americans who have money to spend arenâ€™t doing so, a factor that is depressing consumer outlays despite low gasoline prices and steady hiring. Recently, the pace of consumer spending, outside of big-ticket items such as cars and homes, has eased . Thatâ€™s puzzled economists who expected solid hiring, improving wage gains and cheap gasoline to drive improved spending. DataÂ  released Wednesday by the JPMorgan Chase & Co. Institute Â sheds new lights on what’s happening. The report found mid- and upper-income Americans, and those older than 65, pulled back on spending sharply from mid 2014 through June, while outlays among those younger than 35 and those with lower incomes held up fairly well. The institute taps into anonymized data from 48 million JPMorgan customers in 15 U.S. metro areas to revealÂ Â spending patterns. The report found overallÂ spending on â€œeverydayâ€? products and servicesâ€”the type of purchases you would put on your credit or debit cardâ€”rose just 0.5% in the second quarter of 2015, from a year earlier. For the prior year, before gas prices dipped and hiring accelerated, spending rose a robust 5%. The data is not inflation adjusted, and price increases were stronger in late 2013 and early 2014. Those on the lower end of the income spectrum areÂ the ones whose budgets benefit most from lower gasoline prices. They are also among that portion of the population likeliest to have found jobs in fast-growing but low-paying industries such as restaurants and retailers. Lower-earning workers tend to spend most of what they earn. Meanwhile, those with larger paychecks may have investments or jobs that make them more nervous about a shaky global economy and turbulence in financial markets. â€œLow-income households and those under 35 have a lot less discretion about whether theyâ€™re going to spend more or less,â€? while higher earners “have quite a bit,” said Diana Farrell, the institute’s chief executive. The overall JPMorgan data tracks fairly closely with other measures of consumer spending. Retail spending excluding automotive purchases has decelerated this year, according to Commerce Department data. The JPMorgan data showed that the top 40% of earners were a drag on any growth in consumer spending beginning in February. The biggest pullback in spending, of course, came from less-costly fuel purchases. But spending on durable goods, long-lasting items such as appliances and computers, also declined in the second quarter. Contributions to spending growth from services and nondurable items, like clothing and food, eased in the first half of this year. The data also broke down spending patterns geographically. It showed spending growth from July 2013 through June 2014 was very uneven. Spending in theÂ Seattle and Dallas areas grew more than 10% while consumer outlays in metro Atlanta fell more than 6%. In contrast, the slowdown from July 2014 through June 2015 wasÂ uniform. About half of the metro areas tracked showed a small increase and half showed a small decrease.

I always like to see ignorance used to shore up a set of beliefs.  Wait, no, I hate that. So, why would Economists, who spend their lives studying why this kind of thing happens, be puzzled but an ignorant dude like yourself knows right away? Because, you dont know your own limitiations, and so you dont know when the SMART thing to say is "I don't know". So you take your PERSONAL situation and use it to make ignorant, belief based statements about the population as a whole. On the flip side, an economist who spends their life studying this sees the behavior of the population as a whole, and rather than taking their own personal experience and saying "That must be the reason", they instead say "Hmm, lets take a look at this and see WHY its happening." And that right there is a perfect example of why Americans are so damn stupid.  We think we know stuff, and deride those who actually recognize their limitations, and try to LEARN what really is. Only economists would be puzzled by this, older folks like myself already have most of what they need and don't WANT for a lot of new gadgets, these days most of the new offerings are worthless electronic devices and not of ant use to most older people. They are also keeping the money close to them because of the current gov't moron's who want to tax them to death. Actually, many goods prices declined in 2015, likely impacting the JPM analysis. In all, most of the recent â€œtrendsâ€? seem to be caused by diverging inflation patterns between energy, goods ex-energy and services. Between February and September 2015, Goods deflated 2.9% YoY on average with Durables prices down 2.2%. Meanwhile, Services prices rose 1.9% on average. In case you did not notice, Energy Goods and Services prices was â€“17.9% during the same period. The diverging inflation trends are enough to totally disrupt analysis based on nominal dollars. Too bad because this is an awesome database. Older Americans that STILL have some money do so because they are not stupid. Anyone with half a brain sees a manipulated economy, and will pull back on spending. Most young people don't care. They cannot buy a house, do not want a fancy car, if they want a car at all, and will not be starting families until much latter in life, if at all. I note how many gamble on sports, buy Lotto tickets, and engage in dangerous sports. All consistent with the belief they will never be able to afford a good life in a country saddled with massive debt. Might as well give up and enjoy yourself. Oh, and elect the politicians that give away more free stuff. For my wife and I, mid fifties in perfect health, our Bluecross BlueShield health insurance premiums  will increase 134% in 2016 to $1,585.00 monthly = $19,020 annual with $11,000 deductible.  The Affordable Healthcare Act is making an impact to discretionary spending.  The ACA is a terrible law.
