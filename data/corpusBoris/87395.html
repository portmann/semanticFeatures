Good morning and welcome to Synutra International fourth quarter fiscal 2015 earnings conference call. Today, I will begin with the updates on our operational initiatives. Then Clare will review our financial results and outlook in more detail. After that we will hold a question-and-answer session. We are pleased to report another strong quarter, overall we're very happy with both our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results. In the fourth quarter we achieved record sales of 105.1 million in our core Nutritional Food segment. Sales for this segment were up 18.8% year-over-year, gross profit in the segment was up 44.8% year-over-year and overall gross profit increased by 41.7% over the prior year period. During the fourth fiscal quarter net profit attributable to common shareholders was up $14 million, an increase of 138.7% year-over-year and we recorded earnings per share of $0.42. Throughout fiscal 2015, we focused our efforts on improving the efficiency of our sales channel and building our brand equity through direct communication with the customers using mobile internet technologies. As a Chinese infant formula industry is experiencing downward pricing pressure due to intensified promotion activities among our peers and increasing online sales, Synutra is focused on differentiating our products through service and quality and building brand loyalty through our customer interaction programs. The growth that we experienced during the fourth quarter this year over the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 was driven by a 5.5% increase in tons of milk formula sold and almost 13% increase in average selling price. The breakdown -- to breakdown our growth in this segment further, our exclusively marketed private label products contributed 34% of the [second] growth. This category includes the My Angel brands product which are sold directly to mom and baby stores with our distributors and product under the 25 to 30 small brands that we acquired over the past several quarters which we sell to exclusive distributors in [indiscernible] areas. This business experience a 35% growth year-over-year, which represents our success in gradually consolidating small brand and players in the infant milk formula market. We expect the powdered milk formula industry to continue its consolidation trend in the near future. Based on the Chinese government's policy changes last year, we expect that our private label business will continue to benefit from this trend. Our specialty formula products sales grew 36% year over year and contributed 13% of overall growth in nutritional food segment. The specialty category of the Chinese infant milk formula market has experienced a strong growth since the third quarter of 2013 as competitors try to maintain their ASP growth by upgrading their product mix. Synutra is the leader in this category including both prescription and OTC types of specialty formula products and we expect it to be a source of consistent growth in the future. Our online sales channel continues to be a small percentage of our overall sales as our e-commerce strategy is currently more focused on our online to offline customer service platform. Clare will discuss our related Kangaroo program in greater detail in a few minutes. We continue to make significant progress on this front during the March quarter including the growth in active members registered on our centralized database and the rollout of our company WeChat account with group chat function. Despite from these three niche infant milk formula market segment our three traditional channels the key account, Minimart and mom and baby channels contributed 53% of the 18.8% overall growth. As we have discussed in September of last year we launched the four new premium products in response to a strong demand in the market for more premium milk formula options. In particular, sales of one of these products the advanced super formula was hydrolyzed proteins as being highly successful and it now contributes more than 10% of total infant milk formula sales. The success of this product will help to defend the market share and brand equity of our mainstream super brand without taking part in the discount war. And will lay the foundation for us to increase our production volume and market share when the capacity of our French facility comes online. Now to update you on the progress we are making on our facility in France. Construction continues to progress on schedule, currently construction of the lower buildings is finished and we have started to install equipment for the drying towers including evaporators and spray dryer. For the taller buildings construction of the roof is under way. We will expect to begin trial operations of the drying towers in the fourth quarter of calendar 2015. This formal operations beginning in the first quarter of calendar 2016 at which time trial operations will begin in the mixing and packaging facility we expect it to be able to start settings bulk milk powder and whey protein powder from our trench facility in the first three months of 2016 which will provide some incremental revenue under the other business segment in fiscal 2016. We plan to start importing our 100% French produced infant formula to the Chinese market in the second quarter of calendar year 2016 after we receive certification from the Chinese FDA. We spent $95 million in capital expenditures in fiscal year 2015 mostly for the French project. We funded the CapEx with cash on hand and the proceeds from the sale of subsidiaries. Our net debt position only marginally increased during the fiscal 2015 in fiscal 2016 we expect to spend over $120 million in capital expenditures, still mostly for the French project. We plan to fund the CapEx by drawing the €53 million project finance line from Bank of China which was unused as of March 31st, 2015 and by operating cash flows. We also expect to secure working capital alliance from the French subsidiary with banks in France, after the project starts its trial operations. We continue to believe that the French project was a good investment opportunity, which will significantly enhance our market position and profitability. At this point I would like to turn the call over to Clare to review our financial results as well as provide an outlook on our business. Clare? Thank you Weiguo. I would like to start by reviewing our fourth quarter financial performance. For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 our net sales were 110.2 million an increase of 11.6% from 98.7 million for the prior year period. Net sales from our Nutritional Food segment which includes branded powdered formula as well as branded baby and adult food products, were 105.1 million, or 95.4% of net sales, in the fourth quarter. This represents an increase of 18.8% over the fourth quarter last year in which we recorded sales of 88.4 million, or 89.6% of net sales. This increase was primarily driven by a 12.6% increase in average selling price, supported by a 5.5% increase in milk formula sales by volume over the prior year period. Sales of powdered formula products increased to 7,356 tons in the fourth quarter, compared to 6,974 tons in the prior year period. Average selling price was 14,283 per ton, compared to 12,682 per ton in the prior year period. Net sales from the Nutritional Supplement segment were 4.6 million, or 4.1% of sales which was in line with 4.1 million in the prior year which also accounted for 4.1% of sales. This segment is primarily comprised of sales of chondroitin sulfate materials to international pharmaceutical companies. Net sales from the Other Business segments, which mainly consists of imported whole milk powder and whey protein powder sold to industrial customers, was 0.6 million, or 0.5% of net sales, compared to $6.2 million, or 6.3% of net sales, in the prior year period. These sales are always opportunistic as we sell excess raw milk powder and raw milk and raw whey powder that cannot be used in our formula products due to defecting color or consistency that make it not suitable to be put directly into an infant formula product under our dry mixing production method, but is otherwise fresh and safe to use for general food industries purposes. During the fourth quarter we started using infant-grade whole milk powder from Fonterra, which conforms to our dry mixing standard better method and thus contains smaller percentages that are unusable for infant formula dry mixed products. As such we have much less active milk powder for resale. Year-over-year unit production cost for our powdered formula products decreased by 10% as the price of whole milk powder used in production decreased by 45% and whole milk powder represents approximately 23% of overall cost. The decrease however was largely offset by an inventory provision for our imported super series of products which we launched in 2003 to meet the market demand for premium products. However we discontinued that product by the fourth quarter of calendar 2014 as the OEM supply of this product has experienced several disruptions and we were able to launch the advanced super series as our new premium product offering. Given this overall unit cost of goods sold for our IMS product remained flat year-over-year. Gross margin Nutritional Food segment however increased from 44.8% in the fourth quarter last year to 51.4% in this year due to higher ASPs. Gross profit was 54.2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 compared to 38.2 million in the prior year period. Gross margin was 49.2% an increase from 38.7% in the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the increased contribution to total net sales from the nutritional food segment and supported by the increased gross margin of that segment. Moving on to selling and distribution expenses which were 14.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, compared to 13.0 million in the prior year period. Advertising and promotional expenses were $10.9 million in Q4, compared to $3.9 million in the prior year period. These two expenses combined increased as a percentage of sales to 23.1% in the fourth quarter from 17.1% in the prior year period. The increase was primarily attributable to a 4.7% one-time government subsidy to promotional expenses which we received in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. General and administrative expenses were 6.5 million a slight decrease from 6.7 million in the prior year period. Income from operations was $16.6 million in the fiscal fourth quarter which represents a 19.4% increase over 13.9 million in the prior year period. Included in this number is a 5.8 million non-recurring impairment charge which was mainly to the assets of our baby and adult food business. Net interest expenses were 1.8 million down from 3.0 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 which is partly due to the 0.5 million capitalized interest for the French project and partly due to the fact that our overall borrowing cost continued to decline as we shifted more of our borrowing from R&D to foreign currencies and shifted more of our restricted cash which is 100% for our bank borrowing purposes from short term deposits to long term deposits. We recognized an income tax benefit of 7.5 million in the fourth quarter this year compared to income tax expenses of 23,000 in the prior year period. During the March quarter we were able to reverse 11.3 million of our valuation allowances on deferred tax assets which was recorded as an income tax benefit. This was partially offset by a tax provision on actual income of 3.8 million in the fourth quarter. Our statutory tax rate is 25% and going forward we expect on the effected tax rate to be more closely in line with this statutory rate. Net income attributable to common stockholders was 24.1 million or $0.42 per share for the fiscal fourth quarter compared to net income of 10.1 million, or $0.18 per share, in the same period last year. Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents of 85.2 million and restricted cash of 224.7 million, which includes the current and non-current portions. Total cash including restricted and non-restricted cash was 309.9 million versus $276.2 million at the end of third quarter of fiscal 2015. As of March 31, 2015 total debt was 420.7 million representing an increase of 34 million from the end of third fiscal quarter. We note that while our cash expenditures on fixed assets mostly for the French project totalled 95 million during fiscal 2015, our net debt which is total debt less total cash increased by only 277,000 which means that we have funded this year's project CapEx mainly through free cash flow from operations, proceeds from assets sales and cash on hand. Net accounts receivable was 15.4 million, a decrease from $20.6 million in the third fiscal quarter. This is mainly due to delivery timing under the nutritional supplement segment. Our general payment policy for the formula segment is delivery upon payment. As of March 31, 2015 our inventory position was 87.8 million compared to 85 million at the end of prior quarter. With that I would now like to provide an update on our mobile internet based customer service program the Kangaroo program. Since we launched this program in April 2014 we have seen a continuous rise in active members registered with our centralized database which we define as customers who have purchased our product within the last two months. The total counts of active members under our database registered through our treasure in hand sales management mobile application has gone from 150,000 in April 2014 to approximately 400,000 currently. We view this increase as an indication of the success of our online to offline program. As we revised incentive system to persuade our promoters to move the information of the customers they developed offline from their individual notebooks to our centralized treasuring hand mobile application. Our Kangaroo program also encourage the promoters to use the treasuring hand ATP to manage or remote into actions with customers including cost, text messages and WeChat messages. Our sales staff can use ATP to monitor the activeness and effectiveness of such interactions off the promoters they supervise and have quarter sales management team can use the data from the ATP to monitor and modify our sales team induction. The next step which is scheduled to be completed by the end of this month is for the promoters to move WeChat [scoops] from their individual accounts to sub-accounts under the [some mama] public account on the by Synutra. [Some mama] means [mutri mama] in Chinese. This will shift the WeChat based group community from being personal assets of the promoters to company assets through which Synutra can monitor, manage and communicate with members. We have developed several features that will make the [some mama] account standout among the many public WeChat accounts our customers may face every day including access to leading pediatricians in China and daily child [wearing] knowledge sharing to make sure this account stay at the top of WeChat message lists among other features. Our goal is to build [some mama] into a lively and useful online community for our customers through which we can communicate with and serve our customers as a means of enhancing customer loyalty. Through the Kangaroo program, we also aim to train our in-store promoters to become marketers that can keep up with the e-commerce area and to recruit part-time WeChat based promoters both of which we call nutritional consultant. Later in fiscal 2016, we will roll out our WeChat based shopping malls or [somewhat] and encourage our nutritional consultants and consumers to complete sales on these virtual malls rather than in the actual stores which will further our store reduction philosophy under the Gold Mining strategy. In September 2012, when we first launched our Gold Mining strategy we have made steady progress towards our offline to online transition and have maintained a careful balance between nurturing our online platform vis-à-vis supporting offline sales momentum. We expect fiscal 2016 to be the year when we will start to see this effort to show in numbers including customer care, marketing and sales numbers. The success of our O2O program is key to our ability to better utilize the capacity from our French projects and to break through in our market-share growth. And now, I will like to discuss our outlook for fiscal year 2016. For this fiscal year, we expect to see continued growth momentum in the Nutritional Food segment mainly driven by powdered formula products and greater operating leverage as sales expense. We expect full year sales growth for our Nutritional Food segment to be between to 10% to 15% over fiscal year 2015 results. Total net sales are expected to be between 450 million to 500 million, as there can be more variance from the sales of bulk packaged milk and whey powder in the Other Business segment. In the coming fiscal year, we expect to incur income tax expense consistent with the statutory rate of 25% in fiscal 2016 compared to the income tax benefit recorded in fiscal 2015 due to the reversal of valuation allowance. As such we expect net income for fiscal 2016 to be between 50 million and 60 million, in line with non-GAAP net income for fiscal 2015. For fiscal 2017, we continue to expect stronger top-line growth driven by the Nutritional Food segment performance after the opening of the French facility and equally strong bottom-line growth driven by the expected production cost savings from the French facility. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from the line of Peter Siris [ph], please ask your question. Peter Siris now, hi. I've two questions. The first question is I'd like to understand what's happening in the industry as a whole with the consolidation, I know the government has announced that it wants Chinese companies to have a larger share, some of the international companies said that pricing issues, but could you just sort of generally describe you know what's happening in the industry now and where you see it going in the next year or so. Thank you Peter. What we see in the industry is that the downward pressure on pricing is increasing due to the rapid growth of e-commerce or online sales and the offline sales channels are more and more used to a separate lower pricing system for online sales and the leading brands are more and more dependent on promotions to maintain their market shares, us not included but we see our competitors are doing, are extending their promotional campaigns which has become a continuous phenomenon. So overall the downward pressure on pricing has increased. But we are still seeing the offline pricing system to remain at the current nominal level without a direct reduction on pricing. So if the price reductions are still coming in the form of discounts rather than direct change to price. On the other hand we are also seeing support for premium products just like those for our advanced super products. So I think we can call this as the end to the rapid price increase or premium pricing era and maybe the beginning of a discounting era or price war era, but it's still -- we are hearing from [stating not the real soldiers] at this moment, but it can happen this year or maybe next year. We are sure that in three years we'll see a price correction to be more in line with the international markets level. So that's a. on the pricing and b. on the domestic brands versus international brands government policy, this has been announced in the whitepaper issued by the government back in 2013 and the goal was stated as that the government wants the top 10 domestic brands to account for 65% of the market by the end of 2015 and 80% of the market by the end of 2018. It's mid 2015 now and it seems like the first goal is not going to be reached. But the government's overall stance remains the same that they want to support the growth of large domestic brands like us and they want to see the domestic brands to take over the lead or be larger than the international brands combined. In the long run we think the domestic leading brands versus international leading brands will be 60 to 40 split which is an increase from the current level. That so far since the whitepaper was published we haven't seen explicit financial support that will actually help to gain the shares in the real market but we see the overall policy orientation and if there is merger and acquisition plan maybe the approval will become smoother or there can be a specialized fund to fund to support the consolidation of domestic market shares. So that's the government stance and see in terms of consolidation, right now as I said we've seen the signs of price war we haven't -- it's not started yet so we still see the smaller brands which we estimate to be about 30% of the overall market including the domestic minor brands and imported minor brands. Phase two account for 30% for the market and they survive because of the high price or the high spread that they can pay to the channels. And if the price was really starts they will be the first one to take the hit. And my second question is I see the guidance for this year and I see the timing of the French business coming on but because you have invested so much money in France and it's so large, could you give us -- help in understanding how the French business -- what kind of impact the French business could have say in 2017 and 2018? How much… So I assume you are asking us for the guidance on fiscal 2017 and 2018 which will be the first… I am not asking for guidance for the whole company, what I am trying to -- I just want to understand how the timing of the French business and how large it is compared to the existing business. I am not asking you to commit to an earnings and sales numbers. I am trying to understand the impact of that particular piece. So the French project will have full financial impact starting from fiscal 2017. And fiscal 2017 and 2018 will be the first two years that its online for the full fiscal year. And when we look at the French projects we would like to divide it into two parts, one is the original drying tower which has 45,000 tons of drying capacity for whole milk powder and 45,000 tons for oil wrapped whey protein. The other part is the dry mixing and packaging line to produce infant's milk formula products. So we will be -- we planned to utilize the drying capacity -- the drying towers at their full capacity from Day 1 of formal operation. The current towers owned by [indiscernible] and maybe other smaller towers the local farmers and cheese production facilities will stop sending their milk or liquid whey to these existing towers, the main ones are the [indiscernible] towers which are to retire. And they will instead shift the milk and whey to our towers and we will have full capacity every day from the day they switch to us. So with the full capacity of 100% utilization we expect which means there is no higher depreciation fixed cost. So we expect our cost structure for the two ingredients, the whole milk powder and whey powder to be competitive with Fonterra or [indiscernible] and we expect to save the current margins that the two suppliers make by vertical integration and we expect to save the processing cost by eliminating the oil wrapping process. That is expected to contribute a 5% saving to gross margin, or a 5% increase to gross margin that’s on the drying tower part. And that’s for the infant formula products and we expect to sell the excess bulk powder as industry commodities to the market and because it's commodity as long as we can and it's of premium quality as always we can give away a little bit of upside gain we assure to sell the powder. So that’s for the drying tower portion. And for the dry mixing and the packaging portion it will be the same as what we have in [indiscernible] now. So basically we’re doubling our capacity or less than doubling our capacity. And that leads us to increase our sales to improve the utilization for dry mixing and packaging facility. And the follow-up. With the French -- with the product you bring in from France have a different plan and different marketing strategy or will just be part of what you have now? It will under our mainstream super brand, it's the super 58 as the primary product. So we do not expect to have a new brand but it's 100% made in France which is a big difference in Chinese consumers' eyes. So we are going to be able to offer our 100% imported products that’s why we built the dry mixing and packaging facility in France which is our domestic competitors are all investing in foreign packaging capacity so that’s taken import to 100% foreign made products to China also around the time we will complete our French facility. So A, the dry mixing and packaging facility in France is a big defensive position so that we can offer the same 100% imported product, but B, it's also an offensive investment because we will have the whole milk powder and whey powder produced freshly on site in the same site whereas most of our competitors will be investing in facilities in Australia and New Zealand where they still need to import whey powder from Europe Americas. Which means there products is way less fresh than our product in France and thirdly our 100% imported products may give us an end goal to be priced differently without disrupting the offline pricing systems it can be a unique product offering in our some large program which will help us to defend or gain market share in the coming price environment.
