Learn more about PRO » Lannettâ€™s fiscal Q3 revenue missed views as the company had a labeling issue with its C-Topical product. The company raised the full-year revenue guidance and provided a preliminary view on fiscal 2016 revenue and gross margins. The company has acquired Silarx Pharmaceuticals and a transformative acquisition is likely on the horizon. Lannett (NYSE: LCI ) is down more than 20% since mid-April and the market clearly did not like the fiscal Q3 report. The company guided for low single-digit revenue growth in fiscal 2016 which may have caused the recent share price correction, but those who were following this story would have known this already and they would also have known that this is in fact an improvement compared to management's previous view for a slightly down or flat year in terms of revenue growth. The market is also valuing Lannett as a no-growth stock given its TTM and forward valuation and it is also neglecting the fact that the company is actively looking at acquisition candidates which may significantly impact the future expectations and likely positively affect its tax rate. Management conservatism is another reason to be optimistic as well as the fact that the initial view on fiscal 2016 does not include product launches, acquisitions or partnerships. I am reiterating my view and price target on Lannett and I believe that an important catalyst (a transformative acquisition) is on the horizon which should push the stock significantly higher in the next 6 to 12 months. Lannett's fiscal Q3 revenue increased 24% to $99.4 million, missing analyst estimates by $1.7 million. The revenue miss should be attributed to a C-Topical labeling issue which has been resolved in the meantime, but which has resulted in $2.4 million less revenue from the product in the quarter. The company now expects fiscal 2015 sales in the range of $403 million to $408 million, up from $395 million to $405 million and it also expects gross margin between 75% and 76%, up from 74% to 75%. SG&A expenses should be $3.5 million higher than previously expected while capital expenditures should be $12.5 million lower at the mid-point of the new guidance. Most product categories performed well with solid Y/Y growth while Digoxin was the exception. Digoxin sales declined sequentially on increased competition, and this was expected and guided by Lannett management in previous earnings calls. The company expects Digoxin sales in fiscal Q4 to be similar to the levels achieved in fiscal Q3. Fiscal 2016 guidance likely very conservative and does not include product launches, acquisitions and partnerships The market is most likely disappointed with management's early view on fiscal 2016 revenues and margins. The company expects low single-digit revenue growth in fiscal 2016 and gross margin in the low 70's, which is a couple of percentage points below the expected gross margin in fiscal 2015. What is important to note here is that management has been historically conservative with its guidance in the past (see table below and compare the initial revenue and gross margin guidance with the reported numbers), and there is no reason to believe that this is not the case once again. The fiscal 2016 revenue guidance does not include any product launches, acquisitions and new partnerships which will likely happen in the next six to twelve months and drive top and bottom line growth ahead of expectations. Lannett currently has 20 ANDAs pending at the FDA and additional 42 products in various stages of development, and a couple of them will likely be marketed in the following quarters. Lannett also has exclusive distribution rights for all filings from its partner Sunshine Lake, the U.S. subsidiary of the HEC Pharm Group from China. Sunshine Lake expects to get two products approved shortly and has about 15 ANDAs pending at the FDA, and these potential approvals are also not baked into the preliminary guidance for fiscal 2016. I expect that these approvals and launches will drive higher than expected revenue growth in fiscal 2016 in addition to the existing business growing ahead of management's initial expectations which have proven to be very conservative in the past two years. Lannett has been active on the M&A front for some time now, and has finally pulled the trigger with the Silarx Pharmaceuticals acquisition . The transaction should close in early June and Silarx will bring an FDA approved manufacturing facility, R&D expertise and further diversify Lannett's pipeline. A transformative deal is also possible and the company is looking to globalize the business and enhance shareholder value through an acquisition in a tax favorable jurisdiction. I believe that the probability of this happening has increased and I think that we will see a deal announcement in fiscal 2016, which is another way for the company to boost top line growth and globalize its operations while having a lower overall tax rate which will significantly increase its bottom line. Product alliances and additional tuck in acquisitions are also likely and management stated that they are also in discussions with potential partners and looking at other candidates. I am reiterating my bullish view and $82 price target on Lannett and I believe that the market is wrong by giving the company such a low valuation (TTM and forward P/E around 15). The long-term growth story remains intact and I think that the company will significantly outperform its initial fiscal 2016 guidance. New product launches, partnerships, and acquisitions are not baked into these preliminary expectations and they have the potential to significantly boost future growth rates. Competition remains the main risk to the thesis and we can see what could in the case of Digoxin, which has been negatively affected by competitors coming back to market. Substantial price increases are also probably behind us and volume growth, new product launches and acquisitions will likely be the drivers of top and bottom line growth in the following years.
