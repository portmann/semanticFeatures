At the Cato Institute Monetary Policy Conference, Part 2 | The Aleph Blog David Merkel is an investment professional, and like every investment professional, he makes mistakes. David encourages you to do your own independent "due diligence" on any idea that he talks about, because he could be wrong. Nothing written here, at RealMoney, Wall Street All-Stars, or anywhere else David may write is an invitation to buy or sell any particular security; at most, David is handing out educated guesses as to what the markets may do. David is fond of saying, "The markets always find a new way to make a fool out of you," and so he encourages caution in investing. Risk control wins the game in the long run, not bold moves. Even the best strategies of the past fail, sometimes spectacularly, when you least expect it. David is not immune to that, so please understand that any past success of his will be probably be followed by failures. Also, though David runs Aleph Investments, LLC, this blog is not a part of that business. This blog exists to educate investors, and give something back. It is not intended as advertisement for Aleph Investments; David is not soliciting business through it. When David, or a client of David's has an interest in a security mentioned, full disclosure will be given, as has been past practice for all that David does on the web. Disclosure is the breakfast of champions. Additionally, David may occasionally write about accounting, actuarial, insurance, and tax topics, but nothing written here, at RealMoney, or anywhere else is meant to be formal "advice" in those areas. Consult a reputable professional in those areas to get personal, tailored advice that meets the specialized needs that David can have no knowledge of. 11/11/15 – Wednesday’s Interest-ing Reads | Compound Interest-ing! on On Lump Sum Distributions Weekend studying: The grandfatherly recommendation you perhaps by no means had | Posts on One Dozen Thoughts on Dealing with Risk in Investing for Retirement Weekend reading: The grandfatherly advice you maybe never had | Since 1996: expat-world.com means Offshore tax avoidance with protection on One Dozen Thoughts on Dealing with Risk in Investing for Retirement Philip Horner on Don’t be a Miser in Retirement (Or Ever) Panel starts with Hilsenrath introducingÂ Manuel SÃ¡nchez. Â Argues that monetary policy should have modest objectives. Â Takes a conventional view that some inflation is good, that monetary policy is powerful and can deal with macroeconomic problems. Â Favors the lender of last resort powers of the Central Bank a la Bagehot. Monetary policy can best serve markets by not being distracted from the main goals — low inflation and macroeconomic stability. Â If monetary policy gets too many goals, it will not achieve its important goals, and may not truly achieve much useful at all. Â After all, look at the loose policy prior to the Great Depression, and possibly loose policy prior to the recent financial crisis. Current policy may be creating financial imbalances now, and lack of incentive for governments to get their own houses in order. Emerging economies have their own issues with monetary policy, with many cutting rates (DM: competitive devaluation). Â Now many emerging economy central reverse those moves, amid rising risks. NowÂ George S. Tavlas — should monetary policy be based on rules vs discretion? Â Taylor Rule makes monetary policy transparent and predictable. Â Failure to follow the Taylor Rule 2003-6 led to the financial crisis. Â Bernanke argues for freedom. Asks what would Milton Friedman would do now? Â Depends on which Milton Friedman you talk about, as he was a Keynesian (1946) and became a monetarist. Â W/Schwartz in 1948, started writing their book on monetary policy. Â Their arguments stemmed from the long run effect, versus a short run effect which could be highly variable. Â Argued that the collapse of monetary aggregates in 1929-32 led to the Great Depression, and that a simple rule could prevent stupid policymakers. Friedman felt that feedback policy rulesÂ injected too much judgment and discretion, and model risk. Yet they would be better than raw discretion. Â Arthur Burns, teacher of Friedman in the 50s, former Fed Chair, gave into political pressure. Â Tavlas thinks that the performance of monetary policy in 90s would favorably dispose Friedman to a Taylor rule. Cites what Bernanke said to Friedman at his 90th birthday. Â Odd comment on how a rule at U Chicago led to Friedman’s marriage to Rose. NowÂ Jeffrey M. Lacker,Â President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. Â Argues that monetary policy is undiminished in its ability to affect the price level in the long term. Â Ability to affect real variables is limited and transitory. Argues on a popular view of resource use a la the Phillips curve — that overuse of resources leads to inflation. Argues that the zero lower bound does not constrain policy now, but that short rates should rise now. Â The existing inflation rates may be overly low for random reasons. Doesn’t think that the increase in the Fed’s balance sheet has any long-term effect on the economy. Argues for limited goals for monetary policy. Q&A 1 — Hilsenrath: talk about monetary policy inflation targets. Gold standard, NGDP, etc., should there be a discussion for a new target on monetary policy? Lacker — present target works well. Â Absent a rule a la Taylor other rules will not work well. Â Gold standard does not work well, and does not provide price stability. Lacker — that should not be a goal for monetary policy. Tavlas — gold standard had adjustment methods that worked pre-1914. Â Unemployment was not a consideration. Union power in the 20s pushed for employment as a factor in monetary policy, and wages would no longer adjust lower. Argues that when rates wereÂ raised to deal with an incipient asset bubble — great depression. Â Eventually said that the CPI was a fine goal. Sanchez also agrees with a CPI goal. Â Says it is difficult to spot bubbles, and they may be due to fiscal policies. Q2 — Mike Mork, Â asksÂ about the drop in velocity of M2. Â Why? Lacker doesn’t know. Â (Nice honest answer.) Â Increase in currency abroad? Q3 — Lacker says that non-economists are a good influence on the FOMC and a diversity of views. Lacker — Economists disagree with each other. Q5 — Josh Crum — what do you do with people bypassing banks in the future? Lacker — not sure how what the Fed can or should do on that issue. Â Has a lot of thoughts, but not so many conclusions. Â Mentions repos and money market funds, and the need for maturity transformation. Q6 — Hilsenrath — should the ECB do more QE? Tavlas — takes time for monetary policy to work. Â Should eventually work. Q7 — David Malpass — will the Fed raising rates be stimulative? Lacker can’t see stimulus. Â Can’t see how credit demand would increase even if supply does. Q8 — Hilsenrath asks how Fed’s moves may affect Mexican monetary policy Sanchez — Fed creates volatility,Â with rising rates peso may devalue, and inflation may rise in Mexico, but we will adjust to conditions as the Mexican economy changes. Â They will takes foreign monetary policy into account as it affects inflation. He thinks they have been lucky so far. Hilsenrath — how does the global slowdown affect your policy? David J. Merkel, CFA, FSA, is a leading commentator at the excellent investment website RealMoney.com .  Back in 2003, after several years of correspondence, James Cramer invited David to write for the site, and write he does — on equity and bond portfolio management, macroeconomics, derivatives, quantitative strategies, insurance issues, corporate governance, and more.  His specialty is looking at the interlinkages in the markets in order to understand individual markets better. David is also presently a senior investment analyst at Hovde Capital, responsible for analysis and valuation of investment opportunities for the FIP funds, particularly of companies in the insurance industry.  He also manages the internal profit sharing and charitable endowment monies of the firm. Prior to joining Hovde in 2003, Merkel managed corporate bonds for Dwight Asset Management. In 1998, he joined the Mount Washington Investment Group as the Mortgage Bond and Asset Liability manager after working with Provident Mutual, AIG and Pacific Standard Life. His background as a life actuary has given David a different perspective on investing.  How do you earn money without taking undue risk?  How do you convey ideas about investing while showing a proper level of uncertainty on the likelihood of success?  How do the various markets fit together, telling us us a broader story than any single piece?  These are the themes that David will deal with in this blog. Merkel holds bachelor’s and master’s degrees from Johns Hopkins University.  In his spare time, he takes care of his eight children with his wonderful wife Ruth. View all posts by David Merkel ?
