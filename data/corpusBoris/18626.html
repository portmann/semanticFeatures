UPDATE 1-Hermes unit, Canadian fund to buy stake in Associated British Ports | Reuters Related: Stocks, M&A, Markets, Financials March 31 (Reuters) - The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) and Hermes Infrastructure will buy a stake of at least 30 percent in Associated British Ports (ABP) for about 1.6 billion pounds ($2.4 billion). The deal, which is expected to close in the summer, will allow the buyers to acquire a further 3.33 percent in ABP, depending upon pre-emption rights, they said in a statement on Tuesday. Hermes Infrastructure, part of British-based fund Hermes Investment Management, and CPPIB will buy the ABP stake from GS Infrastructure Partners and Infracapital. Borealis infrastructure and Government of Singapore Investment Corp  will remain ABP shareholders. The price values the company at a multiple of about 20 times core earnings (EBITDA), based on 2014 figures and taking into account accrued earnings. That is less than other recent comparable transactions - Newcastle port, Australia's biggest coal export terminal, sold last year for 27 times earnings, although the commodity-rich country has more potential for growth. Infrastructure assets are attractive to companies like pension funds because of the long-term investment opportunity and stable returns that they represent. "The institutional investors we talk to still see infrastructure as very appealing," said Peter Hofbauer, head of Hermes Infrastructure. "It's locking in a real rate of return." It is the second infrastructure deal this month for Hermes, which along with another Canadian pension fund has agreed to pay 585 million pounds for a 40 percent stake in the Eurostar rail link. ABP had core earnings of 291.9 million pounds in 2013, and had a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of six percent between 2006 and 2013, Hofbauer said. ABP is run in the landlord model, whereby the owner of the port owns all the land and is the statutory authority of the business. That means the owner can make earnings simply from leasing the land, as well as bringing ships in and out and monitoring safety. "In the infrastructure business we don't yet have a port asset, and we like this landlord model," said Cressida Hogg, managing director and global head of infrastructure at CPPIB Macquarie Capital and Deutsche Bank acted as advisors to CPPIB and Hermes.
