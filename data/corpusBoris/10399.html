America's Water Infrastructure Problem | Seeking Alpha The analysis of water utilities on Seeking Alpha primarily focuses on the payout ratio. However, the cost to maintain aging US water infrastructure is increasing. The analysis of water utilities on Seeking Alpha primarily focuses on the payout ratio. However, cost recovery is important. Investors should look at how quickly a utility can recover the funds that it spends to repair aging pipes and to improve treatment plants. Cost recovery is especially important as the majority of the US water infrastructure is coming to the end of its useful life and as the cost to maintain this infrastructure is enormous (~$334.0 billion according to the EPA ). The payout ratio is the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends to shareholders. The payout ratio is a metric used to determine the sustainability of a company's dividend payments. A lower payout ratio is generally preferable to a higher payout ratio ( Investopedia ). The quotes presented below are from articles that focus on the payout ratio. The first quote is from the article "American Water Works (NYSE: AWK ), The Low Beta Hero." The second quote is from the article "Why You Should Invest in Water Utilities For Income." The last quote is from the article "Aqua America (NYSE: WTR ): Not A Buy At Current Prices." If we apply the current payout ratio of AWK shares of 54% to this estimate, we get an expected dividend for next year of $1.41 per share. Given both the company's recent history of dividend growth and the stability of its analyst estimates, I feel comfortable modeling for an unprecedented 4-cent dividend bump up from the current $0.31 per quarter to $0.35 per quarter ($1.40 per year) (LowBetaPortfolio). American Water Works has the lowest current dividend yield, but also has an impressive track record of long term dividend growth and the lowest payout ratio (StockMarketSherpa). They don't have much room to grow on the payout side. Close to 30% of net income has to be dedicated to fixed payments on their debt and that isn't changing anytime soon (Boyd). The payout ratio is important. However cost recovery is becoming an even more important metric. The US water infrastructure is coming to the end of its useful life in the next couple of decades ( Baird ). The majority of the US water infrastructure was built around 1945, after World War II, in response to the baby boomer population growth (Baird). Pipes constructed in this time period have a useful life of around ~75 years. Therefore, the pipes constructed in this time period will start to fail at nearly the same time over the next couple of decades for the reasons from age and corrosion (Baird). These costs to repair these failing pipes are enormous. The US Environmental Protection Agency estimates that these costs will amount to $334.8 billion over the 20 years (EPA). Quoted below is the EPA's letter to Congress: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's fourth national assessment of public water system infrastructure needs shows a total twenty-year capital improvement need of $334.8 billion. This estimate represents infrastructure projects necessary from January 1, 2007, through December 31, 2026, for water systems to continue to provide safe drinking water to the public. The national total comprises the infrastructure investment needs of the nation's approximately 52,000 community water systems and 21,400 not-for-profit non-community water systems, including the needs of American Indian and Alaskan Native Village water systems, and the costs associated with proposed and recently promulgated regulations (EPA). The Water Infrastructure Network, a consortium of industry, municipal and non-profit associations, estimates that as much as $1.0 trillion would be needed to sustain water and wastewater systems in the United States over the next two decades ( Baird ). The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) reiterates the one trillion price tag and is quoted below ( ASCE ). The American Society of Civil Engineers 2009 Report Card for America's Infrastructure gave a dismal score of D- to both our nation's drinking water and wastewater infrastructure. Most of the 2.8 million miles of pipe in need of repair and replacement was made in the last 50-75 years and has already exceeded its lifespan. It's estimated that up to one trillion dollars is needed over the next twenty years to replace this aging infrastructure (ASCE). An example of the magnitude of these costs is American Water Works, which plans to spend $5.4 billion in renewing its infrastructure from 2015-2019. This annualized capital expenditure spend of ~$1.4 billion is significantly more than its net income of ~1.0 billion ( AWK 10K ). Provided below, from 2014 AWK's 10K SEC filings, are the company's expected capital expenditure costs and key financial metrics (AWK 10K). Political Push-Back For Cost Recovery Industry operators have received a lot of political push-back on increasing rates to recover these high costs, therefore many water utilities are struggling with cost recovery. Utilities are constantly caught between needing to finance the high replacement costs of underground infrastructure and the political push-back resulting from rate increases and affordability issues. Therefore, most utilities list as their number one risk that they cannot adequately recover the cost of its invested capital. For example, American Water Work' lists cost recovery as its number one key risk, as shown below (picture taken from AWK's 10K). Similar literature could be found on California Water Service's 10K (NYSE: CWT ), Aqua America's 10K and America States Water's 10K (NYSE: AWR ). Water utilities that cannot adequately recover costs have seen stock offloaded by insiders. The prime example would be American Water Works. American Water Works generated a 5.4% return on its infrastructure-rated investments in 2014 (~$54.0 million in earnings accretion and ~1.0 billion in CapEx), much less than the typical 10.0% ROE hurdle required to attract capital (AWK 10K). As a result, AWK's management has unloaded around 80,328 shares (AWK SEC Form 4 Nasdaq ). Note: The insider buy activity is related to the execution of stock option to purchase shares at a discount, which are later offloaded. The pictures provided below are from Nasdaq. Water utilities that can fully recover costs have seen stock intensely purchased by insiders. The prime example would be Connecticut Water (NASDAQ: CTWS ). Connecticut Water generated a 10.3% return on its infrastructure rated investments in 2014 (~$3.1 million in earnings accretion and ~30.0 billion in CapEx(1)), at par with the typical 10.0% ROE hurdle required to attract capital ( 10K ). Therefore, management has purchased 27,048 shares (AWK SEC Form 4 Nasdaq). Provided below, from Nasdaq, is CTWS' insider transactions. US water infrastructure is coming to the end of its useful life and enormous costs are required for maintenance. There's a political push back to increase rates to keep water affordable. Therefore, the focus for the analysis of water utilities should migrate from the payout ratio to cost recovery.
