What Construction Spending Says About The Economy - SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSEARCA:DIA) | Seeking Alpha After crashing around a decade ago, construction spending has been on the rise, trying to get back to where it was previously. So far, the picture there is looking quite good, but some people are generally fearful about the state of the U.S. economy. Based on the data, though, barring external forces, there seems to be no basis in reality for this on any meaningful scale at the moment. Over the past few months, data relating to the U.S. economy has been mixed. After reporting that jobs grew (after adjustments), but just 11,000 in May, we saw a report touting 287,000 jobs added in June (compared to 175,000 anticipated), and as a result, some are now calling for GDP growth to be higher this year than expected. Overall, the data has been volatile and uncertain, but one key area that I believe shows how we're looking as a whole is construction spending. In what follows, I will dig into the most recent construction data I found and discuss what it means for market participants moving forward. So far this year, construction spending has been quite impressive. During the month of May, for instance, it came out to $1.14 trillion, an increase year over year of 2.8%. This is actually the highest construction spending for the month of May that we've seen since 2007, and is the third-highest on record. Using year-to-date data, construction spending so far this year is up 7.9%, having risen from $5.35 trillion to $5.77 trillion through May. In the graph below, you can see the trend that construction spending has taken dating back to 1993. Based on these findings, it's clear that the construction side of the U.S., which took a significant beating during the financial crisis, has rebounded nicely, and we seem to be on track (absent an economic downturn) to top prior highs. Of course, one fear investors might have, especially with home prices at record highs, is that we may be in another property bubble that could cause spending to fall again, especially if we tip into a recession. Fortunately, as the graph below indicates, while home prices are high and we may see a meaningful downturn there, private residential spending is nowhere near its highs. In fact, it seems to be private nonresidential spending (so everything not included in all the other categories shown in the graph) that has been faring well. Is it "good" spending or "bad" spending? What I find most interesting about this economic data is where the construction spending is concentrated. Some in economics believe there's such a thing as good or bad capital allocation, with anything private being good, while anything that's public (government-funded) is bad, since it came through taxes or will result in higher taxes or debt monetization in the future. With some exceptions, I disagree with this notion because, although some spending can be optimal or even create a negative value to society in the long run, I applaud the activity that most any form of spending creates. Having said this, even if my mode of thinking here is incorrect, the spending that we have seen recently has tilted much more heavily toward the "good" type (a.k.a. private spending). You see, in the graph below, data suggests that, while construction spending at the public level was more or less flat during the downturn, it was private spending that took a beating, falling by as much as 51.6% from February 2006 through January 2011. Over that particular time frame, public spending managed to increase by about 18%. The comeback from the bottom, however, has been driven nearly entirely by private spending, as the graph shows. What this suggests is that the private economy, which relies far more heavily on economic conditions than the government would in making decisions, is showing impressive signs of life. While public spending is up just 4.3% year over year through May, private spending has soared by 9.1%. This is lower than the massive surge we saw coming out of the downturn, but is approximately in line with the private spending growth seen from 2014 through 2015 (ending in May), when growth was 9.2%. Based on the data I have, it seems fairly certain that the construction side of the economy is quite healthy, if we use construction spending as a barometer for its health. Though growth may not be quite as large as in the past, it is comparable to last year's performance thus far. This does not mean that we won't see a recession, but even if we do, it's likely that it's still a ways off or that it will be small (the 2001 recession did not show up in any material way in the private spending data). This is due to the fact that private construction spending did not begin to contract until March 2006 leading into the crisis, and even then, we weren't officially in a recession until December 2007. One critique I do have is that I'd like to see more public spending to add to the activity, but even seeing the nice surge that we have in private spending is appealing and suggests that, although it's very possible that markets are pricey at the moment, there doesn't appear to be any meaningful risk of a downturn related to this industry.
