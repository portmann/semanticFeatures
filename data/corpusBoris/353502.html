Housing, transportation and food has driven much of the rise in household spending in recent years, leaving families with less financial wiggle room. Photo: CASEY RODGERS/INVISION FOR ALDI/ASSOCIATED PRESS U.S. household spending has fully recovered since the latest recession, but income hasn’t, squeezing budgets and pushing many lower-income families into the red, according to a Pew Charitable TrustsÂ report out Wednesday. “The lack of financial flexibility threatens low-income householdsâ€™ financial security in the short term and their economic mobility in the long term,” the reportÂ said. Pew tracked inflation-adjusted expenditures and incomes Â of working-age Americans, ages 20 to 60, from 1996 to 2014. The results show the downturn and recovery for spending in the aftermath ofÂ the 2007-09 recession but also highlight stagnating incomes (including wages, government benefits and transfers, pensions, child support and other sources). The study helps illustrate broader economic themes, including a slow recovery underpinned by steady job creation and rising Â  consumerÂ spending , alongside paltry wage growth and growingÂ income inequality. Pew found that as of 2014, median income before taxes had fallen by 13% from a decade earlier, while expenditures had increased by nearly 14%. That left families across the income spectrum with fewer funds for savings and investment in things like education. Housing, transportation and food drove much of the rise in spending, leaving families with less financial wiggle room. Low-income families may not see much of an alternative to spending more on shelter, commuting costs and putting food on the table. “That increase in the cost for shelter is a really important piece about why families at the bottom don’t feel financially stable,” said Erin Currier, director of the financial security and mobility project at Pew. “So many families are walking a financial tightropeâ€”their core needs are getting more expensive and incomes aren’t rising to meet those costs.” That’s left many running a personal budget deficit despite spending less on restaurants, entertainment and other discretionary goods and services. Pew’s analysis found that in 2004, a typical household in the lower third had $1,500 left over after expenses. By 2014, such households were $2,300 in the red. It’s not clear from the survey where families turn to make up the gap, though savings, family and friends, and credit are among the possibilities. Earners in the top third had median income of about $44,915 after expenses in 2004 and $33,414 in 2014. The typical household in the middle third dropped from $17,000 in 2004 to $5,944 in 2014.
