null BRASILIA, June 14 Brazil is considering making a proposed spending cap temporary rather than permanent, two government sources told Reuters on Tuesday, in what could indicate interim President Michel Temer is tempering one of his main plans to reduce debt. Finance Minister Henrique Meirelles told Reuters on June 2 the government would implement a permanent spending cap, via a constitutional amendment, to plug a massive budget deficit in a country struggling to regain investors' confidence. However, to facilitate congressional approval the government is discussing putting a time limit on the ceiling that ties annual primary expenditures' growth to the previous year's inflation rate, the sources said. Primary expenditures exclude spending on interest payments. "The government continues to discuss the amendment... the finance ministry proposal should not be the final one," said one official who is familiar with the matter. Temer is expected to unveil the final proposal to lawmakers Wednesday. The official, who asked for anonymity because he is not allowed to speak publicly, said the ministry is proposing setting a time limit of 20 years that could be changed after six years. Temer's chief of staff, Eliseu Padilha, wants a shorter time limit and will meet with other officials later on Tuesday to settle the issue, said another government official briefed on the matter. "Finding a balance will be both an economic and financial exercise with political realities involved," Gersan Zurita, senior vice-president of Moody's Investor Service in Brazil said in an interview. "If the term is too short it may not be realistic, but then if it is too long it is not credible because you send signals that you are not serious about strengthening your accounts." Moody's as well as its rival credit rating agencies stripped Brazil of its hard-won investment grade rating last year because of the rapid deterioration of the country's public finances. A time limit may be seen as a setback for Meirelles, a former Wall Street banker widely respected by investors, who was expected to have absolute control over economic policy. A spokeswoman for the Finance Ministry said it would only comment on the spending ceiling after the proposal details are made public. Local media Tuesday said the government could seek a time limit of as little as eight years or tie the spending cap to a reduction in the country's debt burden. The constitutional amendment requires three-fifths approval from the legislature. The government has also extended talks with union leaders for a pension reform, which is seen as key to rebalance fiscal accounts. A formal pension reform proposal may not be sent to Congress before July, Padilha said Monday. Two other government officials have told Reuters the pension reform proposal would only be submitted to Congress should the Senate convict suspended President Dilma Rousseff in coming months of breaking budgetary laws and remove her from office. Rousseff was suspended from office in mid-May, clearing the way for Temer, the vice-president, to become interim president.
