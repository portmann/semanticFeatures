Wait For A Pullback To Buy Dunkin' Brands - Dunkin' Brands (NASDAQ:DNKN) | Seeking Alpha Dunkin' Brandsâ€™ comparable-store-sales growth have been reasonably good compared to its peers. Despite unfavorable conditions, Dunkin' Brands posted solid results in fiscal first quarter. U.S. consumer sentiment has been strengthening lately amid improving labor market. Ideally, it should help consumer discretionary stocks as improving macroeconomic environment would spur consumer spending. So, I thought that it would be a good time to look at some quick service restaurant stocks. After my analysis, I found Dunkin' Brands Group (NASDAQ: DNKN ) as a decent story although the company looks fairly valued at current levels. In my opinion, though a slight pullback in DNKN shares in the near-term would make it an attractive opportunity. Dunkin' Brands has one of the best comparable-store-sales records. Comparable-store-sales--- a key performance metric in the restaurant industry as it leaves out the impact of unusual sales arising from stores opened less than 12 month ago during a fiscal year--- rose at a decent pace for Dunkin' Brands even as other fast food giants such as McDonald's (NYSE: MCD ) struggled. Comparable-store-sales at Dunkin' Donuts (U.S. segment) rose 3.4% in fiscal 2013 and 1.6% in fiscal 2014. Comparable-store-sales at Baskin-Robbins (U.S. segment) edged up 0.8% in fiscal 2013 and climbed 4.7% in fiscal 2014. In comparison, McDonald's comparable-store-sales in the U.S. declined 1.6% in fiscal 2013 and fell 2.1% in fiscal 2014. Panera Bread's same-store-sales rose 1.4% at its company- owned stores and gained 0.9% at its franchise owned stores in fiscal 2014. Comparable-store-sales in the international segment were disappointing last year though. Dunkin' Donuts comparable-store-sales declined 2%, while Baskin Robbins' comparable-store-sales slipped 1.2%. This was due to weakness in Japan and South Korea. Nonetheless, it has shown a very good recovery in the recently concluded quarter. In the first quarter of 2015, Dunkin' Donuts' international comparable-store-sales rose 1.7%, up from 2.4% decline in the same quarter of last year. Baskin Robbins international comparable-store-sales edged up 0.3% in the first quarter. In the U.S., comparable-store-sales at Dunkin' Donuts rose 2.7%, year-over-year while comparable-store-sales at Baskin Robbins climbed 8%, year-over-year in the fiscal first quarter. The company posted solid results at a time when the U.S. restaurant industry was challenged by unfavorable weather conditions. Sales of K-Cups have been strong in the recent past. Nevertheless, sales of Dunkin' Brands' own K-Cups have not been encouraging. While Keurig Green Mountain's K-Cup sales climbed 13% in fiscal 2014, Dunkin' Brand's K-Cup sales fell by more than double digit percentage points in fiscal fourth quarter of 2014.PoorK-Cup sales had a significant negative impact on Dunkin' Brands' comparable-store-sales in the fourth of 2014. Sales of K-Cups were weak due to Dunkin''s ineffective distribution strategy. Fearing cannibalization of its K-Cup's restaurant sales, Dunkin' Brands avoided selling brewed coffee pods through other channels such as supermarkets---- where the demand has been strong. However, Dunkin' Brands took a major step forward earlier this year. It announced reaching an agreement with the J.M. Smucker Company (NYSE: SJM ) and Keurig Green Mountain (NASDAQ: GMCR ) to make its K-Cups available at thousands of retail outlets throughout the U.S. and Canada. According to the agreement, J.M. Smucker will distribute Dunkin' K-Cups in grocery chains, dollar stores, club stores and many other channels while Keurig will market and distribute it to specialty stores and office superstores. In the fiscal quarter of 2015, Dunkin''s operating income climbed 21.2% to $14.6 million, year-over-year, mainly due to its K-Cup pack licensing agreement and higher royalty income. DNKN not only beat first-quarter estimates but also raised guidance for the full year. That said DNKN shares look fairly valued at current level. DNKN shares have gained more than 23% so far this year and are hovering near 52-week high levels. In terms of valuation, DNKN now trades at 32x trailing twelve months (TTM) earnings and 7.04x TTM sales. I think that a 6%-8% pullback in the near-term would offer an attractive entry point for DNKN. Investors have to also keep in mind that Dunkin' Brands operates in a very competitive landscape. It generates bulk of the revenue from its U.S. operations. The quick service restaurant is probably one of the most fiercely competitive sectors within the restaurant industry in the U.S. with no barriers to entry. Dunkin' Brands not only competes with big players like Wendy's (NASDAQ: WEN ), McDonald's, Yum Brands' (NYSE: YUM ) Taco Bell chains but also with private players such as Dairy Queen, Cold Stone Creamery and Quick Trip. Hence, it will have to constantly bring innovations in its marketing efforts and keep improving its breakfast and beverage menu to stay ahead of its competitors. Further, fast-food chains, especially in the U.S., face growing risk from changing consumer health and dietary preferences. As increasing number of Americans switch to organic food from high-carbs diet, it will be a challenge for chains such as Dunkin' Brands to attract traffic. Lower traffic could result into loss of sales and profitability for DNKN's franchisees, which in turn could negatively impact Dunkin' Brands' revenues from royalty fees. So, this is one area, which in my opinion needs to be closely watched if you are taking a long-term bet on DNKN.
