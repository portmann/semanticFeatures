Eros: Return Of The Short Seller (2015) - Eros International Plc (NYSE:EROS) | Seeking Alpha We previously reported symptoms of deceit at Eros. We will now illustrate what we believe to be pervasive accounting deception related to the company’s revenue figures. Eros has overstated the number of movies it has distributed by 124% and 200% during fiscal years 2014 and 2015, respectively. Our comprehensive list of movies is provided below. We believe that Eros has overstated its theatrical revenue by 82% and 104% during fiscal years 2014 and 2015, respectively. We challenge the company to provide a complete list of movies it has distributed during fiscal years 2014 and 2015. Two weeks ago, we published a story on Eros International PLC (NYSE: EROS ) ("Eros") titled, Unlike the Name, Investors Should Not Love EROS . In our prior article, we raised a number of troubling questions about the company's accounting, such as its growing account receivable balances and its subsidiary's financials that made no sense. Now, we will illustrate how we believe that there is pervasive deception at the company which starts with the most basic of numbers: the film count and the revenues. Eros claims to have distributed 134 films in the last two fiscal years: 65 films in the fiscal year 2015 and 69 in the fiscal year 2014. Through an extensive research process, we have concluded that Eros actually distributed less than half the number of films as compared to what it claims. Our best estimate is that Eros distributed 52 films during this two-year period. Below is a chart of the company's reported film production numbers: Eros does not disclose the names of all of its films, which if our assertions are correct, is obviously something it cannot do since it would not have produced the claimed number of films. This made our research project of identifying the number of films distributed by Eros more difficult. We broke our project into a few steps. First, we employed the service of a consultant to compile a complete list of movies and the associated box office revenue. Our consultant informed us that there are three companies (Scrabble Entertainment, UFO Moviez India, and Qube Cinema Network/Real Image) that digitize and deliver 100% of Indian movies to the cinemas. These three companies combined should have a complete list of films released by Eros and all other major distributors/producers. By analyzing the list of films released through the digitization services, our consultant compiled a list of 19 movies released by Eros in India during each of fiscal years 2015 and 2014. Investors can replicate much of this work by searching through the publicly available library of films on UFO Moviez ( Source ). Second, we went through a laborious process to determine any remaining universe of movies associated with Eros. We reviewed film lists from International Movie Database, Box Office India, Box Office Mojo, and Movie Buff, which are the leading websites that compile movie data (Sources here , here , here , and here ). Through these sites, we identified six and three additional movies distributed by Eros in fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our understanding is that these movies might not be on the first list if Eros was not involved at the outset. Instead, for these movies, Eros served primarily as a financing or distributing partner for the producer, securing rights to the film only after it had been produced and digitized and sent to the theaters for release. We then identified all 154 movies on ErosNow that were released between 2013 and 2015. We reviewed movie posters for each of these movies looking for the Eros logo to determine which were distributed by Eros. As can be seen in the picture below, when Eros distributes a movie, it puts its logo on the poster: It would make no sense for Eros to have the rights to films and not place the film on ErosNow. In addition to the other 47 movies we previously identified, our review of the posters of movies on ErosNow identifying Eros as the distributor revealed an additional two and one movies during each of fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively. Lastly, we reviewed the film slate on Eros International Media Limited's Earning Releases. We found two additional movies that were released during the fiscal year 2015. Some films, like Gang Bang, were slated for production in Eros International Media Limited's Earning Releases. However, no mention of these films' ultimate release could be found. We have excluded these films from our movie list. In other cases, Eros International Media Limited's film slate included unnamed films as seen below. Perhaps Eros was distributing so few films that it felts the need to bolster its slate, even though it claimed the list was not exhaustive ( Source ). In summary, there were just 29 movies for the fiscal year 2015 and 23 movies for the fiscal year 2014 that could be identified using our exhaustive process. We challenge the company to identify the other 82 films it claims to have distributed during fiscal years 2014 and 2015. Our exhaustive investigation leads us to believe that Eros distributed less than half as many movies as it claims to have distributed. Based on our research, Eros appears to have overstated its fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015 theatrical revenues by at least 82% and 104%, respectively. Eros claims that it generated $123 million of theatrical revenue during fiscal 2015, but our research from publicly available sources reveals that actual theatrical revenue was only $60 million, an overstatement of 104% of its actual revenue. Even if we missed films in our analysis, it is unlikely that any of the missed films would have been a material contributor to revenue. We believe our figures are generous. Five of the twenty-seven films listed above are Tamil films. Revenue from Tamil films is not tracked independently and our research has indicated that there is frequently revenue exaggeration for Tamil films ( Source ). We also gave Eros full credit for Kochadaiiyaan. This movie was a Tamil blockbuster, but Eros only participated in the less lucrative Hindi release. Our research has shown that the Hindi version did very poorly and was a financial disaster, but we cannot find a source that precisely divides the film's revenues between its Hindi and Tamil versions. We challenge the company to publicly release the revenues it earned from its supposed 134 films released in the past two years. In trying to justify the high levels of overseas revenue it books, Eros claims that the contribution from India is just 50-55% of its total revenues, regardless of in which geography the revenue is booked. However, according to the 19 Eros films tracked on Box Office India, 88% of the gross box office for these films was earned in India in the fiscal year 2015, as can be seen in the following chart. This seems to significantly contradict the company's claims regarding in which geography it earns its revenue. Likewise, KPMG, in its "Indian Media and Entertainment Industry Report" suggests a similar conclusion ( Source ). It breaks out the revenue sources of the Indian Film Industry as follows: If one were to absurdly assume that Home Video, Cable and Satellite Rights, and Ancillary Revenue Streams all come from outside India, Indian revenue would still be 74% of the total for the calendar year 2014. Looking just at the theatrical revenues for the Indian film industry, KPMG estimates that 92% of the revenue comes from India. Thus, Eros' claim that only 50-55% of its revenue is derived from India seems implausible given the market in which it operates. We imagine that it is undoubtedly easier to book fake transactions in tax-free jurisdictions like the UAE, BVI, and Mauritius with tiny auditors than it is to fool Grant Thornton in India. In a similar situation, we would note that Globo Plc was just caught deceiving Grant Thornton in a fraud ( Source ). Thus, the difference between industry norm levels of overseas revenues and Eros' level of overseas revenue is most likely due to invalid and forged transactions booked in exotic jurisdictions like the Isle of Man and the United Arab Emirates. When a company fakes its revenue, it needs to find a way to keep its financial statements balanced. The easiest way to do this is to create fake accounts receivable, which is then usually reflected in a rising Days Sales Outstanding ("DSO"). In Eros' case, its DSO has increased steadily over each of the past five years, including the most recent quarter (based off of LTM Revenue). During fiscal years 2015 and 2014, Eros reported revenue from television syndication of $101 million and $80 million, respectively. Eros also claims to have earned $60 million and $48 million in digital and ancillary revenue in fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively. We cross-referenced Eros' revenue derived from television and digital to KPMG's Report ( Source ). Using the average foreign exchange rate, the entire Indian Film Industry earned $241 million from Cable and Satellite Rights and $158 million from Digital and Ancillary in 2014, according to KPMG. Eros' reported revenue implies 42% and 38% market share of the industry's total Cable and Satellite Rights and the industry's total Digital and Ancillary revenue, respectively. These levels of penetration seem implausible based on the much smaller proportion of gross box office receipts represented by Eros' reported theatrical revenues (which we have shown appear to be inflated to start with). Indeed, Eros only accounted for 15-19% of the industry's revenue from theatrical sources over the past four years. If one were to use our more reasonable theatrical revenue calculations, the box office of films distributed by Eros would represent just 9% of the total market. Furthermore, according to KPMG, industry revenue from Television Syndication rights declined from 2013 to 2014. In contrast, Eros reported 26% growth in revenue from Television Syndication rights over a similar period. We find it implausible that Eros was able to grow its market share of Television Syndication rights by 11% points between fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015 when its box office market share was up only 3% points (or up 0.5% points based on our calculated results). When compared to our more reasonable estimates of the company's actual revenues from theatrical distribution, its reported Television Syndication rights revenues look even more exaggerated. The company gives no justification for its abnormally high market share in Television Syndication rights and Digital and Ancillary revenues. We believe the justification is simple: the shares of Television Syndication rights and Digital and Ancillary revenues are fictional. WHEN YOU ARE CAUGHT? DENY, DISTRACT, AND DISCREDIT Eros' management was caught with its pants down last week. So to keep their gravy train going, they employed time-honored tactics of denying their misdeeds, distracting investors with irrelevant data, and trying to discredit the critic and its data. They also made some bold promises, which appear unlikely to come true. The company states that the receivable growth is a combination of $50 million from sales growth and $31.2 million from the extension of payment terms to customers. There is no reason why 100% of Eros' reported revenue growth should occur without any increase in cash collections. Furthermore, there is no explanation for why payment terms were extended. The company states that its receivables will decrease to $150-160 million by the end of the fiscal year 2016. We remain skeptical. Previous long investor Knight Assets & Co. was "assured by management" that the company's receivables position would decline. Knight Assets & Co. has since sold its long position in mid-October after management's promises never came to fruition ( Source ). The company also points to the age of the receivables and claims that only $6 million of the receivables are over twelve months old. Receivable aging can be easily manipulated through tactics such as renegotiating receivables or paying old receivables with new ones. We believe that the cash (or lack thereof) tells the real story. Management also tries to distract investors by pointing to the company's dominance in markets such as Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Russia, Africa, Poland and Indonesia. This is simply a tactic to cloud the issues at hand by adding additional geographies for investors to consider as potentially "big" markets for Eros to exploit. Furthermore, for many of these markets, Eros uses a sub-distributor, meaning that the revenue Eros would be due from these countries is probably immaterial. We believe that discussing these tiny markets for Indian content is just a distraction from the real issue: Eros is possibly booking fake revenue. Eros believes that its amortization policy is more conservative than its U.S. counterparts. Eros says that its amortization period should be longer than its U.S. counterparts due to a longer revenue "tail" because the Indian media and entertainment sector is growing rapidly. There are multiple problems with that argument. First, the company can believe whatever it likes, but it doesn't change the fact that its amortization policy is significantly longer than the amortization policies at Dreamworks (NASDAQ: DWA ), MGM Studios, and Twenty-First Century Fox (NASDAQ: FOX ) (NASDAQ: FOXA ) ( Source ). In addition, the "tail," which is the value attributed to a film after it leaves the box office, comes from the home entertainment and TV markets. Therefore, in order to properly match the recognition of revenues and expenses, more mature markets such as the U.S. and Europe, with more developed home entertainment supply chains and lower levels of piracy, should use longer amortization periods than markets like India ( Source ). In contrast, companies in markets that depend more on box office revenues, like India, need to use faster amortization periods to properly match revenues and expenses. Of note, there was a prior transaction in which a Hollywood studio acquired an Indian film production company and determined that the fair value of the acquired company's "tail" was much smaller than the value at which it was being carried by its prior Indian owner. Disney (NYSE: DIS ) acquired UTV, an Indian film production and distribution company, in 2012. Subsequent to that acquisition, Disney had to take significant balance sheet write downs that resulted in earnings losses during 2012 and 2013 ( Source ). Eros claims it has very little exposure to flops due to television pre-sales, a modest budget, and lower advertising costs relative to Hollywood films. As seems to be the trend with Eros, the truth is an entirely different matter. Based on data from Koimoi, only two of Eros' 32 films with worldwide distribution rights released in fiscal years 2014 and 2015 have been hits. In contrast to its assertions, Eros has distributed one losing film and eight flops during the last two fiscal years (Source: 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 ). Koimoi defines a flop as a film which loses 50% or more of the investment and a losing film as one that does not recover the investment but loses less than 50% of it. We think it is implausible that Eros is not recognizing impairments on its films with so many flops and losing films. When addressing its international subsidiaries, Eros says that it consolidates its subsidiaries and that as a result, any intercompany transactions get canceled out. This explanation is inadequate. It doesn't address how an entity can have an increase in receivables equal to 120% of revenue booked. Nor does it explain why on a consolidated level, the questionable subsidiaries in locales such as the UAE are growing so quickly while not collecting receivables. In response to a question about its capital spending relative to the production mix, Eros claims capital spending is incurred over a three-year period, making it impossible to directly tie any specific year's capital spending to the year's film slate. Further, the company claims that there are expenditures related to ErosNow in the fiscal year 2015. In essence, Eros is saying that investors should not extrapolate what an appropriate level of CapEx should be based solely on the number of high, medium, and low budget films distributed in a given year. We have trouble believing this assertion given the fact that Eros released 16% fewer films in the fiscal year 2015 than it did in the fiscal year 2013, yet the company's capital spending was 48% higher in fiscal 2015. Regarding its assertion that there are capital expenditures related to ErosNow, we would note that ErosNow was launched in the fiscal year 2012 and we see no disclosure from the company to indicate that there was any acceleration in capital spending related to ErosNow during fiscal year 2015. Regarding free cash flow, the company is proud of the $32.7 million in free cash flow that it generated during the fiscal year 2010. However, Eros fails to address the negative free cash flow generated every year thereafter. Eros also brags about the $388 million in operating cash flow that it has delivered during the past three years, but the company fails to mention its $626 million in capital spending over the same period. The company also ignores the fact that it employed a small accounting firm to audit its largest global subsidiaries, instead choosing to highlight Grand Thornton India as its auditor for the parent company. In our view, this does not preclude Eros from perpetuating a scam. Importantly, the company does not explicitly state that Grant Thornton India LLP audits the subsidiaries. Instead, Eros loosely implies this by saying "Grant Thornton… performs the audit of the company's consolidated financial statements, which includes its subsidiaries." In reality, one of Eros' subsidiaries is now using a new, apparently tiny auditor named Jayesh Sheth & Co. after the prior one resigned (Source here and here ). As we pointed out in our previous Seeking Alpha article , the former auditor who resigned, Anil Jagetiya & Co., may have resigned from the nine subsidiaries it was auditing. Jayesh Sheth & Co. may be auditing all nine subsidiaries now. Eros states that related party transactions are all disclosed publicly. While this may be okay for reporting purposes, the level of related party transactions should be a massive red flag for investors. Management fails to disclose why an executive's mother owns 99% of Next Gen Films, a company with no employees, and why Next Gen received 9%, 14% and 13% of Eros's capital spending during fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The company now states that it hopes to have a few million ErosNow paying subscribers worldwide over a three- to five-year horizon that will contribute significantly to revenue and EBITDA in the long run. This is quite different than the grand-standing management did at the FBR Digital Media Thought Leaders Conference on October 8, 2015 ( Source : Beginning at 32:00). During its "fireside chat," management stated an aspiration of having 100 million subscribers paying $1 per month with virtually zero costs, or close $1.2 billion going straight to EBITDA. Further, if the company wanted investors to view ErosNow as a free option, it makes no sense that there were fifty-four slides from its Analyst Day devoted to ErosNow compared to just twenty-seven slides to discuss its base business. Management also called attention to the fact that Eros was a distributor of eight of the top fifteen films for the calendar year 2015, including two out of the top three grossing films. That would be great if those films led to cash profits. Based on our research, however, only two of these eight films were profitable, Bajrangi Bhaijaan and Tanu Weds Manu Returns. Incidentally, while both of these films were calendar year 2015 releases, neither are in the fiscal 2015 revenue numbers as they were released after March 31, 2015. We also find it misleading for the company to provide a chart with the gross box office receipts. Eros, as the distributor, only keeps about 40% of the gross box office receipts. Further, for three of those eight films, Eros only has control over the international distribution, which is a small fraction of the Indian box office receipts. In other cases, Eros does not receive the TV and Digital Rights, which we believe was the case with Bajrangi Bhaijaan. Salman Khan appears to have retained those rights, not Eros. When a company commits a scam, the symptoms often run throughout its financials. Last week, we highlighted the symptoms at Eros but did not show the genesis of the potential scam. Since our first article, we have continued with our extensive research project and we now show that Eros appears to have over-reported the number of movies it released as well as the theatrical revenues it earned from these movies. Even if we missed some smaller, regional films, the public sources we utilized should have identified Eros' most important films, which we believe account for all of Eros' meaningful revenue. Furthermore, the sources of Eros' revenue are disproportionate to industry averages and public numbers. Relative to the market in which it operates, the company has too much revenue originating from Overseas as well as from TV Syndication and Digital and Ancillary sources. Our research strongly suggests that Eros is yet another scam being perpetrated on investors. Unless management changes its historical approach to transparency and is able to provide support for the number of distributed films and the company's revenues, we feel that this Bollywood story will have a very bad ending.
