U.S. Senate Democrats block defense spending bill | Reuters Related: Regulatory News, Bonds, Markets, Mutual Fund Center WASHINGTON, Sept 22 Democrats blocked the fiscal 2016 defense spending bill in the U.S. Senate on Tuesday, amid a fierce fight with Republicans over tax and spending policy days before a potential Oct. 1 government shutdown. As voting continued, the vote was 53-41, largely along party lines with Republicans voting yes and Democrats no. It meant the appropriations measure failed to achieve the 60-vote majority needed to advance to final passage.
