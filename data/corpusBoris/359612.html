Norway rejects proposal of investing wealth fund in infrastructure | Reuters OSLO Norway's $850-billion sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, should not be allowed to invest in unlisted infrastructure projects, the government said on Tuesday in its annual white paper. The central bank, which manages the fund, had recommended that it should be allowed to invest in infrastructure. The fund currently invests about 60 percent of its value in stocks, 35 percent in bonds and up to five percent in real estate, all outside Norway. In the future, allocations in real estate could rise to 7 percent, the government said. (This story corrects final paragraph to show that future allocation to real estate, not infrastructure, could reach 7 percent) Thomson Reuters is the world's largest international multimedia news agency, providing investing news , world news , business news , technology news , headline news, small business news , news alerts, personal finance , stock market , and mutual funds information available on Reuters.com, video , mobile , and interactive television platforms.
