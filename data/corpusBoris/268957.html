UPDATE 1-U.S. Congress nears passage of major fiscal measures | Reuters WASHINGTON Dec 18 The U.S. Congress neared completion of sweeping tax and budget legislation on Friday that will stave off the threat of government shutdowns for most of next year and boost military and domestic spending while giving the oil industry the gift of crude exports. Lawmakers were rushing to finish a $1.15 trillion bill to fund the government through September 2016, as well as a package of $680 billion in tax breaks over 10 years. Embedded in the spending bill is the removal of a 40-year-old ban on U.S. oil exports. In return for the Republican initiative, Democrats extracted concessions including tax incentives for wind and solar energy industries. The House of Representatives and Senate planned to act in rapid succession before adjourning for the year, and President Barack Obama has said he would sign the measures into law. Before launching into a series of votes on the spending bill, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi attempted to rush a bill aiding Puerto Rico onto the House floor, but was blocked by Republican leadership. Pelosi told reporters that early next year she will continue trying to advance a 90-day "stay of liability" in the island's debt-crisis.
