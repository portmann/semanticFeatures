Dangerous Speech: Would The Founders Be Considered Domestic Extremists Today? | Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! Some traders think having good risk management in place is an edge, but there is a distinction to be made here. Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! Submitted by John Whitehead via The Rutherford Institute, Not only has free speech become a four-letter word - profane, obscene, uncouth, not to be uttered in so-called public places - but in more and more cases, the government deems free speech to be downright dangerous and in some instances illegal. The U.S. government has become particularly intolerant of speech that challenges the government’s power, reveals the government’s corruption, exposes the government’s lies, and encourages the citizenry to push back against the government’s many injustices. Indeed, there is a long and growing list of the kinds of speech that the government considers dangerous enough to red flag and subject to censorship, surveillance, investigation and prosecution: hate speech, bullying speech, intolerant speech, conspiratorial speech, treasonous speech, threatening speech, incendiary speech, inflammatory speech, radical speech, anti-government speech, right-wing speech, extremist speech, etc. Yet by allowing the government to whittle away at cherished First Amendment freedoms - which form the backbone of the Bill of Rights - we have evolved into a society that would not only be abhorrent to the founders of this country but would be hostile to the words they used to birth this nation. Conduct your own experiment into the government’s tolerance of speech that challenges its authority, and see for yourself. Stand on a street corner—or in a courtroom, at a city council meeting or on a university campus—and recite some of the rhetoric used by the likes of Thomas Jefferson, Patrick Henry, John Adams and Thomas Paine without referencing them as the authors. For that matter, just try reciting the Declaration of Independence , which rejects tyranny, establishes Americans as sovereign beings, recognizes God as a Supreme power, portrays the government as evil, and provides a detailed laundry list of abuses that are as relevant today as they were 240 years ago. My guess is that you won’t last long before you get thrown out, shut up, threatened with arrest or at the very least accused of being a radical, a troublemaker, a sovereign citizen, a conspiratorialist or an extremist. Try suggesting, as Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin did, that Americans should not only take up arms but be prepared to shed blood in order to protect their liberties, and you might find yourself placed on a terrorist watch list and vulnerable to being rounded up by government agents. “What country can preserve its liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance. Let them take arms,” declared Jefferson. He also concluded that “the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.” Observed Franklin: “Democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch. Liberty is a well-armed lamb contesting the vote!” Better yet, try suggesting as Thomas Paine, Marquis De Lafayette, John Adams and Patrick Henry did that Americans should, if necessary, defend themselves against the government if it violates their rights, and you will be labeled a domestic extremist. “It is the duty of the patriot to protect his country from its government,” insisted Paine. “When the government violates the people’s rights,” Lafayette warned, “insurrection is, for the people and for each portion of the people, the most sacred of the rights and the most indispensable of duties.” Adams cautioned, “A settled plan to deprive the people of all the benefits, blessings and ends of the contract, to subvert the fundamentals of the constitution, to deprive them of all share in making and executing laws, will justify a revolution.” And who could forget Patrick Henry with his ultimatum: “Give me liberty or give me death!” Then again, perhaps you don’t need to test the limits of free speech for yourself. One such test is playing out before our very eyes in Portland, Oregon, where radio “shock jock” Pete Santilli, a new media journalist who broadcasts his news reports over YouTube and streaming internet radio, is sitting in jail. Santilli, notorious for his controversial topics, vocal outrage over government abuses, and inflammatory rhetoric, is not what anyone would consider an objective reporter. His radio show, aptly titled “Telling You the Truth...Whether You Like It or Not,” makes it clear that Santilli has a viewpoint (namely, that the government has overstepped its bounds), and he has no qualms about sharing it with his listeners. In early January 2016, a group of armed activists, reportedly protesting the federal government’s management of federal lands and its prosecution of two local ranchers convicted of arson, staged an act of civil disobedience by occupying the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Burns, Oregon. Santilli, who has covered such protests in the past, including the April 2014 standoff in Nevada between the Bundy ranching family and the federal government over grazing rights, reported on the occupation in Burns as an embedded journalist, albeit one who was sympathetic to the complaints (although not the tactics) of the occupiers. When asked to clarify his role in relation to the occupation, Santilli declared, “My role is the same here that it was at the Bundy ranch. To talk about the constitutional implications of what is going on here. The Constitution cannot be negotiated .” Long a thorn in the side of the FBI, Santilli was arrested by the FBI following its ambush and arrest of key leaders of the movement. He was charged, along with the armed resistors, with conspiracy to impede federal officers from discharging their duties by use of force, intimidation, or threats—the same charge being levied against those who occupied the refuge—which carries a maximum sentence of six years in prison . Notably, Santilli is the only journalist among those covering the occupation to be charged with conspiracy , despite the fact that he did not participate in the takeover of the refuge, nor did he ever spend a night on the grounds of the refuge, nor did he ever represent himself as anything but a journalist covering the occupation. Of course, the government doesn’t actually believe that 50-year-old Santilli is an accomplice to any criminal activity. Read between the lines and you’ll find that what the government is really accusing Santilli of is employing dangerous speech. As court documents indicate , the government is prosecuting Santilli solely as a reporter of information. In other words, they’re making an example of him, which is consistent with the government’s ongoing efforts to intimidate members of the media who portray the government in a less than favorable light. During the protests in Ferguson, Missouri, and Baltimore, Maryland, numerous journalists were arrested while covering the regions’ civil unrest and the conditions that spawned that unrest. These attempts to muzzle the press were clearly concerted, top-down efforts to restrict the fundamental First Amendment rights of the public and the press. The Obama administration's treatment of reporters has caused controversy before. In 2009, the Department of Justice  targeted  a Fox News reporter  in an investigation. Three years later, DOJ  seized Associated Press reporters’ phone records . After that, former Attorney General Eric Holder  ordered a review  of the Justice Department's news media policies. DOJ employees must  consult  with a unit within the Criminal Division before they arrest someone when there is a “question regarding whether an individual or entity is a ‘member of the news media,’” according to a January 2015  memo  from Holder to DOJ employees.” That the government is choosing to target Santilli for prosecution, despite the fact that they do not recognize new media journalists as members of the mainstream media , signals a broadening of the government’s efforts to suppress what it considers dangerous speech and stamp out negative coverage. The message is clear: whether a journalist is acting alone or is affiliated with an established news source, the government has no qualms about subjecting them to harassment, arrest, jail time and trumped up charges if doing so will discourage others from openly opposing or exposing the government. You see, the powers-that-be understand that if the government can control speech, it controls thought and, in turn, it can control the minds of the citizenry. Where the government has gone wrong is in hinging its case against Santilli based solely on his incendiary rhetoric, which is protected by the First Amendment and which bears a striking resemblance to disgruntled patriots throughout American history. Here’s what Santilli said: “What we need, most importantly, is one hundred thousand unarmed men and women to stand together. It is the most powerful weapon in our arsenal .” Now compare that with the call to action from Joseph Warren, a leader of the Sons of Liberty and a principal figure within the American Revolution: “Stain not the glory of your worthy ancestors, but like them resolve never to part with your birthright; be wise in your deliberations, and determined in your exertions for the preservation of your liberties. Follow not the dictates of passion, but enlist yourselves under the sacred banner of reason; use every method in your power to secure your rights.”  Santilli: “ I’m not armed . I am armed with my mouth. I’m armed with my live stream. I’m armed with a coalition of like-minded individuals who sit at home and on YouTube watch this.” Now compare that to what George Washington had to say: “Unhappy it is, though, to reflect that a brother's sword has been sheathed in a brother's breast and that the once-happy plains of America are either to be drenched with blood or inhabited by slaves. Sad alternative! But can a virtuous man hesitate in his choice?” And then there was Andrew Jackson, a hothead if ever there was one. He came of age in the early days of the republic, served as the seventh president of the United States, and was not opposed to shedding blood when necessary: “Peace, above all things, is to be desired, but blood must sometimes be spilled to obtain it on equable and lasting terms.” There have always been those willing to speak their minds despite the consequences. Where freedom hangs in the balance is when “we the people” are called on to stand with or against individuals who actually exercise their rights and, in the process, push the envelope far enough to get called out on the carpet for it. Do we negotiate the Constitution, or do we embrace it, no matter how uncomfortable it makes us feel, no matter how hateful or ugly it gets, and no matter how much we may dislike its flag-bearers? Comedian Lenny Bruce laid the groundwork for the George Carlins that would follow in his wake: foul-mouthed, insightful, irreverent, incredibly funny, and one of the First Amendment’s greatest champions who dared to “ speak the unspeakable ” about race, religion, sexuality and politics. As Village Voice writer Nat Hentoff attests, Bruce was “not only a paladin of free speech but also a still-penetrating, woundingly hilarious speaker of truth to the powerful and the complacent .” Bruce died in 1966, but not before being convicted of alleged obscenity for challenging his audience’s covert prejudices by brandishing unmentionable words that, if uttered today, would not only get you ostracized but could get you arrested and charged with a hate crime. Hentoff, who testified in Bruce’s defense at his trial, recounts that Lenny used to say, “What I wanted people to dig is the lie. Certain words were suppressed to keep the lie going. But if you do them, you should be able to say the words.” What we’re dealing with today is a government that wants to suppress dangerous words—words about its warring empire, words about its land grabs, words about its militarized police, words about its killing, its poisoning and its corruption—in order to keep its lies going. As I document in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People , what we are witnessing is a nation undergoing a nervous breakdown over this growing tension between our increasingly untenable reality and the lies being perpetrated by a government that has grown too power-hungry, egotistical, militaristic and disconnected from its revolutionary birthright. Otherwise, there will be no more First Amendment. There will be no more Bill of Rights. And there will be no more freedom in America as we have known it. As the insightful and brash comedian George Carlin observed: “Rights aren’t rights if someone can take them away. They’re privileges. That’s all we’ve ever had in this country, is a bill of temporary privileges. And if you read the news even badly, you know that every year the list gets shorter and shorter. Sooner or later, the people in this country are gonna realize the government does not give a fuck about them! The government doesn’t care about you, or your children, or your rights, or your welfare or your safety. It simply does not give a fuck about you! It’s interested in its own power. That’s the only thing. Keeping it and expanding it wherever possible.” Tue, 02/09/2016 - 04:51 | 7159971 Father Thyme Control-freak Christfags like "peddling-fiction" just love to repress dangerous speech.

Mon, 02/08/2016 - 22:45 | 7159447 greenskeeper carl I agree, they'd approve. There was a big difference between pre revolutionary war founding fathers and post war. It only took them a couple years, and GW was putting down the whiskey rebellion (against new and higher taxes imposed by the federal government) with federal govt troops. Of course central bank enthusiast hamilton was along for the ride as well. Many of those farmers were soldiers in the war, and got a pretty tough lesson on what exactly it was they were fighting for. The alien and sedition acts were icing on the cake. It wasn't really the tyranny of king george many of them had a problem with, they just wanted to be in charge of it. The taxes most colonists had to pay to the new government were typically much higher than what was required by the british crown. Same with the rules and regulations. So, for all their talk of freedom and liberty, in truth the american colonies merely replaced the tyrant on the other side of the ocean with a whole gang of them here. Look how quickly it happened, too. They only made it a couple years before they were curtailing freedom of speech and press, banning certain things critical of the new government. People who don't read history in any depth get caught up in propaganda.  They may see some, where it serves their interest but they will gladly accept that which talks their book. Here's a free history lesson:  There never has been freedom for "We the people".   Mon, 02/08/2016 - 23:26 | 7159553 noless Especially the fat ones, and women, and minorities, they've gotta be on to something I'm missing, like not obeying the "law" or whatever.

We cannot survive 5 minutes without the "Nanny Corporations" providing everything to us we need in life to live -- we are totally reliant upon them since no one can provide anything for ourselves anymore -- we ALL go into stores for everything. The only skills we have left are to puh the red button at work and shop. The corporations rule over the "jobs" and "consumption," and we have no other option but to comply. The corporations (private sector) explicitly use "our" government as a Human Resources Department to control us with the laws they lobby for.  When people complain about the government, they're missing half the target: corporations' bosses control the government so they can manage us to labor and consume in the exact manner they want us to -- all to build their wealth. FUCK THE CORPORATE-GOVERNMENT COMPLEX!

Would they approve of restrictions on speech that was critical of the government. The answer is yes, they would support it, since the very same firebrands for freedom and liberty passed the sedition act shortly after America became a country. The supposed reason was to prevent people from making "false statements" about the government. Who got to decide if the statements you made or printed were 'false'? Why, the government of course. Passed by the federalists in order to suppress speech from their opposition. Those very same laws passed all the way back then, in what was a called a state of emergency, have remained in effect, and were even sighted by FDR when he rounded up the Japanese during WWII. So, even back then, the government was using the whole "state of emergency" line of bullshit it uses today. So, since the government today isn't really doing anything different than what the founding fathers did after they won control of the US, I'd say they'd approve of this just fine. When talking about the legend of America's founding fathers, its important to remember how their actions once they gained power were far different than their speeches they gave when trying to rally people to their side before the war. Tue, 02/09/2016 - 00:15 | 7159671 oldguyonBMXbike I always say, the Declaration of Independence made us all sovereign kings and the Constitution made us all slaves.  Good thing I wasn't around back then to sign it... Tue, 02/09/2016 - 04:02 | 7159948 zhandax GC, go back and read it again.  The 'State of Emergency' bullshit was first employed by Lincoln and has more or less been in effect since.

Mon, 02/08/2016 - 22:46 | 7159448 KesselRunin12Parsecs I wonder what FREE SPEECH advocate Leonard Alfred Schneider, (aka Lenny Bruce), would think about someone pointing out something that the past 3 FED CHAIRS, plus Stanley Fischer had in common. ''The statistical  probability of this incredible Jewish streak (Burns, Volcker, Greenspan, Bernanke, Yellen)   being 'coincidental' represents a virtual mathematical impossibility.   If Jews account for just 2% of the general population, then, all things   being equal, there would be a 1/50 chance of a single Jew being  selected  as Fed Chair. The odds of FIVE consecutive Jews would  therefore be 1/50  x 1/50 x 1/50 x 1/50 x 1/50  =  1 in 312,500,000!"'' Mon, 02/08/2016 - 23:10 | 7159509 Ms No Then you take that 2% and subtract the normal Jews that are not Rothchild Zionists and you have a way smaller percentage even which would probably make the odds astronomical.  Tue, 02/09/2016 - 00:13 | 7159663 oldguyonBMXbike Mon, 02/08/2016 - 22:47 | 7159452 OregonGrown http://www.opb.org/news/series/burns-oregon-standoff-bundy-militia-news-... Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy is coming to Oregon to demonstrate on behalf  of his sons Ammon and Ryan Bundy, as well as the remaining four armed  occupants of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. I've been following this thing pretty closely and another thing that bothers me is, this video here shows guys armed and dressed like rambo "supporting the sheriff" in fornt of the office with no id on their half-ass uniforms. The guy doing the filming asks who they are and they just hand him a card not saying who they are. Then...the filmer guy never tells anybody what's on the card? But...everybody is trying to figure out who they are. It's very strange, and it's hard to tell what to believe. Mon, 02/08/2016 - 22:51 | 7159462 Ms No I'm not positive but I think that Franklin would be hanging out with Jeff Epstein and Billy Clinton.  Jefferson would probably be being tortured in Guantanamo for demanding a duel with Soros or something. Mon, 02/08/2016 - 22:54 | 7159469 Sam.Spade No nice words or even street protests will turn this around.  We won't get our freedom back unless we take it.  In this case, that means using crypto to hide all our actions whenever we speak, buy, sell, or travel. Of course, it we manage to be effective at it, the government will make it illegal.  So we will all have to choose:  Obey the law and become data serfs or go underground and join the growing ranks of ID criminals. A Federal prosecutor and one of the 1% are talking: "With enough data, my lawyers can always find a crime. They'll prosecute. Bury anyone under legal motions, make his life miserable. Maybe even send him up for some felony." "Of course he did something. We got 100,000 laws on the books, twice that in regs. Somewhere, sometime, by accident or intentionally, he broke one. We get a moving x-ray of his life, all we have to do is find it." It's a great book, rated 4.6 on Amazon.  Almost a blueprint on how to fight back in the Internet age. Everyone needs to read it. What the Founding father's had that is sorely lacking is the willingness to die for a cause. This is in very short supply right now. Me before my kids. Mon, 02/08/2016 - 22:59 | 7159478 22winmag Iâ€™m going to cross post this because it works. I have been threatened with arrest, legal suits for defamation, cops shaking me down, warning me off, physically threatened, false accused of DUI, et cetera, and I stick-handled around them all. Because it was just bluffing on their part. And they knew, I knew, they knew it. You do this, and you put a target on your back the likes of which youâ€™ll never believe. But youâ€™ll win. And people will love you. It will empower others, to step up. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Iâ€™ve got a lot of experience fighting government, especially local. Hereâ€™s how to get attention: Name names publicly. How? Get a 4x8 sheet of plywood, and learn how to tile together a poster using InDesign or Quark or similar. Put your thoughts up, the old fashioned way. Trust me: Youâ€™ll be astounded at the path worn up to your fence. I pounded the crap out a environmental organisation who ran the board with our local community and the councillors of the town. Use graphics and such to mock, satirise, laugh at them, but mostly, just write about their conduct. Use the Rules for Radicals against them. You want to threaten to call the cops on me and my 85 year old Mudâ€™da? Go ahead! Thereâ€™s another poster. http://www.thechickenloop.com/t/oliphant-beach-accesses-are-blocked/577/8 Try to take my beach, assholes. Then what happens is the politically group youâ€™re after, the curtain drops and their real character starts to show and it ainâ€™t pretty. All that nice-nice, goes out the window real quick. Can you imagine having the cops calling you, on behalf of a eco-group, asking, then telling you take down your posters on your fence, or risk being sued for defamation?! Donâ€™t print anything that is a lie. You are allowed your opinion, and fair comment. You will find the more you do this, the crazier your opponents get, as they donâ€™t know how to fight you. Write about everything they do, because in the day of all this access, I can guarantee you, social media is too transitory. And nobodyâ€™ll read your webpage when itâ€™s just one guy. Put a clap board sign up on your driveway and youâ€™ll have people, hundreds, reading. Screw the plywood to your fence. And when you write letters to bitch, name names. Donâ€™t just bitch, send the letters to the authorities to have the dirtbags investigated. Tue, 02/09/2016 - 00:11 | 7159656 oldguyonBMXbike I'm doing this right now.  I don't own property, so I can't really put up a sign, but I go on the local newspaper site and call these criminals out as much as possible.  I plan to run for mayor next year on an anti-corruption platform.  I doubt I'll win, but I want to call them all out and make a mockery of the whole thing.  They can not hide any longer. Mon, 02/08/2016 - 23:04 | 7159496 Ms No The founders knew it would be banks everybody else blames it on Muslims or ghetto blacks.  This red team blue team meme has also worked quite well.  People think that capitalists are polar opposites of communists but it turns out that one funds the other.  I think Antony Sutton described it best as... ".. the usual conceptual straitjacket approach of Capitalist vs. Communist" Intellects such as Jefferson could not be bound by such silly means, I'm not sure about the motivations of the rest of them. Tue, 02/09/2016 - 00:44 | 7159587 Fuku Ben Why are licensed foreign agents discussing liberty, freedoms or the Constitution when they know, or certainly should know, that they are part of the structure that eliminated and enforces the previously fraudulently stolen system and whose job it is to be gatekeepers to prevent its return? Why do so many constantly reference violent action as a means to obtain freedom when it is not necessary and typically a strategy of agent provocateurs? Why is another licensed foreign agent head of the largest group of oath keepers? Wasn't Santilli the same alleged reporter that was a supporter of Police Chief Mark Kessler who frequently spoke about violence and turned out to be an FBI informant? I will drive, Oh, what a feeling (because I'm on the list now for sure)! The US Government Corporation is the world's premier foremost drug runner. Weapon pusher.
