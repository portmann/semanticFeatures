From Reflation To Redistribution: The "War On Inequality" Looms | Zero Hedge by globalintelhub - Jul 31, 2016 12:39 PM by Secular Investor - Jul 31, 2016 10:13 AM by Capitalist Exploits - Jul 31, 2016 7:31 AM The bigger picture narrative, according to BofAML's Michael Hartnett, is that the policy baton is passing from Monetary to Fiscal stimulus in 2016/17. Simply put, central bank rate cuts are ending; and new policies to address the populist desire for a "War on Inequality" are emerging. This 'fiscal flip' - as Hartnett describes it - means rotation from 'deflation' to 'inflation' assets... from 'financial' to 'real' assets. Broadly, this new policy response is likely to be a combination of: Keynesianism...reflationary (with “helicopter money): winners - TIPS, commodities, banks, value; losers - bond substitutes; yield curve bear steepens. The table below shows specific winners and losers contingent on each policy theme... Happily, the fiscal flip this summer has thus far been more biased toward redistribution & Keynesianism rather than protectionism. For example: In Japan Abe has hinted at an economic package at the upper end of the ¥20-30tn range with ¥13tn in fiscal measures, possibly to include 3% min. wage hike and ¥15,000 cash to low income earners; In Europe the growth of government spending has accelerated back to its pre-Global Financial Crisis pace, adding >1% to GDP growth in 2016 (note a newly permissive ECB cancelled Spanish & Portuguese fiscal rule-breach fines in the past month); And in the US both presidential candidates are touting infrastructure spending packages (Clinton proposes $275 billion in infrastructure spending over five years; Trump has also proposed tax cuts, infrastructure & health spending. Note Ethan Harris argues that in coming years fiscal policy is likely to become more effective than monetary policy. We are convinced that the flip from monetary to fiscal policy will drive asset allocation & asset prices in coming quarters. Fiscal flip reflects policy intent to reduce deflation, wealth inequality, wage insecurity. Success means rotation from “deflation” to “inflation” assets. max2205 Infield_Fly Jul 31, 2016 5:32 PM What with our current status in Amerika as guinea pigs in the experiment of Marxist political thought with Keynesian economics I'm buying four more pallets of .308 Anopheles Seasmoke Jul 31, 2016 5:07 PM Gold won't retain it's "value" in a worldwide economic collapse of a reserve currency.  The only thing that will be of value is the ability to produce something, or goods that are needed for day to day needs, and modest luxuries.   Historically, the entire world hasn't collapsed, just an isolated country here or there.   So demand for gold outside of those countries has maintained the value.   But who's going to buy your gold if EVEYONE is in the same boat?  Think about it.  If EVEYONE around the world is SELLING gold, who's buying?  Do you think buyers will offer a premium?  How about everyone only trusting payments in gold? They will not buy and sell gold, only use it as money. A reasonable point.  However for someone to use it in the first place, they have to buy it first, or convince someone else to part with theirs as payment for your goods or services.   If someone has a stash, how long will it last if they are using it to buy things?  Since it's a commodity, and a useless one at that, the price will be very volatile, and based on it's utility rather than perceived value.   Right now, gold has a high "value" because it's purchased with disposable income.   And that holds  true for both bullion and jewellery.   Investors?  They are holding gold, only becasue of zero interest rates, the opportunity cost to hold gold is low, and they see the potential of an upside.   However if the value goes down, or interest rates go up?  Investors will dump gold in a second for "something better".   Fancy name for socialism.  The very rich will leave, and the burden of "redistribution" will fall on the middle and lower upper class who chose to stay.    What does that do?  It takes money away from the wealth creators and the productive segment of society.   It gives that money to the deadbeats.   Overall economic prosperity?  NEGATIVE. That means trade sanctions, which increases costs of goods tremendously.   Takes disposable income away, and lowers the standard of living for everyone.   As for making shit in the country?  Who exactly will be able to AFFORD that overpriced stuff?   Exporting that overpriced stuff?  To where/whom?  If you piss off other countries by not allowing their exports in, they WILL retaliate.  Poof, there goes export markets. It's a short term patch that does NOTHING long term.  Except create massive debt that has to be serviced.  Short term, temporary boost, with long term PAIN The politicians are morons, but they are just giving the people what they want. They have to, otherwise they can't get elected. The real problem is people, becasue can't (don't want to) see beyond the present, and they want INSTANT gratification.   That's why all the economic SCHEMES fail, and in time, the entire system collapses.    Every economic scheme promises the instant gratification the moronic population is clamouring for.   What's really needed?   A tough "red" pill to swallow.  Meaning LESS government involvement, fewer rules and "protections" and less government spending but with lower taxes.   However every government in the world  is going in the opposite direction.  And that "blue" pill ignores the harsh reality, and the system goes on to collapse.  a Smudge by any... Anopheles Jul 31, 2016 5:12 PM hmmm...what about the redistribution of worker wealth (via taxes) to military contractors, government contractors and government itself? Upward redistribution dwarfs social spending. Anopheles a Smudge by any other name Jul 31, 2016 5:26 PM If you look at the budget numbers, social spending, including medical, social programs, welfare, social security, etc, is many times that of the military budget.   Military budget is on the order of $600 billion, and social spending on the order of $2 trillion per year out of a total budget of $3.8 trillion.  ersatz007 Anopheles Jul 31, 2016 5:28 PM "The very rich will leave, and the burden of "redistribution" will fall on the middle and lower upper class who chose to stay." The very rich have already left...by moving the means of production overseas.  They have the money to go anywhere they want. The lower upper class and middle class don't have much of a choice - they're stuck.   Red pill / blue pill - both are just slightly different ways to carry out cronyism. Neither is better than the other CorporateCongress Jul 31, 2016 5:20 PM Collectables and RE at all time lows? They must be smoking some bad shit. But commodities of the rare kind..
