How Japanese Consumers Are Affecting The Yen | Seeking Alpha Meanwhile, consumer spending has yet to benefit from weak price pressures. The Japanese yen remains hampered by weak consumer spending, weighing on economic activity, even as inflation steadily declines. CurrencyShares Japanese Yen Trust (NYSEARCA: FXY ) is down over 15% since July, seen below. Inflation measures in Japan continue to fall. In February, the inflation figure came in at an annual pace of 2.2%, down from the previous month's reading of 2.4%, while also missing estimates for 2.3%. Since peaking earlier this year, price pressures have trended broadly lower, concerning policymakers. Moreover, excluding the effects of last April's tax hike, inflation was flat last month due to weakening oil prices. "Excluding the effect of last April's sales tax hike, core consumer price index was flat in February compared with a year earlier, the first time since May 2013 that it has stopped rising. The cost of transportation and communication decreased by 0.4%," according to Trading Economics. Although prices pressures are subsiding, it has not translated into increased consumer spending. In February, the household spending figure came in at an annual pace of -2.9%, up from the previous month's reading of -5.1%, while also exceeding estimates for -3.2%. Over the last year, household spending has fallen from over 5%, to current levels, seen below. While policymakers hoped falling energy costs would translate into more spending, the reality is that small companies may not follow larger one in raising base pay , ultimately hurting consumer incomes. "Policymakers expect the slowdown in inflation, including the falling cost of gasoline, and rising wages to boost household spending in coming months and support a fragile recovery. But the weakness in consumption may drag on growth more than expected if small companies do not follow the footsteps of big manufacturers in raising base pay, analysts say," according to Reuters. A bright spot in Japan, however, is the strength in employment growth. In January, the employment figure came in at an annual pace of 0.64%, up from the previous month's reading of 0.62%. Since bottoming in 2010, employment has risen from -0.37% annual contraction, to current levels, seen below. Stronger employment hasn't necessarily translated to increased wages, though, adding to weakness in the spending measure. The Japanese economy remains under pressure as falling inflation and slow consumer spending weigh on policy decisions. Meanwhile, the labor market has strengthened, but this has not translated into upward pressure on wages. The yen will likely continue to fall against many of its peers as policymakers lean towards easing measures to spur growth.
