InvenSense - Beautiful Company, Ugly Chart - InvenSense (NYSE:INVN) | Seeking Alpha InvenSense has six-folded its revenue since IPO, but the share price is actually below IPO level. This isn't through mismanagement, it's basically an effect of market circumstances. Now that other markets are becoming more important for InvenSense, these headwinds could start to lessen, but shareholders have to exert considerable patience. Let's see the following graph of InvenSense (NYSE: INVN ) the market leader of so called MEMS (micro electrical mechanical systems) such as sensors, accelerometers, gyroscopes, compasses, and microphones. It isn't something to be overly happy with, if you happen to be a shareholder. This is odd, isn't it? Basically revenue has sort of six-folded but the stock price is below the IPO level (October 2012). Basically what happened is that InvenSense had to run ever faster (revenue wise) to keep at the same place (profit wise). At a certain time, this seemed to work, especially in the long gestation period leading up to signing Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) as a customer. This period was rumor filled and the share price managed to go well above $20 at one stage. However, Apple has been a rather mixed blessing, and we're putting it mildly. First, they drove such a hard bargain that margins compressed, and this has produced most of the fuel for the first leg downwards in the share price from above $20 to below $10. Now Apple itself has a revenue problem, and sales of the iPhone (and other products) are actually falling. And this has had an immediate impact on InvenSense (from the company PR ): Net revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 was $79.5 million, down 34 percent from $120.0 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2016, and down 20 percent from $99.3 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. GAAP net loss for the fiscal year 2016 was $21.2 million, or $0.23 per share, compared with net loss of $1.1 million, or $0.01 per share for the fiscal year 2015. On a non-GAAP basis, net income for the fiscal year 2016 was $45.6 million, or $0.49 per diluted share. This compares with non-GAAP net income of $42.7 million, or $0.46 per diluted share for the fiscal year 2015. And the bleeding isn't going to stop just yet. The company issued guidance for Q1 revenues of $58M-$62M (below consensus for $84.8M) and non-GAAP EPS of -$0.05 to -$0.07, vs. an expected $0.04 profit per share. We watch this with considerable dismay. InvenSense really is a niche market leader, this could be a German family firm from the famous Mittlestand, the backbone of the German economy. It's a beautiful high-tech company. They keep developing technically advanced products that should command premium pricing, even if they do have competition in the form the likes of Bosch and STM Micro (NYSE: STM ). Despite an enormous ramp up in sales, the stock price has gone nowhere (or actually worse, at the moment). What is actually the problem? It's not that the company has been terribly wasteful with resources, or badly managed. At least there are no indications of this that we could discern. The problem, in our view, has simply been that they ran into some of the strongest monopsony power out there. Apple, and to a somewhat lesser extent Samsung, have sucked almost all profits from the mobile phone industry and most of their suppliers. We remember the excitement when it was finally confirmed that Apple was a customer, but like we said, this has been a distinctly mixed blessing. From the Q4CC : There were two customers who individually accounted for more than 10% of our sales in Q4, and those customers represented 39% and 14% of Q4 revenue. There were two 10%-plus customers in Q3, and individually, they contributed 47% and 13% of our Q3 revenue. Apple is the big one, Samsung the smaller one. Is there hope? Actually yes, but it's going to take time. From the same Q4CC: Our Q4 versus Q3 revenue breakdown by market segment was as follows: Smartphones and tablets were 54% of total revenue in Q4, down from 65% in Q3. Optical image stabilization was 14% in Q4, even with Q3. And all other segments, including IoT, were 32% in Q4, up from 21% in Q3. Metrics will improve when these other segments, which are growing nicely (more than doubling in fiscal 2016), become dominant, as these are sold into more fragmented markets with less buyer power, so they could have more pricing power. But this isn't going to happen today or tomorrow, so shareholders have to exert patience. These sectors are emerging, and will be significant in the near future. This is stuff like drones, virtual and augmented reality, wearables, automotive and a variety of smart home, enterprise, and industrial applications. There still is a Mittlestand company lurking in InvenSense, as they introduced some 20 hardware and software solutions for these markets. If they can repeat last year's growth, the waiting doesn't even have to be too long. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
