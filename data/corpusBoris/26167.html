Pier 1 Imports Is Back With A Vengeance - Pier 1 Imports Inc. (NYSE:PIR) | Seeking Alpha After a previous stumble with a bad forecast, PIR beat estimates and guidance for fiscal Q4. The current fiscal guidance looks disappointing but the commentary suggests sandbagging. It's very rare that I'm able to time an entry into a stock very well but in the case of Pier One Imports (NYSE: PIR ) I nailed it. In my previous article entitled Hold Your Nose And Consider Pier One Import I made a case to buy PIR at the open at $11.41 and got lucky as that marked the low. Now with the stock over $14 I still think it could be a buy. PIR got hammered over 30% when it cut its guidance expectations a bit for the fiscal year ending Feb. 2015. One of my theories behind the cut was more to do with a simply a bad forecast from now ex-CFO Charles Turner who seemingly abruptly "retired" at the same time as the announcement. This was further evidenced when CEO Alex Smith said at the time, The failure to adequately forecast the revenue and expenses in our business is a financial issue which has been aggressively addressed. From a brand and competitive perspective, our business is sound. Fiscal Q4 results beat analyst estimates a bit and Smith again reiterated any weakness in 2015 was mostly due to what the company "budgeted" rather than weakness in the underlying business. Again, this seems to hint as putting the blaming on the former CFO. Smith pointed out that in just two years the company built an over $200 million e-commerce business. This segment of the business has me particularly excited as I detailed in my previous article Could Pier 1 Imports Become More E-Commerce Than Plain Retail? PIR did guide a bit below expectations for adjusted earnings per share in the seasonally inferior first quarter but a lot of that had to do with investments made with "people, systems, and physical infrastructure" that are expected to return higher profitability in the future. During the conference call , Smith stated, "Coming into fiscal 2016, we are entering a new phase. We need to ratchet up our profitability…...We believe these actions will pave the way for strong profit growth well into the future." What I find interesting about that statement is analysts currently have adjusted EPS at only $0.85 for this fiscal year or almost flat compared to $0.84 for the past year. Analysts either aren't buying a "ratchet up" in profitability and/or missed this forecast from the conference call. Smith added later in the call, "As we look forward, we are focused on accelerating growth and improving profitability." Again, analysts don't seem to have estimates that agree with that. Granted, PIR management guided for full fiscal year guidance of $0.83 and $0.87, but I suspect since these numbers don't jive that well with management's bullish comments that the company is sandbagging to be ultra-conservative especially in light of the past stumbles from the ex-CFO and the new CFO attempting to establish a more accurate track record. I believe this could be setting up PIR for an earnings beat or three as the year progresses. I plan to look for opportunities to buy on weakness ahead of reports.
