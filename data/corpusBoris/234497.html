For the last few years at Key Technology, we’ve been driving foundational changes we laid in to reshaping our culture, our approach to technology leadership, our global customer relationships and our overall ways of doing business. We’ve been implementing strategies from transforming Key Technology for tomorrow, advancing together with our customers and shareholders, and driving persistent execution routed in strategy. Our over-arching objective has been to position Key Technology for sustainable long-term growth and profitability, and to create long term shareholder value. A primary component of our overall strategic plan has been the development and introduction of new innovative platforms and solutions. On September 28, Key Technology introduced Veryx, our new innovative sorting platform at PACK EXPO in Las Vegas. By executing on this long term strategy to bring revolutionary innovation to our customers, and to renew Key’s Technology leadership, we have redefined digital sorting with the development of Veryx and established a new standard of performance. Our passion for understanding the needs of our customers and our vision to develop sorting solutions with functionality never before available in the industry, underscores our deep commitment to partnering with our customers to help optimize their operations and to build their overall returns. The innovative capabilities introduced to the sorting industry through Veryx includes, sustained, all sided product inspection, multi-sensor pixel fusion, and the highest resolution camera and laser sensors available on a digital sorter. With these capabilities in addition to many other features, Veryx achieves new levels of detection and discrimination of foreign material and product defects. The Veryx suite of solutions also offers a new innovative mechanical architecture, a simplified and intuitive user interface, and recipe driven operations enabling an extreme ease of use experience and performance consistency for customers. Every Veryx is configured around the product characteristics, application requirements, and process objectives for each customer, with configuration options ranging from very similar color cameras to the most complex configurations consisting of multiple camera and laser scanner combinations. Sensors are configured to provide sustained all-sided product inspection, eliminating blind spots and maximizing defect and foreign material removal. Veryx’s advanced multi-sensor pixel fusion capability integrates the input from multiple cameras and lasers to maximize differentiation between good and bad objects. Smart features including auto learning, self-adjustment algorithms, predictive system diagnostics, and smart alarms will all help minimize the need for operator interaction. New information analytics and data acquisition tools will allow customers to gather a broad range of product and operational data to adjust production for maximized return. Additionally, Veryx’s modular design enables customers to easily upgrade their sorter with additional or different features and capabilities as their requirements evolve overtime. Veryx will be ideal for sorting fresh, frozen and dried fruits and vegetables, process potato products, nuts as well as other products. Initially these capabilities will be available to customers in specific applications within our core markets, and with shipments anticipated to begin in the spring of 2016. The Veryx platform will complement our already impressive portfolio of sorting products, which will continue to offer very effective solutions in many situations. The introduction of Veryx is the result of a two year, global development effort by the entire company. It is not simply an end product, rather it is a sorting platform that we will leverage and continue to build upon in to the future. Veryx was deliberately designed as a modular, configurable and flexible platform that will be the intelligent core of an entire suite of digital sorting solutions, able to support a broad range of applications and processing needs. In the future months and years, we will be expanding the number of available Veryx applications and we will continue to invest in the development of new enhancements and capabilities for the Veryx platform expanding our customer value and our market reach. With the Veryx platform, we’ve been focused on leveraging technologies to create superior value for our customers, while also ensuring that our new solutions have been optimally designed for manufacturability, serviceability, modularity, configurability, reliability and costs. With the new modular Veryx solutions, we are incorporating new methods and processes in how we design, manufacture and service our products that we believe will help improve overall operating efficiencies in margins. And again our new modular platform designed also allows us to provide our customers with more flexible and configurable solutions. In addition to developing newly innovative and industry-leading platforms and solutions, a second strategic initiative for Key has been to grow market share in our core markets in EMEIA, North America and other high potential regions through existing and new applications and insertion points. Growing our business in the EMEIA region has been a major focus for Key over the past two years, and we have achieved record annual orders in euros for the second year in a row with euro orders increasing 32% in this region. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and the first quarter already of fiscal 2016, we have received orders in the high seven figures for a significant project from a major potato processor in the EMEIA region. These orders include engineering and layout services, material handling equipment and a significant number of optical sorters. This represents the largest project in the coming company’s history from the EMEIA region. We expect to start shipping these orders in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Our comprehensive analysis and understanding of the diverse market needs of the EMEIA region, the introduction of our new innovation solutions and our strong focus on strategic customer relationships, are positioning Key well for continued penetration of high potential opportunities in this region in the future. While we achieved record order results in EMEIA in fiscal 2015, business in North America has remained very sluggish for the second year in a row due to several factors including abnormally high capital investments in prior years, a shift in current capital investment to other geographies and other areas of the manufacturing process, the drought in California and the negative impact of foreign exchange rate on the export to products from North America. Despite the slower than normal business level in our core markets in North America, we’ve continued to build and enrich our customer relationships in this region. We strongly believe that these relationships in combination with our new solutions and platforms will position Key well for future opportunities, as they begin to arise in North America. We do expect to start to see an increase in orders in North America in fiscal year 2016, compared to fiscal ’15, and in the first quarter of fiscal year ’16, we did also receive a significant order from a major North American potato processor. Key is focused on improving long term operating results through the development of industry leading solutions, strategic partnerships, innovative process changes and efficiency improvements. Key’s current reliance however on near-term order volumes from large strategic customers in the process potato, vegetable and nut markets still makes our business vulnerable to short term fluctuations in revenue. Even with the downward cycle trend in North American markets during the past two year, we have continued to invest significantly in research and development. We continue to believe that bringing our new solutions to the market is the right strategy and will propel revenue growth and drive customer and shareholder value in the future. The impact of these strategic decisions on the company’s operating results however has resulted in a shortfall from our overall financial objectives for fiscal 2015. While management has remained confident in and focused on our long term growth strategy, we have simultaneously remained committed to maintaining a healthy, financial position and strong stable balance sheet. The management of our overall cost structure has resulted in a significant decline in operating expenses in all functional areas in fiscal 2015, compared to the prior year, establishing a scalable infrastructure for future growth. We anticipate that our new platforms and solutions will be enable us to drive a more stable revenue growth stream in two ways; by strengthening our position in existing market insertion points that will increase our core market share penetration in all geographic regions and by penetrating new market insertion points with customers in our core and high potential adjacent market applications. By addressing these insertion points with new industry leading platforms, continuing our investment in disruptive solutions and scaling our overall cost structure, we believe we are positioning Key well for stronger operating margins and profitable growth in the future and increase returns for our customers and our shareholders. We are confident in our long term strategic plan and appreciate your continuing support of our vision for Key Technology to be the ultimate partner of choice for our customers, partners and shareholders. Thank you Jack. First I will discuss the fourth quarter results for fiscal 2015. Fourth quarter net sales were $30.4 million compared with $32.6 million reported in the same quarter a year ago. Sales of automated inspection systems in the fourth quarter totaled $10.1 million, compared with $15.2 million in the same period a year ago, a 33% decrease. Fourth quarter net sales of processed system were $12.5 million compared with $9.4 million in 2014, a 33% increase. The decrease in automated inspection systems is primarily related to decline in the processed fruit and vegetable and nuts and dry fruit markets, with the most significant impact coming from North America. The increase in process systems was due primarily to the shipment of a few very large orders during the fourth quarter. Parts and service net sales were $7.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to $8 million in 2014. Gross profit for the fourth quarter was $8.4 million compared with $9.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2014. As a percent of sales, margins of 27.6% decreased from the 29.8% reported for the same quarter a year ago. Gross margins for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 were down compared with same period in the prior year, due primarily to unfavorable changes in the product mix, as the percentage of higher margin automated inspection systems has decreased significantly as compared to the prior year. Operating expenses of $10.2 million for the fourth quarter were 33.7 % of net sales compared with $9.9 million or 30.4% of net sales for the same quarter last year. Operating expenses for the three months period ended September 30, 2015 were impacted compared with the same period in the prior year primarily by higher sales and marketing expenses associated with the launch of Veryx and a significant trade show and higher R&D expenses due to the field tests of Veryx during the fourth quarter. The net loss for the fourth quarter was $1.5 million or $0.24 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $88,000 or $0.01 per diluted share in the same period last year. I will now discuss our fourth quarter 2015 orders and backlog. During the fourth quarter ended September 30, we recorded of $30.6 million. Last year’s fourth quarter new orders totaled $24 million. Our backlog at the end of the fourth quarter was $30.7 million this year, which compares with $18.1 million at the end of the fourth quarter last year. The backlog mix at the end of the fourth quarter was 51% automated inspection systems, 42% process systems, and 7% parts and service. Sale in fiscal 2015 were a $102.9 million compared to a $118.3 million in the prior year. Net sales of automated inspection systems were $37.5 million for fiscal 2015, as compared to $55.8 million for fiscal 21014, which represents an $18.3 million decrease or 33%. This decrease was primarily due to lower shipments in the process fruit and vegetable market, the other foods market, and the nuts and dry fruit market. From a geographic perspective, the decrease was primarily in North America. Fiscal 2015 sales of process systems were $37.8 million compared with $34.6 million, a 9% increase. This increase was primarily due to a few large orders during fiscal 2015. Parts and service net sales in fiscal 2015 were $27.6 million as compared to $27.8 million in fiscal 2014. Orders for fiscal 2015 were $114.8 million, as compared to a $110.5 million in the prior year. The increases were primarily due to an increase in orders in the process potato market offset by decreases in the process fruit and vegetable and nuts and dry fruit markets. Gross profit decreased to $28.8 million for fiscal 2015, compared to $34.3 million in fiscal 2014. Gross margins were 28% in fiscal 2015 compared to 29% in fiscal 2014. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to less favorable product mix. Operating expenses of $36.2 million for fiscal 2015 compared with $42.3 million for fiscal 2014. The decrease was primarily due to the cost savings initiatives implemented in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 and the second quarter of fiscal 2015, and decreases in R&D spending offset by the increased cost associated with the introduction of Veryx in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. The net loss in fiscal 2015 was $5 million or $0.80 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $5.4 million or $0.86 per diluted share in fiscal 2014. Our balance sheet remained strong with working capital of approximately $35 million; cash at the end of the year was $7.7 million, compared with $9.7 million at September 30, 2014. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, the company entered in to a new financing arrangement. This new arrangement allows for revolving credit facility of $15 million and a term loan of $5.3 million. This new facility allows for greater flexibility and stability moving forward and is expected to meet our needs in to the foreseeable future. During fiscal 2016, we expect to return the company to profitability. Net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 are expected to increase moderately as compared to the net sales reported in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. Gross margins are expected to be moderately higher in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2015. Operating expenses for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 are anticipated to increase slightly as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2015. I just want to start off first with OpEx. It appears that you had to add some heavier spend associated with Veryx, is there any way to talk a little bit about, number one, how should we think about R&D going forward? Is that going to drop down back to the levels that we saw in the first three quarters of the year? Yes, I would say that that’s a more realistic way to be looking at it Jim. We did anticipate some increases in this last quarter on the R&D and in the marketing side, but it was higher than expected and again it related to the testing and validation associated with the beta field testing of Veryx and then again the introduction of Veryx. But we would expect R&D to go back down to the levels where they were in the previous quarters. With respect to gross margin, if we look at it sequentially, you were down quite a bit and your revenues were only down modestly. You indicated that it was - the decline in margins was primarily mix related, but I wonder if you could talk a little about that. Sure. The biggest issue really is associated with again the mix and timing, and so although revenues were pretty consistent with where we expect it to be, each quarter you’re always going to have certain push-ups and pull-ins with regards to customer demand when they can install the products and those types of things. And the mix that we really ended up with this past quarter was the significantly low mix. So for example our optical sorting mix of revenues was only 33% in the fourth quarter compared to 43% in the fourth quarter of the prior year. And then within our optical inspection for example, our margins were also down compared to the prior year within AIS because of the mix of products within the AIS portfolio. So some optical products have higher margins than others, and the mix that we ended up with again was very low from an AIS perspective and then the product mix with AIS was also very low. So those factors played a significant role in the margins being down in this past quarter. As Jeff did mention expect the margins to increase in the first quarter. And Jack clearly Veryx is a crucial product for you guys, and it sounds like you have high expectations, I think just based on the way you’re describing it. Is there any sense, can you give us some feel for the market reception thus far and how do we think about the sales cycle for this product? So first of all with regards to the reception of the product, it has been extremely favorable. As you are aware, we’ve been doing field testing in all of our core markets in both North America and in Europe and the customer response to the capabilities and the functionality and the value that it brings has been very positive. As I stated a little earlier, we do expect shipments to begin in spring. We will roll out and release Veryx in a very controlled manner by application within our core market. We are not just automatically taking orders for any given type of applications where we get distracted, but we are really staying focused on those applications where we can provide real value and generate the types of returns. So we are staying very focused on that rollout, but we would anticipate that when we start shipments in this spring, that there will be applications in each of our core market that we will be shipping in. Can you say give us a sense what the order books thus far has been fairly, its early I understand, but can you talk about bookings for the products thus far. We’ve not take orders on the Veryx at this point in time, although we’ve built what we would consider to be a very strong funnel of Veryx opportunities on a global basis in all of our core markets. So we’d expect to get some orders now in the first quarter. We did not anticipate significant amount of order right at this time, with orders then expected to increase more in the second quarter and later part of 2016. I just want to drill down on this margin issue. So when you guys went out to redo your technology and spend on R&D and have manufacturable platforms going forward, the thought was that we’d see materially better gross margin. So when are we going to see those? All we are seeing is degradation and I realize that not all the new products are out in the field yet and/or in the backlog yet, but by Q2 of next year are we going to see substantially better gross margins that what you’re presenting. The thesis, you were going to create all this value-add for your customers and they will pay you for it. And I guess I’m still questioning, are they going to pay you for it. Yes Rick I think its two areas, one is the value they’re providing but also again how we’ve designed our products for manufacturability, durability and modularity and all those factors. I would say that we would start to expect to see some impact on our financial results on the latter half of fiscal ’16 with it being much more prevalent and insignificant as we go in to ’17. That’s what you said last year though. So we were supposed to see a materially better back half of fiscal ’15 and that didn’t materialize and so I guess you don’t have any orders yet on this new product that everybody is excited about. Why is that? Is that because of the seasonal aspect of it or --? Part of it is seasonality, part of it is sale. So for example, I talked about some significant orders that we have now received in the fourth quarter of ’15 and in the first quarter now of ’16 that are quite significant. Even though those are not specific to Veryx they certainly will have and incorporate certain features and capabilities that will be available on the Veryx platform. And I will argue that the Veryx had a significant role in us obtaining those orders been very significant orders for significant players here in Europe and in North America. And so although the last half of ’15 was not up to any of our expectations, we do believe that the Veryx will have a significant impact on our profitability and on the value for our customers and shareholders. Jack I missed some of the commentary around both the two; I believe you said two fairly large orders in EMEIA. Can you talk a little bit more about those orders in terms of the customer while you can’t name it? Was this an existing customer or is this business you took from a competitor? May be we could start there. Sure. It is a major project; I had mentioned it was in the high seven figures of which a portion of it was received in the fourth quarter and the remainder of the orders were received in the first quarter. It is the largest project that we’ve done in that region within our company. We’ve done certain work with that customer, but obviously the competition is at more of a significant role with that customer in the past. So it’s a very important strategic win for us with this major potato processor, and it does include engineering services, it does include PS, and it does include a significant number of optical sorters as I said that will entail and encompass some of the significant value that will be available on the Veryx platform as well. I also did note that there was a significant order that we received from another major potato processor here in North America that we received in the first quarter. And that also is a combination of optical sorters as well as material handling equipment. The first order in Europe was major expansion. The order here in North America is really enhancement to existing lines and bringing new capabilities into line in North America. Okay, and just on that subject of North America, you do have some unusual challenges here, just in light of the impact of the drought in California and just the overall weak capital spending environment. So, what are you assuming and what kind of a recovery might you expect in North America over the next couple of quarters from the bookings standpoint? Yeah, we’ve had some progress in the potato industry, 2014 was actually lower in North America than ’15. So we’ve had some rebound in potatoes in North America. And as I said now in ’16 we just got a major order. And on the vegetable side, it’s been very weak for two years and we’re anticipating both on the vegetable and hopefully on the fruit side to see some upswing in the latter part of fiscal ’16, and so we do expect to see an increase in orders in ’16 compared to ’15 here in North America. And with (inaudible) Jack, is it just the case that the business has been weak for an extended period and you’re just assuming the customers will have a new alternative but to step up their investments or are you actually seeing something that indicates that you’re going to see a recovery in that second half? Yeah I think in each case its unique with each customer, obviously we’ve been doing field testing of the new solutions with customers in each of our core markets. So if you take vegetables for example, you’ve got some customers that will have equipment that’s going to be coming off a lease here now or in the near term. So we are in communications with, okay, how do we structure this, how do we work effectively together. So one of the things I think we did an excellent job of is really working with our customers globally and what we have with our legacy and what we’re doing with the Veryx to make sure that we come up with the right solution with our customers. But in the vegetable side, there are several instances where products in the near term in the next 12 months to 18 months will be coming off of lease and they’ll be making more capital investments. Some of those customers had been making capital investments in other parts of the processing line. They all have capital budgets and so they’ve reallocated either because of acquisitions or other areas of the processing line that they needed to invest in. So they’ve curtailed their cutback on their spending, on the types of product that we provide. But in several cases we do anticipate that we’ll start to see an increase in spending in some of those areas. The drought in California certainly played a factor as well as the exchange rate which made it very difficult for our customers to export product, and as a result they also curtailed spending. So one of the nice things about Veryx is that we anticipate that we’ll be able to produce those products anywhere in the world with the design for manufacturability which will help us as well. And just with respect to the availability of Veryx and just in general how you see your pipeline of orders and the backlog. It sounds like the Euro is going to be weighted more towards the second half, is that fair to say? From a Veryx standpoint like I said, I would expect that will take a small amount of orders in the first quarter and that we’d start taking more orders in the second quarter and obviously much more of an impact in the latter part of the year for Veryx. But certainly overall as I’ve said we’ve gotten some large orders already in the first quarter, so we do expect a fairly strong first quarter from an order standpoint. And the positive side is, we’ve had our facilities utilization strong because of the backlog we had coming in to the start of the year, even though not all that will ship in the first quarter and a significant part will ship beyond the first quarter, our utilizations, our facilities as positives. So the backlog was strong coming in and we feel good about the funnel of opportunities both for Veryx and for just the normal business that we’ve been generating so far this quarter. Okay, and your comment about getting back to profitability in fiscal ’16. Is that comment meant to say that you expect to be profitable for the year or that you expect to get back, get to profitability at some point during the year? Just wanted to make sure I understood it correctly. With all the beta sites that were out there testing these new products, presumably you would likely they’d be first in line to place an order. So what’s the feedback you’ve gotten from the beta testers and how many are likely near-term to place orders. So I think the feedback from all of our beta sites has been positive, and it is our goal and belief that we’re in a good position with each of those. But again it’s going to be a matter of timing when it fits in to their capital spend and when it makes sense for their cycle for the season and that type of thing. And right now, we’re still continuing with beta testing on the potato industry to capture as much information as we can. The vegetable season is over in both North America and Europe, but we continue with our beta testing in potatoes in both regions to continue to make sure we provide ultimate value. But again the response from the customers has been positive, and we do believe we’ll be generating orders with these strategic customers. That is all the questionnaires that we have in the queue at this time. So I would like to turn the call back over to Jack Ehren for closing remarks. Just like to thank everybody again for your support. As a company, we are very excited about the release of Veryx and very proud of everybody in our entire organization to get Veryx to the point that we have. It’s taken an incredible amount of effort and an incredible amount of sacrifice from all of our employees, and I’m very proud of the organization and the direction that we’re trying to go and again I want to thank each and every one of you for your continuing support of Key Technology and we look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you again for your participation in todays’ conference. This now concludes the program and you may all disconnect your telephone line at this time.
