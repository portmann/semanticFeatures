While King vs. Burwell may present a headline risk, the role of HSA's in the U.S. healthcare system is unlikely to be affected. EBITDA margins continue to climb as the company continues to scale the business. Our investing process has, above all else, been (and continues to be) about identifying companies leveraged to secular trends, with a robust and attractive financial profile to match. Add in a compelling valuation, and for us that leads to a recipe for a winning investment. While this process can, will, and has led to missteps (our investments in and recommendations of Sonus Networks and Volaris come to mind), we believe that in the aggregate, such a process will lead to outperformance over relevant benchmark indices in the long run. And HealthEquity (NASDAQ: HQY ) is just such an investment. Since our October 2014 recommendation to invest in HealthEquity, shares of the health savings account provider have returned over 46% in ~6 months (as of the close of trading on March 26, 2015), well above the S&P 500's return of ~7% over the same time period [as measured by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA: SPY )]. HealthEquity posted strong Q4 2015 (the three months ended January 2015) earnings on March 24, and the company's results confirm that our initial thesis continues to play out. HealthEquity remains a prime beneficiary of healthcare reform in the United States, and its scalable business model is leading to continued expansion of its margins as the company continues to accumulate more and more members. We are raising our price target on HealthEqutiy from an initial $23.55 to a new level of $28.17, implying upside of ~11% from current levels. The company's fiscal 2015 fourth quarter results, released on March 24, 2015, saw growth across all relevant business and financial metrics, and in our view, serve to confirm our thesis that HealthEquity continues to benefit from the changes that are occurring in the U.S. healthcare system (for more on health savings accounts and HealthEquity's position within the U.S. healthcare system, refer to our previous coverage). Unless otherwise noted, financial statistics and managerial commentary used in this article will come from HealthEquity's Q4 2015 earnings call , as well as its Q4 2015 earnings release (and prior earnings releases as well). In Q4 2015, HealthEquity posted yet another quarter of record performance, bringing fiscal 2015 to a strong close as the company continues to execute and scale its business (which forms a key part of our bullish thesis for the company). We break down the company's financial results in the table below. For Q4 2015, HealthEquity posted total revenues of $24.871 million, beating consensus by $1.37 million, and EPS of 4 cents, beating consensus by a penny. Revenue growth at HealthEquity continues to be driven by growth in HSA members (more details on this and other business metrics to follow later), which bring with them growth in custodial fee revenue (tied to the assets under management at HealthEquity), and card fee revenue tied to plan members' usage of their HSA cards. Total revenue in Q4 grew by almost 45% year-over-year (and almost 42% in fiscal 2015), with growth driven by both account and card fee revenues, with similar dynamics playing out in the company's gross profit metrics. In total, gross profits grew by over 52% in Q4, driven by a 80% increase in account fee gross profits. As we discussed in our initial write-up of HealthEquity, scalability is a key feature of the company's business model, and that fact has helped support gross margins in both Q4 and fiscal 2015 as a whole, where gross profit grew by over 47%, helping boost gross margins by more than two full percentage points to 55.06%, with gross margin increases seen in all revenue segments. On the expense side, HealthEquity continues to leverage its overall expenses, led by sales & marketing. HealthEquity's sales force is a key asset for the company; as of the end of fiscal 2015 the average sales representative at the company has an average tenure of six years, helping them stand out to both current and prospective customers. From the company's results in Q4 2015, it is clear that HealthEquity's sales force is becoming more productive; sales and marketing expenses fell to 13.8% of sales in the quarter, down by almost a fourth year-over-year (and almost 17% in fiscal 2015), thereby more than offsetting increases in other expense areas. For the time being, we do not see these as cause for concern. Given the fact that HealthEquity went public in the summer of 2014, it is unsurprising to see general & administrative costs increase as a percent of sales in both Q4 and fiscal 2015, due to the fact that the company now incurs a variety of permanent expenses that come with being public. The rate of growth in general & administrative costs is likely to decelerate over the next several years as year-over-year comparisons begin to fully take into account HealthEquity's status as a publicly traded company. We also note that technology & development expenses continue to rise sharply as well. For the time being, we do not see this as a cause for concern. In fiscal 2015, technology & development expenses rose by just 16 basis points as a percent of sales, and while they rose by 58 basis points in Q4 2015, this appears to be related to the timing of certain expenses, as opposed to an underlying acceleration in spending. Overall however, HealthEquity's expenses fell to 34.82% of sales in Q4, down more than two full percentage points year-over-year, helping EBIT more than double and expanding EBIT margins by 500 basis points. Similar growth played out in EBITDA as well, which rose over 101% year-over-year during the quarter, boosting EBITDA margins to 22.13% in the quarter. We remind investors that HealthEquity's EBITDA margins are structurally lower in the second half of its fiscal year; the bulk of the company's membership growth is back-end loaded into its fiscal year (which ends in January). As a result, while growth may be elevated in the 2nd half, so too are expenses as the company ramps up spending to service the large influx of new clients. This leads to profits being front-end loaded in the company's fiscal year, as we noted in our initial write-up; EBITDA margins stood at 33.24% for the first half of fiscal 2015, versus 28.73% for the fiscal year as a whole. From an operational standpoint, HealthEquity continues to grow on all relevant metrics, namely HSA membership and assets under management, which are the two key drivers of revenue and profit growth. We break down HealthEquity's operational metrics in the table below. HealthEquity ended fiscal 2015 with over 1.4 million HSA members, an increase of over 47% year-over-year, and almost 29% on a sequential basis (Q4 2015 is HealthEquity's strongest quarter from an enrollment perspective due to insurance plan enrollment patterns). This growth is a testament to the benefits of the HealthEquity platform, both to consumers and employers and insurance plans (as a frame of reference, HealthEquity's retention rate stood at 98% in fiscal 2015). During the year, HealthEquity's growth in HSA members was matched by growth in its partnership base. Health plan partners expanded from 57 to 70 plans (an increase of almost 23%), while employer network partners rose by almost 93% to 270. The company's membership base remains diversified; no health network accounts for more than 4% of total members, and no network accounted for more than 7% of new HSA member additions during fiscal 2015. Importantly, HealthEquity continues to increase its penetration at existing partners; in fiscal 2014 and 2015, 80% of HealthEquity's membership growth came from existing partners. We also believe that HealthEquity is continuing to gain market share within the HSA industry. According to Devenir Research, which specializes in tracking data related to the HSA industry, aggregate HSA accounts in the U.S. grew by 29% in 2014 to reach 13.8 million. Based on HealthEquity's ~1.43 million membership base, this gives the company a market share of 10.34%, up from 9.05% a year ago (based on Devenir's 2013 figures), further entrenching the company as one of the largest HSA providers in the U.S. Overall, the industry continues to grow at a solid pace, as both employers and health plans continue to turn to HSA's in an effort to cut costs and optimize health care spending. Just as important as the growth in HealthEquity's membership base is the growth that the company is seeing in assets under management, which drive custodial revenue growth (and at 80%+ gross margins). Total AUM rose to almost $2.4 billion in Q4 2015, up over 45% year-over-year, and almost 29% sequentially. AUM growth, for the most part, tends to track membership growth fairly closely, given that all HSA members have at least some level of assets within their plan. More important is the growth in investment assets under management, which carry structurally richer fees than HealthEquity's cash assets. Investment AUM grew by almost 47% year-over-year to over $286 million, or 12.13% of HealthEquity's total, up from 11.24% a year ago. Investors would be remiss not to note the sequential decline in the percentage of AUM tied to investments, which fell from 13.99% on a sequential basis. This, however, is not a sign of a fundamental weakening of the HealthEquity investment model (more detail on this is provided in our initial write-up). Rather, it is a reflection of the seasonal nature of the company's business. With HSA members growing by almost 29% sequentially, Q4 is the company's strongest in terms of new membership. However, when new members are brought onto the HealthEquity platform, their assets start out as cash, and it takes time for them to be shifted over to investments. As management noted on the company's Q4 earnings call, 55% of member accounts were less than two years old at the end of the quarter. As a result, account balances for those accounts remain low relative to the company as a whole; historically, the average HSA balance in the first year has been $800, but triples on average over the next five years (as a reminder, HealthEquity was founded in 2002, and as a result has 13 years of HSA data to work with). We fully expect that in Q1 2016, HealthEquity's investment AUM will continue to post year-over-year growth, both in absolute dollars and the percentage of total AUM tied to investments. We turn now to HealthEquity's guidance for fiscal 2016. Currently, HealthEquity issues guidance only for the full fiscal year; no guidance is issued for the current quarter. However, with HealthEquity having reported only three sets of quarterly results, it is possible that this may change in the future. For fiscal 2016 (the 12 months ended January 31, 2016), HealthEquity is guiding for total revenues of $117-$121 million, EBITDA of $35.5-$37.5 million, and EPS of $0.28-$0.30. Investors should note the relatively tight ranges for these metrics, particularly in light of the fact that we are currently only in Q1 of 2016. As we highlighted in our initial write-up of HealthEquity back in October, the company benefits from a robust level of visibility into its business; at the start of any given fiscal year, the company has ~90% visibility into the revenues for that year. Given the recurring nature of HealthEquity's revenues, this leads to guidance within a fairly tight range. In the table below, we present HealthEquity's guidance (at the midpoint of its range) in relation to the company's results for fiscal 2016. For fiscal 2016, the midpoint of HealthEquity's guidance range calls for revenue growth of over 35%, and EBITDA growth of 44.6%, implying further expansion in full-year EBITDA margins to over 30% (we remind investors that EBITDA margins in H1 2016 will be at least several percentage points higher than the full-year forecast implies, due to the seasonality of the company's business). EPS growth is slated to come in at 38.10%. It should be noted, however, that this is only an initial forecast, we are assuming that fiscal 2016 plays out in the same way as fiscal 2015 did, we believe that guidance will be raised later this year. In the table below we provide a review of HealthEquity's actual fiscal 2015 results and its guidance for the year as provided alongside its Q3 2015 and Q2 2015 (its first quarter as a publicly traded company) results. As the table above shows, HealthEquity's actual fiscal 2015 results came in either at or above the high range of its guidance across all three of its explicitly forecast metrics, and comfortably above the midpoint of its implied EBITDA margin forecasts. As a result of HealthEquity's solid Q4 2015 results and guidance, we are raising our price target on shares of HealthEquity to a new level of $28.17, representing upside of ~11% from current levels. Our new price target is based on a target fiscal 2018 EV/EBITDA multiple of 30x (based on Bloomberg consensus estimates), discounted back 10% to the present. Our assumptions and figures are laid our in the table below. As our initial write-up made clear, our bullish thesis on HealthEquity is predicated on the company's place within the HSA industry in the context of the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. However, as many investors may point out, King vs. Burwell, which is now pending before the Supreme Court (the case was argued on March 4) may threaten to derail the Affordable Care Act. Therefore, it is only natural for investors to ponder the implications of this on HealthEquity. In our view, the outcome of this case is unlikely to be material in the long run for the company, even if a ruling against the IRS' ability to issue subsidies to customers that purchase health insurance through exchanges established by the federal government is issued (the Supreme Court is expected to issue its ruling on the case in late June or early July). If the Supreme Court rules in favor of the government, the status quo is maintained, and the current exchange & subsidy structure is maintained. However, if the Supreme court rules in favor of King, then that would create meaningful uncertainty about the future of the ACA, and the broader U.S. healthcare system, as the IRS' ability to issue subsidies is a core component of the Affordable Care Act. Given the uncertainty that a ruling in favor of King would create, we expect that Congress would need to get involved to resolve the issue, at least to some extent. We wish to stress, however, that this should not be seen as an endorsement of a ruling in favor or Burwell; we are not commenting on the merits of King vs. Burwell, but merely stating that a ruling in favor of King would likely lead to uncertainty about the ACA's future, not that such uncertainty is a negative. That being said, HSA's themselves are unlikely to be altered as a result of any new action by Congress. While the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act, the legislation that created HSA's, was passed on mostly partisan lines (220-215 in the House of Representatives, 54-44 in the Senate) in 2003, that was due to debate over the much larger issue of Medicare Part D. We note that in the 1990's, legislation concerning medical savings accounts, the precursors to todays HSA's, garnered bipartisan support in Congress; in 1992, 12 different bills received more than 150 cosponsors in Congress. From a more practical perspective, we believe that regardless of potential future changes to healthcare reform in the U.S., HSA's will retain their place. As we discussed in our initial write-up, HealthEquity's growth (and more broadly, the growth in HSA's) is tied not the ACA as a piece of legislation, but on the legislation's ability to drive the growth of high-deductible insurance plans, which in turn fuels growth in HSA's. Any healthcare reform effort centered on lowering the uninsured rate is highly likely to emphasize high-deductible plans, given the practicalities of financing health insurance reform within the context of the United State's political environment. We continue to see HealthEquity as a prime beneficiary from ongoing reform of the U.S. healthcare system. The company is continuing to take market share in the HSA industry, and all key operational metrics continue to grow. The company's guidance calls for further expansion of margins this year, and we believe that guidance may prove to be conservative as 2015 plays out. While ongoing litigation over the Affordable Care Act may cause near-term uncertainty, we do not believe that this will be a long-term issue, and would be buyers on a dip caused by such uncertainty. High-deductible insurance plans are likely to play a key role in any reform proposal developed by Congress should the Supreme Court issue an adverse ruling (to the government) in King vs. Burwell, and we do not believe that the HSA industry itself is at risk. With a clean balance sheet, continued growth in both HSA members and assets under management, we believe that HealthEquity will continue to gain market share this year, and delivering value to both its partners and shareholders.
