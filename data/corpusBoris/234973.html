Consumer spending has been impervious to all efforts to get it back to historical levels. Where has the consumer gone? This is one of the most important - and vexing - questions being asked by the Federal Reserve, Congress, and other anointed guardians of America's financial welfare. Charts, tables, and disquisitions from experts are useful, but a full understanding requires looking at the numbers in context with the real people they represent. Individual circumstances reveal important insights about future consumer prospects. Consumer spending is 70% of the American economy and has been the most important driver of growth for over 30 years. It is both a sign and a cause of economic health. See this excellent article from the St. Louis Federal Reserve for a full discussion. But while other areas of the economy have grown since the Great Recession, consumers have stubbornly lagged what has been expected and needed. As the St. Louis Fed reported in 2012: "Inflation-adjusted per-capita consumption expenditures grew at a 2.4-percent annualized rate during the decade ending in December 2007, but have grown at only a 1.4-percent annualized rate in the 28 months since the recession ended ..." Readers are cautioned against extrapolating recent headlines about income and spending into changes in multi-year trends. John M. Mason , Eric Parnell , and Lawrence Fuller are a few of the Seeking Alpha heavyweights who have published recent articles about the poor consumer performance. The importance of consumer spending to policy makers is clear by the number of programs aimed at raising it. Low interest rates, TARP, QE, the 2009 stimulus, and the "wealth effect" are some of the attempts, and their failure has mystified their creators. The various macroeconomic factors related to this issue - labor participation rate, Baby Boomer retirements, consumer indebtedness and so on - are familiar to Seeking Alpha readers so will not be repeated here. They have a role in the consumer problem, but leave the explanation incomplete. When you put aside the numbers and look around, more nuanced aspects of the problem are revealed. The personal side - our situation and that of the people we know - shows specific stressors, why we are reluctant spenders, and the probability of change. The stories below are from personal observation and will be familiar to many readers. Names have been changed. Full time to part time: Pam is a dental hygienist in an office where two hygienists each work two 10 hour days a week. Why? Her employer doesn't have to pay benefits, and if business changes layoffs are easier. The result: Pam has little job security, and she has to fund her own retirement, medical, and other benefits. As a consumer she has much less money to spend. Less financial security makes her even less likely to spend what she does have. College loans: Robert, like Pam, has a part-time job so his employer does not have to pay benefits. On top of this, he has a large student loan. After taking care of rent, transportation, and the loan payment he barely has enough for food, much less discretionary spending. His loan will be paid off in 16 years. Underemployment: Mary is very bright, young, and has a master's degree. After being in the job market for eight months, she has a job in her field that requires a two year degree and provides a net paycheck of about $1,800 a month. She considers herself fortunate because there were 80 applicants for the job, including six Ph.D.'s, 40 other master's degrees, and numerous people with a decade of experience. Independent contractors: Susan was reclassified by her small company from employee to "independent contractor." She only realized the implications at tax time when she had to cough up a year's worth of social security contributions, both the employee and employer parts. The independent contractor phenomenon is a huge boost for employers, who eliminate the cost of SS or Medicare contributions, worker's comp, benefits, and lots of paperwork. It's a big drag on the unfortunate employee who has to shoulder more expenses. Regulatory drag: Jack is a manager at a regional money management firm. His company recently hired 250 compliance officers to handle Dodd-Frank and other new regulations. A key component to increased consumer spending is higher income, which is dependent on increased productivity. These well-paid new employees are a drag on productivity and add nothing to the firm's business prospects. SA readers will know other stories about split shifts, parents dropping out of the workforce because of high child care, the Social Security Disability "epidemic," and more. They have a depressive effect on consumers' ability or inclination to spend, and illustrate secular trends such as: The probability that these trends will reverse is not high. They come from durable institutional and societal structures that change slowly. The following list is not complete, but vividly illustrative: Disability epidemic: The proportion of the population on SS disability has been increasing for over 20 years, doubling in the last 17. It decreased in 2015, but largely because of the huge backlog of applications , which has gone from 694 thousand to a million in five years. 2. Labor's share of GDP has been going down for 30 years . One of the major reasons proposed is the increasing imbalance between corporate vs. labor interests . There are changes in this area, notably local higher minimum wage laws and expanded Federal prevailing wage rules, but the imbalance is still very large. 3. Consumers are still burdened by historically high debt levels. Student loan debt has become a major burden. President Obama has taken steps to attenuate this as recently as last month, but the totals continues to grow. 4. Involuntary part-time employment is a structural change here to stay barring a massive increase in labor scarcity. The cost savings are very attractive to employers. Five years after the recession, the number is still 50% higher than longer-term statistics. 5. Is there anyone who thinks that regulation will reverse its multi-decade growth? Here is a 40-year chart of the number of pages in the Code of Federal Regulations: An oft-discussed solution to the consumer predicament is policy change. Relaxation of student debt, support for higher education to reduce student costs, reversing the multi-decade trend of more regulation, stronger support for blue and white collar labor (reversing another multi-decade trend), and tougher requirements for entitlement programs are a few of the areas addressable through policy. Americans have started to pay more attention to the perceived causes of their plight. There is growing concern about things like income equality, unsustainable debt trends, education cost, and an unlevel the playing field. However, it's a long road from recent first discussions to the broad changes they hint at. In the absence of policy changes, we must look to approaches that are not consumer-based. Economic growth from exports, infrastructure development, research, or any number of other drivers can lead to higher incomes and spending. In those situations, however, consumer spending is a sign of a better economy rather than the cause of it. Consumer spending was the driver of growth for 25 years before the Great Recession. It was expected to be the driver of the recovery as well, and much effort was aimed in that direction. After seven years and trillions of dollars of failure, let's hope the Federal Reserve and other policy makers recognize the weaknesses of the consumer paradigm. Behind statistics showing weak consumer spending are millions of people in difficult, intractable economic circumstances that stem from long-term societal and economic trends. Without addressing these factors, more attempts to directly boost consumer spending will fail just as the earlier ones did. They require political, social, and economic changes which, while hinted at in recent years, are far from the necessary national consensus and political will. The ability of the consumer to drive the American economy has been declining for years and our best hope is to focus on other engines of growth. The ability of the American economy to come back strong should never be underestimated. We will have a resurgence of growth but it will be not be based on the consumer paradigm of the past. Until then, we have collective and individual obligation to help the millions of Americans under severe financial stress find the way out.
