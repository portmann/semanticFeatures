How New Evidence May Impact DC District Ruling On Fannie And Freddie - Fannie Mae (OTCMKTS:FNMA) | Seeking Alpha Two prior Fortune 50 companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac give all their money to the United States government, now totaling over $108B in less than 8 years. A lawsuit dismissed late in 2014 is up for appeals in the DC District court in 2016 that could potentially turn over the earlier memorandum opinion. If Fannie and Freddie are allowed to retain capital, equity shares currently trading as penny stocks may no longer be penny stocks. The government won't just show the truth and instead tax collectors are spending time and tax dollars asserting various privileges to save taxpayers from themselves. Attention to detail is critical when reading legal documents and I am not a lawyer but I have put thousands of hours and dollars into this now. Fannie Mae ( OTCQB:FNMA ) and Freddie Mac ( OTCQB:FMCC ) are often referred to as Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) since they were brought into existence by the government and then sold to private investors decades ago. With no exception, since the time they have been brought into operational existence they have served as the gold standard and set the bar for the thirty year American home mortgage. I can't help myself. I've borrowed over $250,000 across the last 15 months and bought myself 87355 shares of FNMAS and 5271 shares of FMCKJ. Now, I'm going to tell you why I am doing this. Before I dive into my reasoning on a point by point basis regarding why I agree with Judge Steele's assessment that "Perry Capital court's reasoning is utterly bankrupt," let's first discuss why you may be interested in learning more as an investor with money to allocate. Right now, the equity securities of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on a valuation basis appear to trade like call options of their intrinsic value in a scenario where the two underlying operating entities are allowed to keep some of the money that they make. This is in contrast to their current arrangement whereby they make billions of dollars per year and that money is transferred quarterly to the US Government in an agreement between the government and itself designed to leave the GSEs penniless in 2018. In the process known as conservatorship, the two GSEs entered with their highest capital levels in history and have transferred $108B+ to the government while the government puts out news headlines suggesting that the GSEs are a broken business model. As an investor, $108B+ of cash across no more than 8 years is the opposite of a broken business model. The website that I primarily used to put this together was gselinks.com , by the way. There they have all of the legal filings . Each one of the legal filings is special in a different way. The New York Times tried to get access to the documents the government doesn't want anyone to see. Better Markets wrote a brief in support of the government. Now that discovery has shown up the plaintiffs want to amend their complaints to reflect any evidence that they think proves the government broke the law. There was a fight about if they could talk to the Chairman of the Board of Directors to ask Egbert Perry for his side of the story. A former FDIC Chairman weighed in. It's all taking a lot of time and the longer it takes the better it is for the government until the jigs up I guess if it comes to that, nobody pretends to know. The New York Time's has done a great job . The Economist has done a great job too. I don't always know what I'm doing but I submit to you the hypothesis that Treasury knew exactly what it was doing the entire way through and this hypothesis has been corroborated by one of the GSEs prior CFO's Timothy Howard who points to internal Treasury discussions about the potential costs and benefits of nationalization: Secondly, another prior GSE executive and prior CFO Susan McFarland has provided testimony that we can't see but we can feel its gravitational pull on plaintiff's arguments to compel production of certain documents: These two chief financial officers of Fannie Mae seem to be supporting the notion that the reason Fannie Mae is having financial problems is not because they aren't making any money as the government would have us believe but instead because the government is preventing them from keeping any of the money they make for themselves because the government wants to take all of their money as a matter of public policy. If Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are at any point in time allowed to retain their earnings, equity shares of the two delisted penny stocks could trade significantly higher. William Ackman and Richard X. Bove seem to suggest that $20 is a good starting point on the common shares if the government decides to exercise the warrants that it took as part of the original agreement. Ackman projects a combine normalized earnings of $15B available to common shareholders if the government is no longer allowed to keep taking their money. What's kind of funny about that is I think that the government projects that it will be taking more money from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac than they are being forecast to make by William Ackman. Mr. Ackman must think it's his money or something that they are taking. I wonder why. Maybe you can help me figure it out. Please help me solve this mystery. Now that you understand that the potential upside of owning securities is over 100%, let's review what's going on in the DC District's Court of Appeals. Lamberth: The Difference Between Can't and Won't Regardless, the MEMORANDUM OPINION issued by Lamberth proposes that HERA empowers FHFA to take everything without judicial review: To Operate Outside The Statute Is To Violate The Statute How exactly does the government unilaterally bankrupt two Fortune 50 companies by funneling their net worth to itself while acting as conservator when the powers as conservator are completely the opposite? David Fiderer, who has written a book breaking down publicly available information on the GSEs proposes that the government has rationalized away the plain meaning of HERA and basic concepts of corporate law and insolvency law by saying that they are exempt from judicial review and has been able to stonewall shareholders at every turn by asserting evidentiary privileges. That's really where things get interesting for shareholders because in aggregate the legal teams that represent us have subsequently obtained evidence "which shows the government's defense to be outright false" that has been presented to the D.C. Circuit Court. In other words, while the government has been stonewalling in court A, the lawyers representing shareholders in court B were able to get evidence they say undermines the government's defense in court A and then submit this evidence to court A where the government put forth this defense that is now under Appeals. Per the Perry Capital Institutional Appeal Brief , we quickly can discern that the nature of the Third Amendment Net Worth Sweep constitutes a new security by Treasury's own definition: This is important because Treasury lacked the authority to purchase new securities after 2009. If the modification of a preferred security from a 10% dividend to taking the net worth of a company is by Treasury's own definition an entirely separate security altogether, plaintiffs suggest that this conduct is ultra vires. This would suggest that in this instance Treasury is willing to overlook its own rules for classifying transactions for tax purposes if by doing so it increases payments to Treasury. What's interesting is that most tax law is built around ensuring that taxes are paid when owed. This is instead a situation where a tax collector may have decided that it was owed more than should have ever been paid and where tax law can be used to protect taxpayers from tax collector over reach. From Lamberth's MEMORANDUM OPINION we see FHFA's claims: First off, dividends are not owed. There's a huge difference between equity dividends and debt interest. Secondly, there was a PIK clause that provided that the dividends could be paid in kind, suggesting that this alleged downward spiral of having to pay anything may simply be a story manufactured for the convenience of nationalizing two Fortune 50 companies without having to worry about shareholders. Lamberth basically didn't have the evidence on hand when he ruled that the court has now: Now, with discovery being shared from Judge Sweeney's court, statements like that no longer can be made in so far as being made because they don't have evidence. Still in dispute, however, are 11,292 documents that the government has asserted various privileges over. My view on that is that Fairholme says that evidence has been submitted in the court proving the government's claims as false and from what I can see of the redacted legal filings from Fairholme, they've got a lot already. Even still, 11,292 documents is a lot of documents that the government doesn't want us to see. To put that in perspective if 100 people were emailing back and forth once a day for 90 days, you're still short of how many documents the government doesn't want us to see. To put it another way, it sure looks like the government isn't attempting to cover up any one particular thing as much as they seem to base their defense on covering up everything and the chief problem now is that depositions undermine their arguments and plaintiffs already are distributing discovery to courts far and wide. Ugoletti's Written Affidavit Helped Lamberth Dismiss Earlier Lawsuit Now Being Appealed As a reminder, Mario Ugoletti put out the statement used by Lamberth to help dismiss this case the first time: In a separate lawsuit, Saxton plaintiffs have brought into question Ugoletti's declaration above. Either discussions happened or they did not. Ugoletti's written statement above says they did not. He was deposed, however, and according to plaintiffs his testimony calls into question evidence submitted by FHFA in the district court. Then there's this as it relates to Ugoletti's testimony which seems to suggest that Ugoletti said something during his testimony that the government doesn't want us to see: Here's what we know. We know that the government has told us that the Third Amendment Net Worth sweep was put in place to save Fannie and Freddie from a death spiral. It can only stand to reason that the government doesn't want us to see what he said if it doesn't support the earlier published statement he gave for them and signed for them. Do government officials really not know the law? It can't be that easy can it? These are the questions investors are asking themselves because we may soon be looking for government jobs. The average government salary for federal civilian workers was $84,153 on average in 2014 according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). The money that they are taking from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can employ 178,246 people if you assume they are taking $15B away from Fannie and Freddie per year. That money is going somewhere ladies and gentlemen. We want our jobs! The government is taking our jobs! Give us our jobs back. Give back Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, who have had to pay $108B for the privilege of your oversight and accounting magic that I have yet to see anyone contesting. This is when the two CFOs of Fannie Mae seem to be supportive of the companies. It's tough. It's really too bad that this has all happened this way and it's really too bad that the courts have to stop the government but that's just how this is these days and it's not all that bad. Things have a way of sort of fixing themselves when things go wrong and this appears to be no exception to the rule that winners win and winners get a winners share and not losers take all. They don't like it when you tell them the truth but that's because they already know. I know I did. Then again, there's a mammoth case there where a prior Judge himself is filing to get clarification from people who may know better than federal judges about how to interpret state law governing parts of the companies under the express understanding that FHFA could not exercise powers that it itself did not have in the relevant states where state law governs : Most recently, class plaintiffs filed their initial reply brief in which they make what I think amount to a pretty compelling set of arguments that seems to make a great case that I don't know how the government is going to defend against: Rights just don't exhaust themselves and vanish at times only to reappear at others. To have rights in receivership and not throughout the process that gets you there is to have no rights as all. This is where FHFA's case collapses faster than a folding chair. FHFA has a very solid history of interpreting laws as loosely as possible in order to take away and exercise rights that were not theirs to begin with. And that's where you end up, the perpetual conservatorship. It now all makes sense. The reason things are taking so long is because they are designed to take so long as to exceed the escape velocity of various statutes of limitations. Genius. People just can't talk about it: While Parrott declined to answer questions, some of us are wondering why and the rest of us are able to piece it together. Mr. Parrott is just following orders. That's what we want, order in the court because it certainly hasn't been the prescription for the chain of events that has by design nationalized two of America's best companies. When Lamberth's ruling came out the stocks of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac got obliterated. Since the time of his ruling, discovery in Judge Sweeney's court of claims has produced evidence that has subsequently been filed in the DC District Court of appeals. This evidence at the very least does not seem to support the notion that the reason behind the Third Amendment Net Worth Sweep was to save Fannie and Freddie from a death spiral. My view is pretty simple and is basically that based on the new evidence submitted to the Appeals Court, plaintiffs will prevail and the equity shares could trade significantly higher. Oral arguments are on April 15 and the world is watching. If at the very least, it's worth staying tuned because the legal woes of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac make great shows . I will never truly understand why Peter J Wallison insists that Fannie and Freddie are to blame on as many news sites as he can. Combined they took $132.2B of cash and have paid back $241B of cash, netting Treasury $108.8B since conservatorship began. The money doesn't lie, Fannie and Freddie are Fortune 50 quality companies.
