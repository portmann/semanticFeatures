Russia plans to impose 10 percent cuts on government spending | Reuters MOSCOW Jan 12 The Russian government has approved a plan to require government departments to cut spending by 10 percent compared with previous plans, repeating a policy also imposed in 2015, two government sources told Reuters. Russia is under pressure to find spending cuts as the international oil price has plunged towards $30 per barrel, a major problem for the federal budget that relies on oil and gas taxes for almost half its revenues.
