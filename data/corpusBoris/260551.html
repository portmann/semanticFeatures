At this point, I'll turn the call over to Matt. Thank you, David. Welcome everyone. We appreciate you joining us this morning. I'll begin our prepared remarks with some comments on quarter four and the fiscal year. Paul will follow with the financial review and then we’ll open the call for questions. We ended fiscal 2015 on a strong note; sales were up 4.7% from quarter four of fiscal 2014 driven by a significant increase in on-road OEM applications. This increase was partially offset by the continued weakness in our industrial business and the currency fluctuations. Before I get into the Q4 results in more detail, I would like to take a moment to comment to the year and our strategy going forward. Fiscal 2015 was a record year for Sevcon and the year in which we made excellent progress. Our total sales increased 8.5% from fiscal 2014. Sales for on-road applications grew up 50%, while sales in our traditional off-road industrial market segment were flat. We rolled a record number of product shipments during the year and rolled out customizable technology solutions designed for on-road and off-road applications that is aimed to help achieve a 30% volume improvement over traditional technologies. We introduced a breakthrough GEN5 technology platform in September concluding the fiscal year with a key milestone. GEN5 is a breakthrough because it uses standardized core components that lead to cost effective development of a wide variety of products and solutions for on-road and off-road electrification. These core components are setting new standards of reliability, flexibility and security allowing customers to easily adopt and customize them to their specific applications. Customer response to GEN5 has been extremely encouraging, we currently have a number of projects in the pipeline that will be utilizing our GEN5 Size 9 and Size 7 on-road water controllers that’s aimed for high performance electric and hybrid electric vehicles. Inside products is aimed for off-road applications or on the roadmap for the near future. Our visions is to become the leading supplier of electrification technology to our target industrial and automotive markets. We are pursuing high volume electrification meters in on-road and off-road that promise strong growth and where our products can achieve leadership positions. However, penetrating these new markets will require significant investment in engineering sales and marketing and therefore we expect earnings to be somewhat volatile in the interim as we lay the foundation for the next cycle of robust growth. Now I would like to discuss our results for quarter four starting with geography. As a reminder, it's our policy not to discuss specific customer relationships until we are in commercial production and shipping in volume. Sales in United States remain strong up [30%] (Ph) year-over-year driven mostly by the on-road OEM's marine and architect sectors and despite continued weakness in mining and other traditional markets. Sales in Asia increased 7% from the prior year on continued growth and shipment volumes. Although sales in Europe declined approximately 8% year-over-year driven by a lower demand from the industrial sectors, we saw significant improvement over the United Kingdom mainly due to the engineering work we are doing with partners in Germany. Looking over quarter four results by end use sector, sales remained weak in our industrial off-road markets continue to reflect the underlying macroeconomic trends. Mining [Indiscernible] platform and fork lift trucks were down double digits from quarter four last year. We did see however a modest improvement in Chinese fork lift sales. [Indiscernible] marine business kept its positive momentum during the quarter and we expect that to continue. We finalized an engineering contract with Seakeeper the manufacturer of gyro stabilizers for leisure yachts and commercial marine applications to develop a smaller version of the controller that we are currently shipping to them for use in the larger vessels. The smaller controller includes some of our new GEN5 inverter technology. This was specifically designed for this application which is one of the new Sevcon’s electrification products currently being trialed and employed by OEM's and Tier-1 suppliers in both the agriculture and construction sectors in Europe, Asia and South America. Turning on to our marine business, our agriculture business also grew nicely during the quarter. We expect the agriculture and construction equipment to contribute more significantly to our top and bottom lines during the next few years. Turning now to the on-road business in quarter four, we saw a strong growth in both the four-wheel and two-wheel sectors with four-wheel up 144% and two-wheel up 67% year-over-year. This is second consecutive quarter that two-wheel set to show significant growth. Sales in the two-wheel markets were once again driven mainly by product shipments to electric motorcycle OEM's in Europe and United States. As a reminder, the two-wheel sector tends to be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. In the four-wheel sector, growth was driven by the continued recognition of engineering services revenue and overall progress we are making on the electrification projects with a large German manufacturer of trucks, buses, engines and transportation solutions. We are also making progress with our Chinese joint venture which is initially targeting four-wheel on-road electric and hybrid vehicle applications selling principally to Chinese Tier-1 automotive suppliers. We expect the JV to begin production and shipments sometime in calendar 2016, longer term, we believe the JV positions us to expand our opportunity set in what is becoming the world's largest market for two-wheel and four-wheel electric vehicles. In addition to the on-roads and off-road sectors, we continue to see accelerated growth in our other EV market where quarter four sales were up 23% from the prior year. Along with the progress we are making with Seakeeper, this growth was driven by product shipments to a wide range of customers and numerous applications including recreational vehicles, go-kart and utility vehicles. Fiscal 2015 as a whole, other EV sales were up 42% year-over-year comprising 20% of our sales which is another indication that electrification is appearing in a wide variety of applications and geographies. Looking forward to fiscal 2016, we believe Sevcon is well positioned for further design wins with an expanding number of GEN5 products and increasing base of blue chip customers. We expect our traditional off-road industrial markets will continue to be weak and are proxy of the global economic trends. We’re taking the necessary steps to accelerate our industrial sector growth and these initiatives are progressing well. In both the off-road and on-road sectors, we are continuing to focus on opportunities related to the global demand for electrification. In total, our targeted electrification issues represent an estimated $2.4 billion addressable market in 2020. We believe that our GEN5 technology will enable Sevcon and its customers to be faster to market, reduce risk and gain share in high growth electrification applications. As I mentioned earlier, we expect to remain in an investment phase to allow us to capitalize on the growing number of electrification projects in our pipeline. We anticipate that our earnings will be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter for the next couple of years as a result. That said, we will continue to execute against our long-term growth strategy where we’re mainly focused on the bottom line and on creating value for our shareholders. Thank you Matt and good morning everyone. Reviewing Sevcon’s financial performance for the quarter and starting with the income statement, total revenues increased 4.7% to $10.5 million from $10 million in the same period in fiscal 2014. As Matt mentioned, this growth reflects increasing customer demand for the products we have been developing for an expanding range of applications in the on-road sector and our other EV category, including higher product volume shipped to Seakeeper. Foreign currency fluctuations decreased reported sales by $554,000 or 5.5% for the quarter mainly due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared with the Euro and the British Pound than in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. Excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, revenues increased 10%. In terms of geography, our overall Q4 sales growth was largely driven by the United States and the Far East, where revenues increased by approximately 13% and 7% respectively from the same period last year. This was primarily due to growth in the two-wheel and four-wheel on-road OEM and other EV sectors including marine. Sales were down approximately 8% in Europe mostly reflecting a decline in sales to aerial work platform, forklift truck customers but partially offset by higher sales to on-road OEMs. These year-over-year increases more than offset a reduction in sales in our North American mining business. Mining continues to be challenging due to the global decline in this sector and in coal mining in particular. As Matt mentioned, we are making good progress with our Chinese JV, which continues to ship product prototypes designed specifically for the unique requirements of the Chinese market. Turning now to operating expenses, we are continuing to benefit from our low cost manufacturing model. We have traditionally relied on third-parties for the majority of our production. Outsourcing to trusted manufacturing partners allows us to add capacity, while minimizing the additional fixed costs. As a consequence, our operating expenses consists primarily of product development, engineering, sales related expenses and general and administrative expenses including compensation and direct R&D costs. Our operating expenses includes engineering and R&D costs, which are reported net of grants received. Engineering and R&D expenses net of grants was 12% of sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 compared with 9% in Q4 last year. This continuing level of expenditure reflects our ongoing commitment to product development and improvement. On a reported dollar basis, total operating expenses for Q4 decreased by $111,000 from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. However, in Q4 last year we recognized two non-recurring charges amounting $699,000, a $481,000 charge for the establishment of our Chinese joint venture, and a charge of $218,000 to recognize a write-off arising from a bankrupt customer in France. Excluding the impact of these two charges, operating expenses increased by $588,000 reflecting the additional cost in 2015 of the Chinese JV, as well as increased investment in sales and engineering including the hiring of additional staff. This investment and additional resources was in response to the higher order intake and to address substantial potential future opportunities. In addition, the increased operating expense year-over-year reflected lower grant income in Q4 of 2015 compared with the prior year period. The Company recorded grant income of $49,000 in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with a $105,000 in the fourth quarter of 2014. This grant income was recorded as a reduction of research and development expense in each period. Foreign currency fluctuations decreased reported operating expense by $217,000 or 6% due to the stronger U.S. dollar compared with the euro and the British pound than in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. Sevcon generated operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 of $677,000 compared with an operating loss of $94,000 in the same period last year. We reported an income tax charge of $218,000 this quarter or 38% of pretax income compared with a charge of $21,000 or 17.5% of pretax income in Q4 last year. The increase in the effective tax rate year-on-year was due to $112,000 write-down of a differed tax asset in Q4 2015 without which the Q4 2015 effective rates would have been 18.5% of pretax income. Other dividends paid and accrued of $105,000 the whole as the series A convertible referenced shares, Sevcon reported net income attributable to common stock holders of $254,000 or $0.8 per share for the fourth quarter of 2015. This compares with the 37,000 or $0.1 per share in Q4 of fiscal 2014. Let’s turn now to cash flow and working capital items. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, receivables, inventory and prepaid expenses and other current assets increased by a combined $2.2 million which decreased cash during the period. Accounts payable, accrued expenses and accrued taxes increased by a combined $1.4 million in the fourth quarter, which increased cash during the period. The Company invested $221,000 in tooling, test and R&D equipment during the quarter as we invest in capitalizing on the electrification opportunity Matt spoke about. The number of days’ receivables was six days lower at 60 days at September 30, 2015 than at the end of Q4 last year. Sevcon ended the fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $8 million including the rights issue funds. This compares with $11.2 million in cash at the September 30, 2014 year-end and $1.7 million of bank loans. The $3.2 million reduction in cash during the year included the repayment of $1.7 million of loans provided by Citizens Bank plus a new loan of $500,000 drawn down. $263,000 of preferred stock dividends were paid, $98,000 of common stock were purchased and retired and $1.3 million of capital expenditures were incurred and $145,000 related to the effect of exchange rates on cash. With regard to the repayment of the $1.7 million dollar loan with Citizens Bank, we have retained the $3.5 million secured revolving credit facility with that Bank. This credit facility will expire in June 2017 when any principal drawn down at that time will be payable in full. We also have a $1.4 million bank overdraft facility with Nat West Bank available to our UK subsidiary companies. This facility was renewed for a further period of 12-months in July 2015 and was unused at the end of the fourth fiscal quarter. Let's now look at Sevcon results for fiscal 2015 as a whole. Total revenues for the fiscal year were $41.1 million compared with $37.9 million in fiscal 2014. In our control segment, sales increased by $3.3 million or 9% and in our capacitor segments sales declined $102,000 or 5% year-on-year. Sales increased 1% in our traditional off-road industrial market and sales in the on-road market increased 41% year-over-year. Sales for on-road two-wheel applications were up 30% and sales for four-wheel applications were up 46% primarily reflecting growth in Europe and North America including both EV and hybrid applications. Gross profit for fiscal 2015 was 42% of sales compared with 39% in fiscal 2014. This increase reflects a higher margin sales mix of the control segment in 2015 as well as the impact of fixed overheads costs representing a lower percentage of the sales total. Sevcon reported operating income of $1.9 million for fiscal 2015 versus $1 million in the prior year. We recorded an income tax charge of $406,000 or 21% of pretax income in fiscal 2015 compared with $85,000 or 10% of pretax income last year. The higher effective tax charge in 2015 largely reflected the $112,000 right down of a differed tax asset in the fourth quarter of 2015 as well as the impact of differing tax rates in the different jurisdictions in which Sevcon does business. Reflecting the factors that I just outlined, Sevcon reported net income for fiscal 2015 of $1.1 million or $0.32 per diluted share, asset preference dividends of $440,000 or $0.13 per share. This compares with $909,000 or $0.28 per diluted share in fiscal 2014 after preference share dividends of $23,000. Wrapping up and echoing Matt, we are committed to continue in Sevcon's profitable growth and look forward to reporting our progress in the quarters ahead. With that, we’ll be happy to take your questions. Kevin you can proceed with the Q&A now please. Hello, hi guys. A couple of questions, one more housekeeping, just trying to figure out what tax rate will make sense going forward, I think you had mentioned 18.5% ex everything for Q4. I was just wondering what tax rate to use going forward? Yes, good morning Scott it’s Paul here. Thank you for your question. You are right, I brought together an adjusted rate of 18.5% compared to 17.5% last year. I think you can expect a rate in that range and maybe slightly above as I have mentioned also. It does depends on the profits in the various jurisdictions in which we do business and there is a wide range in tax rates that are applicable to the Sevcon business and it ranges everywhere from 40% approximately in the U.S. down to the mid teens in our UK business and after all release and benefits available to us. So somewhere in that mid range or something that would be - we would expect to see going forward. Great, thanks. And then, the second question is just related to - you talked about continued investment phase. Maybe you could layout because I think you main expenses, product development, G&A, sales and I’m not sure if R&D and engineering is with product development, but maybe if you could layout what buckets are primarily going to be where you spend and where you are doing it now and when do you get returns from that? Good question Scott, it’s Matt. For 18 months, two years now, we have been investing heavily in engineering and that’s where I see the bulk of our future investment coming. We’ve got a very good set of relationship around the world and our sales network is very well entrenched in the market segments and with the larger customers that we would like to do business with. So if we focus on anything, we will be focused on investment and engineering. Okay. and will OpEx, again I think you may have - well OpEx, will that be growing faster than revenue or with revenue or are there parts like G&A that you can lever but you will be spending in engineering, maybe characterize that just to touch for me? Okay, no at this point I’m not expecting it to grow at revenue type growth rates. Two reasons for that, one is in order to be spending that money we have to pay the engineers and that’s been a problem - 12 months notes now. As I have said in the press that’s an issue, but at the same time there are growth projects in the pipeline and we have to invest in order to get them. So [indiscernible] but I don’t think it’s going to grow kind of revenue and increasing rates. Okay. And then maybe one last question. You talked about engineer - how are you from a sales perspective, or is it more of your quarter book of more sales engineer that you need, maybe as appose to just pure sales guys. Is the sales engineers is that that the key guy you are looking for? No Scott, it’s definitely research and development engineers I’m looking for. I’m blessed because my sales forces are general engineers and there is an engineered to sale, but most of the focus is on getting R&D. Thank you. We've reached end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Boyle for any further or closing comments. Thank you, Kevin. Thanks everyone for listening this morning and I guess happy holidays is the expression used in America. We look forward to speaking to you in the next quarter and that concludes our call. Thank you. That does conclude today’s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.
