Best Russell 1000 Stocks According To Buffett Principles: United Natural Foods - United Natural Foods, Inc. (NASDAQ:UNFI) | Seeking Alpha Ranking the top twenty Russell 1000 stocks, according to principles of the well-known investor Warren Buffett. Explanation of the "All-Stars: Buffett" ranking system. A Ranking system sorts stocks from best to worst based on a set of weighted factors. Portfolio123 has a powerful ranking system which allows the user to create complex formulas according to many different criteria. They also have highly useful several groups of pre-built ranking systems; I used one of them the "All-Stars: Buffett" in this article. The ranking system is based on investing principles of the well-known investor Warren Buffett. The "All-Stars: Buffett" ranking system is quite complex, and it is taking into account many factors like; book value growth, operational P/E, price to book value, trailing P/E, price to tangible book value, price to cash flow and EPS stability, as shown in the Portfolio123's chart below. In order to find out how such a ranking formula would have performed during the last 17 years, I ran a back-test, which is available in the Portfolio123 screener. For the back-test, I took all the 6,389 stocks in the Portfolio123 database. The back-test results are shown in the chart below. For the back-test, I divided the 6,389 companies into twenty groups according to their ranking. The chart clearly shows that the average annual return has a very significant positive correlation to the "All-Stars: Buffett" rank. The highest-ranked group with the ranking score of 95-100, which is shown in the light blue column in the chart, has given the best return - an average annual return of about 12.3%, while the average annual return of the Russell 1000 index during the same period was about 3.4% (the red column at the left part of the chart). Also, the second and the third group (scored: 90-95 and 85-90) have yielded superior returns. This brings me to the conclusion that the ranking system is very useful. After running the "All-Stars: Buffett" ranking system for all Russell 1000 companies, on May 30, I discovered the twenty best stocks, which are shown in the table below. In this article, I will focus on the second-ranked stock, United Natural Foods (NASDAQ: UNFI ). United Natural Foods, the largest wholesale distributor of the natural, organic and specialty food industry in the U.S. and Canada, has recorded substantial growth in the last few years; organic and by acquisitions. The company's annual average sales growth over the last five years was very high at 16.9%, and the average earnings-per-share growth was high at 11.9%. The average annual estimated EPS growth for the next five years is also high at 10.3%. On March 07, United Natural Foods reported its second quarter fiscal 2016 financial results; earnings per share of $0.49 were in line with expectations. UNFI posted revenue of $2.05 billion in the period, matching Street forecasts. The company missed earnings per share estimates in two of its last four quarters, as shown in the table below. Net sales increased 1.5% to $2.05 billion compared to $2.02 billion for the same period last fiscal year. Adjusted net sales increased 6.5% compared to the same period last fiscal year, excluding the year-over-year impact of the previously disclosed termination of a customer distribution contract and, for the second quarter of fiscal 2015, the previously disclosed non-recurring reduction in net sales. Diluted EPS was $0.45 compared to $0.55 for the same period last fiscal year. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.49, excluding $2.0 million of severance and other transition costs related to a previously announced restructuring plan and approximately $1.0 million of acquisition related costs. Free cash flow generation of $106.2 million, the largest free cash flow quarter in Company history. In the report, Steven Spinner, President & CEO, said: We are intently focused on managing our business in a rapidly changing environment. We will make strategic investments to improve our sales growth rate and customer experience through the back half of this fiscal year and into fiscal 2017. We are working to build new distribution opportunities and expand our relationships with current customers. Our announcement today of the acquisition of certain assets of Global Organic further demonstrates our strategic focus on increasing UNFI's product offering into the perishable perimeter. We believe our infrastructure, supply chain and logistics network are uniquely positioned to add meaningful value to customers in an evolving food retail environment. UNFI reaffirmed its previous outlook. For fiscal 2016, the company estimated net sales in the range of approximately $8.31 billion to $8.43 billion, an increase of approximately 1.5% to 3.0% over fiscal 2015. Adjusted earnings per diluted share for fiscal 2016 is estimated to be in the range of $2.34 to $2.44, compared to fiscal 2015 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.85. Earnings Release Third Quarter Fiscal 2016 United Natural Foods is scheduled to report its third quarter fiscal 2016 financial results on Monday, June 06, after market close. According to 16 analysts' average estimate, UNFI is expected to post a profit of $0.66 a share, a 20.5% decline from its actual earnings for the same quarter a year ago. The highest estimate is for a profit of $0.68 a share while the lowest is for a profit of $0.63 a share, not a big difference. Revenue for the first quarter is expected to increase 1.9% year over year to $2.16 billion, according to 14 analysts' average estimate. There was one down revision during the last 30 days. Since the beginning of the year, UNFI's stock is down 8% while the S&P 500 Index has increased 2.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index has lost 1.5%. Moreover, since the beginning of 2012, UNFI's stock has lost 9.8%. In this period, the S&P 500 Index has increased 66.9%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index has risen 89.4%. UNFI's valuation is excellent, the trailing P/E is low at 13.91, and the forward P/E is also low at 14.04. The price to sales ratio is extremely low at 0.22, and the price to book value is at 1.26. Furthermore, the price to free cash flow is very low at 13.62, and the enterprise value/EBITDA ratio is also very low at 7.47. I see long-term solid growth prospects for the company, although lower margins are expected in the next few quarters due to weaker product mix. Natural Foods has been expanding its fresh foods business and investing in cold-storage facilities and distribution centers. The 2014 acquisition of Tony's Fine Foods, as well as the previous acquisition of Albert's Organics, has increased the company's distribution of fresh foods. In my view, the increasing demand for healthier fresh food will improve the company's profitability in the long run. However, higher freight costs and investments in storage facilities expenses might hurt UNFI's earnings in the short run. In my view, United Natural Foods will benefit in the long run from its strategy of expanding its fresh foods business. According to its valuation multiples UNFI's stock is pretty cheap; the price to free cash flow is very low at 13.62, and the enterprise value/EBITDA ratio is also very low at 7.47. While I do not expect a significant rise in UNFI's stock price shortly, I believe that the stock is a good long-term investment. It might take some time. However, a patient investor could see a considerable price appreciation sooner or later.
