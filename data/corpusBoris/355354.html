Debunking So-Called Disturbing Consumer Behavior | Seeking Alpha Recently reported consumer spending data for February showed mediocre growth, and January was revised downward as well. I have recently theorized that stock market volatility in early 2016 affected the economy via a sort of reverse feedback loop, and is the key reason behind recent poor readings. American consumer behavior is certainly impacted by our sense of net worth, which is tied to our home values and 401K and pension plan values. Fresh data reported this week for consumer confidence showed an improvement in March. Not coincidentally, the stock market recovered all of its early year losses by St. Patrick's Day. Other fresh data around housing has shown similar contrast and improvement, and so I anticipate current concerns about the economy are overdone. Perhaps you were disturbed by the so-called disturbing consumer spending data reported last week. I know I was. However, I believe I have uncovered what was behind it, and I see a change in that same catalyst happening now for the better. Fresh data is verifying my view. Thus, I'm looking for consumer spending to be reported much improved in the months ahead. The Personal Income & Outlays Report for February showed mediocre consumer spending growth at just 0.1%. The slow pace matched economists' expectations, but not after accounting for the deep downward revision to January's pace of growth to 0.1%, from 0.5%. The revision meant we have had two consecutive months of sorry spending growth. So is the economy in trouble then? Is Janet Yellen correct to be cautious? The answer is no, and fresh data is verifying that. Fresh Consumer Confidence data was reported by the Conference Board on Tuesday, and it contrasted greatly with the consumer spending shortfall in January and February. The data for March showed the Consumer Confidence Index gained to 96.2, from 94.0 for February (revised upward from 92.2). The Present Situation Index declined moderately to 113.5, from 115.0, reflecting slightly deteriorated views of the current environment but still relatively strong. The Expectations Index, however, increased to 84.7 in March, from 79.9 in February, as consumer expectations for the future have improved. So what has changed to improve the consumer perspective? The stock market obviously. The happiness of Americans is directly tied to their sense of net worth, so that when home values or investment portfolio values change for the better or worse, their spending habits are very likely influenced. Today, Americans are more aware of changes to the stock market than you might think. It's because of the tie of corporate America's pension plans and retirement planning through 401K plans to the market. As these passive investors receive their monthly portfolio statements, their mood and spending habits are influenced. Those statements and the headlines across media in January and February of this year were quite distressing. This tie led me to author my theory about a negative feedback loop between early year stock market volatility and economic data being reported now for February. Popular theory is that the U.S. economy may be slowing due to the impact of overseas issues on multinational manufacturers and also due to the fast and furious decline of energy prices, and their impact on certain regions of the nation like Houston. However, I believe the recent decline of domestic data has been greatly due to the volatility of securities markets and individual portfolios. I think we got evidence of that in this week's housing data, which either covered March or was forward looking to March. In my report, Fresh Data Dispels Housing Market Concerns , I show how the Pending Home Sales Index and the Weekly Mortgage Applications Survey conflict and contrast with the just reported shortfall in February's Existing Home Sales. Similarly, I hope I've shown here how the Consumer Confidence data for March also conflicts and contrasts against the Consumer Spending data reported for February. What's this mean for the future then? Well, it's probably not a good indication about this week's Employment Situation Report for starters. The jobs report covers the month of February, and so it very well may reflect the uptick we saw in weekly jobless claims in February and the weakness of energy prices and the stock market in February. I believe there is a good chance hiring slowed as well. However, the gains of the stock market since mid-February, taking equities to above where they started the year, has already started to correct business activity in my view and also based on data discussed herein. That means that the economy could be in better shape than recent downward revisions to Q1 GDP growth forecasts depict. That is the good news for investors. The bad news may be that it also means current caution by our Federal Reserve may soon return to the hawkish trajectory we started the year with.
