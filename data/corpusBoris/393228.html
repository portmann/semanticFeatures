Krugman's Solution Is "The Fiscal Equivalent Of War" - Japan Agrees | Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! Submitted by Lakshman Achuthan via BusinessCycle.com, In the wake of the Bank of Japan (BoJ) decision to stand pat, Japan looks to be in ever more desperate straits, given the growing danger of sliding into its second recession since Abenomics was introduced. Such a recession would be the nail in the coffin of Abenomics, launched with high hopes and much fanfare three years ago. It made sense, therefore, for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to seek the advice of Paul Krugman, who has been one of the chief cheerleaders for Abenomics, in a private meeting last month meant to lay the groundwork for the G7 Summit at Ise-Shima next month. Although it was evidently supposed to be confidential, we recently chanced upon a rather revealing transcript of that meeting, which also included BoJ Governor Kuroda and Finance Minister Taro Aso. Mr. Krugman began by declaring that “we are now in the world of pervasive economic weakness. In many ways, we are all Japan.” He concluded “that monetary policy needs help from fiscal and possibly other policies [which] is … very much a global issue at this point.” Recalling how World War II catapulted the U.S. economy out of the Great Depression, Mr. Aso then emphasized that they were looking for a similar trigger to make entrepreneurs abandon their “deflationary mindset” and “start making capital investments.” Mr. Krugman responded that they were “looking for ways to achieve something like that without war” – what he subsequently characterized as the “fiscal equivalent of war.” Then, regarding G7 countries with policy space for fiscal stimulus, he opined that, while Japan and Canada would go along, Germany, the U.S. and the U.K. were unlikely to “implement significant stimulus measures in coming months.” In Germany’s case, it was “very difficult to make the argument” as “they simply live in a different intellectual universe.” In the U.S., while President Obama favored major fiscal stimulus, it was not yet politically feasible, but at least, Mr. Krugman said, “we can blunt the push for fiscal consolidation.” Meanwhile, he said, “conventional wisdom [within] the policy community” had been shifting in favor of stimulus, “and it might be possible to move that along.” Finally, he noted the likelihood that by year-end the U.S. would have a “significantly less obstructionist” legislature. Around the end of the meeting, Mr. Abe concluded that the “international community must coordinate in the fiscal space and the countries which are able would spend fiscally. … After all, this is off the record, Germany has the greatest space … I will have to … persuade them how they will come along with the policy for further fiscal mobilization.” Thu, 04/28/2016 - 13:29 | 7488719 The Saint Thu, 04/28/2016 - 13:30 | 7488740 Backin2006 Thu, 04/28/2016 - 13:39 | 7488798 thesonandheir Hey, if anyone is in Pearl Harbour vicinity at the moment - I'd get the hell out if I were you. Thu, 04/28/2016 - 13:51 | 7488847 NoDebt Funny, when I read this all I hear is: "This is how we save our own elite asses and preserve the status quo." Let's say Japan collapses.  Then what?  Everyone is dead?  No.  Just a lot of newly debt-unencumbered assets waiting to be snapped up and put brack into productivity at a much lower cost. I have had a read of it and it looks kosher at first glance. Abe mentions Germany a lot as in they have spare capacity to launch massive fiscal stimulus (stimuli, whatever) and he mentions he is going there before the G7 meeting in Japan at the end of May (26-27). Had a quick search and found Abe is planning to visit Russia as part of a European tour beginning May 1st. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will visit Russia in May, the Kyodo news agency reported on April 28. Abeâ€™s visit to several European countries and Russia will begin on May 1, according to the report. How bad are things if this sort of coordinated, massive fiscal spending is required in addition to the coordinated, massive money printing? We need to create the conditions for wage inflation to take hold.  Wage inflation is the only way to somewhat quickly reduce private and public debt while helping the U.S. worker. 1. Kick all illegal aliens out of the country.  Non-citizens are not allowed to work in the U.S. without proper permission. 2. Sharply reduce work visas such as the H-1B visa program. 3. End or sharply curtail the College Loan program.  In its place give pass-through subsidies for Engineering and Science degrees directly through the institutions to reduce tuition for those degree students.  Universities will have to meet strict cost and acreditation requirements to qualify for the subsidies.  Do the same for some necessary skilled trades These steps will 1)Reduce the workforce by limiting it to U.S. Citizens, 2)Educate the workforce in the skills needed by employers and 3)Create competition in the workforce for skilled labor driving up wages. Trump's plan to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. by changing "Free Trade" to "Fair Trade" so the U.S. isn't getting the shaft in this area from the rest of the world will also help the worker.

They see that in a healthy and prosperous economy that there is lots of money flying about. They mistake that superficial appearance for the cause (savings and capital investment) of prosperity. So the Krugman Keynesian Kargo Kultists throw enormous quantities of paper tickets (fake money) about the place in the hope of causing real wealth to be created. It's like a beggar wearing a top hat and claiming that he's in the 1%. Thu, 04/28/2016 - 13:28 | 7488725 jamesmmu I think DOJ did nothing is the worst possible news for stocks. It hints helicopter money is illegal and it probably applies to EU and the Fed, I believe Dow was dropping as much as -150 is not remotely enough to adjust to this horrible bad news. I think this sell off will officially kick off this afternoon. It means central banks have very little room to go with their tools. Thu, 04/28/2016 - 13:28 | 7488727 south40_dreams Krugman is a witless hack who, like his hero obama, was gifted a nobel for no rational reason, and now thinks he is God's gift to......everything.  The NYT is largely unreadable due to his pompous drivelings.   Thu, 04/28/2016 - 13:30 | 7488737 Philo Beddoe Thu, 04/28/2016 - 13:30 | 7488738 tmosley Get rid of regulation and stop meddling in the economy. THAT is what ended the Depression. It was a change in mindset by those in charge. They had a war to prosecute, and couldn't be bothered to keep messing with the economy. Thu, 04/28/2016 - 13:31 | 7488746 RopeADope Entrepreneurs will abandon their â€œdeflationary mindsetâ€? and â€œstart making capital investments.â€? when there is a brass ring to be grabbed. What has become readily apparent is the old trick of waving money in front of entrepreneurs no longer works. Central Bank actions have delegitimized money to such an extent that entrepreneurs are looking for other rewards before taking on the risk of investment. Thu, 04/28/2016 - 13:34 | 7488747 nakki Whats wrong with an occasional recession. Looks like micro managing an economy creates decades of no or slow growth. One sided free trade agreements, and CEO'S and CB'S leveraging up balance sheets just consolidates wealth Thu, 04/28/2016 - 13:35 | 7488752 runnymede Unintended, but entirely foreseeable consequences. The hubris and greed of the central planners is only surpassed by the gullibility of the mass man. It's the recipe for catastrophe.  Thu, 04/28/2016 - 13:35 | 7488759 ToSoft4Truth A young man and his hot date were parked on a back road some distance from town.  They were about to have sex when the girl stopped. "I really should have  mentioned this earlier, but I'm actually a whore and I charge $20 for  sex."  The man reluctantly paid her, and they did their thing. After a cigarette, the man just sat in the driver's seat looking out the  window. "Why aren't we going anywhere?" asked the girl. "Well, I should have mentioned this before, but I'm actually a taxi driver, and the fare back to town is $25..."

They will simply double down on the stupidity. The select few are getting too rich off this for them to ever stop until a boiled rope or a nail gun finds them.

The first problem he's going to run into, though, is that Venezuala credit is so wrecked that no one will lend them the money to buy the paper to print new money. How ya gonna get around THIS one, Krugster? Maybe he could announce that Venezuala is now a cashless society and everyone should just visualize their virtual fiat money inflating at 720 percent per year. Thu, 04/28/2016 - 13:44 | 7488822 Theonewhoknows More woar, more printing!!! Welcome to new version of democratic socialism - printing/corporate welfare is for everyone - but only for those who we will pick. Free speech is also for everyone unless you disagree with what is happening. Everyone is earning their share in this crony capitalism unless they are banks and big corporations - then Janet can open her purse (*cough* your paid taxes *cough*) and make sure no one goes bankrupt.  There was a song that 'we live in a modern world'. today's world is f****d up version of socialist's wet dream...  If you think it is only happening in Europe - just look what options Janet has when she actually would have to admit that economy is in the gutter   http://independenttrader.org/was-the-last-euphoria-the-harbinger-of-rate-cut-and-qe-in-the-us.html Thu, 04/28/2016 - 13:47 | 7488826 I'm Sorry Wilson Not exactly their fault mind you. But ANY 'economic forecasters' that make a profit (for themselves) by peddling 'snake oil' disguised as 'reasearch', in a 100% MANIPULATED counterfeit paper money world, are as bad as the dimwit like Krugman that they criticize. asking a thief for advice makes you a thief also. the fundamental flaws in Krugman's entrie core ethos is that 1) consuming resources without generating sufficient (risk adjusted) positive net cash flow is a good thing 2) never repaying debt is NOT stealing the cast majority of people do not need to be molested by someone with a negative IQ or condescended to that someone else knows better than they do, what needs to be done.
