Prospect Capital's Dividend Projection For November 2015, December 2015, And January 2016 - Prospect Capital Corporation (NASDAQ:PSEC) | Seeking Alpha Following continued requests, this article analyzes PSECâ€™s near-term dividend sustainability by performing four tests based on historical and future quarterly results. The first two tests will analyze PSECâ€™s net investment income and the companyâ€™s cumulative undistributed net investment income which are based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The next two tests will analyze PSECâ€™s net investment company taxable income and cumulative undistributed taxable income which are based on Internal Revenue Code methodologies. It is important for investors to understand the difference between PSECâ€™s net investment income and net investment company taxable income regarding reliable dividend sustainability metrics/projections. Summarized results from the four tests performed within this analysis, including projections for PSECâ€™s next set of dividend declarations, are stated within the â€œConclusions Drawnâ€? section of the article. Author's Note: This article is a detailed look at Prospect Capital Corp.'s (NASDAQ: PSEC ) "near-term" dividend sustainability. I have performed this analysis due to the number of readers who have specifically requested such an analysis be periodically performed on PSEC. For readers who just want the summarized conclusions/results, I would suggest to scroll down to the "Conclusions Drawn" section at the bottom of the article. Due to management's recent rhetoric regarding a delay to PSEC's three proposed spin-offs (now trying to be finalized by the end of the calendar year 2015 - first half of the calendar year 2016), I believe this near-term dividend sustainability analysis can be performed. The focus of this article is to provide a detailed analysis with supporting documentation (via four tests) on the near-term dividend sustainability of PSEC. This analysis will be provided after a brief overview of PSEC's regulated investment company ("RIC") classification per the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC"). After the discussion of this topic, I will be performing four dividend sustainability tests. The first two tests will focus on PSEC's net investment income ("NII"). These two tests will be termed "TEST 1" and "TEST 2". The next two tests will focus on PSEC's net investment company taxable income ("ICTI"). These two tests will be termed "TEST 3" and "TEST 4". At the end of this article, there will be a conclusion based on the results obtained from TEST 1, TEST 2, TEST 3, and TEST 4 about the near-term dividend sustainability of PSEC. I will also provide my projection regarding PSEC's monthly dividend per share rate for November 2015, December 2015, and January 2016 (to be paid in December 2015, January 2016, and February 2016, respectively). Understanding the tax and dividend payout characteristics of PSEC will provide investors with an overall better understanding of the business development company ("BDC") sector as a whole. From reading this article, investors will better understand how a RIC per the IRC comes up with the company's current dividend rate and specific signs when an impending increase or decrease should occur. Side Note: It should be noted PSEC's fiscal year-end, based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), is June 30th of a given year. However, PSEC's tax year-end, based on IRC methodologies, is August 31st of a given year. Readers should understand there is a two-month "gap" per se between PSEC's GAAP fiscal year-end and the company's IRC tax year-end when the analysis is presented below. In prior articles, I have discussed PSEC's RIC classification per the IRC in detail. This included specific provisions that PSEC must adhere by to remain in RIC compliance. There is one specific provision which pertains to PSEC's dividend sustainability analysis that should be mentioned. As a RIC, PSEC is required to distribute to shareholders at least 90% of the company's "ICTI" and "net capital gains" (in excess of its "capital loss carryforward" balance; if applicable) in any given tax year in order to be eligible for the tax benefits allowed in regards to this type of entity (dividends paid deduction at the corporate level). When these two figures are combined, this comprises PSEC's net ICTI which is also known as the company's annual distribution requirement ("ADR"). There is one specific "exclusion" to this rule which is mentioned later in the article (the "spillback provision"). Readers can look back to the following Main Street Capital Corp.'s (NYSE: MAIN ) article for a further discussion of this topic: PSEC's management team has either stated or implied the company's dividend is mainly based on the following two factors: First Factor: Intend to cover the company's dividend payout level with NII (currently, the company's "minimum expected NII" over the foreseeable future). Second Factor: Intend to cover the company's annual dividend payout level with net ICTI. The first factor will focus on PSEC's NII and cumulative undistributed NII and be analyzed via TEST 1 and TEST 2, respectively. The second factor will focus on PSEC's net ICTI and cumulative undistributed taxable income ("UTI") and be analyzed via TEST 3 and TEST 4, respectively. Readers should understand these distinctions as the four tests are presented and analyzed below. First Main Factor - Intend to Cover the Company's Dividend Payout Level with NII: To test management's first main factor, I believe it is necessary to first analyze and discuss PSEC's past quarterly NII figures to see if the company's dividend distributions were covered. This will lead to a better understanding of the overall trends regarding this particular factor and possible future pitfalls that may arise. This includes PSEC using the company's cumulative undistributed NII balance on any quarterly NII overpayments. Table 1 below shows PSEC's NII from the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015 going back to the company's fiscal first quarter in 2014. Table 1 then compares PSEC's quarterly NII figure to the company's dividend distributions figure showing the quarterly underpayment (overpayment). Table 1 below then shows PSEC's quarterly cumulative undistributed NII (deficit) balance for the same time frames. (Source: Table created entirely by me, partially using PSEC data obtained from the SEC's EDGAR Database ) Table 1 will be the main source of information as TEST 1 and TEST 2 are analyzed below. Now let us begin PSEC's near-term dividend sustainability analysis. TEST 1 - Quarterly NII Versus Quarterly Distributions Analysis: - See Red References "C, D, E, (D / C)" in Table 1 Above Next to the June 30, 2015 Column Using Table 1 above as a reference, I take PSEC's quarterly "NII" figure (see red reference "C") and subtract this amount by the quarterly "distributions from NII" figure (see red reference "D"). If PSEC's red reference "C" is greater than the company's red reference "D", then PSEC technically had enough quarterly NII to pay out the company's dividend distributions for a particular quarter. Any excess NII left over, after accounting for the dividend distributions, would be added to PSEC's cumulative undistributed NII (deficit) balance. This particular balance will be further discussed within TEST 2 later in the article. If PSEC's red reference "C" is less than the company's red reference "D", then the company technically did not have enough quarterly NII to pay out its dividend distributions for a particular quarter and must use a portion of the remaining cumulative undistributed NII (deficit) balance to help with the overpayment. Still using Table 1 above as a reference, PSEC had NII of $94.5, $91.3, $87.4, and $89.5 million for the fiscal first, second, third, and fourth quarters of 2015, respectively. In comparison, PSEC had dividend distributions of ($114.3), ($118.2), ($99.4), and ($89.7) million for the fiscal first, second, third, and fourth quarters of 2015, respectively. When calculated, PSEC had an overpayment of NII of ($19.8), ($26.9), ($12.0), and ($0.2) million for the fiscal first, second, third, and fourth quarters of 2015, respectively (see red reference "(C - D) = E"). This calculates to a dividend distributions payout ratio of 121%, 129%, 114%, and 100% for the fiscal first, second, third, and fourth quarters of 2015, respectively (see red reference "(D / C)"). As such, I believe it can be determined PSEC materially overpaid the company's NII during the fiscal first, second, and third quarters of 2015 while matching dividend distributions to NII during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015. When looking at the dividend distributions payout ratio from the fiscal first quarter of 2014 to the fiscal second quarter of 2015, one can see this ratio gradually net increased. In my opinion, considering TEST 1 on a "stand-alone basis", this evidence helps support PSEC's material monthly dividend per share rate reduction which began in February 2015. With that being said, it should also be noted PSEC's dividend distributions payout ratio decreased from 129% during the fiscal second quarter of 2015 to 100% during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015. This recent "matching of NII" was mainly due to the fact PSEC materially reduced the company's monthly dividend rate to $0.0833 per share beginning in February 2015. I believe this reduction in PSEC's quarterly dividend distributions payout ratio should be seen as a positive trend. Now let us take this analysis a step further and perform TEST 2. TEST 2 - Cumulative Undistributed NII Coverage of Quarterly Dividend Distributions Ratio Analysis: - See Red References "D, F, (F / D)" in Table 1 Above Next to the June 30, 2015 Column Once again using Table 1 above as a reference, I take PSEC's "cumulative undistributed NII (deficit)" figure (see red reference "F") and divide this amount by the quarterly "distributions from NII" figure (see red reference "D"). From this calculation, PSEC's "cumulative undistributed NII coverage of quarterly dividend distributions ratio" is obtained (see red reference "(F / D)"). The higher this ratio is, the more positive the results regarding PSEC's near-term dividend sustainability. Basically, this ratio shows the amount of cumulative undistributed NII covering the current quarter's dividend distributions (after taking the current month's dividend distributions accrual into account). Continuing to use Table 1 above as a reference, PSEC had a cumulative undistributed NII (deficit) balance of $18.0, ($8.9), ($20.9), and ($21.1) million at the end of the fiscal first, second, third, and fourth quarters of 2015, respectively. This considers the fact PSEC had disclosed prior period adjustments to the company's cumulative undistributed NII of $11.0 and ($4.3) million during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2014 and fiscal first quarter of 2015, respectively. These prior period adjustments generally occur when PSEC performs the company's annual tax return (initial misclassifications by the company). Since these specific adjustments were discussed in prior articles, they will not be discussed within this particular analysis. Having an inverse correlation to the quarterly overpayments of NII shown in TEST 1, PSEC had a cumulative undistributed NII coverage of quarterly dividend distributions ratio of 0.16, (0.08), (0.21), and (0.23) as of 9/30/2014, 12/31/2014, 3/31/2015, and 6/30/2015 respectively. As such, this ratio continued to decrease during the fiscal first, second, third, and fourth quarters of 2015. When looking at the cumulative undistributed NII (deficit) balance from the fiscal first quarter of 2014 to the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015, one can see that this balance materially decreased. PSEC had a cumulative undistributed NII balance of $72.7 million at the end of the fiscal first quarter of 2014. As stated earlier, as of 6/30/2015 PSEC's cumulative undistributed NII (deficit) balance was ($21.1) million. As such, this balance decreased ($93.8) million over the past seven fiscal quarters. When calculated, PSEC had a cumulative undistributed NII coverage of quarterly dividend distributions ratio of 0.84 as of 9/30/2013. As stated earlier, PSEC had a cumulative undistributed NII coverage of quarterly dividend distributions ratio of (0.23) as of 6/30/2015. When calculated, this ratio decreased (1.07) over the past seven fiscal quarters. As of 6/30/2015, this was the lowest cumulative undistributed NII coverage of quarterly dividend distributions ratio I have calculated since I have covered PSEC. In my opinion, considering TEST 2 on a "stand-alone basis", this evidence helps support PSEC's material monthly dividend per share rate reduction which began in February 2015. However, since PSEC's quarterly NII "break-even" began to materially decrease beginning in February 2015 (due to the dividend reduction), I believe what occurred during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015 has heightened importance going forward. During the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015, PSEC's cumulative undistributed NII (deficit) balance only decreased ($0.2) million. As such, PSEC's cumulative undistributed NII coverage of quarterly dividend distributions ratio only decreased from (0.21) to (0.23) during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015. This was the least severe decrease of this balance since the fiscal fourth quarter of 2013. Simply put, PSEC's new monthly dividend distributions rate of $0.0833 per share currently appears to closely match to the company's quarterly NII. Compared to what has occurred over the past two fiscal years in regards to this metric, I believe this should be seen as a positive trend. When looking at the results from TEST 1 and TEST 2, PSEC's recent NII figures appear to support the current monthly dividend distributions rate of $0.0833 per share. However, with that being said, PSEC's margin of safety regarding NII matching quarterly dividend distributions remains narrow. With that being said, TEST 1 and TEST 2 do not specifically account for PSEC's net ICTI figures. As such, TEST 3 and TEST 4 will be performed to gain further clarity on PSEC's near-term dividend sustainability. Now let us analyze and discuss the second main factor PSEC considers when choosing a proper dividend distributions per share rate. Second Main Factor - Intend to Cover the Company's Annual Dividend Payout Level with Net ICTI: To "fully" understand and accurately project a BDC's dividend sustainability, one must understand the subtle differences between a company's NII and net ICTI figures/cumulative balances. NII is a GAAP figure which is based on the accrual method of accounting. ICTI and net ICTI are IRC figures which are "generally" based on the cash method of accounting (some exceptions to this notion but I am keeping it simple for this discussion). In order for PSEC to come up with a proper ICTI figure, there are specific GAAP to IRC adjustments (reversals) that need to be performed each quarter. Income and expense recognition of certain accounting transactions differ between GAAP and the IRC (book versus tax accounting treatments). A majority of PSEC's book to tax differences (either temporary or permanent in nature) consist of the following: 1) deferred financing fees on loans and deferred offering costs in relation to equity offerings; 2) amortization (accretion) of loan/investment premiums (discounts); and 3) timing recognition of interest income on certain loans/investments. There are several additional book to tax adjustments that PSEC periodically recognizes. However, for purposes of this article, further discussion of these additional adjustments is unwarranted. Once PSEC's ICTI is known, one adds all net capital gains to this figure (if a capital loss carryforward does not exist). Net capital gains consist of realized short-term net capital gains in excess of realized long-term net capital losses for each tax year. However, PSEC had a material capital loss carryforward balance as of 8/31/2015 to offset any net capital gains that might arise in the future. As such, this balance will continue to remain $0 for the foreseeable future even if PSEC realizes a material amount of net capital gains on the company's debt/equity investments. After this calculation, PSEC's net ICTI figure is known. Let us now move on with PSEC's near-term dividend sustainability analysis. To test management's second main factor, I believe it is necessary to first analyze and discuss PSEC's past quarterly net ICTI figures to see if the company's quarterly dividend distributions were covered. This will lead to a better understanding of the overall trends regarding this particular factor and possible future pitfalls that may arise. This includes PSEC using the company's cumulative UTI balance on any quarterly net ICTI overpayments. Table 2 below shows PSEC's net ICTI from the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015 going back to the company's fiscal first quarter of 2014. Table 2 then compares PSEC's quarterly net ICTI figure to the company's dividend distributions figure showing the quarterly underpayment (overpayment). Table 2 below then shows PSEC's quarterly cumulative undistributed net ICTI (deficit) and cumulative UTI balances for the same timeframes. Side Note: As stated earlier, PSEC's fiscal year-end, based on GAAP methodologies, is June 30th of a given year. However, PSEC's tax year-end, based on IRC methodologies, is August 31st of a given year. As such, there's a two month gap between PSEC's fiscal and tax year-end. Table 2 is providing IRC information based on fiscal year-end time frames to better compare and contrast cumulative undistributed NII (discussed within TEST 2 above) and cumulative UTI (discussed within TEST 4 below). (Source: Table created entirely by me, partially using PSEC data obtained from the SEC's EDGAR Database [link provided below Table 1]) Table 2 will be the main source of information as TEST 3 and TEST 4 are analyzed below. Now let us begin the next phase of PSEC's near-term dividend sustainability analysis. TEST 3 - Quarterly Net ICTI Versus Quarterly Distributions Analysis: - See Red References "K, D, L, (D / K)" in Table 2 Above Next to the June 30, 2015 Column Using Table 2 above as a reference, I take PSEC's quarterly "net ICTI" figure (see red reference "K") and subtract this amount by the quarterly "distributions from net ICTI" figure (see red reference "D"). If PSEC's red reference "K" is greater than the company's red reference "D", then PSEC technically had enough quarterly net ICTI to pay out the company's dividend distributions for a particular quarter. Any excess net ICTI left over, after accounting for the dividend distributions, would be added to PSEC's cumulative UTI balance. This particular balance will be further discussed within TEST 4 later in the article. If PSEC's red reference "K" is less than the company's red reference "D", then the company technically did not have enough quarterly net ICTI to pay out its dividend distributions for a particular quarter and must use a portion of the remaining cumulative UTI balance to help with the overpayment. Still using Table 2 above as a reference, PSEC had net ICTI of $151.3, $107.8, $93.7, and $96.3 million for the fiscal first, second, third, and fourth quarters of 2015, respectively. In comparison, PSEC had dividend distributions of ($114.3), ($118.2), ($99.4), and ($89.7) million for the fiscal first, second, third, and fourth quarters of 2015, respectively. When calculated, PSEC had an underpayment (overpayment) of net ICTI of $37.0, ($10.4), ($5.7), and $6.5 million for the fiscal first, second, third, and fourth quarters of 2015, respectively (see red reference "(K - D) = L"). This calculates to a dividend distributions payout ratio of 76%, 110%, 106%, and 93% for the fiscal first, second, third, and fourth quarters of 2015, respectively (see red reference "(D / K)"). PSEC had a combined net ICTI underpayment of $27.4 million for the fiscal year 2015. This calculates to an annual dividend distributions payout ratio of 94%. However, this material underpayment is a bit deceiving. PSEC's original net ICTI figure in the fiscal first, second, third, and fourth quarters of 2015 were amended by the company via several prior period adjustments. When including PSEC's two prior period "true-down" adjustments of ($4.3) and ($20.9) million (which were discussed/reconciled in a prior article), one minor prior period "true-up" adjustment of $0.6 million, and most recently a material true-up adjustment of $12.5 million, PSEC's adjusted net ICTI underpayment was $15.3 million for the fiscal year 2015. This calculates to an annual dividend distributions payout ratio of 97%. When looking at the dividend distributions payout ratio from the fiscal second quarter of 2014 to the fiscal fourth quarter of 2014, one can see PSEC materially overpaid the company's dividends. After a material underpayment in the fiscal first quarter of 2015, PSEC materially and modestly overpaid the company's dividends in the fiscal second and third quarters of 2015, respectively. In my opinion, considering TEST 3 on a "stand-alone basis", PSEC's overpayment of dividends from net ICTI in five out of the six fiscal quarters mentioned above was one of the main reasons the company materially reduced its monthly dividend per share rate back in February 2015. However, it should also be noted PSEC's dividend distributions payout ratio decreased from 106% during the fiscal third quarter of 2015 to 93% during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015 (a greater decrease if one considers the prior period adjustments that were accounted for in each respective fiscal quarter). This reduced payout ratio was directly attributable to the new monthly dividend rate of $0.0833 per share (new quarterly dividend rate totaling $0.25 per share). I believe this should be seen as a positive trend. Now let us take this analysis a step further and perform TEST 4. TEST 4 - Cumulative UTI Coverage of Quarterly Dividend Distributions Ratio Analysis: - See Red References "D, N, (N / D)" in Table 2 Above Next to the June 30, 2015 Column Once again using Table 2 above as a reference, I take PSEC's "cumulative undistributed UTI" figure (see red reference "N") and divide this amount by the quarterly "distributions from net ICTI" figure (see red reference "D"). From this calculation, PSEC's "cumulative UTI coverage of quarterly dividend distributions ratio" is obtained (see red reference "(N / D)"). The higher this ratio is, the more positive the results regarding PSEC's near-term dividend sustainability. Basically, this ratio shows the amount of cumulative UTI covering the current quarter's dividend distributions (after taking the current month's dividend distributions accrual into account). Continuing to use Table 2 above as a reference, PSEC had a cumulative UTI balance of $70.5, $39.2, $34.1, and $53.1 million at the end of the fiscal first, second, third, and fourth quarters of 2015, respectively. Again, Table 2 is providing IRC information based on fiscal year-end time frames to better compare and contrast cumulative undistributed NII (discussed within TEST 2 above) and cumulative UTI. One should note for the past eight fiscal quarters PSEC's cumulative UTI balance has been materially higher when compared to the company's cumulative undistributed NII (deficit) balance. As such, this is why I believe net ICTI figures should also be analyzed in any BDC's dividend sustainability analysis. Due to PSEC's recent material dividend reduction, these IRC metrics now provide direct evidence for any potential "special dividends" periodically being declared. The following quote per PSEC's earnings press release for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015 confirms the company's cumulative UTI balance as of 6/30/2015 matches the cumulative UTI balance calculated in Table 2: "…We have generated cumulative distributable income in excess of cumulative dividends to shareholders since Prospect's initial public offering ("IPO") in 2004. From that IPO through June 30, 2015, our distributable income is currently $53.1 million in excess of dividends to shareholders…" Having an inverse correlation to the quarterly underpayments (overpayments) of net ICTI shown in TEST 3, PSEC had a cumulative UTI coverage of quarterly dividend distributions ratio of 0.62, 0.33, 0.34, and 0.59 as of 9/30/2014, 12/31/2014, 3/31/2015, and 6/30/2015 respectively. When looking at the cumulative UTI balance from the fiscal first quarter of 2014 to the fiscal third quarter of 2015, one can see how this balance materially decreased. PSEC had a cumulative UTI balance of $102.7 million at the end of the fiscal first quarter of 2014. As stated earlier, as of 3/31/2015 PSEC's cumulative UTI balance was only $34.1 million. When calculated, this balance decreased ($68.6) million over six fiscal quarters. When calculated, PSEC had a cumulative UTI coverage of quarterly dividend distributions ratio of 1.19 as of 9/30/2013. As stated earlier, PSEC had a cumulative UTI coverage of quarterly dividend distributions ratio of 0.34 as of 3/31/2015. When calculated, this ratio decreased (0.85) over six fiscal quarters. In my opinion, considering TEST 4 on a "stand-alone basis", this evidence helps support PSEC's monthly dividend per share rate reduction which began in February 2015. However, it should also be noted PSEC's cumulative UTI coverage of quarterly dividend distributions ratio increased from 0.34 as of 3/31/2015 to 0.59 as of 6/30/2015. This increased ratio was directly attributable to the new monthly dividend rate of $0.0833 per share (new quarterly dividend rate totaling $0.25 per share). I believe this should be seen as a positive trend. As important, I also project PSEC's net ICTI for the fiscal first quarter of 2016 will be near the company's dividend distributions for the same time frame. For the fiscal first quarter of 2016, I am projecting PSEC had dividend distributions of approximately $89 million. When looking at the results from TEST 3 and TEST 4, I believe the probability of PSEC being able to maintain the company's recent monthly dividend distributions rate of $0.0833 per share has remained relatively unchanged when compared to the prior quarter. Due to the reduced payout level which began in February 2015, including the fact PSEC had an additional "cushion" per se with the company's cumulative UTI balance of $53.1 million as of 6/30/2015, I believe the probability of the company declaring a minor, future special periodic dividend is still a valid consideration. Of course, PSEC's cumulative UTI balance and cumulative UTI coverage of quarterly dividend distributions ratio should be monitored going forward. To sum up the information in this article, four dividend sustainability tests were performed on PSEC. The first two tests were based on PSEC's NII figures which are based on GAAP methodologies. Then next two tests were based on PSEC's net ICTI figures which are based on IRC methodologies. TEST 1 provided the following information in regards to PSEC's NII payout ratio for the fiscal first, second, third, and fourth quarters of 2015, respectively: PSEC's Fiscal Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4 2015 NII Payout Ratio: 121%, 129%, 114%, and 100% TEST 2 provided the following information in regards to PSEC's cumulative undistributed NII coverage of quarterly dividend distributions ratio at the end of the fiscal first, second, third, and fourth quarters of 2015, respectively: PSEC's Cumulative Undistributed NII Coverage of Quarterly Dividend Distributions Ratio as of 9/30/2014, 12/31/2014, 3/31/2015, and 6/30/2015: 0.16, (0.08), (0.21), and (0.23) When looking at the results from TEST 1 and TEST 2 (based on GAAP methodologies), PSEC's recent NII figures appear to support the current monthly dividend distributions rate of $0.0833 per share. However, with that being said, PSEC's margin of safety regarding NII matching quarterly dividend distributions remains narrow. Next, TEST 3 provided the following information in regards to PSEC's net ICTI for the fiscal first, second, third, and fourth quarters of 2015, respectively: PSEC's Fiscal Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4 2015 Net ICTI Payout Ratio: 76%, 110%, 106%, and 93% However, as was discussed above, when including PSEC's two prior period true-down adjustments of ($4.3) and ($20.9) million (which were discussed/reconciled in a prior article), one minor prior period true-up adjustment of $0.6 million, and most recently a material true-up adjustment of $12.5 million, PSEC's adjusted net ICTI underpayment was $15.3 million for the fiscal year 2015. This calculates to an annual dividend distributions payout ratio of 97%. Finally, TEST 4 provided the following information in regards to PSEC's cumulative UTI coverage of quarterly dividend distributions ratio at the end of the fiscal first, second, third, and fourth quarters of 2015, respectively: PSEC's Cumulative UTI Coverage of Quarterly Dividend Distributions Ratio as of 9/30/2014, 12/31/2014, 3/31/2015, and 6/30/2015: 0.62, 0.33, 0.34, and 0.59 When looking at the results from TEST 3 and TEST 4 (based on IRC methodologies), I believe the probability of PSEC being able to maintain the company's recent monthly dividend distributions rate of $0.0833 per share through January 2016 is high (80%). As such, I am projecting PSEC will declare the following monthly dividends when the company reports results for the fiscal first quarter of 2016: Dividend for November 2015 (Paid in December 2015): $0.0833 per share Dividend for December 2015 (Paid in January 2016): $0.0833 per share Dividend for January 2016 (Paid in February 2016): $0.0833 per share Due to the reduced payout level which began in February 2015, including the fact PSEC had an additional "cushion" per se with the company's cumulative UTI balance of $53.1 million as of 6/30/2015, I believe the probability of the company declaring a minor, future special periodic dividend is still a valid consideration but only has a low to fairly modest (25% - 40%) probability of occurring. I believe PSEC wants to have a material cumulative UTI balance for future reporting periods and thus wants to continue using the IRC's spillback provision. For investors with a higher risk tolerance, I currently rate PSEC as a SELL when the company's stock price is trading at less than an excessively material (less than 15%) discount to NAV as of 6/30/2015, a HOLD when trading at or greater than a 15% but less than 20% discount to NAV as of 6/30/2015, and a BUY when trading at or greater than a 20% discount to NAV as of 6/30/2015. As such, for investors with a higher risk tolerance, I currently rate PSEC as a BUY. With that being said, I am projecting the third quarter of 2015 had some volatility in credit markets in general. As such, most BDC peers will likely experience varying levels of investment depreciation. This topic, pertaining to PSEC, will be discussed in a future article. Nevertheless, I believe a material portion of the risk associated with PSEC's investment portfolio is already priced into the company's stock valuation. For investors with a lower risk tolerance, I would continue to wait to initiate a position in PSEC until more specific information is provided regarding the company's potential/pending spin-offs and results are provided in regards to the fiscal first quarter of 2016. Final Note: Each investor's BUY, SELL, or HOLD decision is based on one's risk tolerance, time horizon, and dividend income goals. My personal recommendation will not fit each investor's current investing strategy. I first initiated a position in PSEC in October 2013 at prices ranging from $10.80 to $10.85 per share. Prior to these positions, I did not own PSEC as an investment. I took both cash and reinvested stock dividends depending on PSEC's stock price when the company's monthly dividends were distributed. On 7/28/2014, I sold 50% of my position in PSEC at a price of $11.00 per share. On 8/26/2014, I sold my remaining position in PSEC at a price of $10.69 per share (initial goal was to obtain a price of at least $10.75 per share) due to the disappointing results reported by the company after markets closed on 8/25/2014. This disclosure was originally provided within subsequent PSEC articles, at the time, over the next several months. On 8/27/2015, I once again initiated a position in PSEC at a weighted average purchase price of $7.325 per share. This weighted average per share price excludes all dividends received/reinvested.
