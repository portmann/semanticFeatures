Northrop Grumman Is Our Other Favorite Defense Contractor - Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) | Seeking Alpha Ben Strubel , Strubel Investment Management (125 clicks) Defense spending may be nearing cyclical low. Air Force and Navy programs are being prioritized by DoD. Northrop's strength in aerospace and maritime electronic systems matches up with DoD's priorities. Over the past few years we've written a few articles about one of our long time holdings, Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT ) but we haven't written anything about the other defense contractors we held. The other defense contractor we own (we've sold Raytheon (NYSE: RTN ) and BAE System (OTCPK: BAESY ) from most client's portfolios) is Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC ). Despite Northrop's price appreciation over the last few years we still believe it is an attractive company to own for multiple reasons. We believe that defense spending may be nearing a cyclical low and we like Northrop's strengths in the important aerospace and maritime (via electronic systems) areas. Northrop is also the second largest contractor on the massive F-35 program. We've written about the F-35 program extensively in a previous article on Lockheed Martin . We will not rehash why we view that program as a positive for Northrop here as it would be substantially the same content as our F-35/Lockheed article so if you're interested in our view on that program check out our article on Lockheed. The biggest overhang on the defense contracting sector has been the declining and then flatling Department of Defense (NYSEARCA: DOD ) budget. However, it looks like that trend is about to change. The graphic below shows the DoD's FY2016 budget request along with their projections out to FY2020. (Source: DoD FY2016 Budget Request Presentation ) We can see that starting this year the important base budget will rise (if their request is enacted) by $38B and it is projected to continue rising out to 2020. It's also worth noting that the DoD's budget requests are typically very close to the actual level of spending with lawmakers in Congress and the Senate often tacking on extra funding for budget line items that benefit their home state or Congressional district. The DoD with the help of Congress has also shifted some normal funding into the OCO (Overseas Contingency Operations) budget to escape sequestration. The DoD states in their presentation that they will shift some of those costs into the base budget if sequestration is lifted. From the DoD presentation linked to above: Another reason to be optimistic about defense spending in the future is that it appears we are very close to a cyclical bottom in defense spending. The chart below shows defense spending as a percentage of the Federal budget. (Source: DoD FY2016 Budget Request Presentation ) As you can see defense spending is pretty much at an all time low of 14.3% of the budget. With the global war on terror showing no signs of slowing down and both Democrats and Republicans agreeing on the need for increased defense spending in the future there is enough headroom in the Federal budget to accommodate increases in defense spending. I say there is headroom in the budget because it seems to be the one area where both political parties are willing to use deficit spending to fund as you very rarely hear of either party wanting revenue or spending cut offsets elsewhere to fund defense spending. The other thing to keep in mind about the DoD budget is that, as usual, procurement and RDT&E (Research, Design, Testing, and Evaluation) are being favored over increased spending on personnel and housing. The graphic below shows the increase in spending for each budget category. (Source: DoD FY2016 Budget Request Presentation ) The Procurement and RDT&E line items are where defense contractors receive the bulk of their revenue with the Operations and Maintenance line item coming in an extremely distant third. We can see that Procurement and RDT&E make up over half ($20.4B) of this year's requested budget increase. So, it's important to keep in mind when viewing the DoD's budgets that new weapons systems are given priority for increased spending and the bulk of the projected spending increases that are being projected in the next half decade will filter down through to the defense contracting industry as profit. Northrop Has Strength in Key Budget Areas While things are looking brighter for all defense contractors the particular reason we like Northrop Grumman is due to its sizeable role in US Air Force and US Navy weapons systems. The primary way the United States projects military power globally is via the air and the sea. Thus, the US Air Force and the US Navy tend to receive budget priority (sometimes explicit and sometimes not) and receive a lion's share of defense funding. With the advent of unmanned drones and the ability to carry out strikes without putting US service members in harm's way the Air Force in particular has become even more important. We can see this focus playing out in how the budget is allocated among each service. The chart below shows the spending increase for each service. (Source: DoD FY2016 Budget Request Presentation ) The Air Force is getting the largest increase this year at $16B and the Navy second at almost $12B. We can also look at the military's budget priorities by examining what systems they are modernizing. The graphic below shows how the $177.5B the military will spend on modernization programs is being divvied up. (Source: DoD Program Acquisition Cost by Weapons System Presentation ) We can see that a majority of the modernization funding is going towards aviation, space/missile defense, and shipbuilding. Like Lockheed Martin, these are the areas that Northrop is strong in as well. We can also look at the breakdown of the important procurement and RDT&E budget proposal to see where that money is being spent (there is obviously a lot of overlap from the modernization budget). (Source: DoD Program Acquisition Cost by Weapons System Presentation ) Again we can see just how much more important aircraft, ship building, and space/missile defense is to the DoD. Indeed, those categories make up a huge majority of the procurement and RDT&E budget. As we mentioned these are the areas that Northrop is the strongest. In particular Northrop is the primary contractor for the RQ-4 Global Hawk drone, the EA-18G electronic warfare suite, E-2D Advanced Hawkeye aircraft, the Space-Based Infrared System (satellites used for missile launch detection), AH-64E electronics integration, the second largest contractor for the F-35 and F/A-18, and one of the contractors receiving funds for developing the next long range strike bomber (LRS-B). Looking at Northrop's latest 10-K we see that a majority of the company's sales and backlog are derived from its Aerospace Systems and Electronic Systems segments (highlighted in green below) To see what the future holds for these segments we can look at the funding for Northrop's biggest programs in the DoD's budget. The table below shows the funding changes from FY2015 to the FY2016 request for those major programs. In total funding for these key programs is projected to increase almost 26%, well above the increases in the base DoD budget. Given Friday's bad jobs report, uncertainty over China, confusion over a potential Fed rate hike, and volatility in the commodities markets owning a defense contractor, even if some of the future growth is priced in, could be a good idea. With defense spending likely nearing a cyclical bottom and Northrop's strong position in key DoD program's the stock is one of our favorites.
