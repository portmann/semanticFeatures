Mixed Responses To Retail Earnings, But Sector Likely To Get Hammered | Seeking Alpha Nordstrom performance not a good sign for retail industry. Big ticket items the stars this year - rest may suffer. How much is left over for retail after auto debt, vacation spending? Why Kohl's shouldn't be considered a representation of the retail industry - at least not yet. Consumers spending less on eating out, reinforcing a tighter consumer spending market. The usual point and counterpoint associated with disappointing earnings results have quickly emerged concerning the retail sector, as company after company underperformed in October, pointing to a probable disappointing holiday season in the U.S. On the surface it would appear there are not only mixed outlooks, but mixed results, which under normal retail conditions would signal companies that are being run better than others. It doesn't look like that's what's happening in the current retail environment, even though Kohl's (NYSE: KSS ) and JCPenney (NYSE: JCP ) beat expectations, while Macy's (NYSE: M ) and Nordstrom (NYSE: JWN ) had poor results in the last quarter. There are several major factors I see that point to this being a real cut back on spending by consumers, rather than a temporary slowdown. Among those are the huge amount of auto debt held by consumers, lower spending at restaurants, vacation spending, and focus on bigger ticket items in general at the expense of other products. Finally, I believe Nordstrom is the bellwether of the industry to look at because it has done so well for so long, and its expected annual loss was the first it has experienced in 7 years. I would have included Macy's in the same category, as it has had a good run over the last several years as well. The problem there is it has developed some problems unique to the company, so it would have faced challenges even if the sector remained robust. What consumers have been spending on It's no secret consumer spending have been driven by the auto industry, which has been getting people into vehicles with easy terms and extended loans. That has been the major catalyst in the sector. That has increased consumer debt to the point it may have now peaked, which is why in the busiest retail season of the year they have tightened their wallets and purses. Another factor has been the low price of gas has encouraged more vacationing, which has eaten up more disposable income. Big ticket items in general have been the targets of consumers, which, when combined with the other factors mentioned above, has I draw my conclusion on consumers being tighter also upon the fact there has also been a declining number of consumers going out to eat. This can't be a coincidence when taking into account weak consumer spending at the retail level. Also important to note is U.S. auto sales are dropping as well ; another metric confirming we should lower expectations for fourth-quarter consumer spending. It was good news for Kohl's that they had a surprising beat in its last quarter, but I don't consider the company representative of the retail sector. After four years of its share price doing nothing, it did have its big jump, starting in July 2014, where it soared from a little over $51 per share to $79 per share by the end of March 2015. Since then it has plummeted down further than it had moved up, where as I write it is trading for under $43 per share. It hasn't moved in conjunction with the overall industry, and the exception of that 7-month period, it is trading lower than it did 5 years ago. For that reason and the market believing the last quarter was probably an anomaly, it has lost all it gained after its earnings report, and will probably continue to remain under pressure. Other than strong sales at the beginning of the school year, and a brief surge near the end of October, the quarter wasn't that impressive. That said, the company will have to prove over the next several quarters it has made a lasting improvement in its performance. Investors also know things have changed quickly in retail since that reporting period, and Kohl's is not likely to surprise to the upside in the fourth quarter. There were some positives for Kohl's in the quarter, but we have to wait to see if it was an anomaly at the tail end of consumer spending strength.

It still remains an attempted turnaround story that isn't a sure thing. I don't consider the weakness of JCPenney something that has happened as a result of the decrease in consumer spending. Like Macy's, it has problems unique to the company that have to be resolved. Macy's has been inconsistent recently, after a nice 7-year run after closing on October 31, 2008 at $7.42 per share, and soaring almost 700 percent to close at over $69 per share on June 30, 2015. Since then it has also given a lot of that back, plummeting to $39.10 at the close of November 13. Part of the problem is the closing of stores, which in the most recent quarter resulted in an impairment charge of $111 million. There is also the ongoing problem of a decline in same-store sales, which last quarter was down 3.6 percent, while overall sale dropped 5.2 percent. How I view this in light of the slowdown in consumer spending is it's not indicative of the industry as a whole because of the exposure it has to the tourist market, which is where a lot of its volume and profitability come from. Most other retailers don't have this vulnerability, and so I consider something unique to the company. There are many other issues, but I'm only looking at these retailers and whether or not they represent an industry downturn. (click to enlarge) source: StockCharts.com That leads me to Nordstrom, which I believe is a good representative of the retail industry, and for that reason is a cause of concern. To different degrees and lengths of time, the companies listed above have had issues unique to their businesses. On the other hand, Nordstrom has been performing well over the last 7 years, and has had good management in place. So when it is heading for its first annual loss in 7 years, it is definitely cause for concern, especially after performing so well over the last several years before starting to reverse course in March 2015. The recent challenge faced by Nordstrom has been traffic to its online and physical stores. Unfortunately for the company, it hasn't been able to give a reason for the decline, which means it will struggle to find a solution. It's also not comforting for investors, who heavily punished the stock after the earnings report. Revenue was up for the company, but in order to attract consumers, it had to steeply discount its products. To me that's another sign of consumer concern. If you're wondering why I didn't include Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ) is there is a lot of clarity on the retail side with those two companies, and Wal-Mart's performance is going to be weak over the next year, and that is also specific to the company as it raises the costs associated with its employees. Amazon of course continues to increase its market share for online retail customers, but that isn't related to the recent downturn in any way. It's a trend beyond the current consumer spending environment. More than likely if retail is under serious pressure, Amazon will feel it, but it will probably be one of the last companies to experience negative consumer feedback in the form of lower spending. Nordstrom on the other hand represents consumer spending at the middle class level, which is where the bulk of consumer spending comes from. My thesis is this is the beginning of a sustainable slowdown in consumer spending, and I don't buy the weather excuses that seem to come immediately after every poor performance in the retail sector. The reason it's not a one-off slowdown is primarily from the heavy debt load consumers now have. The desire for big ticket products, in my opinion, has brought them to the boundaries of their debt comfort zones, or possibly qualification for debt, and for that reason are starting to tighten up and pay down their existing loans and credit cards. Spending in the fourth quarter is probably going to be subdued, and that will continue on into 2016. There is more retail disappointment on the horizon.
