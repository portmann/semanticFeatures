The Macro Method: Part 4 - The Business Of War | Seeking Alpha With the recent tragedies in France, Lebanon, and Egypt, all eyes are now honed in on the Syrian Civil War and the international consensus to combat terrorism has been revitalized. As environmental and socioeconomic conditions continue to worsen in the Middle East and the so-called War on Terror goes global, international defense spending may be on the rise once again. Northrup Grumman, Lockheed Martin, BAE Systems, and Boeing are just some of the major-league defense contractors that can capitalize from this growing trend. Not to mention, there are many smaller players that can benefit from revenue growth, growing defense budgets, and increased M&A activity in the sector. Watch carefully the ongoing G20 summit in Turkey, U.S. LRS-B and F-35 program developments, and upcoming international defense expos such as IDEX/SOFEX, DSEI, and Milipol. The following is part four of an ongoing series, "The Macro Method," on current global economic trends, monetary and fiscal policy, and investment strategy. This method seeks to maximize gains by observing long term and short-term macroeconomic trends, analyzing current events, and interpreting central bank speak. Although no specific details were released, U.S. and Russian diplomats in Vienna and world leaders at the G20 Summit in Antalya, Turkey finally agreed on the need for a ceasefire and U.N.-supported political transition within twelve to eighteen months in regards to the ongoing Syrian civil war. Given the recent surge in terror attacks across the world, it is no surprise that even typically anti-Western governments such as Putin's oligarchy are now eager to coordinate and reach a formal consensus for action in the Middle East, at least in the context of immediate international counterterrorism concerns in Iraq and Syria. However, even though it seems the international community may finally have reached a concrete consensus on counterterrorism, the fight will be long and arduous and likely decades-long, especially considering how long it has taken the international community to reach agreement on specific security issues in the past. Since its peak in 2010, defense spending in the U.S. has suffered some major blows, falling by about 19% in total, due to the constant gridlock in Congress and subsequent sequester cuts. However, with defense spending set to rise by approx. $38 billion for FY2016 (excluding OCO funds) in the U.S. and the House of Saud to increase its military spending by 27% over the next five years, for example, international defense spending may be on the rise once again. Many of the large defense conglomerates and smaller independent contractors should be able to capitalize on this spike in defense spending across the world, including Northrup Grumman (NYSE: NOC ), Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT ), BAE Systems ( OTCPK:BAESY ), Boeing (NYSE: BA ), General Dynamics (NYSE: GD ) and Orbital ATK (NYSE: OA ) for example. By examining the objectives and estimates provided by the current administration's defense secretariat, we can try to see if this spike in defense spending in the U.S. will be sustained. Maintain a strong commitment to security and stability in Europe and the Middle East Sustain a global approach to countering violent extremists Reinvigorate efforts to build innovative partnerships We can already see a number of these objectives that have started to come to fruition such as the so-called "Asia Pivot", the shift in defense spending to technology over arms and personnel build-up, and the efforts to sustain international efforts and coalitions to combat terrorism as opposed to unilateral approaches. As for the actual budget, there are some key components of the budget to take note of especially in relation to potential growth for defense contractors. For example, the highest areas of growth in the new federal budget for FY2016 are in the Air Force and Navy branches; this is to be expected as the U.S. primarily projects its military power through air and naval dominance. (Source: Office of the Under Secretary of Defense) Another key component of the budget to take note of is that of the distribution of funding on the modernization of certain major weapons systems. Totaling $177.5 billion, the major areas for funding are primarily in aircraft, space/missile defense, and naval systems. Considering that, for companies like Northrup or Boeing or Lockheed, a majority of their revenue comes from the sales of aerospace systems, naval electronics systems, etc., this is a positive development - that the DoD is continuing to prioritize spending on its air and naval capabilities. Certain other developments regarding federal funding should also be watched carefully, for example, the LRS-B (Long Range Strike Bomber) program. Many articles here on Seeking Alpha and on global news outlets have covered this story, from Lockheed's perspective to Northrup's recent marketing campaign . As of Nov. 12th, Northup officially halted all work orders for its new stealth bombers after Boeing and Lockheed formally protested the Air Force's decision. Now, the decision falls on the U.S. Government Accountability Office as it debates on the impartiality of the selection process. It will likely take several months for the government to come to a final decision, however, it is likely that Northrup will be allowed to continue with its awarded contract. This is key as the LRS-B program could be worth upwards of $80 billion for Northrup. Another interesting development to watch is the new contract for Lockheed Martin's F-35 Lightning II fighter jets. While Lockheed has won a preliminary contract to build 55 new fighter jets with $625 million in new immediate funding and the total value of the contract placed at $5.37 billion, the F-35 has become something of a symbol of military excess, especially among the far corners of the political left and right. The Pentagon is eager to build upwards of "2,457 jets...[and wants to spend] $391 billion to develop the plane"; however, former political outcasts that have been garnering significant grassroots support such as Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders have railed against the U.S.'s exorbitant defense spending and signaled they may take action, particularly against the F-35 program - "the epitome of Pentagon waste." Even Canada's newly elected Liberal government announced its intentions to scrap the orders for nine new fighter jets valued at $9 billion, potentially costing the program's other partner countries billions in added costs. If you look at the defense spending levels for Western advanced economies such as the U.S. or U.K., generally spending does not increase/decrease by large margins. As an example, U.K. defense spending is expected to remain steady as usual at around $68.5 billion as it has for the past five years. In contrast, the most growth in defense spending is expected to come from the emerging/developing economies, such as in North Africa, East Asia, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East. Now, while the emerging market rout and commodity crisis that took place this summer may have had an impact on the spending ambitions of those emerging economies particularly smaller Gulf states, if anything, these crises have only spurred on these countries to pursue faster their ascent into higher status through military prominence. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute , "It is unclear what impact the sharp fall in the price of oil in late 2014 may have on the large rises in military spending that have taken place in many oil producing countries in the Middle East, parts of Africa and Asia, and Russia among others. While some producers, such as Saudi Arabia, have built up large financial reserves that will enable them to withstand lower prices for some time, others may be more affected, and indeed Russia has already cut its military spending plans for 2015 as a result." --SIPRI In spite of these recent financial woes, the long-term trend of massive spending increases in these regions (in both real terms and % of GDP terms) is still on track to continue. Saudi Arabia is likely going to be the most important player to watch among the emerging economies. Since 2011, the House of Saud has been increasing defense spending by nearly 20% every year; and if oil prices recover, its spending is projected to be nearly $62bn by 2020, or the fifth-largest military expenditure in the world. With defense spending in both development/export and sales set to increase in the last half of this decade, investing in some of these aerospace giants or arms dealers may prove to be a lucrative investment. It should prove useful to watch upcoming important expositions/trade shows such as SOFEX in Jordan or IDEX in the UAE to see some of the newest marketed defense products or strategic regimens. 16 of the 20 largest arms manufacturers in the world are based in the United States so it will be important to also watch key political developments there as well, such as with the F-35 or LRS-B programs. Another useful tool for observing and predicting military expenditure is the SIPRI MILEX database , which compiles data on military spending on 171 countries since 1988. Stocks for companies like Lockheed or Boeing or Orbital will likely reflect this "bullish" trend in defense spending (with exceptions of course) going into 2020, especially with all of the violent domestic and international turmoil the world faces from terrorists and insurgencies. This inevitable clash between the forces of liberalism and forces of terror has regalvanized the global counterterrorist agenda, and well, for good or for naught, let's just say the "military-industrial complex" is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend. In fact, as of Nov. 16th, the first market opening since Friday's attacks in Paris, aerospace/defense stocks popped up significantly, for example, with OA up +6.02% and NOC up +4.36% by market close. Not to even mention their consistent rising dividends or increasing cash flows, I think it's safe to say that investing in these defense sector companies will be a decent bet in the last half of this decade.
