Also, please remember that some of the issues being discussed during this webcast might include forward-looking statements which are provided by the Corporation with the usual caveats. These caveats or risks and uncertainties are outlined in our financial reporting. Therefore, our future results could differ from the information discussed today. I will now turn this presentation over to Mr. Brian Hannasch, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Raymond Pare, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Gentlemen, please go ahead. Thank you, Christina. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for listening on this webcast covering Couche-Tard's fourth quarter fiscal 2015. Here with is Raymond Pare, Vice President and CFO. As normal, we will run through the results and offer some background information before answering the questions that you submitted earlier today. Again this quarter, we are excited to share with you what we think are some very strong results and exceptional achievements in terms of network growth. The fourth quarter increase of 15.4% in adjusted net earnings was a great way to end what we believe was an exceptional fiscal year. In all of our markets, we recorded strong organic growth while maintaining our solid profit margins. In the US, we've experienced our strongest growth since the beginning of the financial crisis in 2008. In Europe, we continued to benefit from the rollout of our proprietary Miles fuel brand which continues to gain traction and perform well against the market as well as from the new extra loyalty program that we've implemented this past year. Fiscal 2015 was marked by strong volume performance and higher fuel margins. And our efforts in the stores also paid off on both continents with strong organic growth on all fronts. We've focused our energy toward improving our product offering and the customer experience. We responded to our customers' desire for fresh and convenient foods by increasing our offer both in terms of quality and quantity. One great example is the rollout of our simply great coffee program in Europe delivering very high quality coffee to the on go consumer. The program is generating positive results with the product rate number one in brand awareness in six to the seven business units that we've measured. We've also stepped up significantly offer private label products. In North America, we've introduced more than 100 private label items since May 2014 with parallel efforts in Europe. Our efforts in this area are paying off on both continents where private label continues to be one of the fastest growth product categories we have. A fine example is our polar pop program which continues to grow in the US and is gaining traction in Canada. On the expense side, the story is also quite exciting. We are happy to report that the significant cost reductions we've recorded during the quarter in Europe allowed us to reach the lower range of the synergies objective we set following the acquisition three years ago in 2012. And w still remain optimistic about our ability to reach the upper range of our objective by the end of this calendar year. This achievement combined with our continuous vigorous cost control in North America allowed us to maintain fiscal 2015 increases and expenses at a level significantly lower than inflation despite some significant organic top line growth. On the development side. Our teams have done an outstanding job in terms of network growth and improvement this year. We completed the construction relocation or rebuilding of 72 stores. In addition to that we added 32 single sites acquired during the year. So in total we are able to add or improve to our existing network by total of 104 sites. On top of that as of April 26, 2015 we had 26 stores under construction that should open in the coming quarters. I'm particularly pleased with the performance of our newly constructed sites and our plans for 2016 are to materially step up our activity in this space. On the acquisition side, we are already working actively on the integration of The Pantry and all indicators we have point toward an impressive contribution potential towards our company's growth. We still estimate that we will able to realize annual cost reductions of a minimum $85 million over next 24 months. And as of today, we've already taken actions that should allow us to record cost reductions of approximately $45 million before tax on annual basis. The fourth quarter of this year was impacted by severances and termination payments and provisions in line with those actions. And those cost reductions are of course in addition of top line growth that we expect to capture through the exchange and implementation of best practices from both companies as well as improved supply conditions. In the three months since closing, we've seen some solid improvement in top line results. Our same store results for the quarter already reflect that positive impact but only for the six week period since the acquisition date. In Europe, we are optimistic and we work hard with the competition authorities to secure successful conclusion to the Dansk Shell acquisition that we announced last quarter. We are looking forward to close this transaction and are still expecting to do so before the end of fiscal 2016. This would be an important and exciting step forward for Couche-Tard in Europe and would help to support our expansion strategy in that continent. Thank you, Brian. Good afternoon, everyone. We are very proud of our fourth quarter's results as Brian mentioned. But even proud of our ability to demonstrate strong and sustained growth quarter after quarter and year after year. Before we go to the numbers keep in mind that The Pantry did not significantly impact the financial performance of the fourth quarter and fiscal 2015 as the acquisition closed toward the end of the fiscal year and the great benefits were offset by the non- recurring integration cost as shown in line with the action taken to support our cost reduction objectives. Net earnings were $129.5 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of $15.6 million was due to the earning per share stood at $0.23. Some items affected the results of the quarter which are described in our MD&A. Once adjusted for these items, Q4 adjusted net earnings stood at $142 million while adjusted diluted earnings per share stood at approximately $0.25, compared to $0.22 for the corresponding quarter of 2014, a strong increase of 13.6%. For fiscal 2015, net earnings posted at $933.5 million, an increase of $121.3 million while diluted net earnings per share stood at $1.64 compared to $1.43 the previous year, an increase of 14.7%. Adjusted net earnings for the fiscal year reached $1,022.0 million, up $256 million, an increase of 33.4% while adjusted diluted earnings per share stood at approximately $1.80, an increase of 33.3%. Another solid and record year. This increase is attributable to continued organic growth and higher fuel margins as well as the contribution from our recent acquisition. These items were offset in part by the strengthening of the US dollars against the corporation other functional currency and by higher income tax rate. These great results definitely show the strength of our business model, our culture and our geographic diversification. Instead of repeating the MD&A which is available on SEDAR, I'll quickly highlight some of the key indicator for the quarter and fiscal 2015. It should be noted that The Pantry stores are included on the following same store and margin numbers since the acquisition date. For the fourth quarter, same store merchandize sales increased by 5.2% in the United States, by 3.8% in Canada and by 3% in Europe. Our performance is attributable to our dynamic merchandizing strategies, our competitive offer as well as to our expanded fresh offering which is attracting more customers in our stores. Excluding the negative impact from currency translation, for the fourth quarter our consolidated merchandized and service gross profit grew by $113.9 million, an impressive increase of 18.5%. The gross margin was 33.4% in the US, 42.1% in Europe and 32.5% in Canada for consolidated margin of 34.1%. Overall this performance reflects changes in the product-mix, the improvements we brought to our supply terms as well as our merchandising strategy in line with market competitiveness and economic conditions within each market. As for fiscal 2015, same store merchandize revenue increased by 3.9%, by 3.4% in Canada and by 2% in Europe. During the same period and still excluding the negative impact of the currency translation, our consolidated merchandize and service gross profit grew by $201 million or 7.4%. On a fuel side, during the fourth quarter same store volumes increased by 6.4% in the United States, by 3.7% in Europe and by 1.5% in Canada. This performance is due amongst other things to our micro-market pricing strategy to improve fuel retail's execution as well as the contribution of Miles, our proprietary fuel brand in Europe. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we posted road transportation fuel gross margin of $15.46 per gallon in the US and CA$6.18 per litre in Canada. Both on the rise while in Europe the fuel margin was $8.55, a decrease compared to last year but this drop in our European fuel margin is explained by the negative impact of the foreign exchange translation into US dollars as a currency of presentation. In local currency, the fuel margin in Europe was higher than that for the fourth quarter and for the full fiscal year. As for fiscal 2015, same store road transportation fuel volume increased by 3.4% in the United States, by 2.4% in Europe while it did decrease by 0.1% in Canada. Our smaller market in term of volume. Margin posted at $21.74 per gallon in the US at $10.33 per litre in Europe and at CA$60.35 per litre in Canada. Here again the drop in the European fuel margin as previously mentioned is entirely attributable to the foreign exchange translation. As usual, we continue to favor tight control of cost throughout the organization. Despite significant organic growth in the recording of non-recurring cost during the quarter, our expenses have all remained in line with inflation. We are already actively working on materializing cost reduction opportunities for The Pantry network and are looking forward to benefit from the action that we've already taken. These will be more clearly visible in the upcoming quarter. Excluding the non-recurring items described in our MD&A, adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 increased by $41.9 million or 14% reaching $341.9 million. While adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2015 increased by $322.1 million, or 20.2% compared to the fiscal 2014, reaching $1.9 billion. On pro forma basis including the impact of The Pantry, we are talking about an EBITDA of over $2.1 billion. For fiscal 2015, our income tax rate was 24.7% compared with a rate of 14.2% for the previous fiscal year. Fiscal 2015 was affected by an internal reorganization which increased the income tax expense by $41.8 million. Had this reorganization not been implemented, the income tax rate would have been approximately 21.3%. As for fiscal 2014, the income tax rate was impacted by non-recurring tax recoveries. Excluding this element, the income tax rate for fiscal 2014 would have been 15.5%. The remaining increase is attributable to the higher proportion of our results coming from the United States where the tax rate are higher and related to the reimbursement of our -- an important portion of our debt before the acquisition of The Pantry. This level of tax rate is also in line with the comments that we made in the third quarter then it should be basically see as pretty much aligned with again with the overall year. For next year I know that some of you did ask the question. And the tax rate should be -- I'll see equal to slightly lower than the levels that we did achieve this year. Using the strong free cash flow from our operation and proceed from the dispose of the aviation fuel business we were able to repay a total amount of $900 million on our acquisition facility and our revolving facility during fiscal 2015. These repayments allowed us to record solid leverage ratio despite the fact that we increased our debt by $1.4 billion of the acquisition of The Pantry. As of April 26, 2015, on a pro forma basis for a Pantry acquisition, our adjusted net interest bearing debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.17x. This leaves us ample flexibility to take advantage of investment opportunities and to maintain our strong credit profile. I believe that we could have a better profile and we will keep the pace to convince the credit agency by the continuing our trends in supporting good results and improving our financial position. Our financial strength combined with our excellent track record for acquisitions, allowed us to issue 10 years Canadian dollar denominated senior unsecured notes totaling CA$700 million at a satisfactory conditions at a rate of 3.6%, subsequently to the end of fiscal 2015. We also entered in a cross currency interest rate swap for the same amount allowing us to synthetically convert those Canadian dollars notes into US dollar notes. That proceed were used to reimburse of credit facilities which further improved our financial flexibility by spreading the maturity over time. As expected our returns on capital employed dropped slightly to reach 16.2% on a pro forma basis for The Pantry acquisition. But we are still in the best and class; we are already hard at work bringing it back to a level in line with our usual expectations. Our return on equity reached 24.9% on a pro forma basis and the rise compared to the previous fiscal year. For our beginning 2016 with a great enthusiasm and I am eager to see the benefits from the realization of synergies and other opportunities coming from the acquisition of The Pantry and those still available in Europe. For all of these reasons, we are happy to share the success by increasing our quarterly dividend from $0.045 per share to $0.055 per share on a quarterly basis, an improvement of more than 22%. We will continue to balance our debt structure in order to maintain our solid financial position and stay well positioned to take advantage of any investing opportunity that may present itself. And that conclude my part. Brian? Thank you, Raymond. As I stated in the introduction, I am proud of the result for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year, and the exceptional fiscal year that we just ended. The level of performance and the pride we took out of it allows us to begin our new fiscal 2016 with the momentum we need to achieve the ambitious goals we set for ourselves and our teams. We believe we can turnaround The Pantry's previous trends with strong set growth in sales and volumes in the coming quarters, in addition to achieving the cost reduction targets we previously communicated. In all geographies, our teams are hard at work serving 6 million customers everyday and setting the table for future growth. Whether through the construction new stores, development of introduction new products or the search for the next acquisition. We continually look out for the right investment opportunity that might come up; we are actively working on different promising projects of various sizes, using our disciplined approach both in North America and in Europe. The next few months we anticipate being very busy but I am certain even more rewarding. I'd like to conclude by thanking all of our employees for their hard work, this has been a successful year and it would not have been possible without them and for sure that would be the key to our future success. Thank you very much. Q2 saw some very nice comparable trends specially the above 5% in the United States. You note a number of the things you believe account for that with one being the expanded fresh food offer. Can you review for us where you are with that effort, which market, what's new on offer and how stores perform when they convert to expanded fresh food? Also can you -- what can we expect in the next 12 months so with respect to rolling out to other markets and additional stores. That's right. In total we've got about 700 sites of varying maturities that we would call FFI. So fresh delivered food, that spectrum would be pastry solid for sandwich, fruit cups things like that. And as I communicated previously we started four five years ago with Arizona and Great Lakes and in recent --really the recent last 18 months expanded that into another 200-250 sites. We feel good about the top line results. We've worked hard this year to optimize the logistics cost and spoilage and our feeling -- continue to feel better and better by their performance and as such as we enter our new fiscal year we plan to add another 300 stores this coming year in a variety of geographies across the US. As we have communicated in the past, we are also pursuing a parallel path of prepared on-site -food, both for our bigger and new industry sites where we have high traffic flows and also more real locations which again we are making fresh food on site. That range is geographically in the south, it could be tacos or burritos to pizzas in the north or calzones things like that. We've launched a pilot three stores in Houston, it is very early but cautiously pleased with results there and goal this year is to add approximately 30 or 40 of those locations this coming fiscal year. No, it is mainly labors and marketing. Timings played a role as well, newly built sites are at higher expenses level than the stores we close. And it as to be noted the fiscal 2015 organic operating expenses increased by only 0.3%. Your same store fuel volumes were the highest we've ever seen in years in the United States. Can you comment on how you have been able to gain market share and your ability to drive similar gains at The Pantry? First I would start saying I don't think I believe we have it again but I think there is some growth in demand in the US today. Fueled by lower fuel prices I think variety of external sources would lead us to believe there is some slightly positive demand. Stronger in some parts of the US than in others. In terms of results themselves, I think it is just continued focus on execution, very consistent pricing, we've really I think transformed our disciplines on how we look at micro market, how we position ourselves vis-à-vis competition. And also aligning with strong brands that have appealed to consumer not only in terms of quality of the product but the payment option they offer, the loyalty programs that they offer and we continue to reap benefits from those . We will see, we are busy with very interesting finds in North America and in Europe. The pipeline remains robust for sure. Let me go back. I am sorry I miss the second half of that question. It extended to go into The Pantry's fuel volume performance and expectations. I would say with The Pantry we believe we have an opportunity materially grow our fuel volume. Starting number one with consistent message to the consumer everyday in terms how we price and optimizing our brands in that portfolio sites. And that will be a little bit longer term activity. But we are optimistic that we can have the same if not better trends in The Pantry. Sorry about that. Merchandize same store sales showed a nice momentum in Q4 across all regions. Can you provide some precisions on the key drivers performance by key categories and the degree to which fresh food contributed to the growth? This is Brian. I will take that. I think that the two strong drivers fro the quarter in way for the year are food; food service was double digit in most of our geographies. Europe, coffee continued to be very strong with a rollout of our simply great coffee offer now approaching almost 800 locations that have been installed. Then the second leg would be beverages. And that's both dispense beverages and in the cooler. Both of this delivered very strong results and really led the way in terms of merchandize growth. The tone in the press release around the potential acquisition sounded nicely optimistic. Can you talk about what are you seeing now in terms of potential acquisitions and evaluation across geographies? And if possible what you see as your balance sheet capacity? I will answer because some of the elements, I did answer to a portion of it exactly what the potential acquisition in the pipeline. In term of evaluation, again the evaluation is kind of varied through the times so we are still basically making transaction basically are looking at transaction at reasonable basically multiple and of course as you can see basically on our balance sheet we have a pretty strong capacity. Our leverage is already down at 2.17, we already have basically and could realize basically and could use our balance sheet and still maintaining a very strong quality -- still maintaining a very strong credit profile but benefiting basically other opportunity or materializing opportunity then we are in a good position right now. Historically The Pantry gasoline margins have been lower than Couche-Tard's US gasoline margins. How wide is that gap? And do you expect it to narrow over time? If so, how rapidly would this occur? So I want to make sure that everybody knows The Pantry is historically reported their fuel margin net of credit card fees and fuel maintenance expense and that's been public disclosure so you can back and do the math, you are excluding that. I don't think difference is in that same geography has been that material. But on an average The Pantry network is more real than we are in the same geography so quite honestly I expect a little higher cent per gallon margin than what we would have achieve in our Southern region. That said we are very active on the entire fuel value chain with Pantry. That includes what brands are going to face the customer with, the cost we are going to pay, the credit card and payment message, the trucking, the fuel variation inventory loss if you will and the pricing tactics. And we believe this material upside to fuel in The Pantry. The second question is your same store gasoline volumes in Europe have grown strongly during the quarter. Is this due to the market share gains or economic environment? Now I'll say for sure the market share basically gain is a big factor. And make some or allow us to make some great progress. Miles and Miles Plus are for sure basically factored to help us realize that. Of course the quality of the execution is also a big factor and the economic environment in general is also a factor but for sure market share gain is a big part of our basically contribution right now on that side. Can you elaborate on the specific areas where you anticipate achieving the $85 million of Pantry synergies; are there potential sources of additional synergies that are not in the $85 million estimate? And if so, what are these potential additional synergies? So when we communicated the $85 million, I think we are very clear that they are expense related and that really falls into the three buckets. Overhead so things like IT accounting, corporate expenses associated with The Pantry being public. Auditor fees, Board fees, those types of things. And then store-related OpEx, that's optimizing labor, banking fees and insurance on and on down the list, using looking at best practices between the two companies. In addition to that certainly top side is material, so growing sales, growing volume, growing traffic and then the other big bucket for us would be fuel procurement and merchandize procurement. Those would be two additional synergies that we have not yet quantified. In the outlook section of the quarterly report you mentioned that in addition to fresh products, you are focusing on introducing new products and services. Can you talk about what these new products and services might be? I'll start by saying that's a never ending journey to continue look for new ways to provide convenience to our consumers. Certainly top of mind right now private label, big launch both in Europe and North America, the last 12 months we've launched over a 100 items in our North American markets and close to corresponding amount in Europe. We've some business unit exceeding 5% of total sales in private label product. So we are very pleased with that. I would say also looking at financial services and also payment. How do we innovate with consumers who want to do different things in our stores? That would be three areas I would point to. And then in Europe, we've a significantly narrow or skew offer in Europe than we would in North America. The entire categories that don't exist in the convenient sector. So we are pushing the envelop there to see what consumers will respond to. An example that was real this year is meat snacks, beef jerky as an example, didn't exist in any of stores, we launched it across Europe but I can't say it's slam dunk success everywhere but we've had some really nice response to some markets. So we are going to continue challenge how broader offers are in Europe and attempt to expand them. You said that normalized operating expenses increased by 2.2% in Q4 mainly due to normal inflation as well as higher expenses needed to support strong organic growth. Are the higher same store sales and higher operating expense growth, I find that you are rolling out the fresh food program at a faster pace now. Can you provide some color on this? It will not qualify the fact that we are accelerating because it was a catalyst for years. And we are still have in front of us basically some great years of work then -- I would say it is pretty balanced, it is for sure focus for us and when this thing basically around this category, it will be case for years. Like Brian did mention our -- the level of growth that we have in this category but saying that's accelerating, I will not go as -- that were going to a faster pace, I will not go as far as that. I will say that we are progressing, we are still focus on it and it will be a catalyst for the year to come. The internal reorganization pushed the tax rate in Q3 and Q4 of fiscal 2015. Can you provide us with some idea as to what we should expect for the tax rate in fiscal 2016? I'll say you should expect the tax rate in line are better than fiscal 2015, slightly better except if we are over achieving on the taxable income in US and if that happen I think that will be good and everyone will be happy with that. See I already answer to the first portion of the question, in term of capital it will be in line with the pro forma of both entity plus, I will see mainly the built up or the acceleration of the --over last year basically of the new built, recently built relocation, single site acquisition. As mentioned last year, it will accelerate and will built up basically over the next years -- the pace of this element versus basically let say the year before, the one that we just finished. We don't provide necessarily this kind forward statement or exact basically percentage but for sure we still have a synergies and improvement to materialize in SG&A basically in Europe, in North America with The Pantry that we did recently. But even with our overall organization, we still have subject for the following year where we are still again challenging ourselves in order to build and to find ways basically to become more and more efficient than -- this is a journey like any other thing that we are doing in our business. And I'll even add one more dimension that Ray in addition to the Europe. Ray's team is finishing a rollout of POS for a sale across North America as well as consistent ERP system across North America. It is going very well but we are confident that completion of that project will enable to unleash further synergies in our base business here in North America. We acknowledge the strong merchandize same store figures reported today. Can you provide some color on various category contributions to the growth that is fresh tobacco et cetera? And how much was driven by increased promotional spending pricing as SG&A was higher than we forecasted? This question was previously answered. Therefore we will pass to the next question. The tax rate was the highest it has ever been in some time. Should we expect this to persist or does the company have mechanism it can rely on to see the rate fall back down again? i.e. Non North American acquisition MLP structures et cetera. Also I already pretty much answer to this question, it is in line with the kind of guideline that we give the last quarters and it would be -- as I said basically pretty much the same or slightly better we will see next year. For the rest I think for now it is -- we are keeping the pace basically on what we are doing and not necessarily looking to do anything materially different than what we did over the recent years. Organic operating expenses increased by just over 2% this quarter which is a bit higher than recent quarters. Can you please discuss the cost drivers this quarter and outlook for this year? This question was also previously answered. So we are going to pass to the next question. Now that you are budgeting process for fiscal 2016 is complete. What is the reasonable CapEx level for this year? And if you could highlight any major projects that have -- that are included as part of the CapEx budget? Well, see already did cover that in a previous question. But I will say the most important element is as I mentioned basically the CapEx that will be focused on what I will call CapEx generating basically value that will represent the biggest part of the budget of this year. And as I said the acceleration of the new trend where we build a location and single store acquisition will be also a driven factor. But in the end it's all related to basically return and as you know us basically were pretty disciplined on that side than -- I think overall basically the CapEx will slightly be higher but not necessarily basically not be focused on generating value. In Europe, other operations segment, can you elaborate about the profit deterioration in the remaining business and how you see it playing out? I'd say the biggest portion of the decrease versus the previous year and the previous quarter is related to the aviation business that we did -- that we sold in December, 2014. The rest is related to the trade that we made related to B2B and the marine business or the boat business, we made a choice basically in term of balancing the volume versus the margin contribution. I'll say it is not necessarily a trend, it is a more basically a factor or fact but at the end basically the decisions that were taken, I think were the good one for the organization. On the acquisition outlook, you are seeing any change in the multinational desire to sell or keep their European retail operations? I think the answer that's really company specific depending on which multinational you are talking about. At a macro level we continue to believe that the overall trend is toward the multinationals getting out of human intensive retailing, can't predict the pace, it remains to be seen little lower pruned environment, over a sustained period of time would impact that pace or not. The first question the US fuel volumes were very high. What is driving fuel volumes right now and do you think it is sustainable? Can you update us on two merchandize categories in the United States? The current state of tobacco and your progress in fresh food. As we said this question was also previously answered. Therefore we will pass to the next set of questions. The next analyst Vishal Shreedhar from the National Bank Financial has no question at this time. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our webcast presentation for today.
