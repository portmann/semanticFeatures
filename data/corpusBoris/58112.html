The Myth Of The U.K.'s Fiscal Austerity | Seeking Alpha The U.K. claims to be following a policy of fiscal austerity. But in reality its policy is anything but austere. Its success is educational. U.K. government spending has been rising, unlike Greece or others that are truly on austerity. The U.K. and U.S. are indeed the strongest-performing economies, but both do not follow austere fiscal policy. Niall Ferguson wrote May 11 in the Financial Times that fiscal austerity in the UK worked beautifully. He wrote: The UK had the best performing of the G7 economies last year, with a real gross domestic product growth rate of 2.6 per cent. In 2009, the last full year of Labour government, the figure was minus 4.3 per cent. Moreover, far from being in depression, the UK economy has generated more than 1.9m jobs since May 2010. UK unemployment is now 5.6 per cent, roughly half the rates in Italy and France. Weekly earnings are up by more than 8 per cent; in the private sector, the figure is above 10 per cent. Inflation is below 2 per cent and falling. He attributed this success to Chancellor Osborne. However, as a point of fact, Osborne's austerity was just a play with words. To wit, UK government spending has never fallen nominally. It has actually steadily risen, from 674,479 million pounds in 2009-10 to 722,897 million pounds in 2013-14. This is quite unlike the genuine kind of austerity recommended for Greece or Spain, where there were massive layoffs as a result of actual cuts in government spending. The UK even introduced a generous Help to Buy Scheme to stimulate the housing market. If anything, the success of the UK and the US in weathering the global financial tsunami lies in the absence of genuine fiscal austerity. Osborne did talk a lot about austerity, but he acted otherwise. With mild increases in government spending, and with the remarkable weakness in the pound sterling until quite recently, which was possible thanks to the UK not being a member of the Eurozone, the success was achieved. Ferguson mocked Krugman also in the belief that Osborne's policy was one of austerity. The record needs to be put straight. The European version of austerity, which was the genuine kind, did not work. Its unemployment, at over 11%, is higher than it was in 2009-10. The record should be put straight.
