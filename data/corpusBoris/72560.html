What Is Weighing On The U.S. Dollar? | Seeking Alpha The U.S. economy contracted in the first quarter. Moreover, business investment and consumer spending slowed. The U.S. dollar is weakening as slowing economic growth weighs on government bond yields. The U.S. currency is represented by PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bullish (NYSEARCA: UUP ). In the first quarter, the economic growth figure came in at a quarterly pace of -0.7% contraction, down from the previous quarter's reading of 2.2%, while also missing estimates for 0.2%. Over the past two years, the first quarter has resulted in economic contraction, seen below. Falling consumer spending and business investment have been blamed for the recent slowdown. "The downturn primarily reflected a deceleration in PCE and downturns in exports, in nonresidential fixed investment, and in state and local government spending that were partly offset by a deceleration in imports and upturns in federal government spending and in private inventory investment," according to Trading Economics. Moreover, business investment has remained weak the past few quarters as lower oil prices weighed on spending in the energy sector. In the first quarter, the business investment figure came in at a quarterly pace of -0.71% contraction, below the previous quarter's reading of 1.16%. Business investment has been pretty flat the past few years, seen below. Spending on physical structures contracted the most, a representation of the slowdown in the energy sector. "Nonresidential fixed investment fell -2.8% in the first quarter of 2015, the sharpest decline since the final months of 2009. Spending on structures contracted -20.8%, likely a reflection of cheaper oil prices forcing oil and gas companies to slash investments in wells and related facilities," according to the Wall Street Journal. Finally, as the economy weakened, yields fell on government bonds. U.S. 10-year bond yields fell to 2.09%, down from highs exceeding 2.2% in weeks earlier. The weakening economic climate signaled to investors that the Federal Reserve may push back the date of increasing the lending rate until late 2015. "The data supported an expectation that the Fed would have to consider signs of weakness in the U.S. economy before raising interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade," according to CNBC. Weak economic data are weighing on the minds of policymakers. Slowing economic growth was caused mostly by weakening consumer spending and business investment. Additionally, as the economy slowed, interest rates fell as investors are pricing in a later start to increased lending rates. The longer lending rates remain low, the more selling pressure will overtake the U.S. dollar, which could be the case in coming months. Source: What Is Weighing On The U.S. Dollar?
