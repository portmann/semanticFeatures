‘Snowzilla’ Blizzard Was No Monster for the Economy - Real Time Economics - WSJ The U.S. Capitol rises above a mound of snowÂ Monday.Â Lost work hours and compensation for federal employeesÂ took a toll on the government.Â But restaurants likely took the biggest economic hit. The big snowstorm that socked the East Coast , shut down schools, the government and some businesses and disrupted the daily routine for millions will have only a small impact on the U.S. economy. Moody’s Analytics’ economists Ryan Sweet and Adam Kamins estimate the economic cost of the snowstorm at about $2.5 billion to $3 billion. That counts output that was lost and wonâ€™t be recouped through overtime, working from home and deferred spending. It doesn’t include possible costs from infrastructure damage. Put into context, $2.5 billion to $3 billion may as well be a snowflake in a blizzard. Americans spent $54.5 billion at restaurants and bars just in December. Total U.S. economic output in 2014â€”the most recent full year availableâ€”was more than $17 trillion. The storm put a mere 0.02% dent in the economy. So while in past years,Â  extreme weather has taken a bigger chunk out of U.S. growth ,Â this time there shouldn’t be a noticeable effect. That was pretty much expected . That doesn’t mean some businesses and workers won’t feel a squeeze. While the storm likely postponed consumer spending or shifted it from brick-and-mortar stores to online–rather than canceling it outright–much restaurant traffic was likely lost for good. Messrs. Sweet and Kamins said restaurants, counted as part of retail trade, will be the blizzard’s “big losers.” Closures on Friday and Monday, normally work days, added to the cost. For example, while federal government spending will simply be postponed, government output will still take a hit from lost work hours and compensation for federal employees. “Unlike government spending on goods and services, all the loss in hours worked will not be made up in subsequent weeks,” the Moody’s economists said. Transit systems that shut down–by Monday, Washington’s Metro was partly open but not charging fares–also lost revenue that won’t be recouped. Some airports and ports also felt the chill. Of course, the storm’s timing certainly helped. Most people don’t work and many offices close on the weekend.
