The Malaise Of All Economic Theories | Seeking Alpha Neither Keynesian nor monetary economics have produced a solution to ailing developed economies. Austrian economics is not used by any government as the basis for decision making. There is much ringing of hands about the state of the developed world economies. Monetary policy has not produced strong growth and many articles are now suggesting faith is dwindling in Central bank policies. Here is a link to a typical article produced by Peter Tenebrarum on Seeking Alpha. At the same time Keynesian theories are being tested. Large budget deficits used by many governments in the period after the financial crisis of 2008 have failed to produce that ever elusive 'escape velocity' for any developed economy. The reaction has been to abandon large fiscal deficits. This decision (amongst other government failures) has recently been criticized by Ben Bernanke as the reason for the failure of the US economy to reach the much fabled 'escape velocity'. Apparently the present malaise was not his fault, but due to not getting sufficient help from government ( link ). Paul Krugman has argued incessantly that US fiscal policy is too restrictive. Economic arguments are starting to move in the direction of ' people's QE '. This term is a neat salesman's trick to sell government deficits financed by money printing from Central banks. As this policy is largely untested it is difficult to predict it's results. It is likely that in it's initial stage it will produce robust growth. But like QE, it's size will need to be greater and greater to produce an expanding economy in successive economic cycles. If, as seems likely, it is the chosen medicine for our economies, we will test the last Keynesian hope for success. If it fails (and in the long term it will fail) we will have to abandon monetarism and Keynesian policies. It is just possible that reasonable men prevail and we do not go down the people's QE route. The signs are not good though as central bank monetary policy now views QE as normal. We are slowly but surely encompassing policies that would once have been seen as irresponsible. However if we do not go down this path, we still need to find a policy framework that is successful. I am presently reading 'Money, bank credit and economic cycles' by Jesus De Soto. It is an interesting read by an Austrian economist but it seems to me to leave out some very important behavioral analysis: All economic theories treat sovereign nations the same. The same policies will apparently work in Japan, the US or China. To argue that Countries will all react the same to any given prescription is just ludicrous. Economies have different histories and laws. People, on masse, will not act the same with different backgrounds and restrictions. The impact of new technology on the way we act financially. With internet sales, mobile banking and robotics in industry, we cannot be making the same financial decisions that we made 50 or 100 years ago. The importance of debt levels to economics. Apparently debt is not part of any Fed model (and we wonder why their forecasting record is so bad). How will higher levels of debt effect our behavior in the future. This important fact seems to be largely ignored. Keynes died in 1946, Friedman in 2006, Von Mises in 1973 and Hayek in 1992. Does our present day society resemble any of those dates. I would argue not. It seems likely that we will test the final limits of Monetary and Keynesian policy before abandoning it. I do not believe that either will provide the results that we are seeking. The behavioral basis of Austrian economics is not used anywhere in the developed world. In it's present form, it seems to me to fall short of a theory that will persuade policy makers that it should become their policy of choice. It is the theory that will most likely provide ultimate success, but is presently not fit for purpose (in my opinion). It would seem that we are going to try every short term policy that Keynes and Freidman have suggested, with the usual twist from governments that leave out all the stuff that is unpopular. Once this process is done, we might then move to a different solution. My hope is that whilst we live through the Keynesian and monetary nightmare, behavioral economics (either Austrian or otherwise) starts to produce an up to date policy that is fit for purpose. If it does not, we will truly leave our children in a mess. To finish, a little light entertainment. Here is an article from Frances Coppola that is priceless - and to think economists have been worrying about a problem with such a simple solution!
