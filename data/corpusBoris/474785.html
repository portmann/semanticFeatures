U.S. factory activity dips; construction spending weak | Reuters U.S. factory activity dips; construction spending weak WASHINGTON U.S. manufacturing activity slowed in July as orders fell broadly, while a drop in construction spending in June  suggested a downward revision to the second-quarter economic growth estimate published last week. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity slipped 0.6 percentage pointÂ to a reading of 52.6 last month. A reading above 50 indicates an expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy. Manufacturing remains constrained by the lagging effects of the dollar's rally and an oil price plunge between June 2014 and December 2015, which have hurt exports and undercut business spending. Although the ISM index has remained above expansion territory for five consecutive months, so-called hard data on manufacturing has been generally weak amid soft business spending. Last month, manufacturers reported declines in new orders, export orders and order backlogs. Factory employment also fell, though production increased. Prices of U.S. Treasuries pared losses after the data, while the dollar .DXY was stronger against a basket of currencies. U.S. stocks were trading higher. In a separate report, the Commerce Department said construction spending declined 0.6 percent to its lowest level since June 2015 after dipping 0.1 percent May. June marked the third straight month of declines in outlays. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending rising 0.5 percent in June after a previously reported0.8 percent drop in May. Their June estimates were largely based on the government's assumptions for private residential and nonresidential construction spending in the advance GDP report. The government reported on Friday that gross domestic product increased at a 1.2 percent annual rate in the second quarter after rising at a 0.8 percent pace in the January-March period. Weak spending on home building and nonresidential structures, including gas and oil well drilling, contributed to anemic growth in the last quarter. In June, construction spending was held down by a 0.6percent drop in private construction. Outlays on private residential construction were unchanged as spending on both single-family and multi-family projects fell. Private residential construction spending edged up 0.1 percent in May. Spending on renovations increased in June. Spending on private nonresidential structures fell 1.3 percent in June, the biggest decline since December 2015, after rising 0.4 percent in May. Public construction spending slipped 0.6 percent in June, dropping for a fourth straight month. Outlays on state and local government construction projects, the largest portion of the public sector segment, fell 0.5 percent. That was the fourth consecutive monthly decline. Federal government construction spending dropped 2.3 percent in June. Reuters News Agency | Brand Attribution Guidelines | Delivery Options Reuters is the news and media division of Thomson Reuters .
