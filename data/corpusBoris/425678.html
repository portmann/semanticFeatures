Fiscal 2016 was a transition year in which we faced many challenges and delivered what I would consider mixed results. I’m very proud of our people and the hard work they have put into our transition, and I'm very appreciative of the support that we’ve received from our customers. While we’ve made some excellent progress in certain respects, overall we are not satisfied with our performance. It’s evident that the transition we began back in FY 2015 is taking longer than we anticipated, particularly with regards to our effort to grow our ASR bookings in order to meet our objective for subscription revenue. On the positive side, we’ve improved our margins to 59% this year from 43% last year. Most of that was driven by our transition out of the services business and the healthcare application market. In addition, our team has also made significant improvement in our operating cost. Therefore, despite our revenue performance, our subscription revenue margins were in-line with our expectation. In FY 2016, our total expense structure improved by nearly $20 million year-over-year. The bottom line, we continue to manage our cash very well during this transition. Also during fiscal 2016, we made some impressive improvement to our base platform. In June, we released about 120 APIs, which has opened up the platform for use of our customers and partners. This release was part of an FY 2016 roadmap planned for later in the year, but due to some tremendous effort by our team, we've enabled a release earlier. In October of last year, we made an industry leading announcement with the release of our Internet of Things Ecosystem. This is a substantial improvement to our base platform and further positions Covisint at the forefront of securely connecting devices to our platform. This IOT Ecosystem makes this concept of IOT actually something that is truly implemental by our business partners and our customers. So, I believe our product is strong and it will get even stronger in FY 2017. Having said all of that, our subscription revenue and ASR bookings were below our expectations. On the subscription revenue side of the business, we achieved $17.2 million in the fourth quarter, which brings our FY 2016 total subscription revenue to $63.4 million, a decline of 4% year-over-year. We finished with ASR bookings of $9.3 million for FY 2016. While we had some significant successes in our automotive accounts, our bookings from our direct sales force overall as well as from our strategic partners was disappointing. We simply did not deliver on these fronts. As a result, we are making important and focused changes to our direct sales strategy, intended to increase our resources and our focus on the automotive market, where we have been historically strong. Let me transition and talk a bit about FY 2017 in more detail to discuss our strategy and plans as we move forward. Needless to say our [indiscernible] focus for FY 2017 will be sales along with some continued strong expense management. First, let me spend some time talking about our sales organization and the changes we are making there. Let me start with our strategic partner, and say I’m satisfied with the leadership and the sales organization that we have put in place last year. We will continue our focus on strategic partners in FY 2017. Our strategy here has undergone a significant transformation in the last 4 to 5 months. As we have discussed over the past 18 months, we’d great mutual success with our partner Cisco and we were very focused on expansion with them. Unfortunately with all the reorganization there Cisco and us have not been able to move this partnership towards, like we both expected we would have by now. We still have a strong partnership there and we believe it will accelerate and get back on track in the near future once their organization announcements settle in. However, we also recognize at the end of last year that we needed to augment our strategy with the development of additional partnerships on a more rapid timeline. To that end, we've augmented what was a very small team with some outstanding new personnel and we've developed a new methodology to speed up the acquisition of these new partners. The plan we put in place also helps our partners themselves to accelerate their time to revenue using our platform. The strategy entails developing unique product plan and go-to market strategies with each partner to identify what could be very large revenue streams for these new partners. The potential partners that we’re talking about are very large organization, like Cisco. So you can imagine that this will take a little time. We've been very pleased with our early results here, and we have several large opportunities that we believe will be beneficial to our plans by the end of our fiscal second quarter. Strategic partners are the key area for a company of our size and we look forward to some exciting announcements here soon. One example that we’ll be talking about in the near future is the recently signed memorandum of understanding with our partner Tech Mahindra and Motwane [ph] an Indian electronics manufacturer. We've joined an MOU to pursue smart lighting opportunities together as part of the Smart Cities initiatives in Digital India, a very central point for the growth and success of India as a country, as they move forward. This is exactly the kind of IOT partnership that we’re all excited about here. Now, as for our direct sales force, our direct sales organization is undergoing some significant changes for FY 2017 and beyond. We are shifting people and spend from our general territory sales rep model to larger teams more focused on the automotive and automotive related sector, especially in the United States and in Europe. This sector is where our company began and where we have had historically great success. I would point to some significant examples last year with our success with GM OnStar and JLR dealer systems. This new organization will be headed by Detroit-based Senior Vice President who will report directly to me. I've had a search underway and I expect to fill this position in the next month or so. As you recall, we hired an MD for Europe last year. He is in place and is building a team to pursue the European Auto and auto related market. Along with this, we have organized our sales engineering and solution architect activities and organize what we call pursuit teams to be led by industry experience solution selling account execs. All with a clear focus to align ourselves within our automotive vertical wheelhouse. To implement this structure we are not only investing in new account executives, but we’re also investing in additional sales engineers and solutions architect. As we said in the past, we believe there is a wide range of opportunities within this vertical that launched our company 16 years ago. Now these pursuit teams will focus primarily on six specific use cases where we’ve had success in the past, we have good experience, we've been very successful to date, with our five major auto accounts you all know today comprise 40% of our subscription revenue. We've had a terrific success in renewing contracts, many of them at a favorable economics and adding new use cases with an existing customer that previously had one or two cases. So the objective here is to expand the use cases in those accounts and to leverage our success there into other accounts. For the sake of clarity, let me spend some time to elaborate on a few of these used cases. First, connected vehicle, it’s a classic IOT used case. And you know we already have two of the largest and most successful IOT implementations in the world with our partnership at GM OnStar and at Hyundai. Supply chain, that’s where our Covisint cut its piece 16 years ago. The AR Covisint Cloud platform supports General Motors, Ford, Daimler, and JLR with more than 95,000 suppliers greater than 500,000 users and hundreds of millions of transactions annually. Consumer experience, this is an up-and-coming IOT used case. Every major auto manufacturer is today investing in ride sharing and car sharing programs, as well as working to improve the consumer experience from the web to dealer engagement. Finally, dealer intelligence system is an important part of our relationship with Ford and JLR and where we today have some significant new proposals in process. So mathematically, these five customers have an addressable opportunity of some 30 used cases and we have eight used cases already. So, our near-term objective will be to examine the other 22 opportunities. Our target for FY 2017 will be to book a small handful of these other 22 opportunities to meet our ASR and bookings objectives. Needless to say, and addition to examining the used cases with the five major auto customers we have, we’re also engaging with the four other major auto manufacturers that we currently don't have as customers, which realistically provide opportunities for us in the future. I should point out that we will also retain a small direct sales force, much reduced from what it was last year. This sales force is in place to both support our important non-auto customers and to pursue some new auto-related and manufacturing opportunity. In FY 2016, our marketing team has made great strides in improving our standing and recognition with key technology analyst. We are increasingly highlighted as one of the key players solving the complex challenges of identity for IOT, an area of growing importance. At the same time we are well recognized for our vision and capabilities, and Cloud identity, and access management. During the fiscal fourth quarter of last year, we launched this similar effort to re-establish relationships with auto industry analysts. And we’re already seeing early signs of success having begun acknowledge recently and pieces by Gartner, Foster and ABI Research for our role in connected vehicle. In FY 2017, we will further invest in developing relationships with these and other auto industry analysts. We’ve also expanded our marketing efforts on developer enablement and evangelism. But the rapidly expanding set of Cloud platform options is critically important that we attract site and enable developers to build solutions on our platform beyond what our strategic partners are doing. We will provide updates on this initiative as the year progresses. So, we’ll continue to invest in marketing in FY 2017, but specifically to improve our brand recognition in the market, especially for our ability to accelerate the future of various light connected vehicles, consumer experience, and dealer intelligence, as well as our technology leadership in cloud identity and access management and the Internet of Things. Putting in all together, considering our results from FY 2017, we expect year-over-year subscription revenue for FY 2017 to be flat versus fiscal 2016. We expect to finish FY 2017 with $30 million. Enrico is going to discuss our outlook in greater detail. As I conclude, I want to emphasize the commitment we have and we have made to complete the transition we began two years ago. That’s to deliver subscription revenue growth. We see that large organizations are beginning to see the benefit of transforming the business in this digital economy and there is no place where this is more evident than in the moves being made by the ward worldwide auto industry. The Covisint cloud platform is already installed in many of these accounts, and each day our platform is becoming more important for the strategies they are making. We are investing to expand our used cases in these accounts and to add significant new customers. At this point, I’d like to turn the call over to Enrico, who will walk you through our financial results and provide some additional commentary. Enrico? Thank you, Sam. Turning to Slide 5, the left side of this chart represents a pro forma non-GAAP financial overview for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016 in total. As a reminder to everyone, the non-GAAP presentation excludes the impact of stock options comp and treats R&D is a period expense versus a GAAP approach, which capitalizes a portion of R&D. The GAAP P&L, the non-GAAP P&L, the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP were included in the press release earlier. During the fourth quarter, we delivered total revenue of $20 million. Fourth quarter subscription revenue finished at about $17.2 million, a decrease of 6% year-over-year. We call that our fourth quarter revenue includes PQRS, which for the year was $ 2.1 million, a decline of $1.1 million versus the $ 3.2 million we had in the fourth quarter of last year. Subscription revenues in total represented 86% of our overall revenue for the quarter. And as Sam mentioned, we are a subscription revenue business and continue to focus on this element of the business going forward. Covisint's revenue declined 45% and finished at $2.8 million, which was in line with the expectations we have set. We achieved a non-GAAP gross margin of 65% in the quarter, which is a significant increase from the 47% a year ago. We are pleased with our subscription margins and our transition to services partners during the past year has enabled us to make sizable reductions in our services expense. Operating expenses were in line with our expectation. We finished the quarter with a non-GAAP $0.5 million loss versus last year where we had $2.2 million. We finished the quarter also and the year with $39.7 million of cash. For the quarter, total free cash flow burn, which is cash used in operations and investing activities was a positive $2.1 million. For the full year, we delivered revenues of $76 million. Subscription revenues were $63.4 million, a 4% decline from last year. As a reminder, our fiscal 2016 subscription revenue included about $8 million of business that we have since exited and as we’ve noted on prior calls we replaced that revenue in new and higher margin business. Accordingly, a more appropriate description will be to compare our current results against the same set of business a year ago, which would imply fiscal 2016 year-over-year underlying subscription growth of revenue of about 6% on a comparable basis. For the year, subscription revenue represented 83% of our total revenue. Services revenue declined approximately 43% and finished the year at $12.7 million, which was in-line with our guidance this time a year ago. Gross margin came in at 59%, a sizable improvement from the 43% last year. And we finished the year with a $12.9 million non-GAAP performance. For the year, total free cash flow burn, which is cash used in operating and listing activities was $11.9 million. As Sam noted, we finished the fiscal 2016 with $9.3 million of ASR bookings. As Sam noted in his remarks, we are disappointed with our performance in fiscal 2016 as we were unable to deliver upon our subscription revenue outlook from this time a year ago. Our subscription revenue was 11% below our original expectations at this meeting a year ago. These types of results in [indiscernible] and proactive management teams that operate businesses to consider immediate alternative courses of action to manage business in its entirety. In the face of our challenge and we progress through the year, we implemented swift and effective initiatives to ensure that the disappointing topline performance did not find its way to the bottom line. As a result, our free cash flow for the year, for the year actually beat by 11% the guidance that we provided a year ago at this time. The bottom right part of this slide provides our outlook and expectations for fiscal 2017. Our guidance is based on current market condition. For the full year fiscal 2017, we expect year-over-year subscription revenue to be flat, as Sam noted, versus 2016 and we expect services revenue to be between 15% to 20% of our total revenue. For Q1 fiscal 2017, we expect subscription revenue to decline - to be a decline of about 8% versus last year and services revenue to be about 15% to 20% of total revenue. With fiscal 2017 subscription becoming a larger mix of our overall revenue, we expect gross margin to be between 55% and 60%. We expect to finish fiscal 2017 with a loss between $11 million and $12 million on a non-GAAP pro forma basis of which we expect a net loss of between $4 million and $5 million in the first quarter. We expect to finish fiscal 2017 with $30 million of cash on-hand and we expect to have above $39 million at the end of first quarter. Finally, we expect our shares outstanding at the end of fiscal year to be 40.7 million. Thanks Enrico. In closing, FY 2017 continued the transition we began back in FY 2015, with mixed results. Over the past two years we have successfully transitioned to a fully independent enterprise grade software company. We have made a number of strategically significant decisions in both subscription and services business, transformed our leadership team, and are now implementing a new sales approach. Although the changes while necessary are never easy, I believe we have responsibly and prudently taken the appropriate actions. Consequently, I believe the company is well-positioned to continue its effort to become the cloud platform of choice for the Internet of Things, cloud identity, and access management, and key strategic moves with our auto customers. We are extremely committed and focused on growing sales in FY 2017 to meet the objectives we missed last year, which is to begin to show subscription revenue growth. Before I turn the call over to the operator for your questions, let me touch on two recent events of the company. First, we successfully reached settlement of the class action lawsuit relative to the IPO back in 2013. And the next step is final court approval. 95% of the settlement caused are covered by insurance, and by our prior patent, so the impact on Covisint from a financial standpoint, cash standpoint is minimal. Secondly, we received notice of nomination from a shareholder. The purpose of this call is to discuss our FY 2016 financial results and our outlook and changes we’re making for FY 2017. Accordingly, I will not comment on these developments nor answer any questions about them. We need to refer you to our public filings and other communications we've made on this subject. So with that, I’ll turn the call back over to the operator to open the lines, should you have any questions. Hi Sam, hi Enrico. Thanks for taking my question. I guess Sam just to start, relative to the performance in the fourth quarter and perhaps on overall assessment of the year, I guess how would you dimensionalize the challenges that you faced, or where the issues more related to lack of market demand, product functionality gap with the need for increase R&D competition, or is it an issue of distribution and not having the right sales strategy, just wondering how you would force rank those issues and what steps you are taking to address each of them? Hi Kyle. Thanks for calling in and your interest. It in my opinion, falls primarily on our sales and our sales execution Kyle. The market is maturing and we see the market coming to us. We've been early doing a lot of missionary work in this cloud platform market as some of our competitors have. So, I don't see a problem in the market at all. The product line in my opinion is tremendous and we made those two significant enhancements to the product. I think functionally the product is actually ahead of the market. Said differently we've not encountered any opportunity including the big upgraded OnStar where our platform cannot handle or what the customer wants us to do. So, I believe that there was some distraction also from the restructuring and the changes we've continued to make in the company, but I would not defer your comment from our lack of sales execution on the direct side. I think on the partner side, you already know that we counted quite a bit on increasing our business with Cisco last year as I talked about before and that simply didn't happen. We had a lot of eggs in that basket hence the point about the changes and the addition of the new resources and expanding our partnership strategy going into FY 2017. Does that answer your question? It does, it helps. But I guess just on the decision to double down on the auto and auto related factors, I guess is there a functionality gap that precludes you from attacking and being more successful in other verticals and used cases, considering how pervasive the identity and IoT markets are? Or is it more of a function of balance sheet and investments necessary to penetrate the other markets. Just wondering why you are limiting yourself just to autos when use cases opportunities are theoretically very large? I got you. I didn’t catch that part of your question; I got a bad phone line here. No, it is not functionality Kyle, and it is simply the fact that a company our size, if you look at how thinly we can spread the resources we can afford to your point of balance sheet that I believe last year we attacked the auto business we currently have, but it’s clear to me that we need additional resource in auto and it’s just a question of small company, how many people, how much resource do we have and how much can we afford? Given that we’ve got cash and the cash is got to be spent judiciously. Got it, it’s helpful. And I guess for Enrico, with regards to your subscription guidance for fiscal 2017, it would be really helpful if you could deconstruct the elements a little bit, in fiscal 2016 your subscription revenue grew 6%, excluding the healthcare business, you booked 9.3 million of ASR and now you are guiding for 8%, down 8% in fiscal first quarter and then flat for the year, I guess what are you anticipating in terms of retention in churn, is the guidance largely based on existing customer renewals and how much are you baking in for new sales strategy, just trying to handicap the conservatism here. Right, yes. First of all we are expecting a part of our revenue mixture to come from new bookings, which would come in the second, third, and fourth quarters. The first quarter is kind of related a bit to - compared from last year and into a degree as well. We do have some churn that’s happening in the first quarter of this year, for fiscal 2017 rather, that will affect 2017 by itself. For the most part the 6% that I referenced earlier from the growth, most of that’s behind us now. So, if we go into fiscal 2017 and we really won’t have any more exiting from the prior healthcare business application stuff that we started getting out of two years ago. Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. Enrico I actually wanted to start just kind of house cleaning question kind of, I’m not sure if you mentioned it, I didn't hear it, the PQRI number in the quarter for revenue, how much was that? Okay. So if I put in $2.1 million for the PQRI it looks like the subscription revenue was down sequentially in the quarter, I mean maybe you could just kind of speak to, it looks like roughly $200,000 from Q3, speak to, I mean did you have a - did you lose a customer in that quarter, is there something else that I’m missing as far as kind of why…? Yeah. We didn't lose, we sort of - part of the quarter, some small part of it with some of the lagging exiting from the healthcare and then just kind of little bit of timing of some third quarter activity where we did some excess extra billing for volume, where some of the customers sold - $200,000 between two quarters, for me it’s kind of flat. So, we just had a couple of minor things that went one way or the other. So your conclusion, you know after taking PQRS out, we were flat quarter-over-quarter and that is actually correct. You know, it has a lot to do with really where we are at the bookings. And as we think about fiscal 2017, PQRS, I know that's been somewhat of an unpredictable number over the years, but is that flat lining, is that down ticking, how should we think about how that business is trending? Yes, that’s a good question. And there are actually, you know some secular changes going on in the OPQRS part of the business as more of these smaller companies with which we’ve been using as customers have been - being observed by larger companies and using their ERP systems to file, so we went down from $3.2 million last year to $2.1 million this year to a rough $1.1 million and if you remember correctly from the past few years this is kind of gone up from a million-dollar number a few years back to $3 million and now we see going the other way, so next year I’m really counting on about $1.7 million in the PQRS space. So, I think it’s going to fall off even a little bit more from where it is this year. Okay, and then just kind of following up on sort of fiscal 2017 guidance, just as we think about the company reaching free cash flow breakeven you actually had a positive quarter in Q4, I wonder maybe you got to talk to us as far as what’s keeping you from reaching a more sustainable positive free cash flow at this point in time, when do you think you will reach and as we think about these shifts that are taking place in the model regarding the sales force, are there any charges that are taking place that would weigh on cash flow in fiscal 2017? Okay. So you know the, first of all we don't see fiscal - we don't see cash flow breakeven in 2017 fiscal year, which I regarded the way we did. We do have in the fourth quarter of this year we did have a fairly large annual payment that comes in, in February that is actually for the entire calendar year. So that has the impact of the $2.1 million positive cash flow that we just referenced in the quarter. And we have another, not quite as big, but we have another annual payment that comes in, in May as well or after June. That has an influence in making the first quarter look a little bit better than one quarter of the year. Great. And then just if I could follow up real quick Sam, just kind of on the fiscal partnership I know you talked about this on the last call regarding kind of how that’s not moving as fast as you want, but maybe you can kind of just give us an update as has anything changed relative to where we were a quarter ago and is there any way from a time perspective to gauge when that partnership may pick up some? Yes, it is a fair point. The last organization, well, you may have seen they had a sales - a fairly complete and expensive sales reorganization just last week. But on the product side, late last year, early this year they made their final product reorganization and our group now reports to a gentleman named Biri Singh, who runs their cloud and analytics business. So we've got a stable product organization. We have a bit of an unstable sales organization now and this has moved around. And the sales organization that was selling this with the direct sales force has been moved over to the services organization. I do not know the exact executive there. I need to go get that done. So, but said differently I guess, I think we’re going to give this another quarter or so to see if we could get this sorted out with the organization at Cisco. The VP are the same, but we've got new executive leadership almost every time we turn around. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. At this time I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Inman for any closing remarks. Again folks I want to thank you all for taking time and your day to join us and we appreciate your interest in the company and the questions. I repeat that we have a transition underway here. The management team and all of the employees remain committed to finishing this transition. We've made good progress on many of the important elements we have in this company, but we have got to give focus on our sales, our bookings, and our sales, that will be a big focus for us next year. Look forward to talking to you after the close of the first quarter. We will give you better guidance for the rest of the year. Thank you. Thank you.
