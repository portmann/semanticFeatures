Assessing the Counter-cyclical Macro Policies of the Great Recession | Econbrowser [T]he government taxes or borrows the resources used to build infrastructure projects. Government spending crowds resources out from the rest of the economy. More federal spending comes at the expense of a smaller private sector. These factors explain why the 2009 stimulus failed. So did Japanâ€™s decade-long attempt to stimulate its economy through infrastructure projects. The Japanese wound up with massive debt, superhighways in underpopulated rural districtsâ€”and an anemic economy. As far as I know, this 2014 statement from the Heritage Foundation is not based on a given econometric study, but is an article of faith, much like the assertion of “The Treasury View” discussed in this post . Or, one can appeal to extant estimates of multipliers to estimate how the economy would have performed in the absence of fiscal and monetary stimulus and financial system rescuses. That is exactly what is done in a Blinder-Zandi CBPP study , with the results shown in Figure 1. Figure 1: Actual GDP (black), counterfactual GDP under no economic response (blue), counterfactual GDP under no fiscal response (red), potential GDP (gray bold), all in billions Ch.2009$, SAAR; log scale. Source: Blinder and Zandi (2015) , appendix tables B1, B2; and CBO, Budget and Economic Outlook (August 2015), via FRED. The fiscal policies include not just the ARRA (discussed here and here ) but also the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008, implemented under G.W. Bush, extended unemployment insurance benefits, and payroll tax relief. Of the total 1,484 billion outlays, slightly under half took the form of tax cuts ($701 billion) and slightly over half in spending ($783 billion). I think you are going down a rathole of correlations (which are usuaully based on limited data sets and subject to cherry picking [an extreme would be your citing little snippets about the Republican administration in Wisconsin being there for a decrease in population, not considering Texas for instance as a counterpoint], when more intuitive insights from markets [like the mantra] would serve you better. I prescribe reading Free to Choose by Milton Friedman and watching the TV series. Countries and leaders alike need to encourage the masses to invest there money instead of spending on trending consumer behavior patterns ( ex holiday spending). No doubt spending is good for the economy, however regular people through proper investing could form what you call a contingency reserve where they can have some cash to pad a crisis, thus spending normally through financial meltdowns. Sort of like the squirrel that instead of stashing a ton of nuts, planted them all around the nest so there will never be another shortage again.
