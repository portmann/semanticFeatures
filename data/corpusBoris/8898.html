Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Our fourth quarter capped a successful fiscal year for Tech Data, a year in which we achieved profitable revenue growth and improved earnings while also making considerable progress on a number of operational fronts. Our focus on the market and operations throughout the fiscal year produced good leverage delivering double-digit growth in annual non-GAAP operating income, net income, and earnings per share on low-single-digit net sales growth. In addition, we earned a return on invested capital of 11%, more than 200 basis points above our weighted average cost of capital, and we recently completed the $100 million share repurchase authorization announced in December bringing our cumulative repurchases to $1.2 billion since 2006, or nearly 44% of total shares issued. We entered fiscal year 2015 anticipating non-GAAP earnings growth in the second half of the year, particularly in Q4. However, as the year progressed, a robust IT market combined with our strong execution resulted in higher earnings growth than expected through the first nine months of the year. This performance allowed us to selectively grow our business during the fourth quarter consciously pulling back on certain high-volume, low-margin business. Excluding the impact of currency, our European region sales came in on plan growing by low-single digits in constant currency and delivering improved non-GAAP operating income margin and the highest non-GAAP operating income in euros in the region's history. In the Americas, this exchange of lower margin revenue was most noticeable in Q4. Our conscious effort on pricing ourselves out of certain business combined with the slowdown in demand for key products in the second half of the quarter caused sales in the U.S. to come in below our expectations. Despite the region's top-line shortfall to plan in Q4, our emphasis on quality revenue, together with good expense management produced the Americas region's highest operating income dollars and margin in 10 quarters. While the timing of the fiscal year's earnings growth developed differently than we originally anticipated, with most of the earnings growth in the first half, our fiscal year 2015 operating performance on a worldwide basis came in above plan, primarily due to strong European results. In addition to delivering solid financial results for the fiscal year, we've also taken proactive steps to further strengthen and better position the company for the future. We continue to apply and align resources to more profitable, high-return markets and areas of business. To this end, yesterday we announced our exit from Chile, Peru, and Uruguay. Over the 16-year period of operating in each of these countries, we did not achieve the scale required to consistently generate acceptable levels of profit and return on invested capital. Exiting these small country operations will allow us to focus on and expand our Latin America export business in Miami and our operations Mexico, both of which are larger, faster-growing, and more developed IT opportunities. Our actions at improved fiscal 2015 financial results clearly show that our diversified customer and product portfolio combined with our disciplined focus on profitable growth enabled Tech Data to deliver strong results for its shareholders and position the company for continued earnings growth and shareholder value creation in fiscal 2016 and beyond. I'll now turn the call over to Jeff, who will provide an overview of our operational results and our outlook for Q1. I'll close with an update on the business and then we'll open the call up for your questions. Jeff? Jeffery P. Howells - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Director Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Many of my comments this morning will reference to supplemental schedules available on our website. Beginning with the fourth slide, fourth quarter worldwide net sales declined 8% to $7.3 billion. Excluding the negative impact of the weakening of certain foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar, net sales were essentially flat year-over-year. For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, our worldwide net sales increased 3% to $27.7 billion. Excluding the negative impact of weakening of certain foreign currencies against U.S. dollars, net sales increased approximately 5% over the previous fiscal year. Now turning to our sales by region, beginning with the fifth slide. The Americas fourth quarter net sales decreased 5% to $2.6 billion. As Bob indicated earlier, lower net sales in the Americas was primarily due to our decision to price ourselves out of certain business that we believe did not have the right returns. At a country level, Canada delivered good growth, and in the U.S., the education, federal and healthcare vertical sectors, all posted strong double-digit growth. At a product level, we experienced continued strength in notebook sales and strong growth in storage products. For fiscal 2015, the Americas' net sales grew 2% to $10.4 billion. Turning now to Europe on slides 6 and 7, our European region's fourth quarter net sales were $4.8 billion, a decrease of 9% in U.S. dollars or an increase of 1% in euros. At a country level, Iberia and Italy posted double-digit sales growth, and France experienced solid year-over-year growth. At a product level, Europe sales growth was fueled by continued strong demand for PCs and mobile products, and improved demand for data center products, including good growth in networking. For fiscal 2015, our European region's sales grew 4% to a record $17.3 billion, an increase of 6% in euros. Now, turning to gross profit and margin performance on the eighth slide. Worldwide gross profit dollars declined approximately 6% to $372.3 million in Q4, primarily due to the weakening of certain foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar compared to the prior-year quarter. Worldwide gross margin percentage during the fourth quarter increased 8 basis points to 5.07% compared to 4.99% in the prior-year quarter as the company continued to focus on profitable business. For the fiscal year, worldwide gross profit dollars improved 2% or approximately $1.4 billion, and gross margin percentage was 5.04% compared to 5.08% in the prior fiscal year. Turning to slide 9 for a review of our SG&A expense; non-GAAP SG&A expenses for Q4, which exclude acquisition-related intangible amortization of $6.4 million, were $260.5 million or 3.55% of net sales compared to $280.7 million or 3.52% of net sales in the prior year quarter. The decrease in non-GAAP SG&A expenses in the prior year is due to the weakening of certain foreign currencies against U.S. dollar and good expense management in both regions. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses for fiscal 2015, which exclude acquisition-related intangible amortization of $28.3 million or $1.1 billion or 3.92% of net sales compared to $1.1 billion or 4.05% of net sales in the prior year period. As a percent of sales, year-over-year improvement of 13 basis points is attributable to good cost management and operating leverage resulting in higher sales for the fiscal year. Slides 10 to 12 summarize our worldwide and regional operating income for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year. Worldwide non-GAAP operating income dollars in Q4 decreased 5% to $111.7 million. The year-over-year decline non-GAAP operating income is attributable to the weakening of certain foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar. Non-GAAP operating income margin expanded 5 basis points to 1.52% of net sales compared to 1.4% of net sales in the prior year quarter. For the fiscal year, worldwide non-GAAP operating income dollars grew 12% to $308 million or 1.1% of net sales compared to 1.03% of net sales in the prior fiscal year. On a regional basis beginning with slide 11, the Americas Q4 non-GAAP operating income grew 8% to $39.3 million. Operating margin expanded 18 basis points to 1.53% of net sales compared to 1.35% of net sales in the prior year quarter. For the fiscal year, non-GAAP operating income in the Americas grew 9% to $146 million and expanded 8 basis points to 1.4% of net sales. The improvement in both operating income dollars and margin percentage in Q4 in the fiscal year is attributable to the region's disciplined approach to the market and its ongoing focus on profitable business. Europe's non-GAAP operating income dollars in Q4 declined 8% to $76.4 million. Year-over-year decrease in non-GAAP operating income is due to the weakening of certain foreign currencies against U.S. dollars. In euros, Europe's operating income grew 4% compared to the prior year. The region's operating income expanded to 1.6% of net sales compared to 1.5% of net sales in the prior-year fourth quarter. For the fiscal year, non-GAAP operating income in the European region grew 17% to $175.6 million, as a percentage of net sales expanded by 12 basis points to 1.02%. Our interest expense was $5.9 million compared to $7.2 million in the prior-year quarter. For the fiscal year, interest expense was $26.5 million and was essentially flat compared to $26.6 million in the prior fiscal year. Excluding our non-GAAP adjustments, our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 28.5% compared to 28.7% in the prior-year quarter. For the fiscal year, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 31.8% compared to 31.5% in the prior period. As we've noted previously, quarterly effective tax rate may vary significantly depending on the actual and forecasted operating results in our various tax jurisdictions. Turning to net income and EPS on slide 13, non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 was $74.9 million compared to $80.4 million in the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $1.96 compared to $2.10 in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year decline in Q4 non-GAAP net income and earnings per share was attributable to the weakening of certain foreign currencies against U.S. dollar. We estimate the year-over-year change in currency and an impact to Q4 non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $0.17. For fiscal 2015, non-GAAP net income grew 10% to $190.8 million, non-GAAP earnings per share also increased 10% to $4.97. Turning now to some balance sheet and other highlights starting on slide 14, our cash conversion cycle in Q4 was 20 days compared to 19 days in the prior fiscal year. Net cash provided by operations in Q4 was approximately $177 million and for fiscal year 2005 (sic) [2015], we generated approximately $119 million of cash from operations. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $543 million. Our total debt balance at the end of Q4 was $366 million, and we ended the quarter with a total debt to cap ratio of 16%. We had funds available for use under our credit facilities of approximately $980 million at the end of Q4. On slide 14, we have summarized our share repurchase activity to date. During Q4, the company purchased approximately 897,000 shares of its common stock at an average cost of $59.10 per share. The company has purchased approximately 802,000 shares at an average of – has since purchased approximately 802,000 shares at an average cost of $58.62 per share. This completes the $100 million share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in December of 2014 and brings our cumulative purchases since fiscal 2006 to $1.2 billion or 28.4 million shares at an average cost $42.31 per share. Accumulated other comprehensive income, which consists of currency translation net of applicable taxes was $51 million at the end of the quarter. At January 31, 2015, the company had approximately $1.96 billion of equity, and 37.4 million shares outstanding, resulting in a book value of $52.44 per share. We had $318 million of goodwill and acquired intangibles, resulting intangible book value of approximately $43.93 per share. Capital expenditures were $9 million in Q4 and $28.1 million for the fiscal year. For fiscal 2016, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $43 million. Depreciation and amortization expense for the fourth quarter was $16.1 million and for the fiscal year it was $68.7 million. We earned a return on invested capital on a non-GAAP basis for the trailing 12-month period of 11%, versus our benchmark of 10%, and our actual cost of capital which is estimated to be approximately 8.9%. Now, looking at our customer product mix for the 12 months ended January 31 on slide 18. We estimate our breakdown of customer segments as a percentage of net sales to be VARs, 45%; direct marketers and retailers, 30%; and corporate resellers, 25%. In terms of product mix, we estimate broadline products represent 47% of our net sales; data center products, 22%; software, 18%; mobility, 10%; and consumer electronics, 3%. For the fourth quarter, two vendors represented more than 10% of our net sales, with Apple representing approximately 20% and HP approximately 17% of net sales in Q4. For fiscal year 2015, two vendors represented more than 10% of our net sales, HP representing 19% and Apple approximately 15% of net sales. Now, turning to our business outlook. As we look ahead, we are cautiously optimistic a good demand for IT products will continue in fiscal 2016, although the product mix may shift as the PC refresh in both regions, as well as the addition of the iPhone in Europe have now annualized. As we indicated last year, we anticipate higher operating leverage in the second half of the fiscal year due to the size of our European operations, and the quarterly revenue of our company being highly correlated with the European seasonality. We anticipate that this will result in significantly greater leverage in earnings power on a non-GAAP basis in the second half of our fiscal year versus the first half, particularly in the fourth quarter. For the first quarter ending April 30, 2015, the company expects low single digit year-over-year sales declines in both regions in local currencies. This outlook takes into account the loss of approximately $75 million of net sales due to the company's exit from Chile, Peru and Uruguay. We estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 33% to 35% and the average U.S. dollar to euro exchange rate to be $1.05 to €1. I'll now turn the call back over to Bob, for additional comments. Robert M. Dutkowsky - Chief Executive Officer & Director Thanks, Jeff. As we enter fiscal 2016, we will continue to leverage our capabilities and investments as well as expand our relationships with key vendors to capture profitable growth opportunities. Let me provide you with some example of these investments and the opportunities ahead in some of our strategic focus areas. Historically, much of our value proposition has revolved around activities related to the distribution of physical products. However, with the advent of the cloud and always on, always connected technology, in the last few years, we've transformed our value proposition and realigned our organization to ensure that both our vendor partners and our customers are prepared to efficiently and effectively seize the many opportunities presented in and as a service cloud environment. And that's the beauty of our model. That no matter how technology evolves, our diversification, our systems and tools, and our vendor relationships allow us to respond to the demand. An example of this transformation in process is Tech Data Europe's recent appointment to Microsoft's Cloud Solution Provider program. Building on the successful launch of the Microsoft Cloud Services Provider program in the U.S. and Canada in the last six months, Tech Data Europe's appointment as a two-tiered cloud solution provider now completes the portfolio of Microsoft Cloud products we offer to the channel in both of our regions. This program, supported by our StreamOne platform, will enhance our already robust Microsoft Cloud Solution business and firmly solidify our position as Europe's leading distributor of Office 365 and Azure. As converged infrastructure finds its optimal place in the data center ecosystem, we continue to make investments to better serve our vendor and reseller partners. An example, during Q4, we expanded our relationship with EMC in North America and Europe through a strategic agreement to offer the EMC VSPEX BLUE appliance. The hyper-converged infrastructure systems and platforms market is one of the fastest-growing and most exciting segments in the enterprise computing space, and we're honored to be the only broadline distributor selected by EMC to offer this product line. Our expanded relationship with these and many other best-in-class vendors underscores both the value we bring to the channel and our commitment to providing the most comprehensive cloud and data center offerings in the IT channel. In our Americas region, to provide a renewed focus on growth, we've recently made a number of executive appointments and restructured our go-to-market strategies within our U.S. Sales, Mobility Retail and Supply Chain Services divisions. Today, we announced the promotion of Marty Bauerlein to Senior Vice President of U.S. Sales. Marty joined Tech Data in 2004 and has served as Vice President of VAR Sales for our U.S operations since 2010. His scales of building a high-performing sales culture and forming deep-trusted relationships with our customers make him perfectly suited for this role. We are fortunate to have an executive with this extensive skill set, and we're confident he can take our U.S. Sales organization to the next level. We also recently introduced the new U.S. Mobility Solutions & Retail division led by Patrick Stokes. This division, which reports directly to Joe Quaglia, President of the Americas, will allow us to better serve our vendor partners, solution providers and retail customers, while accelerating our growth in these strategic areas of our business. During the quarter, we signed an exclusive distribution agreement with Microsoft to offer select mobile device accessories to national retailers and solution providers in the United States. With this agreement, we now offer Microsoft accessories to national retailers and solution providers in the U.S. and throughout Europe. The agreement highlights our ability to successfully leverage our core strengths to diversify our business while strengthening our value proposition with traditional IT vendor partners. We also recently announced the promotion of Shaun Sinden to Vice President and General Manager of our Americas Integrated Supply Chain Services business. Shaun and his ISCS team, who now also report directly to Joe Quaglia, will be dedicated to expanding our supply chain initiatives and portfolio of services. Our investment in this business unit delivered strong results in fiscal 2015, entering into 26 unique services agreement across an ever-expanding portfolio of diverse, built-for-purpose supply chain solutions. Our largest partners within our Supply Chain Services offering continue to expand their business with us, adding a wide array of services as well as new programs. With capabilities that range from basic transport of goods to more complex back-office operations, we are able to offer our strategic vendor partners a lower cost to serve with improved service levels. As a result of the momentum we have created, we expect to see continued strong contributions from our Supply Chain division. And finally, as further validation of our value we bring to the channel and to our vendor partners, earlier this week, we were recognized by HP as their 2015 PartnerOne Global Distributor of the Year as well as their Enterprise Group Growth Distributor for the United States at the HP Global Partner Conference in Las Vegas. These awards underscore both our longstanding commitment to HP, our largest vendor partner, and the focused execution our teams have throughout the world. HP's PartnerOne program complements Tech Data's long-term strategy for growth and profitability, and we look forward to continued mutual success with one of our most strategic vendor partners. As we look ahead, we plan to continue our relentless focus on profitable growth, selling the right products at the right price to the right customers. Market share gains will be supported by expanding our relationship with key vendor partners who understand the power of distribution and are looking to put more of their products into the channel, as well as by winning new customers in all regions. In summary, I'm proud of our teams' achievements and the considerable progress we made in fiscal 2015, but we have clearly turned our attention to the many opportunities that lie ahead. In fiscal 2016, we'll continue to optimize our operations and leverage our cost structure by aligning resources with more profitable, higher growth areas of our business, all the while driving our strategy of execution, diversification and innovation. We believe this will enable us to achieve our financial objectives of share gains in selected product areas, improved earnings in local currency, positive cash flow generation and return on invested capital above our benchmark weighted average cost of capital. I'd like to extend our thanks to our vendors and our customers for their business and their partnership and to my Tech Data colleagues for their continued hard work and dedication throughout fiscal 2015. Thank you. We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question today is coming from Benjamin Reitzes from Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Inc. Good. I got a couple of questions. I heard you're just talking about HP there, and if I run the math, HP revenues through you guys was down over 20% year-over-year using the percentage you gave me a year ago. And that sounds like actually HP maybe disproportionately hit by your move out of certain segments and you're walking away from certain business in the U.S. And I just wanted to reconcile that you have this – you're talking about the partnership, but it looks like revenues plummeted from them. And just trying to reconcile that and I have a couple more. Jeffery P. Howells - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Director Ben, I mean, the math is the math. But I mean, at the end of the day whether it's HP or one of our other vendor partners, we're trying to move the bar up on the return that we get from the sales. And in some markets, in some customer sets, there are vendors that have declines in their business. Now, I can't say that it all relates to our profit improvement programs, but – I mean that is one element and the other is the cycle of demand including the volume of business we did last year with them versus the volume we did this year. So, one, we can't change the history. Two, we sell to the market. Three, our diversification gives us the opportunity to grow other vendor partners when their products are in high demand like our growth in the last two years with Apple, and it becoming a bigger percentage of our business. Robert M. Dutkowsky - Chief Executive Officer & Director I think you also have to look at the HP awards that we received, the Global Distributor of the Year, and then, the Growth Distributor in the U.S. around their enterprise products. Put those two things together, you can assume that we deselected some PC revenues that maybe weren't as profitable, and we invested and performed well in the enterprise space. Robert M. Dutkowsky - Chief Executive Officer & Director So, it's a perfect example of the description we gave where we're trying to trade off revenues for more profitable revenues. And I think you can see that inside the year-over-year comparison you're trying to make with HP. Underneath it, that churn happened inside HP as well. Jeffery P. Howells - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Director Jeffery P. Howells - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Director ...Ben, you have to be careful in Q4 on the currency. For the year, it's not as big of an impact. But in Q4, certainly, our European exchange rate had an impact because HP is so important to us and to Europe. Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Inc. Okay. Well, it looks like your guidance has also – means like another adjustment into this quarter and beyond. But the other question is with regard to the U.S. So, your performance and your guidance, the U.S. market – you're kind of guiding, it looks like a low market. And we're trying to figure out how much because you said federal, healthcare, and education were all good. It sounds like the U.S. economy is obviously more stable and the U.S. market seems to be doing a lot better than what you've put up and guided and I know you're walking away from some business. So could you just tell us what you think the U.S. IT market is growing? And are there any – what the big problems are, if there are any, is it this XP thing or is everything pretty cool in the U.S. and you just – the difference between you and what we were thinking is simply you walking away from business. Jeffery P. Howells - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Director Yeah. I think it's that, plus – so first of all, you have the $75 million of exit from Chile, Peru, and Uruguay. Then you also have the fact that we had an extremely strong Q1 last year with the highest growth, by far, about 8% in the Americas versus a few percent average in Q2 and Q3 and then down 5% in Q4. So, the trend, as we priced ourselves out of business and reallocated our resources to more profitable business, to get leverage out of a flat cost infrastructure, to expand operating margins will continue into this new fiscal year. The goal is to focus on those high growth areas, whether it's in the segment like federal or healthcare or education. And then under the covers, there are product categories that are growing, and then growing anywhere from low to mid to high-single digits so that we grow the business in the appropriate areas. We have clearly exited business that's not profitable. I can give you example of $100 million of revenue with one customer that competitors bid at a price that mathematically there is no way to make any money and so we exited that business in the second half of the year. We are here to serve our vendors, we're here to serve our customers, but our investors and our return on invested capital is also very important to us. So as long as the market can be served by others that want to serve it with less prosperity that's fine. And if it blends into their equation and it works for them, it's fine. But it didn't work for us. We think there are some very exciting growth areas. I mean, Bob mentioned one storage EMC and some other vendors where we've been appointed in both regions to help grow their business. So, underneath the covers, there's a lot of opportunity. Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Inc. Okay. And then just finally on currency, you said negative $0.17 year-over-year. What was your expectation going in that the hit would be on EPS? I assumed a lot lower than that, and what should we assume the year-over-year hit is for this fiscal year, per quarter, is it something like that every quarter based on your $1.05 to €1 range? Jeffery P. Howells - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Director Yeah. I mean, I would say it was about half. I mean, the currency depreciated probably twice the rate we anticipated. So, we probably modeled, make it $0.07 or $0.08 more than we're able to report. As far as the year, the consensus today of the median (35:17) of the banks that we poll is €1 of about $1.05 exchange rate for the year. There clearly are financial institutions that have gone to parity. For the quarter to-date, the exchange rate is better than that $1.05 that we're projecting for this quarter and for the fiscal year. Truly, no one knows, but that'll be the difference between, off the top of my head, I think our exchange rate was like $1.28 this past year. So, it will have a headwind on the reported results like any other enterprise. But then we have to look at the positives of the move towards parity. And, of course, I'm not an economist but the positives are the strength that it could result in the European economies and their ability to escalate exports which means more production, which means more hiring, which means more demand for technology and more ability to buy technology as the year evolves. And so, if you look at the one side, it's a short-term headwind; on the other side, it could be an extremely positive gain in momentum in demand and that may not happen until later this year but clearly is a potential outcome on the horizon. Robert M. Dutkowsky - Chief Executive Officer & Director Hey, Ben, it's Bob. I just want to give you one other piece of color on the U.S. and the Americas. I tried in my prepared comments to show you where we think there's opportunity for us both market opportunity and for us to improve our execution. Clearly, our core VAR marketplace represents opportunities. There's tens of thousands of VARs in the U.S. that we don't do business with today. So, by toning that organization's focus, we think that there's upside there. We clearly see upside in the mobility and retail space, and we put a dedicated team in place to go after that market opportunity. And the successes that we've had in the supply chain have given us confidence to continue to invest in that space and to add unique value to our vendor partners by investing in those value propositions. So, there's three areas, and the fourth area would be the data center and we continue to perform well there in the Americas. So upside in the VAR community, upside in retail and mobility and upside in supply chain, and continued execution in the data center is the pathway for accelerating our growth and profitability in the Americas. Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Brian Alexander from Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. Brian G. Alexander - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. All right. Thanks and good morning, guys. Jeff, on the European margins, I thought it was pretty impressive that you were able to hold operating margins flat in the fourth quarter especially with the euro depreciating sharply in the month of January, and given comments from your largest competitor about currency volatility impacting pricing and margins, I think a lot of that was in retail where you don't participate. But nevertheless, can you talk about the performance in more detail, and, more importantly, the margin outlook in Europe going forward? I think the last two years you've been around 50 basis points, 60 basis points of operating margin in the first quarter, and around 90 basis points to 100 basis points for the year. Is that realistic to sustain in this environment with the currency volatility or should we expect currency to have more of an impact on margins going forward than what we saw in Q4 where you were actually up a little bit? Jeffery P. Howells - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Director Yeah. I don't – I mean, our current belief is that currency volatility isn't going to have an impact on the quality of our results by quarter. Clearly, it will have an impact on the quantity of our results that convert back. We're going to take a cautious approach to the revenue opportunity in the near-term, although, clearly, we believe that as the euro settles down, there will be a net growth opportunity available to us in Europe throughout the fiscal year, the timing of which is subject to the uncertainty at this point in time. Back to Q4, specifically, I would say two things. One, from a company perspective, we're in two different states, in Americas versus Europe, in the quality improvement in our revenue. The European team is probably a step ahead and whether that's one, two, three or four quarters ahead of the Americas team, that's to be determined. And so, in both geos, we were able to leverage a flattish cost structure and improve the revenue that we put through it. We have to be conscious of market share, but you can see that we did that in Europe and we increased the operating results in Europe with a low to mid-single digit growth or mid-single digit growth in euros. So the leverage is there as we reallocate resources and that was the goal in FY 2015. And it's a continued goal as we go into FY 2016 as we stated over 12 months ago. It really put us in place for performance in FY 2017. If we look at the Americas, the Americas did a great job in leveraging better revenue through a flattish cost structure to expand the operating margin. Yes, it resulted in a Q4 decline. Yes, we thought the market was going to – opportunity was going to be stronger in Q4. And was it deferred if we missed an opportunity, I mean, all that is subject to evaluation and detailed evaluation internally here. But the result was we leveraged the infrastructure, we had the best result in 10 quarters in the Americas with a decline in revenue. That's good execution in the view of using your asset better to deliver the right products to the customers. And combined in both regions, the gross margin exceeded our expectation. So what does that mean? That means that we could take some more revenue in both regions and leverage the infrastructure, which could lead to some gross margin moving back towards the prior averages of the quarters. But that's the upside. That's the good news that the cleansing has happened and we have the opportunity to take advantage of market opportunities as we move forward. Brian G. Alexander - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Are the management changes that you're making in the Americas related to the Q4 performance and the revenue decline or are those independent decisions? Jeffery P. Howells - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Director That actually kind of – just the time is the time. We are taking one of our more seasoned executives and having him work directly with Bob and as he did eight years ago, when Bob came to the company. He launched our AIS division and he's going to do the same now looking at other vendor opportunities as the technology changes and we want to be a little more nimble on what's next versus being there may be a day, a quarter or a year late. And then, fortunately, on the inside, we have reallocated our sales effort. So, we don't really have someone in charge of U.S. sales anymore. We've broken it down into three or four distinct sets with the mobility and retail and the supply chain services and then the VAR and major customers. So, it's really kind of a realignment and this was the final step in what we announced internally the last – earlier this quarter, I believe. Robert M. Dutkowsky - Chief Executive Officer & Director Yeah. So, Brian, it was the perfect time to – as we launch into the new year to have a structure that's more in tune with the realities of where the opportunities in the market. So, if you think of what we've described, we have an acute focus on the VAR channel. We have an acute focus on the data center. We have an acute focus on mobility and retail. And we have an acute focus on supply chain. If you put that up to a mirror, it would look very much the same in Europe. And so, now, our deployment is consistent. The voices that we have to the vendors have become more consistent and that helps us to manage the vendor relationships better. And it also gives Joe Quaglia and Néstor Cano more granularity as they manage their business and their portfolio of businesses to see where we're performing well, where we're not performing well, where we're gaining share, where profitability is correct. And so, it's just a smart change in the organization of the Americas business to make the moves that we described. Brian G. Alexander - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Let me just ask one final one on book value. It's a short answer. So Jeff, I think you said $52 at the end of the quarter. When you look at book value going forward, given the slide in the euro since the end of the quarter and the associated impact on asset value re-measurement, I think is the term, should we expect to see the book value go below $50 in the next quarter? I know it's not precise to correlate the euro to other comprehensive income, but the last two quarters, it's had like a $3 to $4 impact per quarter on book value. So, I'm just kind of curious kind of where book value might bottom. Thanks. Jeffery P. Howells - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Director Yeah. Give me the euro exchange rate on April 30 and I'll give you the exact number. Jeffery P. Howells - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Director Yeah. I mean well, at $1.05 compared to the conversion rate that we used in the quarter, I don't have that rate on top of my head, but it would be that impact on our European assets. So, yeah, it could go down some, but I think the major impacts out of it. I'll have to look up what the January 31 rate was. I don't recall what it was. Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I have a couple if I could. I guess the first one is, again, on the margin. How should we think about the dynamics on gross margin in the April quarter and then maybe even kind of a little beyond that with regards to seasonality as well if we go through the year? Jeffery P. Howells - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Director Yeah. Ananda, this is Jeff. We don't give guidance on the line items, but I don't think our theory has changed. If you look at what we just reported, the gross margin was just over 5% for the year. The prior year, it was 4 basis points higher than that. Our product and customer mix is around a 5% mix right now. And we clearly don't know whether it's 5 basis points above or under, but that 5% mix target and that's up to our teams to seek out the best business to leverage infrastructure and get the return on invested capital. But looking at blending opportunity for higher margin products with the profitability of some lower margin products like software that utilizes less capital that blend and the customer opportunities we have is in that 5% range. All that being said, if we can – depending on a quarter, if there is more growth in data center versus mobility and software, you're going to have a quarter with higher or if it's the opposite direction, you're going to have a quarter with lower gross margin. But, that's our day job. I mean, that's what we got to do each and every quarter. The most important aspect of FY 2015 that just ended and going into 2016 is, we're going to continue to attempt to leverage the existing infrastructure and reallocate resources to the growth and profitable areas of the business and have a maniacal focus on the overall profitability of a customer-and-vendor engagement and the return on invested capital which we continue to – we increased our returns this year by 10% like our operating income, like our net income, like our EPS. Some of those metrics aren't going to be able to grow at the same rate next year, because of the euro exchange rate that we're anticipating, but we still like to improve our return on invested capital going forward. And this will be year two of the operational focus, and not that every year isn't – but, we're more focused in 2015 and 2016. And we believe that's going to set us up extremely well as we exit 2016 into 2017. Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC And on the – that's really useful, Jeff. Thanks. I guess, as you think about mix of business, kind of given the way you've cultivated the portfolio over the last couple of years, what should we expect the seasonality to be in April Q, July Q, given the new mix of business? Are there any meaningful shifts? Jeffery P. Howells - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Director I don't know if there'll be a meaningful shift compared to FY 2015. And so, depending on which line you're talking about, the real, I think, difference is going to be the absorption of the theory in Europe of the volatility of the currency, do people buy quick, do they defer, do they have more to spend, do they have less. And there's going to be all of that. There is going to be every different country, every different customer set, every different opportunity is going to have both sides of that pendulum. And then in the Americas, it's going to be kind of the – in our belief, the – approaching the final quarter of the annualization of our – really our push to profit improvement, customer selection, vendor selection and focusing on pricing ourselves out of that business that didn't have the right returns and that somewhat annualizes as we move through and out of Q1 into the next quarter. Robert M. Dutkowsky - Chief Executive Officer & Director Ananda, it's Bob. I do think, though, when you think about mix, there will be a shift in spend from a PC-focused spend that happened last year as the XP refresh process happened. And we believe those – many of those budget dollars are going to move into data center refresh spends in this fiscal year. The Windows Server 2003 end-of-life that'll happen in the summertime will create an opportunity in the industry standard server space, and many small and medium size as well as large data centers will take a look at that opportunity to refresh other parts of the data center whether it's more efficient storage offerings or new networking technologies. And to strengthen our line card across all of those platforms, hardware and software, gives us, we believe, an opportunity to do well on the data center in this fiscal year. So, if you want to think about shift, mixed shift, I think there'll be a shift away from the PC more towards the data center in this year versus last year. Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC Which would suggest potential for higher – for a mix up on the gross margins (52:50) Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC Yeah. Yeah. That's useful, guys. And, I guess, just one last one for me. The last two years, Jeff, SG&A dollars have been flat in the April quarter coming off of the Jan quarter, should we expect a similar dynamic this year? Jeffery P. Howells - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Director Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC What would be the dynamics, I guess, this year that would impact... Jeffery P. Howells - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Director Dynamics would be the FX rate will be materially different. So, yeah, actual reported dollars would be very likely lower, virtually impossible not to be lower. So, it's really the leverage we'll get – what leverage we can get, on the momentum that we've had in the last few quarters leveraging our infrastructure as a percentage of sales. Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC Okay. It sounds like you guys are optimistic to continue to get that leverage based on your previous comments. Jeffery P. Howells - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Director Yeah. I mean that's the goal in 2015 which we achieved, and the goal in 2016, which is our aspiration, is to have the right revenue which may or may not have significant growth depending on how the market develops. But leverage that growth – those gross margin dollars of a better quality against the infrastructure to improve the operating results by SG&A leverage. Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC William Charles Shope - Goldman Sachs & Co. Okay. Thank you. You guys have given a lot of commentary around the various demand dynamics, but I want to make sure I understand it. So, if we exclude the business that you walked away from, it sounds like you really weren't calling out any notable PC weakness for the prior quarter. So, I guess, related to that, what were the key products that you had mentioned weakened late in the quarter? And then, back to PCs, we've obviously seen several PC-related companies issue disappointing news in recent weeks. So, as we progress through the current quarter, what are you thinking for that end market and related categories off of that? Jeffery P. Howells - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Director Well, let me start with, I think it ties into Bob's original comment that in the Americas we saw weakness in the second half of the quarter across the board. Although I did call out that we had positive growth still in notebooks in different sectors of the business that didn't fall off. So, the question was, is the desktop refresh complete? People are still buying notebooks. But our second half of Q4 in the Americas did not end up with the same volume and velocity that we had anticipated and we don't believe we lost a significant amount of share. Could we have lost a point or something, sure, we could have, but that's the interaction of pricing ourselves out of the business. I gave an example of $100 million that we annualized business that we priced ourselves out of somewhere – and my recollection is Q3. So that will ripple through the coming fiscal year for at least the first half or more. I don't remember the exact timing and that's just one example. There's smaller examples to compound the equivalent numbers but the outcome is quite obvious. We used our assets more effectively and efficiently to grow our operating profits in both regions and to increase the operating percentage of our results and that's the game plan going forward. Quality revenue, every piece of revenue, every opportunity is not good. But as Bob said, the data center accelerates this year. There's great opportunities there with hardware and storage. And the flipside of that, that will also, hopefully, bring in software upgrade and more volume there which has a lower margin, but it supplies the capital to fund the hardware piece of our business. So the rates blend down. Again, we have the growth, we have replacement revenue for, say, PC growth this past year and the goal is again to leverage the cost to expand. So there's not one product that I could call out to finalize my comment in Q4 second half that was the absolute most disappointing. For us, business was just soft and it doesn't tie with, quite frankly, what others have said even our competitors. But we have to remember the two key competitors that most of you follow reported through November and then reported through December, but did not report through January. And now, we have vendors coming out, as someone referenced the Intel news and saying things have gotten softer. So I think we've reported the first of the softer months of the new fiscal year and we still made money. William Charles Shope - Goldman Sachs & Co. Okay, that's helpful. Related to your buyback, you completed that authorization fairly quickly. So, obviously, too soon to be talking about the next one, but how do you think about your use of cash from here and your appetite for further capital allocation back to shareholders versus strategic options in M&A? Robert M. Dutkowsky - Chief Executive Officer & Director Well, we have a well-established history of when we announce a buyback, we execute a buyback. And so, you could see we executed the last one very efficiently. And the board looks every quarter at capital allocations and opportunities that sit in front of us whether they be continued buybacks or M&A or just funding organic growth and all three of those are considered every quarter. And I think you can see our board favors the buyback option. But keep in mind, over the last seven or eight years, we bought 17 companies and spent $850 million of capital on acquisitions as well. So, over that timeframe of the last handful of years, we've not only returned to our shareholders, but we've also invested for our strategic long-term growth. And that's been our strategy, and I would assume that our board will stick to that same game plan. William Charles Shope - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jim Suva from Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. James Dickey Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker) Thanks very much and congratulations. You guys have been in this business a very long time and a lot of times you're the gainer of share gains and this time you talk about walking away from some business or basically not receiving but giving up some share gains. So you're typically a lot of times a bidder (1:00:21) and now you're giving up some share gains. You're talking about the unprofitability of pricing, there's lots of ways to interpret this. Could it be that you don't have scale in certain regions or your cost structure isn't aligned or someone else's cost structure is better or they're building in making money on additional peripheral sales? Or how can we help better understand your view on what metrics are you looking at because I doubt that they are actually selling it for a loss-making business? Jeffery P. Howells - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Director Well, I wouldn't assume your last part of your statement is accurate, but the rest of it's easy to address. We're in a growing IT market right now and the year had more growth in it than we anticipated it for demand for IT products. And in a growing demand environment, you have that opportunity to have a better selection process and what revenue you want to put through your model. And that is very hard to do in a slow-to-flat-to-down IT market. So it was a perfect opportunity to accelerate the revenue exchange better, bad business, whatever you want to call it, to improve the quality. Now, we are very cognizant of market share and relevance to the vendors, the customers, and all those other attributes. So, I mean, we're not looking to shrink the company. But it was a great opportunity. The market PC refresh, the mobility growth we saw in Europe, I mean, there's many things that we saw. And as you can see, our efforts, our selection process while the top line may not have been what people had wanted, the bottom line hopefully was acceptable. 10% growth, hope I'm not misquoting 10% growth in operating income, net income, EPS, and 10% improvement in return on invested capital to 11% versus 10%. We had a great year. And so a lot of that effort on the revenue is completed. But I'll also say it's also like a stock portfolio. There's always a bottom performer in a portfolio and you keep determining when to part ways with that stock and we'll do that with the volume in our historical volume customer-vendor relationships. There's also the newcomers, there's new opportunities, especially in the data center this coming year for us to expand. So under the covers, we have countries that grew 20%. Italy and Spain, I think were two that I had mentioned. France had a continued strong growth. Under the covers in both geographies we have product categories that grew 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%. I mean, clearly, we have some that grew 100%, but off their very small numbers. But significant revenue bases that grew mid-single-digits to mid-teens. So the exchange in trying to go where the market is going and, I mean, that's another reason why we've just established working with Bob, another focus on vendor development, business development, so that we can keep finding the newer opportunities and demonstrating our value proposition to those vendors that aren't as familiar with the distribution channel and our access to over 100,000 resellers out there. Robert M. Dutkowsky - Chief Executive Officer & Director Jim, I think that you have to factor in the mix not only of geographies, but also of customers and also of product focuses. When you compare us with other IT distributors, really none of us are mirror images anymore. And so when you try to compare one versus the other, your ability to clearly compare really – as time goes on is getting harder and harder. We think that's goodness because each of the distributors have become more and more specialized in areas, whether it's geographies, whether it's categories inside of IT spending. And, therefore, the vendors can rely on us more, the customers can rely on us more, but our mixes look very different. And so that's why as Jeff walked you through kind of the report card for the company over the course of the year, double-digit growth in the profitability measurements, strong return on invested capital, that's the Tech Data model. That's our model that we're driving the business towards. Our competitors' models may look different. And there's room for different models as we support this IT ecosystem with our value proposition. James Dickey Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker) And as a follow-up, am I correct that what changed with it was the pricing environment on some of those items or did the vendor rebate environment change or both? Robert M. Dutkowsky - Chief Executive Officer & Director It's both. In some cases, the vendor programs change. They always change, though, Jim. They change quarterly, they change year-to-year as they adjust their routes to market and the cost structures that they want to have in their routes to market. But as Jeff was describing, we have a process in both geographies to look at by customer, by SKU, by geography where we have deals that don't deliver the profitability and/or return on invested capital metrics that we drive the business to. And we select our way out of those. It doesn't mean that we abandon the customer, but we may abandon a SKU at a customer. It doesn't mean we abandon a vendor, we may abandon a product at a customer. So it's a well-orchestrated process that runs in our geographies every single day that we're open for business. In good growth environment, it allows us to run that play more aggressively. In low growth or declining markets, every sales opportunity takes on a different flavor. So over the course of the year, we were able to be more selective on our revenue and go-to-market opportunities. And we executed against our plan efficiently and effectively. As we said, good growth in profitability metrics and strong return on invested capital metrics for the year. Osten H. Bernardez - Cross Research LLC Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just real quickly. I just wanted to get further color, if I may, on the types of businesses you're considering walking away from or that you did walk away from in the Americas. You noted that obviously you're still growing some notebook revenue and perhaps there's some slowdown in desktops has been discussed, but could you be a bit more precise in terms of what you're eyeing for 2016 in terms of potentially pruning your SKUs? Robert M. Dutkowsky - Chief Executive Officer & Director Yeah. One of the things that's interesting about our business, Osten, is that it comes up for bid virtually every day, every week, every month, every quarter. We have annual contracts that we negotiate. And so, when you look at all of those opportunities, they present us with the chance to reevaluate the profitability of opportunities. And there are – and we take advantage of those opportunities to reassess, will that deal deliver the profit and return on invested capital that we believe we should get for the value that we add when go into the market. And so, when we talk about that analysis process. That's across our whole portfolio of products. It's not just PCs or desktops. There are data centers opportunities that we walk away from, because they don't deliver the right return on invested capital metrics or profitability. There are software opportunities that we price our way out of, so it's not just PCs. It's not just high-volume revenue opportunities. It sits across our whole portfolio and it's in the pricing and execution culture of our company to do that. The richer the market opportunities, the more able we are to be selective on revenue. Osten H. Bernardez - Cross Research LLC Got it. And then, lastly for me, I just wanted to get some color as to whether you're seeing any actual activity surrounding the Windows Server 2003 expiration. We've heard some mixed commentary as to others seeing either not much activity so far or a lot of activity, at least by the – at the end of 2014. What are you seeing or when do you expect that to pick up for you? Robert M. Dutkowsky - Chief Executive Officer & Director Yeah. I think that most of the end users are still in the planning stage. I saw some data just the other day that said – it said that it believed that 10% to 15% of the conversions have happened already. And the other 80%, 85% of the conversions are still available. But remember not all of those will go like-for-like, industry-standard server to industry-standard server. Some of that workload may move to larger server infrastructures, some of that may move to larger industry standard servers that are virtualized, some of that may move to the cloud, some of those applications may move to mobile devices. So I think CIOs are using this opportunity inside the data center to reevaluate certain applications and where they're executed. The good news for Tech Data is as the opportunities and the architectures I just described whether it's the cloud, whether it's proprietary servers, whether it's larger industry standard servers that are virtualized, whether it's small industry standard servers, we sell all of that. So, as the IT professionals make their choices as to where they're going to move these platforms and our VARs help them execute that, the VARs can turn to Tech Data make one phone call and buy all of those products. And that really is a powerful position for us to play in this transition that will happen inside the data center. Louis R. Miscioscia - CLSA Americas LLC Okay. Thanks. Hey, Bob you talked about some of the PC dollar refresh moving to other products. Maybe could you give us some idea did that thought come from conversations you had with IT industry guys, CIOs or did you obviously with all your years in the business sort of surmise that? And maybe also if you could give some clarification if it's a dollar-to-dollar swap in the sense that obviously the PC category from a dollar standpoint could be bigger than that. I'm just wondering if you still expect that same amount of dollars to shift over. Robert M. Dutkowsky - Chief Executive Officer & Director Yeah. Lou, that observation comes from triangulating our customers, their views and conversations with end-users and then what we hear from our vendor partners. Remember where we sit in this ecosystem. We hear from vendors that make everything from PCs and keyboards and tablets all the way up to make mainframe computers and all stops in between. And every year in their planning cycle, they try to figure out how the end user is going to spend his or her dollars. And last year was a year that was spent refreshing the PC. I mean, it's obvious. Whatever triangulation point you want to take, you could see the PC refresh happened last year. And it's safe to say that it's about completed. Those budget dollars that were spent in PCs last year, the whole ecosystem assumes that they're going to move into the data center and mobility products and security products, and in some cases, cloud investments. And so, as I just said, Tech Data has strong offerings in all of those places that everyone believes are going to be the good spending areas in this next year, the data center, mobility, security, and cloud. Tech Data is very well positioned to take advantage of those opportunities as CIOs and small business in conjunction with their VARs make choices. So how it splits, we don't need to really worry about it. We need to make sure we have the right products on our line card and that our people have the skills to lead the VARs to those decisions. So we're in good shape from that point of view. Louis R. Miscioscia - CLSA Americas LLC Okay. And then, the weakness that you saw in January which obviously you said that the December quarter companies obviously haven't seen yet, any explanation as to why? And then, also I guess as we're here in March is it something that was not just January or was it January, February and March that you're seeing? Jeffery P. Howells - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Director This is Jeff. I'll answer that. I mean, I think that is rolling into our forecast for Q1 partially. On the other hand, in the Americas, we grew 8% last year and that growth moderated in Q2 and Q3 and diminished in Q4. So I think it's a little more than just January. I mean, literally, the late December into January didn't materialize quite as we expected. Clearly, our expectations might have been focused in the wrong areas, but we still achieve the leverage we anticipated. So, it's – I mean it's – we believe to be conservative. We ought to assume that it will be the revenue that we anticipated here. And then, as I also mentioned in our comment in response to an earlier question, in Q1, we still have the annualization impact of exiting some revenue in Q2 and Q3 or Q4 that will have an impact on our Q1 and a little bit on our Q2. Louis R. Miscioscia - CLSA Americas LLC Okay. Then the last follow-up for (1:15:36) which products are you possibly singling out as the ones that have been affected more from this weakness beyond PCs which we all know about? Thank you. Jeffery P. Howells - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Director Yeah. I don't think we'd give any product detail. As I mentioned previously, it was kind of across the board. While there are pockets that were less or more impacted than others, there's really nothing significant that we'd be able to share. Louis R. Miscioscia - CLSA Americas LLC Okay. Thanks, guys. Good luck on the new year. Thank you. This concludes Tech Data Corporation's fiscal year 2015 fourth quarter earnings conference call.
