Inflation, Infrastructure And Stocks | Seeking Alpha With considerations, a future infrastructure bill should be supportable. Inflation helps equities and can result from construction spending. Among economists, some can be helpful toward understanding issues that influence public markets. One is Nouriel Roubini, who is by no means obscure. He fields some difficult questions and has been close to correct, if not right, with comments such as these: "Pots of money will be found for Greece," "China is going to have a bumpy landing," and that in the long term the price of oil should not be "$80 to $90" but "$50 to $60" because US shale will be incentivized to produce . He has also previously stated that Europe has bailout fatigue at the core and austerity fatigue at the periphery, and this was maybe 9-12 months ago, prior to the United Kingdom's plebiscite vote for independence. He is known for predicting the recession in 2008-9, or at least being identified that way in Dr. Bill Conerly's new book in a chapter entitled the "Failure of forecasts - You Won't See The Next Recession Coming." Roubini offers a similar statement on one of his websites - where you can learn about criteria the Federal Reserve uses to adjust interest rates. There does seem to be a collective opinion that forecasting is particularly difficult, at least among parties concerned with business or risk taking. However, pertaining to the US economy, MarketWatch runs a contest to determine those who are best at it. A current article identifies the most recent winners . Contestants are not professors or university officials, and include employees of banks and financial institutions. Data that they predict include a Consumer Price Index (CPI) measure. The contest winners are predicting inflation or rising prices. Inflation is generally helpful to stocks. Thus there could still be a favorable backdrop to indices such as the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA: SPY ), which has been setting all-time high marks. While citing hesitation toward the predictive powers of economists, extending to those who have been setting themselves apart under objective measures, domestic inflation can potentially be facilitated by a new spending bill to spur construction. Investment in roads, bridges and other transportation infrastructure requires manpower that is difficult to outsource. A 2014 government document specifies that every $1 billion in public infrastructure spending creates 13,000 jobs. The Annual Report of Martin Marietta Materials (NYSE: MLM ) says that each $1 billion spent on highways in specific creates 28,000. While differing viewpoints have been present within the US Federal Reserve, improving labor market conditions are still believed to put at least some upward pressure on inflation. A new infrastructure spending bill, creating employment, would be signed under our next presidential administration and Congress. On the other hand, if there is a Democratic president and a Republican legislature, political obstacles may be inevitable. Data shows that the $800 billion stimulus package passed as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 did not achieve its desired objectives in terms of employment, resulting in about 500,000 jobs , though several successes are also cited . Those who are supportive of such fiscal measures have consistently criticized the Act as too small; however, the point here is that its results can amount to political fodder. At any rate, a new spending bill would be a 2017 event. There are some shocks that can occur before then. They include intensifying stress in Europe, Japanese bonds that yield negative rates while the Bank of Japan buys up its stock market , and perhaps a turbulent Chinese reckoning with all of the dead weight in its banking system. Any effects that ultimately result from these situations can be far reaching and possibly severe. If an economic karst appears this year, it could - and probably should - result in a better deal on stocks of corporations that offer products used in the building of roads. Companies that focus on cement or materials utilised to make asphalt known as aggregates, can do well. To reiterate, infrastructure spending should help some firms in specific, amid simultaneous inflationary potential. From the following group, Vulcan Materials (NYSE: VMC ) is trading near all-time highs and above the average of peers. MDU Resources (NYSE: MDU ) is more of a natural resources company and left out; though its higher dividend could prove worthwhile. Cemex (NYSE: CX ) of Mexico could even have difficulty if there is a Trump presidency and the construction/erection of a wall along the national border. Though Vulcan is generally held in high regard, MLM summarily appears to offer a better deal. However, like Vulcan, it is also trading near an all-time high. Therefore, if there is not a simple pullback, a market-wide selloff could present an opportunity. Some economists are vocal that forecasting is not reliable, as it affords no protection to risk takers. Others have been shown as better at predicting than their peers through the results of an online publication. If the latter grouping is right about inflation, there could be further upside to equities. However, an infrastructure spending bill that spurs employment and also rising prices is not guaranteed. Thus, with the stocks at all-time highs, there should be a chance to monitor the prospects of Martin Marietta Materials and its peers for a better opportunity.
