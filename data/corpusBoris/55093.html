We are pleased to have delivered another strong quarter characterized by record revenues, margin improvement and continued profitability. Our record revenues in the quarter are largely result of the $11.5 million realized from our project at Dover Air Force Base and to a lesser extent contributions from our Waller acquisition. As we said during previous calls, the Dover contract as a total value of $98.3 million, which we expect to realize is an approximate 50/50 split between fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016. During the coming quarter and into the first quarter of 2016 as we move through spring and summer, we expect construction activity to continue to ramp up as weather patterns remain favorable for construction. While this is a significant contract from a revenue standpoint, the margins are compressed because of the nature of the work straight construction and the fact that we are the prime contractor and such are sub-contracting much of the work. However, in addition to the notable revenue value, the Dover project also enables Versar showcase our extensive capabilities and increase our visibility in the marketplace. Overall, gross margin improved 8% compared to 5% in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 despite the continued wind down of our Title 2 work in Afghanistan. To be clear, while we expect our Title 2 work for the U.S. Air Force in Afghanistan to be completed during our fiscal year 2016, we continued to win and perform new work under our personal services contract for the U.S. army core of engineers in the region. We continue to make progress managing expenses during the quarter as such our cost containment efforts are moving in the right direction and we expect to realize additional efficiencies moving forward. As of March 27, 2015, our backlog was $228 million, 100% increase compared to the funded backlog of $114 million at the end of fiscal year 2014. Through our acquisitions of Waller and GMI, we have expanded our portfolio of capabilities and solutions resulting in more contracts won, enhanced pipeline and significant backlog growth. During the quarter, we announced a number of new awards including a $6.1 million award to our joint venture with Johnson Controls for design build repair task orders for electrical, water transmission and compressed air systems at both Kaena Point Satellite Tracking Station, Hawaii, and at Laughlin Air Force Base in Texas. The joint venture was also awarded a $2 million contract to provide design/build construction services for upgrades and repairs at Camp Arifjan, Kuwait. Following the close of the quarter, the joint venture with Johnson Controls was awarded a $7 million contract to provide design/build construction services for repairs of the Blue Brick buildings at the Kuwait Naval base. We are pleased to provide our solutions to military installations in Kuwait particularly given the plan wind down of activities in Afghanistan and Iraq. Additionally, after the quarter closed we received a new single award GSA contract comprised of one base year and four option years with the maximum contract capacity of $23 million. For the ongoing facility support of U.S. Army Reserve 88th Regional Support Command in the Northwest Region of the U.S. We are also awarded an $11 million contract from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for continued work at Joint Base Lewis-McChord and Yakima Training Center. With working capital over $22 million, our balance sheet remains strong and is a significant asset to our company. I will now turn it over to our Executive President and CFO, Cynthia Downes to review our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2015. Versar quarter gross revenue of $39.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2015, an increase of 41% compared to $28.2 million last year. The increase in revenue is related to our Dover Air Force Base project as well as revenue contributions from Waller. Gross margin improved to 8% compared to 5% in the same quarter last year largely due to Waller, which partially offset the decline of our Title 2 work in Afghanistan and Iraq that impacted the ECM segment. Additionally, margins in the PSG segment were compressed related to the integration but with that effort largely complete, we expect to see margins in our PSG segment return to previous levels and help up that decline with experienced ECM related to the decline in our international work. Purchase, services and materials for the third quarter increased 56% to $22 million as a result of higher subcontractor costs. We continue to see increased need to subcontract the ECM services in order to provide a broader range of services to customers in this segment. Also with that ECM, we see an increase in the proportion of revenue from single award past quarters for Versar is a general contractor and uses subcontractors to form a portion of the contracts. However, in the ESG segment, as it continued to grow our internal capabilities, we anticipate a decreased need subcontractor services. Direct costs and services and overhead increased to approximately 10% or $1.6 million primarily related to additional costs associated with the Waller acquisition. SG&A expenses in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 increased to $2.7 million or 7% of sales compared to $2.3 million or 8% of sales in the third quarter of last year. Sequentially, SG&A expenses came down by approximately 7% compared to second quarter of fiscal 2015. The company recorded operating income of $622,000 for the third quarter of fiscal 2015 compared to an operating loss of $486,000 in the third quarter of fiscal 2014. Net income for the quarter was $262,000 or $0.03 per share on a fully diluted basis compared to a net income of $131,000 or loss of $0.01 per share on a fully diluted basis for the third quarter of the prior fiscal year. Now focusing on the operating results of our business segments for the third quarter of fiscal 2015; engineering and construction management, gross revenue was $23.2 million, an increase of 52% compared to the third quarter of last year. This increase primarily resulting from $11.5 million in revenue from the Dover project and $1.8 million from contracts we have obtained through our Waller acquisition. Gross margin in this segment was 9% compared to 11% last year. The slight decline is related to our work at Dover, we are the prime contractor on a project where subcontractors performed the majority of our work. Environmental services, revenue was $11.4 million an increase of 12% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2014 largely due to revenue from Waller. Gross profit for the segment was $831,000 an increase of more than 400% compared to a loss in the third quarter of fiscal 2014, Waller contributing approximately $378,000 to this improved gross margin. Gross margin in the segment was 7% compared to negative 3% last year. As we grow our internal capabilities organically through acquisitions, we are pursuing larger contracts, expect to continue reduction of these subcontractorship to direct labor. We therefore expect our ASG margins to remain at the current level in future quarters. Professional services, gross revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2015 was $5.2 million an increase of 88% over the third quarter of fiscal 2014. This increase was largely due to revenue contributions from Waller. Gross margin for the group was 8% compared to 4% last year. The gross margin increase is due to an increase in revenue. As we continue to eliminate excess overhead cost, we anticipate continued improvement in our PSG gross margins. Our strategic acquisitions have enhanced our capabilities and strengthened our competitive advantage and visibility in the marketplace. And we are executing well in the opportunities we have captured resulting in continued backlog growth. Likewise, our project pipeline is robust and we are favorably positioned to convert RF wins to contract wins. Our ability to provide a broad range of customized solutions in virtually any location or environment is the foundation of our success. And our recent acquisitions have further expanded our product offerings. We believe that we have the building block in place to continue to grow our customer base further improve revenue and margin performance and achieve sustained profitability. And with that, thank you all very much for you continuous support. And I will now turn it over to – back over to Dave to begin the Q&A portion of the call. Thank you. At this time, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Josh Nichols with B. Riley. Please proceed with your question. Yes. Yes. So it looks like everything is on track with Dover and give me a comment on what margins will look like for the quarter, if you were to back up that $11 million at Dover low margin revenue? It would certainly be higher in terms of – on a percentage basis. I mean Dover obviously as we have said all along was going to be a low margin project competitively bid horizontal construction with some big guys going after it. It would in my opinion, we haven't actually done the analysis, but Dover with $11 million, so 25 – little over 25 almost 30% of the total revenue that we have in the quarter at that lower margin, we would have seen, I think we would have seen ECM back up in the more traditionally closer to the 11% that they have historically performed. So I would think, we would have been closer to the double-digit margins on a blended basis without Dover. Great. And then, I guess, it looks like last quarter was, I guess likely the low for cash balance, due you expect that to continue to improve over the next couple of quarters? Well, yes. We are consistently profitable now, so we are generating cash again. I mean obviously, the big issue you can see it in our balance sheet is the receivables that built-up the lot of that unbilled due to the Dover project. We are – we have – we flow our terms and conditions down to our subs. So its paid when paid. So the Dover project is not really a significant impact on our cash because we don't have to pay our sub until we get paid by the government. And they are paying pretty promptly. So yes, I would expect to see us continue to be able to improve our situation. Now, obviously, part of that is, we are continuing to pay down debt. So we have significantly reduced – basically, we have one payment left under the [Sharon] [ph] acquisition, which will be done by the end of May. And then by the end of September, we have the last payment due on the GMI acquisition. So by the end of September, by the end of the first quarter of our fiscal year 2016, we would have paid off all the debt associated with every acquisition expect for Waller. So I'm very pleased with that. And that's consistent with the commitment we had made earlier which is – we will be using the cash to reduce our debt balance, while we continue to look for future acquisitions. Right. And then, just looking real quick at some of the joint ventures like Johnson Controls looks like there has been some steady wins over the last couple of quarters. Over the last few quarters, has the company seen an increase in bidding activity as far as dollar that has been bid on or [once been] [ph] bided? We actually have, I mean we track that. We don't disclose it. We have been giving general directions and I mentioned that at/or around the time of the Waller acquisition between a combination of a lot of our – the legacy versus efforts as well as Waller efforts, we saw a significant increase in our pipeline effort. But, we have actually probably seen another 20% -- 10% to 15% increase in the overall pipeline. We have been much more aggressive in how we vet those. So it's a much higher quality pipeline. And its very nicely distributed between the four kind of categories we look at, which are kind of opportunities which tend to be 18 months to two years out. Pre-RFP, where we are pretty sure what it's going to look like, we are just waiting for the RFP to actually hit the street. Then RFP we are actually working on a hard proposal and then having – and the last group is pending. So when I look at those four categories, we are seeing very, very good distribution which gives me good comfort on how it's going to flow through our backlog. We feel very comfortable with our win rate. We feel very comfortable with the types of projects we are going after. So yes, we have seen an increase in the overall pipeline and we are feeling very good in terms of our expected values that we realized out of that. Great. And then last question for me, speaking a little bit in generalities and the pipeline is pretty big. Would you characterize gross margins for the pipeline as similar to where they stand now excluding Dover better worse or the same? What we have been saying – we have been saying for a while that we think our long-term margin should be in the low kind of teens. Dover obviously, we given its size, it's going to drag that down over the next six to nine months because of just – it's a huge amount of revenue flowing through. But we are very comfortable that the pipeline we have is consistent with where we think we should be in the long-term. [Operator Instructions] There are no further questions in queue at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to management for closing comments. Thank you, everybody. We'll be posting this broadcast to our Web site in the next couple of hours for anyone that would like to access it.
