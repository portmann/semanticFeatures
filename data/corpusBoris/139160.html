Learn more about PRO » Valmont is a play on the rise of infrastructure spending globally with shares benefiting from highway spending and farm agribusiness spend. The company is exposed to several cycles that have all combined to 'downturn' all at once despite the economy being in expansion. We think Valmont Industries (NYSE: VMI ) is the premier infrastructure stock play with businesses in several end-markets that support infrastructure build-out. They make many things that would benefit from higher federal spending on infrastructure, including highway construction products, utility towers, and traffic light poles. The market sentiment and sell-side research have reached their lows which is commensurate with the share price having dropped from ~$160 to the current $112. We think a long-term opportunity exists in the shares as the cycle turns and their Irrigation and Utility Support segments return to growth over the next year or two. We see the federal budget reaching levels, made healthier by a stronger employment market, supporting increased infrastructure spending. There are several factors for the depressed operating results and weak sentiment. The business has four operating segments: Utility Support Structures, Irrigation, Engineered Infrastructure, and Coatings. The irrigation segment, which provides agriculture irrigation equipment globally, along with the engineered infrastructure segment, which manufactures and distributes metal and composite structures for traffic signals and street lights, were the main drivers for growth over the last six years. More recently, those businesses have seen decreased demand due to the roll-off of the stimulus package and lower commodity prices, reducing overall demand. We think these two businesses are highly cyclical and that demand seems to peak and trough every four or five years. As the cycle peaked in 2012-2013, our long thesis rests on the cycle bottoming and believe it will likely rebound this year or next. In the Utility Support Structure segment (26% of sales), the larger projects haven't materialized over the last couple of years and the business contracted 15% in 2014. This is a cyclical business and with the market for large projects having dried up, price competition for smaller projects has intensified. We believe that the hit rate for Valmont among new smaller projects has declined due to management taking the path of rejecting low margin projects in favor of waiting out the market and raising prices outside of alliance customers. In Irrigation, volumes are declining due to the lower commodity prices pushing down farm income. We also think the yoy compares are being unfairly assessed due to last year (2013) sales benefiting from $15 million in revenue from storm damage. Additionally, this business has a large international component, namely a large Brazilian operation, that has been hit by the stronger US dollar. We are bullish on the segment as drought conditions in California and eventual dollar reversals will put in a bottom in the cycle. Medium-Term Bullish On US Infrastructure Spending We think the long-term prospects of the company are solid with public spending on infrastructure likely to turn on higher employment pushing up tax revenue at both the state and federal levels. In addition, the lower oil prices that have pushed down gasoline prices are increasing miles driven by US motorists. This will in turn deteriorate the road conditions faster and require added funding benefiting Valmont. Meanwhile, the business has several tentacles that permeate through different infrastructure "plays". Typically, this has reduced their cyclicality but in the current environment, they have seen several cycles coincide depressing operating results. But we believe that several of these cycles should shift at near the same time and create a large upside opportunity. One of the upside catalysts would be the passage of a longer-term highway funding bill. We think the prospects of such a deal are better than they have been in years. On July 22nd, the Senate voted to advance a six-year, $47 billion highway funding bill to help states repair crumbling roads and bridges throughout the country. While ultimate passage remains a question as lawmakers attach riders and controversial amendments to it, we think the passage of the bill is inevitable. For one, infrastructure spending is one of the few issues that receives bi-partisan support by both sides. Two, there is actual money in the budget for it this year as the deficit declines materially to sub-3%. Lastly, the trust fund is set to run out of money. The house recently passed a short-term three month patch while they and the Senate work out the differences between their respective bills. The long-term fix removes risk to the shares as for the last several years, congress has simply passed short-term patches. We see this, if it passes, as a significant boost to the shares and strongly beneficial to several segments of Valmont's business. Restructuring Plans Could Boost Margins Materially The company is exposed to several outside factors that have depressed recent results. We mentioned several of them above including the dollar strength and level of infrastructure spending. Additionally, their 'other' segment has been hurt by decreased mining activity in Australia. With several adverse factors hitting them at once, they have initiated a restructuring plan in order to reduce their cost footprint and operating expenses. Most of the restructuring activities will take place within their non-infrastructure businesses, like the 'other' segment, where an improvement in the Australian industrial and mining economy is not expected. Management expects the lower operating costs will be realized over the next twelve to eighteen months. Most of the restructuring is being conducted through reduced footprints consolidating facilities, mostly in Australia. We think the restructuring footprint and cost infrastructure will significantly increase the leverage opportunities as they climb out of this downturn in the cycle and end-markets improve. Even despite the reduction in facilities, they will still have significant capacity to meet increased demand when these markets turn so we do not see the need for capital spending for the foreseeable future. At the last peak two years ago, operating margins hit 16.6%, up 80 bps over the prior top in 2009. We think that they can achieve 100-200 bps improvement on the low-end at the next cycle peak after these restructuring activities. The shares are trading at the lower-end of their long-term range due to the weakness in the end-markets we discussed. At 8.1x EV/EBITDA, the shares trade below their long-term average of 9.3x, but are still above cyclical lows set in 2009 of 5.1x. However, comparing this environment and the one during the financial crisis is an apples-to-oranges comparison as the global economy was in tatters and demand all but gone. With estimates having come down significantly in the last few months, along with the share price move, we think the long-term risk-reward looks extremely favorable. But we analyzed past periods of troughs in the cycles and even accounting for missing the absolute nadir, they typically can produce outsized gains in the shares over the subsequent two to four years. The chart below shows estimates for fiscal 2016 estimates in concert with the share price. We think this is due to analysts extrapolating near-term negative conditions too far into the future. If you go back to 2012 and 2013, we would see the opposite effect of the above chart. The sell-side simply isn't accounting for the cyclicality within the underlying businesses. The 2012 is below: We think the shares are setting up for another run over the next two years as maximum pessimism are embedded into the shares and the Street incorporates depressed end-markets too far into the future. We see the 2016 and especially 2017 forecasts as likely far too low and that estimates, which rose nearly 16% in 2013 and saw the share price jump 30%, are likely to rise from here. The drivers for those higher estimates are the factors we described above including better infrastructure spending, a highway funding bill, better commodity prices, and the US dollar reverting to the mean. The company is making all the right moves during a cyclical downturn by reducing costs and improving efficiencies. We think their peak operating margins can hit at least 18.5%, up 190 bps from the 2013 peak with additional upside possibility to that figure. As we noted, during the last peak-to-peak cycle, operating margins improved 80 bps without any restructuring. We believe that with a restructuring plan, they should be able to at least double that improvement. If we think the next peak will occur in 2017 or 2018, we can foresee the shares hitting $170-$180 by the end of next year using fairly reasonable assumptions. The peak EV/EBITDA multiple was 10.0x in 2013, so we used the same multiple for this upcoming cyclical peak. Shares of Valmont are offering a value-play on rising infrastructure spending across various end-markets. The shares are overly depressed as the sell-side uses time series forecasting and embeds far too low estimates for 2016 and 2017. This is setting up the company for easy beats and likely to reverse the trend of lower estimates, pushing up the share price. Meanwhile, the lower-cost footprint should allow the firm to realize much higher operating margins at the next cyclical peak, something we see zero accounting for from the Street.
