Fiscal 2015 was a great year for MGC Diagnostics. We achieved record top-line and bottom-line financial results for the fourth quarter and full year. I am extremely proud of the job the entire MGC team did in fiscal 2015. We delivered strong revenue growth for the year, we head into the New Year with a solid backlog in our Medical Graphics business, we have better positioned Medisoft for improved financial performance in the upcoming years and the financial foundation now the company has is as strong as it has been in years. Wes will discuss our financial results in more detail a little later in the call, but here are some of the highlights. Our Medical Graphics subsidiary experienced one of its best operating quarters by posting revenue of $9.2 million and 9.6% increased over last year's fourth quarter. Operating income was $1 million compared to an operating income of $501,000 for the same period last year. Medical Graphics fourth quarter revenue results included 29 competitive conversions that contributed $1.6 million in revenue, the best quarter since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. Our new repackaged Ultima Series system launched at the end of fiscal 2015 second quarter continues to gain traction in the market. During the fourth quarter, we sold 19 systems totaling $616,000 in revenue. We are excited about the future prospects of this system as more customers are introduced to it. During the quarter Medical Graphics entered into a strategic partnership with Pacificâ€?Medico, the seller of CCM Express product in the Japanese market, which resulted in $328,000 in fourth-quarter sales. This is our first step towards opening this market for our other products. Medical Graphics fiscal 2015 results were just as impressive with revenue of $32 million, 11.6% increase over fiscal 2014 and our best revenue results since 2007. Operating income was $2.7 million, the most profitable year on record compared to an operating loss of $215,000 for fiscal 2014. For the year, Medical Graphics won a total of 66 competitive conversions that contributed $3 million in revenue, compared to 48 competitive conversions and $2.9 million in revenue for fiscal 2014. Medical Graphics finished fiscal year 2015 with a sales backlog of $2.3 million, the best result going into New Year since 2007. Medisoft's revenue for the fourth quarter remained consistent, with the prior two sequential quarters at $1.4 million and gross margin improved to 42.6%, their best quarter result of the year. Medisoft's operating expenses trended higher for the quarter, resulted in operating loss of $145,000. Despite this negative result, Medisoft is much more stable today than it was earlier in the year. We continue to make progress on transforming Medisoft into a growing and profitable business and we expect much better performance during fiscal 2016. It is definitely gratifying to have completed one of the best years the company as had in quite some time. The results could not have been accomplished without the dedication and hard work of all of our employees. I am particularly proud of the performance of our selling team and their contribution to our success in fiscal 2015. Heading into the first quarter of the New Year, we have a strong backlog, positive sales momentum and a growing opportunity pipeline. Our objectives for this year will remain the same as last year, grow the top-line generate consistent quarter-over-quarter results and enhanced profitability. I believe the company is poised to accomplish these objectives and I look forward to returning in early March to report on our first-quarter results. Thank you, Todd. For the fourth quarter, we reported consolidated revenue of $10.6 million, an increase of 9.3% from last year's fourth-quarter revenue of $9.7million. Medical Graphics contributed $9.2 million for the quarter compared to $8.4 million for the same period last year, a 9.6% increase. Medisoft contributed $1.4 million for the quarter compared to $1.3 million for the same period last year, a 6.9% increase. Consolidated equipment and accessories revenue increased 13.9% in the quarter to $7 million from $6.2 million in a year ago period, with Medical Graphics and Medisoft contributing $5.6 million and $1.4 million, respectively. For the quarter, equipment and accessories revenues for Medical Graphics and Medisoft increased 15.8% and 6.9%, respectively compared to last year. Domestic fourth quarter equipment and accessories revenues increase 15% to $4.6 million from $4 million in the 2014 fourth quarter, with Medical Graphics and Medisoft contributing $4.4 million and $231,000, respectively. During the quarter, Medical Graphics competitive account conversions totaled 29 accounts or $1.6 million in revenue, our best result since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 compared to 12 accounts or $729,000 in revenue for the same quarter last year. International equipment and accessories revenue grew 12% to $2.4 million from $2.1 million for the last year's fourth quarter. For the quarter, Medical Graphics and Medisoft contributed $1.3 million and $1.1 million, respectively. Supplies revenue, which was entirely generated by Medical Graphics, decreased 0.6% to $1.69 million compared to $1.7 million during the prior year quarter. Domestic supplies revenue fell 1.5% and international supplies revenue increased 3.4% for the quarter. Service revenue, which was entirely generated by Medical Graphics, increased 2.4% to $1.82 million in the quarter from $1.78 million during the prior year period.

For the quarter, Medical Graphics' domestic and international revenues split was 83% and 17% of total revenue, respectively, including Medisoft the consolidated domestic and international revenue split was 74% and 26%. Finally, our sales backlog at the end of the fourth quarter totaled $2.6 million, a $700,000 increase compared to the backlog of $1.9 million at the end of fiscal 2014. Of the total backlog, Medical Graphics contributed $2.3 million, our best results since 2007 and Medisoft was $293,000. Moving down the income statement, consolidated gross margin for the quarter was 52.4% compared to 52.9% for the same period last year. For the quarter, Medical Graphics gross margins was 53.8%, a 280-basis point decrease compared to last year's fourth quarter. Medisoft gross margin was 42.6% for the quarter, its best quarterly result this year compared to gross margin of 28.7% for last year's fourth quarter. Consolidated gross margin for equipment, supplies and accessories was 48.8% for the quarter compared to 49.1% for the same period last year. For the quarter, Medical Graphics and Medisoft gross margin for equipment, supplies and accessories was 50% and 42.6%, respectively. Gross margin for services was 69.3% for the quarter compared to 69.3% for the same period last year. Regarding operating expenses, fourth quarter consolidated sales and marketing expenses were $2.5 million or 23.4% of revenue compared to $2.6 million or 27.1% of revenue in the year ago period. This decrease was due to lower Medisoft sales and marketing expenses of $273,000, partially offset by higher Medical Graphics sales and marketing expenses of $130,000. Fourth quarter consolidated general and administrative expenses totaled $1.4 million or 13.4% of revenue compared to $1.7 million or 17.8% of revenue in the same quarter last year. This decrease is due to lower Medical Graphics' general and administrative expenses of $350,000 partially offset by higher Medisoft general and administrative expenses of $44,000. Fourth quarter consolidated research and development expenses were $693,000 or 6.6% of revenue in the fiscal 2015 fourth quarter, down from $791,000 or 8.2% of revenue in last year's fourth quarter. This decrease is primarily due to lower Medical Graphics' research and development expenses of $116,000, partially offset by higher Medisoft research and development expenses of $18,000. For the quarter, capitalized software development cost was $209,000 compared to $190,000 in the year ago period. For the fourth quarter, we had consolidated operating income of $883,000 compared to an operating loss of $95,000 for the same period last year. For the quarter, Medical Graphics had operating income of $1 million and Medisoft had an operating loss of $145,000. For the quarter, we had consolidated net income of $1 million or $0.24 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $336,000 or a loss of $0.08 per diluted share in the prior year period. For the quarter, Medical Graphics contributed net income of $1 million and Medisoft contributed to net loss of $56,000. For all of fiscal of 2015, we reported the consolidated tax benefit of $3.5 million resulting in consolidated net income of $4 million or $0.94 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $1.2 million or a loss of $0.28 per diluted share for fiscal 2014. For the year, Medical Graphics contributed net income of $5 million and Medisoft contributed a net loss of $1 million. Of the $0.94 per diluted share for fiscal 2015, the domestic and foreign tax provisions contributed approximately $0.71 and $0.13 per diluted share, respectively. The acquisition of the Medisoft increased the company's exposure to currency translation risk regarding its investment in euro-denominated assets and the earnings derived from Medisoft's operations. In the 2015 fourth quarter, due to the United States dollar losing strength against the euro, we reported a non-cash foreign currency translation gain of $29,000 and the consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss as foreign currency gain. Additionally, pertaining to the net asset position for assets and liabilities of Medisoft, we also incurred the non-cash foreign currency translation loss of $27,000, which is included in the consolidated balance sheet as accumulated other comprehensive loss and in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss as other comprehensive loss. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents were $6.6 million at year-end compared to $5.7 million at the end of fiscal 2014. We also had positive working capital of $11.4 million at year-end and a $1.5 million-improvement over working capital of $9.9 million at the end of fiscal 2014. For the year, we generated cash of $2.2 million from operating activities compared to $342,000 generated in the same period last year. We used approximately $480,000 in investing activities for the year compared to $8.9 million used in the same period last year, most of which was attributed to the Medisoft acquisition. During the year, $679,000 of cash was used in financing activities, which was primarily due to $800,000 in loan payments compared to cash provided by financing activities of $3.7 million for the same period last year, which included $4 million of loan proceeds to finance the Medisoft acquisition. In our earnings release, we disclosed that the company entered into a distribution agreement in March 2014 under which we agreed to purchase and distribute sleep diagnostic products for a third-party manufacturer. In December 2015, we informed the manufacturer that we are rescinding that distribution agreement, because it violates specific statutory requirements that are unrelated to product safety or performance. As of October 31, 2015, our inventory balance included approximately $450,000 of inventory that we had previously purchased from the manufacture. Rescission of the distribution agreement requires the manufacturer to repurchase this inventory. As an alternative to this repurchase, we have offered to enter into a wind-down agreement, under which we would have the right to sell this inventory. The manufacturer has not yet responded to our notice of rescission. As of October 31, 2015, we have not recognized any impairment of this inventory, because we believe the manufacturer will either repurchased the inventory or will allow us to sell this inventory. If we are unable to successfully resolve this matter, we may determine that some, or all of the sleep diagnostics inventory is impaired and we would then incur an impairment charge against this inventory. Finally, during our fiscal 2015 third quarter conference call, we disclosed that we notified the Medisoft selling shareholders of our monetary claim against them for the violation of representations and warranties contained in the stock purchase agreement. We attempted to resolve our claim with the selling shareholders through negotiations, but we were unable to do so and the claim remains unresolved. As a result, we have commenced litigation against the selling shareholders to resolve the claim in Belgium court. This process may take some time, but there is always a possibility we may settle the claim before the court proceedings concludes. We will update this matter in our SEC filings as new information becomes available. With that, I will turn the call over to Matt to provide an update on our global sales and marketing initiatives. Matt? Hey. Thanks, Wes. I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate my sales team and the entire organization for the outstanding performance last year. I have had the pleasure to lead the sales, service and support teams for three years now and they are the best in the industry. I fully expect that they will perform at the same high level during fiscal 2016. For 2016, our sales plan will be guided by several initiatives that are designed around growing our revenue on a consistent basis. We have the largest backlog the company has seen in quite some time and we continue to manage robust pipeline of sales opportunities. However, one of our primary business objectives is to enhance shareholder value and one of the best ways to accomplish this objective is to grow revenue over what we accomplished during our fiscal 2015. To that end, we are investing resources to develop the partnership with the leading telesales firm to help us grow our domestic sales pipeline. The primary goals of telesales initiative is to call unknown pulmonary diagnostic sites that are not Medical Graphics customers to gather information and generate leads for the selling team. I have worked with this firm in the past and they are completely focused on helping their clients generate better revenue results. We are excited about this partnership and I look forward to providing future updates on the results of this new program. As Todd mentioned previously, sales of our redesigned Ultima Series system that we launched last year have been exceeding our expectations. During the quarter, we had the opportunity to showcase the Ultima Series at several major tradeshows and the feedback was very positive. Some of the comments we received is nice to see an emphasis on future products. The Ultima is by far the most complete product in the market and capable of performing complete line of cardiorespiratory procedures and the Ultima is truly the most flexible PFT system in the industry. These comments in our initial feedback from six months of installations validate the successful launch and the quality of our manufacturing team. During our last call, I mentioned that we are seeing increased activity in our clinical trials business. We recently signed two new contracts to service clinical research organizations and just recently got our first order. These volumes are not expected to be too large in fiscal 2016, but do offer a lot of future potential. Looking at the international side of the business, we are very pleased with the 2015 revenue growth from a Medical Graphic, international markets. For the fourth quarter, revenue grew 35% to $1.6 million from $1.2 million for the same period last year. This growth is primarily attributed to robust sales activity in our European and Asia-Pacific markets. During the quarter, our European FOT distribution partner sold 20 systems and we are very happy to see this product getting more traction in the European market and we expect better results in the future. For the year international revenue for Medical Graphics grew 13.2% to $5.7 million from $5 million in fiscal 2014. Again, this annual growth was produced through our European and Asia-Pacific markets. Regarding the recent partnership that we announced with Pacificâ€?Medico to enter Japanese market, Pacificâ€?Medico has done multiple demos and tradeshows during the past few months. We are expecting more orders in FY'16. Feedback from these marketing activities has been very positive and the CCM Express is well-placed to service the intensive care market in Japan. Regarding Medisoft, we continued to perform as expected and worked the plan we put in place last year to improve our sales, service and quality. Our key initiative for this year is to gain back competitive market share in our direct markets and expand our distribution presence. Lastly, we continue to expand into new international markets during the next several months for both, Medical Graphics and Medisoft, and we will keep you updated as these initiatives progress. With that, I will turn the call back over Todd, before we commence the Q&A session. Todd, back to you. Thank you, Matt. Fiscal 2015 was much improved compared to fiscal 2014. We are very pleased with our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2015 results. Our Medical Graphics subsidiary experienced one of its best periods in the company's history and we continue to make progress transforming Medisoft into a growing and profitable business. We have a better understanding of the global market conditions and a working strategy that positions our products and services to meet customer and global business partner needs. Our updated Ultima Series continues to provide an upgraded pathway for our loyal MGC installed base as well as an attractive alternative to new customers as they change brands. The integration of Medisoft continues to progress in a positive direction, with the appointment of Frederick Gavage as Managing Director, we now have in place a strong team prepared to strengthen the Medisoft brand. We are confident that Medisoft provides a significant step in our strategy to become a leading global supplier of cardiorespiratory diagnostic solutions. As we reflect on the past fiscal year, everyone at MGC Diagnostics is proud of the accomplishments and the results these efforts produced. Entering fiscal 2016 with the $2.3 million domestic sales backlog and a growing global sales pipeline, we have the confidence that our sales momentum will continue to drive improved financial performance. Our commitment to grow top-line revenue, bottom-line income and generate increasing shareholder value remains at the forefront of our global strategy and everyone at MGC Diagnostics is committed to achieving these objectives. We believe that our business model and strategy is lined to further enhance shareholder value and we look forward to the year ahead. We want to thank our shareholders for their continued support and look forward to updating you in the upcoming quarters. With that, let us turn the call over to the conference operator to commence the question and answer session. Amy? Good afternoon, gentlemen, and congrats on all the progress. I have two questions. Question number one is, Wes, probably for you. I did not hear anything about the positive impacts of the temporary elimination of medical device tax. Can you give us some ballpark number about what the benefit will be to MGC for this fiscal year and Todd maybe you can comment on how you might be using that benefit that you are going to be getting? Yes. Larry, this is Wes. In fiscal '15, we paid roughly or expensed roughly $190,000 in tax. Well, that is going to be the benefit moving forward. Yup, I think, you know, we view this recession of the tax like most of the medical device industry as a benefit, but yet to understand that it is just a two-year rescission and the future still uncertain as this kind of unfolds. We have earmarked those additional funds for primarily revenue-generating activities aligned with some of the strategies that Matt outlined in our telesales initiatives. Okay. Then, Todd, you and I have had conversations from time-to-time over the last year about investor relations and you have not been out on the road as far as I know for quite some time. I am wondering now with the end of the fiscal year very strong performance and what appears to be a very promising fiscal '16, if you think you will be getting out and talking up the story a little bit more. Yes, very much, Larry. In partnership with Lytham Partners, Wes and I and Matt will definitely have some scheduled events in the upcoming quarters and hope to get in front of our existing investors as well as potential future investors. Just something to add to that, Larry, this is Wes. Through the Board of Directors, we have the formally developed an investor relations committee inside the company that in addition to going on road shows throughout the year, we are going to be more actively involved in communicating and making contact with the investment community. Yes. Hi, guys. Very, very nice report, congratulations, glad to see the progress. I do have a few questions as always. Todd or Wes, what did you say the operating loss was from Medisoft in the quarter? I can't find that quarterly number in the press release. Maybe I missed it. Okay. A couple questions about that. One is just the math and maybe I am doing it wrong. When I was listening to you guys and waiting to get a number, I added about from the first three quarters and it was $532,000, $284,000, $90,000, which was $906,000, so it is not a big deal, but it would have put it at a little over $200,000. Did I do something wrong there or did something had retroactively changed? How did that happen? I do not believe so. I mean, it will sound like the correct operating losses for Q1, Q2 and Q3, - and the total operating loss for FY'15 was $1 million. Yes. I think I mentioned $1 million. Yes. In my remarks, Mark, I mentioned $1 million operating loss for all of FY'15. Okay. Yeah. I apologize. That is fine. Yes. In fact, it is lower than what you said, according to this. It is $94,000. That is good and I apologize for that. It was my mistake. You had talked about Medisoft. I saw it maybe being breakeven this quarter and obviously $100,000 is not a big swing, but how do you get to breakeven. I guess that tags into my other question that is, have you had some progress on expanding European distribution for those guys. You were talking about you know if you could just nail one or two big distributors, it would make a huge difference. Yes. Hey, Mark. It is Todd. The biggest impact has been some of the changes in the gross margin of product and the overall operating expenses that we have managed out f the Medisoft business. We are actively entertaining new business partners. Matt and I attend a number of international tradeshows in the European market and have been approached more frequently and no more earnestly by some of those business partners that carry competitive products there in the past and we are putting efforts into Medisoft direct markets, which is primarily Belgium and France and trying to increase our higher-margin direct sales channels into those two markets while we try to entertain and convert business partners around the world. Okay, so it is a plan in progress. All right, last question. How much of this quarter's strength was seasonal for both companies? While Medisoft does not seem to have it at all, obviously, it was hugely your strongest quarter but yet last quarter you said you were going to try to smooth that out and not have such a high stack [ph], so I guess what I am asking is how much of this quarter can we read into next quarter and Q2? Hey, Mark. It is Matt. Like always with our Q4, we always seem to ramp up and get some increased sales. As we mentioned in the comments, where we came out of Q4 not only achieving and exceeding expectations, but we came out with a really strong backlog, so we anticipate with the sales pipeline that we have, with the backlog that we have and the momentum that we will continue to see results and growth over prior year, which was really the main goal for this year as I announced it in my opening comments too. Yes. I would also like to say congratulations guys. What a great, especially fourth quarter too, a very nice year. That is really great to see. Going back to Mark's question, on your Medisoft distribution, have you made any progress with getting some of these reps from these other - that are representing a competitor product in some of these European countries? I think you have said in the past that you are hoping to land one or two of them. Any success yet? Hey, Ross. It is Matt. We have had some minor success in the smaller countries, but really those are bigger ones that we are targeting. We have not had the success that we anticipated. As Todd had mentioned, we just recently over the past several months been approached little bit more and I think some of that is the flux in the marketplace too and some of the uncertainty with some of our competitors as well as the distribution business partners we are seeing the improved service and improved momentum that we had, so we are anticipating that we should be able to get some of those folks to move over during this year, but as both, Todd and myself have mentioned, really we figure if we can get in to those direct markets where we just have not paid a whole lot of attention up until now, if we can get some traction going there that's a little bit easier when working through some of the of the business partners, so change in direction just a little bit, but certainly we feel we can get a couple of those. We can see some pretty quick momentum pick up. Okay. Yes. Good luck with that, because I know the Medisoft so far has not paid off, but it sounds like it certainly could now starting this year. Is that a fair statement? Okay. Then, so this line about your distribution agreement that you rescinded with the third-party manufacturer it said you rescinded the distribution agreement, because it violates specific statutory requirements that are unrelated the product safety or performance, so what does it relates to? Ross, this is Wes. At this point, because we are in this particular situation, where we are not at liberty to divulge any details regarding the rescission that we made. Okay. I guess the other couple of questions that I had were answered, so congrats again guys. Thanks very much. At this time, we have no further questions, and I would like to turn the conference back over to Todd Austin for closing remarks. Thank you for participating on today's call. We look forward to talking with you again as we report our fiscal 2016 first-quarter results. Have a great day. The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.
