Fiscal 2016 began with very strong revenue growth, closing of an attractive acquisition following the close of first quarter, and we finished September with a strong and higher margin backlog. The revenue growth this quarter was driven our ongoing Dover Air Force project. As we’ve noted previously, at over $98 million, this is a strategically important project for us, as we continue to broaden our portfolio capabilities. Because Dover is a construction project and we are the prime contractor, we subcontract much of the work adding a minor fee. As a result, our Dover contract contributes lower margin revenues as compare to the balance of work and during the quarter we saw the anticipated impact on overall gross margin performance. During the first quarter of our fiscal year, we are focused on bid and proposal activity as the U.S. government ended fiscal year. Due to such seasonality, our first quarter is typically our least profitable one. Additionally, during our first quarter we posted non-reoccurring expenses related to our acquisition of Johnson Controls Security Systems or JCSS. The acquisition closed just after the end of the quarter and is now operating as Versar Security Systems or VSS. This is an excellent acquisition for us, bringing new, higher margin, classified construction capabilities. We believe that our marketplace advantage lies in our ability to broaden and strengthen our portfolio of solutions and we expect to generate higher margins as we integrate VSS and grow this business. We remain focused on managing our expenses. And while SG&A on an absolute dollar basis was relatively flat this quarter, as a percentage of sales, SG&A expense decline to 6% as compared to 9% in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. In addition to executing our core business over the past several years, we have strategically acquired businesses that have allowed us to enhance our portfolio of capabilities and product offerings. Our strength and ability to deliver customizable solutions has resulted in more contracts won, a growing pipeline of opportunities in both the government and private sectors and significant backlog growth. As of October 1, 2015, our funded backlog was $225 million, a 26% increase compared to the funded backlog of $179 million at June 26, 2015. Our quarter closed on September 25, 2015 while significant contract activity was ongoing. So, always we provide our October 1st backlog because it includes funded awards received during the last five days of the government’s fiscal year. And additionally, the October 1st backlog this year includes projects from JCSS acquisition. During the first quarter, our SATOC joint venture with Johnson Controls Federal Systems was awarded $2.5 million contract from the Air Force Civil Engineer Center to provide construction services at Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho. Additionally, this week, we announced two new task orders with a combined value of $17 million from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Middle East district under our existing personal services contract in Afghanistan. With working capital of $22.6 million, we continue to prudently manage our balance sheet. Subsequent to the close of the quarter, we entered into a new credit facility with Bank of America that has both a term and a revolver components. This improvement to our debt and financing structure will allow us effectively manage our ongoing liquidity needs. I will now turn it over to our Executive Vice President and CFO, Cynthia Downes, to review our financial results for the first quarter of 2016. Thank you, Tony. Gross revenue for first quarter of fiscal 2016 grew 52% to $44.9 million as compared to $29.6 million in first quarter of fiscal 2015. The revenue increase was primarily related to our Dover Air Force base project. Gross margins for the first quarter of 2016 were 5% compared to 9% in the prior year. The margin decrease is primarily due to revenue mix related to lower margin we got from Dover project. Purchase service and materials for the first quarter increased significantly to $29.8 million, again as a result of our higher project costs primarily related to Dover. Direct costs of services and overhead decreased approximately 13% or $1.9 million related to our realignment within ESG and realized contract cost savings across all of our business segments. SG&A expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 increased to $2.9 million as compared to $2.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. Included in this number was approximately $200,000 of one-time expenses related to Company’s acquisition of JCSS. Additionally, as commented on earlier, as a percentage of sales, SG&A decreased to 6% of sales compared to 9% of sales in the first quarter of last year. The Company recorded an operating loss of $552,000 for the first quarter fiscal year 2016 compared to operating loss of 85,000 in the first quarter of the same prior fiscal year. Net loss in the quarter of 2016 was $431,000 or loss $0.04 per share as compared to a net loss of same quarter last year of 89,000 or loss of $0.01 per share. Net loss in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 included the $200,000 in one-time expenses related the Company’s acquisition of JCSS, mentioned earlier. Now focusing on operating results of our business segments for the first quarter of 2016. Engineering and construction management: In the first quarter of fiscal 2016, gross revenue was $13 million, an increase of a 130% compared to the first quarter of last year. This increase primarily resulted from a $18.5 million revenue from the Dover project offset by decreases in revenues from Title II work in Afghanistan and decreased revenue contribution from our PPS subsidiary in the UK. While we expect our Title 2 work for the U.S. Air Force to be completed in fiscal 2016, we continue to perform work on our personal services contract, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in Afghanistan. First quarter margin in the segment was 4% compared to 12% last year. Margin decline in the segment because the majority of revenue contribution projects were some of the lower margin work in Dover project. Environmental services: First quarter revenue was relatively flat at $10 million compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2015. Gross profit for the segment was $665,000, an increase of more than 100% as compared to gross profit in first quarter of fiscal 2015. Gross margin in the segment was 7% compared to 3% last year. As the recent higher margin contract wins begin to ramp up in the second quarter, we expect to keep profit improvement. Gross revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 was $4.8 million, a decrease of 23% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2015. The Company continued to see a decline in contract positions to the shift towards more contracts towards to companies that qualify for small business program. The Company is focusing on strategies to partner with the small business, as currently transitioning from a prime contractor role to a subcontractor role on several of its recently [indiscernible] Army installations. Gross margin for the segment in the first quarter was 8% compared to 12% last year. The decrease is a result of the decline in revenue due to a loss of task orders and associated direct labor as detailed above. Thank you, Cynthia. Let me just clarify something. Those last two paragraphs were associated with our professional services group, not our environmental services group. So from a revenue standpoint, we had a solid start to fiscal 2016. We believe that our broadened capabilities and prudent reputation providing customized solutions in difficult terrains and challenging locations position us as well to meet the needs of our existing customers to more effectively compete for new contracts. As both our recently won organic growth with higher margins and VSS gained traction, we expect to see improved margins and a return to profitability as we move further into fiscal 2016. I want to thank you all for your continued support. And as a reminder, please consider joining us for our Annual Shareholder Meeting which will be next Tuesday, November 10th, at 10 am at the Springfield Golf and Country Club, in Springfield Virginia. Thanks tony. I’d like to ask the operator to give the instructions for asking questions to the callers on the line. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now be conducting a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steve Rudd from Blackwall. [Ph] Please go ahead with your question. Hi, a few questions. First on the -- those last two paragraphs, basically it sounds like the position is something in subcontractor, because [indiscernible] professional services enable us to get more work, is that about right? It is. We’re still competing in a number of areas at the prime and winning, but a number of – they are old contracts or coming up -- they are coming up as small business. And so we are having to identify partners that are small businesses that we can team with. We obviously would have the history and the reputation on the project, but they’re small business. So, a good example is Joint Base Lewis-McCord where we had the team and to slip the work. Okay, I got it. And we’ll somehow be able to maintain good margins nonetheless with a bit of share… Exactly. We saw a slight decline in margin, there is no question, but we don’t have a very heavy overhead structure to run professional services group. So, the decline has hit margin a little bit because we’re spreading our indirect a little less but we continue to look ways to take cost out and we continue to chase new opportunities, both as a primes and as sub. Second is we all worked for this new quarter [ph] and we got backlog. It’s little confusing that gap on the backlog 2015 [ph] to basically today, because I had thought that you guys were going to be announcing large awards as they came in. And the only one that I started unless I got wrong is the 17 million, but I could be wrong. You’re not wrong. And I understand that. The issue of course is a couple of fold on announcing. One, every now and then -- not every now then. We do have certainly clients that ask us not to announce awards and so we have to respect that. And so we announced what we can announce. The other thing is that it takes time. We actually have to draft the announcement. We typically then have to run it by the client who many times have to run it up to their legal department. It has to run back down. And so quite often you can see a significant delay. Every now and then we get surprise where the government actually announces it very quickly like they did on the FRR contract to IDIQ when that happened earlier in September. And actually they announced it immediately as they sent us the notice, which surprised us. But by and large, there could be a multiple-week to over a month long delay between winning the award and announcing it as an example was. I mean we won that the personal services contract award; it’s came in right at the end of September and here we are in early November before we finally got client approval. So it’s a mix of things. We announce when we can. And we typically have a rule of thumb of kind of $1 million or more that we will announce or if it ‘s something strategically new. But of if our clients says, we don’t want this out, so, we have to respect that. And third is now we’re back to a very solid margins like we saw in the prior quarter as opposed to this weakened margin state that we just went through? Dover was 40%, 47% of our revenue this quarter. We knew this was going to happen, we knew that winning Dover was a double-edged sword. It’s a major project, high profile, certainly helps us to prove our credentials. But we also knew it was very tight margin. And so we knew there was going to be a quarter coming when it was going to be a disproportionate share of our revenue. And it happened probably in the worst quarter possible because it’s also our weakest quarter normally because we’re doing so much bidding proposals and then on top of that obviously we had some acquisition costs. That said, we are starting to see some of the wins that we have ramping back up. Dover will not be as heavy a piece of it for two reasons as we’re going into a slightly slower time for Dover plus we have other things ramping up. So, we do expect to see the improved margins coming through. We think we have our SG&A costs under control. We will probably have a few some more dollars rolling through on VSS just in terms because we close the transaction beginning of October and there are other fees that will come through of course, bank fees et cetera. But at the same time, we will now have the VSS revenue and the VSS profitability flowing through as well. And I was -- was only a few 100 shares, so what what’s up with the -- I’d say you sold some shares, what was up with that? That was some restricted stock coming vested and they have to take -- our general policy here is that they sell some shares basically in the market to cover the tax obligation. So basically now we’ve got ramping up top line, given the improving bottom line and a bit of growth, a significant growth because of acquisition with additionally high margin. Is that about right? Exactly. Yes. We don’t provide guidance but I guess my assessment is we are actually more optimistic about this year than we were last. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Ellis from L Street Capital. Please go ahead with your question. One question on -- in environmental services, do you see kind of in the Q4 of last year kind of 15% margin, dropped to7% margin this quarter, which was kind of more at the historical levels, but you had said at the end of Q4 that you might be able to hang on to that kind of newer level of profitability. So, going forward, the rest of the year, which one do you see as being kind of closer to which you might realize the kind of this most recent quarter or last quarter? I think we expect, last quarter was interesting quarter because we have some projects that are milestones driven and we had a nice project kind of hit and it bumped us a little. But we see margins moving north of this quarter. I don’t think we will get back to the fourth quarter, but we’re definitely going to see continued improvement and sustain and being able to maintain those margins within that group. The restructuring has had a dramatic effect on the indirect cost structure which obviously has had the same effect on the margins. So, are we going to get in the double digits? It will be close, if not there but we’re certainly going to see but we’re certainly going to see continued improvement in margin. And then one more question on the acquisition that closed, have you announced how much of -- with the funded backlog, I mean I guess, because -- are you able to disclose how much that was that kind of bumped up the number on in October? Yes, we hadn’t disclosed it. What I would say is that from the end of the fiscal year -- at the end of the quarter, I’m sorry, where we were at about 157 and we ended up at 225. It’s approximately 50-50, 50% of that came through organic growth and 50% or so came through the acquisition. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have no further questions in queue at this time. I’d like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments. Thanks to everyone. We’ll be posting broadcast to the website in the next couple of hours, if anyone that would like to access it. And we’ll be releasing our Q2 2016 results in February. And as always, we’ll continue to announce our wins and our awards as they occur. Lastly, thank you for your continued support of Versar. And we’ll look forward to talking with you again soon.
