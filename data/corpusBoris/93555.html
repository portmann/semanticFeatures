Understanding Canadian Dollar Weakness | Seeking Alpha The Canadian dollar remains weak as both consumer spending and inflation decline, weighing on monetary policy. The Canadian currency is represented by CurrencyShares Canadian Dollar Trust (NYSEARCA: FXC ). In April, the retail sales figure came in at an annual pace of 1.7%, below the previous month's reading of 3.1%, while also missing estimates for 2.8%. Since peaking at over 5.0% in early 2014, consumer spending has steadily declined, seen below. Economic uncertainty has led to lower consumer sentiment , pushing spending down. "Consumer spending had stalled in the first quarter, reflecting not only uncertainty related to the oil-price swoon but also bad weather. Economists, though, had forecast a rebound in consumer spending in the second quarter, in part on higher after-tax income," according to the Wall Street Journal. On top of falling consumer spending, inflation pressures are also weakening. In May, the inflation figure came in at an annual pace of 0.9%, above the previous month's reading of 0.8%, while also exceeding estimates for 0.8%. After reaching over 2.0% growth in early 2014, the inflation measure has fallen to current levels, seen below. Energy costs continue to weigh the most on inflation. In contrast, prices for the purchase of passenger vehicles increased 1.8 percent. The energy index decreased 11.8 percent, led by gasoline prices (-17.4 percent)," according to Trading Economics. Finally, with both weak inflation and consumer spending, the key lending rate will likely stay at suppressed levels. In May, the key lending rate was held at 0.75%, unchanged from the previous month, and in line with estimates. Due to economic weakness in early 2015, the lending rate was cut 25 basis points from 1.0%, to current levels, seen below. Analysts believe that economic activity will likely remain weak in coming quarters as well, deterring policymakers from tightening conditions. "Overall, the weak retail sales will likely combine with a disappointing manufacturing report to weigh down the Canadian economy in April. That is likely to concern the Bank of Canada, which is looking for a rebound in the second quarter following the dismal Q1 indicators," according to the Financial Post. The Canadian economy remains in uncertain territory. Consumer spending is falling, alongside weakening inflation pressures. Policymakers will likely keep monetary conditions loose as economic activity underperforms. Low rates should weigh on the Canadian dollar, pushing it lower in coming months.
