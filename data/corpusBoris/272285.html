While Subway and McDonald’s held back on ad spending earlier in the year, others were shelling out more significantly increased their ad budget during the third quarter of the year. For example, Denny’s increased ad spending by 46% and IHOP increased spending 25% while waiting for the introduction of all-day breakfast. “Their amplified marketing support appears to be a reaction to higher breakfast spending from several QSR chains and the anticipation of McDonald’s launch of an all-day breakfast menu,?? Kantar Media said in an analysis of ad spending. Despite IHOP and Denny’s spending more for ads in the third quarter, overall ad-spending was down 2.5% during that time. Still, Kanter anticipates that fourth quarter spending – which took place during McDonald’s rollout of its new menu – will likely be record-setting. Much of that spending could be tied to other fast food establishments offering new menu items. Burger King will add a chicken burger sandwich, while Wendy’s is expected to unveil a Black Bean Burger.
