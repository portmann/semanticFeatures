GoPro: International Sales And Broadening Portfolio To Fuel Growth - GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) | Seeking Alpha Short Interest in GoPro declined dramatically between April and May as it reported strong fiscal first quarter results. The launch of HERO+LCD is further evidence that the company is constantly innovating. Sales growth in international markets has been impressive. GoPro (NASDAQ: GPRO ) shares had a very decent run last year following its IPO. This year, however, shares have been under pressure. The market was bracing for a sharp pullback. Indeed, there was a massive amount of short interest in GoPro. But after very positive fiscal first quarter results , shares recovered some of the earlier losses even as short positions declined considerably. In the first quarter, the company not only beat its own expectations but also topped Wall Street's forecasts. Revenue in the fiscal first quarter climbed 54% from the year-earlier quarter to $363.1 million-the second highest quarterly revenue in GoPro's history. Adjusted EBITDA rose 97.4% from the year-earlier quarter to $56.5 million. Besides, the quarter marked 1.3 million capture device shipments-a third successive quarter of above 1 million unit shipments. The number of shares shorted, which stood at 19.27 million shares as of 15 April 2015, declined to 13 million by mid-May. Shares received more support earlier this week after the photo and video capture device maker unveiled its easy-to-use touchscreen camera, HERO+LCD. While the model will hit GoPro authorized stores in the U.S. on June 6, its international availability will start from July 12. Reasonably priced at $300, HERO+LCD with its numerous features should see a favorable response from the market. That said, the photo capture device industry will always face one challenge. Increased usage of tablets and smartphones, having both capturing and video features, has made structural landscape more competitive. And, to grab market share, companies like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) have been constantly innovating and will continue to do so. Still, GoPro has done well on this front. It knows that to compete against photo-and-video enabled mobile devices and traditional cameras and camcorders, it will have to consistently offer differentiated capabilities. And that's why GoPro cameras have in-built Wi-Fi, select mounting accessories and protective waterproof housing among many other features. In addition, it has been steadily rolling-out its core HERO line of cameras. It launched its first HD version in 2009 and since then it has introduced HERO2 camera in 2011; HERO3 in 2012; HERO3+ in 2013; and, HERO4 in 2014. The consistent growth in revenue reflects the fact that unceasing innovation, research and development is yielding good results. In fiscal year 2014, GoPro posted revenue of $1,394.2 million, up from $985.7 million in fiscal 2013 and $526 million in 2012. Likewise, net income has also jumped to $128.1 million in fiscal 2014 from $60.6 million in fiscal 2013 and $32.3 million in fiscal 2012. The company now is increasingly focusing on international sales through its distribution channels. This should further bolster the top-line growth. Its fiscal first quarter results showed strong sales growth in international markets. Revenue from Europe, Middle East and Africa segment climbed to $139.1 million in the fiscal first quarter from $84.1 million, year-over-year. Revenue from Asia-Pacific region rose to $43.9 million up from $26.4 million, year-over-year. In addition, GoPro also has a very sound business strategy. Right now, bulk of the revenue is generated from its capture device business. However, in order to lessen its exposure to just one product and increase revenue streams, it is broadening its portfolio with focus on sharing solutions, content management and editing. GoPro recently acquired a French firm, Kolor, which is one of the leading names in virtual reality and spherical media solutions. It also teamed up with Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) for a virtual reality system. Moreover, it also intends to develop its own drones. GoPro is trading at nearly 75 times its earnings. That's way above the industry average. However, looking at the company's revenue and earnings growth, particularly in international markets, along with the focus on broadening its portfolio, I believe that there is further upside.
