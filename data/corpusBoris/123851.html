UPDATE 1-Brazil may cut spending further as tax revenue drops -Levy | Reuters BRASILIA, July 21 (Reuters) - Brazil may cut spending further to strengthen its finances due to a sharp drop in tax revenues, Finance Minister Joaquim Levy said on Tuesday without ruling out the possibility of lowering the government's key budget surplus target. With markets leery of the government adjusting its closely watched goal of a primary budget surplus of 1.1 percent of gross domestic product, Levy took a break from government talks on the matter to assure investors that austerity is here to stay even if the target is changed. The primary balance, or what the government saves before interest payments, is seen as an important gauge of its ability to repay its debt obligations. "The government is fully aware that a change to the target is not an end to the fiscal adjustment process," Levy said in a rare news briefing at the finance ministry. "Quite the opposite, it means you need to continue with the adjustment." A drop in tax revenues and political resistance to budget cuts have complicated President Dilma Rousseff's efforts to shore up the government's accounts and save Brazil's coveted investment-grade rating. Levy said the government is weighing whether it is the right time to review the 1.1 percent primary surplus target. A decision is expected by Wednesday, when the government releases its bi-monthly fiscal performance report. "That report will reflect our reality," Levy said. "I'm saying that the situation has changed, which means that we need to respond with vigor and realism." He said the government is considering making additional spending cuts above the 70 billion reais ($22.08 billion) announced earlier this year. He acknowledged there is room to make additional cuts in non-obligatory budget items. Despite a series of tax hikes and steep budget cuts, the government's fiscal results continue to disappoint. In the 12 months through May, the primary budget deficit narrowed to the equivalent of 0.68 percent of gross domestic product from a 0.76 percent deficit in the year ended in April.
