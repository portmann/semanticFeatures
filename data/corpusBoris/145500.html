5 Government Intermediate Bond Mutual Funds To Buy | Seeking Alpha Aug. 11, 2015  2:35 AM ET  |  Includes: DRGIX , FSTGX , HAUSX , MGIDX , VFITX by: Zacks Funds Mutual funds investing in government debt securities are among the most secure investment options which provide regular income while protecting capital invested. Funds which are part of this category bring a great deal of stability to portfolios with a large proportion of equity, while providing dividends more frequently than individual bonds. U.S. government bonds funds usually invest in Treasury bills, notes and securities issued by government agencies. They are considered to be the safest in the bond fund category and are ideal options for the risk-averse investor. Meanwhile, intermediate-term funds usually provide a safer option for investors, when compared to short-term funds. Fixed income securities having average maturity period between 3 and 10 years are classified as intermediate securities. These funds are believed to assure more stability and provide higher return than what short-term offer. Below we will share with you 5 buy-ranked government intermediate bond mutual funds. Each has earned either a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank #2 (Buy) as we expect these mutual funds to outperform their peers in the future.
