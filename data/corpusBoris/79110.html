Spending In Retirement Screencast | Seeking Alpha Jun.  7, 2015  3:25 AM ET by: Novel Investor Time for screencast #4. In today’s screencast I cover spending in retirement. I cover the three key aspects of spending in retirement; the level of post retirement spending relative to pre-retirement, the yearly increases to spending, and the impact of maintaining flexibility in spending during retirement. The combination of these three can create a powerful impact to how much you need to retire or conversely how much you can withdraw in retirement. I’ve covered these topics before on my blog.
