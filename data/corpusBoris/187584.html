Bulgaria expects fiscal surplus of 0.7 pct of GDP at end-September | Reuters SOFIA, Sept 30 Bulgaria expects a fiscal surplus of 0.7 percent of gross domestic product through September, compared with a deficit of 1.8 percent in the same period a year ago, the finance ministry said on Wednesday. Improved tax collection and European Union aid pushed the surplus to 0.7 percent of GDP through August, compared with a deficit of 1.6 percent in the same period a year ago, it said. That would put the Balkan country on track to meet its target for a fiscal deficit of 3 percent of GDP this year and help it further lower its deficit in 2016. The EU's poorest member state ended 2014 with a fiscal shortfall of 3.7 percent of GDP, partly due to political instability and the collapse of its fourth-largest lender, Corporate Commercial Bank. Government revenue in the first eight months of 2015 rose 11.8 percent from 2014 to 21.5 billion levs ($12.28 billion). Spending rose 1.8 percent to 20.9 billion, data showed. Fiscal reserves held under a currency regime pegging the lev to the euro stood at 11.1 billion levs at the end of August. Bulgaria has raised its 2015 forecast to 2.0 percent from a previous estimate of 1.4 percent. The central bank sees even faster acceleration of about 2.2 to 2.3 percent.
