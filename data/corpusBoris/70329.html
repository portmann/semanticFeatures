With that, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Shaw Hong. Shaw. Shaw Hong - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Anson. Welcome to all of you joining us on the call and webcast. Earlier this afternoon, we issued a press release describing our results for fiscal Q4, 2015. We reported fiscal Q4 revenues of $286 million, a decrease of 2% sequentially and 13.6% year-over-year. During the quarter, we shipped 180 million sensors. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margin was 22.7% and net income was $14 million or $0.22 per diluted share. Our cash and short-term investments increased slightly when compared to last quarter at approximately $524 million. These results were consistent with the fourth quarter revenue guidance that we provided in our last earning conference call. Before I discuss our business and long-term strategy, I would like to first comment on the definitive agreement that we have entered into with a consortium that consist of Hua Capital Management, CITIC Capital and GoldStone Investment. At the end of April, we announced the signing of a definitive agreement to be acquired by this consortium. Under the terms of the agreement, the consortium will acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of the company in cash at $29.75 per share or a total of approximately $1.9 billion. Our Board of Directors unanimously concluded that this arrangement is the best way to maximize value of our stockholders, providing them with immediate cash value for their investment. Furthermore, by partnering with the consortium and operating as a private company, we will have more flexibility to innovate and develop new solutions for our customers, which will benefit our employees, customers and business partners. We expect the transaction will close within the next nine to 12 months. However, the transaction is subject to approval by our stockholders, regulatory approvals including antitrust review in the U.S. and the People's Republic of China, review and the clearance by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., clearance or approval under applicable Taiwan law, and other customary closing conditions. As of today, we have not obtained all the necessary approval, nor have we met the closing conditions. As such, there's no assurance that the proposed acquisition by the consortium will close. With that said, I will now comment on our business and strategy. We are pleased that our Q4 financial results were consistent with our expectations, even though some of our target markets or regions were experiencing slower demand. Despite this near-term volatility, we believe we can continue to serve our customers well and achieve our long-term goal of profitable revenue growth by: first, developing cutting-edge technologies and delivering innovative products and applications; second, capitalizing on the fast-growing and diverse market opportunities; and third, continuing to work with our diversified supply chain to optimize cost and to ensure sufficient capacity to meet our customers' needs. First, developing and delivering innovative solutions. As I have discussed many times before, we believe in our technological strength, which is the foundation behind our entire product portfolio. In Q4, we achieved another exciting milestone in terms of technology development. We were able to shrink our pixel size down to 1 micron while maintaining the image sensor performance. Using this latest advance in technology development, we augmented our PureCel-S product line with a new 16-megapixel sensor. Once again, this demonstrates our engineering team's ability to prioritize our research results and turn them into practical solutions for our customers. We are also pushing our research efforts in other fronts to further diversify and broaden our product offerings. This includes ASICs, ISPs and our LCOS technologies. Our goal is to combine these complementary technologies with our sensors and offer our customers with the world's most comprehensive portfolio of imaging solutions. We believe our technological strength positions us well to meet our customers' needs across all of our target markets. In addition to our extensive R&D efforts, we are also continuing our efforts to form technology partnership, which we believe will accelerate the rate in which we can bring innovative solutions to our target market. Our recent partnership announcements are centered on product preference. By focusing on preference, we intend to meet our OEM customers' growing demand for turnkey solutions that can give them the ability to quickly and cost effectively bring innovative smart devices to their respective end markets, particularly in the area of security, smart homes and the Internet of Things. Next, capitalizing our fast-growing market opportunities. Our goal has always been to capitalize on new opportunities and expand our business in all our target markets. We see image sensors and image solutions continuing to proliferate as key components in the many consumer devices and applications. As such, we have lined up one of the broadest product portfolio in the world to meet our customers' need. For the global smartphone market, mobile phone is our largest target market, and we believe the significant opportunities in this market will ensure this vertical dominance in our near-term business portfolio. Over the past three years, we have been aggressively pursuing opportunity in emerging market such as China and India. Despite some near-term macroeconomic challenges, we expect the demand for smartphones in this emerging market, particularly in the mid-tier to entry-level smartphones, will continue its fast growth trajectory over the coming years. As such we are increasing our sales recourses in this market and we remain confident about our long-term prospect. Aside for the growth prospect, we are also benefiting indirectly when we put more emphasis on emerging markets, not only have we gained a broader customer base, we have also become more diversified geographically. As in any other businesses, such diversification in revenue source should help us develop a more stable and less volatile business in the long run. When other countries build out their wireless infrastructure and increase demand for mobile handset, we will make sure we'd be the first to move in to capture the sales opportunity. For the traditional markets such as entertainment and notebooks, due to a multitude of reasons, uncertainty in demand in this target market had led to a slower growth. And in the case of entertainment, we actually witnessed a decrease in demand. Their contributions to our overall business as a percentage of revenues have continued to decrease. However, we are excited about recent development in the wearable space. To capture potential upside, we are building up our product pipeline with our global shutter technology. For the market diversification into automotive and security, our worldwide automotive business is our new growth engine. We are growing our design win pipeline on a global scale and we are increasing our shipping volume quarter-to-quarter. With our experienced and advanced technologies, we have created products of choice for today's driver assistance cameras. We are also working hard with OEMs to develop the next generation of automotive sensors for machine vision oriented applications. Lane departure and road signs recognition are just the beginning. Our goal is to become one of the key technology enablers for driverless car in our not too distant future. Security is another target market that we are building up as potential growth engine. Earlier, I mentioned that we are forming technology partnerships to tackle the recent smart homes and Internet our Things phenomena. Together with our partners, we have lined up turnkey solutions for our OEM customers and we are in a great position to take advantage of growth opportunities in this market. Lastly, working with our diversified supply chain to optimize cost and to ensure sufficient capacity. This quarter's results speak for itself. We delivered yet another solid quarter with sequential gross margin improvement. One of our major initiatives in the past couple of years has been to diversify our supply chain, not only have we increased our overall capacity, thus giving us room for growth. We have also established a network of qualified suppliers with different pricing and technological capabilities, thus giving us the ability to produce a more balanced product portfolio that can compete more effectively in our many market segments. The net result is a 10-quarter streak of gross margin improvement. With that, I will now turn the call over to Ray, who will update you on our sales and marketing activities. Aurelio Cisneros - Senior VP-Worldwide Sales & Sales Operations Thank you, Shaw. We are pleased to report that our fiscal fourth quarter revenues were in line with our guidance. In our fourth fiscal quarter, we shipped 180 million units as compared to 198 million units in our prior quarter. The average selling price in our fourth quarter was $1.59 as compared to $1.46 in our prior quarter. The increase in ASP was attributed to the quarter-on-quarter increase in sensor shipments of higher resolution product mix, including 4-megapixel, 8-megapixel and 13-megapixel products. Unit sales of 8-megapixel and above represented approximately 19% of total shipments in the fiscal fourth quarter, compared to approximately 10% of total shipments in the prior quarter. Unit sales of the 3-megapixel to 5-megapixel category represented approximately 38% of total shipments, as compared to 41% in the prior quarter for the same category. Unit sales of 2-megapixel and below represented approximately 43% of total shipments, as compared to 49% in the prior quarter. In terms of target markets, our mobile phone sales represented approximately 69% of revenues in the fourth quarter, as compared to 67% in the prior quarter. Our automotive segment represented 9% of sales, as compared to 8% in our prior quarter. And our emerging market category sales, predominantly composed of the security market, represented 9% of sales, a slight increase from our prior quarter's 8%. Our entertainment segment represented 8% of sales, as compared to 12% in our prior quarter. Our sales of sensors into the notebook and webcam segment were approximately 5% of sales, equivalent to our prior quarter. In the mobile market, China, which is our largest regional segment, was roughly flat quarter-on-quarter. For the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we are seeing signs of recovery. In particular, we believe the China market is steadily transitioning to higher resolution segments for the main and front-facing cameras. We shipped our 13-megapixel, 8-megapixel and 4-megapixel products in higher volumes during our fiscal fourth quarter. We see this trend continuing through our first fiscal quarter as the market prepares to launch a wave of new products for the summer season. This is also the market where we scored our first 23-megapixel design win and where we shipped our revolutionary dual 8-megapixel camera platform. Last but not least, China continues to be the manufacturing channel that feeds the growing India market. Going forward, we see stronger trend to focus on image quality as opposed to resolution. In this regard, we are engaged in multiple opportunities in the China region that will utilize our sensor products that offer bigger pixels to enhance the image quality. In other regions, we continue to improve our position in the handset market with design wins in Korea, Japan, Taiwan and Europe. Additionally, some of these markets are developing dual camera designs using our sensors either for image quality improvement, form factor benefits or depth mapping applications. In the entertainment market, despite the overall decline attributed to the platform transition of one major tablet customer, we shipped a broad array of new sensor products to several other brand name tablet OEMs. Some tablets included our specialized global shutter sensors for depth mapping, running on a highly promoted Tier 1 chipset provider. The gaming industry where our product shipped to several OEMs also experienced a seasonal slowdown during our fiscal fourth quarter. Going forward, we see wearable devices entering into the entertainment or gaming segment that will use our imaging technologies, including image sensors or global shutter sensors. In the notebook/PC segment our revenues were flat quarter-on-quarter. We scored major design wins with significant Tier 1 OEM brands. The market, however, remains highly competitive. Shipments to the notebook market were mainly our workhorse 720p sensor, the OV9750. In the meantime, we're also introducing our next-generation 720p sensor that will enable lower cost point for our customers. The notebook category is converging with a tablet through the two-in-one type of device. As with the tablet, our global shutter sensors are being designed in for use in the highly touted depth mapping solution from the premier chipset provider in the computing space. The automotive market continues to offer rich opportunities for OmniVision. Quarter-on-quarter in revenue dollars, our automotive segment grew double-digits and was our second largest segment by revenue behind mobile in the fiscal fourth quarter. Steady revenue growth kept pace in Europe, Japan and North America. Shipments of our world class VGA for mainstream backup cameras in Tier 1 OEMs remain stable. Our 1-megapixel high dynamic range sensor, the OV10635, is designed into multiple surround view applications and has ramped up to significant volumes. Our next-generation 1-megapixel high dynamic range sensor, the OV10640, achieved qualification in a lead OEM project in Europe. Its sister product for machine vision, the OV10642, also scored a major Tier 1 OEM project in Europe. This solution is also integrated with the leading global machine vision system solution provider. In North America, we just completed a highly complex imaging solution for a unique automotive application that will be first in the market soon using our 1-megapixel sensor products and ASICs. Worldwide, we are also heavily engaged with Tier 1 OEMs for our next-generation 2-megapixel automotive products. Our emerging market segment is predominantly composed of our revenue in the security market. This market continues to expand worldwide at a very fast pace. We shipped a broad spectrum of sensor resolutions. The sweet spot at the moment is the 720p resolution node. We have successfully ramped up our specialized 4-megapixel sensor, the OV4689, which is used in high quality security systems. We also shipped an abundance of VGA resolution products. In the security market, there is also a strong IoT element to it. Multiple customers have embraced the sensor plus encrypted video streaming in ASIC chip solution, which is an ideal solution for wireless security cameras. The whole security segment is growing so rapidly that soon it will be possible for us to disclose the revenue stream separately much like we have done for the automotive business. Now, I will comment on some products and technologies recently announced by OmniVision. In the past fiscal quarter, we announced the release of our latest PureCel product, the OV16880. This is on the cutting-edge of sensor arrays, featuring a 16-megapixel array using 1.0 micron pixels. Additionally, the OV16880 is another stacked die product, where the underlying larger chip will host a variety of powerful ISP functions, including PDAF for rapid autofocus, interlaced HDR functionality and super-fast video streaming modes. The product supports a third inch form factor that enables a natural migration path from the third inch 13-megapixel product. The product is ideally suited for slim flagship smartphone products. Also announced was our first infrared color filter 720p image sensor, the OV9752. The product is ideal for security camera systems, where the RGB IR dual band color filter allows night time viewing as well as daylight imaging. The product will replace the traditional mechanical IR filter, thus saving cost and enhancing reliability. This product is ideal for the rapidly growing security market and IoT market. In summary, we feel strongly about our position in all key market segments. We continue to win business in mainstream markets as well as the emerging markets due to our broad spectrum of product offering. Shaw Hong - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Ray. I will now turn the call over to Anson who will discuss our fourth quarter financial performance and provide guidance for our first quarter of fiscal 2016. Anson Chan - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President Thank you, Shaw. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we are reporting revenues of $285.9 million, a respective decrease of 2.2% and 13.6% on a sequential and year-over-year basis. Direct sales to OEMs and VARs accounted for 76.5% of revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, a slight increase from 74.4% in the prior quarter. The remainder of our revenues came from sales through our distributor channels. Our fiscal 2015 fourth quarter gross margin was 22.4%, compared with the 22.1% that we reported in our prior quarter. Excluding stock-based compensation expense of $1.1 million included in cost of revenues, our non-GAAP gross margin was 22.7%, compared with 22.5% in the prior quarter. Gross margin continued to improve. We're able to further reduce our production costs in the fourth quarter. In addition, we experienced a favorable mix shift which also increased our ASPs. These improvements more than offset the net margin effect from the sales of previously written-off inventory and allowance for excess and obsolete inventories, which turned more unfavorable on a quarter-to-quarter basis. In the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded approximately $1.6 million of revenues for the sale of previously written-down inventory and $10.8 million as an additional allowance for excess and obsolete inventories, with a net $9.2 million or 3.3 percentage points of unfavorable impact on our gross margin. In comparison, in the prior quarter, we recorded approximately $3 million of revenues for the sale of previously written-down inventory and $9.6 million as an additional allowance for excess and obsolete inventories, with a net $6.6 million or 2.5 percentage points of unfavorable impact on our gross margin. Now, overall, the market is trending up and business seems to be recovering. However, we are still seeing volatility in our business in China, including demand fluctuations from some of our larger Tier 1 China customers. At this juncture, we believe it is prudent to remain conservative when it comes to expectations regarding our gross margin trajectory for fiscal 2016. R&D expense in our fiscal 2015 fourth quarter totaled $33.5 million, a slight increase from the $33.2 million in the prior quarter. We currently expect our R&D expenses in our first quarter of fiscal 2016 to increase by 6 percentage points to 8 percentage points due to increases in expenditure for tape-outs and stock-based compensation. R&D expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 included approximately $3.9 million of stock-based compensation expense. Excluding stock-based compensation expense, fiscal 2015 fourth quarter R&D expense was $29.5 million, as compared to $29 million in the prior quarter. SG&A expenses in our fiscal 2015 fourth quarter totaled $23.6 million, a 21% increase from the $19.5 million in the prior quarter. The increase is primarily the result of us incurring $4 million of success-based transaction costs when we signed the merger agreement with the consortium at the end of April. We expect our SG&A expenses in our first quarter of fiscal 2016 to be comparable to our fiscal fourth quarter of 2015, excluding the $4 million of success-based fees. Our fiscal 2015 fourth quarter SG&A expenses included approximately $3.3 million of stock-based compensation expense. Excluding stock-based compensation expense, SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 totaled $20.2 million, compared to $16.1 million in the prior quarter. The amount of amortization for acquired patent portfolio remained at $2.3 million per quarter. Our GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 totaled approximately $4.6 million, as compared to $9.6 million in the prior quarter. Our GAAP pre-tax income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 totaled $6.8 million, as compared to $10.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. Included in our fourth quarter pre-tax income is a one-time gain of approximately $0.6 million related to XinTec completing the stock listing on the Taiwan Stock Exchange in March 2015. XinTec is one of our equity investees in Taiwan, so OmniVision and VisEra participated in the listing as selling shareholders. And $0.2 million of the $0.6 million represented our direct gain, and the remaining $0.4 million represented our share of the gain as realized by VisEra. VisEra is a joint venture with TSMC in Taiwan that we accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Our GAAP tax expense for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 was $0.8 million. This compares with a GAAP tax benefit of $3.2 million in the prior quarter. As a reminder, included in the GAAP benefit from income taxes for the third quarter fiscal 2015 was the recognition of approximately $2.9 million in tax benefit as we wrapped up a foreign jurisdiction tax examination. There was also a one-time adjustment stemming from the administration's retroactive extension of federal R&D tax credits in December 2014, which provided an additional tax benefit to the company of approximately $3.6 million in the third quarter. Excluding the effects of stock-based compensation, our non-GAAP income tax expense for the fourth quarter fiscal 2015 was $1.3 million. This compares to our non-GAAP tax benefit for the prior quarter of $3.8 million. For the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect our GAAP income tax rate to be in the high-teens percentage range and our non-GAAP income tax rate will be in the high-single digit percentage range. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, our GAAP net income was $6 million or $0.10 on a per diluted share basis. This compares to $14 million or $0.23 per diluted share in the prior quarter. Excluding stock-based compensation expense and related tax effects, our non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter fiscal 2015 was $13.9 million or $0.22 per diluted share. This compares to non-GAAP net income of $23.3 million or $0.38 per diluted share in the prior quarter. Let me now turn to the balance sheet. We ended the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $524.2 million, an $11.4 million increase when compared to our $512.8 million balance at the end of our prior quarter. The increase our in cash position is primarily related to cash provided by operations. As of April 30, 2015, our inventory decreased to $344 million from the $366.4 million balance at the end of the last quarter. Our fiscal 2015 fourth quarter inventory balance represented an annual inventory turn of 2.6 times or 138 day sales from the 2.5 times or 148 day sales in the prior quarter. We're finally reverting (32:14) a trend for inventory buildup, and we are continuing our efforts to reduce inventory. Our long-term goal is to have an annual inventory turn of 4 times. Accounts receivable, at the end of our fiscal 2015 fourth quarter, net of allowances, were $151.1 million, an increase from the $141.7 million at the end of the prior quarter. Our day sales outstanding in the fourth quarter increased to 47 days from 45 days in the prior quarter. The increase in day sales outstanding was attributable to the Lunar New Year in February, which had skewed our shipments towards latter half of our fourth quarter. As mentioned previously, XinTec became a listed company on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. In addition to realizing a small gain of $0.6 million, we also changed our accounting method for XinTec from recording its value at our initial investment cost to recording at its market closing price on April 30, 2015. This resulted in a tax effective unrealized gain of approximately $37.7 million for the fourth quarter with $9.1 million in the tax effective unrealized gain on our direct holding in XinTec and $28.6 million being our share of VisEra's unrealized gain on its holdings in XinTec. And separately, regarding our investment in WLCSP, using the market closing price on April 30, 2015, our WLCSP stake is worth approximately $267.5 million, as compared to the recorded book value of $38.1 million at the end of our fourth fiscal quarter. With that, I will turn to our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2016, which ends on July 31, 2015. We currently expect our fiscal 2016 first quarter revenues will be in the range of $310 million to $340 million. Our GAAP EPS are expected to range from $0.17 to $0.33 per diluted share. Excluding the estimated expense and related tax effect associated with stock-based compensation, we expect our non-GAAP earnings will be in the range of $0.32 to $0.48 per diluted share. Shaw Hong - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Anson. From our strategy and execution perspective, we are pleased by the progress we made this quarter. We are as focused as ever in building the business and we believe our growth story remains intact. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. There are no questions in queue.
