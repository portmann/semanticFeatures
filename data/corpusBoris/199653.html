Home Depot: Macro Factors Favorable - Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) | Seeking Alpha Home Depot has exceeded Wall Street’s expectation in first two quarters of this fiscal. Transactions tickets of above $900, a key revenue driver, are showing consistent increase. Robust consumer sentiment along with U.S. households’ record high liquidity and net worth should further improve consumer spending, thereby, sales. Home Depot (NYSE: HD ), the world's leading home improvement retailer, has been having a good year, helped by robust consumer spending, improving wages and a stable job market. The stock, despite taking a hit due to recent volatility in the markets, caused by economic slowdown in China, large-scale capital outflows from emerging markets, and uncertainty tied to the rate-hike by the Federal Reserve-is still up about 16%, year-to-date. Home Depot, which is expected to report fiscal third quarter results in the third week of November, has posted better-than-expected results for the first two quarters of the current fiscal. It shouldn't come as a surprise if the retailer again exceeds analysts' expectations. Indeed, I expect Home Depot to continue its strong run not only in the current quarter but to extend it to the next year as well. Let's look at why I feel Home Depot is in a strong position to gain. Transaction tickets higher than $900, which makes about 20% of the domestic sales-revenue, have been witnessing a consistent high single digit percentage growth. While in the fiscal first quarter, transactions over $900 increased 6.8%, the second quarter saw 6.3% growth. The figures reflect Home Depot's growing traction in the home improvement market. Not only that, its average transaction size of $59.42 in the second quarter was highest since 2006, a period when home related spending hit the roof amid boom in the housing market. In my opinion, higher average ticket prices, should continue too a see an increment. While the holiday-season quarter should boost consumer spending, a rising consumer sentiment may provide further boost to sales, thereby, average ticket price. Overall retail sales , a key gauge on consumer spending, was up 0.2% in August following a 0.7% increase in July, according to the Commerce Department. The Conference Board's consumer confidence index was at 103.0 in September against economists' expectation for 97.0. More importantly though, I think lower energy prices would also continue to provide support to consumer spending as it increases disposable income among consumers, even as an extended period of lower interest rates should spur spending. The Fed's latest policy statement showed that the central bank is unlikely to raise interest rates in 2015. Household's liquidity and net worth at record high levels. The only way a consumer discretionary stock like Home Depot can come under pressure is when there is a significant pullback in the consumer sentiment and consumer confidence. However, this scenario looks unlikely given that household liquidity and balance sheets are very healthy now.Marketwatch's financial columnist Michael Brush, citing Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank, reported earlier this month that the net worth of U.S. households, a difference between assets and liabilities/obligations, has climbed to an all-time-high of $85.7 trillion during the second quarter. U.S. households have 29% more wealth than what they had during the peak of housing bubble in 2006. According to LaVorgna, rising wealth among Americans would further spur consumer spending. Likewise, U.S. households have also plenty of liquidity available now. The report showed that the ratio of assets to liability is at 2.37, which is way above the long-term average of 2.12. As I discussed earlier, more than half of Home Depot's customers own homes worth $200,000 or above. This high-income segment's spending remained mainly unaffected even during the post-financial crisis of 2009. Besides, spending of this segment (high-income) has risen at a faster pace than lower-income families since 2009. This is the segment which typically accounts for transaction tickets above $900.
