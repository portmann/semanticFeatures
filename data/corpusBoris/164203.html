It must go beyond the markets it already serves to all of the country. More than ever, China needs entrepreneurs to step up in order to make this strategy a success. It is becoming obvious the next step China should take in regard to its economy is to move to one that is more dependent upon consumer spending than investment, manufacturing and exports. In its command-and-control economy, it's easier to operate that way with investment and manufacturing because they lend themselves to that type of management style. In a consumer spending economy, that can no longer be the case. The government may be able to have an influence on who rises up in the ranks to serve that type of economy, but it can't control billions of transactions a day consumers decide to make to meet their wants and needs. It will probably try to in some way, but it will meet with total failure, which makes me wonder if the leadership has the will to go this route, and if they'll allow it to happen in a way it'll flourish. However it plays out, what drove Chinese growth in the past is fading, as Southeast Asian competitors rise up to challenge China in manufacturing and exports because of lower costs. The debt incurred from dubious "infrastructure" projects makes it cost prohibitive to continue in that vein. For China to successfully transition to a consumer spending economy, it means the government must get on board, and also, to a degree, get out of the way. This is a sector of the economy that demands creative entrepreneurs to lead, and that means the former economic leverage of the past will weaken. That's a good thing if it is allowed to happen. On the macro level, this is what investors want to watch for in China. If it is encouraged, China could boost GDP by as much as $67 trillion over the next decade, according to Louise Keely , SVP, Nielsen, and President, The Demand Institute. Research of a number of nations facing the need to transition to a consumer-led economy found they weren't always successful in making the jump, which presents an interesting challenge for China. China's consumption has been declining for decades and, with a gradual push toward consumer spending, the latest data suggest that may finally be leveling off, although there are no signs it has reversed as yet.

There's no doubt it knows it has to go this route in order to maintain meaningful economic growth, but as I mentioned earlier, it also knows its control over the economy will weaken. The point is, just because it says it's committed to encouraging an environment conducive to consumer spending growth, doesn't mean it's in a way we in the West would think of it. That said, if the government simply stays out of the way and allows entrepreneurs, retail and services to try different things, it would go a long way toward growing consumer spending. Another thing to keep in mind is, while consumer spending as a percentage of GDP is down, it doesn't mean it hasn't grown, it means investment and manufacturing have grown far faster. By that measure alone, consumer spending will improve as a percentage of GDP, but we're looking for the segment to experience real growth. To do so, there will have to be measures taken to improve the conditions under which consumers will be more apt to buy. Part of the move towards a consumer-based economy on the services side would be for sectors like health care and insurance to grow. Those have enormous potential when considering there are now approximately 1.4 billion people in China. The numbers there would be staggering. On the consumption side, in order to boost the retail sector, there will need to be improvements in credit, credit cards and banking. After the recent crash in the Chinese stock market, that may take a lot longer to implement than before, as consumers are much more cautious in spending after being cajoled into believing they should put their money in Chinese stocks because the bull market had a lot of legs left to it. To make it a comprehensive part of Chinese culture, there would also have to be the need for the majority of the Chinese to have access to goods and services. At this time, access is sporadic, and for consumption to gain long-term legs, there would be a need for shopping options in the majority of the country. Big cities would lead the way, of course, but there are millions of people in rural areas who could become a significant part of the Chinese economy if given a chance. The Internet is one way that it could be done. That would require an infrastructure that would allow for deliveries to most parts of the country. That will take some time to put in place. The value of the Internet in helping drive the economy is obvious. Less obvious is the need for the Chinese people to be able to research the availability and features of goods and services available to them. It would also help to differentiate between brands as they vie for consumer dollars. All of this would be a good impetus for entrepreneurs, who consequently would have to improve their offerings in order to attract the business of consumers. That would be a benefit to the entire country. Also important would be for people to be able to learn on the Internet, in general, which would provide a foundation for them to understand why a product or service should be wanted or needed. If China is able to make the transition to a consumer economy, I think the Internet will have to play a big role in the process. To show the depth of the level that China's consumption has fallen off, in 1952 consumption as a share of GDP came in at 76 percent. In 2011, it had plunged to 28 percent, according to the University of Pennsylvania's Center for International Comparisons, cited by Louise Keely. In the first half of 2015, Chinese consumption accounted for 60 percent of GDP growth at a time when national growth was the lowest in a quarter of a century. For that reason, the 60 percent has to be understood against the backdrop of a slowing economy; it's not as robust under that scenario. There should also be confusion concerning it being related to GDP growth alone, and not as part of the overall GDP. As for China's chances at successfully transitioning to a consumption economy, research suggests it's among those countries whose economic conditions have resulted in the failure to do so. In those cases, the percentage as part of the GDP leveled off, but wasn't able to grow, according to the Demand Institute. If that's how it plays out for China, it'll find it hard to find growth catalysts in the future. What is unique and challenging for China is it has to deal with a couple of headwinds that, in tandem, haven't been part of an economy working to make this transition. Those are "household income as a share of GDP, and the proportion of that income that householders choose to spend rather than save." In the past, countries able to turn around the drop in consumption as a percentage of GDP only had to solve one of those problems. Facing two of them will be hard to overcome for China. The Chinese government can encourage some of the steps needed to move toward an economy led by consumer spending, but it can only go so far before businesses take the reins and do what they do best. That means entrepreneurship, more than anything, is the key to successfully making this transition. Some of this is already happening, but the magnitude of the opportunity isn't close to being tapped. Unknown millions of Chinese haven't been participating as consumers in the economy, and if they can be convinced to do so, China will be able to regain some of its growth swagger at a time it is struggling to meet projections. That means there is the need for more entrepreneurs to emerge that understand local and regional wants and needs, and build products and services around them. The country has to go from one-size-fits-all to a more customized strategy. Only entrepreneurs have the ability to successfully identify these nuances and provide solutions to them. Some of this is already being done, but it only maintains the consumption as a percentage of GDP, it doesn't expand it. That's the issue that China's entrepreneurs have to solve in order to take full advantage of its potential. For that reason, demographic data across regions will have to be used to provide the information needed to make decisions on what products and services to develop. That will ultimately lead to a marketing initiative that will create the demand for the creation or improvement of distribution networks. Again, the key to growth is moving beyond what already exists in some of the larger urban areas. A cursory look at China would at first suggest it's in major trouble on the consumer spending side. That's not true. What's going on is what level consumer spending will rise to, not whether or not it will increase. For example, if nothing happens in relation to consumption as a percentage of GDP, where 28 percent remains the norm, the general growth of the Chinese economy, even if it slows down, will still enjoy consumer spending of about $53 trillion from 2015 through 2025, according to Keely. The best case scenario would be for consumption to expand to account for 46 percent of GDP by 2025, which would add $67 trillion to the economy during that 10-year period. Those numbers are extraordinary, but in reference to GDP growth, it's the difference between an average and a good performance. Investors need to look at some of the accompanying services we take for granted on a daily basis, such as credit agencies, credit cards and the availability of financing. Access to these services across China will determine the results of consumer spending growth. With that in place, entrepreneurs can work to identify potential markets and build products and services to meet those demands, while building out marketing and distribution networks. If this doesn't happen, China will continue to grow, but at a much slower rate than it has in the past, or is expected to in the future.
