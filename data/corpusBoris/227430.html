UPDATE 1-Portugal left closer to government deal, PM says could be ousted | Reuters Related: M&A, Bonds, Markets, Portugal LISBON Nov 6 (Reuters) - Portugal's Left Bloc has concluded talks with the moderate Socialists with the aim of creating an alternative government and the centre-right prime minister acknowledged on Friday he could be ousted. The far left party said on Friday its highest body had approved a document agreed during the talks with the centre-left Socialists and "the conditions are in place for a left-wing agreement to protect jobs, salaries and pensions". Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho's austerity-minded government was sworn in last week after his coalition won the most votes in an election on Oct. 4, but lost its majority in parliament, which swung to the left. The Socialists warned earlier this week time was running out to reach an agreement for a majority-backed, leftist government, which they have pledged to have in place before trying to topple the new cabinet next week in parliament. Speaking to reporters, Passos Coelho acknowledged for the first time that his government could be ousted. "If I am not prime minister as of Tuesday it will be because the Socialists did not let me continue ... I'll be where I am needed, in government which is the natural place for the one who won the election, but if I am potentially not in government but in opposition, I will assume my responsibilities," he said. The talks on a leftist government have raised fears over the prospects for Portugal's timid economic recovery because of instability and the fact that the potential partners reject some reforms imposed to escape a debt crisis. Over 100 entrepreneurs representing firms from cork-makers to motorways and construction, signed a manifesto arguing that uncertainty was already compromising investment,  balance sheets and jobs, while a leftist government would only make things worse because the far left are opposed to private business. Portuguese 10-year bond yields have risen more than 30 basis points since the election and edged up to 2.64 percent on Friday, although they are still lower than a year ago and well below their 2012 crisis-time peak of over 17 percent. The centre-left Socialists have argued that they can form a government backed by a leftist majority that would respect European budget rules. But the far left, especially the Communists, reject Brussels-imposed budget limits and have various other significant ideological divergences making a binding deal between them hard to achieve. Some Socialists also favour a centrist coalition rather than a deal with the radical left. The Socialists plan more talks with the Communists before next week's vote to see if they can bring them on board. The government agreed a legislative programme on Thursday, which parliament will debate on Monday before a vote on Tuesday or Wednesday. If parliament rejects the programme, the administration will fall. The Socialists have said they would not vote it down without a viable left-wing grouping in place. The government said it was "permanently ready to compromise with the Socialists" to secure their support and ensure the governability of the country.
