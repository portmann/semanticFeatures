Monetary Policy For Dilettantes And Day Traders | Seeking Alpha Since December the economy has behaved as expected. And soon the Fed will raise the policy rate. But the market will lose billions over the uncertainty around the Fedâ€™s choice of month: April? June? The only long-run effects of monetary policy are its effects on economic uncertainty and inflation. The debate over when to raise the policy rate increases this uncertainty needlessly. Monetary policy was changed as expected in December. And if we examine the key statutory objectives of policy -- unemployment and inflation -- they have performed as expected also since then. Why then, are the effects of the Fed's current policy debate so negative for the economy? Because the Fed's leadership is having a difficult time becoming unimportant. The Fed's policy ruminations are getting too much attention. Policymakers seem not to realize that their best option has become producing simple, easily interpreted decisions based on consensus, not a flood of disputed positions that will affect financial markets for the worse in the short run. How Should Monetary Policy Be Evaluated? The evaluation of monetary policy is similar to the evaluation of an investment portfolio. That is, policy should be judged by two factors: some measure of the real economic growth it creates; another measure for the uncertainty it creates. Why? Although real economic growth is the key to government economic policy, ultimately the fundamental effect of monetary policy on real economic growth is its effect on economic uncertainty. If the consumers and investors of the US have greater certainty about effects of their present and future plans because monetary policy creates confidence, then the Fed is performing well. Milton Friedman and his intellectual forebears were sometimes wrong on the details -- like policy based on M1 -- but their fundamental point remains unassailable. If we wait long enough, monetary policy has no direct effect on real growth; its sole effects are on uncertainty and the rate of inflation. Monetary policy matters for economic growth because in the short run it affects economic uncertainty. Uncertainty, in turn, temporarily reduces economic growth. But if the combined effect of the remarks of the current herd of cats comprising the Federal Reserve Board and 12 Reserve Bank Presidents is considered, their ability to create uncertainty is nothing short of phenomenal. Too much information. Is the "dot plot" important? Apparently. Information That Matters To Dilettantes And Day Traders The Fed, we are told, is data driven. It looks at everything. But the reality, at the moment, is that very little of this data matters. The current public debate over the very limited options for meeting Fed objectives, stable growth and inflation, have the sickly sweet smell of politics and old cabbage: annoying and useless. The Fed's current monetary policy significance is reminiscent of a bad hangover. Policy still is important because the markets remember how very important it was during the Crisis, reacting to every innocent comment in a Fed official's speech. The Fed, at its best, is like a wise paterfamilias. When the economy is stumbling along on its own, with relatively normal economic growth and relatively normal inflation, the Fed belongs in the background, allowing markets to find their own path. Only when other economic actors make monumental errors, as with the Volcker Fed war against inflation and the Bernanke Fed recovery from the Financial Crisis, does the Fed have a major role to play in offsetting the negative effects of other players. Then, a major change in monetary policy, like a flood gate, can open and flood the economy with liquidity (Bernanke) or dry up the flood waters (Volcker). Those two crises will, one day, be remembered as the brightest moments in the history of monetary policy. But most of the time, the Fed belongs in the background. It is time for monetary policy to take a lower profile. We needed forward guidance, the dot plot, interest on excess reserves and all the rest of today's policy baggage during the Crisis. Now they are important mainly to day traders and policy dilettantes. A single policy rate and a single significant human voice enunciating the Fed's intentions once a quarter would best reduce the prevailing uncertainty about future policy. Transparency is great: publish the FOMC minutes immediately, so that investors can come to the correct conclusion that these minutes are shared boring trivia. It would be more helpful if the Fed shared what experts don't know. For example, experts have no idea whether the outdated 4% real growth and 2% core inflation objective is in any abstract sense more appropriate than the current actual 2% real growth and 1% inflation. What is clear is that any reasonable expert who was told that, during the three-month period following December, unemployment would fall with unchanged core inflation, would see no reason for the Fed to change policy now. We knew long ago that there were negative effects on the US economy of poorly managed economic policies in Asia and Europe. But they are negative in the long run and insignificant in the short run. This was true before these policies started to receive so much ink in late 2015. It's still true. We also knew that these economies are hamstrung: Europe, by its inability to cooperate; China, by its inability to let markets work. They will be a drag on US economic growth for the foreseeable future -- a drag that monetary policy is powerless to change. They have no role in monetary policy-making, both by statute and because it's common sense. Policy-maker hand-wringing over these matters and other issues that policy is powerless to influence only increases market uncertainty by introducing the possibility that the monetary policy sledge hammer will be used to swat the Chinese fly. What are the real options for policymakers right now? Very few. But we can still unfortunately expect considerable economic uncertainty over the obvious quarterly 25 basis point increase in the policy rate. Should it be in March, April, or maybe June? This debate will cost billions in the securities marketplace, but its effect on the economy (apart from the cost of the market's uncertainty) on a scale of 1 to 10, is zero.
