UPDATE 1-Canada posts budget surplus in 2014-15, earlier than expected | Reuters (Adds details, background, comments) OTTAWA, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Canada posted a budget surplus in 2014-15 to end a string of deficits a year earlier than expected, final numbers showed on Monday, bringing welcome news for the Conservatives' re-election campaign. The country had a surplus of C$1.9 billion ($1.4 billion), the finance department's Annual Financial Report of the Government of Canada showed. The deficit had been projected at C$2.0 billion in the most recent budget released in April. It was the first the first time Canada was in the black since 2007-08. The government ran six consecutive years of deficits starting in 2008-09 after launching a spending program to boost the economy following the global credit crisis. The government has promised to run a surplus for the current fiscal year, but with the slumping price of oil, the opposition has questioned whether it will succeed. The left-leaning New Democratic Party has also pledged balanced budgets, while the Liberals plan to run deficits in order to spend on stimulus. Liberal Party Leader Justin Trudeau said Harper had cut spending in order to deliver the balanced budget ahead of the election. "It was a political goal that actually has helped us slide into ... recession," Trudeau said. Still, the news could bolster Prime Minister Stephen Harper's argument the government will be able to stay in surplus and give credibility to the Conservatives' claim of good fiscal management. Harper, speaking on CFRA radio ahead of the report, said the economy was growing this year and it would be wrong to run a deficit during a year of growth. A budget watchdog earlier in July projected a C$1.0 billion deficit this year after using up the budget's C$1 billion contingency reserve, in contrast to the government budget forecast for a C$1.4 billion surplus, plus the reserve. In the first three months of the fiscal year that began in April, the government has posted a C$5.01 billion surplus, helped by the sale of its General Motors shares. The federal ratio of debt to gross domestic product was 31.0 percent as of the end of the fiscal year, down from 32.3 percent the year before. A wider measure of debt as reported by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development puts Canada's total government net debt-to-GDP ratio at 40.4 percent in 2014. The measure includes provincial and local governments, as well as pension plan assets. That is the lowest level among Canada's Group of Seven peers and less than half of the G7's average.
