Why Is The Mexican Peso Underperforming? | Seeking Alpha We analyze here some reasons why the Mexican Peso (MXN) could be underperforming, besides well-known external factors. The twin current account and fiscal deficits could be contributing to the underperforming story of the Mexican peso. Donald’s Trump chances of winning will be correlated with the MXN’s performance, especially by October-November. During recent episodes of volatility in financial markets, the Mexican peso has become a crucial currency in the EM world. Its volume and high liquidity makes the MXN a natural hedge, and it is common to hear that for that reason the peso underperforms, given that its current level does not correspond to the strength of Mexico's macroeconomic fundamentals.

The so awaited comeback of second largest Latin American country's currency not only will depend on the reduction of volatility, but also on how the fiscal and current account deficits adjust to Mexico's new realities. In Q1, Mexico's surplus in its financial account of $8.6 billion was more than enough to finance the $7 billion deficit in the current account. However, weaker global growth is having a direct effect in Mexico's open economy, and the country's current account trend is putting pressure on the peso. Mexico's goods and services trade deficit reached $5.1 billion in 1Q16, mainly affected by the sluggish oil industry. According with the country's central bank, Mexico went from having a surplus in its oil balance worth 1% of GDP, to a deficit of the same magnitude. Mexico is importing more gasoline and natural gas amid low energy prices, but the oil shock has had a dual negative effect in exports. It brought down the $45.4/b of the Mexican mix in 1Q15 to $26/b in 1Q16. Mexican oil exports declined 45% year-on-year (YoY) as a result. The oil shock has also reduced the needed investments to stop the fall in oil output, which decreased in almost 200kbbl/d last year. Mexico's crude exports in Q1 are down 125kbbl/d YoY. Going forward, it is not clear that the MXN will benefit from increases in oil prices. Mexico is now a net importer of energy. The trade energy balance is likely to remain negative, and the performance of the current account will depend on the US economy's performance and on Mexican manufacturing exports. Banxico estimates that Mexico's current account deficit will grow to reach 3% of the country's GDP at the end of 2016. Regarding the country's fiscal balance, Mexico was allowed by Congress to implement an expansionary fiscal policy, which took public sector borrowing requirements ( OTCQX:PSBR ) as high as 4.6% of GDP in 2014. Gross debt as a share of GDP was 54% in 2015 and it is expected to reach 55% in 2016. But in order to be allowed to increase public expenditure, the federal government committed to reduce progressively its PSBR starting in 2015 using the 2014 fiscal reform, and to reduce its expenditures in subsequent years. Peña Nieto's administration committed to take PSBR to 2.5% by 2018. By April, the public fiscal balance presented a surplus of MXN 177 billion ($9.8 billion), which contrasted with last year's MXN 116 billion ($7.3 billion) surplus. The extraordinary $13 billion transfer that the central bank made explains most of the difference; however, the effects of Mexico's fiscal reform are still visible. Tax revenues keep increasing at the order of 7.5% YoY. Mexico is likely to meet its fiscal consolidation targets for this year. In fact, Banxico's transfer is set to reduce Mexico's PSBR lower than the needed 3.5% of GDP for this year. The federal government is using those resources to capitalize state-owned Pemex-buy back debt and increase its fiscal stability fund. LATAM PM's Take: The twin current account and fiscal deficits could be contributing to the underperforming story of the Mexican peso. While Mexican officials are already taking important steps towards fiscal consolidation, the country's current account balance is likely to remain negative as Mexico gets used to being a net energy importer. For that reason, the comeback of the Mexican currency is not only contingent on the reduction of volatility, but in the development of Mexico's external position going forward. We still expect the referendum on Brexit, the decisions of the Fed and US presidential election to add pressure on the MXN. Donald's Trump chances of winning will be correlated with the MXN's performance, especially by October-November. All these reasons, in addition to the current account deficit, indicate that the peso will continue to underperform for a while. A Mundell-Fleming framework would suggest that any restrictive fiscal policy efforts should help the currency eventually. However, we still need to see bolder government actions. Expect Finance Minister Luis Videgaray to give more details of further spending cuts once the domestic 2016 electoral calendar is now over.
