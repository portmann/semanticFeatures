OECD Demands "Urgent" Policy Response As Global Growth Heartbeat "Flatlines" | Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! Last year, virtually all the very â€œserious peopleâ€? threw in the towel on global growth and trade. Itâ€™s been apparent for quite some time (like say, a couple of years) that the slump in trade growth has likely become structural and endemic as opposed to transient and cyclical in the post crisis world. As WSJ noted last autumn , 2015 marked the third year in a row that the rate of growth in global trade trailed the already sluggish expansion of global GDP. â€œItâ€™s almost like the timing belt on the global growth engine is a bit off or the cylinders are not firing as they should,â€? WTO chief economist Robert Koopman remarked. Part of the shift is due to Chinaâ€™s transition from an investment-led, smokestack economy to a consumption and services led model and the rest is attributable to the fact that things simply â€œainâ€™t what they used to beâ€? in terms of economic fundamentals. All of this led the OECD to cut its forecast for global growth last September to 3% for 2015. â€œGlobal growth prospects have weakened slightly and the outlook is clouded by important uncertainties,â€? the organization said, adding that â€œemerging economies have vulnerabilities that could be exposed by rising US interest rates and/or a sharper-than-expected slowdown in China, giving rise to financial and economic turbulence that could also exert a significant drag on advanced economies.â€? Make no mistake, 2016 has certainly demonstrated that EM is vulnerable to liftoff and that a Chinese hard landing (and the attendant devaluation of the yuan) has indeed precipitated â€œfinancial and economic turbulenceâ€? with the potential to spill over into advanced economies. Given that, we werenâ€™t surprised to see the OECD cut their 2016 growth forecast to 3% from 3.3% in November. â€œGlobal economies have flatlined,â€? read a tweet from the OECDâ€™s official Twitter. â€œUrgent policy response needed.â€? By â€œurgent policy response,â€? the OECD is attempting to encourage G-20 finance ministers to come to some kind of consensus in China next week. In other words, they're hoping for a so-called "Shanghai Accord", a reference to the 1985 Plaza Accord which, as BofA reminds us, "agreed to weaken the USD to help America improve its huge trade deficit and spur economic growth out of the doldrums of the early-1980s." Now that monetary policy has failed miserably when it comes to reviving global demand and trade, the world is looking to fiscal policy for answers. It's right out of the Ben Bernanke playbook: rate cuts and QE not working? Blame lawmakers.  "Fiscal policy is now contractionary in many major economies. Structural reform momentum has slowed," the OECD warns. "All three levers must be deployed more actively to create stronger and sustained growth." It's not even clear what that means. "Structural reform" presumably refers to fiscal consolidation but fiscal retrenchment isn't at all compatible with fiscal stimulus, so how can "all three levers" be simultaneously "deployed"? Indeed, that's the challenge facing the likes of Brazil and Greece.  Whatever the case, don't expect policymakers to come to some kind of grand consensus in Shanghai. "Itâ€™s probably too early to expect a Shanghai Accord," BofA's Michael Hartnett said, late last month. "[The risk in] 2016 is that markets need to panic before there's a coordinated policy response."

Thu, 02/18/2016 - 12:29 | 7202707 MillionDollarBonus_ I've been calling for emergency fiscal and monetary stimulus on this blog for years now, and nobody listened. Dr Paul Krugman has explained the problem we face in layman's terms: we have a lack of demand. When you have no demand, you have no revenue, and without revenue you have no jobs. Demand is the heart of an economy, and currency is the blood. We need to get the heart of the economy beating again so that the money can once again flow, and we can continue to enjoy the economic prosperity that the science of economics has brought us over the last 100 years. If we fail to follow these recommendations, we face a gloomy future that no-one can claim we weren't warned about by countless economic professors such as Dr Krugman.

Thu, 02/18/2016 - 12:57 | 7202901 Oldwood Maybe we could ramp DEMAND in this country if we simply put a gun to everyone's head and DEMANDED that they purchase any and all things they could beg borrow or steal the funds to do so. Government has used taxation as the hammer to force people to do what they wanted and as income falls, that hammer gets weaker and weaker. With negative rates at hand maybe we will soon be paid to borrow...maybe income tax CREDITS for borrowing, and elimination of income taxes on defaulted debt. I know we are all waiting for cashless currency, and it will likely happen eventually, but until then, I think they will simply tax all cash withdrawals. We are in a box, and not gold, or bitcoin or anything else will make much difference over the long haul.

Let the big banks fail with their awful debt and let capitalism actually work!  Thu, 02/18/2016 - 12:37 | 7202758 Soul Glow Moar muppet fleecing to save our overlords, for it is they who know best and we who are but peasants. Thu, 02/18/2016 - 12:32 | 7202720 11b40 Here is a really good policy response - break up the big banks, end the FED and other Central Money Printers, and prosecute Wall Street Criminals....with financial clawbacks of ill-gotten gains along with jail time. While we are at it, another really good common sense policy response would be to end the practice of allowing dual citizens to hold any type of critical position in Government, Banking, or Defense contracting that would require a security clearance.

Warren Buffett China is now the workshop of the world. Chinaâ€™s problems clearly illustrate the lack of global demand. China manufactures its products from imported raw materials from other emerging economies, so these in turn suffer from the lack of global demand for Chinaâ€™s finished goods. Global commodity prices and the Baltic Dry Index are at record lows illustrating this collapse in demand. Capitalism is like Siamese twins at war with each other. The 1% and 99% always fighting each other to get more, but if either side win they destroy each other. The 1% were in the ascendency in the 1920s and blew it up with a Wall Street Crash in 1929. The 99% were in the ascendency in the 1970s and blew it up with constant strikes making individual nations uncompetitive. The 1% are in the ascendency again and have already caused another Wall Street Crash (2008) plunging the world into a global recession that seems without end. The 1% havenâ€™t worked out that they have gone to war against the consumers that buy their products and services. Obviously this was all spotted by Marx a long time ago, but he had never seen the results of the 99% in power (Pol Potâ€™s Cambodia, Stalinâ€™s Russia, Maoâ€™s China, etc ...). He came from a wealthy family and was only too aware of the greed, self-interest and hypocrisy in his own class. It doesnâ€™t seem to matter which ideology you try and follow the psychopaths always end up in the positions of power. Capitalism is an endless fight between the two sides, but neither side can win, to do so destroys themselves. A more balanced approach is needed but the very thing that makes Capitalism work, self-interest and greed, ensures neither side is ever happy with their lot and always wants more. Let's enact negative interest rates, get rid of cash, prop the stock market, and steal what's left of the middle class.

It is simple.  Cut gubmints by say 2/3 worldwide, watch standards of living around the world finally begin to rise again. Limited gubmint is arguably a necessary evil.  Gubmint beyond the bare minimum is ruinous, a cancer on the citizenry, and it grows inexorably, insidiously, largely unchecked.  A 'world gubmint' would be the ultimate evil.  In the West we have savings rates of nearly zero as the population has the safety net of a welfare state. In your country you have no welfare state and everyone is saving for a rainy day, this undermines consumption. Your wealthy population have been buying property around the globe, what does this do for you? Thu, 02/18/2016 - 12:51 | 7202855 agent default You want urgent policy response?  Here is policy response.  Cut taxes, cut government spending, cut bureaucracy, bring back confidence to people that the government will not try to get its tentacles into their property and bank accounts on  a global scale and then once confidence is established you will get economic activity.   Of course by urgent action what the OECD really means is to come up with new ways to harass/blackmail people into spending whatever they have saved,  increase taxes on savings so that people will not even try to save, the subtle point that people will tend to be less productive under such circumstances, lost to the OECD idiots who never had a real job to begin with.
