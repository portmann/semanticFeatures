Research: In-depth coverage of more than 5200 stocks, many of which have little or no coverage         elsewhere. On 12/1/2015, FSC reported results for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015. FSC reported NII, EPS, and net ICTI of $0.184, ($0.016), and $0.214 per share, respectively. In addition, FSC disclosed the company recorded various prior period adjustments during the quarter which affected the companyâ€™s balance sheet and past income statements. These prior period adjustments pertained to FSC incorrectly recognizing certain fee income at the time of a loanâ€™s origination as opposed to the estimated life of the debt investment. This article discusses the cumulative impacts of FSCâ€™s prior period adjustments. In particular, this analysis focuses on fiscal year impacts to NII, earnings, and net ICTI. In addition to my BUY, SELL, or HOLD recommendation, this article provides some positive and negative factors to consider when choosing FSC as a possible equity investment. On 12/1/2015, Fifth Street Finance Corp. (NASDAQ: FSC ) reported results for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015. FSC generated quarterly net investment income ("NII") of $0.184 per share, net assets resulting from operations (also known as EPS) of ($0.016) per share, net investment company taxable income ("ICTI") of $0.214 per share, and NAV of $9.00 per share as of 9/30/2015. Due to time constraints between my professional career and writing articles on other stocks, I was unavailable to provide readers a quarterly projection article in regards to FSC for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015. However, I still performed all the usual research and data compilation that is required to project FSC's NII, EPS, and NAV for the quarter. Available to readers who requested these specific projections, I estimated FSC would report quarterly NII of $0.186 per share, EPS of ($0.011) per share, and NAV of $8.95 per share as of 9/30/2015. As such, FSC's NII and EPS basically matched my projections while the company's NAV was a minor outperformance. When calculated, my NAV projection had a variance of $0.05 per share which was well within my stated range of $8.80 - $9.10 per share. Similar to what was experienced across most business development company ("BDC") peers during the calendar third quarter of 2015, FSC recorded an elevated level of net depreciation within the company's investment portfolio during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015. For readers unfamiliar to the recent trends that have occurred, interest rates fell across many facets of the U.S. and global bond markets during FSC's fiscal fourth quarter of 2015. This trend, along with negative sentiment regarding most "fixed-income"/debt investment vehicles during the quarter, caused a notable increase/widening in volatility/spreads. This caused varying levels of underperformance within residential/commercial mortgages, corporate bonds, and the high yield debt market. Spreads within most lower middle market ("LMM"), middle market ("MM"), and syndicated loans modestly - materially widened during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015. Based on this notion (and several other analytical factors), I accurately projected the net change to FSC's investment portfolio consisted of numerous modest - material (proportionately speaking) unrealized "fair market value" ("FMV") fluctuations. Along with reporting earnings, management disclosed FSC recorded various prior period adjustments during the quarter which affected the company's balance sheet and prior period income statements. While prior period adjustments are more easily reflected within a company's balance sheet (since the balance sheet is a cumulative report of a company's operations at a stated point in time), in my professional opinion these type of adjustments are not as easily reflected in a company's income statement, especially when tracking results "quarter-to-quarter". As such, I wanted to provide this article so readers can better understand how FSC's prior period adjustments directly impacted the company's annual NII, EPS, and net ICTI. This analysis should also assist other contributors/analysts in better understanding how FSC's future revenues will be impacted. When FSC reported earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015, it was also disclosed that the company's external manager, Fifth Street Asset Management (NASDAQ: FSAM ) erroneously calculated its portion of management fees (account description at the FSAM level) over a period of several years. These erroneous calculations occurred because FSC and the company's affiliate Fifth Street Senior Floating Rate Corp. (NASDAQ: FSFR ) revised each company's accounting treatment of certain fees when loans were originated. Over the several years I covered FSC and FSFR, management continued to "front load" certain advisory, servicing, and/or structuring fees in relation to loan originations. In prior articles, I have noted this was more of an "aggressive stance" regarding revenue recognition under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"). I also stated the more cautious/consistent treatment of such fees were to recognize revenue over the estimated life of the applicable loan. The following quote provided by FSC within the company's 10-K for the fiscal year ended 9/30/2015 supports the discussion above: "…During the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company identified errors in the recognition of fee income from fiscal years ended 2012 through 2015, as well as the consolidation of First Star holding companies in 2015. The errors primarily related to recognizing fee income at deal close when the amounts did not represent a separately identifiable revenue stream and instead were more related to underwriting the investment. These errors mainly affected the timing of when income should be recognized and were partially offset by the overpayment of Part I Fees paid to FSM…" So, in other words, due to each company's change in accounting treatment, FSC and FSFR overstated certain portions of revenue while overpaying each company's respective share of incentive fees to FSAM for several years. Since FSC and FSFR made prior period adjustments to the recognition of certain revenue, partially offset by a reduction in incentive fees paid to FSAM, both company's prior period financial statements were impacted for most quarters. Since this is a revenue recognition "timing" issue, in future quarters both FSC and FSFR should actually record additional revenue from these specific loans since revenue is now more properly being recognized over the estimated life of the loan versus recognizing the entire amount of applicable fees at origination. In addition, the following quote confirms that FSC's prior period adjustments, pertaining to the income statement, were not cumulatively recorded within the company's fiscal fourth quarter of 2015 due to materiality. Instead, all 2012-2014 adjustments were cumulatively shown in the fiscal first quarter of 2015 and all other adjustments were shown in each applicable quarter: "…The Company determined that correction of the cumulative errors through 2015 in the financial statements for the three months ended September 30, 2015 would have been material to the interim period's results, and that the impact of these errors, although not material was more than insignificant to the financial statements for the three months ended December 31, 2014. Accordingly, the Company has adjusted quarterly financial information for the fiscal year 2015 quarters…in addition to other unrelated, immaterial out-of-period adjustments that were not previously recorded…." As such, I believe analyzing how FSC's prior period adjustments impacted the company's income statement is necessary in fully understanding the impacts this event had in regards to the company's NII, EPS, (which are based on GAAP) and net ICTI (which is based on "Internal Revenue Code" ["IRC"] methodologies) for the fiscal year 2015. Analysis of FSC's Prior Period Adjustments and the Impacts to NII and EPS (Per GAAP): For this analysis, Table 1 is provided below. Table 1 shows FSC's income statement (technically speaking the company's "consolidated statement of operations") for the fiscal year 2015 before and after all prior period adjustments are accounted for. It should also be noted several adjustments shown within Table 1 below are not "directly" related to the company's change in accounting treatment of recognizing certain fee income but are related to other, miscellaneous prior period adjustments. I believe these other adjustments are relevant to the analysis provided within this article as all adjustments directly impacted FSC's fiscal year 2015 NII and EPS. As such, these miscellaneous adjustments are also included in the analysis provided below. (Source: Table created entirely by myself, partially using FSC data obtained from the SEC's EDGAR Database ) Using Table 1 above as a reference, before FSC's prior period adjustments, the company would have reported total "interest income" of $217.3 million. Instead, FSC reported "revised" total interest income of $215.9 million. When calculated, this was a decrease of ($1.4) million. Moving down Table 1, before FSC's prior period adjustments, the company would have reported total "payment-in-kind ("PIK") interest income" of $14.4 million. Instead, FSC reported revised total PIK interest income of $13.4 million. When calculated, this was a decrease of ($1.0) million. Continuing to move down Table 1, before FSC's prior period adjustments, the company would have reported total "fee income" of $36.7 million. Instead, FSC reported revised fee income of only $22.3 million. As one can see, this was a material decrease of ($14.5) million (rounded). As stated earlier, this net adjustment was mainly attributable to reversing out certain fee income that was front-loaded at the time of loan origination which was now being recognized over the estimated life of the applicable loans. Moving down to the last revenue classification, before FSC's prior period adjustments, the company would have reported total "dividend and other income" of $10.0 million. Instead, FSC reported revised total dividend and other income of $13.9 million. When calculated, this was an increase of $3.9 million. Before FSC's prior period adjustments, when all four revenue classifications are combined, the company would have reported "total investment income" of $278.4 million. Instead, FSC reported revised total investment income of $265.5 million. When calculated, this was a decrease of ($12.9) million. Moving to the expense side of the income statement, there was only one account affected by FSC's prior period adjustments, the company's "incentive fees". As shown above, since FSC recorded a lower amount of revenues during fiscal year 2015, FSAM revised the amount of incentive fees that should have been paid by the company for each applicable timeframe. Before FSC's prior period adjustments, the company would have reported total incentive fees of $31.2 million. Instead, FSC reported revised total incentive fees of $28.6 million. When calculated, this was a decrease of ($2.6) million. As such, FSC also reported a net decrease in total/net expenses of ($2.6) million. Before FSC's prior period adjustments, when the company's total investment income and net expense figures are combined, management would have reported NII of $125.3 million. When looking at the bottom of Table 1, this calculates to a NII of $0.82 per share for the fiscal year 2015. Instead, FSC reported revised NII of only $114.9 million. This calculates to a revised NII of only $0.75 per share. As such, FSC's prior period adjustments negatively impacted the company's annual NII by ($10.3) million (rounded) or ($0.07) per share. When considering EPS impacts, before FSC's prior period adjustments, the company would have reported net unrealized depreciation of ($84.6) million. Instead, FSC reported revised net unrealized depreciation of only ($71.7) million. Again, this net adjustment was mainly attributable to reversing out certain fee income that was front-loaded at the time of loan origination which was now being recognized over the estimated life of the applicable loans. Since FSC basically "over-booked" revenue of certain portfolio companies at all applicable loan originations, the company also "undervalued" certain loans at the beginning stages of the investment. Since most valuation methodologies typically use some sort of projected discounted cash flow analysis (amongst several other acceptable valuation techniques), since FSC was now reporting lower revenue at an applicable loan's origination (at the beginning of the loan), additional revenue was now forecasted to be recognized over the remaining estimated life of the loans. As such, valuations typically increase at the beginning stages of an investment's lifetime when less revenue is being recognized at origination. This is due to the fact more revenue is now being projected to be received over the remaining estimated life of the loan. When calculated, FSC's $12.9 million valuation adjustment to the company's investment portfolio concurs with this general methodology. Before FSC's prior period adjustments, when the company's NII and investment portfolio valuation figures are combined, management would have reported a "net decrease in net assets resulting from operations (also known as EPS)" of $12.8 million. When looking at the bottom of Table 1, this calculates to an EPS of $0.08 per share for the fiscal year 2015. Instead, FSC reported revised EPS of $15.4 million. This calculates to a revised EPS of $0.10 per share. As such, FSC's prior period adjustments positively impacted the company's annual EPS by $2.6 million or $0.02 per share. Now that we have an understanding of the specific impacts FSC's prior period adjustments had on the company's NII and EPS, let us take this analysis a step further and see the specific impacts to the company's net ICTI (which is based on IRC methodologies). This will be beneficial when trying to project FSC's near-term dividend sustainability. Analysis of FSC's Prior Period Adjustments and the Impact to Net ICTI (Per the IRC): For this analysis, Table 2 is provided below. Table 2 shows FSC's reconciliation from EPS to net ICTI for the fiscal year 2015 before and after all prior period adjustments are accounted for. As was the case within Table 1 above, it should also be noted several adjustments shown within Table 2 below are not directly related to the company's change in accounting treatment of recognizing certain fee income but are related to other, miscellaneous prior period adjustments. I believe these other adjustments are relevant to the analysis provided within this article as all adjustments directly impacted FSC's fiscal year 2015 net ICTI. As such, these miscellaneous adjustments are also included in the analysis provide below. (Source: Table created entirely by myself, partially using FSC data obtained from the SEC's EDGAR Database [link provided below Table 1]) Using Table 2 above as a reference, before FSC's prior period adjustments, the company would have reported total EPS of $12.8 million. Instead, FSC reported revised total EPS of $15.4 million. As was discussed when analyzing the impacts to FSC's NII and EPS earlier in the article, this was an increase of $2.6 million. Moving down Table 2, before FSC's prior period adjustments, the company would have reported net unrealized depreciation on investments and secured borrowings of ($84.0) million. Instead, FSC reported revised net unrealized depreciation on investments and secured borrowings of only ($71.0) million. As was discussed when analyzing the impacts to FSC's NII and EPS earlier in the article, this was an increase of $12.9 million (rounded). When it comes to IRC methodologies, all unrealized investment valuation fluctuations are reversed out of EPS when reconciling to net ICTI since a "realized" event has yet to occur. As such, since FSC recorded a net unrealized depreciation adjustment of ($12.9) million (rounded), the company's reversal of net unrealized depreciation decreased from an initial $84.0 million to only $71.0 million. As such, when combining FSC's EPS increase of $2.6 million and net unrealized depreciation adjustment of ($12.9) million, FSC's net ICTI for the fiscal year 2015 decreased by ($10.3) million. When looking towards the bottom of Table 2, before FSC's prior period adjustments, the company would have reported total net ICTI of $0.858 per share for the fiscal year 2015. This calculates to an annual dividend distributions payout ratio of 92%. Instead, FSC reported revised net ICTI of only $0.791 per share for the fiscal year 2015. When calculated, FSC's prior period adjustments negatively impacted net ICTI by ($0.068) per share for the fiscal year 2015. This calculates to a revised annual dividend distributions payout ratio of 100%. Even though FSC's prior period adjustments increased the company's annual dividend distributions payout ratio, the company's material reduction to its monthly per share rate in February 2015 allowed management to properly match net ICTI to dividend distributions for the fiscal year 2015 (hence the payout ratio of 100%). FSC's more conservative approach to the company's dividend in 2015 is extremely similar to a change in rhetoric by Prospect Capital Corp. (NASDAQ: PSEC ) earlier in the year. A discussion of PSEC's change in dividend policy (beginning in February 2015) was provided in the following article: I believe this was an "as expected" quarter for FSC when comparing my projections to actual results. FSC's NII and EPS basically matched my projections while the company's NAV was a minor outperformance. Similar to what was experienced across most BDC peers, FSC recorded an elevated level of net depreciation within the company's investment portfolio during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015. I accurately projected the net change to FSC's investment portfolio consisted of numerous modest - material (proportionately speaking) unrealized FMV fluctuations. What was more interesting/important in my opinion was the fact that along with reporting quarterly earnings, FSC disclosed the company recorded various prior period adjustments during the quarter which affected its balance sheet and prior period income statements. Due to a change in FSC's accounting treatment for recognizing revenue on certain loans, along with various other prior period adjustments, the company reported revised NII of $114.9 million for the fiscal year 2015. When calculated, FSC's prior period adjustments negatively impacted the company's NII by ($10.3) million or ($0.07) per share for the fiscal year 2015. In addition, through an increase in certain portfolio company investment valuations (which was in direct relation to the reduction of fee income being recognized), FSC reported revised EPS of $15.4 million for the fiscal year 2015. When calculated, FSC's prior period adjustments positively impacted the company's EPS by $2.6 million or $0.02 per share for the fiscal year 2015. Furthermore, due to the decrease in NII and increase in net unrealized depreciation on investments and secured borrowings, FSC reported revised net ICTI of $121.1 million for the fiscal year 2015. When calculated, FSC's prior period adjustments negatively impacted the company's net ICTI by ($10.3) million or ($0.07) per share for the fiscal year 2015. Due to FSC's prior period adjustments, the company's annual dividend distributions payout ratio increased from 92% to 100%. However, I believe it should also be noted this has been the first fiscal year since 2010 where FSC has generated annual net ICTI that either equaled or was less than annual dividend distributions. I believe this should be seen as a positive trend. In addition, FSC's net ICTI of $0.214 per share for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015 should be seen as an encouraging sign as this surpasses the company's quarterly dividend distributions by a modest amount ($0.034 per share). As such, I do not anticipate a reduction in FSC's dividend per share rate for at least the first-half of calendar year 2016 (through June 2016). In my opinion, the following positive factors should be highlighted for existing and potential FSC shareholders: 1) stock price continues to trade at a material discount to CURRNET NAV; 2) continued rhetoric stating the company has not asked for shareholder approval to issue shares of common stock below CURRENT NAV; 3) minor remaining exposure to the oil and gas sector; and 4) activist investor RiverNorth Capital has publicly commented it wants the company to structurally change several key aspects of its business operations/strategies (which would be beneficial to shareholders). However, the following cautionary/negative factors should cause heightened awareness for existing and potential FSC shareholders: 1) continued low NII and net ICTI per share figures when compared to most BDC peers (mainly due to a rise in non-accruals over the past year); 2) continued modest to material depreciation on several control/non-control investments; 3) "Non-Amendment" of the company's Investment Advisory Agreement with FSAM pertaining to its "existing capital" (regarding the "2%/20%" fee structure); and 4) recent litigation involving FSC's executive management team/officers (several class action lawsuits were recently filed where plaintiffs have alleged the defendants knowingly/fraudulently inflated asset valuations of several of FSC's portfolio companies before FSAM's initial public offering). My BUY, SELL, or HOLD Recommendation: FSC recently closed at $6.31 per share as of 12/8/2015. This was a ($2.69) per share discount to FSC's NAV of $9.00 per share as of 9/30/2015. This calculates to a price to NAV ratio of 0.7007 or a discount of (29.93%). From the analysis provided above, including additional factors not analyzed within this article, I currently rate FSC as a SELL when the company's stock price is trading at less than a (25%) discount to NAV as of 9/30/2015, a HOLD when trading at or greater than a (25%) but less than a (35%) discount to NAV as of 9/30/2015, and a BUY when trading at or greater than a (35%) discount to NAV as of 9/30/2015. As such, I currently rate FSC as a HOLD. My current price target for FSC is $6.75 per share. While I believe the stock is fairly attractive at current valuations, I also believe the four cautionary/negative factors listed above will likely equate to a lack of notable price appreciation on the stock from current valuations. In addition, I anticipate continued volatility in markets due to speculation surrounding the timing of the Federal Open Market Committee's ("FOMC") initial increase to the Fed Funds Rate and recent global macroeconomic events (including the recent decrease in most commodity prices). If RiverNorth Capital is eventually successful in persuading FSAM/FSC to implement one or more recommended changes, I believe this should be seen as a positive catalyst and my recommendations would change accordingly.
