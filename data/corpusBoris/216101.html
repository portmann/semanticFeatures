The Winners And Losers From Canada's Federal Election, Part 1 | Seeking Alpha Cameron Conway , Follow me on Twitter (6 clicks) A new day dawns in Canada and investors look for the best options going forward. The construction sector and the coming infusion of federal funds. It has been a week since Canada has elected its first new government in a decade with the Liberal Party of Canada leaping from having the third most seats in Parliament to securing a majority government. Now that the confetti, speeches and shock have come to an end it is now time consider who the winners and the losers of this election are in the eyes of investors. For those south of the border a little bit of background information is in order. Unlike the United States which has a two party system comprised or right-wing Republicans and left-wing Democrats, Canada has a multi-party system with three primary national parties, and two lesser parties. The three main parties are the outgoing right-wing Conservative Party (formed by a merger of the Progressive Conservatives and Reform), then you have the left-wing New Democratic Party or the NDP (which has never formed a federal government) and finally you have the Liberal Party which tends to straddle the middle of the political landscape and cherry-pick from both ends depending on the cultural times and current political opposition. Understanding this difference between the Liberal Party of Canada and what is traditionally seen as liberal views in the United States should be taken into account as we explore the potential benefits and areas of concern investors should expect over the next four to five years. A core piece of the Liberals platform which helped it secure its majority was its promise to run a deficit of C$10 billion a year for the next couple of years with a balanced budget by year four of the government's mandate. The bulk of that C$10 billion a year in extra spending has been earmarked for infrastructure upgrades across the country. This ranges from rapid-transit, bridges and roads to subsidized housing and green energy infrastructure. When broken down the projected figures look like this. Some of the examples of potential spending which have already been hinted at includes C$20 billion in transit infrastructure spending ear-marked for the next 10 years and that Federal spending on public works will double to C$125 billion. Then there are the social infrastructure investments which have been announced which includes "investments into affordable housing, seniors' facilities, early learning and child care, and cultural and recreational infrastructure". These social infrastructure plans include "Prioritize significant new investments in affordable housing and seniors' facilities, starting with $6 billion in social infrastructure spending over next 4 years, with a total of $20 billion invested over the next decade" and "provide $125 million per year in tax incentives to increase and substantially renovate the supply of rental housing across Canada". Finally the green infrastructure plan currently includes "investments in local water and wastewater facilities; clean energy; climate resilient infrastructure, including flood mitigation systems; and infrastructure to protect against changing weather". The investment costs associated with these promises currently comes in at a price tag of C$6 billion over the next four years and C$20 billion over the next decade. Let's start with the transit portion of the coming Liberal spending spree and consider Winnipeg based New Flyer Industries (OTC: NFYEF ) which produces diesel, natural gas and electric transit buses. With transit (and especially rapid-transit) a key part of the Liberal infrastructure plan New Flyer should benefit from increased requirements for buses in many areas, Metro-Vancouver was one mentioned by name with proposed increased service in the Broadway corridor. New Flyer will also be able to ride the green infrastructure wave with its natural gas and electric engine options. New Flyer is already riding high thanks to its $477 million deal with the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority and has seen its TSX price target get bumped to C$19.00 compared to its Friday closing price on the TSX of C$19.23. New Flyer also offers an annualized dividend of C$0.62 with a yield of 3.22% and a P/E ratio of 22.89. With billions of infrastructure dollars coming into the market the companies which will benefit the most will be those in and around the construction sector, and with the recent layoffs of many in the oilsands there is an ample supply of available labour available. The question for investors becomes which aspect of the construction industry do they favor the most. For those interested in the supply aspect of construction Canam Group Inc. (OTC: CNMGF ) which manufactures steel components for the construction industry becomes one of your best options. Canam Group is no slouch in the industry rather this Montreal based company is North America's largest steel components fabricator and also offers virtual design and construction to building information modeling and outsourcing of technical drawings. Canam re-entered the headlines recently when it won a C$225 million bid to supply steel for the replacement of Canada's "busiest" bridge the Champlain Bridge in Montreal. Canam Group's place in the sector has helped push its average TSX price target to C$18.30 against a Friday closing price of C$14.68. Already being a continental leader in the steel industry and being headquartered in Prime Minister-elect Trudeau's home town of Montreal should help it secure its fair share of the coming spending spree. For investors Canam Group also offers a small annualized dividend of C$0.16 with a yield of 1.09%, however with a P/E ratio of 15.94 this stock is still quite affordable. If investing in the nuts and bolts of Canada's coming infrastructure boom isn't you cup of tea then we have the option of investing in engineering and planning firms. In this market sector we have three major players to choose from SNC-Lavalin Group (OTCPK: SNCAF ) Stantec Inc. (NASDAQ: SNC ) and WSP Global Inc. (OTCPK: WSPOF ). SNC-Lavalin was once a favorite among investors and serial-contractor with the government of Canada but various ethical and legal issues stemming from proven and accused acts of bribery have lessened SNC-Lavalin's clout globally. This includes already being excluded from World Bank sponsored projects for the next 10 years, and if convicted of bribery activities in Libya SNC-Lavalin will also face a 10 year ban from bidding on contracts offered by the Canadian government. Stantec does have a history with the Canadian government, with its development of Canada Posts' Postal Transformation Program, and the Canadian Museum of Human Rights along with a host of provincial and municipal projects. However the stock prior to the election was slipping and was in "sell" territory, since the election it has been upgraded to "hold". Last but not least is WSP Global Inc. another Montreal based engineering firm with perhaps the largest reach and influence of the three. WSP Global also should benefit greatly from the coming infrastructure spending with its deep roots in municipal development which should generate opportunities in the transit and social infrastructure projects but also has a portfolio of water and waste projects which should put it into contention for green infrastructure projects also. For investors WSP Global has just received an added boost to its operations now that it has closed its C$425 million acquisition of MMM which is one of the largest privately-owned engineering consultancies in Canada. While each of these three engineering offers different strengths and problems this chart should help investors narrow down their best option. In parts two and three we will go over some of the unexpected winners of the Liberal victory and reveal the losers of this election going forward.
