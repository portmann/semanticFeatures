Fitch: Australia Fiscal Plan Weakens, But Core Strengths Intact | Reuters (The following statement was released by the rating agency) HONG KONG/SINGAPORE, May 13 (Fitch) Australia's Commonwealth budget, released on  12 May 2015, highlights the continued weakening of the country's long-term  fiscal consolidation plans, but does not fundamentally alter the core factors  supporting Australia's 'AAA' rating, says Fitch Ratings. These include low  debt-to-GDP versus ratings peers, a stable banking system and a credible fiscal  policy framework.  Deterioration in the fiscal outlook since the last budget was widely expected  alongside the continued weakening of labour market conditions and a tepid  recovery in commodity prices that has not brought prices back to levels seen  before the downturn.  The fiscal cash deficit widened and government debt projections increased in the  fiscal year ending 30 June 2016 (FY16) budget, reflecting in part the  deterioration in economic growth dynamics linked to the fall in commodity prices  and slowdown in China. Falling terms of trade have impacted long-term revenue  growth projections, which have been revised down to 6.3% annually to 2018 from  6.6% at the last economic and fiscal update. Wage growth and corporate income  will continue to be challenged by lower commodity prices, resulting in AUD20bn  less in tax revenues over the coming four years compared with the outlook in the  2014 budget.     The deteriorating cash balance also reflects higher spending forecasts compared  to the government's Mid-year Economic and Fiscal Outlook in December.   The government still aims to return to a balanced budget by FY20 - even though  fiscal consolidation plans have weakened. It is notable though that with a  three-year federal election cycle - the next election is due by January 2017 -  there remains significant uncertainty as to whether the political commitment to  achieve this target will be sustained. Nonetheless, Australia does benefit from  a credible policy framework and Fitch expects Australia to continue to have a  significantly lower debt burden than its 'AAA'-rated peers - general government  debt was 31.8% of GDP in 2014 versus the 'AAA' median of 41.3%. Notably too, the  government forecasts debt-to-GDP to begin falling by FY18 after rising for the  next two fiscal years. As such, the budget should not have a significant effect  on Australia's existing strong credit profile.  Fitch believes that the iron ore forecast price in the budget of USD48/tonne  seems a reasonable base case, but the budget will remain sensitive to further  price falls. Australia's dependence on commodity exports, especially to China,  indicates that the sovereign may need a slightly larger buffer in its public  finances than some of its peers at the 'AAA' level.  Over the longer term, reducing Australia's dependence on commodities would  mitigate a key vulnerability of the economy and sovereign. The FY16 budget  includes some policy measures, including infrastructure investments and targeted  SME tax cuts, to raise potential growth and spur service sector exports. As yet,  it is uncertain to what extent these sorts of policies will be successful in  transitioning growth away from mining.
