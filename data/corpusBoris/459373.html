More thanÂ two years ago, the Harvard economist and former U.S. Treasury secretary resurrected the Depression-era phrase â€œsecular stagnationâ€? to describe a chronic deficiency of investment relative to savings that has trapped the world in a state ofÂ low economic growth largely resistant to monetary policy. Events since have strengthened Mr. Summersâ€™s case. Growth projections have been repeatedly downgraded and expected inflation and bond yields have ground lower. Formerly skeptical economists are less so: Both the International Monetary Fund and the Federal Reserve have implicitly warmed toÂ Mr. Summersâ€™s thesis. With yields taking another leg down after Britainâ€™s vote to leave the European Union, the evidence ofÂ secular stagnation, Mr. Summers says, is stronger than ever . If he’s right, the world needs a contingency plan. The most direct response is more expansionary fiscal policy (i.e. lower taxes or higher spending), which would bolster demand and push interest rates up. But policy makers are rightfully wary about acting in the face of so manyÂ contradictory signals. In the U.S., unemployment is moving lower and stocks are hitting new highs. Bonds could be pricing in secular stagnation, or merely a greater bias toward hyper-stimulative monetary policy by central banks. What policy makers need, then, is a plan that works if Mr. Summers is right, but has few downside consequences ifÂ he is wrong. TheÂ good news is that low interest rates make government debt more sustainable. This week, the Congressional Budget Office concluded that debt would be 14 percentage points lower as a share of GDP by 2046 than it thought in January because of lower interest rates. By my back-of-the-envelope calculations, if interest rates, growth and inflation continue around todayâ€™s levels over the next decade, the deficit would average 3.2% of GDP, instead of the 3.9% the CBO projected in January. That fiscal room should not be wasted. Persuading Congress to raise the deficit wonâ€™t be hard. Democrats want to expand entitlements, Republicans to cut taxes. Both are risky: They stimulate the economy in the short run but are difficult to undo in the long run. IfÂ growth, inflation and interest rates return to normal, the U.S. would have lost itsÂ fiscal room while locking in a larger deficit. If the problem turns out not to be lack of demand but lack of supply (i.e. innovation, productivity and population growth) deficits will be higher with no sustainable boost to growth. Paulo Mauro of the Peterson Institute for International Economics notes that countries have often overestimated their long-term potential growth , resulting in too-high deficits and debts. ToÂ maximize benefits and minimize costs, fiscal stimulus should directly address supply-side constraints on economic growth and not be permanent. This points to investment in public infrastructure . Highways, airports and municipal water systems are wearing out or at capacity so rehabilitating them helps both demand and supply. Maybe the return on public capital isnâ€™t as high as fans claim, but as Mr. Summers regularly notes, it’s got to look better whenÂ borrowing costs are around zero. A public-works program could deliver years of added demand without becoming a permanent addition to the federal budget.Â Moreover, the borrowing can be repaid with either taxes or politically more palatable user fees, so long as the spending happens now and the payback takes decades. The biggest hurdle to infrastructure as stimulus are the countless bureaucratic and logistical hurdles. Public consultations, tendering processes, environmental and engineering studies can drag on for years. Mr. Summers and Rachel Lipson, a Harvard student, investigated the case of a bridge over the Charles River Â inÂ Boston. Four years after rehabilitation began, it is over budget and 22 months behind schedule. Among the reasons: adhering to strict historical requirements; the need to relocate a water main after construction had already started; and a redesign in 2014 to make possible a future pedestrian underpass. The subway in Washington, D.C., has suffered repeated breakdowns, accidents and fires, sapping productivity and patience for millions. Yet it is actually underspending its capital budget because it canâ€™t execute its own plans. This means ifÂ policy makers are going to have the option of fiscal stimulus, they need a comprehensive infrastructure-investment plan now that prioritizes projects by potential productivity payoff and speed of approval. That would be better than wasting money ifÂ stimulus doesn’t prove necessary, or doing nothing if it does. Is â€˜Secular Stagnationâ€™ Too Pessimistic?
