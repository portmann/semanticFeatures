The Budget the Next President Will Inherit, in Five Charts - Real Time Economics - WSJ President Barack Obama released his final budget Tuesday, the primary purpose of which is to lay out his priorities for his remaining year in office. With few major budgeting changes likely in the president’s final year in office, the document also provides a fascinating look at what the next president will inherit. The next president will take office with spending outpacing revenue, but within ranges that have been typical over the past 50 years. Federal government expenditures today, as a share of the overall economy, are much larger than they were in the 1930s, and somewhat larger than in the 1950s. Revenues are more or less where they’ve been in recent decades. Obviously, expenditures are nothing like they were during World War II. Zooming in just on the past 50 years, the shifting patterns are a little bit easier to see. Neither federal revenues nor expenditures have been below 14% of the economy Â or above 25%, so only this range is pictured. Government revenues have mostly hovered between 17% and 19% of GDP. They were slightly higher in the late 1990s when the economy was booming andÂ lower following the recessions of 2001 and 2007-09. Variation from one year to the next is largely driven by the health of the economy. Revenues climb when the economy is strong (more people earning more money means more tax revenue) and plunge during periods of job loss. Government spending soared in 2008 and 2009, in response to the recession. While some of this is the result of the president’s and Congress’s policies attempting to boost the economy, it’s worth keeping in mind that much of this happens automatically as spending on unemployment and safety-net programs rises. The difference between spending and revenue is the federal deficit. Aside from a few years during the booming economy of the late 1990s, it’s been negative for most of the past 50 years. Without major policy changes or a jolt to the economy, the next president will inherit a deficit of just over 2% of gross domestic productâ€”neither exceptionally high or exceptionally low in comparison to recent decades. While the next president may take office amid moderate deficits, he or she will face a hefty legacy of debt. Total government debt is now above 100% of GDP. It’s worth keeping in mind, however, that large amounts of this debt are owed to other arms of the federal government, mainly the Social Security trust fund. The Federal Reserve also owns a large portion of Treasury bonds that it uses to conduct monetary policies. The publicâ€”that is, investors both foreign and domesticâ€”own the remaining debt that amounts to about 60% of GDP. While the government performs an incredibly wide array of functions, most of the government’s budget goes to a small number of places. In fact, the combined budgets of every single cabinet agency except for Treasury, Defense and Health and Human Services amount to less than 20%â€”and shrinkingâ€”of the government’s spending. Most of the spending in the Treasury Department goes to paying interest on the government’s debt, so there’s not much a future president can do with that chunk of the budget. Most Health and Human Services spending goes to Medicare and Medicaid. Making any dent in that would require a significant legislative revamping of those programs. Finally, most of the budget that’s not accounted for in this chart (the white space up top) goes to Social Security, a notoriously difficult program to overhaul. So the reality that the winning candidate will face in January 2017 is this:Â moderate deficits, the largest accumulated debt since World War II, and a budget that is almost entirely claimed by defense, interest payments, Social Security and Medicare.
