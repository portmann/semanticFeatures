Pairing Emerging And High Yield International Infrastructure ETFs: A Unique Global Investment - iShares S&P Emerging Markets Infrastructure Index ETF (NASDAQ:EMIF) | Seeking Alpha Jun.  4, 2015 12:36 PM ET  |  About: iShares S&P Emerging Markets Infrastructure Index ETF (EMIF) , GHII by: George Fisher Pairing EMIF and GHII provides a 3.5% yield and an almost 50% - 50% emerging -developed market exposure for a healthier global allocation. The four top countries would be China and Brazil with 36% of assets combined and US and Australia with 20% of assets combined. Sector exposure would be 42% Utilities, 40% Transportation and Industrials, and 18% Energy, but the combination lacks diversification beyond these four sectors. SA is offering a contest of articles paring one investment sell with another buy, but my offering is to pair one buy with another buy. An important theme today is global diversification, with many calling for Europe and Asia to offer better investment returns than the US. My suggestion incorporates an acceptable dividend into the total return equation and uses the diversity of an ETF to gain exposure in a tricky investment area - international infrastructure. Pairing equal investment capital in the iShares S&P Emerging Markets Infrastructure Index ETF (NASDAQ: EMIF ) and the Guggenheim S&P High Income Infrastructure ETF (NYSEARCA: GHII ) generates international income from utilities, energy, transportation, and industrial stocks. Combined, these two ETFs hold 80 dividend paying stocks covering emerging and developed market exposure. There is no overlap of positions, which make this pairing an advantage. However, with exposure to only four industrial sectors, diversification is not as extensive as other global ETFs. EMIF invests in 30 of the largest emerging market equities in the infrastructure industry and are components of S&P Emerging Markets Infrastructure Index. The index rebalances semiannually in March and October. The ETF started in 2009. GHII invests in 50 stocks that comprise the S&P High Income Infrastructure Index. The index rebalances semiannually in June and December. GHII recently launched in Feb 2015. EMIF current yield is 2.87% and is trading in the middle of its 52-week range. GHII has an anticipated yield of 4.1% and has a short trading history. According to etfdb.com, EMIF has $78 million in assets vs GHII's $178 million, and both are tiny compared to other utility and infrastructure ETFs. EMIF has an average daily volume of 12,000 shares while GHII has a daily average volume under 1,000 shares. EMIF carries a reasonable PE ratio of 12.2 while GHII's is much higher at 19.7. EMIF collects fees of 0.75% vs GHII at 0.45%. The top 10 positions comprise 58% of EMIF' assets and 45% of GHII's assets. Following the allocation goal, EMIF's sector exposure is Transportation & Industrials 43%, Utilities 39%, and Energy 17%. Below is a graph of county and region exposure with emerging countries in Asia and Latin America leading with a combined 85%. China (41%) and Brazil (20%) are the top two countries. A list of EMIF holdings and other information is offered at etfdb.com . More information on the selection process of components to the S&P Emerging Markets Infrastructure Index can be found here : All stocks in the Investable Universe are classified as being in one of three clusters: Energy, Transportation or Utilities. The six largest eligible Energy stocks, 12 largest eligible Transportation stocks and 12 largest eligible Utilities are incorporated into the Index. Following the allocation goal, GHII's sector exposure is Transportation & Industrials 39%, Utilities 46%, and Energy 19%. Below is a graph of county and region exposure with developed countries in Europe, U.S. and Australia leading with a combined 73%. The U.S. (19%) and Australia (19%) are the top two countries. A list of holdings and other information can also be found at etfdb.com More information on the methodology criteria and selection process of components to the S&P High Income Infrastructure Index can be found here : The index is designed to measure and monitor the performance of fifty high-yielding global equity securities of companies that engage in various infrastructure-related sub-industries. Index constituents must meet size, listing and liquidity requirements and also be part of the S&P Global BMI Index, which is a rules-based index that measures global stock market performance. The investment thesis for pairing these two is to gain international exposure, to focus on much needed infrastructure investments globally, and to offer an acceptable yield from international dividends. The paired yield would be 3.5% and the average fee would be 0.60%. In addition, the paring adds diversification of both emerging and developed markets, reducing the risk usually associated with emerging markets and adding more growth than typically found in developed markets. The combined exposure by region would be balanced between developed and emerging markets with an almost 50% - 50% split. China and Brazil are still the largest holdings, but their importance falls to 25.5% and 10.0% of assets, respectively, with the US at 9.5% and Australia at 9.5%. These four countries comprise 55% of assets. Below is a list of the combined region exposure: Of these top 20 holdings, toll roads and airports are the most prevalent, followed in order by electric utilities, ocean ports and shipping, natural gas pipelines and midstream assets, gas distribution, and energy services. The listed holdings represent 53% of the combined assets of EMIF and GHII. Pairing these two investments will create a custom combination that neither can offer on its own, that is global in nature, with the advantages of emerging market growth and developed market stability, and that offers an acceptable yield. In addition, it is incredibly easy to implement this strategy to gain added international exposure in a higher yield, more stable portfolio than many other international ETFs. More information on GHII can be found in a previous Seeking Alpha article published here . I have been an investor in EMIF for several years and bought GHII last March after its debut. The investment thesis of this paring was offered as a shortened version in the June issue of Guiding Mast Investments.
