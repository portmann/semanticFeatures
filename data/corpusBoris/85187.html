Strong Retail And Inventory Levels Point To Strong U.S. Economic Momentum | Seeking Alpha Consumers picked up spending in May 2015 with 1.2% increase in spending as the environment of better wages gain traction. Businesses predicted this upturn and increased their inventory by 0.4% back in April when data shows that spending was flat before it was revised upwards to 0.2%. Retailers who are closer to their consumers led the inventory buildup by 0.8%, followed by the 0.4% of wholesome retailers and 0.1% inventory growth by manufacturers. Both retail spending and inventory levels point unmistakably to the recovery of the US economy. USD strengthen slightly as both report were released on June 11. However this requires confirmation by the FOMC on June 17 and USD is prone to periodic weakness. Long term bullish on USD. If you referred to my previous article on the USD, titled Strong Jobs Opening And Small Business Optimism Forms Basis For USD Strength , you would have noticed my assessment of the cautious nature of the USD in response to good economic news. I had mentioned that the USD is waiting for the retail sales result and the June FOMC statement next week before making a decisive move. As of today, we have the results of retail data had been released and this means that half of the restraint on the USD is now gone. We shall look at the results of May 2015 retail spending today together with the latest inventory levels and assess its impact on the economy and the USD. The April retail spending remained flat at 0.0% which added to the general gloom of the USD last month as the labor market added lesser than expected new positions. This was in addition to the slightly weaker industrial production and capacity utilization rate. The Census Bureau adjusted April retail spending from 0.0% to 0.2% on more comprehensive data. The Census Bureau reported that the US spent $444.9 billion for retail and food services for the month of May alone. This is 1.2% higher than the previous month and 2.7% from May 2014. A deeper look into the Census Bureau report shows that May had a broad based recovery in consumer spending. There was an increase in 11 out of 13 categories of spending from clothing to furniture to automobiles. This good news is important as consumer spending accounts for 70% of the GDP. This shows that consumers are more confident about the economic recovery. This would boost the economic recovery on its own as their spending would boost the overall income of the economy. This would be a result of the tightening labor market which are forcing employers to increase the wages of its workers. As more money lands in the hands of consumers, they are spending after taking a break in April. It would appear that businesses had the foresight to predict the increased willingness of consumers to spend back in April when consumers were taking a break. They have responded by increasing the inventory held as the Census Bureau . Businesses as a whole, increased their inventory by 0.4% from March 2015 to April 2015. Mass retailers are at the forefront of consumer spending and they were the most agile. They responded by increasing inventory by 0.8% in April 2015 versus the month before, while wholesale retailers increased their inventory by 0.4% and followed by manufacturers who increased their inventory by 0.1%. Another way where we can approach this business optimism study would be to take a look at the inventory to sales ratio. When businesses are more optimistic that they will sell more in the following month, it would spend more to add on more inventory. The chart above shows that from mid 2014 onwards, businesses as a whole have increased their inventory in response to the rapidly recovering economy. We can see that this ratio is sensitive to economic condition. It plunged in response to the Great Recession but it has been on a steady recovery since 2010. This chart hints that a robust recovery had been in the making for at least 5 years and the end of QE in October 2014 did not affect the economy adversely. In fact, the economy took off which is testimonial to the Fed's stewardship of the economy. The May retail spending data and April inventory levels data both support the theme that the US economy is on a steady path of recovery. As consumers are willing to spend more, businesses would have to take on more workers to produce more and this would increase the production and income of the entire economy. It would appear that the April 2015 decline in spending is a one-off event and consumers are now more willing to spend on greater confidence on the economy. It is clear that growth momentum is picking up for the US economy and it is a matter of time before inflation follows. This would likely to lead the Fed to have a more bullish assessment of the economy in its June 17 FOMC Statement next week. As of now, the USD as seen in the PowerShares DB USD Bull ETF (NYSEARCA: UUP ), had shown sign of bullishness as seen in the chart below. The market would be waiting for the FOMC Statement on June 17 for their formal assessment of the strength of the US economy. This would be the ultimate indicator of the long awaited liftoff of the current zero interest rate environment. I am still bullish of the USD over the long term on the back of a stronger economy but the USD is still prone to periodic weakness as we approach the big FOMC day.
