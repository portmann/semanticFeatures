He taught political science as the graduate and undergraduate level and blogs regularly at Corrente , Firedoglake and New Economic Perspectives . Jointly published with New Economic Perspectives Most of the world, and most notably the United States, is in the grip of fiscal myths fostered by the ideology of neoliberalism. There is virtual unanimity across the major political parties in the United States in accepting the viewpoint of neoliberalism, and the fiscal myths associated with it. This book is about these myths, the arguments showing that they are, indeed, myths, and the truths that can counter them. It is about Campaign 2016, and some of its issues, because the fiscal myths will certainly be used in the Campaign; since, for the first time in a very long time, there is a major party candidate running, who, because he advocates for a very broad agenda and for fighting inequality, will, sooner or later, find that some, and perhaps a large number, of fiscal myths are being directed at him by his opponents and their supporters, who want to persuade voters that his agenda is â€œfiscally irresponsible.â€? The process of using fiscal myths to undermine Senator Sandersâ€™s message has already begun with an attack by Laura Meckler of the Wall Street Journal on key elements of his program. The attack was easily turned aside by progressive supporters, such as Gerald Friedman, who showed that the fiscal proposals being criticized as â€œfiscally irresponsibleâ€? were sure to net save at least $5 Trillion, rather than cost $18 Trillion over a decade, as the WSJ was claiming, because they would replace current expensive programs, and deliver huge out of pocket savings for Americans. His views were particularly effective because the WSJ had relied on his study for the data informing its critique. Apart from Friedmanâ€™s decisive critique of Mecklerâ€™s article other notable instances of progressive pushback came quickly from James Kwak, Robert Reich, Joshua Holland, Matthew Yglesias, John T. Harvey, (who alone brought a Modern Money Theory (MMT) perspective to the debate), and John Geyman. An important characteristic of the defenses of the Sanders agenda, with the exception of John Harveyâ€™s, is their emphasis on the point that we can afford Bernieâ€™s agenda because it pays for itself with increased tax revenues from various sources. These defenses are within the neoliberal framework and reinforce that framework. They pay silent homage to the fiscal myth that the Government can only get money to pay for programs by taxing or borrowing, and that this is important because the Federal Government, like a household, a State Government, and all private organizations have Government Budget Constraints (GBCs). Attacks on other proposed fiscal policies on the Senator’s agenda in the infrastructure, climate protection and job creation areas are sure to intensify in the coming weeks and months as these policy proposals get increasing exposure and scrutiny. Critics will say that the likelihood is high that policies in these areas, will require substantial deficit spending, and increases in the national debt, and also that deficit reduction and deficit neutrality should be targeted as the first principle of responsible fiscal policy outweighing all other considerations. But this assumption belongs to a constellation of fiscal myths that are all false. Nonetheless, as Campaign 2016 develops, faux fiscal responsibility deficit and debt memes, fueled by a chorus of think tanks where the Very Serious People (VSP) sit and talk only to one another, will take center stage in political debates. At that point, mainstream critics in the media will use these myths to whip the Sanders proposals unmercifully as the ravings of a â€œpie in the skyâ€? â€œsocialistâ€? who knows nothing about public finance and the need for fiscal responsibility. Rather than wait for those attacks, I decided that this book was needed to answer them now; by unmasking the myths, and offering truths to counter them. In the end, it will be point and counter-point that will supplement the Senatorâ€™s moral vision and moral appeals for certain critically important policies with new fiscal frames, memes, and truths capable of blunting the attacks, and giving people a reason to believe that those offering the old fiscal frames, memes, and myths are giving them a tired old line that has long outlived its usefulness, if it has ever had any at all since 1971. This book analyzes and rejects numerous fiscal myths in these categories. Myths about: â€œRunning Out of Moneyâ€?; Government Debt; the â€œBurden of Government Debtâ€?; the Government â€œFamilyâ€? or â€œHousehold;â€?; â€œSpending Too Much,â€? Inflation, and Hyper-inflation; â€œShared Sacrificeâ€? and â€œGovernment Austerityâ€?; â€œOur Economic Futureâ€?; â€œMoneyâ€?; and â€œFiscal Responsibilityâ€?; and concludes with a comparison of â€œFiscal Myths and Fiscal Truthsâ€?. During the next six months and beyond, many of us will be called upon to defend the Senatorâ€™s program by trying to banish the deficit/debt myths, memes, frames and Gods from respectable public discourse on social media. It will once again be social media vs. the mainstream media, in an effort to crack the mainstream phalanx of conventional opinion, and make its leaders, at long last, think about real issues. This book aims to make a contribution to that task and to help in the great effort to overcome the candidates of the developing oligarchy in both parties in Campaign 2016.

Who would have thought that blogging power, and the considerable efforts of a few non mainstream economists, would start to raise the fog? NC has gone where no other site has gone to explode the myths of capitalism, the ‘killing for money’ that goes on day by day. And now that we have overextended our borrowings to fund normal government expenditures like health, welfare and education, we have a budget problem that the people must accept.  Lower services and incomes, higher taxes, selling assets.  All so that we can pay investors who lent money to our governments.  (It’s governments that borrow, not countries.) The lie that a government needs taxes so that it can spend on services is becoming mainstream.  I applaud every link and will share will my own concerned friends.

I guess the bottom line for the electorate is you are a citizen of the richest country on the planet – there is no way the government ‘can’t afford’ to make things better for you. They made it better for the banks, didn’t they? Any argument about ‘can’t afford’ is essentially a lie. allan on Links 10/23/15 Valeantâ€™s looming M&A hiatus deals blow to investment...
