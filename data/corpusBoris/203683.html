Prospect Capital Corp.'s Results For Fiscal Q4 2015 - My Assessment - Prospect Capital Corporation (NASDAQ:PSEC) | Seeking Alpha On 8/26/2015, PSEC reported results for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015. The company reported NII of $0.249 per share, earnings of $0.264 per share, net ICTI of $0.268 per share, and NAV of $10.31 per share as of 6/30/2015. In this assessment article, I will summarize my previous account projections versus actual results. During this assessment, several topics in relation to PSEC's quarterly results will be discussed. My buy, sell, or hold recommendation for PSEC is stated in the "Conclusions Drawn" section at the end of the article. On 8/26/2015, Prospect Capital Corp. (NASDAQ: PSEC ) reported net investment income ("NII") of $0.249 per share, net assets resulting from operations (also known as EPS) of $0.264 per share, net ICTI of $0.268 per share, and net asset value ("NAV") of $10.31 per share as of 6/30/2015. In my prior PSEC fiscal Q4 2015 NII and NAV projection article , I projected the company would report quarterly NII of $0.246 per share, EPS of $0.202 per share, net ICTI of $0.264 per share, and NAV of $10.25 per share as of 6/30/2015. As such, the company's NII was "as expected" when compared to my projections while its EPS figure was a modest outperformance. When calculated, my NII, net ICTI, and NAV projections had a variance of ($0.003), ($0.004), and ($0.062) per share, respectively. All these projections were well within my stated range. I will now summarize my prior article's account projections and compare each account to PSEC's actual results. To begin this discussion, Table 1 is provided below. Table 1 shows my prior account projections, which were referenced in the linked article above, and compares these figures to the company's actual results for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015. I also have included PSEC's actual results for the fiscal first, second, and third quarters of 2015 to provide readers additional clarity/comparisons between quarters. Source: Table created entirely by myself, partially using PSEC data obtained from the SEC's EDGAR database In my prior PSEC NII and NAV projection article (link provided above), I stated the company's total investment portfolio would increase approximately $25 million for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015 (prior to all quarterly "fair market value" ("FMV") fluctuations and scheduled principal payments). PSEC reported loan originations and add-on investments of $460 million while having portfolio sales/repayments/restructurings of ($438) million. When calculated, the company had a total investment portfolio increase of $22 million for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015 (again, prior to all quarterly FMV fluctuations and scheduled principal payments), which was extremely close to my projection of $25 million. Using Table 1 above as a reference, I projected Prospect Capital would report "total interest income" of $185.4 million for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015. In comparison, PSEC reported total interest income of $191.0 million, which was slightly above my projection, but well within my stated range. Part of the slight outperformance for this figure was due to the fact the company had several debt investments which had amended interest rates. One such investment was "National Property REIT Corp." ("NPH"). Within this control investment, two of PSEC's senior secured term loans to "ACL Loan Holdings, Inc." ("ACL") had increased "payment-in-kind" ("PIK") interest rates which became effective during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015. This ultimately resulted in the company recording additional interest income within its control investment portfolio during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015. Moving down the accounts within Table 1, PSEC's dividend and structuring/fee income were very close to what I projected. I projected the company would report dividend and structuring/fee income of $2.0 million and $6.0 million, respectively. In comparison, the company reported dividend and structuring/fee income of $2.1 and $5.7 million, respectively. Both figures were well within my stated range. Still using Table 1 above as a reference, I projected PSEC would report total operating expenses of $105.1 million for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015. In comparison, it reported total expenses of $109.3 million. When calculated, this came out to be a variance of ($4.2) million, which was a slightly higher amount when compared to my projections. However, this was well within my stated range as well. This minor variance was mainly attributed to a slightly higher-than-anticipated interest expense and allocation of company overhead amounts. PSEC also recorded a minor excise tax for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015. The way I usually prepare my projections, I typically ensure if a company has a higher reported income figure when compared to my projections, the company would also generally have a higher expense figure as well. As such, when PSEC's total income and total expense figures are combined, the "net effect" would be offsetting variances. This quarter was no exception. Moving towards the bottom of Table 1, I projected NII of $88.3 million for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015 while PSEC reported NII of $89.5 million. When calculated, its reported NII was only $1.2 million above my projection. Again, this was well within my stated range, and there was nothing materially "surprising" about any of the accounts reported within PSEC's NII. I believe the company's investment portfolio, as a whole, modestly outperformed my expectations, which ultimately led to the company reporting EPS of $0.264 per share when compared to my projected EPS of $0.202 per share. This directly led to Prospect reporting a NAV of $10.31 per share while I projected the company would report NAV of $10.25 per share. However, a variance of $0.06 per share was still well within my stated range. This has now been the sixth consecutive quarter where I have provided an accurate PSEC NAV per share projection. My quarterly PSEC NAV per share projection for the fiscal third and fourth quarters of 2014 had a variance of $0.01 and $0.00 per share, respectively. My quarterly PSEC NAV per share projection for the fiscal first, second, third, and fourth quarters of 2015 had a variance of $0.01, $0.01, $0.03, and $0.06 per share, respectively. Within my profile here at Seeking Alpha, I have provided the links to the prior PSEC articles where these projections were originally stated. Continuing to move down Table 1, I projected PSEC would report a net loss on the extinguishment of debt of ($2.6) million for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015 while the company reported a net loss of ($2.7) million. Mainly due to Prospect's restructuring of the company's investment in Edmentum, Inc. (Edmentum), PSEC reported a net realized loss of ($29.5) million for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015. This was basically an exact match to my projected net realized loss of ($30.0) million. The only account that had a modest variance to my projections was PSEC's "unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments" account. I projected PSEC would report net unrealized appreciation of $17.0 million regarding its combined investment portfolio for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015. However, PSEC reported a somewhat surprising (and encouraging) net unrealized appreciation of $37.4 million for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015. As such, its investment portfolio recorded additional appreciation of approximately $20 million when compared to my projections. As I researched PSEC's quarterly unrealized appreciation (depreciation) fluctuations, I noticed this variance was mainly attributed to the company's valuation of "Harbortouch Payments, LLC" (Harbortouch) as of 6/30/2015. During the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015, PSEC recorded unrealized appreciation of $40.8 million on Harbortouch. While I anticipated an unrealized appreciation within Harbortouch of $15-$20 million during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015, PSEC's actual unrealized appreciation was basically double my projection. While I haven't read the company's entire annual SEC filing (From 10-K for the year-ending 6/30/2015), I believe discussing this material appreciation within Harbortouch should be addressed by the analysts/management during the company's earnings conference call. In my professional opinion, all these projections should be considered close to actual results due to the complex FMV methodologies of level 3 assets per Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 820. I also believe it should be noted these types of projection articles are typically provided before any company in the sector reports. However, with that being said, PSEC's NII and NAV projection analysis for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015 was provided after all other business development companies ("BDC") reported earnings. This is due to the fact PSEC's fiscal-year end is June 30th of a given year and the company takes a longer period of time to file its annual report (via Form 10-K). Since a company's operating performance (quarterly earnings) is one of the key drivers to stock price valuations, I believe these types of projection/assessment articles I provide are highly appreciated by some investors. Most reader feedback, via both public and private correspondence, has continued to support this notion. I believe PSEC's results for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015 were slightly above my expectations. NII met my expectations while the FMV fluctuations on the company's investment portfolio were modestly above my expectations. In particular, the $40.8 million of unrealized appreciation within Harbortouch was nearly double my projection for this portfolio company. In my opinion, the following positive factors should be highlighted for existing and potential PSEC shareholders: 1) Continued quarterly economic returns are still being generated; 2) eventual unhindered expansion of CLO, online lending, and real estate investments through spin-offs; 3) recent net ICTI per share figures in excess of the newly declared dividend per share rate; 4) continued modest to material FMV appreciation on several control and CLO investments; 5) recent gradual increase of the company's annualized weighted average yield on its debt investments; 6) recent decrease in the company's weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings; and 7) recent utilization of share buybacks when the company is trading at an excessively material discount to current NAV. However, the following cautionary/negative factors should cause heightened awareness for existing and potential PSEC shareholders: 1) Continued suppressed dividend and structuring/fee income being generated; 2) continued modest to material depreciation on several control/non-control investments (will be further discussed in a future article); 3) Prospect Capital Management L.P.'s stance regarding not amending its Investment Advisory Agreement with the company; and 4) continued modest exposure to the oil and gas sector (high probability of modest depreciation occurring during the fiscal first quarter of 2016). PSEC recently closed at $7.04 per share as of 8/26/2015. This was a ($3.27) per share discount to PSEC's NAV of $10.31 per share as of 6/30/2015. This calculates to a price-to-NAV ratio of 0.6827 or a discount of (31.73%). As such, for investors with a higher risk tolerance, I currently rate PSEC as a BUY. I believe a material portion of the risk associated with PSEC's investment portfolio is already priced into the stock valuation. It should be noted this recommendation is based on a "long-term" time horizon (an outlook of at least one year). For "short-term" investors (an outlook of under one year), I anticipate continued volatility in markets due to speculation surrounding the timing of the Federal Open Market Committee's ("FOMC") initial increase to the Fed Funds Rate (which impacts LIBOR), recent global macroeconomic events, and the recent rather sharp drop in crude oil prices. With that being said, on 3/10/2015 Prospect Yield Corp., LLC (PSEC's recently-formed, wholly-owned subsidiary; PYLD) filed a registration statement with the SEC thus moving the company's previously announced CLO "spin-off" forward (via a "rights offering"). Details are still not available to the public regarding which specific CLO investments will remain with PYLD or be transferred to PSEC should the spin-off be finalized. On 5/6/2015, Prospect Realty Income Trust Corp. ("PRIT") and Prospect Finance Company ("PFAN") filed confidential registration statements to the SEC to enable PSEC to sell its interests in PRIT and PFAN pursuant to a rights offering. These three rights offerings would have a direct, material impact on PSEC's future earnings and operations. As such, for investors with a lower risk tolerance, I would continue to wait to initiate a position in PSEC until more specific information is provided regarding the company's potential/pending spin-offs. A detailed analysis of PSEC's investment portfolio will be provided in a future article. Within this future article, I will also discuss the company's updated oil and gas exposure, future investment portfolio strategies, future debt financing, and dividend considerations.
