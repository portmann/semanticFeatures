Prospect Capital Corp.'s Dividend And NAV Sustainability Analysis (Post Fiscal Q2 2015 Earnings) - Part 1 - Prospect Capital Corporation (NASDAQ:PSEC) | Seeking Alpha Part 1 of this article analyzes PSEC's current dividend sustainability by performing four tests based on recent quarterly results. The first two tests analyze PSEC's NII and the company's cumulative undistributed NII, which are based on GAAP methodologies. The next two tests analyze the company's net ICTI and cumulative UTI, which are based on IRC methodologies. Summarized results from the four tests performed within this analysis, in regards to PSEC's current dividend sustainability, are stated within the "Conclusions Drawn" section of the article. Part 2 will discuss some additional topics/trends to consider in a general net rising interest rate environment regarding PSEC's future dividend and NAV sustainability. Author's Note: This two-part article is a very detailed look at Prospect Capital Corp.'s (NASDAQ: PSEC ) dividend and net asset value ("NAV") sustainability. I perform this detailed analysis for readers who anticipate/want such an analysis performed (which has increased, from recent reader feedback). For readers who just want the summarized conclusions/results, I would suggest to scroll down to the "Conclusions Drawn" section at the bottom of each part of the article. The focus of PART 1 of this article is to provide a detailed analysis with supporting documentation (via four tests) on the current dividend sustainability of PSEC. This analysis will be provided after a brief overview of PSEC's regulated investment company ("RIC") classification, per the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC"). After the discussion of this topic, I will be performing four dividend sustainability tests within PART 1 of this article. The first two tests will focus on PSEC's net investment income ("NII"). These two tests will be termed "TEST 1" and "TEST 2". The next two tests will focus on PSEC's net investment company taxable income ("ICTI"). These two tests will be termed "TEST 3" and "TEST 4". At the end of PART 1 of this article, there will be a conclusion based on the results obtained from TEST 1, TEST 2, TEST 3, and TEST 4 about the current dividend sustainability of PSEC. PART 2 transitions to a more "forward-looking" dividend sustainability analysis, and will discuss some topics/trends to consider in a general net rising interest rate environment that may counter (or confirm) the evidence obtained within PART 1. PART 2 will also perform an analysis of PSEC's future NAV sustainability. At the end of this two-part article, I will provide my projection regarding PSEC's dividend per share rate for May 2015 and June 2015. I will also provide my projection regarding PSEC's NAV per share range over the next several fiscal quarters. I am writing this particular article due to the continued high demand that such an analysis be performed. Understanding the tax and dividend payout characteristics of PSEC will provide investors with an overall better understanding of the business development company ("BDC") sector as a whole. After reading this article, investors will better understand how an RIC (per the IRC) comes up with the company's current dividend rate, and specific signs when an impending dividend raise or cut would be implemented. Side Note: It should be noted PSEC's fiscal year-end, based on generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), is June 30th of a given year. In contrast, the company's tax year-end, based on IRC methodologies, is August 31st of a given year. Readers should understand there is a two-month "gap" per se between PSEC's GAAP fiscal year-end and the company's IRC tax year-end when the analysis is presented below. Brief Discussion of PSEC's RIC Classification per the IRC: In prior PSEC articles, I have discussed the company's RIC classification per the IRC in detail. This included specific provisions that PSEC must adhere by to remain in RIC compliance. There is one specific provision relative to the company's dividend sustainability analysis. PSEC is required to distribute to shareholders at least 90% of its "ICTI" and "net capital gains" (in excess of its "capital loss carryforward" balance; if applicable) in any given tax year in order to be eligible for the tax benefits allowed to an RIC (dividends paid deduction at the corporate level). When these two figures are combined, this comprises PSEC's net ICTI, also known as the company's annual distribution requirement ("ADR"). There is one specific "exclusion" to this rule (the "spillback provision"), which is mentioned later in the article. With that being said, readers can look back at my prior PSEC articles for a further discussion of this topic. Two Main Factors PSEC Considers Regarding the Company's Dividend: PSEC's management team has either stated or implied the company's dividend is mainly based on the following two factors: First Factor: Intend to cover the company's dividend payout level with NII (currently, the company's "minimum expected NII" over the foreseeable future). Second Factor: Intend to cover the company's annual dividend payout level with net ICTI. The first factor will focus on PSEC's NII and cumulative undistributed NII, and will be analyzed via TEST 1 and TEST 2. The second factor will focus on PSEC's net ICTI and cumulative undistributed taxable income ("UTI"), and will be analyzed via TEST 3 and TEST 4. Readers should understand this distinction as the four tests are presented and analyzed below. First Main Factor - Intend to Cover the Company's Dividend Payout Level with NII: To test management's first main factor, I believe it is necessary to analyze and discuss PSEC's past quarterly NII figures to see if the company's dividend distributions were covered. This will lead to a better understanding of the overall trends regarding this particular component and possible future pitfalls that may arise. This includes PSEC using the company's cumulative undistributed NII balance on any NII quarterly overpayments. Table 1 below shows PSEC's NII from the fiscal second quarter of 2015 going back to the company's fiscal fourth quarter in 2013. Table 1 then compares PSEC's quarterly NII figure to the company's dividend distributions figure showing the quarterly underpayment (overpayment). Table 1 below then shows PSEC's quarterly cumulative undistributed NII (deficit) balance for the same time frames. (Source: Table 1 created entirely by myself, partially using PSEC data obtained from the SEC's EDGAR Database ) Using Table 1 above as a reference, the quarterly figures in regards to the red references "A", "B", and "C" are derived from PSEC's quarterly SEC submissions. All remaining referenced figures are checked and tied back to various spreadsheets and data from PSEC's supported documentation, where applicable. Table 1 will be the main source of information as TEST 1 and TEST 2 are analyzed below. Now let us begin PSEC's current dividend sustainability analysis. TEST 1 - Quarterly NII Versus Quarterly Distributions Analysis: - See Red References "C, D, E, (D / C)" in Table 1 Above Next to the December 31, 2014 Column Using Table 1 above as a reference, I take PSEC's quarterly "NII" figure (see red reference "C") and subtract this amount by the quarterly "distributions from NII" figure (see red reference "D"). If PSEC's red reference "C" is greater than the company's red reference "D", then PSEC technically had enough quarterly NII to pay out the company's dividend distributions for a particular quarter. Any excess NII left over, after accounting for the dividend distributions, would be added to PSEC's cumulative undistributed NII (deficit) balance. This particular balance will be further discussed within TEST 2 later in the article. If PSEC's red reference "C" is less than the company's red reference "D", then the company technically did not have enough quarterly NII to pay out its dividend distributions for a particular quarter and must use a portion of the remaining cumulative undistributed NII (deficit) balance to help with the overpayment. Still using Table 1 above as a reference, PSEC had NII of $94.5 and $91.3 million for the fiscal first and second quarters of 2015, respectively. In comparison, PSEC had dividend distributions of ($114.3) and ($118.2) million for the fiscal first and second quarters of 2015, respectively. When calculated, PSEC had an overpayment of NII of ($19.8) and ($26.9) million for the fiscal first and second quarters of 2015, respectively (see red reference "(C - D) = E"). This calculates to a dividend distributions payout ratio of 121% and 129% for the fiscal first and second quarters of 2015, respectively (see red reference "(D / C)"). As such, I believe it can be determined that PSEC materially overpaid the company's NII during these two fiscal quarters. When looking at the dividend distributions payout ratio from the fiscal fourth quarter of 2013 to the fiscal second quarter of 2015, one can see this ratio has gradually increased. In my opinion, considering TEST 1 on a "standalone basis", this evidence helps support PSEC's recent monthly dividend per share rate reduction, which began in February 2015. Now let us take this analysis a step further and perform TEST 2. TEST 2 - Cumulative Undistributed NII Coverage of Quarterly Dividend Distributions Ratio Analysis: - See Red References "D, F, (F / D)" in Table 1 Above Next to the December 31, 2014 Column Once again using Table 1 above as a reference, I take PSEC's "cumulative undistributed NII (deficit)" figure (see red reference "F") and divide this amount by the quarterly "distributions from NII" figure (see red reference "D"). From this calculation, PSEC's "cumulative undistributed NII coverage of quarterly dividend distributions ratio" is obtained (see red reference "(F / D)"). The higher the ratio, the more positive the results are regarding PSEC's current dividend sustainability. Basically, this ratio shows the amount of cumulative undistributed NII covering the current quarter's dividend distributions (after taking the current month's dividend distributions accrual into account). Continuing to use Table 1 above as a reference, PSEC had a cumulative undistributed NII (deficit) balance of $18.0 and ($8.9) million at the end of the fiscal first and second quarters of 2015, respectively. This considers the fact that PSEC had disclosed prior-period adjustments to the company's cumulative undistributed NII of $11.0 and ($4.3) million during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2014 and fiscal first quarter of 2015, respectively. These prior-period adjustments generally occur when PSEC performs the company's annual tax return. These adjustments will be discussed in detail later in the article. Having an inverse correlation to the material quarterly overpayments of NII shown in TEST 1, PSEC had a cumulative undistributed NII coverage of quarterly dividend distributions ratio of 0.16 and (0.08) as of 9/30/2014 and 12/31/2014, respectively. As such, this ratio continued to decrease during the fiscal first and second quarters of 2015. When looking at the cumulative undistributed NII (deficit) balance from the fiscal fourth quarter of 2013 to the fiscal second quarter of 2015, one can see that this balance materially decreased. PSEC had a cumulative undistributed NII balance of $77.1 million at the end of the fiscal fourth quarter of 2013. As stated earlier, as of 12/31/2014, PSEC's cumulative undistributed NII (deficit) balance was ($8.9) million. When calculated, this balance decreased ($86.0) million over the past six fiscal quarters. When calculated, PSEC had a cumulative undistributed NII coverage of quarterly dividend distributions ratio of 0.95 as of 6/30/2013. As stated earlier, PSEC had a cumulative undistributed NII coverage of quarterly dividend distributions ratio of (0.08) as of 12/31/2014. When calculated, this ratio decreased (1.03) over the past six fiscal quarters. As of 12/31/2014, this was the lowest cumulative undistributed NII coverage of quarterly dividend distributions ratio I have calculated since I have covered PSEC. In my opinion, considering TEST 2 on a "standalone basis", this evidence helps support PSEC's recent monthly dividend per share rate reduction, which began in February 2015. Since PSEC's quarterly NII "breakeven" began to materially decrease beginning in February 2015 (due to the recent dividend cut), it is only prudent to now analyze if the company's past NII could have covered its newly reduced dividend distributions payout level. To perform this analysis, Table 2 is provided below. (Source: Table created entirely by myself, partially using PSEC data obtained from the SEC's EDGAR Database [link provided below Table 1]) Using Table 2 above as a reference, the number of outstanding shares of common stock as of 1/28/2015, 2/25/2015, and 3/27/2015 is projected to be 358.4, 358.6, and 358.7 million, respectively. The monthly common stock dividend for the months of January 2015, February 2015, and March 2015 was/will be $0.11055, $0.0833, and $0.0833 per share, respectively. When calculated, I am projecting PSEC will have dividend distributions of ($99.4) million for the fiscal third quarter of 2015. When compared to NII of $94.5 and $91.3 million for the fiscal first and second quarters of 2015, it would appear PSEC will have a slight-modest overpayment of NII for the fiscal third quarter of 2015. With that being said, assuming the new monthly dividend distributions rate of $0.0833 per share is maintained throughout 2015, quarterly dividend distributions will be approximately $90 million starting in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015 (quarter ending 6/30/2015). As such, it would appear PSEC's new monthly dividend distributions rate of $0.0833 per share has been supported by recent quarterly NII figures. When looking at the results from TEST 1 and TEST 2, I believe the probability of PSEC being able to maintain the company's past monthly dividend distributions rate slightly above $0.11 per share materially decreased due to the severity of the two most recent quarterly NII overpayments. However, when considering PSEC's new monthly dividend distributions rate of $0.0833 per share, the company's NII figures over the past two fiscal quarters appear to support the recently reduced payout level. With that being said, TEST 1 and TEST 2 do not specifically account for PSEC's net ICTI figures (which will be discussed in TEST 3 and TEST 4 below) or any future topics/trends to consider (which will be discussed in PART 2 of the article). TEST 3 and TEST 4 need to be performed to gain further clarity on the company's current dividend sustainability. Now, let us analyze and discuss the second main factor PSEC considers when choosing a proper dividend distributions per share rate. Second Main Factor - Intend to Cover the Company's Annual Dividend Payout Level with Net ICTI: To "fully" understand and accurately project a BDC's dividend sustainability, one must understand the subtle differences between a company's NII and net ICTI figures/cumulative balances. NII is a GAAP figure which is based on the accrual method of accounting. Net ICTI is an IRC figure which is generally based on the cash method of accounting (some exceptions, but I am keeping it simple for this discussion). I will briefly explain the differences between a company's NII and net ICTI figures. In order for PSEC to come up with a proper ICTI figure, there are specific GAAP to IRC adjustments (reversals) that need to be performed each quarter. Income and expense recognition of certain accounting transactions differ between GAAP and the IRC (book versus tax accounting treatments). A majority of PSEC's book-to-tax differences (either temporary or permanent in nature) consist of the following: 1) deferred financing fees on loans and deferred offering costs in relation to equity raises; 2) amortization (accretion) of loan/investment premiums (discounts); and 3) timing recognition of interest income on certain loans/investments. There are several additional book-to-tax adjustments that PSEC periodically recognizes. However, for purposes of this article, further discussion of these additional adjustments is unwarranted. Once PSEC's ICTI is known, one adds all net capital gains to this figure (if a capital loss carryforward does not exist). PSEC had a material capital loss carryforward balance as of 8/31/2014 to offset any net capital gains that might arise in the future. As such, this balance will continue to remain $0 for the foreseeable future, even if the company realizes a material amount of net capital gains on its debt/equity investments. After this calculation, PSEC's net ICTI figure is known. Let us now move on with PSEC's dividend sustainability analysis. To test management's second main factor, I believe it is necessary to analyze and discuss PSEC's past quarterly net ICTI figures to see if the company's quarterly dividend distributions were covered. This will lead to a better understanding of the overall trends regarding this particular component, and possible future pitfalls that may arise. This includes PSEC using the company's cumulative UTI balance on any net ICTI overpayments. Table 3 below shows PSEC's net ICTI from the fiscal second quarter of 2015 going back to the company's fiscal fourth quarter in 2013. The table then compares PSEC's quarterly net ICTI figure to the company's dividend distributions figure showing the quarterly underpayment (overpayment). It then shows PSEC's quarterly cumulative undistributed net ICTI (deficit) and cumulative UTI balances for the same time frames. Side Note: As stated earlier, PSEC's fiscal year-end, based on GAAP methodologies, is June 30th of a given year. However, PSEC's tax year-end, based on IRC methodologies, is August 31st of a given year. As such, there's a two-month gap between its fiscal and tax year-end. Table 3 is providing IRC information based on fiscal year-end time frames to better compare and contrast cumulative undistributed NII (discussed above) and cumulative UTI (discussed below). (Source: Table created entirely by myself, partially using PSEC data obtained from the SEC's EDGAR Database [link provided below Table 1]) Using Table 3 above as a reference, the quarterly figures in regards to the red reference "A" and "H" are derived from PSEC's quarterly SEC submissions. All remaining referenced figures are checked and tied back to various spreadsheets and data from PSEC's supported documentation, where applicable. Table 3 will be the main source of information as TEST 3 and TEST 4 are analyzed below. Now, let us begin the next phase of PSEC's current dividend sustainability analysis. TEST 3 - Quarterly Net ICTI Versus Quarterly Distributions Analysis: - See Red References "K, D, L, (D / K)" in Table 3 Above Next to the December 31, 2014 Column Using Table 3 above as a reference, I take PSEC's quarterly "net ICTI" figure (see red reference "K") and subtract this amount by the quarterly "distributions from net ICTI" figure (see red reference "D"). If PSEC's red reference "K" is greater than the company's red reference "D", then PSEC technically had enough quarterly net ICTI to pay out the company's dividend distributions for a particular quarter. Any excess net ICTI left over, after accounting for the dividend distributions, would be added to PSEC's cumulative UTI balance. This particular balance will be further discussed within TEST 4 later in the article. If PSEC's red reference "K" is less than the company's red reference "D", then the company technically did not have enough quarterly net ICTI to pay out its dividend distributions for a particular quarter, and must use a portion of the remaining cumulative UTI balance to help with the overpayment. Still using Table 3 above as a reference, PSEC had net ICTI of $151.3 and $107.8 million for the fiscal first and second quarters of 2015, respectively. In comparison, it had dividend distributions of ($114.3) and ($118.2) million for the fiscal first and second quarters of 2015, respectively. When calculated, PSEC had an underpayment (overpayment) of net ICTI of $37.0 and ($10.4) million for the fiscal first and second quarters of 2015, respectively (see red reference "(K - D) = L"). This calculates to a dividend distributions payout ratio of 76% and 110% for the fiscal first and second quarters of 2015, respectively (see red reference "(D / K)"). PSEC had a combined underpayment of net ICTI of $26.6 million for the fiscal first and second quarters of 2015. However, this material underpayment is a bit deceiving. As will be discussed later in the article, its original net ICTI figure in the fiscal first quarter of 2015 was amended by the company in the fiscal second quarter of 2015 via a prior-period adjustment. When looking at the dividend distributions payout ratio from the fiscal second quarter of 2014 to the fiscal second quarter of 2015, one can see PSEC materially overpaid the company's dividends during five out of the last six fiscal quarters. In my opinion, considering TEST 3 on a "standalone basis", this evidence helps support PSEC's recent monthly dividend per share rate reduction, which began in February 2015. Now, let us take this analysis a step further and perform TEST 4. TEST 4 - Cumulative UTI Coverage of Quarterly Dividend Distributions Ratio Analysis: - See Red References "D, N, (N / D)" in Table 3 Above Next to the December 31, 2014 Column Before we begin TEST 4, I would like to clarify the following two metrics shown within Table 3 above: 1) "cumulative net ICTI (deficit)" (see red reference "M"); and 2) "cumulative UTI" (see red reference "N"). PSEC's cumulative net ICTI (deficit) balance is a running balance that represents the company's quarterly net ICTI underpayments (overpayments) since its initial public offering ("IPO"). This balance shows BOTH positive and negative running balances to directly compare this balance to PSEC's cumulative undistributed NII (deficit) balance, which was discussed in TEST 2 earlier (direct IRC to GAAP comparison). PSEC's cumulative UTI balance is a running balance that also incorporates the company's quarterly net ICTI underpayments (overpayments). However, one material difference with this specific figure is that it will NEVER have a negative running balance. Technically, all negative balances are shown as $0. When PSEC's cumulative UTI balance is $0, the IRC classifies these dividend distributions as a "return of capital" ("ROC"). As such, this balance merely stays $0 until PSEC begins to record net ICTI in excess of dividend distributions once again. When analyzing a company's current dividend sustainability, I believe understanding both metrics (especially the cumulative UTI balance) is extremely important. Now, let us discuss the company's prior-period adjustments. As mentioned earlier, PSEC had prior-period adjustments to both GAAP and IRC figures. Within tables 1 and 3 above, I performed these "true-up/true-down" adjustments to properly update its cumulative undistributed NII (deficit), cumulative undistributed net ICTI (deficit), and cumulative UTI balances. The following quote from PSEC's 10-K for the fiscal year ended 6/30/2014 supports the notion of prior-period adjustments performed by the company: "... In general, we may make certain adjustments to the classification of net assets as a result of permanent book-to-tax differences, which may include merger-related items, differences in the book and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities, and nondeductible federal taxes, among other items. During the tax year ended August 31, 2013, we increased accumulated undistributed net investment income by $5,939, increased accumulated net realized loss on investments by $2,621 and decreased capital in excess of par value by $3,318. During the tax year ended August 31, 2012, we increased accumulated undistributed net investment income by $5,028, increased accumulated net realized loss on investments by $37,355 and increased capital in excess of par value by $32,327. Due to the difference between our fiscal and tax year end, the reclassifications for the taxable years ended August 31, 2013 and 2012 were recorded in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively..." The following quote from PSEC's 10-Q for the fiscal first quarter of 2015 (quarter ending 9/30/2014) supports additional prior-period adjustments performed by the company: "... During the tax year ended August 31, 2014, we decreased accumulated undistributed net investment income by $4,317, increased accumulated net realized loss on investments by $4,847, and increased capital in excess of par value by $9,164… Due to the difference between our fiscal and tax year ends, the reclassifications for the taxable year ended August 31, 2014 will be recorded in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2015..." In other words, PSEC had both GAAP and IRC adjustments to the past three GAAP fiscal and IRC tax year-end balances. As such, both my NII (Table 1) and net ICTI (Table 3) figures needed to be adjusted as well. Regarding the most recent prior-period adjustment (second quote above), my true-down adjustment of ($4.3) million was added to the company's cumulative undistributed NII (deficit), cumulative undistributed net ICTI (deficit), and cumulative UTI balances during the fiscal first quarter of 2015. Furthermore, to add an additional "layer" of complexity to these prior-period adjustments, PSEC recently recorded an additional material true-down adjustment regarding the company's cumulative undistributed net ICTI/UTI balances. To explain/support this adjustment, Table 4 is provided below. (Source: Data directly obtained from PSEC's quarterly earnings press release for the fiscal first and second quarters of 2015 ) Using Table 4 above as a reference, within PSEC's earnings press release for the fiscal first quarter of 2015 (first "sub-table" above), the company reported taxable income ("TI") of $151.3 million (TI is the equivalent to my reported net ICTI figures). One can see this figure is the same amount as my reported net ICTI figure in Table 3 above for the fiscal first quarter of 2015. Within PSEC's earnings press release for the fiscal second quarter of 2015 (second "sub-table" above), the company reported TI of $107.8 million for the fiscal second quarter of 2015. As such, if one were to add TI of $151.3 million from the fiscal first quarter of 2015 (shown in the first sub-table) and $107.8 million from the fiscal second quarter of 2015 (shown in the second sub-table), one would calculate TI of $259.0 million (rounded). However, when one looks at PSEC's "Six Months Ended December 31, 2014" column in the second sub-table, the company reported TI of only $248.8 million. As such, PSEC recorded a true-down adjustment of ($10.2) million in regards to its TI/net ICTI during the fiscal first quarter of 2015. In addition, PSEC materially changed the company's cumulative UTI balance as of 8/31/2014 during the fiscal second quarter of 2015. The following quote from its 10-Q for the fiscal first quarter of 2015 (quarter ending 9/30/2014; link provided above) discloses the company's cumulative UTI as of 8/31/2014: "... For the tax year ended August 31, 2014, we had distributions in excess of taxable income from the current tax year. After the excess distributions, we still had cumulative taxable income in excess of cumulative distributions, and therefore, we will elect to carry forward the excess for distribution to shareholders in the tax year ending August 31, 2015. The amount carried forward to 2015 will be approximately $71,797..." The following quote from PSEC's 10-Q for the fiscal second quarter of 2015 (quarter ending 12/31/2014; link provided above) discloses the company's amended cumulative UTI as of 8/31/2014: "... For the tax year ended August 31, 2014, we had distributions in excess of taxable income from the current tax year. After the excess distributions, we still had cumulative taxable income in excess of cumulative distributions, and therefore, we will elect to carry forward the excess for distribution to shareholders in the tax year ending August 31, 2015. The amount carried forward to 2015 will be approximately $50,073..." Using the two quotes above as direct evidence, PSEC performed a TI/net ICTI true-down adjustment of ($21.7) million during the fiscal second quarter of 2015 in regards to the 2014 tax year-end. To better explain/support this adjustment, Table 5 is provided below. (Source: Table created entirely by myself, partially using PSEC data obtained from the SEC's EDGAR Database [link provided below Table 1]) Using Table 5 above as a reference, in my opinion, the most important line item to discuss is PSEC's "cumulative UTI - per PSEC/my recalculation" figure (see red reference "H"). This figure is from the same account as was discussed within Table 3's red reference "N" earlier. The only difference is that Table 3 displays PSEC's cumulative UTI balance based on a GAAP fiscal year-end (June 30th of a given year), and Table 5 displays the company's cumulative UTI balance based on an IRC tax year-end (August 31st of a given year). The cumulative UTI balances for all columns represented in Table 5 above match to balances disclosed in PSEC's SEC-filed documents. These figures are then reconciled back to figures provided in Table 3 above. The second column from the left shows PSEC's cumulative UTI balance of $71.7 million as of 8/31/2014 (which matches the amount shown in the first quote above). Again, this was PSEC's cumulative UTI balance prior to the true-down adjustment of ($21.7) million that was performed during the fiscal second quarter of 2015. The first column from the left shows PSEC's cumulative UTI balance of $50.1 million as of 8/31/2014 (which matches the amount in the second quote above; off $1 due to rounding). Again, this was PSEC's cumulative UTI balance after the true-down adjustment of ($21.7) million was performed during the second fiscal quarter of 2015. Side Note: Yes, I know this level of "explanation" is really not necessary for most readers. However, I would rather show readers how all the figures (under each methodology) are reconciled, so a higher level of confidence can be derived from the factual data presented in this article. I agree, the constant prior-period adjustments make these calculations more difficult to understand/track. However, in my opinion, the reconciliations provided above should help readers understand the effects of the recently announced prior-period adjustments to both GAAP and IRC cumulative balances. The reconciliations also help understand the subtle differences between PSEC's fiscal year-end of June 30th of a given year and the company's tax year-end of August 31st of a given year. Now that I have discussed/reconciled all of PSEC's new prior-period adjustments (both GAAP and IRC methodologies), let us perform TEST 4 by using the information provided back in Table 3. Using Table 3 above as a reference, I take PSEC's "cumulative undistributed UTI" figure (see red reference "N") and divide this amount by the quarterly "distributions from net ICTI" figure (see red reference "D"). From this calculation, PSEC's "cumulative UTI coverage of quarterly dividend distributions ratio" is obtained (see red reference "(N / D)"). The higher the ratio, the more positive the results regarding PSEC's current dividend sustainability. Basically, this ratio shows the amount of cumulative UTI covering the current quarter's dividend distributions (after taking the current month's dividend distributions accrual into account). Continuing to use Table 3 above as a reference, PSEC had a cumulative UTI balance of $70.5 and $39.2 million at the end of the fiscal first and second quarters of 2015, respectively. Again, Table 3 is providing IRC information based on fiscal year-end time frames to better compare and contrast cumulative undistributed NII (discussed in TEST 2 above) and cumulative UTI. One should note, these cumulative UTI balances are materially higher (by approximately $45-55 million) when compared to PSEC's cumulative undistributed NII (deficit) balance for the same time frames. As such, this is why I believe net ICTI figures should also be analyzed in any BDC's current dividend sustainability analysis. Due to PSEC's recent material dividend reduction, these IRC metrics now provide direct evidence for any potential "special dividends" periodically being declared. The following quote per PSEC's earnings press release for the fiscal second quarter of 2015 (quarter ending 12/31/2014; link provided above) confirms that the company's cumulative UTI balance as of 12/31/2014 matches the cumulative UTI balance calculated in Table 3: "... We have generated cumulative taxable income in excess of cumulative dividends to shareholders since Prospect's initial public offering ("IPO") in 2004. From that IPO through December 2014, our taxable income is $39.2 million in excess of dividends to shareholders, an excess of $0.11 per share..." Having an inverse correlation to the quarterly underpayments (overpayments) of net ICTI shown in TEST 3, PSEC had a cumulative UTI coverage of quarterly dividend distributions ratio of 0.62 and 0.33 as of 9/30/2014 and 12/31/2014, respectively. Again, the 0.62 ratio as of 9/30/2014 is somewhat deceiving due to the prior-period adjustment that occurred during the fiscal second quarter of 2015. Regardless, this ratio modestly-materially decreased during the fiscal second quarter of 2015. TEST 4's results were fairly similar to TEST 2's results regarding overall trends (fairly sizable net decrease to both ratios) during the fiscal second quarter of 2015. When looking at the cumulative UTI balance from the fiscal fourth quarter of 2013 to the fiscal second quarter of 2015, one can see how this balance has materially decreased. PSEC had a cumulative UTI balance of $102.3 million at the end of the fiscal fourth quarter of 2013. As stated earlier, as of 12/31/2014, the company's cumulative UTI balance was only $39.2 million. When calculated, this balance decreased ($63.1) million over the past six fiscal quarters. When calculated, PSEC had a cumulative UTI coverage of quarterly dividend distributions ratio of 1.26 as of 6/30/2013. As stated earlier, PSEC had a cumulative UTI coverage of quarterly dividend distributions ratio of 0.33 as of 12/31/2014. When calculated, this ratio decreased (0.93) over the past six fiscal quarters. As of 12/31/2014, this was one of the lowest cumulative UTI coverage of quarterly dividend distributions ratios I have calculated since I've been covering PSEC. In my opinion, considering TEST 4 on a "standalone basis", this evidence helps support PSEC's recent monthly dividend per share rate reduction, which began in February 2015. Since PSEC's quarterly net ICTI "breakeven" began to materially decrease beginning in February 2015 (due to the recent dividend cut), it is only prudent to now analyze if the company's past net ICTI could have covered its newly reduced dividend distributions payout level. As stated within TEST 2 earlier, I am projecting PSEC will have dividend distributions of ($99.4) million for the fiscal third quarter of 2015. When compared to net ICTI of $151.3 and $107.8 million for the fiscal first and second quarters of 2015 (disregards any prior-period adjustments), it would appear PSEC will have a modest-material underpayment of net ICTI for the fiscal third quarter of 2015. Assuming the new monthly dividend distributions rate of $0.0833 per share is maintained throughout 2015, quarterly dividend distributions will be approximately $90 million starting in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015 (quarter ending 6/30/2015). As such, it would appear PSEC's new monthly dividend distributions rate of $0.0833 per share has been easily supported by recent quarterly net ICTI figures. When looking at the results from TEST 3 and TEST 4, I believe the probability of PSEC being able to maintain the company's past monthly dividend distributions rate slightly above $0.11 per share decreased due to the severity of the cumulative UTI balance reduction over the past few years. However, when considering PSEC's new monthly dividend distributions rate of $0.0833 per share, the company's net ICTI figures over the past few years appear to easily support the recently reduced payout level. Due to the recently reduced payout level, including the fact that PSEC had an additional "cushion" per se with the company's cumulative UTI balance of $39.2 million as of 12/31/2014, I believe the probability of the company declaring future periodic special dividends is a valid consideration. Of course, PSEC's cumulative UTI balance and cumulative UTI coverage of quarterly dividend distributions ratio should be monitored going forward. With that being said, PART 2 will discuss some recent topics/trends that may counter (or confirm) the evidence obtained within TEST 1, TEST 2, TEST 3, and TEST 4 above. To sum up the information in PART 1 of this article, four dividend sustainability tests were performed on PSEC. The first two tests were based on PSEC's NII figures, which are based on GAAP methodologies. Then next two tests were based on PSEC's net ICTI figures, which are based on IRC methodologies. TEST 1 provided the following information in regards to PSEC's NII for the fiscal first and second quarters of 2015, respectively: PSEC's NII Quarterly Payout Ratio: 121% and 129% TEST 2 provided the following information in regards to PSEC's cumulative undistributed NII (deficit) balance and cumulative undistributed NII coverage of quarterly dividend distributions ratio as of 9/30/2014 and 12/31/2014, respectively: PSEC's Cumulative Undistributed NII (Deficit) Balance: $18.0 and ($8.9) Million PSEC's Cumulative Undistributed NII Coverage of Quarterly Dividend Distributions Ratio: 0.16 and (0.08) When looking at the results from TEST 1 and TEST 2 (based on GAAP methodologies), PART 1 has concluded the probability of PSEC being able to maintain the company's past monthly dividend distributions rate slightly above $0.11 per share materially decreased due to the severity of the two most recent quarterly NII overpayments. However, when considering PSEC's new monthly dividend distributions rate of $0.0833 per share, the company's NII figures over the past two fiscal quarters appear to support the recently reduced payout level. Next, TEST 3 provided the following information in regards to PSEC's net ICTI for the fiscal first and second quarters of 2015, respectively: PSEC's Net ICTI Quarterly Payout Ratio: 76% and 110% However, as was discussed above, during the fiscal second quarter of 2015, PSEC disclosed a material prior-period adjustment, which lowered the company's net ICTI during the fiscal first quarter of 2015. This should be considered when looking at the analysis performed in TEST 3. Finally, TEST 4 provided the following information in regards to PSEC's cumulative UTI balance and cumulative UTI coverage of quarterly dividend distributions ratio as of 9/30/2014 and 12/31/2014, respectively: PSEC's Cumulative UTI Balance: $70.5 and $39.2 Million PSEC's Cumulative UTI Coverage of Quarterly Dividend Distributions Ratio: 0.62 and 0.33 When looking at the results from TEST 3 and TEST 4 (based on IRC methodologies), PART 1 has concluded the probability of PSEC being able to maintain the company's past monthly dividend distributions rate slightly above $0.11 per share decreased due to the severity of the cumulative UTI balance reduction over the past few years. However, when considering PSEC's new monthly dividend distributions rate of $0.0833 per share, the company's net ICTI figures over the past few years appear to easily support the recently reduced payout level. Due to the recently reduced payout level, including the fact that PSEC had an additional cushion per se with the company's cumulative UTI balance of $39.2 million as of 12/31/2014, I believe the probability of the company declaring future periodic special dividends is a valid consideration. Final Note: TEST 1, TEST 2, TEST 3, and TEST 4 do not "completely" consider certain future events that could occur over the next several years. Such events could have a direct impact on PSEC's future dividend sustainability. As such, I believe it is only prudent to include additional analysis regarding PSEC's future dividend sustainability. As such, PART 1 of this article is only a PARTIAL analysis. A "full" conclusion regarding PSEC's future dividend sustainability will not be provided yet. PART 2 of this article will just pick up where PART 1's analysis ends. Since PART 1 of this article mainly covered PSEC's past and current performance, PART 2 will transition to a more "forward-looking" dividend sustainability analysis, and will discuss some additional topics/trends to consider in a general net rising interest rate environment that may counter (or confirm) the evidence obtained within PART 1. PART 2 will also perform an analysis of PSEC's future NAV sustainability. At the end of PART 2 of this article, I will include the following PSEC projections: 1) next set of dividend declarations (dividend per share rate for May 2015 and June 2015); and 2) NAV per share ranges for the next several fiscal quarters. PART 2 will also include my current BUY, SELL, or HOLD recommendation regarding PSEC. PART 2 of this article will be available to readers in the near future.
