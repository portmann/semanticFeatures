Learn more about PRO » Brookfield Infrastructure is looking at a significant investment phase that could see the company invest billions in new cash flow-generating opportunities across the globe. Brookfield Infrastructure is positioned to take advantage of its low cost of capital and target motivated sellers that need to dispose of assets to improve their balance sheets. High mid-single digit cash flow can support a fair value in the low $50s, but it will take time for new investments to translate into higher dividends. Infrastructure specialist Brookfield Infrastructure (NYSE: BIP ) may not have the gaudiest recent track record - the shares are up almost 6% over the past year, and up about 8% since my last article - but the company has a good track record of efficiently generating cash flows from its investments and passing them along to investors as dividends. What's more, with many governments and emerging market corporations experiencing meaningful credit stress, Brookfield is looking to leverage its position as a high-quality buyer with a low cost of capital to add significant assets to the portfolio. Modeling Brookfield Infrastructure is always going to require some guesswork about the amount of capital the company will deploy into acquisitions and growth, as well as the cost and form of that capital (including equity raises). That said, I believe management will succeed in generating a long term per-share distributable cash flow growth rate in the mid-single digits to high single digits. Discounted back, that suggests a fair value in the high $40's to low $50's and argues for serious consideration of these shares. Is It Europe? Is It Brazil? Maybe Both? One of the aspects to following or owning Brookfield Infrastructure that readers will just have to accept is that analysts seem to be "prisoners of the moment" when it comes to reacting to what the company may do next with its investment spending. That's forgivable to a point - how/where the company directs its investment spending will shape future cash flows and in the absence of clear guidance from management (which is not in its own interests, as it could lead to higher asset prices) you end up paying more attention to rumors and information gleaned from news reports of potential or real moves. To wit, it wasn't so long ago (September of 2014) that there was a lot of buzz about the company's interest in Europe. The company not only opened an office in Madrid, it also laid out an overview of $50 billion in potential opportunities across toll roads, airports, utility networks, telecom infrastructure, and water, with a particular apparent focus on Southern Europe (Italy and Spain). Adding some fuel to that fire, the company did in fact participate in a deal that brought it a nearly one-quarter interest in TDF - the largest French tower operator. This was a pretty respectable investment for Brookfield at about $500 million and its first real foray into telecom, but the double-digit expected FFO yield (12% to 15%) was very much in tune with what long-time followers of this company have come to expect. And yet, Brazil may be just as much, if not more, of a near-term opportunity. Management commented after the last earnings report that it believed it could invest $2 billion in Brazil over the next six to 18 months. Some of that investment is likely to be in the form of investment spending to support the VLI rail assets, but the company also tendered for the remaining stake in toll road operator Arteris and is moving forward with a $263 million loan to OAS as debtor-in-position financing as part of an effort to acquire its stake in Invepar, an operator of toll roads and airports. But wait, there could be more. There are plenty of stressed Brazilian companies looking at unmanageable credit situations (like OAS) that may be looking to sell infrastructure assets that would suit Brookfield's needs. I'd also note that Brazil's development bank has talked about $200B in infrastructure investment in Brazil over the next four years, and the government has been talking about privatizing more roads, airports, and railroads. I don't expect Brookfield to be very active here (the company avoids auctions, as asset values tend to get higher than in negotiated transactions), but I do believe there is an opportunity for Brookfield to put its much lower cost of capital to work in picking up quality assets. Lackluster Near-Term Results, But A Long-Term Vision Brookfield Infrastructure isn't going to knock it out of the park every quarter, due in part to currency moves, but also portfolio restructurings and simple year-to-year variability. EBITDA was down 2% as reported in the first quarter and reported funds from operations were flat, but on a "same store" constant currency basis FFO was up 11%. Said differently, toll roads, coal terminals, ports, and electricity distribution networks are not a path to getting rich quick - instead, they offer good inflation-controlled long-term growth and attractive rates of return over that long term. Along those lines, I'd note that management is openly looking for add-ons and roll-ups in the district energy business that could double the size of the business relatively quickly. I'd also note, though, that management does not view its asset base as an oubliette - it is more than willing to put assets into the portfolio and then take them out again at a later time when there are better uses for the capital. To that end, management is selling out of Cross Sound Cable (a New England transmission business) and the NGPL pipeline business. I'm looking for Brookfield Infrastructure to generate long-term per-share distributable cash flow growth of around 6% to 7% over the long-term. I think actual cash flow growth at the firm level will grow faster than that, but management has shown that it is willing to issue equity to accumulate capital for acquisitions. This does not bother me - I believe the cost of Brookfield's equity is in the high single digits and so long as the cash return on new investments continues to meet management's hurdle rate, this is a winning proposition. Discounting the cash flows (after deducting maintenance capex) back, I come up with a fair value a little above $50. A 20% boost relative to my prior estimate is a large one in my opinion, and it is driven by what I believe is the probability that Brookfield adds meaningful assets to the portfolio in the coming 18 to 24 months - a position I believe is supported by the company's capital raises and stated acquisition goals. In addition to basic operating risk (how well the assets are managed), the ability of management to close deals and do so on terms that generate attractive cash-on-cash returns is the key risk I see to that valuation. I would also note that the company's new investments will eventually support higher dividends, but distribution growth could be less impressive in the near term as the company redeploys cash towards asset accumulation. Brookfield Infrastructure has established a pretty good history of acquiring strong assets whose revenues and cash flows are largely protected by inflation-indexed contracts and natural or regulatory monopolies. Management has also established a good history of turning over the portfolio in pursuit of higher returns. This isn't a risk-free situation, particularly given the company's willingness to invest in markets like Brazil and Southern Europe, but I believe the long-term potential of these infrastructure asset investments is such that Brookfield Infrastructure is worth a closer look today.
