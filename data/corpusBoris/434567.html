null LUXEMBOURG, June 16 Euro zone finance ministers see no reason to change fiscal or financial stability policies in the single currency bloc before a British referendum on whether to leave the European Union, the chairman of euro zone finance ministers said. The June 23rd vote is seen a one of the main risks this year to global economic growth. Polls in Britain show a slight lead of the "leave" campaign, but Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the chairman of euro zone finance ministers meeting for regular monthly talks in Luxembourg, said ministers were watching the possibility of a Brexit but it was not on the agenda. "Of course we are concerned, we are following it closely and considering possible scenarios," he told a news conference. "Do we need to change our polices in the fields of financial stability or fiscal policy, etc -- no. I think that we have a strong set up and we are in a much, much stronger situation than we were some years ago, also in terms of shock absorption capacity to deal with any shocks that might occur," he said. "So I don't think there is any reason now to change policies, not in the fiscal field, not in the financial stability field," he said.
