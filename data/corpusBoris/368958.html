Now, I’d like to turn the call over to Alex Smith, Pier 1 Imports’ President and Chief Executive Officer. Alex? Thanks, Bryan, and good afternoon, everyone. Also joining me on the call is Jeff Boyer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and other members of our senior leadership team are in the room with us today as well. 2016 marked our first year as a fully capable omni-channel retailer. Without doubt, it was a tough year, ending a tough transformation process, but we have emerged stronger with a clear view of the future. We have a new dynamic omni-channel business model that we can now exploit. Indeed, we have full scale omni-channel capabilities, some of which are well ahead of our home furnishing peers. We have so many opportunities to make our well-loved company not only loved by more customers, but also more profitable. Our brand health, which we measure through research multiple times a year, is extremely strong, at or near all-time highs for most of the metrics which we measure. The Pier 1 Imports name carries 99% brand awareness. The consistency of our brand positioning resonates as always. Our customers love Pier 1 Imports, our stores and our site. She loves our broad unique assortments that cover multiple aesthetics, good quality products that are priced to be affordable, merchandise that allows her to create her personal style and products that reflects the artisans who made them, products with a soul. Baby boomers, Generation X, and millennials can all showcase their creativity. We don’t need multiple brands. Pier 1 Imports appeals to all. Increased competitive activity, especially from on and offline deep discounters has altered the home furnishings playing field considerably. That said, specialty home furnishing is still a higher margin business, part of a large and fragmented industry, and there is ample room for many of us to succeed. There is certainly room for vibrant and successful Pier 1 Imports. It’s clear to us that the high level of promotional activity we’ve been witnessing across the retail spectrum for some time now is here to stay. It’s regrettable that the industry has done it to itself. We will continue to engage and remain competitive. Fortunately, recent history has taught us how to be smarter and more sophisticated about the way we spend our promotional dollars in this new area of retailing. And as we continue to develop our advanced analytical skills, we’ll continue to finesse our activities. We’re also developing ways to offset necessary discounts by concentrating on reducing other sources of merchandise margin degradation. We also believe we can grow initial mark up without raising selling prices. I’m glad to tell you that we’ve completed the heavy-lifting related to our inventory problems. And in the process, we laid the groundwork to build a more efficient distribution network, helped by our ongoing commitment to inventory turn improvements and our single inventory for both stores and e-Commerce. I’m very excited to see how our use of data and advanced analytics are changing the company for the better on many fronts. They will help to find cost efficiencies across the organization and help make us better decisions around promotional activity, media spend and real estate. Our use of data is expanding our understanding of how customers behave in the omni-channel world, so we can talk to her the right way and drive our attention and frequency rates even higher beyond the all-time highs we achieved in fiscal 2016. Our total sales and company comp sales in fiscal 2016 registered low single digit increases on a constant currency basis. Both sales and earnings were pressured by internal and external factors, namely our inventory issues and the intensity, promotional competitive environment, which we’ve discussed on previous calls. Nevertheless, there are a number of positive financial highlights from the year. We achieved strong double digit growth in e-Commerce sales, which reached 18% of total revenue. The business generated strong cash flow from operations of $164 million. We returned nearly $100 million of cash to shareholders by way of repurchases and cash dividends. We brought down our inventories by 15% from a year ago and we took significant costs out of the business. We’re planning fiscal 2017 to be a year of modest growth as we start to leverage our new omni-channel business model to drive sales, improve our operating efficiency and rebuild profitability. Let me talk about some of the things that are top of mind for us. The first is merchandising. Product is always front and center at Pier 1 Imports. The creativity of our merchant team and their ability to develop and orchestrate our unique assortments is, as we know, one of our not-so-secret secret weapons. We’re not a furniture store or a tabletop store or anything else with a narrow focused store. Our broad spectrum of merchandise categories is a strong competitive advantage which our customers love. We have considered purchases; we have [impulse] items. This year, we are evolving our go-to-market strategies to emphasize newness more strongly and are increasing our focus on our strongest categories. For example, season and holiday, fragrance and textiles which includes the expansion of bed and the introduction of bath this spring. We continue to have a robust furniture business and this year we will bring some of our best selling online-only SKUs to the stores. My second topic is marketing. We are significantly increasing our spend in fiscal 2017. This will allow us to reincorporate television into our media plan, without going backwards on our successful digital and print activity. So we’ll continue to utilize the digital e-mail and social media strategies that resulted in more frequent purchasing amongst not just our best customers, but among all known customers. In fiscal 2016, as you know, we rebuilt our legacy customer database and added new CRM functionality so that our marketing, customer relations and store teams have access to details and accurate information about how and when our customers spend. The database and CRM project is the most ambitious and complex IT work that we’ve undertaken and its impact will be felt enterprise wide. Equally exciting, the new database provides us with a platform to develop an extension to our successful Pier 1 rewards credit card loyalty program. This new entry level non-tender loyalty program is currently being piloted in three states. We will roll out nationwide later this year. The combination of the new database and expanded loyalty program and our new customer relations functionality should translate to higher spend from known customers and increase the number of new customers coming into the Pier 1 family. Additionally, we will increase the attractiveness of the Pier 1 rewards card by offering a zero interest option on larger purchases. Our ability to talk to known customers directly will also be helped by entry into the gift registry business this year. This will initially be rolled out online only with functionality coming to the stores at a later date. In fiscal 2016, known customers accounted for greater than 70% of sales, while repeat customers accounted for approximately 60% of sales. We anticipate being able to push these rates higher in fiscal 2017 as more customers enter our database. Now let’s talk about supply chain. We’re starting the new fiscal year on the right foot, with leaner inventory levels, increased capacity within our DC network and getting back on track with improved execution against our existing KPIs. There is more work to be done and opportunity to drive greater efficiency in the years ahead, more from Jeff on this a little later in the call. If merchandise is our first not-so-secret secret weapon, stores are our second. We began the multi-year process to close our lower volume low profitability stores. What remains is a large and highly productive portfolio, a nationwide network that is essential to our dynamic omni-channel model. Well over 90% of our revenues touch a store in one way or another. Our stores are important because they drive revenue, they serve as perhaps our best marketing vehicle and our store associates are outstanding brand ambassadors. As part of our store optimization program, we’re looking closely at the percentage of sales that transfer when we close a store, all sales including e-Comm. We’re also studying the long-term impact of our store relocation and refurbishment program that we’ve been implementing for over the last five years and we’re also starting to re-imagine our stores and are embarking on the store of the future project which we expect to begin testing late in summer. Costs, of course, are always a focus. As I mentioned earlier, we made excellent progress towards bringing down costs in fiscal 2016. As you’ll hear from Jeff, we are working to uncover additional opportunities across the company from the field organization to corporate headquarters. When we look at the year ahead, we see a tale of two halves. In the first half of fiscal 2017, our top line assumptions reflect a few key factors, including a cautious overall outlook, the closure of 23 Pier 1 Imports stores in February and the shift of Memorial Day from the first quarter into the second. From an earnings perspective, the first half will be impacted by investments in marketing and the final portion of costs from our recent supply chain issues, which are at last starting to disappear into the rearview mirror. Looking forward towards the second half of fiscal 2017, we expect to generate improved results across all of our key financial metrics: sales, merchandise margin, contribution from operations and earnings per share, as our initiatives around merchandising and product newness, margin structure and customer acquisition and retention begin to manifest. There has been much discussion in the investor community about how retail profitability is being pressured by the costs of running omni-channel businesses and the intense pressure on pricing. Whilst in the short-term there is obviously [truth to these twin thoughts], there has not been as much discussion about how retail companies are responding. At Pier 1 Imports, we believe that we have the inventiveness, adaptability and the desire to transcend these pressures over time. We have opportunities to improve our cost efficiency across the organization, in stores, in supply chain, in marketing and in corporate offices. As high margin specialty retailers, we can learn from lower margin retail formats that have been forced for decades to concentrate on cost efficiency. We have embarked on a multi-year project to help us do just this. We are 60 days into this work and have already identified many opportunities to streamline work and drive cost out of the business. Some of our ideas are achievable nearer-term, some longer-term, some require capital investments, but everything we see at this stage looks highly achievable. We also have promising ideas for revenue generation through product and brand extensions, which we had to put on pause as we worked our way through the operating issues resulting from our excess inventory position. Our entire organization worked extremely hard to make our omni-channel transformation a success. And having done it, we’re all energized by the long-term opportunity it affords us. We’re not planning for fiscal 2017 to be a banner year, but we believe the improvements we’re expecting will serve as a foundation for a more robust performance in future years. Fiscal 2017 will be about exploiting all aspects of our new omni-channel business model and positioning Pier 1 Imports return to a stable trajectory of profitable growth. At the same time, we remain committed to delivering shareholder value and plan to continue to utilize our strong cash flow to share repurchases and cash dividends. I’m extremely grateful to all our associates for all they do for our well loved company. They are committed to a culture of excellence, have the desire to delight our customers every time and continue to be inspired by the Pier 1 Imports brand. Thanks, Alex, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I get further into my prepared remarks, I want to point out that beginning with fiscal 2016’s earnings, we’ve changed our presentation of credit and debit card fees. What has changed is that we’re no longer reporting these fees as a reduction to net sales. They are now being reported as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. The result of the change in presentation is that both net sales and SG&A increase in equal and offsetting amount. There is no net impact to operating income, net income, the balance sheet or statement of cash flows. To help everyone reconcile their Pier 1 Imports financial models, in addition to the reconciliations in our press release today, we posted a supplemental historical data on the Investor Relations page of our website. While fiscal 2016 proved to have its operational and financial challenges, we did start to see signs of stabilization in store traffic trends in the fourth quarter. We don’t believe store traffic trends have fully turned the corner, but as Alex noted, our marketing plans for this year is designed specifically to drive new customer acquisition and increase store traffic. The biggest pressure point in fiscal 2016 was at the merchandise margin level. As we talked about on prior calls, promotional clearance pressures necessary in order to clear inventory and remain competitive and distribution inefficiencies contributed to the decline in merchandise margin. We’re pleased with the inventory reduction we were able to achieve which were ahead of our targets, but these reductions did come at some cost. Looking at our business model from a high level perspective, in fiscal 2016, we began to focus on reducing store cost to offset delivery and fulfillment deleveraging. These costs include occupancy, store payroll and store operational expenses. So from the standpoint of managing the core operational cost structure underlying our omni-channel model, we made good progress thus far in balancing our store operations cost against our delivery and fulfillment expenses. Turning now to our financial results, total sales in the fourth quarter decreased 1.4% to $542 million, while company comps decreased 0.6%. On a constant currency basis, total sales were down 50 basis points and company comps were up 30 basis points. This was ahead of what we projected, which reflects positive customer response to our holiday and seasonal goods as well as the heightened promotional activity during the period. E-Commerce sales remained strong with sales penetration of approximately 15% in the fourth quarter. That’s up from 12.6% in the fourth quarter of last year and represents e-Comm growth of about 16% year-over-year. On a full year basis, e-Commerce accounted for 16% of total sales, up from 11% in fiscal 2015. Fourth quarter merchandise margin dollars declined to $285 million from $309 million a year ago, while the merchandise margin rate came in at 52.5% compared to 56.1% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. The year over year decline of 360 basis points can be traced to two factors. First, approximately 300 basis points is due to higher promotional activity in the quarter. As we expected, we saw strong response from our markdown and clearance events post-holiday, which helped us achieve the greater than planned inventory reductions. At the same time, the competitive environment was intense, which factored to a merchandise margin rate below where we guided. Net-net, we are comfortable with the margin impact we absorbed relative to the headway made in bringing down inventories. The majority of the balance of the merchandise margin rate contraction in the quarter was tied to the recognition of incremental distribution center cost as the affected inventory was sold. For the full fiscal year 2016, merchandise margin was 55.3% of sales, a decline of 310 basis points compared to 58.4% last year. Almost two thirds of the decline is attributable to promotional and/or clearance markdown pricing, with the majority of the balance due to cost associated with inefficiencies in our distribution centers. We’re very pleased with the improvements we’ve made within our distribution centers and anticipate the inventory cost and recognition effects our fiscal 2016 operational issues will abate beginning with the second quarter of fiscal 2017. As Alex mentioned, the first quarter of fiscal 2017 was impacted by the fiscal 2016 supply chain expenses and an increase in our clearance cadence relative to Q1 last year. With respect to the supply chain, we see a number of areas for opportunity of improvement. These improvements should benefit merchandise margins over time. First, in the near term, we’ll see reduced costs including lower detention of the merch expenses, now that we have significantly reduced our inventories. Secondly, we’re relaying the DCs based on SKU profiles and velocity of turns which is expected to generate further efficiency in our DCs. Looking farther out, there will be ongoing supply chain productivity initiatives which could include network optimization and e-Commerce fulfillment from all DCs. Turning back to our financial results, delivery and fulfillment net cost increased both in dollars and as a percent of sales. We are, however, continuing to leverage these costs as a percentage of fulfilled sales. In the fourth quarter, we saw approximately two thirds of our e-Commerce sales fulfilled to the customer to ease their parcel or in-home delivery which is consistent with what we saw all year. Moving now to occupancy, in the fourth quarter, store occupancy cost declined to $74.1 million, down from $75.4 million last year. As a percent of total sales, they were flat year over year. For the full year, store occupancy costs were relatively flat on a dollar basis coming in at $298.6 million. As a percentage of sales, store occupancy cost leveraged 10 basis points to 15.7%. Fourth quarter profit was $196.9 million or 36.3% of total sales compared to $220.8 million or 40.2% of total sales a year ago. For the full year, gross profit was $705 million compared to $768 million last year. Gross profit as a percent of sales was 37.3% versus 40.8% in fiscal 2015. We maintained strict expense control in the fourth quarter with total SG&A down both in dollars and as a percent of sales. For the quarter, SG&A came in at $150 million, reflecting 60 basis points of leverage compared to the prior year. For the full year, SG&A expenses totaled $579 million or 30.6% of sales. This represents an improvement of 100 basis points versus fiscal 2015. 60 basis points of the improvement was attributable to savings within compensation for operations, with the balance primarily attributable to marketing. We made good progress reducing costs and we’ll continue to look at all areas of the business for additional opportunities. In fiscal 2017, we have planned increases in our marketing spend and bonus program [indiscernible] with the expectation of nearly $20 million of expense savings primarily coming from corporate headquarters and store operations. As Alex mentioned, we have a significant project underway to identify incremental FY17 efficiencies and cost reductions and to generate additional savings in future years. Q4 operating income totaled $34 million and net income was $19 million or $0.23 per share. For the full year, operating income totaled $75 million and net income was $40 million or $0.46 per share. Fourth quarter EBITDA totaled $46 million, which compares to $68 million a year ago. On a full year basis, EBITDA totaled $125 million, down from $176 million in fiscal 2015. Moving to the balance sheet, at the close of the year, we had $115 million in cash and cash equivalents and no cash borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Inventory at quarter end totaled $406 million, representing a decline of approximately 15% versus a year ago. We are targeting for inventories to be down modestly year over year by the end of fiscal 2017. Capital expenditures totaled $12 million in the fourth quarter and $52 million for the full year. For the full year, just under half of our capital investment was in support of information technology, which included sizable investments in support of our customer data excellence initiative. The remainder was split between investment in stores and supply chain. In fiscal 2017, we’re planning for capital spend of approximately $55 million, which will be directed towards the same three key targets as fiscal 2016, IT, including upgrades to pier1.com, investments in stores and also investments in the supply chain. Looking forward to fiscal 2017, we have a number of initiatives to drive top line, but we’re balancing that optimism with the recent trends in the business, especially store traffic and a decline in store base. We will continue to push on operational cost levers to offset delivery and fulfillment cost, which we expect in conjunction with improvements in merchandise margin will help drive higher year over year gross profit and contribution from operations. But there are headwinds to EPS growth, including a significant increase in marketing spend, an increased expense for potential bonus and equity awards, and a step up in depreciation. The biggest impact of these items will be felt in the first half, with the majority of our expected full year growth being driven by stronger performance in the third and fourth quarters. Turning to guidance, please keep in mind that all the metrics we’re providing are inclusive of our multi-year store optimization program currently underway. Note that the 33 net store closures in fiscal 2016 will result in a slightly wider disparity between our total sales growth and company comp sales growth figures in fiscal 2017 on the order of around 150 basis points for the full year. Let’s start with the full year guidance for fiscal 2017. We expect to drive company comparable sales growth between 1% and 3%. This implies net sales will be approximately flat due to store closures I just mentioned. Merchandise margins in fiscal 2017 are expected to be in the range of 56% to 57%, with additional improvements expected in following years. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales are expected to deleverage by about 50 basis points. Depreciation will be higher versus fiscal 2016 at approximately $56 million and we’re guiding EPS in the range of $0.42 to $0.50 on diluted shares of 80 million. For modeling purposes, it’s important to point out that our net interest expense will be up modestly year over year in fiscal 2017 in the range of $12 million. In addition, we’re forecasting our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 39.5%. For the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we expect company comparable sales to contract approximately 1% to 3%; merchandise margins to be in the range of 56% to 57%; and a loss per share in the range of $0.04 to $0.08. For the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we expect company comparable sales growth to be flat to up 2%; merchandise margins to be approximately 55% to 56%; and EPS in the range of a loss of $0.02 to a profit of $0.02. For the second half of fiscal 2017, we’re anticipating continued year over year improvement in the top line at the merchandise margin level and also at the bottom line. As we look at the longer term picture, we believe we have opportunity to rebuild operating margin and drive more consistent earnings growth even on low single digit top line increases. We believe this can be accomplished based on the following. First, there’s an opportunity to recapture merchandise margin dollars by freshening our assortments, rationalizing our SKUs, optimizing our supply chain, improving input costs and increasing our promotional effectiveness. Second, the rationalization of store base will continue to benefit occupancy cost as well as store payroll. Third, delivery and fulfillment costs will continue to deleverage on a total basis, but will begin to leverage as a percentage of e-Commerce sales. Fourth, we’ll continue to look at all aspects of the business to drive cost efficiencies. And lastly, we expect to see depreciation level-off the next few years. So I guess my question, it’s probably more for Jeff. As we think about – I know this is a topic we’ve discussed before, but as we look at Pier 1 work down inventories more than you initially expected, 15% last year. So as we think about here in the current year, where should we on the P&L, where will be the biggest benefits and how should we think about the benefits of operating with less inventory? Obviously, one, you’ll have less clearance activity [indiscernible] but are there other buckets on the P&L that we should benefit or receive benefits with lower inventories? Most of those benefits will show up in the merchandise margin line. And Brian as you mentioned, they will show up in two places really that drive that, some of the issues we had in 2016 that we will be lapping around. One, we’ll have less clearance. And that will particularly happen in the second half of the year as we cycle through that and have less clearance. And secondly, we will have more efficiencies in our DCs versus last year’s inefficiencies and that will also show up through the merchandise margin line. As we think about how we should end inventories then this year, I think you made the comment in your prepared comments down slightly. So does that suggest now that inventory levels are kind of getting to where they should be for the business? Brian, if you look at our track record on inventory, we did a really good job for a lot of years at keeping inventory growth in line with sales growth. And our plan is by the end of this current fiscal year to get back to the position that we should always have been in if those two had moved in sync. So once we get back to where we should be, which will be the end of this year, as far as the Pier 1 brand is concerned, we’ll try and make sure that sales and inventory are pretty much in lockstep. I have a couple questions about sales. First, I was just wondering if you could help us understand the guidance for the first quarter which implies comps weaker than what you just reported. Is that based on what you’re seeing right now and are you embedding – like what are you embedding for that Memorial Day shift that you alluded to? On the Memorial Day shift, that’s worth about 100 basis points or so between the quarters, with the shift that’s going on. And I would say actually the current trends in the business are basically on track for the guidance that we provided at this point. But still if you adjust for that, it still points to a slight deceleration. Any idea what may be causing that in the first quarter and how you’re planning for that? Well, I think as we said in all our prepared remarks, I think we’ve got a number of things on our mind, one of which is just the general environment and two is we’re being very cautious given our recent history and I think those are the two main factors that we baked into those Q1 numbers. And then just one follow-up. Alex, you talked a lot about some of the focused categories. You named a few. Where do you see the biggest opportunities? And do you feel like there are specific areas where it’s kind of core to your offering but maybe you’ve been under-punching your potential, maybe underperforming, but you see opportunities for improvement here in 2016? I would say that generally speaking, I’m more pleased with our new product introductions this spring, starting in January, than I have been for a while. So I think that’s good news as far as I’m concerned. In terms of categories that we sort of under-punched or over-punched, I don’t want to be too specific for obvious reasons, but I think the most important thing is what we said in the prepared remarks is about focusing on newness because what we’re seeing is our customer is responding extremely well to newness, not to say that our revised SKUs are not important, they are. They’re a huge percentage of our business. But she is liking newness and we have a number of categories where I think our market share is significantly above our overall market share and we’re going to make sure that we exploit those to their fullest. So we’re feeling very good about all of that. My first question is on retention from closed stores. What has been the experience thus far, whether it’s at existing stores or online and then what’s the expectation that’s captured for this coming next fiscal year? The sales transfer has been consistent with our modeling which has been about a 20% transfer to physical stores. We’re actually finding that the online transfer has actually been equal to what we’ve been showing for those individual stores, actually picks up a little bit by about 10% or so. And likely what that is is some of our customers rather than physically going to the other store they’ve now shifted to online, they’re comfortable doing that. So we’ve been pretty consistent with about a 20% transfer of the sales from physical stores and the full online transfer seen in the business transferring actually picking up by 10% or so. So that’s what our models have said and we’ve been pretty consistent and performing against that. My second question is a little bit higher level, thinking about the financial model of the business. So this year comps for the full year guided, I guess, low positives, I guess single digit. And my question is if you look out another year, I don’t know if the competitive landscape changes much. You’re trying to grow past it and gain market share, but the numbers imply you’re losing some market share in totality and clearly you want to accelerate the sales growth. But let’s say you’re in this low single digit sort of comp environment going forward, is the model built to leverage let’s say more, let’s say in the out year than it is this year? Are there certain spending drivers in this fiscal year that abate meaning some of the inventory issues subside further, some of marketing cycle such that when you’re in this low single digit environment, you’ll see some stronger growth in the out year? There’s a number of things in that. First, you’re absolutely correct. We’ve given back a bit of share in the last fiscal year after six or seven years of taking share. So we’re clearly not happy with that situation. The good news is that as far as we can tell the category is still growing. So there is room for us to get some of that share back. So I think that’s the first piece. In terms of how we generate the sales and the promotional activity, we are assuming that things continue the way they are and that the amount of discounted selling continues and we’re building our business based on that. But as we said in our prepared remarks, our job is to say okay, well, if this is the promotional cost that we have to deal with, let’s see how much of that we can offset by looking at all the other places where you get margin leakage. Some of that is the markdown, a big piece of it is the supply chain in general and the DC specifically, efficiency. Another part is to see what we can do in terms of our initial rise mark on versus the first costs. So I think there is many, many opportunities and our job now is it’s a new world we’re in, we have to think on a far, far more granular nature about all these parts of our business than perhaps we have had to in the past. Would you add to that, Jeff? I would add to that. And I would say everything correct, Alex, on that. I’d just add to that that cost leverage across the rest of the enterprise that we’re going to be very, very cost conscious. So Alex’s description was largely driving that merchandise margin level, but below that we’re really focused on how can we be more efficient store operating, on corporate expenses and everything else we do. So trying to leverage the expense structure on a low single digit model, that’s what our plans are going forward. I have a follow-up question on sales. I think you said that your guidance assumes that the current environment remains the same. So I was wondering if you could talk about a few of the things that give you confidence in that acceleration in the back half that are under your control. Well, I think there’s a laundry list of those things, Jessica. First of it is just how we did in Q1 and Q2 in fiscal 2016 versus Qs 3 and 4 in 2016. So we look at that. We’re very cognizant of what’s going to happen to the merchandise margin as we get through the back of the year and all those DC costs go behind us. In terms of the sales specifically, don’t forget we’ve talked about a significant ramp-up in our marketing plan. And a lot of that is about television and we expect the television to sort of – as we go through the year and we’re on air many, many weeks, we expect that to be a cumulative impact as we go into the year, as we go into the second half. I think those are the main ones. What have I missed, Jeff? Expanded loyalty program, it’d be very helpful to reach out to our customers as well as the gift registry that we have coming and the deferred payment program, all those things are going to be nice additives. And then on that marketing strategy, you’ve laid out in the first half the marketing spend looks like it will drive some deleverage which is implied to reverse in the second half. Will marketing levels remain elevated with some offsetting factors or how should we think about how that trends throughout the rest of the year? Jessica, the marketing spend is a little bit front end loaded just from a dollar standpoint. You also have to appreciate that’s also where we have less sales volume, so the deleverage there is greater in Q1 and Q2. Every quarter we will spend a bit more, spend more again in Q1 and Q2, a little bit lesser rate of increase in Q3 and Q4, we have higher sales. So there will be a deleverage across all the quarters, but it’s most pronounced in Q1 and Q2 for the spending levels and the dollar side that I’m talking about from a sales standpoint. Maybe just to expand on sales again, I know we touched on this a lot already. But just looking at the progression throughout the year and really breaking it down, right, into the two channels, direct and retail, our math assuming that you can maintain a 20% growth in the e-Commerce channel, the math would imply upwards of a 600 basis point improvement between the first quarter and the fourth quarter at the retail store level. I know you laid out a lot of reasons behind that, but is that right? And I guess going forward, where do you think e-Commerce can CAGR longer term, can you maintain that 20% growth rate for a longer period of time here? Steven, as far as what’s going to happen in e-Comm, I think we’re really very focused on the omni-channel model now and we are seeing our customers are choosing where they want to shop. We’ve told you that 90% of our sales touch a store in one way or other. So that mix between what goes through our POS and what goes direct to customer is just going to sort itself out depending on what the customer wants. So the way we’re approaching it is we have sales and we have costs. We have the costs of running the stores and we have costs of delivering to customers. And our job is to manage both those buckets of costs so that we optimize that important line that we talked to you about, the contribution from operations. So we are really not focused on the balance between the e-Comm and non-e-Comm. We’re focused on growing the total top line. And then just a follow-up on real estate [indiscernible] stores for the past three months here and there really is a big difference right in the store experience when you see a – do a relocation that has the lighting fixtures and the new flooring and so forth, do you guys have a plan for relocation this year? And I guess, where do you stand as far as progress on getting some relief as it relates to rent on the existing store base? On the relocation side of it, we have a modest relocation program for fiscal 2017 overall, but it’s under 10 as against high single digit overall relocation. We like you really are pleased with how our newer format stores perform and we think there’s a big opportunity. So we’re doing a lot of analysis right now to understand what that opportunity is. So more to come on the relocation front. It won’t be a big uptick in fiscal 2017 for that program, but looking at it for future years. On the rent side, on the rent negotiation discussions, they’re going along very well. I would tell you our landlords understand that we are all in this together as omni-channel evolves and brick and mortar retail evolves on it. So in our conversations with them as we get to option renewal time period or extension periods, they’ve been very willing to work with us on giving those lower rent levels or holding to where there are right now. So we’re pretty pleased with how those discussions continue to go. Alex, I know you don’t want to give too much way about how you are going to change your promotional strategy going forward, but if you can give us a couple of insights on how you’re thinking about evolving it in 2016 that would be really helpful. Evolving our strategy, well, what can I say about that? I mean, I think in some respects it’s going to be following the pattern that we established in calendar 2015 with a number of exceptions. Last year, you may remember we talked a lot about how we’ve been wrong-footed on the outdoor business because we traditionally used to hold our price all the way through to Memorial Day and the rest of the industry didn’t. So this year, we have gone out at the beginning of the outdoor season with selective promotional offers and you can see some of those running now if you go on to our website. So our outdoor cadence is significant. I think you’ll be seeing us hit the major public holidays a little harder than we did last year. So I think that will be different. I think in the way we project our brand in the print and through our online imagery, you’ll see us continue to upgrade the quality of our creative and I think you’ll appreciate that and see it to be different. Other than that, we’re going to continue to have a balance between category discounts and SKU based discounts, which we’ve always had. I think that’s pretty much it. I think earlier you referenced some changes to initial markup without raising selling prices, do I interpret that to mean that you’re going to be taking markups higher and having bigger discounts off of those going forward? I mean that is the implication from that, yes. But the important part of it, I want to make sure I’m really clear about is we’re not talking about raising selling prices. Don’t forget a lot – all those supply chain costs go into our initial mark on. And as we can get improvements through both the front end of our supply chain from vendor to DCs and the back end of our supply chain from DCs to stores and customers, the more we can pull those down, the more that can feed into our merchandise margin. And then we have some tangible benefits from currency exchange rates as well. And then lastly a follow-up, I understand that your focus on growing sales no matter what the channel, but have you changed or modified your approach driving online sales? It seems like the growth rate in e-Commerce sales has decelerated pretty markedly through fiscal 2016. How you think about that in 2017? I mean the deceleration was really mostly a question of cycling the huge growth that we had the year before which we’ve had in Q3 and Q4 of FY15. So I mean that was a big piece of it. When you look at the sales trends and the sales curve month on month in e-Commerce, it’s still doing astonishingly well. So we’re super pleased with all of that. It folds as a percentage of total revenue in the fourth quarter anyway just because in that big holiday season you get more in-store sales than online sales. But no, I mean, we’re delighted with the growth and that we anticipate continuing all the way through this year. I would just build on the comment that Steve made, but to give you an assumption of what the growth rate is, since we’re looking at a 16% growth rate and get into a stronger double digit number on it, it’s a little bit stronger than the 20% that Steve had. We’re looking at more of a mid-twenty number on that. So still strong growth on the e-Commerce channel. And to Steve’s further question, take a little bit of pressure off the store delta overall, because e-Commerce is continuing to grow strongly with strong traffic and conversion up nicely plan for in fiscal 2017. It’s actually Cody on for Adrian today. Just two quick questions here. One is on the promotional environment. I know you said Q4 was a bit more promotional than you guys have seen. What are you seeing so far in Q1? And then what are your expectations for Q4, or through the rest of the year? I think it’s [simul simul]. I think Q1 is – we’re seeing the same, the same retailers coming out with pretty much the same – similar to last year. So honestly, I don’t see much different from this time last year. Our position was to be more aggressive and more proactive on that, so not waiting till the end of the season, so that’s a big change for us. But we think the promotional pattern is going to be really consistent as we saw last year throughout the entire year. We all talk about the promotional environment, at some point we’re going to have to just all stop talking about it because it’s just going to be the retail environment and it will have our own sort of cadences of promotions to gain or maintain our market share. So I don’t think that it’s changing very rapidly compared to what we have seen. And then just as far as your CRM capabilities and some of the systems that you guys have put in place recently, are there any learnings that you can share about your customer? I know you shared some data early in the call, but any additional color on the learnings that you have about your customer and what you’re seeing and what you hope going forward? Thanks for asking that question because it just gives us an opportunity to kind of brag about that a little bit. I mean, I think it’s a terrific foundation for us as we move forward. I mean, we’re doing all the things you would expect us to see. I mean, it’s allowing us to segment our database a lot more effectively in terms of what customers are spending on, which merchandise categories, and the frequency of their spend so we can do our targeting for reactivation and frequency building. And if you can imagine that basically we have now, with our CRM, we have full transparency about who our customers are and their entire spending patterns and you can imagine that is an incredible place for us to go and look for intelligence that had to speak to, she wants to be spoken to. So it’s a big, big deal for us. I wanted to follow-up on last two topics, CRM and something earlier on marketing. I think by our math, the marketing expenditures will be up about 30% in the first half of the year. Obviously there’s a return to television you referenced, but some new tools that you referenced like the CRM. I guess, Alex and Jeff, as you think about that incremental marketing spend, are you leveraging new tools here in the first half? And do you have a sense of your ability to maybe get a better payback on those incremental marketing dollars? And if that doesn’t come to fruition, what’s your willingness to maybe dial that back here in the first half of the year? Well, I mean, of course, as you know, once you’re committed to your marketing, the costs are a certainty and the benefits you anticipate. So as far as Q1 is concerned, we’re in the [cost certainty] mode at the moment. And we have not built huge incremental sales growth as a result of that. We want to see how efficacious they are. But we are assuming as we go into the back half that we will start to get some payback. As far as dialing back is concerned, I mean, you can always dial back. But on a good chunk of what we are doing, I mean, the return on investments that we’ve got out of our print and our digital and we’ve talked about that a lot in terms of retention of frequency from our known customers has been amazing. So we certainly won’t be dialing that back. And certainly on the digital side, we’ll be spending a little more in 2017 than 2016. And I would just add on the television side we do have some strong analytical tools and techniques that are going to give us some better insights into what that payback is. So we are measuring how television is operating in kind of different levels of TV. We think it’s going to be really helpful going forward. To just add a point that you made, Brad, which is possibly it could be a lot more powerful to heavy up the spending on it if it’s working very well or we can dial it back somewhat. So we’ll get a better read, but it’ll take us this quarter to be out there for X number of weeks in the quarter and read the performance and then determine what we do with the marketing spend. But we’re definitely committed in the first quarter. Anything we would do would just be in the back half from those learnings. And then I think Alex, in your prepared remarks, you referenced a store of the future if I heard you correctly. When might that be something that we might see out in the field and what changes might be in store to the extent you can share them with us right now? I have nothing that we can share with you today, but absolutely we will share with you when it’s a little more finalized. And we’re really just working with a design company, we’re starting with a blank sheet of paper and say, okay, in this world that we now live in, what could a store be like over the next few years. So we’re not going to be refurbishing the whole chain anytime soon as you would imagine. So I think more to come on that. I’ll talk to you more about it on the next call. Most of my questions have been answered, but just from a housekeeping standpoint, I think you guys guided to about 39.5% tax rate for the year. You guys have been materially below that for a very long time now, sort of why the tax rate would be up so much in 2017? Structurally, we tend to run at that 39% plus level. We are fortunate the last few years to have discrete items that drive that down. And you can never predict those, just from a planning standpoint, we’re using the higher tax rate until we successfully have some individual items take that rate down. So 39.5%, we should be [fine at], but obviously we’ll try to work real hard with items so we can take that tax rate down. It’s Dolph in for Dan. Quick question on the fulfillment. You’ve been reporting two thirds of e-Commerce has been fulfilled for the past year. Is that a number that can change in the coming year? It’s actually remarkably stable and it’s been remarkably stable since we started e-Comm. We don’t get wide fluctuations at all. So I think that’s a number we’re assuming in terms of planning our fulfillment capability. We’re not pushing it one way or the other. She is deciding how she want to deliver and fairly consistently it’s been about this two thirds level. And if I may just follow-up on the CapEx, realizing it came down a lot this past year, it’s guided to be up a little bit in this coming year. Looking ahead, as you complete projects and you close stores, is there more room for it to come down in fiscal 2018? Probably not, Dan, it might just be a little bit of conservative posturing on that. Some of the conversation we had about relocation program for the future, it might change from IT or DC to more store based on it or it might go to more DC. So we’re still planning mid-$50 million to $60 million of CapEx, anticipating there are going to be some high return projects coming out either for DC automation, optimization opportunities and/or growth in terms of store relocations and new store formats and things. So I still plan a little conservatively to keep that number at least $50 million and probably closer to $60 million consistent with 2017. I wanted to see if you can share more details about the loyalty program and which are the three pilot markets you’re testing it in and what the response rate has been so far? So as you know, we have the very successful Pier 1 rewards credit card and we have two tiers for that, we have the regular card and we have the platinum customers. So what we have created with loyalty is as an entry level program it is multi-tender loyalty, so for those customers who either can’t or don’t want to sign up for a credit card, they can still be part of our loyalty scheme. And we have a series of benefits for customers who are in the loyalty program, not as rich obviously as those who are in the rewards card program because we don’t want to cannibalize that in any way. Our test markets are California, Hawaii and Alaska. It’s been running now for a couple of weeks or so and it’s a great market to test in because as you know our ability to [indiscernible] prior to this was practically nonexistent. So we are really pleased with the early rates. And one last one for Jeff, what are you building in for share purchases for this year? Are you just assuming you complete what’s remaining in the authorization? No, we haven’t gone quite that far overall, but our average shares are going to come down from about 83 million now to about 80 million shares outstanding. So we’re going to assume on average close to 3 million, 3 million plus shares to come out. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.
