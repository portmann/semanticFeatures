Dish Network presses FCC to reject Verizon-XO dealings - DISH Network Corporation (NASDAQ:DISH) | Seeking Alpha May  4 2016, 15:18 ET | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Dish Network ( DISH -2.9%) has filed a lengthy brief with the FCC asking it to deny approval for Verizon's ( VZ +0.2%) $1.8B purchase of XO Communications's fiber-optic business as well as related moves. Verizon also leased XO's wireless spectrum (via XO unit Nextlink Wireless) with a purchase option. The moves would give Verizon near-exclusive control of 5G spectrum, Dish Network argues. That would hinder competition overall in the 5G market, as well as current/future competition between Verizon and XO in fiber/wireless mobile backhaul, Internet transit, and enterprise and wholesale markets. Verizon structuring the deal as a transfer lease avoided some scrutiny, Dish says, but the spectrum is the key to the deal. Good - drop Yahoo, sell AOL, settle labor issues and cut Lowell McAdam's salary and bonuses by 3/4's .. better yet give him the boot.. then we can be bullish on yet another 1 + billion dollar purchase. This is what VZ should be focused on - not buying defunct dotcoms, trying to become a content provider and bring back the days of "Internet portals" which went way of the dinosaur.
