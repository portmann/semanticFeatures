Apple Is Doing The Right Thing With iPhone 7 - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple is widely criticized for moving from a "tick-tock" to a "tick-tock-tock" iPhone design cycle at a time when its business is slowing. Apple's goal and product development strategy for the iPhone are often misunderstood. With the iPhone 7, Apple aims to walk a fine line between shipping meaningful features and not over serving the increasingly mature and diverse smartphone market. Investors should think about the iPhone business' success no longer in terms of further growth, but rather in terms of steady sales, consistency, and sustainability. It feels like everything we knew about the iPhone business has changed. For the first time in the product's history, iPhone revenue is no longer growing. Gone is the predictability of the tick-tock cycle, with this year's model (expected to be called the iPhone 7) rumored to largely retain the design of the current iPhone 6S. And in another first, Wall Street Journal already reports on the next year's iPhone which is said to bring a revolutionary redesign eschewing the home button for an all-screen front. All of this unpredictability then naturally leads to increased investor anxiety and questions about the future revenue trajectory of Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) most important product. Is Apple making a mistake with the iPhone 7, pushing the redesign to next year at a time when its business is slowing? When discussing the iPhone's design and features, it is important to consider Apple's goal and product development strategy for its flagship product. The company's long-time tick-tock product cycle has led some to believe that it is to introduce a new design in the tick years and component improvements in the tock years. But this is not the case. Instead, Apple's goal is to continuously deliver the best mobile experience on the market. With control over most of the elements of the iPhone experience (hardware, software, services, retail, and service support), Apple has quite a few opportunities to constantly push it forward. Instead of asking if the next iPhone will represent a big change, I think the more appropriate question for a long-term investor is: Is Apple constantly improving the benefits related to buying, owning, using, getting support for, and reselling an iPhone? The design of the 6/6S model has greatly advanced the experience of using the iPhone. The smartphone has a large screen, yet it is thin, light, and easy to hold. The combination of aluminum and glass offers a premium look while the rounded edges provide comfort and enable software features like edge-to-edge swiping. Would Apple change this successful design just so it could better market the next model and give users the emotional benefit of owning an iPhone with an all new look? I think this would be a risky strategy which would inevitably lead to neglecting some of the more crucial aspects of the smartphone design. Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) and its Galaxy S6 is a case in point, with the product losing the much advertised waterproofness of its predecessor due to the company's focus on a new premium design. Apple's design considerations are much broader than just physical appearance. The following graphic shows how the iPhone 7's rumored design would actually improve on quite a few design attributes: Decidedly, a larger screen within the existing form factor would represent the next major step for the iPhone's design. Increasing the screen real estate without making the product larger, thicker, heavier, and more difficult to hold would significantly improve the mobile experience. We know from the WSJ report that Apple is working on such a redesign and wants to achieve it by removing the home button and building the speaker and Touch ID components into the display. However, that represents a significant, multi-year effort as on top of technology development, Apple also needs to take into account the user behavior. The home button has been a crucial part of the iPhone's navigation for the past 9 years and its sudden removal would negatively impact the user experience. Instead of making iPhone users go through a steep learning curve, Apple has been gradually introducing new hardware (3D Touch) and software (3D Touch-based iOS features like peek and pop, app switching, and widgets) which aim to facilitate such a change over several product cycles. Apple has a long-term iPhone development strategy which does not aim to ship a new design every two years for the purpose of differentiation, marketing, and novelty value, but rather uses design as a means to advance the user experience, even if it takes time. This is the right approach leading to sustainability and long-term success. Almost every new iPhone cycle comes with the traditional criticism of evolutionary instead of revolutionary features, lack of innovation, and overall product fatigue. In this respect, this year is no different with complaints about the upcoming iPhone's rumored incremental improvements like a faster SoC, better camera, or increased storage options. The general belief is that to fight declining sales, Apple needs to step up its game and deliver new revolutionary features which would motivate customers to upgrade. However, I don't think this would help. Despite Apple's best efforts to push the mobile experience in the recent years with game-changing features like the 64-bit SoC, Touch ID, Apple Pay, and 3D Touch, the latest research from CIRP shows that US customers are actually holding onto their iPhones longer. Here's CIRP: "Over the past almost three years the average age of a new iPhone buyer's previous iPhone has increased by approximately three months." - Mike Levin, CIRP I think the following factors have a negative impact on the length of the iPhone's upgrade cycle: iPhone's increasing maturity. The slowing upgrade cycle suggests that specifications and features of the latest iPhone models increasingly meet the users' needs. New carrier financing plans. The carrier industry's move from two-year service contract subsidies to new monthly installment plans results in customers saving money after they have paid their smartphones in full, instead of upgrading more often. At this point, a case could be made that by doubling down on shipping more features, Apple could actually over serve its varied user base where early adopters, technology enthusiasts, and pro users no longer represent the majority. The growing user diversity will then further lead to increased segmentation of the iPhone product line - something which can already be seen with the feature set of the Plus models. From what we know about the upcoming iPhones, Apple is walking a fine line between shipping meaningful features which advance the mobile experience, and not over serving the increasingly mature smartphone market. While there is still a lot of innovation left in the smartphone, I think we should realign our expectations and objectives with the current smartphone market reality and think about the iPhone business' success no longer in terms of further growth, but rather in terms of steady sales, consistency, and sustainability. Apple's plans for the iPhone 7 and next year's model then suggest that the Cupertino, CA company has a good chance of meeting such criteria. With regards to growth, that is more likely to be found in Apple's new wearables and transportation initiatives.
