Why Apple's Best Days Could Be In The Rear-View Mirror - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. Apple iPhone accounted for $152 billion or 65% of revenue, which leaves the company very little wiggle room to grow the top line/bottom line without smartphone industry growth. A growing risk of "satisfied" smartphone users could stall smartphone growth and result in an annual decline in smartphone growth for years to come. Without a new catalyst up Apple’s sleeves to drive upgrades and conversions from other manufacturers Apple’s handset growth will slow significantly for the foreseeable future, in-line with the industry trend. The Chinese top seven cellphone makers continue to gain market traction, having seen their total market share grow from 22% in 2013 to 34% in 2015 on 437 million shipments. In 2016 91% of new phones sales will come from existing subscribers, which means there is very limited upside growth potential from new subscribers. Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPhone 6 and 6s hit it out of the park, mainly driven by the company's decision to launch two bigger devices to compete with every other smartphone provider in the world. Apple was the last to arrive at the 4.5-inch plus smartphone party and scooped up a fair share of conversions from other manufacturers and convinced existing Apple customers to go with the 4.7-inch or 5.5-inch Apple iPhone 6. Apple also was able to successfully pass on an additional cost to consumers of $100 and priced the 5.5-inch model at $299 while it continued offering the 4.7-inch at its customary minimum price point of $199 for the latest and greatest model. However, Apple's recent success in Q4 2014 and throughout 2015 will likely never be duplicated again. The cellphone industry including smartphones will reach peak penetration by 2019 as global cellphone unit shipments continue to hover around 0% or negative growth for the foreseeable future. Chinese handset manufacturers have become increasingly more competitive in recent years and are forecasted to ship 437 million units in 2015, up from 355 million in 2014. I listed below some of the specifications related to the iPhone 5s through 6s to demonstrate the improvements driven by the annual iteration of the iPhone over the past three years (Source Trusted Reviews iPhone 6/6s and iPhone 5s ). iPhone 6S: Apple A9 64-bit dual-core 1.84GHz, PowerVR GT7600 GPU, 2GB RAM iPhone 6: Apple A8 64-bit dual-core 1.4GHz, PowerVR GX6450 GPU, 1GB RAM iPhone 5S: Apple A7 64-bit dual-core , PowerVR G6430 GPU, 1GB RAM, M7 co-processor iPhone 5s, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s side by side camera and video metrics: iPhone 6S: 12-megapixel, phase detection, dual LED "True Tone" flash, 4K video, 5-megapixel front camera iPhone 6: 8-megapixel sensor, digital optical image stabilization, TrueTone flash, face detection, 1.2-megapixel front-facing camera, 1080p HD video recording iPhone 5S: 8-megapixel sensor, 1.2-megapixel front-facing camera, 1080p HD video recording, TrueTone flash The iPhone 6 and 6s came with better performance versus the iPhone 5s due to improved processing speed, increased RAM along with a better camera, but the most desirable attribute was a larger screen (5.5"/4.7" versus 4"). Size matters and Apple seized the opportunity to jump start sales in 2014 with the introduction of the larger iPhone 6 line. However, without a new catalyst up Apple's sleeves to drive upgrades and conversions to Apple from other manufacturers, Apple's handset growth will slow significantly alongside industry expectations for the foreseeable future. Consumers in China were very excited about a larger iPhone because it finally provided enough screen space for Chinese letters to be drawn on the iPhone screen to improve electronic communication in Chinese via an iPhone. Although I believe Apple iPhone sales growth will stall in FY16 I do not expect an outright decline in Y-o-Y iPhone sales. On the other hand I do expect sales to grow well below the forecasted industry smartphone growth rate of just 12% in FY16. I'm currently modeling Apple iPhone sales of 230m for FY16 or an increase of 4% over the 221m forecasted in FY15. Over the past three years the smartphone industry growth rates have declined from 29% in 2014 and is forecasted to fall to 13% in 2015 and drop to 12% in 2016, according to IC Insights. Apple had meaningful market gains in Q4 2014 and throughout 2015 driven by the introduction of larger iPhones. Apple's market share was forecasted to grow 20% in 2015 by IC Insights or 7% above the industry forecasted growth rate of 13%. Apple and Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) combined for a 40% market share in 2014 with a drop to 39% in 2015. The biggest challenges that will impact iPhone sales going forward will be increasingly competitive offerings from China and a global smartphone market that's approaching full market penetration. Smartphones have become more reliable in terms of battery life and overall device performance and user experience continues to improve. The other trend that I expect to emerge that may crush smartphone growth for years to come is "satisfied" users. A large population of satisfied users would lengthen the replacement period and significantly impact annual growth rates. In Q4 2015, 80% of cell phone shipments are expected to come from smartphones. To put this in perspective in 2013, only 54% of cellphone sales came from smartphones. By 2019, 95% of total cellphone shipments are expected to come from smartphones. As a reminder smartphone sales only grew 4% in 2014 and are forecasted to decline 1% in 2015 and only grow 2% in 2016. IC Insights also provides some frightening statistics that could impact Apple's growth prospects over the next several years. The user base of mobile phones is approaching full market penetration, in other words in 2016 91% of new phones sales will come from existing subscribers (see image below). By 2019, 94% of expected new phone sales will come from existing subscribers meaning only 6% of new phone sales will come from new subscribers. Apple's iPhone product generated $152 billion of revenue or 65% of Apple's total 2016 revenue. However, the smartphone industry will reach full maturity by 2019 and overall industry sales will grow low single digits or more than likely decline on an annual basis. Seven of the top 12 Chinese cellphone makers continue to gain market traction having seen their total market share grow from 22% in 2013 to 34% in 2015 ( Source IC Insight ). A quick glance at Apple's FY15 results you can see how vulnerable and dependent the company is on iPhone revenue. iPad sales continue to decline Y-o-Y and revenue generated from service and other products including the Apple Watch are not material enough to offset any future weakness sales weakness of the iPhone. Image Source ( Apple FY15 10-K ) Net sales rose 28% or $50.9 billion during 2015 compared to 2014, driven by a 52% year-over-year increase in iPhone net sales. iPhone net sales and unit sales in 2015 increased in all of the Company's reportable operating segments. The Company also experienced year-over-year net sales increases in Mac, Services and Other Products. Apple Watch, which launched during the third quarter of 2015, accounted for more than 100% of the year-over-year growth in net sales of Other Products. Net sales growth during 2015 was partially offset by the effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and lower iPad net sales. Total net sales increased in each of the Company's reportable operating segments, with particularly strong growth in Greater China where year-over-year net sales increased 84%. ( Apple FY15 10-K ) The playing field for smartphones innovation and differentiation has plateaued and the industry as matured. Apple's most difficult task in the coming years will be producing an iPhone that separates itself from the pack or the company will continue to see growth rates decline as well as the company's share price. Apple's market cap peaked at $751 billion in April of 2015 and without the advent of additional products or sizeable mergers and acquisitions Apple's best days are likely behind them. The smartphone forecast for the foreseeable future will have a detrimental impact on Apple's iPhone sales growth rate and as a result Apple's market cap will never reach $1 trillion and is more likely than not to contract over the next several years.
