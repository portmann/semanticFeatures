Microsoft Beats Globalstar With The Ugly Stick - Globalstar, Inc. (NYSEMKT:GSAT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft has just posted a scathing letter to the FCC regarding a Globalstar interference demonstration. Microsoft's arguments and conclusion are extremely compelling and speak right to the core of the issue the FCC will have to decide on. Ultimately, I still think Globalstar is a short, but in this case I find that my thesis shifted somewhat for it to be a short. In a comments letter to the FCC just filed and made public, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) has posted significant criticism to Globalstar's (NYSEMKT: GSAT ) ambition of using its satellite spectrum in its TLPS (Terrestrial Low Power Service) scheme, as an additional Wi-Fi channel. Microsoft's criticism comes as an answer to a demonstration conducted by Globalstar at the student center of a college campus in Chicago, Illinois, This demonstration was meant to show that TLPS did not interfere with other Wi-Fi channels as well as Bluetooth. Establishing the lack of such interference is key for getting FCC approval of the spectrum for terrestrial usage. Beyond everything that's already been said regarding GSAT's ambitions and how they're unlikely to pay off, it's thus also noteworthy that Microsoft's opposition raises significant arguments which are likely to resound with the FCC. This is so because Microsoft strikes at the heart of what will matter most for the FCC: Microsoft believes Globalstar's broad claim that this demonstration shows "that there are no interference or compatibility issues between TLPS and Wi-Fi, nor with TLPS and Bluetooth operations in the 2.4 GHz ISM band" overstates the results to the point of being misleading. Why does Microsoft believe it's misleading, for a bevvy or reasons: Enterprise Grade Access Points Are Not Representative of the Installed Base of Wi-Fi Access Points And Wi-Fi Equipment. By this Microsoft means that the equipment used in GSAT's demonstrations was Enterprise Grade and thus with better filtering both of the transmitted and received signals. Since this equipment is but a small fraction of the deployed Wi-Fi equipment, and commercial or residential products are weaker in terms of filtering, the demos are not representative. Globalstar's Filing Lacks Information on the Operational Parameters Used During the Compatibility Demonstrations. By this Microsoft means that important parameters were not disclosed, rendering the demonstration meaningless. For instance, the most important parameter, total transmit power, was not disclosed. So the demo might have been run at a much lower transmit power than the one GSAT is seeking to have. Obviously, a lower transmit power will make for lower interference - but will also render the demo non-representative of what's being sought. This is also important in the regard that in a previous demo GSAT actually used transmit power levels well below (1/5th) what it is seeking. Microsoft also mentions the load factors of the network as not being known. Demonstrations Regarding TLPS Existence (interference) Were Extremely Short. Here, Microsoft argues that the testing done by GSAT to ascertain interference was not enough. There were just 2 tests done for Wi-Fi and 2 for Bluetooth, over a 2-day period, with each those tests always lasting less than 45 minutes. This is especially short since GSAT itself said conditions change significantly throughout the day, so testing for short bursts of time in just 2 single days is not representative of actual use, and thus of actual interference. Globalstar's Filing Did Not Address Important Use Cases Microsoft Has Identified. Here Microsoft argues that the environment and use cases GSAT tested for were not representative of what GSAT should have tested. Proposed Network Operating Systems Will Not Protect Broad Classes of Wi-Fi Users. Microsoft argues that GSAT's proposal does not defend a large part of the population using Wi-Fi, even if Globalstar limits itself to enterprise systems. Promises Alone Not to Utilize LTE-U Hold Little Value. Microsoft says that there's no certainty about GSAT never utilizing LTE-U technologies instead of Wi-Fi over the spectrum whose terrestrial usage it seeks approval for. Moreover, Microsoft claims doubts regarding whether the tests of Wi-Fi coexistence can be carried over to LTE-U. The overall problem, which Microsoft summarizes in its conclusion, is pretty simple (bold is mine): It has been almost two years since the Globalstar NPRM was adopted. In the intervening time, Globalstar could have tried to allay reasonable technical concerns expressed by a number of trade associations representing a cross section of unlicensed 2.4 GHz ISM users. Throughout this time, Globalstar has chosen not to conduct genuine testing, but instead, merely to conduct demonstrations. The Commission's technical rules are by their very nature data-driven. Data-driven approaches require analysis, modeling, and testing. The student center demonstrations that examined coexistence between TLPS and Wi-Fi and TLPS and Bluetooth fall significantly short of what is necessary to answer fundamental questions regarding such coexistence. One of the strongest parts of the short thesis on GSAT is that even if it gets FCC approval, the TLPS system will not be valuable. However, developments like those which took place today with Microsoft's reaction show that increasingly the problem is that it looks like TLPS won't even be approved. This powerful Microsoft criticism makes the thesis that GSAT won't get approval stronger still, especially because it strikes at the core of what might make FCC refuse approval. Namely, interference with other spectrum in general and the rest of the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth spectrum in particular - and the fact that no proper testing has been carried out yet to allay the possibility of such interference. I have for the most part been a subscriber to the thesis that GSAT would ultimately see its spectrum approved for terrestrial usage and that TLPS would ultimately go forward, but show itself to not be valuable, rendering GSAT a clear short. However, with reactions such as this one by Microsoft, along with the arguments it makes, I increasingly find it likely that GSAT won't even get FCC approval. Thus rendering it an even clearer short still. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information. We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.
