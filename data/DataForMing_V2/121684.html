A Look At Boeing's H1 Orders And Deliveries - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Boeing is on track to meet its delivery target for 2015. The company currently has a book-to-bill ratio of 0.85. In one of my previous articles I had a look at Boeing's Q1 orders and deliveries. Order inflow for widebody aircraft increased compared to last year Given the charge that Boeing recognized on the Boeing 767-2C development it is likely that Boeing will be trimming its EPS guidance, but if Boeing matches or even exceeds its guidance for cash flow and shows a strong cash flow a trimmed EPS guidance should not have a big impact on Boeing's stock price. In order to see whether Boeing is on its way to meet its target it is important to look at the orders and deliveries. Table 1: Deliveries Q2 2015 versus Q2 2014 and 2014 In Q1 Boeing deliveries fell short of expectations for the Boeing 737, for the 747, 767, 777 and 787 deliveries were in line with the announced production rates. During Q2 Boeing delivered more 737 airframes, partly compensating for lower deliveries in Q1 and also delivered more 747, 777 and 787 airframes. Boeing will be quite pleased with the fact that it managed to produce 34 Dreamliners versus the 30 Dreamliners that were scheduled, reflecting higher deliveries at the Everett and Charleston production sites. In total Boeing delivered 13 more airframes compared to the previous quarter and 16 more airframes compared to Q2 2014 delivery figures. Figure 1: Quarterly deliveries Boeing (Source: aeroanalysis.net ) Using the current production rates Boeing should be able to deliver about 190 aircraft per quarter or 760 airframes annually. So in the first quarter Boeing should have delivered about 380 airframes, which it did: Boeing delivered 381 airframes. Boeing, however, has put a delivery goal of 750-755 airframes for 2015 or approximately 188 airframes per quarter. This means that Boeing needs to deliver 185-186 airframes in the upcoming quarters and currently is ahead on schedule. Figure 1 shows that deliveries during Q1 were 4 airframes short to meet Boeing's annual target, but delivered 9 aircraft more than required in Q2. For the first half of 2015 Boeing is 5 airframes ahead on schedule. What bodes well for Boeing is that it managed to deliver 34 Dreamliners, while according to production rates it should have delivered 30 airframes. Figure 2: Quarterly deliveries Boeing 2014 and 2015 (Source: aeroanalysis.net ) Figure 2 shows that in 2014 the number of deliveries increased towards the end of the year, which probably is related to airlines wanting to receive their aircraft before the end of the year if possible. For 2015 Boeing does not necessarily need to increase deliveries towards the end of the year, which gives the company some breathing space. For 2015 Boeing aims for a book-to-bill ratio of 1, which means that the number of deliveries equals the order inflow. In 2014 Boeing booked 1423 orders and delivered 723 airframes, this is equivalent to book-to-bill ratio of almost 2. Table 2: Orders Q2 2015 versus Q2 2014 and Q1 2015 In the first 6 months of the year Boeing managed to secure 325 orders. In Q2 orders were up 80%, due to higher order inflow for the Boeing 737 and Boeing 777. Compared to last year orders in the second quarter were down 34%. In the first 6 months of 2015 Boeing delivered 381 airframes and secured 325 orders, which is equivalent to a book-to-bill ratio of .85. This is slightly below Boeing's target of receiving 1 order for each delivery. In Q2 Boeing's book-to-bill ratio equaled 1.06, up 0.43 from in the previous quarter. For Boeing it will be a challenge to secure enough orders to reach a 1:1 book-to-bill, but I do expect some order inflow towards the end of the year. Excluding the charge on the tanker program, Boeing should be able to report higher EPS Boeing probably will be lowering the EPS guidance for 2015, reflecting the charge it had to take on the tanker program Boeing should be able to reach a book-to-bill ratio of 1 During the earnings presentation most attention will go out to free cash flow and cost reductions on the Boeing 787 production Source: A Look At Boeing's H1 Orders And Deliveries Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.
