Harrison Ford uses the force for good | Reuters NEW YORK - The battered leather jacket worn by Harrison Ford in the latest â€œStar Warsâ€? movie has been put up for auction in New York to help a cause dear to the actorâ€™s heart. Ford, 73, signed and donated Han Soloâ€™s Â â€œStar Wars: The Force Awakensâ€? jacket to help raise money for research into epilepsy â€“ a condition he recently revealed that his adult daughter Georgia Ford suffers from. Harrison said he was impressed with the work done by the FACES (Finding a Cure for Epilepsy and Seizures) unit at New York Universityâ€™s Langone Medical Center. â€œI hope this jacket will provide some means to further that exploration. This isÂ  a cause that is near and dear to me and unlike the cynical Han Solo, Iâ€™ve got a good feeling about this,â€? he said. Harrison told reporters earlier in March that his daughter Georgia, 26, had suffered seizures since she was a child and that doctors at the Langone Medical center had finally diagnosed epilepsy as the cause some eight years ago. Bidding for the leather jacket stood at $33,000 on Wednesday (March 30) and the online auction continues until April 11 at the website.
