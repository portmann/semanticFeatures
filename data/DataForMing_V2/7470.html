The Insane Apple Advantage Revisited - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple has historically had an insane advantage that few talk about, but is crucial for it being able to sell a massive number of high-priced iPhones. As it stands, this advantage might be narrowing significantly. If such narrowing is to persist, it might become a significant problem as soon as the iPhone 6S replacement cycle comes around, later in 2015. I've once written about an insane advantage Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has which is not talked about nearly enough given the importance it commands. I did this in my article appropriately titled " Another Insane Apple Advantage ." This advantage refers to the much higher resale value iPhones usually carry, which is part of the reason why people don't mind paying higher prices for them when buying them new. The example I used in that article referred to how the iPhone 4S, then a 2 year-old device possibly coming out of contract, could still be traded-in for as much as $205 to $253, which would be enough to pay the entire upfront cost on a new iPhone (then, the 5S) on contract ($199 for the base device). This meant that for the typical iPhone customer, getting the new iPhone on contract was basically free. At the same time, an equivalent high-end 2-year-old Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) device retained just around $40 in value. So while the iPhone customer could upgrade for free, the Samsung customer could not. The difference in values also reflected how consumers saw the devices' value and utility as they aged. And it certainly didn't look good for Android devices. I subscribe to eBay's (NASDAQ: EBAY ) Deals newsletter. In this newsletter one of the sections concerns smartphones, including older devices sold as new, refurbished or used. Lately, I had been noticing something curious. The prices on the discounted Android flagships from yesteryear started seeming not so different from those for the equivalent iPhones. Indeed, at one point I nearly bought an iPhone 5S to substitute my daughter's 5S since she let her's drop into water (it eventually recovered, so I no longer had to). At the time I saw these iPhone 5Ss going for as low $275 or so, which surprised me. Below is a printscreen from the typical eBay Deals newsletter, including several older iPhone models (though with somewhat less enticing prices). This led me to dig further. I wanted to know how things would look now if I applied the same logic from my past Apple article to today's 2-year-old phones. Back on October 2, 2013 I had some trouble matching the announcement/launch dates for the different devices. Naturally, Samsung tries not to have its own launches right on top of Apple's. This problem surfaced yet again this time around. A 2-year old Apple device would now be the iPhone 5 (announced on September 12, 2012). As for Samsung, it could either be the Samsung S4 (announced on March 14, 2013), the Samsung SIII (announced on April 3, 2012) or the Samsung Note II (announced on August 29, 2012). I went with the Samsung S4, since it's 2 generations behind the already-announced S6, much like the iPhone 5 is now 2 generations behind the iPhone 6. But I will also provide data for the Samsung SIII and Note 2, given that the Samsung S6 is not yet shipping. There was also the question of which specs to compare. In 2013, I used an AppleInsider article that actually used the highest-possible specs for the iPhone (unlocked; 64GB; flawless). This time around I will use the base model (unlocked/AT&T; 16GB storage; flawless) while also indicating the price I found for the highest-spec'd model (for comparison purposes). The reason is "liquidity." More of the base models are sold so it's easier to find more meaningful pricing data. So here is what I found: The iPhone's resale value advantage is mostly gone. There's just some doubt on whether to compare the iPhone 5 to the Samsung S4 or SIII/Note 2, but on market value (Glyde.com) both the Samsung S4 and even more surprisingly the older Note 2 already seem to have an higher market value than the iPhone 5. Furthermore, even the market value of a 2-year-old iPhone is now insufficient to pay for the subsidized pricing on the new iPhone. The guaranteed trade-in values are farther still (remember, on the previous article the trade-in values were more than enough, and obviously the market values actually provided a profit for the customer). This is true even for the high-end model (64GB), where the trade-in value is just $140 for the iPhone 5. What happened to the phones from the previous article? I've also gotten data for the same phones (iPhone 4S, Samsung SII) I used in the previous article, which would now be 3-4 years old. This is how they looked: We can see that with the passage of time the iPhone lost more value (around 70%) than the Samsung SII (around 50%). This made the older phones be closer, but an iPhone advantage still remained. It thus seems that Android's combination of hardware and software has gotten more valuable, relatively speaking, with the latest versions of Android (and devices). At the same time, older Android devices are still somewhat less valuable. This is consistent with Android getting relatively better and with the massive bet on higher specs over time by Android device makers. What about the most recent previous generation? Since I was all fired up, I decided to check on what had happened to the recent previous generation phones (iPhone 5S, Samsung S5). This is how they look: Amazingly, the Samsung S5 even commands an higher resale value at this point. However, we have to take this with a grain of salt since the Samsung S6 hasn't yet reached stores and the Samsung S5 is newer than the iPhone 5S. Still, all things considered, there seems to have been a significant equalization of trade-in and resale values between the highest-end devices of the Android world and the iPhone. There are two things to consider in this development: Apple lost relative resale value. This might have happened due to extreme demand for the iPhone 6 from customers wanting to upgrade due to display size. Such would increase supply of the iPhone 5S and other models. At the same time, demand for iPhone would now be focused on larger-display iPhones. The true test of this development will thus come when the iPhone 6 reaches the trade-in market. It might regain an advantage over Android/Samsung. Or not. On the other hand, Android clearly gained resale value. This points toward Android devices now being seen as valid choices instead of just cheaper second choices. After all, the phones we're comparing the iPhone to are also high-end devices that cost about the same when new. And now they're holding their value as well or nearly as well as the iPhone when used. This is a significant development. Perhaps it's also debatable whether Apple's enclosed battery is a factor in this development. Up until the Samsung S5, one could easily change its battery. And it's well known that batteries degrade over time, both due to cycling (charge and discharge cycles) and the simple passage of time. The iPhones come with particularly small batteries, which at times expose them to even more aggressive cycling. And changing a battery if done at an Apple store isn't particularly cheap ($79 if I am not mistaken). In this regard, the resale value of iPhones might be suffering from the same effect that hits cars known to have expensive components fail regularly. Such an effect can easily negate Apple's positive effect from its brand. That said, from the Samsung S6 onward, Samsung seems to have decided to also use enclosed, non-removable, batteries. It might pay to monitor what happens to the resale value of the Samsung S6 over time and how it compares to the iPhone 6. Any development regarding the iPhone franchise is extremely important for Apple. Apple is, for all purposes, the iPhone. Nearly all of Apple's value comes from the iPhone. In the December 2014 quarter, more than 68% of Apple's revenues and around 80% of its profits came from the iPhone. It is arguable that 4/5ths of Apple's value thus comes from the iPhone franchise. This is the reason why any advance from Android, be it on market share, be it on cameras catching up to the iPhone, be it on Android devices catching up on resale value, is significant. Indeed, I covered all of these In my last three Apple articles: Apple: Winning The Profit Battle, Losing The Smartphone War : This is on how Android's large market share can end up having significance for developers. Android has already just about reached parity in terms of apps. If Android manages to get a clear lead on apps, it would be extremely bad for Apple. This is a possible long-term development; Apple: More Data On The iOS/Android Struggle : Adds data to the previous article, showing how the trends already favor Android, even if Android starts from behind in terms of usage; Apple: Android Photography Is About To Take A Huge Quality Jump : Shows how Android cameras have been disadvantaged on mid-tier phones. Also shows how this is about to change significantly. Here I have to add that this Android disadvantage hasn't existed for a while in high-end Android phones - hence perhaps the ease with which they managed to regain relative sales value compared to the iPhone. To this we can now add that the iPhone's massive resale value advantage seems to have washed away significantly. As several of these trends combine and synergize, the risks grow stronger and stronger for Apple. Yet, even this development regarding sales value will take time to produce effects. The notion of resale value filters slowly through the masses. That said, other than its brand, its resale value was perhaps the biggest advantage Apple had. And that now seems to be gone, at least when compared to old Samsung phones. In spite of this clearly being a negative development, it has no bearing on the revenues and profits Apple is bound to report in the short-term. Indeed, if anything there are a couple of reasons to believe that the next few quarters will actually enjoy improved margins due to: Apple using much lower spec'd components in its own Phones This wasn't always a fact. In the past Apple usually tried to be at the cutting edge of technology, but now consider: The iPhone's display on the iPhone 6 plus has a 1080p resolution, which is what you expect to find in mid-tier Android phones today. Apple uses an even lower resolution display on the iPhone 6, near the kind of resolution you're starting to see in entry-level Android phones. Although the panels themselves are high quality, they are very far from the state-of-the-art right now, which uses higher resolution panels, OLED panels, etc. The iPhone's battery is nearly half the size of what you find in even mid-tier Android phones. While the iPhone uses intrinsically less energy due both to its CPU tradeoff and to the iOS structure (not allowing true multitasking), this means that now the iPhone has similar battery life to everything else out there. Apple could have used a battery closer to what is in the majority of Android phones and it would then have much longer battery life. It didn't. And now there's the further risk that Android 5.0, when apps start using all of its potential, will lead to even longer battery life on Android devices. The iPhone's CPU helps the iPhone use less energy. But part of it comes from using lower frequencies in its CPU cores. The cores are optimized for single-thread performance so the iPhone usually doesn't lose anything in terms of performance in spite of using less energy. However, as more and more apps start using more CPU cores, the SoCs (System On a Chip) used in Android phones are starting to gain a performance advantage in multi-core processing. The iPhone's camera uses a derivative of the Sony (NYSE: SNE ) Exmor RS IMX145 and a lens which still sits at f/2.2. And only the iPhone 6 plus offers OIS (Optical Image Stabilization). This, again, is not particularly state-of-the-art. Apple's advantage has come mostly from post-processing. As Android gets nearer to being able to deliver the necessary post-processing even in mid-tier phones, it's probable that a whole lot of cheap phones will start matching the iPhone's image quality. The same goes for the pitiful 1.2MP front-facing camera, which is now far from acceptable in a selfie-obsessed world. The iPhone's storage starts at just 16GB on the base model, and upgrades for larger capacities are incredibly expensive. Both the base storage and upgrade prices on many Android phones are a significant advantage. The iPhone's RAM (Random Access Memory) stands at just 1GB. Android phones routinely come with 2-3GB now. 1GB is for low-end phones. Over time the usage of very low memory capacities means that the older devices go obsolete much easier as they end up not having enough RAM to run upgraded OSs and newer apps. Indeed, while Android is always being berated for being difficult to upgrade (through manufacturers/mobile operators), the fact is that even old devices sometimes get upgrades to much more recent Android versions. This happens through a cottage industry that produces ROMs for old devices (the best-known of the companies doing this is Cyanogen). This is only possible because Android phones come with much better internals, allowing them to last much more before going totally obsolete. In time this might also favor Android's resale value. All in all, and as many say, the iPhone is not about specs. It's about the whole experience and the brand. But still, as Android phones gain in relative resale value, something seems to be changing. Perhaps the experience is not that different. The brand value, of course, still is. Anyway, the usage of all those lower-spec components means that Apple is enjoying cheaper and cheaper sourcing costs for its flagship phones. In the near term this greatly helps margins. Indeed a recent IHC teardown put the cost of the base iPhone 6 at just $200. Compare that to the Samsung S5's teardown , putting the cost at $256 for a phone selling for around the same price or cheaper. This difference promises to be even larger with the Samsung S6, too. From the same teardown named in the preceding paragraph, we find that the iPhone 6 has a BOM (Bill Of Materials, including manufacturing) of around $200. The iPhone 6 plus on the other hand, has a BOM of $216. Yet, the iPhone 6 plus costs $100 more than the iPhone 6! The margin on those extra $100 is obviously large, so Apple is gaining from having the higher-margin iPhone 6 plus constituting a part of its sales which did not exist in the previous iPhone cycle. On top of this, it's possible that customers will increasingly migrate towards opting for at least the 64GB storage versions. Again, the incremental margin is significant as those 48GB of additional storage also cost the consumer $100 more. What this means is that Apple is likely to gain margin not just from using lower-spec components but also from seeing an improved sales mix consisting of more expensive and higher-margin products. All in all, the margin picture looks great for Apple for the next few quarters, unless iPhone sales somehow falter. And there is no sign of them faltering just yet. But as much as people think that the iPhone is all about the experience, there's an embedded risk in following this strategy. Over time consumers might start seeing that their phone is being matched even by mid-tier Android phones on said experience. That's not something you want to happen. A previously tremendous Apple advantage which I had correctly identified in the past now seems to be going away. Apple used to enjoy a massive lead in resale value. Apparently, that's no longer the case even if it's likely that an iPhone is easier to sell than anything else. I would rate this particular advantage as being Apple's second most important advantage, with Apple's brand being the first. As such, this development is, once again, worrisome. It joins other present and future developments which will also slowly eat away at Apple's overall advantage. That said, this should not have an impact in the short-term. However, if come the replacement cycle from the iPhone 6 to the 6S this lack of superior resale value is still present, it might start being a problem for sales. I say this because the jump from the iPhone 5S to the larger display on the iPhone 6 might have moved a lot of customers which would otherwise not have moved without such a revolutionary change, in the face of a severely reduced trade-in value. In short, this is one more factor that is slowly changing against Apple. The moves are glacial and Apple's recent massive growth in terms of revenues and profits might well overshadow them. Yet, the data says that this move is, indeed, happening. Caution is warranted. Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
