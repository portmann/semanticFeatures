Boeing: An Unattractive Risk-Reward Play - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Boeing currently is trading at fair value. Reasonable price targets for 2016 are between $140 and $150. Price targets higher than $175 are not realistic for the moment. Boeing (NYSE: BA ) shares have lost 10.2% of their value year-to-date. In this article I will look whether Boeing shares are fairly valued in my view or what would be a fairer value. Additionally, I will explain why Boeing shares might currently not be trading near their fair value. Looking at the 5-year chart for Boeing a few things can be seen. In 2012 Boeing saw its stock prices skyrocketing. After that the stock lost 5% in 2014, followed by a 11% gain in 2015. It is needless to say that investors have not been able to choose a clear direction since the explosive growth in 2013. Comparing the year-to-date performance of Boeing to that of the Dow Jones, the aerospace sector (NYSEARCA: XAR ) and sector peers such as Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT ) and Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC ), it can be seen that Boeing's performance is exceptionally weak. While the Dow Jones won 4.15%, Boeing lost 10.2% and belongs to the bottom half of the Dow Jones from a performance point of view. The XAR, the aerospace & defense ETF, won 5.26% and is outperforming the Dow Jones slightly. Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman outperformed the Dow Jones and XAR, gaining 9.4% and 13.5% respectively. BA PE Ratio (NYSE: TTM ) data by YCharts Looking at the price-to-earnings it can be seen that Boeing is currently trading at a twelve-month trailing price multiple of 17.55. Lockheed and Northrop Grumman are trading at price multiples of 21 and 19.5. A price multiple of 19.5 would imply a 'fair' value of $144.24 or 11% upside for Boeing shares. This is also the value Boeing was trading at in better days. However, given Boeing's challenges , I think that price multiples of 19.5 or 21 are not justified for Boeing. From the companies in the Aerospace & Defense Industry, only General Dynamics (NYSE: GD ) and Textron (NYSE: TXT ) have a lower price multiple. The average price multiple is around 19, so sector performance for Boeing would imply a fair value of $140.55. Currently I do not see any reason that justifies the assumption of sector performance valuation for Boeing. Taking into account full year earnings, forecasted at $8.47, and a P/E multiple of 17.55 Boeing could be trading at $148.65 by the time it reports its 2016 full year results. One of the things that investors like a lot is earnings growth. What they like even more is valuing that growth in the current share prices. For 2016, Boeing expects earnings to come in between $8.45 and $8.65 per share or a forward multiple of 15-15.5. The forward P/E-ratio for the aerospace industry is 16.4. This means that, taking into account future earnings and the sector forward price multiple, Boeing should be trading between $137 and $142. The consensus EPS estimate of $8.47 would imply a share price of $138.91 or 7%. Another way to value growth is with the PEG-ratio or the price-to-earnings-to-growth ratio. Boeing reported earnings of $7.44 per share in 2015. This means that the company anticipates earnings growth of 13.6%-16.3% per share in 2016. If we calculate the PEG-ratio, using the 1-year growth rate, we obtain PEG-ratios of 1.07-1.28. What this tells us is that the stock looks slightly overvalued, but it is not worrying. Using the consensus estimate of $8.47, the PEG-ratio is 1.27. This also signals a slight overpricing. For the coming 4 years an annual growth of 16% is expected. If we translate this to a PEG-ratio we get a ratio of 1.09. Determining a real fair value based on price multiples and growth is difficult, not only because of the various methods that can be applied but also because of the different earnings estimates. Additionally, some of the stock price is driven by hopes on dividend increases or stock repurchases. This also means that every investor, based on their investing style will be willing to pay a different price for Boeing shares. Using the PEG-ratios I think Boeing is valued nicely. Given, the current expected earnings growth for either this year or for the next 4 years Boeing is valued fairly. Looking at price multiples, a reasonable price target would be around $148, indicating 13% upside to be achieved by the time Boeing reports 2016 full year results. In a bullish market $161 would be a good price target. Given the current expected growth, price targets north of $175 are not realistic at this point. Now, what you might ask yourself is why I marked Boeing as a play with an undesirable risk-reward ratio. This has everything to do with the dynamic landscape Boeing is facing, which currently is not making Boeing very attractive. Boeing is facing a potential charge related to accounting practices on the Dreamliner and 747 program that might eat away almost 2 years of profits. Additionally, fears on economic slowdowns and low oil prices are not things Boeing's business fares well on. Once oil prices are heading higher again and there are no problems with Boeing's accounting practices and forecasts, higher stock prices are justified. For the investors that are willing to take the risk you can now buy shares for a fair price and if the accounting problems turn out to be minor, you will be rewarded with a solid ride upwards. Describing Boeing's current situation: Boeing currently is trading at fair value and does offer some upside looking at the 2016 consensus estimate, but at an unattractive risk-reward ratio. Once the challenging landscape normalizes, Boeing shareholders will benefit from the strong expected earnings growth.
