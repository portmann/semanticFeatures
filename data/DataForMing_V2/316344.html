In September 2015, Verizon's board approved a 2.7% dividend increase which raised its annualized dividend to $2.26 per share. This was the ninth consecutive year that its board approved a dividend increase, affirming their confidence in the strength of the company's future cash flows. The company's free cash flow in 2015 was at $21.2 billion while its paid dividends were at $8.5 billion, making the full year free cash flow dividend payout ratio 40%.

The company posted revenue of $34.3 billion in the period, surpassing the consensus estimate of $34.1 billion. Verizon showed earnings per share surprise in all its previous four-quarters, as shown in the table below. In 2015, Verizon delivered strong and balanced results in a dynamic competitive environment while returning more than $13.5 billion to shareholders. At the same time, Verizon built and acquired next-generation network capabilities that position the company to be an innovator in the digital-first mobile world in 2016 and beyond. On the fourth-quarter conference call, CFO Fran Shammo said that the company is confident in its three-tier strategy of leading at the network connectivity level in the markets it serves, developing new business models through global platforms in video and Internet of Things, and creating certain opportunities and applications and content for incremental monetization.

Verizon wireless segment accounted for 69.7% of the company revenues in 2015, and the total wireless revenue grew 4.6% year-over-year. However, what is most encouraging, in my opinion, is the margin expansion. Segment EBITDA margin increased to 38.4% in the last quarter from 32.6% in the same quarter a year ago. For the total year 2015, wireless EBITDA margin was at 42.5% compared to 40.2% in the previous year. In my view, the strength and the leading position of Verizon's wireless business can be deduced from its behavior in front of the competition. Despite increased competition from T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS ) and extreme discounts from Sprint (NYSE: S ), Verizon has repeatedly emphasized that it is looking for profitable subscriber growth rather than trying to follow T-Mobile and Sprint cut-rate offers. That can be seen in the company's operating metrics. Verizon added 1.5 million net postpaid subscribers in the fourth quarter of 2015, of which 449,000 were postpaid phone net adds. I see robust growth prospects for the company. Verizon remains committed to consistently investing in its networks for the future. Its 2015 investments have positioned it for growth and allow it to maintain its network leadership position, as consistently acknowledged by third parties.

Verizon continued to invest in its 4G LTE network to provide the industry's highest reliability and position it to capture the efficiencies and capabilities of new technologies. The company is expanding capacity through a number of optimization techniques, effectively managing its spectrum, and further successfully densifying urban markets. According to the company, national studies recognize Verizon as the overall 4G LTE network performance leader, leading in categories of overall performance, network reliability, network speed, data performance and call performance. These are the performance metrics that matter to the customer. Wireline broadband Internet and fiber optic TV services [Fios] are also growth areas for Verizon. Fios continues to be the driver of consumer revenue growth. Total Fios revenue grew 6.8% in the last quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago.
