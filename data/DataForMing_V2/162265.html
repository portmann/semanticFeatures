Facebook: Undervalued When Viewing Peer Group P/E Multiple - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Facebook has seen shares fall as a result of recent macro volatility. But what this has done is create an opening for a value buy when viewing Facebook in relation to comparable peers. Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) shares just put in a brutal August (-4.87%) after having a breakout July (9.61%). But with the entirety of the August selloff, in my opinion, being macro-fear driven, I think it's important to remember that the core Facebook bull thesis and all that it encompasses still holds firm. A big part of that long-term bull thesis is in Facebook's superiority to peers when it comes to mobile user acquisition. This superiority was just confirmed by a polling done by Venture Beat Insights (VB Insights). VB Insights states, "… Facebook is outpacing every other available platform in user acquisition ((NYSE: UA )), and not by a little. Mobile publishers say that Facebook is 7X better at UA than its closest rivals." Obviously, this matters now, has mattered, and will continue to matter going forward. But I actually think the value-prop for Facebook's core platform (the Facebook-app at this point - although the polling is unclear as to whether it was directed at the app specifically or the comprehensive platform inclusive of Instagram, etc.) is growing and that Facebook's positioning in relation from a spatial standpoint could drive its share price higher by sheer force of EPS multiple expansion. When I look around tech in general, and I see a super high velocity of M&A for companies involved in mobile app consulting, optimization, and tailoring (as detailed a bit in a recent Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM ) note ), I think this lends itself well to the valuation for the platform for most effectively deploying mobile user acquisition strategies. I mean, if companies are getting frothy in buying companies that make the app experience catered towards user acquisition/retention once the user gets to the app what does that say about the value of the platform that directs the users in the first place? I think it says there's no way that Facebook should trade in line to "peers" from an EPS multiple standpoint - to which it does. Now, I put the words peers in quotations because frankly I don't view Facebook as having a peer. Clearly, neither do publishers/marketers/advertisers (see: polling sourced above). But I don't need to hammer that point home; I think we're all pretty much aware of that. So then, why is Facebook trading at 43X P/E when Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) trades at 47X P/E and Weibo (NASDAQ: WB ) trades at 51X? Is it a size issue? Do investors think that Facebook can't grow into a $253 billion market cap whereas the market thinks Yahoo can grow into its $30 billion market cap? Or is it a saturation issue? Because that doesn't really make sense either. It's way, way more efficient to grow margin when you don't have customer acquisition costs to offset. Facebook is largely working into its user base at this point. The hard part is over. I mean, LinkedIn (NYSE: LNKD ) trades at 80X P/E, although I will concede it's a much less mature overall model. I think that there's a valuation bull case to be made for Facebook and frankly, I would be saying the same thing at FB at $100. Apparently, the analyst community agrees with me. Analysts reporting to Thomson have a median price target for Facebook of ~$112 or ~25% higher from the most recent close. The high target on the Board is $143, which is where I could really see Facebook shares settling in if the market wanted to fairly value the company based on its positioning in the space. I just look at its P/E being in line with a Yahoo and I have to disagree with that. There's no way this should be taking place. Facebook also has near-term growth and value prop drivers that are high visibility. Instant Articles, Mentions, Moments, Lite, etc. Maybe the worst part about Facebook's current valuation is that all of this is known and all of this is modeled in. Guys, the analyst community, outside of pounding the table with price targets, has modeled in Facebook for sequential and rapid revenue, EBITDA, and EPS expansion for full year 2015, full year 2016, and full year 2016. What's even more egregious when viewing Facebook's comp company EPS multiple is that these estimates have all doubled since initiation thanks to positive revisions. I'll be clearer. Analysts typically initiate a cohort year (say 2017 estimates) several years in advance. They're sometimes lower at initiation than the actual results turn out to be as the actual calendar date moves closer to the cohort year being modeled, they're sometimes higher. A lot of change can happen in a few years. But rarely, at least in my following of analyst modeling, do you ever see estimates for such a highly followed company like Facebook doubling from initiation to realization. That's incredibly rare. But, that's exactly what's taken place with this name. For me, that obviously speaks to the constant innovation taking place at Facebook and is maybe the single largest reason why the stock should be valued at a premium to peers from a valuation multiple standpoint. It just should. Facebook, until it proves that it no longer can, should be valued at price plus premium to peers plus premium for forward-looking innovation. When viewing the company through that lens, the current EPS discount to peers is embarrassing. I think that Facebook is an excellent value buy at current pricing. I continue to recommend a long position and I continue to be long via long-dated CALL options. Disclosure: I am/we are long FB. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
