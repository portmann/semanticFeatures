Fitbit: A One-Trick Pony? - Fitbit, Inc. (NYSE:FIT) | Seeking Alpha To date, Fitbit has presented outstanding returns to investors. These returns are based more on emotion and hype than solid fundamentals. As such, Fitbit could be classified as a momentum stock, and the punishment could be severe if Fitbit fails to deliver. The risk makeup of Fitbit is skewed toward the downside. Stay away from Fitbit and invest in safer harbors; resist the illusion of easy money. I'm wary of one-trick ponies, especially companies that are one-trick ponies. The stock market investor's mantra continuously espouses diversification, so investing in a company that only offers one product or service seems to conflict with that rule. So when I look at companies like Fitbit (NYSE: FIT ), my suspicions are immediately raised. Essentially, investors are looking at a company with just a single product offering that is relatively devoid of potential. The stock chart, which lacks any substantial history, may offer an optimistic picture, but the fundamentals of the company paint a different scene. Currently, Fitbit offers a small selection of its exercise bands, including its zip, one, flex, charge, chargeHR, surge, and aria products. The products, which have varying levels of features, generally keep track of metrics such as distance travelled and calories burned, give caller IDs, show the time, have alarms, and are able to sync wirelessly with your other devices. Fitbit charges, depending on the device, prices in the range of $60 - $250. Now the question is: Will Fitbit be able to generate profits for its shareholders? Investors seem to think so, as shown by the rapid surge in share price after the Company's IPO in mid-July . At an IPO price of $20 per share, investors have received a return on investment of more than 100%. However, as many a company has shown before, IPOs that generate lots of fanfare tend to bleed uncontrollably as the months go by. Fitbit's products cater to the health-conscious, developed country citizen in a middle class to upper-middle class demographic. Furthermore, Fitbit's products are more discretionary, meaning that in lean times, the average consumer will not consider a Fitbit wristband on his or her shopping list. Categorizing Fitbit's products as discretionary makes the Company a riskier investment, and historically, discretionary stocks have returned the most hurt during economic meltdowns. While it is true that consumer trends are blowing toward heathier seas, the target population that Fitbit has selected for its products is simply too small to sustain the hefty growth that investors in Fitbit are likely expecting given the stock's momentum characteristics. Investors may see several quarters of rapid growth, but then what? Fitbit only markets a small collection of products that are geared toward the same idea, and investors have no track record of innovation that companies like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) have to examine. Should Fitbit fail to innovate, develop new products, and sustain growth, then the stock may end up deflating very quickly. Speaking of companies like Apple, Fitbit is up against mounds of competition. Apple has also decided to jump into the wearables industry with the Apple Watch, and Apple's product is finding a favorable crowd . Although one could argue that the Apple Watch and Fitbit's products are aimed at different markets (since the Apple Watch is more targeted toward general users), Apple's enormous loyal customer following has (almost always) favorably received Apple's products, and Apple will (or maybe even already has) encroached upon Fitbit's market share. The bottom line is that Fitbit simply doesn't have enough oomph to keep things going. Of course, there's always the chance that Fitbit will be able to innovate with new products, penetrate new markets, or do something to keep the engine running, but right now, I just don't see that happening. When I evaluate investment opportunities, I look at the risk makeup of the investment. What I see in Fitbit is a greater probability of the stock going belly up and a lower probability of the stock reaching new heights, and that is not something I like to see. On the other hand, companies like Apple, which continue to deliver strong and steady, but not outrageous, returns to investors attract my attention. There is a greater probability of upside than downside, even though the absolute returns might be lower. So, in short, investor beware: Fitbit may already be teetering on the end of its rope. If you must invest in Fitbit, at least look at purchasing protective put options or investing in similar companies with more diversified product/service offerings. As for me, I'll look towards safer harbors. Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.
