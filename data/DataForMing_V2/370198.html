How about Hightail-ing it? Brad Gralinghouse | Hightail | rebranding | Silicon Valley | startup | storage | Yahoo | Yousendit Silicon Valley startup YouSendIt, whichÂ began as a file sharing and storage company, is getting a corporate makeover. YouSendItÂ comes off, and HightailÂ gets papered on. Â And that’s not the only change Chief ExecutiveÂ Brad Garlinghouse is making as he competes more directly with larger startups Dropbox and Box. Hightail will now offer unlimited storage forÂ its paying customers, 90 percent of which are corporations and small businesses. GarlinghouseÂ decided to get a jump on competition with the new offerÂ as he feels storageÂ isÂ fast becoming a commodity. Also, the former Yahoo executiveÂ  had seen this game played in the email space year ago whenÂ Google’s gmail robbed Yahoo mail of its momentum —Â by offering far more storage. Hightail is also considering partnering with some of the larger companies — many of which have reached out to him –to expand its reach. Garlinghouse, however, would not name any of them. With 43 million users and $57 million in revenue, theÂ rebrandingÂ better reflects the firm’sÂ expanded suite of products that goes well beyondÂ  just filesharing and storage. said Garlinghouse, who has overseen a 35 percent to 40 percent growth in users since he joinedÂ Hightail just over a year ago. The CEO – who is also the authorÂ of theÂ famousÂ Yahoo memoÂ dubbed The Peanut Butter Manifesto– said he had considered many names before settling on the scrappy “Hightail.” He also consciously avoided going with anything that had the word “box” in it. “The simple view is that there are a lot of noisy competitors like Box, Sync, Share,” he said. “We wanted to be distinctive in the market.” We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion, anecdotes, links and data.
