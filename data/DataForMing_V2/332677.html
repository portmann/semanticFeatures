Why The Market Hates Ford - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha I've been long Ford for a long time and I'm shocked by its performance. Now, the auto market looks as uncertain as it ever has. Ride sharing, autonomous cars, new competitors, and emission standards drive this uncertainty. Throughout my training as a value investor, I've been told repeatedly that in the short-term the market is a voting mechanism but in the long-term a weighing mechanism. I've taken this maxim as gospel. For the past few years as an owner of Ford (NYSE: F ), I've been absolutely flummoxed by as to why the market's opinion has deteriorated following improvements in financial performance. However, I've come to realize that the market simply has no idea how Ford should be valued because of the various factors driving the auto market into flux. Ford's current valuation of about 6x 2016 earnings and somewhere in the ballpark of 11-12x FCF implies that the company has a terrible future ahead. Let's take a look at the main concerns at Ford, and why I think investors should limit their Ford positions. And that conclusion likely isn't far off. Even though the US is about 30 million people larger than it was the last time it peaked (2000), I think its safe to say that the market will peak some time in the next two years. Sensational headlines about borrowers falling behind on car payments are not very telling or indicative of the current auto market. Defaults remain below historic highs, and low interest rates will continue to bolster demand. However, from a profitability perspective, I think we will see a highly promotional 2016. Overall incentive spending was up 16% m/m in January, and dealers across the board are finding it difficult to move cars-though demand for SUVs and light trucks remains robust. Though Ford would love to capitalize on this trend, as SUVs and light trucks tend to carry stronger profit margins, high gas prices over the past several years have created a relative glut of fuel efficient platforms. I suspect Ford and GM (NYSE: GM ) will attempt to shift production to SUVs as much as possible, but it will be difficult for plants that have been equipped for the production of much smaller vehicles to pickup the supply slack. Getting back to factors driving a market peak is the simple fact that much of the pent-up demand built during the financial crisis has likely been satiated. As well, low fuel prices will make the economics of upgrading to a more fuel-efficient vehicle less attractive, likely destroying some demand. Ultimately, with incentive spending accelerating, dealerships stuffed with inventory, and some normalizing of demand, the US auto market is probably near its peak, especially from a profitability perspective. Uber (Private: UBER ) and Lyft (Private: LYFT ) have undeniably changed the near-term landscape of the auto market. While bearish prognosticators believe these car share services will eliminate the need to own cars, the inexpensive transportation may actually cause vehicle miles traveled (VMT) to increase. As a result, we could see an uptake in the replacement rate for cars as a new class of professional drivers puts significant wear and tear into their vehicles. VMT soared in 2015 (above), and I've even noticed some interesting trends with regards to public transit usage. Overall, commuting public transit use seems to be on the rise, likely the result of the millennial urbanization . However, I've noticed a stark decline in weekend bus usage, as pooling with the shared ride services is often cheaper than public transit. Thus, while urbanization sounds like a trend that could curb car ownership (and it may as a percentage of the population), Uber and Lyft are likely to counteract this trend. In addition to ride sharing, self-driving cars represent a great unknown in the future of the auto market and will likely play a role in shaping demographic. Self-driving cars currently require driver intervention, and the timeline for their arrival differs. Some estimate strong adoption within the next 5 years, whereas others think adoption is at least 10 years away. Not only does the variance in timeline predictions add an element of unknown, but also I think the changes in behavior and societal housing formation is also quite unpredictable. People could abandon the urbanization trend (unlikely, in my view), sending the demand for vehicles soaring as travel are no longer seen as a barrier. Regardless, it seems likely that it will be another catalyst for VMT growth. While that sounds positive, there is no clear idea of who the winner will be. Will it be an established OEM like Ford or Honda (NYSE: HMC )? Will Lyft and Uber purchase fleets of self-driving cars, creating pricing destruction as the OEMs fight for share on one or two platforms? This leads to my next pointâ€¦ Google's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) self-driving car is a well-known project, but there is no evidence that Google wants to become an auto OEM. Frankly, I wouldn't want Google to become one either when you compare the ROIC of Internet advertising companies to that of vehicle manufacturers. Still, there's a great possibility that intellectual property will play a significant role in the autonomous auto market. If GM, Honda, Toyota (NYSE: TM ), or Google owns the right IP, it could mean steep licensing fees for other OEMs. As a side note, I do not think it's in anyone's best interest to retain fully exclusive IP, as it could prevent broader market adoption. On top of IP, the elephant in the room is the potential gorilla that's entering shortly. The poor return profile of the industry has not prevented Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) from becoming a candidate for the auto market . Apple CEO Tim Cook continues to hint at the development of car, and frankly, Apple is one of the only companies in the world large enough to greenfield its own auto OEM operation nearing scale. If Apple enters the market, it will no doubt grab some market share, though I imagine the company will focus on a niche luxury product offering. Electric cars present a serious threat to the traditional auto OEMs at $4 gasoline, but I think the threat is much less present with the prevailing price environment. Consumers have shown an inability to think long-term, as they tend to demand more SUVs when gas prices are low, and switch to small cars when prices are high. Ford intends on adding four new SUVs to its fleet, but by the time the products reach market, gasoline might be higher driving weaker demand. Thus, there is a change Ford completely whiffs on its new product decision, and consumers want to drive electric cars. Yet another wrinkle into the competitive outlook is the change in emissions standards. Near parabolic increases in miles per gallon will cost OEMs billions in R&D, depressing ROICs. Ultimately, it is difficult for me to find fault with Ford's valuation. Shares are not expensive by traditional earnings metrics, but I think the future of the auto market is unclear and hard to predict. With its high dividend yield, and cheap valuation, I think Ford makes sense as a smaller investment position, betting that the auto market looks a lot like it does today in the next decade.
