Disney Consumer Product And Interactive Segments To Merge - I Was Onto Something - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Disney interactive games do not sell well. The games tend to have mediocre scores. The Interactive segment barely adds to the bottom line. News broke of the merger between Disney's (NYSE: DIS ) Consumer Products and Interactive segment Monday. This was right before I was able to get this article published. You know, that heart-wrenching pending status. "Will they, won't they accept me?" As you can imagine, those awesome Seeking Alpha editors sent me right back to the drawing board for a good reason*. I read the press release and I was stunned that my criticism of this segment included some of the reasons for the merger. I took a look at the annual reports and got to understand a bit more about the Consumer Product segment. (*Editor's note: This is a true story. While the author's original article was in the submission queue, news broke of the merger.) Before I get to that, let me tell you what I was originally thinking. Initially, I believed that the Interactive division was terrible. In fact, I stated that Disney would be better off if it got rid of the Interactive segment all together. Disney has been doing well so far this year thanks to its movies. However, I strongly felt that its gaming division, Disney Interactive, has not been responsible for the run. For the past six years , beginning with 2014, the segment had revenues of 1299, 1064, 845, 982, 761, and 712 million, respectively. Seems good, right? Unfortunately, the net income tells a different story. The only reason for the profitability of this segment in 2014 was due to the Disney Infinity game, which was Disney's knock off of Activision's Skylander series. Getting rid of this division would lower the company's revenues; however, net income would be much higher than reported in the 10-Ks. According to Metacritic's 5th annual game publisher rankings , Disney Interactive is not in the top 15 at all. It is nowhere on the list. The studio receives an average aggregate score of 64 points out of 100. If you take a look at the score distribution, an overwhelming majority of the score is mixed. Normally, a gaming studio that consistently puts out mediocre titles and/or does not consistently generate profits does not survive in this industry. Does Atari ring a bell? Most, if not all the games, are aimed at little kids. The majority of the gaming population is around 30 years of age. Instead of focusing on a target audience, the Interactive segment should create games that are fun for both kids and adults. Think of Nintendo's Mario and Ubisoft's Rayman. These games have wide appeal. Disney has this concept down with its movie division but has yet to nail it down in its gaming division. If you look closely at each of the individual titles released, most of them are in the high 80s low 90s range. This is in stark contrast to the gaming division. I know some of you might be saying, well what about some of their other hits like Kingdom Hearts. Well, that was a collaboration with Square Enix, the creator of the multi-million selling Final Fantasy series. It is one of the very few outliers in Disney's list of flops. In the gaming community, most are well aware that games based off movies are unable to capture that same feeling and is just an opportunity to cash in on the franchise. I look at a few of Disney's movie tie-in games to illustrate this point. An uninspired movie tie in. You may like the game if you are a huge fan of the movie. Gameplay and graphics are forgettable at best. You can read more on the rest of the site , but I think you are starting to understand where I am coming from. It is very difficult to capture the same magic of the movies into video games. They are two different mediums. Activision (NASDAQ: ATVI ) was able to do it once with its Spiderman the movie game back in 2002 . It is rare. I thought if Disney could somehow bridge the gap between these two mediums, the Interactive segment would be viable, otherwise, I don't see the need for it at all. Now that you know how I felt about the Interactive Segment, I can tell you why I feel this merger might be a step in the right direction and is probably a much better strategy than scrapping the Interactive segment all together as I initially thought. Although the Interactive segment was producing losses, the Consumer Products division during the same time frame was producing profits. Net income beginning in 2014 to 2009 was 1356, 1112, 937 816, 677, 609 million respectively. Though it is the 4th highest segment in terms of revenue behind Disney's Studio Entertainment division, the Consumer products division is the 3rd highest income generator beating out that division. This is worth noting as this division, at first glance, does not appear to add much value compared to the Entertainment section. But, I really believe this merger had more to do with the success of the Disney Infinity Series as previously stated. Currently, there appears to be a trend with attaching figurines to video games to create that new experience. Nintendo jumped on this bandwagon with its Amiibo . Normally, that company creates trends instead of following them. Time will tell how this merger works out, but due to the profitability of the Consumer Products division, this could be the beginning of refined and focused gaming offerings.
