TSMC Set To Oust Samsung For Future Apple Chip Fabrication - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (NYSE:TSM) | Seeking Alpha Sep. 28, 2015  1:42 PM ET  |  About: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (TSM) , Includes: AAPL , INTC , SSNLF by: Mark Hibben Data from iPhone 6s and 6s Plus teardowns indicates that TSMC is fabricating Apple's custom processors for the 6s Plus. TSMC only started the production ramp for its 16 nm FinFET process in July. Despite a late start in TSMC's 16 nm FinFET process, TSMC (NYSE: TSM ) appears to have captured up to a third of chip production for Apple's latest iPhones. TSMC is only the second ARM foundry to put FinFETs into production after Samsung (OTC: SSNLF ). TSMC's impressive accomplishment paves the way for it to replace Samsung. The combined resources of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and TSMC could bring about the next process node, 10 nm, as much as a year ahead of Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ). Despite the bad blood between Apple and Samsung, Samsung has been making the A9 systems on chip (SOC) for the new iPhone 6s. Apple had no choice but to turn to Samsung since it wanted to use Samsung's 14 nm FinFET process, the most advanced available from an ARM foundry. Samsung has been in production on the new process since early in the year in order to support the launch of its own Galaxy S6 smartphone in March. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing was racing to get its own comparable 16 nm FinFET process into production, but only started the production ramp in July. Based on the late start of TSMC, I had assumed that TSMC would not be in iPhone 6s/6s Plus when the phones were ready to launch in September. Despite what I called a "strengthening partnership," I argued that TSMC's production ramp was just cutting it too close to make it into the iPhone 6s launch. TSMC-made SOCs would appear in iPhone 6s in Q4. Now that the new iPhones have started to be delivered, it appears I was wrong about TSMC. Based on teardowns by iFixit of the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus , it appears that TSMC is making the A9 SOC for the 6s Plus while Samsung is making the A9 SOC for the 6s. Sales of the 6s Plus could be about one-third of total 6s/6s Plus sales, so this is a huge win for TSMC and something of a minor miracle. How do I know which parts are which? Briefly, it has to do with the part numbering scheme that Samsung and TSMC use. In the table below I summarize the part numbers. It has been well known that Samsung made the original A7 SOC for the iPhone 5s . Likewise, it's also well known that TSMC made the A8 SOC that went into both the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus . To ramp up production of a new process from a more or less standing start into volumes sufficient to support an iPhone launch is extremely impressive. It shows how badly TSMC wanted Apple's business and it also shows how badly Apple wants to divorce itself from Samsung. Apple was taking something of a chance on TSMC. Even though Apple probably had Samsung make some extra A9s for the 6s Plus just for backup, 6s Plus availability would have been very tight if TSMC hadn't come through. Early benchmark results appear to confirm most of the performance increase Apple promised for the A9 during the September 9 event of 70% CPU increase and 90% GPU increase. Also, it doesn't appear that there's any significant speed difference between the 6s and 6s Plus versions, indicating that TSMC's chips are equivalent and interchangeable with Samsung. The speed improvements tend to substantiate the assumption that the 14-16 nm FinFET processes are being used, even though the chips themselves have not been inspected yet. This is because the new iPhones use slightly smaller batteries despite the speed improvements. PC Magazine also has compared benchmark results for the iPhone 6s with the Samsung Galaxy S6 and the Galaxy Note 5. In most of the tests, the new iPhone's came out substantially faster in both CPU and GPU performance. This indicates that Apple's custom SOCs maintain a significant lead over Samsung for equivalent manufacturing processes. Whether this lead will translate into significant market share gains for Apple remains to be seen. I believe that they will when combined with the other new features and improvements of the iPhone 6s such as 3D Touch, iOS 9 and the improved front and rear cameras. But the important takeaway is that both Samsung and Apple, as practitioners of custom SOC design, are completely dominant compared to everyone else. TSMC's breakneck production ramp, combined with the intense rivalry between Apple and Samsung, make it all but inevitable that TSMC will completely supplant Samsung as a supplier of foundry services by the end of the year. The fact that TSMC's chips are equivalent in performance to Samsung means that Apple in no way suffers competitively by severing its ties with Samsung. TSMC's impressive performance in partnership with Apple lends some credibility to a rumor that recently surfaced that the next generation A10 SOC could be fabricated on a 10 nm process. At TSMC's June quarter earnings telecon , TSMC stated that it was "on track" to start 10 nm process qualification by the end of this year, with volume production by the end of 2016. Based on what TSMC has accomplished, this projection has much more credibility now in my mind. Let's take a step back and look at the big picture. A year ago when I was projecting the imminent arrival of 14 nm FinFET processes in the ARM foundries, I was still being heckled by the Intel supporters who claimed it would never happen. Now that the ARM foundries have ramped up their own FinFET processes, it's apparent that 64 bit ARM SOCs are extremely powerful. In benchmarks Apple's A9 puts to shame any Atom SOC, even the X5 and X7 series that are fabricated on Intel's own 14 nm process. And people have started to notice, as I pointed out earlier this year when the A8X appeared in the iPad Air 2, that Apple's SOCs are starting to surpass even Intel's Core M series. Now the Apple/TSMC partnership is poised to jump out in front of Intel on 10 nm. While Intel takes an extra tock and pushes off 10 nm to late 2017 , that partnership could have its own 10 nm process in production as much as a year ahead of Intel. Chances are, Samsung will be in this race as well with their own 10 nm process. Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
