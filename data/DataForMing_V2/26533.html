Driving instructor killed in Disney World race car crash | Reuters ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) - A passenger killed in a crash at a Walt Disney World Speedway race-car attraction has been identified as an instructor who was riding in a Lamborghini that hit a guardrail after the driver lost control, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. The instructor was 36-year-old Gary Terry, a senior operations manager at Exotic Driving Experience, the highway patrol said. Terry, who lived in Davenport a few miles south-west of Orlando, died at the scene on Sunday. The driver, Tavon Watson, 24, of Kissimmee, who was taking the ride as a 24th birthday treat, suffered only minor injuries. The estimated speed of the crash was 100 mph (160 kph), according to the highway patrol. The Exotic Driving Experience attraction is offered by North Carolina-based Petty Holdings, which markets products licensed under the name of retired NASCAR stock car racer Richard Petty. No racing experience is required to drive one of the exotic cars, which also include Ferraris, Audis, Nissans and Porsches, according to the attraction's website. Maximum speeds vary depending on the driver's experience, location and other factors. A professional driving instructor provides coaching and feedback from the passenger seat, according to the website. â€œThere are no pedals or steering wheel (on the instructorâ€™s side of the car),â€? said spokeswoman Lauren Swoboda. â€œThereâ€™s a throttle control.â€? The FHP reported both men were wearing lap and seat belts, as well as helmets, in the Super Leggera Lamborghini. "Yesterday we lost a long-time, valued team member of the Exotic Driving Experience family," the company said in a statement on Monday. "Our thoughts and prayers are with Garyâ€™s family and friends. He will be sorely missed," it added. The company also announced the attraction would remain closed Monday and Tuesday. Unrelated to the fatal accident, the Driving Experience, which opened in January 2012Â at the Walt Disney World Speedway, is scheduled to close on Aug. 9.
