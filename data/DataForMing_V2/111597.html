Apple Watch Is Not The End Of Movado - Movado Group, Inc. (NYSE:MOV) | Seeking Alpha Movado has traded down significantly on concerns over Apple Watch sales. But recent data suggests Apple Watch isn't selling particularly well. Watchmaker Movado (NYSE: MOV ) has had a rough couple of years. After the stock hit its peak in the high $40s it bounced around violently before an enormous gap from $39 to $27 that has yet to be filled. The company has fallen victim to the dreaded Apple Watch trade that virtually anyone that touches watches as part of its business has experienced in the last couple of quarters and with each rally firmly rebuffed, Movado has been left for dead. In light of its dreadful price action of late I'll take a shot at valuing MOV to see if it is worth sniffing around for value investors. To do this I'll use a DCF-type model you can read more about here . The model uses several inputs including earnings estimates, which I've borrowed from Yahoo! , dividends, which I've set to grow at 10% annually, and a discount rate, which I've set at the 5 year Treasury rate plus a risk premium of 7%. We can see we're off to a good start here as the model thinks MOV is worth almost $38 per share. That would represent a large rally indeed from the present $26 so let's take a look at the fundamentals and see what they have to say. Movado reported Q1 back in May and the results were actually decent. Revenue was flat but in the current environment for anything and everything related to luxury consumer goods, flat is the new up. Movado's quarter was a positive for me although the stock initially sold off. I thought the results themselves and guidance provided by management were fairly upbeat. Of course, margins are a concern as luxury goods providers of all types have struggled with pricing amid weak demand and Movado was no exception. Gross margins fell more than 200 bps during the quarter and that is an obvious source of concern. The reason is because last time MOV saw a huge downturn in its business its operating margins went decidedly negative and resulted in huge losses. The way I like to look at operating margins is to compare gross margins and SG&A costs as I've done below for the past decade. We can see that some cracks in the armor began to appear for Movado in 2006 and 2007 as the spread between these two numbers began to fall. Of course the recession exacerbated the decline as demand for luxury goods virtually disappeared but since that time we can see MOV came out the other side with stronger margins than ever. In fact, last year was higher than the previous year so MOV's strength is continuing. This will be paramount in 2015 if MOV is to reverse the declines it has seen in its stock because revenue growth is going to be hard to come by. The good news is that analysts are forecasting flat margins for this year. Revenue and EPS growth expectations are nearly identical so analysts have conceded that MOV's margins aren't going to grow this year. That gives MOV some time to figure out how to squeeze some margin from its model and for it to weather the storm from Apple Watch . Speaking of Apple Watch, much of the recent decline in the watchmakers has been attributed to Apple Watch taking over the timepiece landscape but I have never quite understood this argument. I concede the Apple Watch is popular but I don't see MOV competing with it and vice versa. The Apple Watch is a gadget whereas Movado produces fashion accessories. They are not the same product and I don't believe they have the same customer base. And given that Apple Watch's sales appear to be waning significantly, perhaps the threat was overblown in the first place. Either way, I don't think it should be a reason for MOV to selloff when its business is otherwise exhibiting decent fundamentals. With Apple Watch's impact less than expected and otherwise decent fundamentals in place, I think Movado is in good shape going forward. And with it trading for only 11 times forward earnings it has a cheap valuation as well. The market has been too pessimistic on MOV based on Apple Watch and that has created an opportunity for longs. I'm not saying MOV is going to reclaim its highs anytime soon but we should see it back into the $30s as the reality sets in that Apple Watch is not the end of all other watchmakers.
