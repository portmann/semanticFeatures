Apple Bonds: Heavy Trading Volume Is A Concern But Default Risk Remains Low - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha On September 2, Apple was the fifth most heavily traded issuer of fixed-rate senior debt in the U.S. corporate bond market. One of the firm's bond issues had the highest trading volume of any individual bond issue on the day. Two of the 10 heaviest traded bonds were Apple bonds. Default risk is still low and has been stable for the last six months, but the 3-year trend is upward. On October 31, 1997, cumulative default risk was 21.66%. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) ranks number 1 on the Forbes "most valuable brand" rankings . We last reviewed Apple on May 7, 2015, in the wake of its 30-year bond issue and on March 4, 2015 . While Apple has long been one of the best design and marketing organizations in the world, it seeks new products to sell more aggressively than almost any other firm. Lately, the product that has attracted the most press has been the bonds of Apple itself . In this update, we focus on bond trading volume and default probabilities of the firm. In a follow-on piece, we analyze where Apple bonds rank by our best value criterion, the ratio of credit spread to default probability. Maximizing the ratio of credit spread to matched-maturity default probabilities requires that default probabilities be available at a wide range of maturities. The graph below shows the current default probabilities for Apple (blue line) ranging from one month to 10 years on an annualized basis. We plot the current default probabilities versus the default probabilities for AAPL at the time of our previous study, March 3, 2015 (yellow line). For maturities longer than ten years, we assume that the ten-year default probability is a good estimate of default risk. The default probabilities range from 0.01% at one month to 0.01% at one year and 0.21% at ten years. The default probability term structure has twisted slightly since March 3, 2015. We also explain the source and methodology for the default probabilities in each Instablog posted by Kamakura Corporation on Seeking Alpha. There is a 0.01% probability that Apple will default in the next twelve months. The probability of a default over the next decade, however, is 2.07%. To those who might not believe this is a possibility, we remind our readers of this cumulative default probability profile for Apple on October 31, 1997: 21.66%. This is a heart-stopping level of default risk. Looking at the last decade, Apple's 10-year annualized default probability has been trending upward for the last 3 years, in part due to the heavy bond issuance that the firm has undertaken. The National Association of Securities Dealers launched the TRACE ( Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine ) in July 2002 in order to increase price transparency in the U.S. corporate debt market. The system captures information on secondary market transactions in publicly-traded securities (investment grade, high yield and convertible corporate debt) representing all over-the-counter market activity in these bonds. The total of all fixed-rate senior non-call debt issued by Apple and traded on September 2, 2015, is reported here. Apple was the fifth most heavily traded bond issuer in the fixed-rate senior corporate debt market in the United States, ranking higher than such too-big-to-fail institutions as JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM ), Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ), GECC (NYSE: GE ), and Citigroup (NYSE: C ). Even more worrisome is this trading volume for individual bond issues. The most heavily traded Apple bond issue ranked first with trading volume of more than $49 million. A second Apple bond issue was the ninth most heavily traded issue on the day, with volumes of more than $28 million. What about the credit default swap market? The good news is that there has not been a single trade in the credit default swap market on Apple since the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation began reporting trade volume weekly in July 2010. As a former treasurer of a large U.S. bank holding company, I always thought about bond issues in the same way I thought about heartbeats. The more that you have done, the fewer you have left. Continuing with the analogy, a lot of bond issues in a short time, just like heartbeats, can't go on forever. Apple has done a ton of bond financing in a short period of time, and the bonds are definitely not being locked away as a precious treasure, like the rare bond issues by Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM ). While Apple default probabilities remain low, the high level of secondary market trading activity is a worrisome sign, especially when one looks at the credit quality of the top 20 issuers on the trading volume list.
