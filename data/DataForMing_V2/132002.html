Verizon: I'll Buy 10 Out Of 10 Times At This Price - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha Verizon is trading near its floor of support at $46. The company has a good risk/reward profile and has no exposure to 2 biggest headwinds in the market, China and the strong US dollar. Sometimes patience is all an investor needs to make money. When an investor targets a stock and sets a buy-in price where they hope to pull the trigger, it can be tempting to bend the rules when the stock begins to get within 5% of that range. Often times, patience can led to investors missing out on short-term spikes in stock price, but every once in a while it pays off tremendously. One stock I've been tracking that tends to trade within a tight trading range is Verizon (NYSE: VZ ). Over the past 2 Â½ years, Verizon has traded between $45.50 and $52. Whenever a stock trades in a tight trading range like this, investors need the patience to hold off on buying until the stock nears the low end of this range. In the case of Verizon, the stock has a strong floor of support between the $45.50 and $46/share level. This gives investors an attractive entry point with minimal downside risk. With a beta of just 0.33, Verizon will never be a homerun pick, but it offers 10% upside over a relatively short time period and gives investors a 4.78% yield while they wait. Verizon has such a strong support level when it reaches $45-$46 due to the consistency of revenues, cash flow and increasingly attractive dividend yield. Verizon is one of the safest high yielding dividend stocks in the market, which has paid a dividend since 1992 and has logged 8 consecutive years of dividend growth. Over the past twelve months the company has generated operating cash flow of $34.7 billion and free cash flow of $17.9 billion. With $8.5 billion being paid out to shareholders through dividends over the past year, it gives the dividend to free cash flow ratio a very reasonable 47.5%. When you compare Verizon's cash flow and dividend payout ratios to its largest competitor, AT&T (NYSE: T ), Verizon holds up extremely well. While AT&T can claim 30 years of consecutive dividend increases and has a higher dividend yield at 5.4%, Verizon's cash flow better supports the dividend payout. Over the past 12 months, AT&T has operating cash flow of $30.3 billion and free cash flow of $12.5 billion. With $9.6 billion being paid out in dividends over the past 12 months, AT&T's dividend to free cash flow ratio comes to 77%. While I don't believe either dividend payout is in jeopardy, Verizon has far more wiggle room to support its dividend during a downturn. Many investors get caught up in the company's payout ratio (dividend/earnings) to get a feel for a company's ability to sustain and increase its dividend, but the company's dividend to free cash flow is a far more accurate view of the health of the dividend. This metric can't be finagled through accounting tricks like EPS and represents what's left after the company pays all its bills and reinvests in itself. For AT&T and Verizon, cash flow is particularly important to pay attention to because of their large debt loads. To build out nationwide 4G networks and keep them operating smoothly requires significant investments. Both AT&T and Verizon have over $100 billion in long-term debt. Last year, Verizon spent nearly $5 billion in interest payments alone. In order to cover these payments and pay down debt requires significant cash flow that can't get bogged down with dividend payments. Because Verizon can cover its dividend with less than 50% of free cash flow is a big advantage for the company. Over the past 12 months, after paying $16.8 billion in cap ex and $8.5 billion in dividends, Verizon had $9.4 billion left over for acquisitions, share buybacks and flexibility to manage its debt load. Multinationals from Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ ) to 3M (NYSE: MMM ) have been facing strong headwinds from the strengthening US dollar and as a result are seeing declining revenues and shrinking margins. This in turn has led to major multinational stocks declining over the past several months. Over the past couple weeks a new wrinkle has entered the minds of investors and resulted in the broader market facing increased volatility. Growth in China has slowed and any stock with exposure has taken a major hit. This is where investors can get themselves into trouble. No one can predict where China's economy will be in 6 months or whether the Fed will raise rates in September or wait until 2016. If China slows, the market will face continued downward pressure and if the Fed does raise rates in 2015, it will lead to the Euro/USD approaching parity. If this happens major multinationals will face a double hit and will result in sell-off. Luckily for Verizon, the company has neither exposure to China or will be significantly impacted by the strengthening dollar. This along with a floor of support in the stock gives investors a number of reasons to consider $45.50 to $46 an attractive entry point. The stock market can make even the smartest and most prudent investors look foolish, so sometimes the best thing to do is take the complexity out of the market and limit the number of macro issues a specific company faces. There's no stock in the market that doesn't have its fair share of risk. Verizon is in a fiercely competitive industry, which requires intensive capital investments to stay competitive. As a result, Verizon's debt load needs to be monitored. With interest rates at historic lows, debt burden has been put on the back-burner by many analysts. Once rates begin to rise, these debt loads will be under scrutiny. In the case of Verizon, it's somewhat worrisome because the company will find it increasingly expensive to take on new debt to pay for some of its investments and acquisitions. Paying close to $5 billion in annual interest expenses sounds absurd, but Verizon has consistent enough revenue and cash flow to be able to afford this burden. However, as interest rates rise, more and more of the company's cash flow will need to be dedicated to paying down interest. I believe this risk is acceptable because of the tremendous free cash flow they generate and the low dividend to free cash flow ratio. Because of this, I believe Verizon has a more sustainable balance sheet and dividend than many of its competitors, including AT&T. Rapidly declining commodity prices, a Fed meeting and earnings reports will result in continued market volatility in the coming week. Investors interested in investing in Verizon should closely watch the stock to see if it breaks below the $46/share level. In the $45-$46 area, I like Verizon as a short-term (less than 1 year) investment to capture a 10% gain while receiving a 4.8% yield. It's not a homerun pick, but it offers decent downside protection and an attractive risk/reward profile. As long as the stock continues its track record of trading within this tight range, the stock should soon reach the $50-$51 area and give investors the 10% they were looking for in this pick.
