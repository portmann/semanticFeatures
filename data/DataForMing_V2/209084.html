Insight Into Intel SoFIA And Intel Atom - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha SoFIA SoCs are very competitive from a performance and integration point of view. Contra revenue could be an additional compelling point in SoFIA offer. Cherry Trail is only a mid offer among the entire Atom SoCs. The high-end offer will come with Broxton and Goldmont. 14nm switch will come for SoFIA in a low-end offer and mid-end offer, providing a great technology advantage vs. competitors' SoCs at 28nm. Producers started to release 3G SoFIA SoCs powered devices in summer, and they will release further devices with Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) LTE SoCs in H1 2016. These processors do not provide massive performances. On the other hand, they are projected to penetrate the low-end and cheap tablet/smartphone market. Intel's target is to acquire some market share from the lower-end segment of the emerging markets. The company wants also to provide a more complete offer during 2016. The peculiar aspect is that Intel is closing the gap with competitors, and when you better analyze Intel's roadmap, you can find out that it is building up a good offer. Intel has released Atom x3-C3130 and Atom x3-C3230RK (the only one made by Rockchip) on the market. These SoCs are built with a 28nm node, they use a Mali T400MP2/450MP4 and they finally integrate a long series of welcomed features: 3G/HSPA+, CNV, PMU, Audio, GPS, Bluetooth & Wi-Fi. This kind of integration is what Intel has always lacked in the low-end and mid-end segment of smartphone market. Obviously, the used technology node is quite old, but the target that Intel is aiming for is not different from competitors: Qualcomm Inc.'s (NASDAQ: QCOM ) Snapdragon 210-212 and Mediatek MT6582M use a 28nm node, and even if Snapdragons have an LTE modem inside, these SoCs are quite slower than the Atom x3-C3230RK. The Atom scores around 25000 points in Antutu while the Mediatek and Snapdragon score around 15000-18000 points. For that kind of offer, I think that SoFIA is quite compelling from the integration and speed point of view. Atom x3-C3440 and Atom x3-C3445 are the next SoCs that Intel is going to release. They use the same 28nm node, but they are powered by Airmont CPU cores with higher frequencies; they integrate a Mali T720MP2 and an LTE modem. Such an SoC would likely target products like Mediatek MT6732, MT6735 and Snapdragon 410-412 that will have similar features, LTE modem included. These SoCs generally score between 20000-30000 points in Antutu: given that C3440 and C3445 have better graphics, CPU architecture and clock compared to the previous x3 SoCs, we can expect performances between 35000-40000 points, a result that would make these SoFIAs quite compelling; moreover, when these solutions are targeting sub $150 devices. We all know that Intel has used contra revenue to push tablet SoCs sales. There is some discussion about the contra revenue cut related to the plunge in tablet SoC sales. We must recall that Intel and producers are pushing Core M and x5/x7 in all-in-one laptops, which are greatly eroding pure tablet revenues. Therefore, the tablet sales plunge is not worrying in my opinion, and it does not mean that the Atom SoCs are not competitive at all. In any case, I do not want to focus on that aspect, but I want to recall a recent news which talks about possible (and likely) contra revenue for x3 SoFIA SoCs. Intel is believed to bestow contra revenue of about $3 per x3 SoC, to quicken the new SoC adoption. Such behavior would be suitable to heavily enter the smartphone and tablet market from the low-end entry point. It would be compatible with contra revenue lowering target also. Given that SoFIA is targeting a market where it is possible to obtain an ARM v8a SoC (not fully integrated) at nearly $5 , such a strategy could be aggressive, compelling and effective for producers. The biggest doubt about Intel's strategy is if it will be able to enter the smartphone market, since its actual presence is nearly around 0 (aside from Asus ZenFone 2 offer). It looks like Intel's contra revenue and full-SoC integration are sufficient to attract various producers from the emerging markets. Chinese market aside, Intel is attracting producers/retailers even from other countries such as Philippines (Cherry Mobile, Ekotek), Indonesia (ADVAN) and India. In addition, further products will be released with the 3G and LTE x3, which are the most alluring SoCs of the first SoFIA generation. The SoFIA offer will switch directly to the 14nm node in mid-2016, providing a very consistent performance and efficiency boost compared to the actual 28nm offer. The jump from 28nm to 14nm would roughly reduce power consumption by 60-70% or boost performance by 40-50%, without touching at all the architecture. In addition, Mediatek and Qualcomm solutions for the low-end market (even the mid-end) are still projected with a 28nm node in 2016, leaving a good entry point for Intel. Intel's roadmap showed that the SoFIA offer would have split into two 14nm routes in 2016: the SoFIA LTE 2 for the low end-market (which would substitute the first generation), and the SoFIA MID for the mid-end market. Such a move will likely attract more customers even from the mid-end market, since actual x5 and x7 do not provide the full integration that SoFIA MID would do. This will be interesting, really. The Goldmont architecture will be the Airmont successor, which actually powers Atom x3-C3440, Atom x3-C3445, x5 and x7, while Silvermont will be relegated to the ultra low-end offer. The Goldmont architecture is a new one, and it will provide a consistently better performance than the Airmont core (which was only a tick switch). If you take a look at the previous two slides/images, you can see that the actual Cherry Trail offer (x5 and x7) is stated as a tablet mid-end platform compared to Broxton/Morganfield (Goldmont architecture) which is stated as a performance platform for both tablets and smartphones. 22500 points in 3DMark 1.2 Unlimited overall 36.5 fps in GFXBench T-Rex 1080p off-screen 17.64 fps in GFXBench Manhattan 1080p off-screen These results are very good for a 2W mid-end SoC, and they make a good base for an interesting Broxton/Morganfield solution. If you take a look at the following table, you will see that the actual Intel mid-offer is competitive against the upcoming competitors: Take the Snapdragon 620 as an example. It is a dual quad-core with an A72 big cluster and an A53 little cluster. Based on preview infos, this SoC scores 4000+ points at Geekbench (faster than Z8700 by 14%) but it is slower in GFXBench scoring 31,2 fps in T-Rex off-screen (slower by 15%) and 13 fps in Manhattan off-screen (slower by 26%). I have some doubts about these performances since the SD620 is still a 28nm SoC: it is very likely that the development board of SD620 had no kind of power constrain, making this performance too optimistic. In any case, Intel x7, which uses an old architecture, has comparable scores to the upcoming SoCs that will be released next year: it is quite remarkable. It must be recalled that the Helio P10 and SD620 have additional features: LTE modem for Helio P10 and Wi-Fi, BT, GPS and LTE modules for the SD620. The lack of this is an obvious drawback for the Atom solution, but Intel is going to release the SoFIA MID offer next year, while x5 and x7 are 2015 solutions and they have a very low SDP/TDP. SD620 and P10 TDPs are unknown, but they are probably set around 3W, given the SD6xx specifications. You all know what 3DXP is and how it will be a disruptive technology in the following years. But what does it do with SoFIA and Atom SoCs? Well, 3DXP memory is a very fast one that could be used in fully integrated SoCs to obtain massive performances and maximum miniaturization, probably an unattainable product for competitors for some years. At the moment, 3DXP is centered on cost effectiveness for SSDs and large memory configurations, but in 2017, it will arrive an EM Generation 1 technology that will be performance-focused. That kind of product could be suitable for a full SoC integration, and it would open the door to something very interesting in 2017. 3DXP would be a real trump card for Intel, given that it is not willing to concede licenses about it. In any case, we will have to wait two years at least to see what will happen in the mobile field with these memories. With a better view of what Intel is doing, I think it is possible to understand that the Atom series is more promising than what it was in the past. SoFIA offer looks to be very competitive, and the contra revenue will be a very big help without being too much of a cash burden to Intel. In addition, SoFIA offer will get bigger in 2016 with the low-end second generation at 14nm and a new mid-end offer always at 14nm. Broxton will come in mid-2016 providing a real performance solution which is still missing (remember that x5 and x7 are stated to be mid class compared to Broxton). Given the early adoption of SoFIA SoCs and the upcoming products within mid-2016, Intel is set to aggressively enter the tablet and smartphone market from the bottom, moreover in the emerging markets. The introduction of a mid SoFIA offer would likely erode some market share from the mid-end market, providing good chances of success. As for the mid/high-end and high-end market, there is no necessity for full SoC integration as shown by Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (OTC: SSNLF ) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) with their personal SoCs: having separated Wi-Fi, BT, RF and audio modules, it softens heat generation and it provides better cooling and power efficiency for the central SoC. This arrangement gives very good results with high power SoCs, even with the trade off of higher costs and lower motherboard efficiency and space. In this scenario, I expect that Intel will obtain good results with the SoFIA platform, while Broxton may be the first Intel SoC able to get attention in the high performance field. If Intel will be able to penetrate the mobile market, even starting from the low/mid-end devices, the mobile scenario could radically change and Intel would become quite problematic for competitors. If you also consider its potential with technologies like 3D Xpoint, Intel is quite "dangerous" for Qualcomm. Intel is probably a very good bet on the long run, even without a rosy future in smartphone market. But things may be already changing for better in that field.
