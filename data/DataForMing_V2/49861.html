Jim Craddock will open with an overview of our first quarter 2015 performance followed by John Clayton who will cover our operating results. Jim will provide closing comments and then open the lines for Q&A. During Q&A, we ask that participants limit themselves to one primary question and one follow-up. Let me now turn the call over to Jim. James E. Craddock - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Toni. Good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining us this morning. First quarter of 2015 has quickly come to a close and we're very pleased with our start to the year. Now that we have four months into the year, we are focused more than ever on executing our plans to maximize shareholder value. We remain committed to a program that does not outspend the cash flow we expect to generate or require us to take on additional debt. Now let's review our key first quarter accomplishments. We delivered strong production volumes averaging 66,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 21% versus the prior year. We came in at the higher end of the 64,000 Boe per day to 67,000 Boe per day guidance range, we provided last quarter. Competitive results in both of our operating areas contributed to our progress. At Gates Ranch, we completed our best well to-date. Gates Ranch 2819 "H" well is currently producing at a rate of 6,400 Boes per day. That equates to an impressive 800 Boe per day per 1,000 foot of lateral. This 8,000 foot extended lateral well was competed with an enhanced 40 stage frac design that our technical teams have been working to perfect. We also successfully drilled three Upper Eagle Ford wells at Gates Ranch as part of our pilot program to further test the potential of the thicker sections of the Upper Eagle Ford. Two of the Upper Eagle Ford wells were drilled in Row 2 of the Ranch. They will be part of testing the use of refrac on the offsetting Lower Eagle Ford producing wells, originally drilled in 2012. John will discuss our opportunities to test the application of refracs later in his remarks. Another exciting accomplishment was in our horizontal development activities in the Delaware Basin. We successfully completed three operated wells and participated in the completion of six partner-operated wells. The 30-day average IP per 1,000 foot of lateral for our three operated Wolfcamp "A" wells averaged 260 Boes per day – outstanding result that compares very favorably to results of other operators active in the basin. The performance of our wells utilizing the improved completion design is evident when compared to the current Wolfcamp "A" type curve. We're very pleased with our progress in delineating the Wolfcamp "A" bench. Our technical teams continue to work on improving the efficiency of all aspects of our operation. As outlined in our earnings release, we are reaffirming our 2015 guidance for capital and production, decreasing DD&A expense guidance. We're still on track to spend $350 million of capital for the year and live within cash flow. On the hedging front, we maintain a discipline hedging strategy and continue to evaluate opportunities to add derivative positions when pricing conditions are acceptable. In 2015, our strong hedge position has been instrumental in protecting our revenue stream. At the end of the quarter, our hedge positions had a mark-to-market value of approximately $272 million as shown on slide 3. Detailed summary of our derivatives position as of April 28 is attached to the earnings press release. Finally, on financing and liquidity: On April 21, our credit facility's borrowing base and elected commitment amount were reaffirmed at $950 million and $800 million, respectively. On May 1, we had no borrowings outstanding with the full $800 million in available capacity plus $20 million of cash, a solid $820 million liquidity position proving excellent flexibility. In summary, we've begun the year delivering some great results on several fronts. Progress we've made on cost efficiencies demonstrates that Rosetta can deliver differential operational performance. We're focused and committed to the disciplined execution of our business and operational plan in 2015. We're closely monitoring the industry environment and our opposition with the flexibility and liquidity to respond to opportunities or adjust activity in a timely and resourceful manner. We look forward to sharing our next update on our Eagle Ford activities and the advancement of our horizontal program in Reeves County, as well as progress on the other growth catalyst opportunities. Now, let me turn the call over to John Clayton for operational comments. John D. Clayton - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President Thanks, Jim, and good morning everyone. Today, I'm going to focus my remarks on the continued success we are seeing in our Delaware Basin Horizontal Wolfcamp program and also some very exciting results we are beginning to see with our new completion designs in Gates South. I will also talk through a few of the catalysts that we are working on in the Eagle Ford, specifically an infill refrac development plan that could positively impact both our lower and upper Eagle Ford plans. And before I turn the call back to Jim, I'll give a few comments on how we see our next quarter, our full year 2015 and also a comment or two on where we are headed in 2016. So, let's get started. Please turn to slide number 4. This is (07:50 – 07:52) of our Reeves County position in the Delaware (07:55 – 07:56) make meaningful progress with our Wolfcamp "A" (07:57 – 07:59) and blue boxes are the operated wells (08:01 – 08:04) are the red boxes are the non-operated wells (08:05 – 08:07) production during the (08:09 – 08:11). I will talk in more detail about the operated wells, however, (08:14 – 08:15) the general areas is turning out to be one of the best areas in the entire Delaware Basin. The Billy Miner 27-9H well (08:24 – 08:25) of the three completions. It is located in the west central portion of the acre. This well was completed with 4,770 foot lateral and we used 22 frac stages. It had a seven-day stabilized production rate of 1,449 Boe per day while the 30-day stabilized rate was slightly over 1,300 (08:44 – 08:45) an outstanding (08:47 – 08:49) per 1,000 foot of lateral. (08:51 – 08:52) completion the Billy Miner 27-2H well and the Black Jack 16-8H well had lateral links of about 4,300 feet, were completed with 17 to 18 frac stages. The Billy Miner well (09:07 – 09:09) position and the Black Jack well is located about five miles to the east of that well. Both wells had 30-day stabilized rates of approximately 1,100 Boes per day, results in a very competitive 254 Boe per 1,000 foot of lateral. Needless to say, we are (09:26 – 09:27) the results of all three of these latest tests. Slide 5 is a chart (09:31 – 09:33). This chart plots the average 30-day rate per 1,000 foot of lateral completed. The population of wells on this chart are our operated Wolfcamp "A" horizontal wells in the Southern Delaware Basin that we have completed with a slick-water frac design. The wells are shown from left to right in chronological order. As you can see across nearly 15 miles of delineation, we are seeing tremendous well performance that is fairly consistent at an average rate of 284 Boe per day per 1,000 foot of lateral. This average compares very favorable to the results being reported by two other operators in the Southern Delaware Basin. On slide number 6, you will see the same completions averaged and then plotted on a rate/cum plot against our published 550 MBo type curve. You can notice that so far, the wells are performing approximately 30% higher than the type curve, something we are very pleased to be seeing. Moving to the Eagle Ford, our technical teams have been working really hard tinkering with the completion (10:35 – 10:38) more effective wet-laid (10:39) rock. In short, we have been attempting to place more proppant at a much tighter cluster spacing. Our latest completion, the Gates Ranch 28-19H well, located in the middle of Row 3 in the southern part of Gates Ranch, was recently completed with 2,100 pounds of sand per lateral foot across 8,000 feet of lateral. On this particular well, we downsized our cluster spacing to only 40 feet, and had five clusters per stage for a stage spacing of 200 feet. This well is currently producing into sales at a rate of 6,413 Boe per day, or roughly 800 Boe per day for 1,000 foot of lateral. So in these depressed commodity cycles, when some companies are cutting costs for cost to stake, I'm very pleased that our technical teams continue to be innovative and are investing in new ideas to further improve what is already a world-class asset. Slide number 7 shows the location of our Upper Eagle Ford wells drilled, both producing and awaiting completion. The well drilled in the northern most area of Gates Ranch is in some of the thickest Upper Eagle Ford section on the Ranch, which is about 275 feet thick. The other two wells that we drilled at Gates are located together in Row 2. As you know, this Row has historically been developed primarily with all lower wells. So these two new upper wells were placed above some existing lower wells in a staggered pattern. With that said, let me explain what we are trying to accomplish with these new upper wells. First, one thing our L&E Upper Eagle Ford pilot has taught us was that the areas that have thicker upper Eagle Ford performed better. In the L&E case, they perform as well as their lower counterparts. Therefore, the Upper Eagle Ford well in the northern most location will be testing some of the thickest Upper Eagle Ford at Gates Ranch. Secondly, we want to determine if it is feasible to frac an Upper Eagle Ford well that lies above two older Lower Eagle Ford wells. To do this, we plan to test the viability of re-fracking the underlying lower wells immediately prior to fracking the upper wells. This technique will apply stress on the lower well reservoirs, which should help divert the upper well completion away from the lower wells and into new reservoir rock. This is very similar to our buffer pad process that we have been using in the Lower Eagle Ford development for the past few years. I would like to make a point about the refrac concept. It is not simply a process to help us obtain more effective upper well stimulation, it is also a method to change the orientation of the frac geometry of the lower wells and either stimulate new lower reservoir rock or more effectively stimulate the existing rock. Other operators have begun testing refracs in the Eagle Ford, and based on some of the data that we have been observing, this application seems to be paying dividends. Some refrac'd wells have even returned to their original IPs and even after six months to nine months of post-refrac production, they seem to be producing a significant amount of incremental reserves. Needless to say, we are excited about testing this on our Eagle Ford asset. Let's now move over Briscoe Ranch where we have also had two wells drilled and awaiting completion in the Upper Eagle Ford. One is a 10,000 foot lateral and one is a 5,000 foot lateral. Completion of the 10,000 foot lateral will provide critical information not only by stimulating the thick 240 foot Upper Eagle Ford section, but it may allow us to drill the remaining inventory at Briscoe Ranch by drilling across the entire width of the Ranch with one 10,000 foot lateral rather than our current plans to drill two 5,000 foot laterals to recover the same resource. As a reminder, Briscoe has some of the thickest total Eagle Ford section in the entire play at approximately 350 feet. My last comment on Upper Eagle Ford, that we continue to monitor the progress of our pilot well at L&E Lease in Central Dimmit County. This pilot has been on production now for more than a year. The cross-section on slide 8 shows that this well was completed in the middle of thicker Upper Eagle Ford section. The updated production graph shows its performance. And as you can see, the upper well remains in line with its Lower Eagle Ford offsets. This well's performance is a very positive indicator for the Upper Eagle Ford wells that we have now drilled in the thick Upper Eagle Ford sections at Briscoe Ranch and Northern Gates Ranch. So we're looking forward to getting those completions underway. Let me finish up with a little guidance. We are reaffirming our 2015 annual guidance of $350 million of capital and a production range of 58,000 Boes to 62,000 Boes per day. When we originally provided this guidance, we stated it would be more weighted in the first quarter and the fourth quarter of the year, from both a capital and production standpoint. These assumptions still hold true today. Therefore, for the second quarter of this year, we are guiding capital to be approximately $55 million, and a production range of 57,000 Boes to 60,000 Boes per day. For your reference, slide 9 outlines our guidance for the second quarter and full year 2015. Looking a little further down the road into 2016, we could deliver approximately 15% production growth over our 2015 levels, by spending about $350 million in total capital. In an extremely low price environment, we could still experience modest 2016 production growth over this year's production levels, at a capital program of about $225 million. At this point, it is obviously too early for me to provide more detail around our 2016 plans and we will revisit this subject with you later this year. But I wanted to at least give you guys some insight as to how efficient we could be with our portfolio in a low price environment. That concludes my operational remarks. And as always, I thank you for your interest in our operations and look forward to updating you on our Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin activities and results on the next call. With that, I'll turn it back to Jim. James E. Craddock - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer Thanks, John. We had a good start to 2015 with some great well results in our Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin assets. We're progressing in both of our core areas. We will continue to work to further improve the efficiency of our operations at South Texas and the Permian Basin. We have quality assets into the premier basins and maintain our competitive capital efficiency, awestrucker (17:27) structure and that's a key part of our ongoing success. Before we open this call for Q&A, as always, I'd like to thank Rosetta's technical and business support teams for their focused approach to accomplishing the job at hand. The team's commitment through these early months of 2015 has been exceptional. And our first question comes from the line of Welles Fitzpatrick with Johnson Rice. Your line is now open. Welles W. Fitzpatrick - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC Can you talk a little bit about the costs on the 28-19H and what that new completion technique might make AFEs look at on a 5,000 foot or, I guess, 7,000 foot's kind of the average goal for going forward? John D. Clayton - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President Yeah. Welles, I'll tell you kind of how we're looking at it. It's very early, but we're not only encouraged by that first well, although it's only been on for a little more than a week now. The second well that's coming up on a week looks pretty good too. The 28-19 – let me back up and start from our type curve. So for us in today's environment, to drill a 5,000 foot well with our old design, which is tied to the type curve, cost about $5 million. So if I use that as a starting point and I did nothing but change the completion design for a 5,000 foot well, it increases my cost to about $6 million. Now, when I ratio that up for an 8,000 foot lateral, which is what this well was, it's about $8 million. So if you're comparing costs to, let's say, type curve performance, it's actually a 60% increase in costs compared to the type curves I think that are in the Toni and Blake's deck. So what we're trying to ascertain on this is if you now look at the production uplift, we are four times – now, it's early – but we are four times the producing rate today on the 28-19 well when compared to the type curve and the expected production that we would have seen off of it. Now, we know the type curve is normalized for 5,000 foot, so you have to ratio that up for longer laterals, and if you compared 8,000-foot of what we're seeing on this well to a type curve ratio to up for 8,000 foot, we're 2.5 times above that. So it's early, but we really like tightening the cluster spacing and pumping more sand. This well had 2,100 pounds of sand per foot and if you kind of go back in time, that's about 2-1/2 or 2-3/4 times the amount of volume of sand we're pumping on these wells. So anyway, 60% more cost for four times the production, I guess is the short answer. Welles W. Fitzpatrick - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC Okay. Perfect. And then for the follow-up, do you guys have an initial kind of guess on a what refrac might cost and could you also use that technique that you described to just down-space within the Lower Eagle Ford back up on rows 1 and 2? John D. Clayton - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President Yes. I didn't talk about it on the call. I'll answer kind of your second comment. We've actually drilled a well on Row 1 in between two of the older wells, but we have a lower well on Row 1 that we drilled in between two of the older 850 foot space lower wells that I think we drilled back in 2012. So we are doing that, I didn't mention it on the call. It's a good project, but I wanted to really emphasize not only the new completion techniques, but the refracs that we're going to try in the Upper. Cost wise, we're trying to understand a little bit about the most effective way to get the fracs on the refracs converted. There's a lot of work being done now on some different products in the industry. We're looking at all of them. But I think a good starting point on cost is you could probably take the cost that it takes to complete a well and use that. You'll save on some of the plugs, but then you'll get a little more expensive on some of the diverting material that we're looking at. So it gets you in a ballpark until we've actually done. You can model just the original completion cost on a new well. Although, we won't be setting plugs and so forth, but the diverter will cost a little bit more. Welles W. Fitzpatrick - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC That's perfect. And thanks so much, guys. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Will Green with Stephens. Your line is now open. I wonder if we could touch on the Southern Delaware. I know when you guys first entered the play, you were looking at first year declines that were pretty high, and I thought slide 6 was great kind of showing how you guys have actually compared versus the type curve, which has been pretty good. So I wonder if you could talk about how you guys are currently feeling about first year declines and EURs there, at least how the type curves for the wells that are performing are shaping up? John D. Clayton - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President Yeah, Will, this is John. We used to have a plot, and it probably is still on our website, where we just plotted rate time against the type curve. And if you look at those declines on that plot, it's probably out on our website, the wells are produced – if you look at some of those declines with the new fracs, which are some that are on that slide with all the bars on it. The decline seem to be a little less than what our type curve declines at. Now, some of these wells are pretty good, now that we've increased – real similar to what we did on the 28-19 well – we're pumping almost three times as much proppant. So it's early, but the declines, I guess today if you ask, we're a little more optimistic about the declines compared to the type curve. But I'd probably reference you may be back to the rate time plot that we did – I bet it's on our website – and then look at the actual decline compared to the type curve. But I think you'll see that the higher rate wells, which is the one we're pumping more sand on seem to have a little flatter first year decline. But it's pretty early and the geography is pretty broad across this area. Great. I'll take a look at that. And then you guys kind of alluded to looking at your two-year outlook, I understand that the goal whenever you guys came out with that two-year outlook was focus on the balance sheet and returns and really protecting liquidity. With the price of crude kind of rallying here and costs coming down, what it sounds like, pretty well on the service side, how are you guys thinking about the threshold of where you guys feel comfortable of adding activity? Is it a balance sheet metric? Is it something on the price of oil? Is it a combination? How should we think about your plans to potentially accelerate, what's going to be the driver behind that? James E. Craddock - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer Well, this is Jim. Good question. The way we think about it, again, I think first and foremost, is live within cash (25:16). We – the improvement in oil prices could give us a little increased flexibility. And John's laid out a number of what we're calling kind of catalyst projects that are in that discretionary spending number that we talked about in the first quarter. So we'll look at that. Now, keep in mind that we're pretty well hedged. And really, as prices improve, the component of our hedging that's associated with swaps, we won't see a big change in the revenue associated with those until we get – oil prices get up quite a bit higher. So my thought is we're probably going to be pretty close to the $350 million we've guided to, the difference – the difference is I think we're going to be able use a little cost savings, a little efficiency to probably get a few more of the discretionary projects done than we were originally thinking three months ago. John D. Clayton - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President Yeah. Well, this is John. What I would add to it is if you look at our capital plans for the year, it's front loaded in 1Q and then it's loaded in 4Q. So if you just set an incremental 5% savings – and I think right now we're in the 22% to 23% savings off of the fourth quarter – but if you took another 5% on the capital in the second half of the year, it wouldn't accelerate a whole lot, but that allow us to spin maybe $7 million to $9 million more and if we were able to realize another 10% we could probably do a couple of more wells. And I think our goal for that is to apply those to discretionary projects, which would be these refracs in Upper Eagle Ford because we learned so much more about our portfolio when we make those types of investments. I know our Permian team is looking at refracing some of the old wells in the Permian basin that were drilled horizontal with old completion techniques just to optimize and see if there's opportunity there. So we kind of look at these downturns as we may not be spending as much capital, but the guys upstairs and girls upstairs that are doing this technical work have got a lot of ideas that I think we would fund with incremental savings to learn more about the portfolio. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Dan McSpirit with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Dan E. McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Thank you and good morning. Previously, you've talked about defending an annual production rate of 60,000 Boe per day maybe in an effort to preserve inventory for better pricing. Why is 60,000 Boe the level to defend and has that view changed at all, when looking at the current strip that lacks much of a contango. James E. Craddock - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer Dan, I think 60,000 Boe is still the number; and simply put, but that's kind of where we think we land with this year's cash flow and living within that cash flow, doing a balanced mix of projects. I mean we could put more capital in the Eagle Ford less into the Permian and juice that production a little bit, but we feel like it's better to kind of follow this balanced approach. And as John mentioned, as we move forward in time and look at 2016, we think we can grow off of that level. And as he said, I mean, if we spend roughly the same amount of capital we're spending this year, next year, we can probably grow to the tune of 15% or so off of the 60,000 we'll be averaging this year. Dan E. McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Okay. Great. And as a follow-up, just turning to the balance sheet with that previous question as the context, where do you see leverage at the end of this year and, again, based on your outlook for – of delivering 15% growth on $350 million in spending next year, where do you see it at year-end 2016? John E. Hagale - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President This is Hagale. And what I'd have to say is if you look at it just as draw on the revolver, what I'd say (29:16 – 29:18) live within cash flow this year and next year, so that ought to tell you that plus or minus a little bit, you'd think you wouldn't be very drawn on the revolver at the end of this year or next year, all other things being equal. And our next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with SunTrust. Your line is now open. Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Hey. Morning, guys. Say, Jim, just a question for you. I guess, looking at – I think for the last quarter mentioned about the three wells drilled in Gates and then you have the six in the Perm. Just your thoughts, I guess, for mainly you were giving the sort of capital that you have allocated, well-wise, I guess, is going to be somewhat similar as far as the direction of where that capital will be allocated? James E. Craddock - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I think, kind of going back to what we said last quarter and then kind of updating, we said for the full year we expected to do about 20 Eagle Ford wells and eight Permian wells, and that's completions. And so far, we've done 14 wells in the Eagle Ford, so we've got another six to do. We've done three in the Permian, another five to do there. And then the only difference would be there is the discretionary component and some of that could look like refracs. So, those don't – we're not counting those as unique new wells, but we think we'll be able to allocate some funds towards refracing as we move through the program that John Clayton took you through. So that's kind of the plan. As John said, we'll probably have a similar activity level in 3Q as we're forecasting in 2Q and then an uptick in activity as we enter the fourth quarter. Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. And then, Jim, why not is it – I guess – is it because of the – I guess just the explorations you're doing and new frac designs you're doing at Gates? I guess, my question would be given the great success you're seeing in the Delaware and it appears that just in today's environment, there's better realizations in Delaware than the sort of gas, your NGLs that's in the Gates Ranch and other parts of your Eagle Ford. Why not flip that and do much more in the Delaware versus the Eagle Ford because of today's realizations? James E. Craddock - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer Neal, we like both areas, and you're right, we're seeing some great results in the Delaware. We have a pretty methodical approach. We're still testing in both those areas frac designs, but while you do see some nice realizations in the Delaware, it's hard to argue with a 6,000 barrel a day Eagle Ford well too. And we're also seeing very nice returns from projects like that. So, we like both areas. We like a balanced approach here, and I think we'll continue to pursue that. Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Rowe with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company. Your line is now open. Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc. Hi, good morning. I just wanted to talk a little bit about your – how are your assets – your base assets are declining. I think you mentioned about a 40% base decline from kind of exit 2014 to exit 2015, previously. And so I just wanted to get a sense for how is this going to look throughout the course of the year, because when you look at kind of Q1 and Q2, and we're seeing volumetric declines of around 10% per quarter, but you're still spending some capital to add new wells. So, can you just maybe talk about how the decline profile of that base changes as you get through later on during the year? John D. Clayton - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President Hey, Michael, this is Clayton. Yeah, I would – I'll go back and kind of mention what you had said. So, we've done a bunch of work at the end of last year on what's the base decline look like. And coming into 2015 and going into 2016, I think those numbers you quoted were how I remember them too, about a 40% decline in the base production. And then, we took that same production and we went out 24 months and then looked at the next year decline, and I believe the number was 19% and those don't change. So we haven't had enough history enough history behind us to make any of those adjustments, and the base seems to be performing pretty well right now. If you look at the decline, we experienced from the end of last year into the first quarter, you have to kind of go back and look at the number of wells that came on in the second half of 2014 as we turned from Row 2 into Row 3 and we brought on just a large amount of wells. And you know when those new wells come on from a well basis, not the base, but just an individual well basis, I think the first year decline is up in the 70% to 80% range. And so that's -those new wells that came on towards the end of last year was the incremental decline that we experienced here. So, that – that's what gives us our 40% as those wells will continue decline into this year and that's what makes this year's base decline so steep. One thing I would point out on production forecast, I think Jim alluded to it both from capital and production. 3Q ought to be very similar to 2Q, not only from spending, but also the production ranges that we've put out there. And then we start ramping up a little, both capital and production as we head into 2016. I will point out – and it's kind of background noise – we had mentioned that our (34:55) asset was a non-core asset. It's a dry gas. We divested of that property in April and I think on a Boe basis. Although it was 100% dry gas, it was producing a little less than 2,000 Boes a day. We didn't adjust our production guidance – kind of background noise. There's decline to that throughout the year, but small divestitures like that, we won't have those going into next year and we didn't adjust our production just because it's not a big, big mover. Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc. Great. No, thanks for going through that. And just switching over to Permian, one quick question, the longer term cumulative production on a equivalence basis is helpful. One thing I was wondering if you could expand upon is how you're seeing oil cut trending since IP? I think the – your type curve has about a 74% oil cut for the EUR, so I just wanted to see if you had any kind of thoughts just on this early data around how those oil cuts are looking relative to your type curve? Thanks. John D. Clayton - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President I don't know if they cut you off, but I'm assuming you're talking about the Permian. If you look at the width of our Permian acreage, it's 20 miles long, so I'm going to talk in pretty broad ranges here. But there is a lower oil cut on probably four sections on our acreage to the far northeast. We have a higher GOR in that area. And then we get into oil cuts in the , I want to say, 75% to 80% range throughout the majority of our acreage. As you move to the west now, so as we move further west, you'll see on the map on slide 4, I think it is, it's titled Permian Basin Reeves County – it's the lease map – where the abstract changes, so where the geometry of the surface lease descriptions (37:03 – 37:07) up quite a bit of higher gas ratios in there. So gas trends higher to the west, but I believe the farthest blue line on our acreage position, I believe that's the Blue Duck well and I believe it had 60% – and I'm going off of my memory – but I think it had 68% oil cut. And when we actually drilled that well, we thought there was a possibility it would have a lower oil cut because as you go west, it gets gassier. And although it's less than our type curve, we were pleased that it was 67%, if my memory serves me right. Anyway, I hope that answers your question. James E. Craddock - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer And just in case, there was another part of your question there, Michael. If you are asking how oil cut changes with these wells over time, we're not seeing any variability really to speak of in oil cut over time. Obviously, all the wells are pretty new, but we see that – that oil cut holding in there pretty well. John D. Clayton - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President I'll add before the next question, I don't know if it was Dan or Neal about capital allocation. In the Permian, we've got some pretty terrific operators that offset us out here that are also trying numerous completion techniques and designs. So it does help us a little bit with how we allocate capital. If we didn't have them in our backyard trying some pretty good technical ideas, we would have to go alone and that would probably cause us to allocate more capital, but when Jim was talking, I thought I would add that color to it. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Gordon Douthat with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Gordon Douthat - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thank you. Good morning everybody. Just on the 2016 scenarios you laid out, I'm wondering if you could provide any detail on the rig count or activity levels from a well count standpoint in the various scenarios you laid out for the next year? John D. Clayton - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President This is John, Gordon. The minimum commitment that we have in Eagle Ford is 10 wells at Gates Ranch and Briscoe Ranch is HGP (39:22). I don't have the exact well counts specifically for the cases our planning group ran. I just pulled those numbers from it in prep for the call, but it's probably a dozen wells in the Eagle Ford, on round numbers, and it's probably about the same activity that we have in the Permian that we have this year, because that eight wells of operated wells this year allows us to hold the leases intact. So it probably goes from 28 wells this year down to maybe 20 wells or so forth next year is the way I... Gordon Douthat - Wells Fargo Securities LLC So those are your – those are the minimum levels you can hold acreage. Is that – at those levels would you be able to grow production at the 15% rate or what kind of growth or what activity levels gets you to those? John D. Clayton - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President Right. So two – those levels were the $225 million total capital level, so for – it wasn't surprising to us, especially with the results that we're getting in South Gates, and we know that South Gates was going to be prolific than North Gates. But when you hold the acreage positions together, it takes about $225 million. And when we turn the crank on that model for 2016, we actually have modest production growth. If you then allocate the same spending level that we did this year, which was $350 million – so let me back up. So the $225 million tied to the – into 12 wells in the Eagle Ford and then about eight wells in the Permian. If you to the $350 million, which is the spending level we have this year, that's the capital level that gets us to about a 15% production growth off of the midpoint of 60,000 barrels a day that we're guiding to for 2015. Gordon Douthat - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Okay, that's helpful. And then I – recognizing the strips somewhat flattens out here, as you look into next year, just trying to get a sense of what levels you'd like – you're looking for to add more hedges? John E. Hagale - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President We're starting to look at them. It curves in a little – this is Hagale – it curves in little bit as oil prices are going up. We have not put any more on. But I'd say, it's starting to look interesting as you go out a little bit. And our next question comes from the line of David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Your line is now open. David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors John, that walked through of the minimum spending and kind of $350 million CapEx is really helpful. One of the things that you mentioned around your discretionary spending being up with the Upper Eagle Ford and refracs, I was trying to think through how that fits into the range of outcomes around just kind of quarterly progression and then exit rate into 2015 into 2016? Like, is there a volume sense that you can give us around just that kind of discretionary spending or is it really more defining resource and defining inventory as the objective? John D. Clayton - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President Hey, David. There'll be volume with it. Right now, we're trying to figure out the best way to get these – not only the upper wells, because we're going to do the refracs at the time – is get those refracs diverted. So we probably won't be – there was about $40 million of discretionary that wasn't allocated and as we look going into the second half of the year, we probably won't start Upper Eagle Ford refracs until the third quarter. So we're not guiding towards an exit rate right now. I'll just tell you the way we've got it modeled is the fourth quarter's going to be a little higher than 2Q and 3Q. Our spending will be up in the fourth quarter too, but we don't know the exact timing of landing on the best completion technique to get that refrac diverted. So we probably won't be starting it until 3Q. So, I hate to be very vague - John D. Clayton - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President ...with an exit rate, but we've kind of stayed away from it because we are kind of trying to do what you said in your other half of your question was we're trying to understand the resource with these investments. And then once we do that on a smaller scale, then we can apply it to a broader scale with a lot more capital in subsequent years. But there will be volume associated with it, and it won't show up as much on the annual as it will on the exit. David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors And then with the carryover capital in the first quarter at higher level, just trying to think about how you kind of allocate capital quarter in, quarter out versus actual wells coming online that allow you to kind of dampen some of that decline and flatten out production is how it looks like things are flowing through. Is that a kind of fair way of thinking about the fourth quarter and first quarter spend rate, versus kind of the glide planning in and around your guidance for second quarter and then full-year production. Is that how it's flowing through your models and just trying to get a better idea of how that's helping the second half of 2015? John D. Clayton - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President Yeah. I think – I'm just sitting here thinking about what you said. I mean, that's kind of how we look at it too. Jim mentioned we did 14 Eagle Ford wells in the first quarter, but I know that we only brought 11 of them on. And then the three wells that we're talking about right here were actually first delivered in the second quarter. So there is a lag - John D. Clayton - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President ... there is a lag on production tied the capital. Sorry. (45:09) James E. Craddock - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer And then if you're talking about carryover capital from Q4 of 2014, I don't have the exact number in front of me, but (45:14 – 45:19) we'll spend, because we had some capital – Q4 capital, maybe $20 million or – it was $20 million or $25 million that was spent in Q1, that was actually for stuff that was done in Q4. David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors Yeah. Okay. So that's kind of, again, giving you that kind of flattening into the summer before you start ramping CapEx again into fourth quarter. Okay. That explains things a little better. This is – that's helpful. Thanks, guys. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Stevens with KeyBanc Your line is now open. Chris S. Stevens - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Hey, guys. Quick question on the new completion design at Gates Ranch, is that the new standard on a go-forward basis in the Eagle Ford? And also what's the average of lateral length of the remaining inventory over Gates Ranch? John D. Clayton - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President Hey, Chris. It's John. Second part of the question I think we're right at about 7,000 feet for the remainder of South Gates. And then in North Gates, I think those average about 5,000 feet. So that's the lateral length question. Briscoe could turn into all 10,000 foot laterals going forward, as could L&E because the width of L&E lease is 10,000 foot as well. We've got a well-planned – so let me talk about the design. So we used to space our stages 325 feet between stages. This last well was 200 foot between stages. So we've tightened up the stages quite a bit. Probably more importantly, on the way I look at it, there's a lot of smart guys working on this smarter than I am upstairs, but we used to put a cluster of perforations every 80 foot. That 28-19 well had the clusters put every 40 foot. That's the lowest or the tightest density of perforations we've put in the well, but I will not – I would not say that's the standard. We have a well coming up, that's also going to pump 2,021 foot or pounds per foot of proppant, but we're spacing the clusters 25 feet apart. So we're still tinkering with it. There seems to be a direct correlation in the amount of proppant that you pump versus well results, but there's kind of a third dimension to it. There seems to be a relationship, at least early on, the tighter you space these clusters, the more effective you're getting the rock simulated. So that 28-19 well was the tightest we've ever spaced at 40 foot, but we've got one coming up that's at 25 foot. Chris S. Stevens - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Okay. Great. And if you could just update us on the recent well costs in the Wolfcamp and where you see the PV-10 breakeven out there today? John D. Clayton - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President Our latest well cost – oh gosh, I don't know what – I don't know what's in our deck out there now, but if you took a section long lateral and you pumped it with the increased proppant density, we're probably in the $7.5 million to $8 million range. They're a little higher than the Eagle Ford. And then the second part of the question, what was it? John D. Clayton - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President I don't have that off the top of my head. The AFEs we're seeing today with the new proppant loading and all are well north of breakeven. So I'm not exactly sure of the breakeven right now, but we may be able to follow up. Blake or Toni can follow up with you on that. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robert Alpaugh with Simmons & Company. Your line is now open. Robert Alpaugh - Simmons & Company International Oh, yeah, just one quick question, you obviously highlighted the opportunities for refracing in the Eagle Ford, I was wondering if the same opportunities exist in the Permian? John D. Clayton - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President I think there's – there'd be two ways to look at the Permian. I think once we take – and we being the industry – once we pull enough hydrocarbons and volume out of the rock, we'll change the stresses. And then we could go back in later on and see if there's a refrac application. So the mechanics of the refrac on changing the orientation of the second frac is what gives us unique reserves. So we have to pull fluids out first. But near-term, a lot of the wells in the Delaware side and the Permian, we've started out being a linear gel type fluid. And then it moved to a slick-water initiated fluid, and then we've got some companies out there that are trying 100% slick-water right now. So we're watching those results. But there is the opportunity, we believe in the near-term, to go into some of the 2013 vintage wells and attempt the refracs to have a more efficient completion technique. But I think if you look at refracs, whether they're in the Barnett, or even some of the earlier ones that are being done in the Eagle Ford, there needs to be a year two of production first in order to get those stresses in the rock changed to go in and reorient that frac. So I think there is opportunity; it's just not on our doorstep today, unless we're going in trying to effectively stimulate the rock better. Thank you. And we have a follow-up question from the line of Dan McSpirit with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Dan E. McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Thank you. If I could just squeeze another one in here, just on the DD&A rate and guidance, your footnote that favorable changes to the rate are anticipated at least with respect to full-year guidance. Any thoughts on where it could go or maybe what commodity price environment the current rate is reflecting? John E. Hagale - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Dan, this is Hagale. What I'd say is, what's in there now reflects the impairment we had in Q1. If prices stay low – and we signaled this both in the K and in the Q – if prices stay low, there will be future impairments and those will impact it. So those will impact the future DD&A rate. So this DD&A rate for Q2 and for the year reflects the impairment charge that we've taken to-date; can't really give you an estimate for the future, because it's going to depend on commodity prices. This is one based on 12-month trailing commodity prices. So you haven't seen the full effect. If prices stay where they are, you're going to see further degradation of that. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Grigel with Macquarie. Your line is now open. Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital ( USA ), Inc. Hi. Thanks. You guys have talked about the potential for discretionary CapEx for a well or two. Will there be any interest in heading to the Permian to maintain leaseholds on some of the lease expirations you guys have previously mentioned or would refrac be the more likely use of spending there? John D. Clayton - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President Yeah. I think if we use some of the discretionary in the Permian, it would probably – it wouldn't be to just drill incremental wells, offsetting wells that we already know, might not preclude us from going into a Bone Spring test or maybe a Wolfcamp 'B' or 'C' test. The team's got a lot of opportunity there, and we haven't allocated any capital towards that in today's environment with the low price. But I think the headline on it is discretionary capital goes to opportunities that we can learn from to open up our understanding of the portfolio and that would lead us to a refrac or maybe a non-Wolfcamp 'A' zone. Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital ( USA ), Inc. Okay. And if it were between a refrac or the Permian, is there a decision already been made on which one of those would be the higher priority? John D. Clayton - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President No, not really. There is a old 2013 well that's out there, the Balmorhea well, and I know that the guys upstairs are itching to refrac that, because they think the rock's got tremendous potential with the increased proppant loading and the slick-water initiated frac, but the decision hadn't been made. Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital ( USA ), Inc. Okay. And then one just quick follow-up and apology if I missed it, on the 15% growth for 2016, under that scenario, is that a fourth quarter to fourth quarter rate or a full year 2016 over full year 2015? Just wanted to make sure I had got that right. John D. Clayton - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Rowe with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company. Your line is now open. Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc. Thanks for letting me squeeze back in here. Just one more quick question, the Eagle Ford, is the larger frac design leading to any more unexpected downtime than you've experienced with your prior ceramic design? John D. Clayton - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President No, it hasn't. We're still using the buffer pad concept, so we still have wells shut in. But now that we're on a steady pace, the downtime is transparent to the production. Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc. Okay. And to be clear, the budget that you have from a production standpoint is based on the type curves in the Eagle Ford on the older completion design. Is that right? So that you wouldn't – you're not baking in uplift that you're experiencing on these initial set of wells? John D. Clayton - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President Yeah, we did put – without getting into too much detail, we did put – we call it proppant loading, we did put a factor on our type curves, when we went to the increased proppant north of 800 pounds per foot. This last well was 2,100 pounds per foot. So, we're obviously – the expectations – just to kind of a put you in the ballpark, Michael – the expectations on this well were probably on the high end 3,000 Boes per day at this early on in the test and we're double that right now. So if you took the type curve that we used, your ratio-ed it up for lateral length and then you put a little in for proppant loading, you'd get to that 3,000 Boe per day range and we're double that. So that is not in the guidance that we did, but I would just put an asterisk and say it's still pretty early in the flow back, but so far so good. Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Craddock for closing remarks. James E. Craddock - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer Great.
