How much would Marissa Mayer get to leave Yahoo? - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha May  2 2016, 02:33 ET | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor A new SEC filing reveals that Yahoo's (NASDAQ: YHOO ) board has agreed to a $55M severance package for the embattled chief executive if the company's auction of its Internet operations ends in a sale that ousts Meyer from her job. That's a lot of money for a CEO who hasn't been able to keep Yahoo's stock from falling. In 2015, the value of the firm's stock fell by a third, while her "actual" compensation totaled $14M, well above the $12M median paid to top executives in the S&P 500. Who agreed to such term in her contract? The board of directors ! Where are they today ? Who are these incompetent board of directors and why are they still in YHOO ? But why is she getting paid so much. OH wait... because she took the company down to losses. welcome to corporate America! You mean how much should she give back to the shareholders.  Talk is cheap and she has done NOTHING!   She is much worse than Carly!  She gives women a bad name in the corporate world. The board needs to be fired or publicly flogged on Saturday Morning TV. A disgrace to every customer of yahoo. If I am a Yahoo shareholder I would dump the shares and invest in snapchat or Apple.
