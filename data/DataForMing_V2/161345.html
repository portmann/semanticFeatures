Banking And Information Technology: Talk About Changing Paradigms - iShares U.S. Financials ETF (NYSEARCA:IYF) | Seeking Alpha Sep.  2, 2015  1:13 PM ET  |  About: iShares U.S. Financials ETF (IYF) , Includes: KBE , VFH , XLF by: John M. Mason Apple shows up as the number one non-bank competitor that banks fear. Bigger banks are still totally immersed in their branch banking business model, something the upcoming generations have no interest in. Other than what Apple Pay and Lending Club and others are doing, the larger banks seem to be totally clueless and the smaller banks seem to be totally irrelevant. The Wall Street Journal carries a headline in its online edition, " Big Banks Fear Apple More than Other Nonbank Competitors ." The author, Peter Rudegeai, writes, "ask any executive or board member at a bank what non-bank company do they most fear, and they are likely to name the world's biggest technology company, Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL )." Mr. Rudigeai reports that in a recent survey, following Apple, the next two companies of major concern are Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT ) and Lending Club Corp. (NYSE: LC ). "Many bank chiefs characterize their relationship with Apple in amicable terms… But, there are early signs of friction emerging between the banking industry and the tech giant." The point is, the world is changing and the major threat to banking, as I have been writing about for much of the past decade, is not from other banks but from technology. But the basic threat to the banking industry in this space is not information technology, in general, but information technology as it hits commercial banking's physical infrastructure, the branch banking system. In the area of "finance," banks have been doing OK. As the banks have built up investment banking divisions, wealth management divisions, risk management areas, and other areas in which modern corporate finance serves as the core foundation, information technology has been at the cutting edge. In fact, I have argued that the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was out-of-date for the big banks the minute it passed because the Act itself was aimed at fighting the last war and that the big banks had, in many cases, moved on beyond the coverage of the Act. But this was because the act was focused on the too-big-to-fail banks and the practices they used before the financial meltdown. It was, however, a different story for the "smaller" banks. Now, however, we are talking about the bread-and-butter of traditional banking, the individual banking customer, the family, the small business, the not-for-profit, and so on. We are talking about the area of paying checks and holding deposits, getting mortgages or consumer loans. We are talking about small business loans and other facilities that banks supply to "Main Street." The ironic thing is that John Kay in the Financial Times writes about modern bankers and about how bankers have changed over the past fifty years. "In the last 30 years, the field of investment banking had been transformed from a field that was dominated by people who were good at meeting clients at the 19th hole, to people who were good at solving very difficult mathematical problems that were involved in pricing derivative securities." For my story, I go back 40 years to when I first became a Finance Professor at the Wharton School, UPENN. At that time, Wharton offered no MBA courses in commercial banking. The argument was that commercial banks only recruited in the liberal arts schools because they wanted people who were in all the social clubs and who played golf and tennis and were social in other ways. I created the first graduate course in commercial banking at the Wharton School, called "Financial Management of Commercial Banks." This was in the early 1970s. The course was in the Finance Department and, hence the title, "Financial Management", and it attempted to bring all of modern financial theory to the course so that students could use what they were learning elsewhere in school. My students went to Wall Street. I don't know whether or not they could play golf or shine at a cocktail party, but they could do their maths and they understood the CAPM model and efficient markets and so on. They rose to good positions in the big banks and investment banks. Now, I look at the basic business of banking and I ask another question. The question I ask is "what are my grandchildren doing?" My grandchildren play games on the Internet with people all over the country, they write computer programs, they do maths on the Internet, they are on Twitter and sending text messages and on and on… and I don't know if they could even tell you what was inside of a bank building, let alone what a bank does. In the next few years, this generation is going to be the major driving force in retail banking, the heart of the commercial banking industry. I don't have any real confidence that they do, given where their actions tend to be, and hence the banks' fear of Apple, Wal-Mart, and Lending Club. If this is true, then it should shape one's view of how one should invest in the banking area and in the non-banking area. My investments tend to be of a longer-term nature. That is why, when I write about commercial banks, I ask questions like what is their focus, where are they investing in themselves, what kind of people do they have working for them and who is being promoted. Things like this point to the long-run performance of the organization. Right now, none of the larger commercial banks meet my standards. Most people I see writing about investing in banks are focusing on near-term results and "pumping up" existing business. My point is that this is changing. If bank managements have a "fear" of Apple, I want to know what they are doing about it. I know why they are afraid of Lending Club, but why are they afraid of Wal-Mart? The business model of commercial banks must change. Some of the change is coming with the decline in the numbers of commercial banks in existence. The banking system has been losing more than 200 banks per year for the past four years. From June 30, 2014, to June 30, 2015, the banking system lost 250 banks. And, these banks going out of business are primarily the smaller banks, community banks. They cannot keep up, they are non-competitive. The bigger banks are the ones that will be able to integrate information technology into their business model and compete on a worldwide basis. But the worldwide system will only have a small number of networks. The question then becomes, who is going to control these networks?
