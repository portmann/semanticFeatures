Apple Surges After Beating Expectations, Despite Forecasting Third Straight Revenue Decline | Zero Hedge by Tim Knight from... - Jul 26, 2016 3:11 PM The governments of the world..............they're going to keep doing this year after year, as long as they possibly can, and God only knows where it's leading us. by Knave Dave - Jul 26, 2016 3:03 PM The crude oil price rally has been completely crushed. That said, oil still has not gone back into the dark valley from which it came. While the plunge in Twitter share moments ago put those looking forward to AAPL's earnings on edge, Tim Cook delivered, beating on both the top and bottom line, reporting Q3 revenue of $42.4 billion, which declined 15% but above the $42.1 billion expected as a result of better than expected iPhone sales, with the company selling 40.4 million units in the quarter, down 15% but also above the 39.9 million expected. Helping the bulls, Apple said demand for the iPhone was getting stronger and that the decline in sales of its flagship device has passed the â€œlow pointâ€? Still, despite the beat Apple reported a decline in sales and profit lower by 27% Y/Y as a result of a 33% plunge in China sales, while forecasting a third straight quarterly revenue drop, dragged down by slowing demand for iPhones amid a lackluster global smartphone market and intensifying competition in China.

Analysts had predicted revenue of $42.1 billion. The drop marked the first back-to-back quarterly sales declines since 2002. Revenue from greater China slumped 33 percent. IPhone unit sales for the quarter fell 15 percent from a year earlier to 40.4 million. Still, that exceeded the average estimate of 39.9 million. Fourth-quarter revenue will be $45.5 billion to $47.5 billion, the Cupertino, California-based company said Tuesday in a statement. On average, analysts projected $45.5 billion. A year earlier, sales were $51.5 billion. revenue between $45.5 billion and $47.5 billion: this would represent a third quarterly decline in revenues gross margin between 37.5 percent and 38 percent With the iPhone accounting for almost two-thirds of sales, Apple has felt the brunt of a slowdown in the global smartphone market. Thatâ€™s been made worse by deterioration in China, where consumers are choosing cheaper handsets over Apple products - even the low-end iPhone SE introduced earlier this year. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has sought to emphasize surging revenue from services, such as the App Store, iCloud storage and Apple Music, as a way of making up for cooling device sales. Yet those businesses still represent just a fraction of revenue compared with the iPhone, which may not be significantly revamped until next year as consumers wait ever longer to upgrade their handsets. Luca Maestri, chief financial officer, told the FT that Apple was able to clear more iPhone inventory than it had anticipated and that unit sales fell less than they had done in March, which he said had â€œturned out to be the low point for our cycleâ€?. â€œCustomer demand for our products was stronger than we had anticipated 90 days ago on a number of fronts." Revenues from the iPad also grew for the first time in many quarters, thanks to the higher-priced iPad Pro, although on a unit basis the tablet continued to decline. What Tim Cook said in the earnings release: â€œWe are pleased to report third quarter results that reflect stronger customer demand and business performance than we anticipated at the start of the quarter,â€? said Tim Cook, Appleâ€™s CEO. â€œWe had a very successful launch of iPhone SE and weâ€™re thrilled by customersâ€™ and developersâ€™ response to software and services we previewed at WWDC in June.â€? â€œOur Services business grew 19 percent year-over-year and App Store revenue was the highest ever, as our installed base continued to grow and transacting customers hit an all-time record,â€? said Luca Maestri, Appleâ€™s CFO. â€œWe returned over $13 billion to investors through share repurchases and dividends, and we have now completed almost $177 billion of our $250 billion capital return program.â€? Finally, while last quarter the market threw up all over the company's earnings, this time the kneejerk reaction has been favorable, pushing the stock over 5% higher.   â€œWe returned over $13 billion to investors through share repurchases and dividends, and we have now completed almost $177 billion of our $250 billion capital return program.â€?  $73B to go. 27% drop in earnings yoy, 30% drop in china sales etc. its like a professor saying to the class, you only need to get a 25 on the exam to pass, and everyone gets a 30. how can something in a real world be considered positive when revenue declined 15 percent year over year, as well as iphone sales. its all bullshit ironicmerman thismarketisrigged Jul 26, 2016 5:06 PM TradingIsLifeBrah thismarketisrigged Jul 26, 2016 5:06 PM I said that earlier about JPM's dumbass argument that people will be forgoing the iPhone 7 to wait for the rumored "better" iPhone in 2017.  Every year there is a new iPhone and all consumers know that, no one is going to not buy this year because they are going to wait for next year's phone because next year there will be an even better phone coming the year after that.  What it does do is allows JPM to lower their Q3 revenue targets and allow Apple to roll over the bar.  Growth is dead for the company, its basically a value/dividend stock now. voicefromgermany Jul 26, 2016 5:10 PM Apart from declining smartphone sales worldwide due to market saturation Chinese producers gain market shares per month in double digits with homemade products.
