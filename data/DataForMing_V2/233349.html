'Disney Infinity 3.0' launches as gaming test for Apple TV - Sony Corporation (NYSE:SNE) | Seeking Alpha To screen ETFs by asset class, performance, yield and more, check out the ETF Hub. ETF Hub Nov 11 2015, 19:30 ET | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Walt Disney ( DIS -0.8%) launched Disney Infinity 3.0 for the Apple TV today, and unlike many games for the box, it comes with a chunky controller usually seen with higher-end gaming consoles. That could prove a critical test of whether the platform could support more intense gaming, and present real competition to the top two consoles made by Sony (NYSE: SNE ) or Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ). Most all games on Apple TV are controlled by the device's slender remote. But the Nimbus controller made by SteelSeries (specifically for Apple's device) features analog sticks and D-pads familiar to console gamers, and sells for $50 (but at a $15 discount in the Infinity 3.0 bundle). Disney's entry in the toys-to-life category has underperformed compared to Activision Blizzard's Skylanders -- also now on Apple TV -- but the combination of content brands that Disney can leverage for the free-form game, including Marvel and Star Wars, has kept hopes high for the platform. That superb collaboration, well i though that 7% stake was non-controlling and just financial (after Disney bought Pixar). unless DIS and AAPL just have a superb relationships which is great. Disney and Apple do have a strong collaborative relationship. Remember that Bob Iger sits on Apple's BoD. When Apple launches their streaming service early next year, I expect Disney will be very involved.
