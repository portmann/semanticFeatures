Verizon workers threaten to strike - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha Jul 26 2015, 08:26 ET | About: Verizon Communications (VZ) | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) workers on the U.S. East Coast have voted to go on strike, if necessary, over a dispute about a new contract. "Our members...reject management's harsh concessionary demands, including the elimination of job security, sharp increases in workers' health care costs, and slashing retirement security," Union Communications Workers of America said in a statement. Will they be showing up at the private homes of management and scaring the occupants? Only time will tell if they do it again. Stagnant stock, though a good dividend, and a boatload of debt. I don't know the details this time around to have a truly informed position, but history would suggest I lean toward the company. As a stockholder, I want my interests upheld first as that makes the company stronger and more competitive, which will enable better wages for employees over the long haul. The sector is too volatile to "give away the farm". If the majority of the jobs are not high skilled, replace them if need be - but I can also say they should trim the fat and pay from upper level management too. One thing for sure, it's difficult to find jobs any more that offer retirement benefits at all.
