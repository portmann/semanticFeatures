Intel: With Irrational Exuberance Gone, It's Time For Another Look - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha After the recent pre-announcement, Intel shares might be worth another look. Overly optimistic PC expectations appear to have been reset. DCG growth, one of the keys to the Intel story, appears well-supported. "Remember, stocks never trade at fair value. They trade at what people are willing to pay for them." - a friend of mine And so it goes with Intel ( INTC ), my on-again off-again object of fascination. I decided to sell out of my position in the mid-to-high $30s, despite knowing I might be leaving upside on the table, because I was no longer comfortable with the risk/reward at that valuation meeting my personal requirements. On the back of what boils down to merely one data point, the stock has since sold off nearly 20%, making the name one investors might consider taking a second look at. While I was, for a long time, more constructive on PCs than most investors, that equation flipped around late last year and early this year. I thought the idea that low-powered tablets would kill the PC was patently absurd (and indeed, iPad sales ended up hitting a wall). At the same time, though, PCs don't really strike me as a major growth market, so I was a bit skeptical of projections for PCs to return to long-term growth, even if single-digit. The increasing prevalence of hosted/SaaS software (including packages like Office and CS that were traditionally local) means that the segment of users requiring lots of local processing capacity will likely continue to narrow, and more portable/less powerful 2-in-1s will continue to gain popularity. There will be troughs and valleys, but I think my long-term forecast is probably flat-to-down slightly. To me, the Intel thesis has always been this: where massive amounts of computing power are needed, there will be Intel. Strong growth in DCG is well-supported (and despite the pre-announce, management seemed to suggest that DCG expectations are unchanged). Over the past few months, several meetings have confirmed my beliefs here. The (soon to be former) management of Mavenir (NYSE: MVNR ) seemed convinced that the ramp of VoLTE and NFV will lead to a significant replacement of ASICs and other custom silicon within the telecom stack with off-the-shelf blades powered by, you guessed it, Intel Xeons. A recent meeting with Applied Micro (NASDAQ: AMCC ) left me unconvinced that ARM servers are anything more than vaporware at this point. The biggest question remaining is mobile losses. I've been growing somewhat less bullish on Intel's mobile prospects than I once was (primarily due to fatigue - to some degree, it keeps being a next-year story), but they did just win a modem slot from Qualcomm in the iPhone, and they also nailed their audacious tablet-chip goal. While mobile losses should narrow, there's significant execution risk here, and at least for me, it's become a show-me story. I haven't really gone back to update my model, but I still think fair value for Intel is somewhere in the mid-$30s, making the current price decently attractive for certain types of investors, especially in light of the strong dividend. Intel's management team seems to be doing all the right things, and the company's IP moat is significant. I don't directly own INTC, as I have much higher-return uses for capital elsewhere, but I did write some $29-strike monthly puts on INTC in a yield-focused family account (hence the disclosure). If prices continue falling into the high or mid $20s, I would likely consider writing more puts or even purchasing shares outright in my own account.
