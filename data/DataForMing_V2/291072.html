ETF Hub Jan 15 2016, 03:17 ET | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor Within a few weeks, Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) subscribers will no longer be able to use proxies to watch content not available in their home country. "If all of our content were globally available, there wouldn't be a reason for members to use proxies or unblockers," David Fullagar, Netflix's vice president of content delivery architecture, wrote in a blog. The announcement comes just a week after the company went live in more than 130 countries, covering almost the entire globe except China. i hope they understand that a good amount of people use proxies on thier routers so the isp wont see that they are streaming netflix and throttle them, like comcast does to me :/ Many people already have Netflix in the countries that were recently added. In Iceland, it has been estimated that 17% of the population subscribe to Netflix. Quite good for a service that was not supposed to be available. The content library that will be available in Iceland will be far smaller than the US one, so if Netflix successfully blocks the US service in Iceland, they might actually lose some subscribers by coming to the country (although a net increase is to be expected). Iceland is a tiny market and perhaps not the most representative for the countries that were recently added, but this effect is something to consider. VPN providers will simply adapt, and even if they miraculously manage to stop VPN's, all that will happen is people will stop subscribing and get the same content from other sources, something Netflix does not want to see happen. Obviously Netflix enjoys the revenues from all subscribers, so the last thing they want to do is cut them out, however they have to appear to be trying, so as to appease the content providers who still think that they are living in the last century.  Limiting content based on geography makes no sense in today's' interconnected world, eventually it will have to end no matter if they want it to or not.
