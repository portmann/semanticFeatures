Why Dialog Semiconductor Is A Buy - Dialog Semiconductor Plc (OTCMKTS:DLGNF) | Seeking Alpha Dialog Semi, an Apple supplier, sold off sharply after issuing weak guidance for Q4 on Monday. In light of Apple's earnings report, the sell off appears to be completely inappropriate. Continuing revenue from Apple, combined with the Atmel acquisition, are reasons for investors to take advantage of Dialog's temporarily low valuation. Dialog Semiconductor ( OTC:DLGNF ), a well known maker of power management chips for the iPhone, reported its results on Monday . Despite impressive y/y gains in revenue and operating income in Q3, the stock lost 20% the following day, based on weak guidance for Q4. Much of this had to do with excessive concern about the implications of Dialog's guidance on Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) future growth. The market's overreaction represents a buying opportunity. In the run up to an Apple earnings report, Apple's chip suppliers tend to receive a lot of scrutiny, and Dialog is among them. Dialog's earnings report actually represented good news for the September quarter, both for it and for Apple. Dialog's revenue for the quarter was up 17.5% y/y to $330.4 million, while operating profit was up 44% y/y to $60.37 million. Dialog's 17.5% y/y revenue gain matched up fairly well with Apple's 22% iPhone unit sales gain. As shown by the iFixit teardown of the iPhone 6s, the phone contains a Dialog power management IC. Dialog's Mobile Systems segment generated more than 80% of revenue in Q3, and most of that appears to come from Apple. So the investment thesis for Dialog is relatively straightforward, that Dialog's fortunes are tied to Apple's. It was Dialog's guidance for Q4 that spooked investors. Dialog guided to $430-460 million in revenue for a y/y growth range of -1% to 5.7%. At the midpoint of $445, this represented just 2% y/y growth for Q4. A Dialog Power Management IC was also aboard the iPhone 6, so Dialog also faced a tough y/y comp going in to Q4. This also turned out to correlate fairly well with Apple's guidance of 1-4% y/y growth I discussed in my review of Apple's September quarter earnings. On the surface, it might seem that the reaction to the Dialog announcement was justified. It really did represent a bell weather of sorts for Apple's guidance. Certainly, Dialog's guidance indicates that Apple hasn't just arbitrarily low balled their guidance for the December quarter. Dialog's guidance for Q4 represents what they already expect in semiconductor sales revenue for the quarter from Apple. So it appears that Apple is applying the brakes across the iPhone supply chain. On the basis of what I consider to be a genuine slow down in growth for Apple, I cautioned fellow Apple investors that I couldn't recommend the stock as a Buy. I consider Apple a Hold, at least until Apple reports the December quarter. That means I'm literally holding my Apple stock, and taking a wait and see approach until the results come in. While investors received Apple's earnings report and guidance positively, with a 4% bump the following day, the reaction to the Dialog report seems totally inappropriate. The 20% selloff after Dialog's report just isn't consistent with the response to Apple's earnings report and guidance. In my view, the overreaction to Dialog represents an opportunity to buy the stock fairly cheaply. Slower growth is not negative growth, and Dialog stands to benefit from continued sales of iPhone and potentially other Apple devices in the future. If there's a downside to being an Apple supplier, it's becoming too dependent on Apple. Probably, Dialog is a little too dependent on Apple right now. Dialog is taking advantage of its recent Apple-fueled growth to diversify by buying another small semiconductor maker Atmel (NASDAQ: ATML ) for $4.6 billion in cash and stock. As described in Dialog's press release , the combined company will have about $2.7 billion in annual revenues and possess a broadened product portfolio. Atmel makes ARM-based microcontrollers that are used in IoT platforms and Automotive. An ARM-based IoT platform is probably the best bet for growth in commodity processors that anyone could make. Buying Atmel is a very savvy acquisition that adds to the customer base as well as opening up new markets for Dialog's products. There's very little overlap between the products of the two companies, but cost savings of $150 million are projected, probably on the basis of reduced G&A. Dialog is expected to fund the transaction partly with cash and stock, partly through $2.1 billion in new debt. Cash flow from combined operations of the two companies should be more than enough to service the debt. There is some risk that Dialog could be taking on the Atmel acquisition at precisely the wrong moment, if you believe that the sky is about to fall on Apple. I don't. Slower growth is not a reason to sell Apple, and neither is it a reason to sell Dialog. But the risk must be acknowledged. Certainly, diversification is the best way for Dialog to address that risk. For prospective investors in Dialog, the main risk is in delay. There are already signs that the stock price is recovering from the near hysterical reaction to Dialog's earnings report. It's still well below its pre-earnings high, but I don't expect that to last. Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
