Apple Watch: JD Power Survey In Stark Contrast To Media Coverage - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha A new J.D. Power survey ranks Apple Watch number one in customer satisfaction. The survey argues against critics' claims that customers are losing interest in the Watch. According to a report released yesterday by J.D. Power , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Watch ranks number one in customer satisfaction among smartwatch owners. The Power survey provides objective evidence that the Watch is a hit and not the flop it is often portrayed in the media. The J.D. Power survey indicates that smartwatch owners in general are very satisfied with their watches. The average score was 847 out of a possible 1000 points. As the chart below shows, Apple ranked highest in customer satisfaction. As is usually the case in Power's surveys, the numerical rankings tend to be fairly tightly grouped, but Apple was the only brand to perform better than average, as the "circle ratings" make clear. I was not surprised by the results. Apple's product execution is invariably superior to its competition, and usually it's only on the basis of price or value that Apple suffers in comparison. What I find most interesting about the Power survey is how much it diverges from prominent media coverage of the Watch since its launch more than a year ago. It's not difficult to find any number of highly critical, even dismissive articles about the Watch. An excellent example of this is CNET's article at the one year anniversary of Watch titled "7 reasons people aren't wearing their Apple Watch". The article captures the key techniques one finds in biased media coverage of Apple's products. These are the highly selective presentation of anecdotal evidence to support the negative viewpoint, combined with a sweeping generalization that the public at large agrees with the negative viewpoint. So, people aren't wearing their Apple Watch. Apparently these people didn't take the Power survey. The 7 reasons? It doesn't do enough. Limited strap options. Faster to pull phone out of pocket. Too complicated. Uninteresting apps. Not for me. No killer feature. These criticism have been echoed in any number of Watch anniversary articles. Tech Insider concluded "The Apple Watch isn't the breakthrough product we were hoping for", while claiming that the Watch did too much. Business Insider chose to focus on the dissatisfaction of developers with Watch as a platform: "I think you have a lot of people wanting to build something for the Apple Watch because it's this new platform and they want to get in on this new platform. But I think the Apple Watch is a niche product compared to, say, the iPhone," Adam Grossman, CEO of Dark Sky, tells Business Insider. Daisuke Wakabayashi's anniversary article in the Wall Street Journal was probably the best balanced. He points out that the estimated 12 million Watches Apple sold in the first year were about double that of iPhone in its first year. But even then, he tends to dwell excessively on the negative anecdotal evidence: And yet, there are detractors such as Fred Wilson, co-founder of venture-capital firm Union Square Ventures, in December declared the Watch a "flop." Mr. Wilson, who owns shares of Fitbit through a fund, had earlier predicted the Watch wouldn't be a "home run" like the iPad, iPhone and iPod, saying many people wouldn't want to wear a computer on their wrist. A venture capitalist who's invested in Fitbit (NYSE: FIT ) declares the Watch a flop. Oh my, what a surprise. He then makes some sweeping generalizations of his own: Perhaps the biggest challenge is the Watch's lack of a defining purpose. It does certain things well, such as activity tracking, mobile payments and notifications. But there is no task the Apple Watch handles that can't be done by an iPhone or a less-expensive activity tracker. Lack of defining purpose? What do we expect the Watch to do? Inform people of the meaning of existence when they put it on? And his assertion that there's nothing that the Watch does that the iPhone can't do is patently untrue. Last I checked, no iPhone was equipped with a heart rate sensor. Nor can they be conveniently strapped to the wrist. It's not that I ever thought Watch was perfect. I've voiced my own criticisms on a number of occasions, and some of those echo the criticisms common in the media. It is too slow. It doesn't do enough, especially when it comes to communication. It's too dependent on iPhone. But all of these criticisms serve to obscure where Watch is going. The first generation Watch is just the start. As its electronics shrink and become more energy efficient, Apple will be able to build in more functionality. This is inevitable. The only question is how rapidly. Wakabayashi even mentions at the bottom of his article that Apple plans to add cellular communication to the next generation Watch. That would be sooner than I expect. I actually think standalone WiFi connections will come first, along with the ability to install apps directly using WiFi. Cellular will probably happen on the third generation. As I wrote back in May , I believe that Apple Watch is destined to become a main communications device for voice and text messages, supplanting smartphones for that purpose. The basis for this assertion is the greater energy efficiency afforded by the Watch, the general trend of miniaturization of electronics, and the greater convenience offered by a wrist born device. Regardless of whether this communications focus for the Watch comes to pass, it's clear that Apple can continue to add useful functionality to the Watch (a camera for Facetime and selfies), and continue to satisfy customers. Satisfying customers, rather than Apple's innumerable critics, is what it's all about. All too often, we see Apple critics resorting to sweeping generalizations based on flimsy anecdotal evidence. Rumors indicate that iPhone 7 won't be "innovative" so the sweeping generalization is made that everyone "hates" a product that hasn't yet seen the light of day. I chose to write about the Power survey, not so much to tout the success of the Watch as to highlight the fallacious nature of the anecdotal approach to Apple criticism. I would like to see a somewhat more objective basis for Apple criticism in the media, but I don't expect it. It appears that the anecdotal approach has been effective in undermining investor confidence in Apple to some degree. I urge investors to focus on objective information such as the J.D. Power survey whenever possible. I continue to be long Apple and recommend it as a buy for investors with e 3-5 year investment horizon. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.
