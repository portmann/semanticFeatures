3 Reasons AT&T's Lower Wireless Churn May Not Matter - AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) | Seeking Alpha AT&T's wireless revenue is growing slower than Verizon's and there is one obvious reason. To say that AT&T's wireless postpaid net additions are confusing is an understatement. Many people are making a big deal about how AT&T (NYSE: T ) posted extremely low churn in its postpaid wireless subscribers. On the surface this sounds like great news, but AT&T's postpaid churn hasn't been that bad in the first place. Over the last several quarters, AT&T has been within a quarter of a percent of Verizon's postpaid churn rate. In addition, there are bigger issues facing AT&T's future, and three of these challenges should worry investors in particular. Millions of people grew up with the Sesame Street song called One Of These Things. The song's premise is to show kids how to tell the difference between things that are similar versus not. When it comes to AT&T's recent earnings , there are a few things that are not like Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) or local competitor Frontier Communications (NASDAQ: FTR ). We'll focus first on how AT&T's wireless group isn't doing as well overall as Verizon. On the one hand, AT&T did post a 1.02% postpaid churn rate , but Verizon nearly matched this at 1.03%. That being said, AT&T's wireless revenue only grew by 1.8%, compared to Verizon's wireless revenue growth of 6.9% . As if that isn't bad enough, the driving force behind both company's growth was their equipment revenue growth. AT&T grew equipment revenue by 36%, but Verizon grew this same line item by 80%. Clearly customers are choosing to upgrade a significant number of handsets through Verizon's EDGE program. Though AT&T's NEXT program offers similar benefits, the difference in equipment growth speaks for itself. One of these things just doesn't belong… The second issue with AT&T's recent earnings is the reported numbers for postpaid additions. On the one hand, AT&T reported 441,000 postpaid wireless net additions. By comparison, Verizon reported 565,000 retail net postpaid additions. On the one hand, Verizon's base of postpaid subscribers is larger, so a larger number of additions isn't surprising. There is one issue with some of the math that AT&T used to report its postpaid additions. The company reported that it added 441,000 postpaid wireless subs, as well as 684,000 connected cars, and 711,000 postpaid tablet net adds. The combined total of these additions is 1.83 million postpaid net additions. So the question investors should ask is, why did AT&T say that it added 1.2 million total wireless net additions? The only way this number makes sense is if we round up the combination of postpaid wireless net adds and the postpaid tablets. Of course this begs the question, why are nearly 700,000 "connected cars" not being counted? The bottom line is, either AT&T doesn't have much faith in these connected cars being worth much, or they don't know if these customers will use these connections. In either case, reporting such a significant number of connections and then not including them in the total should give investors a pause. The third problem facing AT&T is the company's old school cash cow is dying faster than its peers. Local telecom companies like Frontier, CenturyLink, and Windstream all are trying to stem land line losses while growing their Internet and business operations. AT&T and Verizon are moving in different directions, with Verizon focusing on its wireless business and AT&T looking to DIRECTV (NASDAQ: DTV ) to diversify. What is consistent among each of these companies is, they generate significant free cash flow from their landline business. The bad news for AT&T is, these customers are leaving at an alarming rate relative to its peers. In the company's last quarter, AT&T lost nearly 13% of its voice line customers on a year-over-year basis. By comparison, Verizon lost less than half this percentage at just over 6% and Frontier did even better with switched access minutes down under 4% . It's true that the potential of the DIRECTV deal could change AT&T's revenue significantly, but it's never a good thing when your original cash cow is bleeding out twice as fast as your competition. The bottom line is, A&T may have posted a better churn rate in its wireless business than it had in a while. This churn rate may have been better than Verizon, but that is just one very small part of the puzzle. With slower revenue growth, a confusing picture of postpaid net additions, and a voice line business dying much faster than its peers, AT&T has problems. It's worrisome that AT&T's existing businesses have these kinds of challenges, if investors assume the DIRECTV deal will change the direction of the company. One of these things is not like the others, and maybe it's AT&T's stock that doesn't belong in investors' portfolios.
