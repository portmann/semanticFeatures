Verizon: New Utility Play - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha Verizon keeps surging higher due to the attractiveness of the dividend based on the utility concept. The upcoming costs of the spectrum auction could scare off conservative dividend investors. The stock is cheaper than the average utility stock, but the wireless provider is having trouble steering clear of the hazards to obtain the higher valuation. Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ ) continues to rally after moving beyond the union strike and alleviating the fears of an irrational bid for Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ). The key to the investment is not getting too high or too low considering the company is moving towards a utility type investment with one big concern. The stock hit a new high of nearly $57 as dividend paying stocks surge after Brexit fears sent bond yields lower and high dividend paying stocks higher. The question now is whether Verizon is riding that trend too high? The good news is that the unions recently ratified the new contracts before too much damage was done. As my last article detailed, the strike was on the verge of damaging the Verizon wireless brand that could've had long-term impacts. As well, several sources including CNBC confirmed that Verizon offered no more than $3.5 billion for certain Yahoo assets eliminating any material impact from and over reaching deal. With the debt load discussed below, the original concern were the suggestions that Verizon was the leading bidder in a deal that could cost up to $10 billion. The recent stock rally has shown that when the company stays away from potentially disastrous scenarios like a bitter union strike and a pricey bid for questionable assets, the stock will react favorably to the nice dividend. As the wireless market matures, Verizon could easily be considered similar to a utility. Though that might sound like a negative, it isn't in the current market that continues paying up for the consistent dividends of utilities. In comparison to Verizon, a group of utility stocks like American Electric Power (NYSE: AEP ), Consolidated Edison (NYSE: ED ), and Southern Company (NYSE: SO ) average smaller dividends than the 4.0% offered by Verizon. As the forward P/E multiple chart below highlights, Verizon has plenty of multiple expansion ahead to catch these utility stocks. The bad news for a highly-indebted industry is that the Federal Communications Commission wants $86.4 billion for the wireless airwaves obtained from the television broadcasters. Wireless firms like AT&T (NYSE: T ) and Verizon spent somewhat aggressively on the auctions last year so this is a staggering amount. According to the WSX, analysts were expecting wireless providers to spend roughly $30 billion on the forward auction suggesting that the reverse auction might need more rounds to reduce prices and spectrum to more reasonable levels. Verizon ended Q1 with roughly $109.9 billion in debt on the balance sheet. The amount is manageable as the domestic wireless leader generates positive free cash flow though the $2.3 billion in quarterly dividends eats up a lot of the cash flows. These initial spectrum amounts aren't reasons to panic, but the domestic wireless market remains under pricing pressure and not supportive of wild spending on spectrum. The stock market is going to quickly frown on Verizon spending excessive amounts on spectrum that adds to these debt loads. Based on the utility concept, Verizon might have some upside considering the strong demand for a 4% yield at any price. The big downside is that excessive spectrum spending would again negate the positives focused on the utility concept. Investors can ride Verizon higher, but the valuations are getting extremely expensive to buy and hold into the up coming costly spectrum auction.
