Apple To $140: Making Higher Highs And Higher Lows; Funds Desperately Want Back In - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha My prediction is now just 5.6% away from the $140 goal. If not for the Fed and other stupid things going on in the market, AAPL stock would be at $138 by now. Mutual funds that foolishly bailed on AAPL, attempting to beat Apple longs to the punch by selling before the "stock's demise", have realized their mistake. We are now three weeks into my prediction that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) shares will reach $140 by the end of May . What does it all mean, you wonder? Give us more, Richard. But does it need to be rationalized as anything other than I believe AAPL stock is going up? No. I read tons of AAPL articles here on Seeking Alpha and elsewhere - regurgitating the same dull mathematical equations. Apple has "XXX amount of cash and sells XXX number of smartphones at XXX gross margin." Put all of this 'genius' math together and it spews out $XXX price at XXX multiple compared to the S&P 500. That type of content makes you feel good - I get it. But Seeking Alpha needs more of me and less of the monotonous cookie-cutter material you can easily find on the internet. Look, I own AAPL stock and have been an investor for more than five years. I have a core position, focused solely on Apple's fundamentals and the company's improvements. At the same time, however, I'm an active trader. I own a block of shares that I trade in and out of based on various chart patterns. And Apple's chart has shown and continues to show that the stock is coiling to strike like a rattlesnake. So far, the shorts have been smart enough (it seems) to get out of the way and avoid being bitten. If it were not for the Fed and other stupid things going on in the market, which have nothing to do with Apple, AAPL stock would be at $138 by now, not $132. In fact, when this week began, all indications pointed to a $135 close. AAPL stock closed Friday at $132.54, up almost 1% and narrowly missing $133 (high of $132.97) during Friday's trading session. And if you're keeping score at home - and why wouldn't you - my prediction is now just 5.6% away from the $140 goal. Can it get there? Obviously it will take a miracle - let's just cut through the chase. But whether the stock reaches $140 by the end of May is besides the point. It's a matter of "when," not "if." As for what $140 means? I plan on taking profits in my trading position. There's nothing wrong with that. As I've said on three other occasions, Apple longs are now in control of the stock. At each important time period, the bears have gotten crushed as AAPL stock continues to make higher highs and higher lows. Take a look at the table. Apple's price movements, especially the 5-day 2.93% climb, continue to indicate a strong momentum move upward is imminent. Not to mention, the stock has now found a solid floor above $130. I'd like the volume to be higher, but $140 can still be taken out quick. Why? Mutual funds that foolishly bailed on AAPL, attempting to beat Apple longs to the punch by selling before the "stock's demise", have realized their mistake. These funds are now underweight the shares and are eager to get back in. They want the stock at a cheaper price. They missed the drop earlier this month to $123.36 in anticipation of the quarterly dividend and will be forced to re-establish their positions ahead of the WWDC in June. With AAPL stock up 20% of the year, dominating the indexes, these fund that are holding retirement money, pensions and other such capital, can no longer afford to "play it safe." They risk losing more of their client's money. Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn thinks shares of AAPL are worth $240 today - he's called a genius. I've suggested AAPL stock will reach $140 by the end of May - I'm called the crazy. Do I agree with Carl Icahn? You bet I do. But help me understand how it gets to $240 without crossing $140?
