null RAF FAIRFORD, England, July 8 Canada talked to five potential bidders on Thursday to map out the next steps in a protracted effort to replace an aging fleet of CF-18 fighter jets built by Boeing, industry and government officials said on Friday. Defence ministry spokesman Evan Koronewski said Ottawa  would assess its options over the summer, in part to determine if Canada still needed to purchase the 65 jets it initially planned. Industry sources said representatives of Boeing, Dassault, Eurofighter, Lockheed Martin  and Saab took part in a conference call with Canadian agencies on Thursday. Koronewski said the government would weigh up issues such as costs, delivery times, readiness, interoperability with North American Aerospace Defense Command and economic benefits. Boeing wants Canada to buy its F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, which is nearing the end of production, instead of the Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter jet that was backed by the previous Conservative government. Canada paid to help develop the F-35, and many Canadian firms produce parts for the plane, but those orders could disappear if Ottawa opts for a rival, since countries that order jets are entitled to industrial participation in the program. Canada's ruling Liberals government vowed during the 2015 election campaign to ban the F-35 from a new competition, though officials have since softened their stance amid warnings from Lockheed it could pull nearly $1 billion in orders from Canadian firms if Ottawa quit the program. Thursday's call was seen as a sign that Canada would open the competition to all potential bidders, but few details were immediately available. "We believe this is a positive first step to an open competition and Lockheed Martin remains confident that the F-35 is the best and most affordable solution," said Lockheed spokesman Joe LaMarca. Lockheed, which is showcasing the F-35 at two British air shows this week and next, is confident the plane could win in an open competition. The cost of the jets has also come down considerably since bids were initially submitted. Lockheed officials say the F-35 will cost around $85 million, including an engine, in 2019. Boeing argues it can supply its Super Hornets at a more competitive price. It is also offering Canadian firms work on its commercial jets if Ottawa decides to buy the F/A-18E/F. "Boeing stands ready to support the government of Canada's consultation process," said a spokesman. Boeing has over the past five years awarded Canadian companies $6 billion in direct contracts, the spokesman added.
