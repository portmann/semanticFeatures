ETF Hub Jun  7 2015, 06:45 ET | About: Google Inc. (GOOG) | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor Google's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) new mobile phone payment service, Android Pay, will not garner any transaction fees from credit card companies, WSJ reports , possibly putting pressure on Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) to drop or lower its charges for Apple Pay. Dominant payment networks, Visa (NYSE: V ) MasterCard (NYSE: MA ), recently standardized their "tokenization" card-security service and made it free, preventing payment services from charging fees to issuers. "This is a bold move on behalf of the banks," said Rick Oglesby, head of research at Double Diamond Payments Research. After agreeing to Apple's terms for Apple Pay, "they’re now taking a stand against similar deals. It could easily turn into a standoff." Apple Pay currently receives 0.15% of the value of each credit card transaction and collects a half-cent per purchase on bank debit cards. While GOOG would miss out, it's not likely users will flee AAPL's ecosystem for Android for this one issue.  Nice to be first-to-market! First to the market?? Apple is no where near first to the market. Not even second.  Lol. Google has had mobile NFC payments for several years.  I've personally been using it for over two years.  Sine 2003 over 90% of all android phones shipped with NFC chips.  One the other had apple did not add NFC technology until 2015 and only in iPhone 6. I doubt that this will put much pressure on Apple. Apple can receive higher rates because their customers are likely to spend much more money than Android users. It is similar with American Express. Google is an add based business. At the end all of its "free" goodies have the implici cost of lack of privacy and tons of unwelcome adds. Right on!  And, this is going to be an interesting war---privacy first and foremost or free but give up your innermost held secrets.  Cook has drawn the battle lines. It's not what the consumer will want but whether the credit card companies want to keep paying Apple. Theirs is the decision that will be the deciding factor and knowing how greedy American Banks and Credit Card suppliers are they won't want to lose that 0.15%. Goog having any information on me is scary! I do not let Goog on my computer and I surely will not let them into my wallet! The whole point of TouchID with Apple Pay is convenient and security.  Why should the iOS users nor the banks trust Google?  Seems like Google is quite desperate!
