The paper did not say when the raid took place. Amazon Japan is suspected of imposing conditions on retailers such as forcing them to sell products at a lower price if they were also advertising on other online shopping sites, the Nikkei said, citing sources with knowledge of the case. A Fair Trade Commission spokesman said he could not confirm the report but added: "I won't say the contents are incorrect."
