null Reuters/Morteza Nikoubazl/File photo NEW YORK Boeing Co (BA.N) has signed an agreement to sell jetliners to Iran Air, the company said on Tuesday, confirming Iranian statements about the deal and briefly sending its shares up sharply in early trading. Boeing said in a statement that it had signed a memorandum of understanding with Iran Air "expressing the airline's intent to purchase Boeing commercial passenger airplanes." Iran Air is the state carrier of Iran, a country with an aging aircraft fleet. Boeing's statement said it had held talks that led to the memorandum of understanding "under authorizations from the U.S. government following a determination that Iran had met its obligations under the nuclear accord reached last summer." Two senior Republican members of Congress raised concerns last week that the sale could threaten U.S. national security. The company said it would "continue to follow the lead of the U.S. government with regards to working with Iran's airlines. It added that "any and all contracts with Iran's airlines will be contingent upon U.S. government approval." Boeing declined to provide details about the number or type of planes it would sell, nor the timetable for delivery of the aircraft. But a large order is expected following Iran's agreement in January to purchase 118 Airbus (AIR.PA) aircraft worth $27 billion at list prices. Iran disclosed the agreement with Boeing on Friday, the first purchase of Boeing jetliners since the Islamic Revolution in 1979. Boeing shares rose nearly 2.78 percent following that news. The head of Iran's Civil Aviation Organization, Ali Abedzadeh, told the state-run daily newspaper Iran that a written agreement had been signed with Boeing to buy 100 Boeing aircraft. The Iranian statement confirmed a Reuters report on June 6 that Iran was moving toward a deal to buy more than 100 jetliners from the Chicago-based aircraft maker. Boeing shares were down 0.56 percent at $132.00 in late morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Earlier in the day, the stock had climbed to $133.18 from a low of $132.25.
