Try This 4.6%-Yielding Portfolio On For Size | Seeking Alpha Casey Hoerth , Casey's Finance Journal (Blog) (434 clicks) Although stocks are a bit higher than they were a week ago, there is still a broad swath of good value out there. Back on August 17th, I wrote an article recommending a portfolio of four "accidentally high-yielding" stocks for any beginning income investor . The purpose of that article was to give a handful of stocks that provide both income and diversification. My four choices back then were the following: Royal Bank of Canada (NYSE: RY ), Omega Healthcare Investors (NYSE: OHI ), AT&T (NYSE: T ) and ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP ). So first, a mea culpa: I shouldn't have added Conoco to that list. As I calculated in a previous article, Conoco's dividend is on life support at $45 WTI . My previous energy pick, Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD ), was the safer pick and is indeed back on the list this time around. This article, by the way, is a continuation of the last. Due to the volatility of the last few weeks, I swapped all names but one. I will explain my rationale with each name as I go. I always like to have at least one healthcare stock in the portfolio, so my first choice is Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ ), which replaced Omega Healthcare Investors. To be sure, Omega is still a good deal; it's a little bit higher than it was, but not by much. I included J&J in this portfolio because it represents perhaps the least-volatile choice of the four within this portfolio. Since August 17th, J&J fell from $98 to some $93. As a medical company, J&J benefits from the trend of steadily growing healthcare expenditure around the world (thanks to a steadily-aging global population). J&J is a medical conglomerate with three focuses: Consumer goods, medical devices and pharmaceuticals. Since 2009, J&J has grown dividends by an average of 7.4%, compounded. Management expects EPS growth between 4.5% and 6% this year, despite strong currency headwinds. I suspect that J&J would do even better if the dollar would only stop rising. J&J is a world-class company, and it has traded at a premium for several years, but, as we will see, that premium has been pulled back. Over the last 10 years, J&J has averaged a P/E of 15.4 times. Since early 2013, J&J has traded above its average 10-year valuation, but this pullback has brought J&J down to 15.2 times earnings. While J&J isn't at a discount, what you will get is a solid 3.3% yield with a long runway of high single-digit earnings growth ahead. I think that makes J&J a buy. Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) is my second choice, and it replaces AT&T from last time. Both telecoms are good buys right now, but, as I mentioned in a previous article , Verizon trades at a much bigger discount to its 10-year average valuation. Right now Verizon trades at just 12 times trailing earnings; a 25% discount to its 10-year average of 15.8 times. Verizon yields "just" 5%, which is a bit lower than what AT&T yields, but I think Verizon's steep discount makes it worthwhile. Don't expect too much growth from Verizon. Over the past 10 years Verizon has averaged dividend growth of 3.4% compounded per year, and earnings growth has been roughly the same. I expect these trends to continue. Enterprise Products Partners is my next choice. This pipeline MLP is likely the most conservative in its industry, and that's exactly why I am choosing it right here. Like most pipelines, Enterprise has not yet been too effected by the bear market in crude oil. This is because Enterprise has mostly long-term, take-or-pay contracts with producer customers. Also, 52% of Enterprise's EBITDA comes from the movement and processing of natural gas liquids. Recent discoveries have made America the cheapest producer of NGLs. A boom in both chemicals and NGL exports is underway as a result. While contract renegotiation in the future may not be easy, it's important to remember that pipelines are by far the most cost-effective way of transporting liquids, and pipeline space is quite limited industrywide. Therefore, we have every reason to expect that demand will remain strong. When asked at the latest earnings call about future distributable cash flow, management said, "hell no, we're going to grow it." Given management's unassailable track record in growing distributions, I have confidence in that pledge. Like most pipelines, units of Enterprise have been walloped by the bear market in crude oil. Despite a distribution coverage ratio of 1.45 times over the last 12 months. Enterprise now yields 5.7%, I continue to be very confident in the long-term sustainability of that distribution. My fourth and final pick is the largest bank in Canada, Royal Bank of Canada. Canada's banking and financial system is usually recognized as the safest in the world, and for good reason: This is a heavily-regulated sector with strong capital ratios and strict mortgage requirements that favor the lender. Not only that, Canada also has the lowest government debt-to-GDP ratio of the G8 countries. US shares of Royal have averaged dividend growth of 7.3%, compounded, since 2009. Royal has raised its dividend each year since 2009, when dividend growth was briefly interrupted by the great recession. This company is a great dividend payer, and it will continue to be. Royal also yields 4.4% right now. Regarding valuation, over the last 10 years, Royal has averaged a P/E ratio of 12.5 times trailing earnings, but right now Royal trades at just 10.7 times; a discount of 14%. However, Royal is at a discount for good reason: The Canadian economy officially entered a recession a couple weeks ago, and the energy-dependent western provinces are expected to get hit the hardest as a result. The Canadian dollar has dropped significantly. Even so, I think the Canadian economy will weather through this because the eastern provinces are heavy in export manufacturing, which benefits greatly from a lower currency. Not to mention, lower gasoline and heating oil expenses will mean a boost to consumers and wage-earners. Canada is a diversified economy. And remember, Canada's well-regulated financial system will prevent the calamities seen in the US in 2008. The S&P 500 has pulled back some 8%-10% over the last few weeks. This has uncovered a lot of value in places where there previously wasn't any. I believe these four names are a good place to start, but they certainly aren't the only names out there. The purpose of this article was to highlight low-risk, dividend paying names with a backdrop of sector diversification, which is understood to further mitigate risk.
