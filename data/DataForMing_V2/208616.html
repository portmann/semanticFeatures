Intel Aims To Enter Future iPhones And iPads - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel reportedly has 1,000 people working on iPhone solutions. That's too many for only modem design - they could be working on Apple A1n too. Powering all iPads and iPhones would translate into roughly $15 billion of revenues. Intel's 14nm and 10nm look to be a lot more dense than the competitors' FinFET production and Apple knows that. If Intel could win modem production (and eventually SoC), it will be able to exploit the Apple exposure to attract more customers. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) has always had problems entering the smartphone market. It will probably achieve good results with its SoFIA offering in the low-end and mid-end market, but for the high-end market it will have to wait some more. Recent news makes me think that Intel could enter the high-end smartphone market as a producer of modems and application processors. A source stated that Intel reportedly has 1,000 people working on the next iPhone LTE modem, which could replace the Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM ) one. This product would be built with a 14nm technology node directly in Intel's foundries, and it would generate more than $5 billion per year in revenues for the smartphone sector. Intel's advantage consists of the fact that its 14nm process is considered to be cleaner and product efficient. In addition it obtains smaller sizes - pitch gate, length gate and so on - providing higher density and lower power consumption (take a look here for 14nm and 10nm effective specs). There was a similar rumor last year, but it concerned only the possibility of Intel using its modems directly inside iPhones without any kind of specific info. The rumor looks quite strong, and it seems that Intel is using massive human resources to meet Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) expectations. If Intel is able to win the modem design for the next few years, I would not be surprised to see Intel's modems even in future iPads. It's true that the tablet business is plunging, but it would be an additional good revenue source and it would help Intel grow its brand even in the smartphone and tablet market. Since Intel is using massive human resources, it probably means that the Santa Clara company strongly believes in this project and sees it as a good business. I agree with this opinion. Given that Intel may have 1,000 people working on iPhone solutions, it's hard to think that they are all focused only on modem development. What about SoC development? It's clear that the Intel 14nm foundries are good. Given the recent problems from Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (OTC: SSNLF ) foundries (but I have some doubts, since the latest Tom's Hardware article shows how the Samsung SoC provides lower power consumption, not higher), Intel could partially substitute the Korean company to produce the Apple A1n SoCs. Apple generally prefers to have multiple suppliers for those components that are likely to have lower production yields, so I would expect Intel to join TSMC in Apple A1n production for the first time. Since Intel has very good foundries, it could even completely substitute competitors in Apple SoC production in the future, if it can -provide sufficient guarantees. The same source states that Apple is evaluating the chance of directly requesting an LTE modem integrated into the Apple A1n SoC. That arrangement would obviously improve efficiency and power consumption while lowering the motherboard complexity. At the same time it has a specific drawback on heat generation: when the integrated modem works, it produces consistent heat even at 14nm, and it would force the SoC to slow down to meet TDP specifications. From that point of view, it could be problematic, and I'm not sure that Apple would follow such a route. This is the most interesting aspect. If Intel wins the modem design/production and the SoC production, things would become more interesting from the point of view of the SoC design: Apple A9 SoC costs between $30-$35 to Apple itself, which is a normal price for top-end SoCs. It means that if Intel produces the Apple A1n, it will not be able to charge higher prices. The same would happen even if Intel joins Apple in R&D for a future mobile x86 processor or a top-end Atom SoC. On the contrary, Apple could lower R&D costs and exploit the entire Intel platform synergy. It's obvious that such a scenario would happen only if Intel can provide a very competitive SoC design in terms of performance, power consumption and costs. Such a scenario would bring a possible convergence of OSx and iOS operative systems and/or related programs. It's true that Tim Cook said he does not want to merge the two operating systems, but it does not mean that they cannot use a similar architecture if performance is suitable enough. Intel is working hard in the mobile field. Achieving modems and SoCs sales in Apple iPhones and iPads would bring strong revenues, possibly around $15 billion per year, which would be a massive improvement for Intel in the mobile business. At the same time, Intel would enjoy very good media exposure through Apple, attracting more mobile customers since Intel is building up a whole offering from low-end to high-end areas in the smartphone market. Such a scenario would push Intel's stock price to higher values, and it would eliminate Intel's burden of being unsuccessful in the smartphone field. In my opinion, Intel has good chances of becoming an important player in the mobile market - it's probably only a matter of time. Competitors such as Qualcomm and Samsung should worry a lot if Intel wins modem production for iPhone and iPad: it would be the ultimate spark of a radical change.
