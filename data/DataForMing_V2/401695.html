Nasdaq 100 Is In The Bargain Bin - PowerShares QQQ Trust ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ) | Seeking Alpha â€œSell in May and stay awayâ€? might sound good, but we believe the Nasdaq 100 is a bargain that investors shouldnâ€™t be kept away from. The big three shares in the index have taken a beating, but we see them turning around now. Apple will be supported by a large buyback program that should stop it drifting lower at the very least. At this price, though, we think investor buying will resume. On April 13 we wrote about closing our position in the Nasdaq 100 via the PowerShares QQQ Trust ETF (NASDAQ: QQQ ) due to having suspicions that the current earnings season was going to be largely underwhelming and fearing the market wouldn't react positively. Well, it certainly proved to be the case, as reality fell short of expectations -- and, with it, share prices also. As you can see on the chart shown below, the index and ETF tracking in have been on a steady decline since. We definitely dodged a bullet with that one. We have been toying with re-entering for a little while now, but it just didn't feel right. But today, we feel different. Sure, it is the month May and we have that wonderful "sell in May and stay away" mantra floating around the market, but after an almost 6 percent decline, today looks to be the day. There was of course a spanner in the works in the form of the non-farm payroll release today. The result seems to have all but ruled out the Fed being remotely interested in raising rates in June now, and the index at the time of writing was down. But if the market stays down today then we're still happy to buy in, as we see great gains ahead for the index. Now some may say this still isn't the time to get in on the Nasdaq and that we are too early with more declines still on the cards. This is a more than reasonable assumption, after all the Hulbert Nasdaq Newsletter Sentiment Index is pointing to further declines ahead and currently stands at negative 26.7 percent. This index is a barometer of sentiment on the Nasdaq. At negative 26.7 percent the index reveals that the average Nasdaq market timer is currently allocating over a quarter of his portfolio to a bet on the market declining. As you can see above, there is a reasonably strong correlation between the index and the HNNSI. Since the start of the year both have rallied strongly, with the HNNSI having been at the 70 percent level around a month ago. This has constituted quite a change in sentiment, it has to be said. But one thing we would point to is the tendency it has to exaggerate the declines. We believe it may have bottomed now, and that it is about to start to retrace higher. As you can see above, the top 10 holdings have a weighting of 53.42 percent. We would argue that the top three holdings are perhaps the biggest drivers with their approximate weighting of 29.5 percent. With a weighting of almost a third it is no wonder the Nasdaq 100 was dragged down with the post-earnings performance of its big-three constituents. As you can see below, disappointing earnings releases have dragged these three shares down greatly, especially Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). But we feel that the sell-off is overdone now and expect to see these three shares get picked up by bargain hunters. You can only keep high-quality companies like these down so long. With Apple down almost 17 percent since we exited the QQQ ETF, it is looking like a great investment today. There is a lot of talk about peak-iPhone and slowing sales of a lot of its core products, but we expect things will pick up. We personally are waiting eagerly for the next iPhone, as are many, we are sure. It is also reasonable to presume there is something more to come from Cupertino as well. Apple rarely sits still for long. Finally, let's not forget the buyback program it has planned . We doubt very much that the share price will drift any lower, considering the buying that is expected to take place. Right now, at this current price, we would imagine Apple will be quite busy buying back its own stock. We see the Nasdaq 100 climbing in the manner shown above. This should present investors with a return in the region of 9 percent through to September, ceteris paribus. What the Federal Reserve decides to do between then and now could either enhance or hinder its progress, but we do see this as the higher probability result. Investors can get exposure to the Nasdaq 100 by investing in the top ten holdings listed earlier, or by investing in the QQQ ETF that tracks the index. If you are even more bullish than we are, know that the ProShares UltraPro QQQ ETF (NASDAQ: TQQQ ) provides investors 3x leverage on the Nasdaq 100 performance. Please note that 3x the gains also means 3x the losses. So handle with care!
