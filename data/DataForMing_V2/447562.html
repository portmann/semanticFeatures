Spotify accuses Apple of anti-competitive behavior - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Jun 30 2016, 15:08 ET | About: Apple Inc. (AAPL) | By: Stephen Alpher , SA News Editor Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is "causing grave harm to Spotify (Private: MUSIC ) and its customers," by rejecting an update to Spotify's iOS app, goes a letter sent by Spotify's general counsel to Apple's top lawyer, reports Re/Code . The letter suggests the streaming service intends to use the issue in its fight over Apple's rules governing subscription services using its App store, and copies of it went to - among others - Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who yesterday said, "Apple has long used its control of iOS to squash competition in music." Spotify has used Apple's billing system for years, passing along the 30% charge to customers (who pay $13 per month instead of the $10 charged outside of Apple's store). Since Apple launched its own music service, Spotify has been more vocal about encouraging customers to pay outside of iTunes - something which hasn't pleased Apple. Spotify, this month, revived a campaign offering new subscribers three months for $0.99 if they signed up on the company site. Spotify's lawyer says Apple threatened to remove the app from its store unless the company stopped telling iPhone users about the deal. Wow, Spotify is starting to feel the pressure. This is a very positive sign for AAPL. To think about those trolls claiming Apple Music would have zero chances against Spotify... positive sign? Spotify is way better than Apple Music are you kidding. Apple is red handed here. I can't wait for Senator Warren to flex some muscle. She just mentioned how competition is too much and then turns around to see Apple being a bully. Where are my Apple Bears?!?!? Time to playyyyyyy e ayyyyyy I've tried spotify, apple music, tidal and google play. Apple music is by FAR the worst! The only reason anyone uses it is because they don't know about the competition. Not a surprise, they can't innovate so they have to bully the small guy. Similar issues can equate to IP trolling with patenting curved corners and threatening litigation or bankrupcy like Peter Thiel with Gawker. Or even the GTAT deal that made them go out of business or the music industry with downloadable content or Sprint deal to sign nondisclosure agreement guaranteeing 17m iphonys. I guess I don't see how this is bullying. Spotify agreed to pay 30% to Apple to use in app purchases. Spotify decided to screw customers by charging more to people signing up from within the App Store, again a Spotify choice not Apple. Now that competition is present Spotify is luring customers away from the App Store which is clearly against the terms of the App Store. I don't get it? Spotify had an agreement for billing using Applepay for years; now they want to cut apple out and claim apple is trying to screw them? Shouldn't they just terminate the agreement totally then or are they still benefitting from it. Apple is a Shark with all their bait fish proles out bringing in the Big Haul of Con Game Dollars!  ......like all snake oil selling gypsy circus or wagon Con Artists!
