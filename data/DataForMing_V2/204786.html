ETF Hub Oct 15 2015, 09:54 ET | About: Facebook (FB) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor Argus Research's Joseph Bonner has upgraded Facebook ( FB +1.7%) to Buy, and set a $115 target. Echoing arguments familiar to many sell-side firms, Bonner cites Facebook's high mobile adoption rates, mobile ad monetization, and the potential of Messenger and Oculus. He also argues Facebook's Shopping page (currently being tested) will be well-received by advertisers and provide the company with more data about its users' shopping habits. Shares are back above $95, and go for 35x a 2016 EPS consensus of $2.75. Q3 results arrive on Nov. 4. Separately, in a recent Wired interview , Messenger chief David Marcus talks up Facebook's efforts to turn Messenger into an alternative to e-mail for interactions between businesses and customers (with the help of the M personal assistant ), as well as to provide "a frictionless payment experience" and monetize e-commerce via ads. Marcus: "eBay takes a cut of every transaction and listing; Alibaba does all that for free, and makes money from advertising. Alibaba is bigger than eBay and Amazon combined, and is growing much faster. We take the same approach .. Businesses will want to pay to be featured or promoted - which is a bigger opportunity for us."
