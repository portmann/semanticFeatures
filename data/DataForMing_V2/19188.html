'Home' The Short-Term Story For Dreamworks, Consumer Products And Television Long-Term Bets - Dreamworks Animation SKG Inc (NASDAQ:DWA) | Seeking Alpha "Home" outperformed estimates and provides a short-term boost to Dreamworks Animation as the only 2015 release. Television revenue set to hit $200 to $250 million in 2015 led by new shows on Netflix. Dreamworks Animation signs new deal with Verizon for 200 hours of original content, strengthening television segment and diversifying importance of Netflix. Consumer products and increasing storyline to watch with new television launches on Netflix in 2015 and new Kung Fu Panda and Trolls movies in 2016. Shares of Dreamworks Animation (NASDAQ: DWA ) have had an up and down several years. The company continues to struggle as its recent box office releases have been duds and led to several major writedowns. This also comes at a time when shares rise and fall from acquisition rumors. The good news for shareholders and potential shareholders is the diversification of the company's business into television and consumer products continues to accelerate and should reward patient long-term investors. The recent surprise success of "Home," now in theaters, could also provide a short term boost as well. Back in the middle of March, Dreamworks Animation announced a new content deal with Verizon, which I believe strengthens my past arguments of the importance of television for the company going forward. Under the terms of the deal, Verizon will add 200 hours of original video to target teens and millennials. The content will include scripted and unscripted programming. AwesomenessTV is one of the key pieces to the puzzle and likely a big reason why Dreamworks Animation received this content deal for Verizon's upcoming video service. Dreamworks Animation acquired AwesomenessTV back in 2013. AwesomenessTV now has more than 7 billion views and 112 million subscribers. AwesomenessTV has helped create content for Dreamworks Animation like Tomboy the movie and "Richie Rich," which is part of the Netflix deal. On the conference call it was said that DreamworksTV, with its boost from the AwesomenessTV family, is the number one family channel on YouTube and has growth exceeding Disney Channel, Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network. AwesomenessTV is not the only part of Dreamworks involved as some of its most recognizable characters will be used in the multi-year deal. This is similar to the strategy used by Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ), which utilizes newer Dreamworks Animation characters and also use some of the characters Dreamworks owns through its Classic Media acquisition (Richie Rich in the case of Netflix). This deal with Verizon is a big one that should not be ignored. One of the biggest reasons the Verizon deal is important is not only its diversification of the company's revenue but the diversification within its television section. An analyst at BTIG argued on the last conference call that Dreamworks Animation was too dependent on Netflix for revenue. This turned out to be partially true in a later follow-up from the company. Netflix represented 15% of Dreamworks Animation's 2014 revenue ($102 million). With several shows still to hit the streaming service, Netflix could very well make up a larger portion of the company's revenue in 2015. The Verizon deal now helps to boost the overall revenue impact of the television segment and also lower the dependency on Netflix. Now the Netflix deal is still obviously important to Dreamworks Animation in its diversification attempts. The deal goes through 2017 with some episodes still being delivered until the year 2019. In the fourth quarter, Dreamworks delivered 40 episodes to Netflix across four television show titles ("Turbo F.A.S.T", "VeggieTales", "All Hail King Julien," and "Puss in Boots"). In 2015, Dreamworks will deliver season 2 of these shows and also seven new titles as part of its existing deal. The other big television news I wrote about prior was Dreamworks Animation launching a television channel ( read more here ) in Asia later this year. That channel will air in 19 countries and provide a great point of entry for Dreamworks Animation for several of its characters, which in return could boost consumer products sales and also box office revenue in the region. On the fourth quarter conference call , Dreamworks provided some details of this new channel. The Chinese channel will be launched in the second half of the year, with HBO Asia managing affiliate and advertising seals. There will be over 3,000 hours of content for the channel. Prior to the Verizon deal announcement, Dreamworks Animation said it was on track for 2015 television revenue to be $200 to $250 million with a gross margin of 30%. This is a sizable number for the company since last year's entire revenue was $685 million. In the fourth quarter, television revenue was $51 million. In fact in the fourth quarter, television represented $51 million of $234 million the company reported. Moving on from television, consumer products are the other big reason I am bullish on Dreamworks Animation for the long term. On the latest conference call it was said that "We can see that our investment has begun to bear fruit" when discussing consumer products. In 2014, consumer product revenue was up 28%. Dreamworks Animation was a top ten toy licensor thanks to the success of How to Train Your Dragon, which also represented 23% of fourth quarter consumer product revenue. Going forward, Dreamworks Animation is very bullish on its consumer product lineup. In 2016, the company will have two theatrical releases in "Kung Fu Panda 3" and "Trolls." Kung Fu Panda has generated strong returns before for the company and with the growing presence of the brand in China, consumer product sales should see a large increase. The theatrical release of Trolls I, highlighted in a prior article, is something the company continues to believe is one of the most important launches related to its consumer products segment. From the conference call, "Trolls is probably going to be the greatest opportunity that we have had of any movie since we started the company." That's coming from a company that has the Shrek, Kung Fu Panda and How to Train Your Dragon brands, so Trolls is clearly a potential catalyst to the company and its shares. The entry into television and several new brands also bode well for consumer products. Dreamworks Animation highlighted "Voltron," "VeggieTales" and "Dinotrux" as strong brands it believes in for the future. VeggieTales has been around for years and recently got a re-launch on Netflix. Voltron and Dinotrux will get a Netflix launch in 2015 and will see strong toy launches around the brands. The consumer product segment had revenue of $22 million in the fourth quarter. Reports show "Home" outperformed estimates and grossed $52 million in its opening weekend. This comes as welcomed good news for Dreamworks Animation as it represents a higher open than its last couple releases and also put the company in better financial shape from its only 2015 theatrical release. Amazingly enough, the"Home" opening weekend is ahead of "How to Train Your Dragon 2" and also its highest opening The bad news is "Home" is the only theatrical release for 2015. The good news is one of the most important and biggest potential movies will be launched in 2016. "Kung Fu Panda 3" is one of the highest anticipated movies in Dreamworks' history. The importance of the movie has increased with other Chinese studios behind the financing. I wrote about the importance of "Kung Fu Panda" in a prior article. "Trolls" also is highly anticipated by the company and should see strong interest with toy launches around the theatrical release. Without getting too far ahead of the game, keep in mind that a significant milestone is coming in the second or third quarter for the company. Dreamworks Animation will announce its first original production for Oriental Dreamworks, which it holds a 45% ownership stake. The company calls this announcement a, "very, very significant milestone." This movie would be scheduled for a first quarter release in 2018. While that's a long way out, the announcement could highlight the company's investment in China, whose box office is rapidly growing. By being involved in local production, the company has a strong position to continue to see its movies imported into China. Due to a shift in the release schedule, fiscal 2015 is not looking amazing for Dreamworks shareholders. Analysts on Yahoo Finance see the company posting a loss of $0.38 per share for the full year. That comes from revenue of $844.8 million, which would be an increase of 23%. In fiscal 2016, analysts see the company returning to a profit, with $0.73 per share projected. Revenue is estimated to increase 20.9% to $1.02 billion. Shares of Dreamworks Animation actually rose on Friday 3% to end the week at $22.68. A sharp rise on Monday put shares closer to the mid-point of their 5-week range ($18.16 to $28.98). Originally I thought Monday was going to bring a sell off and a great entry point for investors, but the "Home" success has now put shares in rally mode. I think investors should carefully watch this stock throughout the next couple of weeks. The results from "Home" could give the rally legs and lead to an out of reach share price ($25 and above). Anything below $25 is still a bargain in my mind with the coming growth and diversification from consumer products and television.
