The company named Pat Devlin as president of the Northeast Area -- one of four regional units that the company reorganized its sales into -- and named Mariano Legaz the company's chief procurement officer. Devlin was formerly Verizon's New York metro regional president; he'll report directly to CEO Marcelo Claure. Legaz was previously Verizon's Florida regional president. He'll report to CFO Tarek Robbiati. With the move, Sprint has named three of its four area presidents, leaving just the West to fill. Devlin is taking over the Northeast; Jamie Jones was named president of the South; and Kevin Crull president of Central. The company has also named almost all of its regional presidents (reporting into the area structure).
