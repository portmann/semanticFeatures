Memo To Ford's Management: Go On The Offensive And Buy Back $10 Billion Worth Of Your Own Shares - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford Motor has the cash and the free cash flow to go on the offensive when it comes to stock buybacks. A buyback announcement is most certainly a bullish catalyst, and would be a good initiative for Ford's management to breathe life in the company's shares. High cash values per share indicate a potentially inefficient use of shareholder capital. General Motors (NYSE: GM ) is doing the exact right thing for shareholders: Buying back shares and raising its dividend. And it is something Ford Motor's (NYSE: F ) management can learn a lot from. General Motors did need a nudge from hedge funds, though, to return more capital to shareholders, but how the company got there is not in any form diminishing the relevance of its capital return plan. Earlier this month, General Motors announced that it is going to buy back $5 billion worth of its own stock . But that isn't all: The company also guided for a higher quarterly dividend of $0.36 per share, a 20% increase quarter-over-quarter. General Motors was not merely making a point that it is improving shareholder relations by returning more capital to investors. It also brought attention to the fact that U.S. auto manufacturers are drowning in cash, which allows companies like General Motors and Ford Motor to return large amounts of free cash flow to shareholders. I raised this issue last year and pointed out that auto manufacturers have extremely high cash per share values, which affords investors with a wide margin of safety. At the end of 2014, General Motors, for example, reported $19.0 billion in cash/cash equivalents and $9.2 billion in marketable securities, for a total of $28.2 billion, or $16.70 per share, in gross cash. Ford Motor, on the other hand, reported $10.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $20.4 billion in marketable securities on its balance sheet at the end of fiscal 2014. On a per share (diluted) basis, this translates into $7.70 of gross cash. Not bad for a company trading at $16. At the end of 2014, $21.7 billion of Ford's total cash and marketable securities value was tied up in Ford's automotive unit. The chart below from Ford's 10-K SEC filing shows that high cash balances are nothing out of the ordinary for Ford Motor. Ford's management should step up and submit a competitive capital return plan that calls for a substantive stock buyback in the amount of $10 billion. The company has both the cash balance as well as the free cash flow to afford a voluminous stock buyback program. Ford Motor should also take General Motors' balanced capital return framework as an example. General Motors has communicated that it intends to create value for shareholders via three pathways: Ford Motor's management does a lot of good things for shareholders, and the company's dividend yield is competitive at 3.7%. In fact, Ford Motor could be an excellent income vehicle if the auto manufacturer continues to grow its dividend like it did in the past; a 6% cash flow yield could indeed be possible by 2017. But Ford Motor can improve on its buyback policy. Undoubtedly, General Motors is taking the lead here with its $5 billion buyback announcement. According to Ford Motor's recent 10-K filing, the auto manufacturer is not exactly making stock buybacks a priority, besides wanting to offset the negative effects of dilution: In May 2014 we commenced and in August 2014 we completed a repurchase program for approximately 116 million shares of Ford Common Stock, or 3% of diluted shares, at a total cost of about $2 billion. Approximately 12.6 million shares were repurchased to offset the dilutive effect of share-based employee incentive compensation granted in 2014. Approximately 103 million shares were repurchased to offset the dilutive effect of our 4.25% Senior Convertible Notes due November 15, 2016, as well as to offset the increase in outstanding shares that would result from settling conversions with shares. Further, Ford Motor has lost ground to General Motors lately in terms of share performance. A substantive buyback announcement on the part of Ford would most certainly be viewed as a positive catalyst for the company's shares. Ford's management should follow General Motors' example and deploy more cash to the benefit of shareholders. Ford Motor could afford a $10 billion share buyback, which would help its shares regain their mojo. It is no secret among shareholders that Ford Motor is glaringly undervalued. A buyback announcement would be a positive catalyst for shares and would be very welcomed by shareholders. It would be the right thing to do.
