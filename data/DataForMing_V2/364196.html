Gabelli: Verizon pursuing Yahoo makes sense; he'd support - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha Apr  8 2016, 19:20 ET | About: Verizon Communications (VZ) | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Mario Gabelli -- who owns shares of both Verizon ( VZ +0.4%) and Yahoo ( YHOO -0.3%) -- says he'd support a bid by Verizon for Yahoo's core Internet business. "This is pretty simple. It's basically Investment Banking 101," he says of a deal where Verizon takes over Yahoo core assets and works out a deal with Masayoshi Son to sell off Yahoo Japan. "The question is do you want to own Alibaba," Gabelli says -- a company with which he has "some issues" (corporate governance, not fundamentals). The deal can make sense particularly after Verizon took on AOL. "It's $6B -- and they wound up buying a spinoff from Time Warner, it'll fit in nicely with that." Meanwhile, in talking to sources, Re/code's Kara Swisher says Google, Twitter and Facebook are among the suitors unlikely to bid -- the "lookee-loos" of this particular yard sale. Several dozen companies have been named as interested parties, but Swisher says only a handful will be in the running. Google needn't have bothered after organically winning the search war, she writes, and there's little at Yahoo attractive to Facebook. Twitter was more serious, she says, but there's what one source calls a "nearly zero percent change of bidding," for reasons that include a Yahoo integration that would run counter to Twitter's mission to goose growth. So far I am not impressed with go90.  As a Verizon investor I am afraid Verizon is wasting money it could use to pay down debt and acquire spectrum. Hope my pessimism is wrong.  If they would focus as much on quality of these new investments as they do on quality of network, I have reason to hope. You do not need to pay down debt if it is free money. Why VZ should do it? I have an outstanding mortgage rate on my house, and I am in absolutely no rush to pay it down. Jee, I'd rather buy Verizon!! Barron's talking $48, I can't see it happening ,not up at that level,it's nice to see Mario talking his book but give us a break will ya! Gabelli owns VZ and YHOO both, so his opinion need not be predicated solely on what's best for VZ.  He may think a bid will result in a net plus for him and who cares about VZ shareholders? People just need to let Yahoo die in peace. Any proprietary tech they have is either outdated or easily substituted. Its been a long time since they've been able to attract the best talent. At present their customer interface is at least 3 generations behind the state of the industry. So why even. People just need to let Yahoo die in peace.
