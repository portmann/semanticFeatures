Microsoft puts AI at center of tech plans - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Mar 31 2016, 04:08 ET | About: Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) has outlined plans to put an array of chatbots, intelligent agents and digital assistants at the center of its future technology. "Bots are the new apps. Digital assistants are like...the new browsers, and intelligence is infused into all your interactions," CEO Satya Nadella said at the company's annual Build conference in San Francisco.
