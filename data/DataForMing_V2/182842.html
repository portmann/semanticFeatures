Dell Picks Intel For Its Anti-iPad Pro Venue 10 Pro Tablet - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Dell is using the 14nm Intel Atom x5 SoC for its latest enterprise-centric Venue 2-in-1 tablet notebooks. The new $429 Dell Venue 10 Pro is more attractive than the $799 iPad Pro. Dell, which previously signed up to sell/distribute Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Surface tablet/notebook products, announced that it is coming up with a new line of Windows 10 Venue tablet/notebook products. The new Venue 10 Pro 5000 Series is a $429 enterprise-centric tablet that uses Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) latest 14nm Atom x5-Z8500 SoC. Dell is obviously positioning this one as a cheaper alternative to the $799 Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPad Pro and Surface Pro 3 . While it has agreed to sell the high-end Surface Pro 3 to its corporate customers, Dell is not abandoning its Venue tablet business. Microsoft already offers the budget-friendly Surface 3 for $499 . However, Dell is likely intent on selling its own Windows 10 tablet so it could sign up more customers for its commercial enterprise software products like Client Command Suite . While Dell will get a commission for every Surface Pro 3 it sells, the potential income from selling its own hardware (plus the sales from its software) is too important to ignore. I opine that Microsoft is unlikely to package Dell's commercial enterprise software inside its own Surface Pro 3. Whatever the reason is for Dell's decision to not go exclusive on Surface Pro 3, Intel still benefits from this major OEM's continuing loyalty. The enterprise campaign of the iPad Pro is now facing another hurdle. Aside from the Surface Pro 3, the iPad Pro now has a potent rival in the much affordable Dell Venue 10 Pro. The $25/tray price of the Atom x5-Z8500 belies its decent computing power. It's an advanced 64-bit processor that touts 2W of Scenario Design Power (SDP) of energy efficiency, and yet it can still run any x86 industry-standard or custom software. This is something that the ARM-based iPad Pro can never match in terms of universal usability. The 3400++ multi-core GeekBench scores of this cheap Intel laptop CPU is high enough to decently run Office 2013, Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE ) Photoshop CC, and AutoCAD 2015. I think the current scenario is that majority of companies rely too much on their existing custom-made x86 software for them to risk it all on the iPad Pro. The cheaper Dell Venue 10 Pro is more useful to companies which are not willing to spend more money just to port (or virtualize) their x86 software to run on ARM-based tablets/laptops. Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ), Hewlett Packard (NYSE: HPQ ), and other higher-margin Android device makers are also using the x5-Z8500. The more CPU/RAM-efficient Windows 10 OS should give the x5-Z8500 of the Dell Venue 10 Pro a better real-world performance. Dell also equipped the $429 model of the Dell Venue 10 Pro with 4GB of DDR3 RAM. This should make multi-tasking a comfortable experience for office/road workaholics. Unlike the iPad Pro, the cheapest model of the Dell Venue 10 Pro also has a microSD slot which supports up to 128GB cards. As for battery life, Dell's latest enterprise tablet will allegedly last for 9.5 hours. Like the Surface Pro 3, the Dell Venue 10 Pro also has a stylus. However, Dell opted to use Wacom ( OTCPK:WACMY ) solutions for its digitizer pen, rather than the N-trig technology of the Surface Pen. Enterprise IT managers may also fall for the pre-installed security measures on the Dell Venue 10 Pro. Dell will pre-install its Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 and Dell Data Protection/Encryption on its $429 enterprise tablet. The smaller $299 Dell Venue 8 Pro could also become a serious rival to the $399 iPad Mini 4. I opine that smaller 8-inch tablets with stylus remain attractive to office users who don't like the 2-in-1, keyboard-equipped tablet concept. The one-hand-operation-friendly Dell Venue 8 Pro also has the same Intel x5-Z8500 SoC. It therefore has the same computing power and usability of its more expensive, bigger sibling. It is good that Intel's mobile chips are getting more design wins from leading PC manufacturers. Higher margins on enterprise-centric tablets mean Intel doesn't have to do any contra-revenue on Dell/Microsoft tablets. Intel is all about hardware profits. Unlike Microsoft, which can monetize buyers of its sub-$100 Windows 10 phones via ads and Office 365 subscriptions, Intel doesn't have any other viable way to make money except from processor sales. I believe that focusing more on higher-margin tablets is more important than Intel meeting its annual sales target for tablet application processors. While Intel indeed beat its 40 million sales target for tablet application processors last year, it also cost the company 9-figure operating losses. Dell's loyalty to the Intel brand is a solid tailwind for Intel. The more companies that realize x86 processors are still best for enterprise usage, the better it is for Intel. My premium account at I Know First Research told me its algorithm forecast only has a Neutral rating for the 12-month future of INTC. However, I still say INTC is a Buy . Intel's stock is valued below its competitors. This is in spite of the fact that it has no real rival anymore in the lucrative x86 desktop/server processor market. As long as Dell, Lenovo ( OTCPK:LNVGY ), HP, Asus, Acer, and other PC vendors ignore ARM-based processors for their high-end PC/server products, Intel remains a long-term winner for me.
