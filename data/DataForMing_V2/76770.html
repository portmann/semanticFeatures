Apple: iOS 9 Improvement Key To WWDC Success - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha 2014 was about a larger iPhone screen, this year it is about the software. Battery life improvement and operating system stability are key. Next week, we'll hear from technology giant Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) at its annual WorldWide Developers Conference ("WWDC"). This event will showcase features for both current and future devices, and I'm most curious to hear about iOS 9. Since the iPhone dominates Apple's revenues and profits, I believe there are a few key items regarding the new operating system that will determine WWDC's success. When it comes to the iPhone, I want to hear about iOS 9 delivering more stability and less bugs, an item many are looking for . Last year's version of the operating system forced Apple to come out with multiple updates. Two items I heard the most concerns about were battery drain and operating system size (especially for those with the 16 GB version). One article I read earlier this year discusses how it might be time for Apple to prioritize battery life over the thinness of the phone. I definitely believe that storage size is one area that can be worked on. Apple may try to reduce the installation size of the operating system, since iOS needed 2+ GB. This is an item that has been cited for iOS 8's slower adoption rate than iOS 7. The alternative here would be for Apple to launch devices with larger storage. Since Apple gets higher selling prices for the higher storage models, this would be a way to upsell the new phones. On page 26 of its most recently filed 10-Q , Apple detailed a larger mix of higher storage capacity phones as a reason for the large improvement in phone selling prices. Perhaps Apple can keep a lower end phone with just 16 GB of storage, using the size of the iPhone 5, but keep the larger screen models with a base storage of 32GB. This would work perfectly in a three-model situation . The iPhone has shown tremendous sales growth since fiscal 2007, as seen in the chart below. In the first half of fiscal 2015, Apple sold over 135.6 million iPhones, an increase of nearly 41 million. The company will most likely sell more iPhones in its first three fiscal quarters of 2015 than it did in all of fiscal 2014. (Source: Apple annual 10-K filings ) Improving the items I discussed above are key to this year's launch because there is a sizable upgrade base currently. Not only do you have the 5C/5S launch holders ready to go to a larger screen, but we are approaching the two-year anniversary of Apple selling the iPhone through China Mobile (NYSE: CHL ). That comes in early 2016, so those phone users looking for a new phone will be looking at this year's launch. Perhaps its most important market currently, Apple needs to satisfy Chinese consumers if it wants to rival Samsung (OTC: SSNLF ) and march its way towards 300 million iPhone sales per year. Apple shares have a history of pulling back during WWDC. An article that examined the issue a few years ago detailed how the company faces high expectations going into the event. In 2012, expectations called for three major new products to be launched at WWDC, and none were. With many new Apple rumors each week, investors get upset when the company doesn't launch something. The table below shows performance during the week of WWDC. I believe last year was an outlier due to the stock split, which came the following week. (Source: history of WWDC plus Apple public relations page ) WWDC is next week, and I'll be looking to hear what Apple has to say about iOS 9. Does the company address items like operating system size and battery drain? Last year's iPhone launch was about a larger screen, but this year needs to be about better software. With analyst estimates rising to new highs and above Apple's guidance, the company needs another big iPhone performance. The annual pullback during this year's event would provide a decent opportunity to enter Apple shares. Right now, they are close to a key support level at the 50-day moving average, seen below.
