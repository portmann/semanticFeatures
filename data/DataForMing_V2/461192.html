10 Everyday Ways To Save Money | See Debt Run Posted  by stefanie in Saving Money | 51 comments Stefanie is a staff writer here at See Debt Run, and also writes on her own site “ The Broke and Beautiful Life “. Hello “See Debt Run?? readers!  I wanted to take this opportunity to introduce myself by sharing some of my day to day strategies for saving money.  Some of these you’ve probably heard before, others may be new, some you may be doing already, and others might not be for you. If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that personal finance is truly “personal??.  We’ve all got different ways of prioritizing and shaping our financial future.  My goal here will be to give you a variety of options and tools to consider so you can pick and choose which strategies work best for you. And with that, let’s get started with my 10 everyday ways to save money. 1.    Stock Up on Socks and Underwear.  Spending time and money going to the Laundromat is something I like to avoid as much as possible.  To make my wardrobe stretch, I re-wear staples like jeans and jackets and stock up on the items I need to change every day like socks and underwear.  With a full drawer dedicated to these every day essentials, I only have to do my laundry once a month.  2.    Cut back on primping.  I work in the entertainment industry so I appreciate the importance of appearance, but I am not willing to drop over $100 every four to six weeks to get my hair trimmed and my roots done.  Simple techniques like waiting an additional few weeks between haircuts or painting your own nails can save you hundreds every year.  3.    Learn.  Everything I know about saving and making money I learned at some point from somewhere.  Continuing to read and stay tuned in to the latest information is critical.  If you know the fair price of an item, you won’t allow yourself to be scammed.  If you understand how to use your credit card effectively you can wind up getting cash back rather than paying interest.  If you learn how to invest wisely, you can grow your money rather than losing it to inflation.  4.    No pets.  I can barely afford to pay my own rent, buy my own food, and purchase my own healthcare let alone provide all that for an animal.   I also never want to be faced with the decision of splurging to treat a pet’s unexpected medical condition or letting it die.  5.    Netflix.  A 3-D movie in New York City can cost $18!  The “regular?? price is still somewhere around $12.  I’ll trade three movie nights for a chance to go see a Broadway show instead.  In the meantime, I’m a Netflix junkie.  At $7.99 a month, with all the amazing new series’, and instant accessibility, I’m happy to stay in.  6.    Use Your Freebies. I always do my best to utilize freebies and items built into the price of a purchase.   For instance, when I stay at a hotel, I’ll pack up the complimentary shampoos and conditioners each night so I get new ones when they clean the room in the morning.  Now I have a stockpile of practically new travel sized soaps for future camping trips and family visits.  7.    No processed foods.  I don’t care to spend my hard earned money on the long-term health consequences of a poor diet. 8.    Run.  A membership to New York Sports Club costs $80/month.  I’d much rather enjoy a long run in the sun along the Hudson River than stare at a screen on the treadmill.  Plus it’s free and my running comes with me wherever I go!  9.    Bike.  While I enjoy running for fitness, I’ve taken to biking for transportation.  In the past 6 months, I’ve saved over $600 by not having to buy a monthly metro card or drive a car.  10.  Pick and choose.  More than anything, I believe in moderation.  I don’t want to deprive myself of the occasional Starbucks and dinners out just to save a couple of bucks here and there.  Maybe you don’t want to deprive yourself of having a pet or going to the movies.  Like I said, it’s personal.    The important thing is to recognize those indulgences for what they are and make sure they don’t become regular occurrences that interfere with your ability to create a secure financial future. Running and biking are great alternatives to the gym – I also play team sports, so between all there there is no need/time for the gym! Yes!  I love when workouts don’t feel like workouts!  With all that physical activity, you definitely don’t need a gym! Hi Stefanie, Congrats on your new gig.  I’m with you on the netflix.  Now a days it seems movies are out on DVD so quickly so why pay so much money to go see them on the big screen. Thanks so much, I’m psyched to be here! Choosing netflix over the theatre also makes you less likely to splurge on marked up munchies.  Plus I can watch in my PJ’s at home ? Kurt @ Money Counselor - November 6, 2013 Excellent! I particularly endorse ‘no processed foods.’ Diet is not the place to focus first when looking to cut expenses. As you say, you’d pay in the long run, both in terms of quality and quantity of life! Diet is something that unfortunately gets overlooked too often when it comes to savings.  People will pay a fortune for the latest cleanse or workout craze rather than just regularly eating quality fruits and veggies. Kendal @HassleFreeSaver - November 6, 2013 Great list! I’m definitely on board with Netflix, no processed foods and free outdoor exercise. I would add using coupons for retail purchases (grocery store purchases too, but I’m not a big coupon clipper). I make this easy with a coupon app on my smartphone so I have them with me at all times! I’m so bad with coupons.  When I purchase something online I’ll always check for promo codes, but when I go to the store, I can never seem to get it together.  What apps do you recommend? Thanks for including a blurb about products with preservatives. It’s the first time I’ve seen in mentioned as a savings topic.   All great advice! DC @ Young Adult Money - November 6, 2013 I could never do the whole no pets tip, but I definitely agree that not having pets will save you money.  They can be super expensive, especially if they get sick or hurt. I understand why people are willing to splurge on a pet, I’m just not one of those people.  Maybe someday. Great post! I want a cat SO BAD, but I know it’s not good for my finances and I’d be a bad pet parent. So I will wait until I’m debt free. Jack @ Enwealthen - November 6, 2013 Good point about the pets.  Not just the costs of high quality food, having to make that decision on $5K for cancer treatments or letting a member of the family go is terrible. That said, people with cats or dogs are happier on average that the pet-free.  So if you compare the TCO of a pet vs. 10 years of anti-depressants, suddenly it’s not so cut and dried.  ? You make a good point Jack.  I think running is my personal anti-depressant, but that too carries it’s own set of expenses. Budget and the Beach - November 6, 2013 I swear netflix is the best. a lifesaver! I stay home so much that I get so much entertainment from it! Hulu as well. Netflix and hulu are incredible.  I hear amazon is pretty good too.  They’re launching some original series’ too like netflix. Great tips! Movie prices around here are $12-$14, which I think is ridiculous. I haven’t been since much earlier this year, but I always go when it’s half off. Luckily our rent includes cable and we have a decent amount of movie channels. I also love renting shows from the library. Your freebies one reminds me of my grandma. She gets comped rooms when she stays in AC and never fails to take a bunch of stuff home to give to everyone. I was just talking with Michelle the other day about how I couldn’t remember the last time I went to the theater to see a movie. To me, it just isn’t worth the high cost. We don’t have Netflix, but we do have Amazon Prime which offers a very similar service. My favorite item on your list is #3. I always tell my kids this on the weekends when they are looking for something to do. “Go Out and Learn Something! Feed Your Brain!” ? Great post. I’ve got to learn to run outside year round and save on my gym membership. It’s just so cold in the winter! I layer up in the winter.  Tank  top, long sleeved shirt, and two fleeces.  It feels nice to get some fresh air in those winter months too! I’m just now doing the whole no processed food thing. It’s working out for me so far. I live in a house with other people so by buying raw foods I find that the people I live with are too lazy to cook so in the end I end up saving money. It’s amazing how much your perspective can make a difference.  I find raw foods to be the EASIEST.  If I’m too lazy to cook them, I’ll just eat them raw- salad, fruits, veggies.  So yummy. So healthy. I love the tip of using diet to mitigate long term health costs. It’s like our bodies are lifelong savings accounts…you get out of them what you invest over time. Deacon @ Well Kept Wallet - November 7, 2013 Netflix is a huge savings over having cable. I can’t tell you how many TV shows we watched on Netflix from start to finish. Great list! I’m somewhat obsessed with “Orange is the New Black” and “House of Cards”, so psyched to see what else Netflix has in store for us! Jennifer @ Budgeting in Baby - November 7, 2013 Not having a pet as a way to save is definitely a lesson I learned the hard way. My parents have a dog and when I moved out on my own I was really lonely. I got a dog and then I fell on hard times and wasn’t sure how I was going to take care of him. I had to find him a new home. It made the adoption fee seem like a waste of money. Unfortunately, frequent laundry is unavoidable at our house. Due to some medical conditions, my husband refuses to reuse towels or wear the same jeans more than once. So he runs through his stock pretty quickly. Not much to be done about that, I suppose. I, on the other hand, work from home, so my going-out-into-the-world wardrobe lasts MUCH longer. I guess we even out. We love Netflix, though we have the option with DVDs. And we just went to Hulu to cut our cable bill. And at holidays/birthdays, we get GCs to movie theaters. So we get by with a pretty lean entertainment budget, at least. Sounds like you have some well rounded entertainment.  I hear Amazon is also getting in on the Netflix/Hulu subscription television biz. Really great ideas. There are so many things we can do to save money and, once we start this, it’s amazing to see how much we can actually save. I agree with all of the above, although I do have a pet cat, but she’s easy on the pocketbook! One way I save money, and we have “talked” about this before, is that I am single and happily so! Therefore I don’t spend money out on dates or couple stuff. When I talk to my friends who are on the dating scene I can’t believe how much they spend on dinner, movies, drinks and little gifts for each other. It’s nice and all, but whoa is it ever expensive. You CAN live like a (beauty) queen for next to nothing!  I get my hair dyed and styled for FREE on a regular basis at L’Oreal’s product evaluation center – here’s how http://frugalinda.com/what-would-you-do-for-a-goodie-bag/ AND get my hair cut at Frederic Fekkai FOR FREE (and there are other salons that do this too– here’s the skinny on being a hair model — http://www.wisebread.com/get-free-high-end-haircuts-as-a-hair-model — Of course, this doesn’t stop me from snagging all the freebies in my hotel room (when on the rare occasion, I find my self in one!) Laurie @thefrugalfarmer - November 8, 2013 Great tips here, Stefanie, and lots of new idea too!  Love the idea about stocking up on socks and underwear – we’ll have to try that one! That’s one of my favorites.  Laundry is time AND money, so if I can cut back on it it’s a double win. Great post!  I love your tip about the laundry!  One thing I’ve done in the past to save on primping is get my hair cut at a beauty school.  The students need customers to learn on and they are supervised.  It’s usually quite a bit cheaper than a regular salon.  I even had my hair done by beauty students on our wedding day and it saved us a lot of money. way to take a stand, stefanie.  i have been dying for a dog, but i agree, i need to save all that money instead!  it’s funny, now that i am pregnant, i have become mrs. grinch.  not even because i’m trying to be a grinch, but stuff like manis, pedis, haircuts, clothing, mean nothing to me anymore.  it’s kinda sad as i work for a conservative bank, but i come in the office wearing sweats and sweaters(when previously i used to wear business dresses).  i told my mom this on the phone and she pleaded with me to please go buy work-appropriate attire.  sadly i am too lazy and don’t really care to look great. Stefanie @ The Broke and Beautiful Life - November 9, 2013 Simon @ Modest Money - November 10, 2013 Its always amazing the myriad ways we can pinch a penny till it bleeds in our daily life. Am a huge fan of healthy eating and exercise and always finding cheaper alternatives to achieve those goals. Learning to cook was one of the best things I have done of late, eating home instead of restaurants have shaved a lot from my budget ? Terry @EasyFinancialTips - November 11, 2013 These are great tips! The one that resonates with me the most is about pets. Dogs can cost hundreds– or even thousands– of dollars, and that’s not including the costs of the food, cages, and other necessary materials. Even fish are expensive– a small tank can cost a hundred dollars or more without factoring in the costs of the individual fish, their food, materials for the tank and more. Pets are not a one-time expense, and that is important to remember! Stefanie @ The Broke and Beautiful Life - November 11, 2013 Great point Terry.  They are not a one time expense, even if they seem like an “easy” pet, like the fish. Notify me of follow-up comments by email.
