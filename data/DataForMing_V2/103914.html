Verizon: Mobile Video Service - All Gravy - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha Verizon continues moving forward with a mobile video service that will take advantage of the capabilities from the recent AOL merger. Due to the its position in the pay-TV market, the new offering isn't likely to cannibalize existing services. Verizon isn't likely to see anything material from the mobile video offering, but does set the wireless provider up for the future. The planned new mobile video service from Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ ) and a prime reason for the AOL deal is all gravy for the company. The service isn't guaranteed to work, but it provides Verizon the rare opportunity to offer a service that expands rather than cannibalizes existing services. Most of the competitors in the Internet TV and OTT area are offering services that expand or replace existing services already offered in traditional pay-TV. Sure Verizon already offers pay-TV services via FiOS, but the service is very limited in reach. The company is now listed as a distant sixth largest pay-TV provider placing it far down the list. Does that place Verizon with the most to gain from a mobile video service enhanced by the recent AOL merger? Verizon is generally unique in that it plans to offer a mobile-first platform for the video service. The service will focus primarily on top performance for Verizon wireless customers, but it will become generally available to customers of other wireless providers. The service will include live programming including a deal with the NFL along with Live Earth Concert. Verizon evenly inked a deal with Scripps Networks Interactive (NYSE: SNI ) to offer video offerings on the mobile service. The deal includes more than 45 series including programming from HGTV and the Food Network. Maybe the most interesting aspect of the deal is the intent to offer ad-supported data options. Verizon should be able to utilize the digital-ad network obtained from the AOL deal to fill up the video service with high-quality ads to help cover the costs of the high data usage and congestion such a service will place on the network. So while Verizon does have nearly 6 million pay-TV customers, it has over 100 million wireless customers to sell the new video service. It is possible that some of the customers that only recently signed up for FiOS would willingly cut the service for the new OTT, but that doesn't appear the likely customer. As the chart above shows, the majority of the pay-TV defectors are coming from the cable companies to the tune of nearly 1.2 million subscribers in 2014 alone. The biggest question is whether the revenues will meaningfully add to the already monster revenue base of $131 billion this year. AOL alone added another $2.7 billion in annual revenue to the pie. A better question is whether a mobile video service will even materially impact the AOL revenue base. Doing some quick math, a quick one million customers at $20 a month adds roughly $60 million to quarterly revenue. An amount that is only equivalent to 10% of the current revenue of AOL. Remember that the typical "cord-cutters" and the millennial target audience is looking for a TV offering that is significantly lower than the typical cable bill. The company hasn't listed prices, but one has to assume that the initial price or at least base price is no more than $20. The recent Sling TV offering by Dish Network (NASDAQ: DISH ) is reported to have already collected 250,000 subscribers. The service offers a core package at $20 a month and provides packages for an additional $5 a month. Clearly one of the best OTT offerings in the market isn't generating meaningful revenue. The mobile video service from Verizon probably isn't going to set any records either. Verizon is in the unique situation of having a top wireless network and not a material pay-TV customer base. The company is situated to where it can develop a mobile video service that doesn't cannibalize existing customers. At the same time, Verizon can be innovative with a focus on mobile and the ability to use an ad-supported network to enhance data traffic and lower costs to consumers. The business opportunity appears all gravy to Verizon at this point though the revenue generated from the service won't offer any material impacts in the short term. In the long term, this is likely the future of pay-TV and Verizon is ahead of the pack.
