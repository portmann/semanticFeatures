How We Saved $100 Per Month in Just 15 Minutes - Frugal Rules Posted on August 17, 2015 by John Schmoll in Frugal Living , Money Management At the heart of frugal living Â is finding value in the services or products youâ€™re using. That doesnâ€™t necessarily mean, in my opinion that youâ€™re always going to pick the cheapest option; rather, being frugal means choosing value over price. Well, my friends, I’ve been guilty of years of overpaying in one significant area of our lives â€“ our cell phone bill. About a year ago I told myself â€˜No more!â€™ and knew that once our contracts were up with Verizon Iâ€™d be running as fast as my legs could take me. The result of my quest for value is that we’re now saving $100 per month! When we had our plan with Verizon, we were paying right at $170 per month. In fact, in 2014 we gave them $2,035.12 of our hard earned money â€“ coming out to $169.59 per month. I don’t know about you, but that’s a chunk of money I can easily use in many other, more value-laden ways. The thing is, we werenâ€™t the only ones paying that much â€“ or more, for our cell phone bills. Take a look at some of the following numbers: CBS reports the average Verizon bill is $148 per month with other major players just behind them. ABC News reports the average American spends at least $1,000 per year on their cell phone bill. Business Insider reports that the average cell phone bill is up more than 50 percent since 2007. If youâ€™re â€œaverageâ€? when it comes to your cell phone service, youâ€™re probably overpaying. What makes it worse is the same ABC News report points out that weâ€™re wasting at least $50 billion per year on cell services we donâ€™t use. That wasteful spending Â was something I didn’t want to be guilty of any longer. Since we work from home, our data needs are very modest and even when we are out, we’re on Wi-Fi most of the time. There are numerous cheap cell phone plans Â to choose from. When we got our first cell phones, that wasn’t the case. We could choose from Verizon, AT&T and TracFone. There are many more options today. Originally, we were going to go with Republic Wireless , as we know many who use and like them. Whatâ€™s not to like about the opportunity to have a $5 per month cell phone bill? We also looked at Straight Talk Â as they start out at $30 per month but were a bit limited for us with regards to talk minutes on that plan. As Mrs. Frugal Rules wanted to keep her iPhone we looked for a carrier that would accommodate that desire. After some research, we finally landed on Cricket Wireless . Cricket allowed us to bring over our own phones. Mrs. Frugal Rules bought a new iPhone (as the one she had on Verizon could only work with them), and I simply brought over the phone I was already using. The cost for our new monthly service is $35/month after a $5 monthly discount for auto pay, resulting in $70 total per month and thus saving us $100 per month! We each get 2.5 GB of data and unlimited everything else for that cost. The best part? If the C-note savings each month isnâ€™t enough, there are no taxes on top of that $35. Nebraska is one of the worst states when it comes to taxes on cell phone bills, coming out at over 20 percent. However, our bill will stay at $35 per month for good, or until Cricket decides to raise prices. We had concerns with the coverage since we’ve always been on Verizon but we haven’t been disappointed as Cricket operates on the AT&T network; even with all of our traveling, we haven’t encountered any dead zones. Cricket allows you to bring over unlocked cell phones Â so after a $10 SIM card charge, we were good to go. The switch took maybe 15 minutes of our time. Not too shabby in my book. We now have the “problem” of deciding where to put that extra $100 each month. It’ll likely either go towards additional retirement savings or our new home purchase . Weâ€™ll be deciding at year-end once we see where we stand on the retirement front. Itâ€™s easy to stick with what you know. Itâ€™s convenient. Itâ€™s comfortable. My counter to comfort is to consider how much time itâ€™s worth to you to save $100 or more each month for little to no change in the service youâ€™re receiving? For me, the few hours of research and 15 minutes in the store I spent was well worth it. Making your money work better for you and paying less for something without a drop in service level is a win-win in my book. Plus, this experience has launched a new mission for me â€“ after seeing what we can save on our cell phone bill, our cable bill isnâ€™t far behind . How much do you pay for cell phone service each month? What could you do with an extra $100 per month? Whatâ€™s one cost youâ€™ve wanted to cut but have avoided reducing?

Latest posts by John Schmoll ( see all ) Well done! I will be very surprised over the next year or two if people are still paying $100+ for their plans. Interesting that Cricket uses AT&T. Republic and Straight Talk don’t work where we live because Sprint is non-existent. I will have to check and see if that one is available. We get partial reimbursement back for our cell service from Jim’s job but it would be nice to save more. I’m sort of a brand-snob when it comes to my technology. I only buy Apple and I haven’t left Verizon – ever. I’ve had the same phone company since I was 16! That said, I get a major discounted bill since I’ve been there fore so many years. It used to be that my employer paid for my bill, but after the job change I had recently, I pay about $65 for internet, phone, and text. It’s worth it to me (and I don’t have cable or anything, so this is my biggest expense). We have used Republic Wireless and Ting. I like both!  We currently have Ting and each of our bills fluctuates between $28 – $35. I can live with that! Wow great job! So many people overspend when it comes to their cell phones each month. This is an area we are reevaluating as we want something cheaper but we also need service all over since we are in an RV. We haven’t made the switch yet, just because Sprint doesn’t have great coverage where we travel, but I recently called Verizon and got my bill lowered by $20 AND added additional data (that we really do use). So that’s not bad! Nice!  I would love to move from AT&T but we are grandfathered into their unlimited data plan.  Even though our two phone family plan is $160/month we use a ton of data.  I’d love to try Cricket but I think we would end up wiping out the savings with the $5/gig extra data use.
