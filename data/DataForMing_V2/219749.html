ETF Hub Oct 28 2015, 20:12 ET | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Star Wars: The Force Awakens (NYSE: DIS ) still hasn't locked down a release in key market China, according to execs on the Imax earnings call , though they are hopeful that it can come in January. China maintains a 34-film quota for foreign releases and that number's been hit for 2015. So Disney needed to push to 2016. “We’re hopeful and optimistic" for a January release, says Imax Entertainment (NYSE: IMAX ) President Greg Foster. "But until the date is finalized it’s only a ‘guesstimate.' " With heavy investment in China, Imax may need a quick China release even more than Disney. Imax chief Richard Gelfond said he thinks that within two years, China would pass North America to become the No. 1 movie market. Imax rose 1.9% after hours following its earnings release . When can we expect an regulator approval the upcoming Star Wars movie in 2016? It will be a huge source of future revenue growth for DIS. The Chinese will pirate The Force Awakens and begin showing nationwide 1 month before the rest of the world sees it. Don't worry. It'll be released in January in China. That Star Wars event on a part of the Great Wall of China was great.
