Apple: iPhone 8 Will Be The iPhone Steve Jobs Wanted - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha The iPhone 7 looks set to be a disappointment. However, the iPhone 8, out in 2017, will probably surprise positively. Indeed, it might even be a proper "magical" iPhone. This article explains why. It also explains why we can consider the iPhone 8 to be one where Steve Jobs himself had an hand in conceiving it. Amazingly, Steve Jobs' biography yields clues to Apple's iPhone 8, making it a phone on which we can say Steve Jobs actually had an hand in conceiving it. Let us first start with a disclaimer. Contrary to the iPhone 7, where rumors have mostly given way to leaks , what I will write about on this article - the iPhone 8 - is still in the rumor stage. Some of the compromises Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) would have to take with the design I'll describe might be too much for its management to swallow. In each compromise, there is risk. For instance, even today we don't know for certain if the iPhone 7 will have a headphone jack or not. The leaks go both ways. It can even happen that some models have it and some don't. Every time such a difficult compromise takes place, management has to debate it hard and come to terms with the possible upsides and downsides. When Steve Jobs was alive, his word was final. Now, a lot more fighting and uncertainty is to be expected. Back then, a single word from Jobs could remove a floppy disk drive, make the iMac hard to open or impossible to upgrade, or make the mouse have only 1 button. Today, it's different. As we will be seeing throughout this article, the compromises for the iPhone 8 will be very real. What will be at stake won't be the technical feasibility - it will just be down to management accepting those compromises or not. I will also present a no-compromises "Steve Jobs" design, though bits of it might die in the management approval process, even if Jobs turns in its grave for it. Finally, it's likely that the iPhone 8 will have three variants, one of which is the magical iPhone 8 I will be describing, with the other two being more conventional. I shouldn't have to repeat it, but here it goes. Apple is the iPhone. Apple's stock will do as the iPhone does. It should be evident by now. The iPhone represents 80%+ of Apple's profitability, and for as long as that remains the case, Apple's stock will do as the iPhone does and everything else will be mostly a sideshow. Apple's stock has been weak because the iPhone 6s has been weak year-on-year as I predicted. The iPhone 7 will be outwardly similar to the iPhone 6s, and thus shouldn't provide much of a positive bump either. However, the run-up to a new iPhone unveiling is also a powerful effect - so Apple stock is likely to outperform in the month or so to the iPhone 7 unveil event which should take place around mid-September. Nearer the end of the article, I will coalesce this with the observations I am going to make on the iPhone 8. This will provide us with a roadmap for Apple stock's expected under and outperformance. The iPhone 8: A True Steve Jobs iPhone You might think that putting Steve Jobs in the title was some kind of click bait. You might think that, ultimately, I'd just point to some kind of possible design trait and say "that's just like Steve Jobs would have done it!". Alas, that's not the reason Steve Jobs is in the title. Instead, Steve Jobs is in the title because he literally wanted the kind of iPhone that's rumored to be coming in 2017. I'll explain why. First, a bit more background. Several sources are rumoring that the iPhone 8 (perhaps iPhone 10, since it's the iPhone's 10th anniversary?) to be launched in 2017 will be an all-glass design. Two sources appear as most relevant: KGI Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who has a good track record of predicting past iPhone designs (and feature sets), predicted the iPhone 8 would have an all-glass exterior. Allen Horng , chairman and CEO of Catcher Technology, which supplies Apple with metal casings, said: It is this all-glass iPhone, where the entire exterior will be made of glass, with no metal rim, that I say is a true Steve Jobs iPhone. Not because of it being all-glass and pretty, though, but because its idea was created and delved into while Steve Jobs himself was still alive (and likely contributing to it). How do I know this? By sheer coincidence. I have the Portuguese version of Walter Isaacson's "Steve Jobs" biography and I've noticed a curious difference between it and the English version. The difference is that the English version is missing an interesting paragraph. The "offending" paragraph is missing from the "iPhone" section, "Gorilla glass" sub-section. Here are a couple of pictures of said paragraph in the Portuguese version: It translates as follows (bold highlight is mine): Weeks became friends with Jony Ive, who sometimes came to visit him at his lake house north of New York. "I can show Jony some similar glass samples, and he can tell them apart just by touching them," said Weeks. "Only my head of research can do the same. And when you show something to Steve, he either likes it - or doesn't like it - instantly. But Jony, he plays with it, examines it, studies the tinniest detail and capabilities." In 2010, Ive took his most senior managers to a Corning factory, to make glass together with the specialist glass makers there. The company that year was working on a tremendously stronger glass, codenamed "Godzilla Glass," and it hoped someday to be able to make glass and ceramic tough enough to be used for an iPhone that would not need to have a metal rim. "Jobs and Apple made us better," Weeks said. "Each of us are fanatical about the products we make." Basically this confirms that Apple was looking at producing an all-glass iPhone without an external metal rim as far back as 2010. During 2010, of course, Steve Jobs was still alive. Steve Jobs remained CEO of Apple until August 24, 2011, though he was given a leave of absence on January 17, 2011 - upon which he supposedly continued to be involved with major strategic decisions (any decision on the iPhone certainly would classify as such). Anyway, it was obvious that during 2010 this work around the iPhone was happening under Steve Jobs watch. These patents include the methods which would be used to produce an all-glass device: Starting from a hollow glass tube, operations would be made to it to allow for necessary ports, mics, etc. Parts of the tube could be textured (allowing for zones of greater grip). Necessary coatings would be applied (oleophobic, etc). Internal components (display, motherboard, battery, etc) would be inserted through one end of the hollow tube. End caps would be applied, to complete the all-glass design and seal the housing. These end caps could also be laser welded so as to provide a seamless glass device. Alternatively, instead of using an hollow tube to start the process, Apple describes the ability to start with 2 parts to make up the tube through laser welding. This could be necessary to ease display fabrication, for instance. Apple describes ways to insert the display so as to allow an edge-to-edge display or even a wrap-around display (less likely to be done). What Would An All-Glass Device Mean? Apple achieving this all-glass iPhone would again thrust Apple to the forefront of unique design. No longer would the present design disadvantage live on. The present design disadvantage is evident when you compare an iPhone 6s to a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. The iPhone, designed to be all-glass, would appear as a seamless phone with an edge-to-edge display and yield an unparalleled luxury feel. It would look magical, for the sheer apparent impossibility of fitting its innards inside, the cleanliness of lines, or because of the beauty of the edge-to-edge display in such a glass monolith. Apple will probably not go out and produce all devices to the level I am about to describe. Certainly, it will also field more conservative versions, more akin to the present construction: Using more glass and having smaller bezels. However, and this is consistent with what the CEO of Catcher Technology said, Apple is likely to launch an all-glass model. This model, if it were as radical as Steve Jobs would probably want, could appear as futuristic as a simple and seamless glass block. Magical, if you will, containing the iPhone's entire feature set within a block of glass whose only likely breaks would be speaker and microphone holes. The technology is here to produce such a device. Not just the manufacturing technology for the device itself as described in Apple's patents, but also the possibility of: Having no lightning port. All of the iPhone's interactions with the exterior would be made wireless. This includes charging. Again, this is consistent with the now-persistent rumors of Apple's interest in wireless charging technology. Having no headphone jack (along with no lightning port). How would you connect headphones to it? Using Bluetooth. Present wireless headphones have reached a level of quality which can render a wired connection useless. Apple's rumored interest in wireless headphones jives with this angle. Having no volume, power or mute buttons. All of these functions would be left to the wrap-around touch technology (even if the display in my view would only to towards providing edge-to-edge image, much like the Samsung S7 Edge already does). Notice that the possibility of using virtual buttons is already contemplated in Apple's patents. No home button. TouchID would be substituted by behind-the-glass technology similar to what Synaptics already has . The technology is here. No SIM tray. The SIM would go all-software on an embedded chip. The technology is here as well , with only carrier adoption being a doubt but with there being more than enough time to achieve it. New display technology, OLED. OLED is necessary because it can be flexible and provide edge-to-edge capabilities similar to those implemented by Samsung in the Samsung S6 Edge and S6 Edge. If you put it all together, all of the recent rumors about Apple point in the same direction. They point into a direction where all of the technologies necessary to make a monolithic all-glass iPhone with an edge-to-edge display are here. This iPhone is going to be the iPhone 8, though probably in a unique product line because of the intrinsic aggressiveness in making this no-compromises glass monolith. Finally, it's clear that such a monolith would, indeed, be what Steve Jobs would have wanted. It's also clear that the idea started with him alive and only failed to come to fruition back then because not all of the technologies make it real were ready yet. Implications For Apple's Stock Going Forward If Apple is able to pull off the technical marvel described above, Apple will (for a while, at least) completely regain the high-end of the market. Such an iPhone would be a luxurious item with no parallel in the marketplace. Quite possibly it would be priced above other iPhone models as well, and still sell massively. It would also have another implications: Apple's patents might have a level of enforceability, leading to delays in a competitive response. Such delays would be positive for Apple's valuation, since its moat would appear as more durable. Taking into account this development, here's what I think Apple's under/outperformance will look like for the next year and a half (the chart also includes how recent under/outperformance predictions fared due to the iPhone 6S): From November 2015, when I published my article titled " Several iPhone Risks In Review: Apple Is About To Show Declining iPhone Shipments " and up until August 2016, when the iPhone 7 upcoming unveiling starts having its effect, we should see underperformance (most of it already in the past at this point). Then we should see some outperformance into the iPhone 7 event. Then underperformance after the event due to the iPhone 7's lack of design innovation. This was already more or less the roadmap. What is new is what should happen during 2017. Notice that instead of just seeing outperformance starting 1 month before the iPhone 8 is unveiled, I see it much sooner. Indeed, I think outperformance might start as early as March 2017. The reason is simple: around that date credible leaks on the new iPhone will start coming out. And this time, the new iPhone will truly be something unique. So unique that it might prompt outperformance and demand for Apple shares much earlier on that usual. A problem which will be ongoing for Apple is that the smartphone market might have matured and be somewhat saturated. This affects all smartphone makers. Indeed, as per IDC the entire smartphone market has gone flat year-on-year as of Q1 2016. This problem might pressure Apple's stock performance even if Apple pulls off a brilliant device (which seems likely at this point). I believe the iPhone 7 will lead to further Apple underperformance. However, the iPhone 8 seems likely to provide a true turnaround catalyst for Apple's stock and fundamental performance. At this point, between leaks, technological advances, Apple patents and historical facts, we have reason to believe that the iPhone 8 will be something so unique that it might well rekindle Apple's fortunes. When this magical device starts being better known, it is likely that Apple's undervalued status will lead to its stock strongly outperforming the market. However, caution must be advised in the sense that: Near-term, no favorable catalyst exists for Apple stock. And it might happen that the overall smartphone market might put a spanner in the optimism I have for the iPhone 8. Still, my prediction for Apple's stock performance is as stated: I expect Apple stock to show solid outperformance well ahead of the iPhone 8 introduction, perhaps starting as early as March 2017. While the article is tagged "Long Idea", it's important to read the entire text (and chart) to see the specific timings where it would make sense to be long.
