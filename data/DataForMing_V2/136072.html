Is It Time To Sell Skyworks Solutions? - Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) | Seeking Alpha Skyworks has appreciated considerably, but investors shouldn't consider selling the stock just yet. Skyworks is less prone to being dominated by Apple than other suppliers. Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ: SWKS ) is one of the few stocks that makes me regret my decision of not trading foreign stocks. Skyworks has appreciated nearly 350% since I first recommended buying it in January 2014. Since then, I have recommended buying the stock many times, and the company has appreciated on every occasion. The stock took a beating recently due to Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) weak guidance, and has continued its downward spiral following Qorov's (NASDAQ: QRVO ) earnings release. Despite the fact that Skyworks beat the earnings estimate and is guiding higher for the upcoming quarter, shares are have lost 10% value over the last few weeks. While investors who have recorded triple digit growth may be considering selling the stock, I think the pullback has opened up a buying opportunity for long-term investors. Skyworks' quarterly report highlights the facts that the company still has room to run higher and is still a buy. Apple has contributed greatly to Skyworks rise over the last two years. So, investors were rightly worried about Skyworks prospects when Apple guidance for the upcoming quarter was weak. However, the fact that Skyworks managed to beat estimates despite Apple selling less-than-expected iPhones shows that the company has diversified revenue streams. Without doubt, Apple is a very important customer for Skyworks. The company generates roughly 20% of its revenue from Apple. But the figure has been declining consistently since 2012, and I expect this trend to continue. Almost every great company has a diversified revenue stream, however reducing dependency on Apple is a big plus for Skyworks' due to Apple's tendency of dominating suppliers. Apple has a history of dominating suppliers. The Cupertino giant forces its suppliers to operate at razor-thin margins, and this has negatively affected companies like GT Advanced Technologies and Cirrus Logic. Apple was able to dominate these companies because they were heavily reliant on Apple. So, by diversifying its revenue streams, Skyworks is also protecting itself from being dominated by Apple in the future. Despite Apple having high pricing power, Skyworks has been able to increase its dollar content in each iPhone significantly. In fact, Skyworks has been gaining dollar content with all its customers. This indicates that customers need Skyworks' product and the chipmaker will not suffer like Cirrus or GTAT in the future. Skyworks has become an important supplier for its Apple may even see a further increase in dollar content in the upcoming iPhone 6S. In fact, as explained by author Anthony Clarke, Apple may need Skyworks more than Skyworks needs Apple. Mr. Clarke said: "Clearly Apple is as valuable a customer as a company can be. The point here is that Skyworks Solutions technology enhances Apple's products and therefore the Apple customer experience. Skyworks Solutions is an analog semiconductor company. Its technology supports broadband, wireless connectivity, GPS, automotive, energy management, military, medical devices, etc. Essentially, SWKS is an integral part of the Internet of Things." Despite the massive appreciation, Skyworks is trading at 25x trailing earnings. By comparison, Qorvo is trading at over 28x trailing earnings. Also, Qorvo has guidance for the upcoming quarter was soft. Given that both Qorvo and Skyworks operate in the same segments, the fact that Skyworks' guidance was strong highlights the company's diversification strengths. In addition, the company's gross margin is also growing, which shows that the company isn't facing stiff competition from peers. Gross margin for the latest reported quarter jumped 360 basis points y-o-y to 49% and may increase to 55% in the future. The company is also well positioned to benefit from the transition to 4G phones. Over 90% of people today use 2G or 3G phones. However, people are expected to switch to 4G phones due to reducing prices. This trend will facilitate an increase in the need for RF solutions, and will ultimately benefit Skyworks. Given the positives, I think Skyworks will continue moving higher and investors shouldn't consider taking profits off the table just yet. Skyworks may have appreciated considerably since my first call, but if I ever decide to invest in overseas markets, Skyworks will definitely be my first pick. Being an Apple supplier has certainly helped Skyworks a lot, but I like the company because of its diversified revenue stream. The company is still trading at a cheap valuation, which is why I think it is still a buy. Source: Is It Time To Sell Skyworks Solutions?
