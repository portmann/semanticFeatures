Microsoft And 'One-Time Investing' - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha In 1999, shares of Microsoft were trading near $60 as compared to todayâ€™s mark closer to $40. Given this information, you might suppose that Microsoft has been a poor investment. At the end of 1999, shares of Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) were trading at a split-adjusted price near $58. In turn, this also means that the earnings multiple during this time was in the 70 range, but for the moment, let's side step that information. Today, shares of Microsoft exchange hands around $42 . As such, it seems obvious that this hasn't been a great investment - you "lost" $16 in capital depreciation. Even if you include dividends received , an initial investment at the end of 1999 would have compounded at a negative 1% rate. Every $1,000 that you invested back then would only be worth $900 or so today. This is the essence of media sensationalism and why a typical investor might get spooked out of consistently investing. It's easy to picture the "dot com" crash or the recent recession and suppose that these types of events will occur again. The logic is on point but not the takeaway. In the future, we will see tribulations, economic "crisis" and instances where stock prices "do nothing" or worse for prolonged periods - as was the case with the above Microsoft example. However, it does not follow that this automatically translates to poor investing returns, quite the contrary actually. This is a situation, or a situational folly, that I like to call "one-time investing." The media likes to tell tales like the one above to catch your attention. They tell you that the NASDAQ has "done nothing" over the past 15 years or that Microsoft is still selling below its tech bubble high today. It's not inaccurate: Microsoft is selling below $58 today. Yet this is quite misleading. Producing statements like these makes a very critical mistake: it assumes you invest just once. It assumes that you invest at the very highest possible point and then sit around sucking your thumb for the next 15 years hoping something good might happen. Of course, this is not reality. Instead of making a single investment in your lifetime, you make hundreds, perhaps thousands. Instead of plopping down a lump sum at the high, you likely invest regularly, say twice a month, monthly or at worst yearly. Why? Well that's when you get paid. Even if you wanted to make that one-time lump sum investment that so many often refer to, you probably couldn't do it. Not because it could be misguided, but because you can't convince your employer or customers to pay for 15 years of work upfront. Instead, you periodically earn money, which you can then take a portion to periodically invest. Thus the "one-time investment," while headline grabbing, rarely if ever occurs. With that perspective in mind, let's reexamine the "awful" Microsoft investment that you could have made. However, this time instead of investing just once, let's imagine that you invest at the end of each and every year starting with 1999. Here's what $1,000 annual investments would look like: From the above table, we can glean a variety of information. First, notice the 1999 row. Indeed, if you were to make a $1,000 investment at the end of 1999 the share price today would be just over $700 and the total value still under $900. Note that the end price is as of the April 6th close, but the dividends received only carry through the end of 2014. This 1999 investment has not yet been productive. Yet take a look at 2000 through 2013. In every single instance, the end share price is higher and the total value is above $1,000. This is a much more realistic picture. Instead of investing just once, you're apt to invest consistently and over a great deal of time, decades for instance. A secondary realization comes in the way of looking not at the worst possible investment during this period - as the media often does - but in reviewing the best of times. Had you bought shares at the end of 2008, your $1,000 investment would now have a total value over $2,400. This is better even than 2000 when the share price was just $2 higher and you would have had more time to collect dividends. However, that's not exactly the takeaway. Here's the point: at the end of 2008, shares were trading around $19, but by the end of 2009, shares were closer to $30. As such, given 60% price appreciation in one year, you might have thought that you "missed the boat." Yet that wasn't exactly the case. Here's a look at the annual compound returns starting from the end of each year: Obviously, the end 2008 would have been a solid time to invest. But this also holds for 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 - despite the higher share price. This is the type of thing that's difficult to discern from a stock chart. When you see a high mark back in 1999 and then a lower price today, it's easy to discount the security. You could call it " dead money " or suggest that it has "gone nowhere." Yet when you go through an exercise like the one above, important realizations emerge. Saying Microsoft traded at $58 in 1999 and is presently, trading around $42 today is only useful if you made a one-time investment and sat around for the next 15 years. A more relevant scenario would be to see what happens over time - to see what happens when you think about the reality of investing. You're going to be doing this for a long time. As such, it makes sense to judge both your investments and future prospects on a variety of timelines.
