Disney World ? Is it Worth the Cost? - Frugal Rules Posted on October 19, 2015 by John Schmoll in Traveling Believe it or not, Disney World does not scream frugal ? shocker, I know. Heck, going to Disney presents ample opportunity to spend a minor fortune. I took the oldest little Frugal Rule to Disney World last month ?as a surprise for her 8th birthday. I used rewards points ?to fund most of the trip. Truth be told, we would not have made the trek to see the Mouse if it weren?t for those points. Airfare and lodging was the easy part for our trip to Disney. Having the Southwest companion pass, we were able to get to Orlando for 18,000 points ? she traveled with me as my companion and $22.40. We stayed at the Sheraton Lake Buena Vista Resort , which was about five miles from the park, for 8,000 SPG points total for two evenings. We really enjoyed the hotel, they offered free transportation to the park and had two awesome pools that our daughter enjoyed nearly as much as the park. We stayed at my Mom?s house the remaining two evenings so that was no cost. Then there were the tickets for the park. After doing some quick research, I realized there was no real way to save money on Disney tickets. That?s part of what bothers me about the Disney experience. If you want to get discounted tickets, the minimum ticket purchase (so far as I could tell) was three days. That was something I was not willing to do, so I was left buying the tickets at full price – $105 for myself and $99 for my daughter for a total of $217.27 including the tax. I used a $250 statement credit to purchase said tickets. ***If you’re interested in travel hacking like this, check out some of the best credit cards to do that here !*** So far, the cost wasn?t too bad. I wasn?t a fan of the admission prices, but at least it was no money out of pocket. That ended quickly? There are ways to save money at Disney. For example, we took in our own lunch and brought in a water bottle to refill. That allowed us to only need to buy one meal. We spent about $30 on dinner. While pricier than I would like, it was relatively cheaper than many other options. The savings pretty much ended there. The extras were what added to the cost. My Mom was insistent we go to the 1900 Park Fare restaurant ?for their Cinderella dinner the evening before our day at the park. It was a character dinner that simply wasn?t worth the cost. A few characters came around to take pictures, but the $102 final bill for my daughter and I was a bit tough to swallow considering the quality of the food and the overall experience. If that bill wasn?t enough, my Mom also wanted to get my daughter done up as a princess. Because what little girl doesn?t want to be done up in 100 degree weather? ? Thankfully, grandma footed the $150 bill, but it was a horrible waste of money considering that she asked to change back in to her normal outfit within an hour in the park. Ultimately, I don?t believe the costs to go to Disney are worth it. If you take out the rewards I used to make this trip possible, it would?ve cost us easily over $1,000 for a one-day event! I know, it makes me sound cold and uncaring. Don?t get me wrong, my daughter and I created memories that will last a lifetime. I?ll always cherish those memories. You know what though? She enjoyed the hotel pool nearly as much as the park. Yes, of course, she loved the park as she could overdose on all things Frozen ?but it showed me once again that it?s often the simple things kids enjoy. She enjoyed getting one-on-one time with me and spending time in the pool. That can be done anywhere without dropping a small fortune or fighting crowds. As an aside, if you love Disney and feel I?m being too harsh, hold on to your hat because Mrs. Frugal Rules will be writing a post of her own on her experience taking our middle little Frugal Rule to Disneyland later this week – again, largely on points. She absolutely adores the park (I think she?d say it really is the Happiest Place on Earth) so you should get a different perspective on the value of a Disney trip from her.

Is it Worth the Cost? - October 19, 2015 2015 Goals Update: Ending the Year on a High Note - October 12, 2015 That’s the way to do it! I think we’ll try that in a few years. We took a 5, 3, and 1 year old 2 years ago, and that is definitely NOT worth it I’m with you. In glad we’ve done it but would not shell out to go again. We can take three other trips for the price of Disney. We’re heading to Disney next year, but thankfully we’ve also found ways to reduce the cost.  We’re staying at a friend’s timeshare, so no hotel costs, and we can cook in the kitchen.  We’re flying, but will be able to cover the cost with statement credits, and Disney does have a military program that will allow us to purchase 4-day passes for $177 each.  Will it be an expensive vacation still?  Yes, probably, but hopefully we’ll find it to be the happiest place on earth! Sounds like you’ve done a great job at cutting down the costs for the trip! We did the military pass thing a few years ago as we have military in our family and that saved a nice chunk of money. Being able to cook on your own will save a small fortune. There are less ethical ways to save money on Disney tickets. I know a few people who bank accounts sending mail to their friends or family in Florida. Just saying. That’s the thing though – I only found you could get resident tickets for 3+ days. Theres no way I found to get in for 1 day at some sort of a discount. There should be ways to get some sort of a discount for those who only want to go for a day. We *might* go someday. Still, I have trouble justifying the price of admission! It would be nearly $400 per day for the four of us to walk in the front gates! And that’s without a dollar spent on food or anything else. If it weren’t for the rewards, I’d have trouble justifying it. Heck, even with those it was hard to justify it. It can be! My wife and I did that a few times when we lived in San Diego…but she had grandfathered season passes that were relatively inexpensive. It honestly shocks me how expensive Disney is when I consider the target audience and their income level. Luckily, I can usually get into the park for free because I know someone working there. One of the very few perks of having worked in theater You’re exactly right Stefanie! That’s especially the case given the vision Walt had behind it – a place for parents to take their children to enjoy themselves. I’m sure we’ll bite the bullet and take our daughter sometime in the next couple of years because we feel it’s one of those “everyone who can should go once” sorts of things. I’m pretty sure we’ll drive down from NC, stay with family, and only go to the park for one day, which will all help with the cost. It’s a difficult thing to do cheaply, though. I took my son to Disney 2 years ago when he was 3. We loved the time over there and we all had lots of fun. We visited my family in California and therefore it was the main purpose of the trip. So the Disney visit was just a prompt decision. But the good thing was, we only went one full day and didn’t have to pay for hotel as we stayed at my sister’s place.
