Ask the Readers: Do You Shop Black Friday Deals? Black Friday is one of the biggest retail events of the year. For many people, it is an event — they scour ads, plan out which stores to hit and what to get at each, and even camp out the night before. For many other people, the low prices aren't worth the chaos...and may instead opt to shop on Cyber Monday. Do you shop Black Friday deals? What are your strategies for getting the best deals?

I don't shop Black Friday sales. It's too crazy and people are too violent. I relax at home and watch the news reports of the madness. I'm a minimalist so I don't like lots of stuff and neither do my friends or family so the sales don't matter to us. It's also hypocritical to give thanks for the things that you have only to go out the next day and try to buy as much as possible and behave poorly doing it. Thanksgiving weekend is about gratitude and enjoying what you have not getting more things you don't need.
