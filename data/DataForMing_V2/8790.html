Apple's Reported Price Raises: Will They Help Or Hurt? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Company has reportedly raised prices to offset currency issues. This will have more of an impact on fiscal Q3. In recent months, I've become more worried about the impact of a rising dollar on technology giant Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). The Dollar Currency Index ("DCI") has soared, primarily thanks to the weakness in the Euro. That talk declined a little thanks to the Federal Reserve's statement which sent the dollar falling. Last week, my Apple fears rose as I worried about rising analyst estimates and the currency issue combining. I've discussed the possibility of Apple raising prices to combat these currency issues. Apple has reportedly done this, so today I want to look at some of the key takeaways. According to sources, Apple waited until after its "Spring Forward" event to raise prices, so these higher prices will only be in effect for about three weeks during the company's fiscal Q2. A majority of the quarter's sales will be at the lower prices, which I expect will be reflected in the ASP numbers reported next month. Apple has raised a number of product prices globally, as detailed below from MacRumors as well as AppAdvice . A spot check of the Apple Online Store in Canada, for example, reveals that Apple has increased the price of the unlocked iPhone 6 from between $749-$969 to $839-$1,099, Thunderbolt Displays from $999 to $1,199, and 15-inch Retina MacBook Pros from between $2,099-$2,699 to $2,449-$3,049. Apple also hiked the price on the 15-inch MacBook Pro in France, with the base model now starting at €2,249 up from €1,999, and the higher-spec model up to €2,799 from €2,499. The price increase affected all versions of the iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6, and iPhone 5s. For example, an unlocked 16GB iPhone 6 increased from AU$869 to AU$999. The entry-level 16GB iPhone 6 Plus jumped from AU$999 to AU$1,149. A 128GB iPhone 6 Plus jumped AU$200. Most of those reported price raises are in the mid to high teens, percentage wise, so these are not exactly small price increases. As a comparison, the DCI is up about 22% over the past year, although it is heavily weighted towards the Euro. It is interesting to note in the AppAdvice article above that iPad and MacBook prices had not increased yet in Australia. These reported increase are for many international markets only, due to the rise in currencies, and are not impacting products in the US. While investors might see these reported prices raises as great news, the issue of demand definitely comes into play now. If Apple raises a product's price by say 3% to 5%, there probably wouldn't be that much of a demand decline. However, when you are talking about some prices jumping by 20% or more, I think Apple will see a drop-off in demand in certain countries. You probably will see consumers "trade-down" as well, meaning that you will probably see more sales of cheaper models. For example, a consumer in Australia may buy the regular 16GB iPhone 6, as it now goes for AU$999, whereas the 16GB iPhone 6 Plus had previously gone for that amount. An initial examination of the iPhone 6 showed that profitability was higher on the Plus model, so these "trade-downs" could negatively impact margins for the company. Apple will most likely need to adjust its inventory and production levels going forward if these reported price changes are in fact accurate. So far, we've seen analysts raise their revenue average for fiscal Q2 to a new high, as seen in the table below. Remember, Apple guided to revenues of $52 billion to $55 billion for this quarter. The good news for investors is that Apple raised prices, which will help offset some of the currency issues the company is facing. On the flip side, Apple has to be careful not to raise prices too much because demand will fall off. Looking at the next couple of quarters, we should expect higher average selling prices but probably fewer units sold. Since the price raises reportedly went into effect during the second week of March, they will have a larger impact on the June-ending fiscal Q3 than the March-ending fiscal Q2. Apple will have an entire quarter in fiscal Q3 to sell these products at higher prices, versus just a couple of weeks in fiscal Q2. We'll get fiscal Q3 guidance from Apple next month. In recent fiscal years, Apple has seen more revenues from the Americas in fiscal Q3 than Q2, as seen in the table below. Having a larger percentage of revenues coming from the US helps mitigate this currency issue a bit. If these reports regarding price raises are in fact true, it would be a significant event for Apple. On the recent conference call , management stated that it generally tried to adjust prices only at the time of new launches. The company did increase prices in Russia thanks to that currency's large move, but that was just one country. The MacRumors article stated 8 specific countries, and mentioned "multiple others," where Apple reported raised prices. This is not something the company has done very often. On the call, management seemed like it wanted to wait to see what happened with currencies. However, with the DCI rising from 94 to 100 between the call and early March, it appears Apple had to respond. When the DCI is up 25% in the last 12 months, it seems as if the company reached a point where price raises were inevitable. In the end, Apple's reported price raises make me much more confident about the company meeting fiscal Q3 guidance than previously thought. Investors should realize, however, that these increases came very late in fiscal Q2, so there will not be a major impact on the current quarter's numbers. Overall, Apple has to walk a fine line here as it doesn't want to crater demand for its products, which are already going for premium prices. Also, Samsung's (OTC: SSNLF ) new Galaxy S6 phone was recently launched , which will provide some meaningful competition until Apple launches its new phones later this year. Hopefully, the news out of the Federal Reserve keeps the dollar in check for a little longer, so this currency issue won't be one I have to keep returning to. I'd rather be more focused on Apple entering the Dow and looking to hit a new all-time high, something I think is more possible thanks to the company increasing prices.
