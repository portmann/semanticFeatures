By Mary Beth Quirk September 17, 2015 Would you pay $50 for a 7? Amazon Fire? If not, Amazon thinks you might be down to pay $41 for one if its new tablets — if you’ve got six people you want to give one to. The company is announcing a new lineup of Fire tablets today, including six-packs of the 7? tablets — which usually go for $49.99 each — for $250. Unlike the new iPad Pro, which is aimed at the business sector, the new Fire tablets are all about entertainment, as David Limp, a senior vice president for Amazon devices, tells USAToday the devices are aimed at the “sweet spot, the consumption of media.” The new tablets are more tumble resistant than before, Amazon says, and feature a quad-core processor, front- and rear-facing cameras and up to 128 gb of expandable storage. There are also two new fire HD tablets in the Amazon store, one at 8? ($149.99) and one 10.1? ($229.99). Both are 7.7 millimeters thick and made for watching video content, with the aspect ratio of a wide-screen movie and speakers that Amazon says are twice as powerful as before. Amazon also announced new iterations of its Amazon Fire TV that comes with a voice remote that allows users to search and play media by speaking. That TV costs $99.99, with a gaming edition that comes with a game controller, more memory and two free games for $139.99. You can get the Fire TV stick with voice remote for $49.99 as well. Those systems will begin shipping on Oct. 5.
