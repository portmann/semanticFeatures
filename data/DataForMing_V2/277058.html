Anton Wahlman Positions For 2016: Thoughts On Major Automakers And Tesla Ahead Of CES | Seeking Alpha Dec. 30, 2015  7:00 AM ET  |  Includes: AAPL , BBRY , F , FCAU , GM , GOOG , GOOGL , HMC , NVDA , TM , TSLA , VLKAY by: Anton Wahlman GM's keynote will have the biggest market impact of the automakers present at CES. Expect Ford and Volkswagen to make headlines as well. Anton Wahlman is one of Seeking Alpha's top contributors on the automotive sector (with the occasional authoritative dabble into technology ). A former analyst with UBS (1996-2002), Needham (2002-2006) and Think Equity (2006-2008) covering the telecom infrastructure industry, Wahlman now focuses on researching the automotive industry. Ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), which will take place January 6-9, 2016, in Las Vegas, Seeking Alpha asked Wahlman what he thinks investors should be paying attention to in the new year. While the CES "floor" days are the 6th through the 9th, Wahlman points out that Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) and Faraday Future host events on the evening of January 4. Ford (NYSE: F ), Kia and Volkswagen ( OTCPK:VLKAY ) are up on the 5th, with General Motors (NYSE: GM ) is set to make headlines on the 6th. SA Editor Rocco Pendola (RP): With that in mind, here's what Wahlman expects from GM and the rest of the big three in 2016. Anton Wahlman (AW): I think the GM presentation will have the biggest market impact, followed by Volkswagen and Ford. The other press conferences are likely to have less significant market impacts. Mary Barra's January 6 press conference should be epic. It's the first time a GM CEO has keynoted CES. And, in many ways, GM has the most interesting near-term agenda for 2016. In terms of what we know the best, it's all about the Chevrolet Bolt. This $37,500 (or less) before tax adjustments 200-mile range pure battery-electric vehicle (BEV) will be introduced on January 6 and is widely rumored to enter production in the fourth quarter of 2016. The Chevy Bolt will be the first practical family 200-mile range BEV sold near this price. You may remember how Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA ) investment thesis has evolved over the last year: As of 2015, the thesis was: Tesla would have a multi-year time-to-market advantage in making a 200-mile range EV for $35,000. As of 2016, the thesis becomes: Tesla will be at least one full year behind GM in delivering a 200 mile range EV for $35,000. That's huge, but the story doesn't end there. GM has said very little - for this purpose practically nothing - about building a long-distance DC charging network to compete with Tesla's supercharging network. Will 2016 be the year when GM presents such a plan? That would presumably be in cooperation with other automakers. One the "regular car" front, there are five major cars entering production: Cadillac CT6. This is the sedan flagship, made in both Detroit and China. Cadillac XT5. This is the small-to-midsize SUV. Buick LaCrosse. This is the new Buick flagship sedan. Chevrolet Cruze. This is GM's best-selling small sedan. Ford just announced in December that it will be investing $4.5 billion in developing 13 electric cars by 2020 - in addition to the models already decided upon. It's not clear whether any of these models will enter production in 2016 - probably not - but perhaps before 2016 is over, we may begin to see some hints about what's in the pipeline. Ford looks ready to unveil, in its January 11 press conference, the refreshed Fusion midsize sedan, and it will of course come in a plug-in hybrid (PHEV) version - perhaps with a much-improved battery to better compete with the Chevrolet Volt 2.0. Ford is also likely to unveil, on January 5, its upgrade path to Android Auto (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) CarPlay for its infotainment system, SYNC-3, which entered production in five nameplates over the last six months. The second quarter of 2016 also brings the next version of SYNC-3, which will include an embedded 4G LTE modem so that these updates can be done, in the future, over the cellular network instead of WiFi. 2017 model year Ford Escape. This is the best-selling small SUV. Fiat-Chrysler Automobiles (NYSE: FCAU ) FCAU starts off 2016 with a long-overdue Bang! The all-new Chrysler Town & Country minivan will be introduced on January 11 and it enters production shortly thereafter. The current Dodge Caravan and Chrysler Town & Country minivans are very long in the tooth and while they continue to be practical and represent a good value, they have fallen behind the competition from Toyota (NYSE: TM ), Honda (NYSE: HMC ) and Kia in design and technology. Perhaps near the end of 2016, Chrysler will also make available the plug-in hybrid version of the Town & Country minivan, having it compete against the Tesla Model X. Of course, the Chrysler will be half the price and have a larger interior. It will also carry a normal roof rack for those who want to use one, and have no range anxiety. The doors will be proven and reliable. The fetish inside FCA right now is the return of Alfa Romeo. There's a sales target of 450,000 cars per year by 2018, which pretty much everyone looks at as pure fantasy. The first Alfa sedan model - the Giulia - is scheduled to arrive in US dealerships late 2016. I think every auto enthusiast is naturally rooting for Alfa to succeed, but I have yet to meet any auto journalist who believes it will actually be successful. What's saving FCA right now is Jeep. For the first eleven months of 2015, sales were up 23% in the US and 132% in Europe, just to mention a couple of choice geographies. With that, it seems strange that we are not seeing more new product to replace some of Jeep's aging product portfolio. The same thing goes for RAM. I think FCA should invest in order to not lose their grip on those two brands. RP: Outside of the big three, Wahlman thinks all eyes will be on Volkswagen, for two reasons. AW: The swing factor on the dieselgate scandal is huge. There are geographical differences - Europe versus USA. And there are different costs related to the physical recalls/rebuilds, as well regulatory fines and the cost of the numerous lawsuits. For starters, it will matter a lot whether the recall will mostly be a matter of a software update (as proposed for most of Europe), or whether there will be some heavier rebuild required. I can't think of a bigger headache faced by any large automobile vendor in at least a generation. Volkswagen has talked so much about its plans for various electric cars in recent months, it's hard to keep track of what constitutes the latest and greatest long-term plans. One day it's 20 models by 2018; another day it's another 20 models for 2020. So I guess that makes 40! I think I can't be blamed for any confusion here given the lack of clarity in the messaging. We obviously know that VW will introduce the new "hippie bus" (minivan) on January 5, and that it will likely enter production as early as late 2017 if all goes well. Furthermore, there is the question of whether VW will rely on privately held Kreisel for a new family of EVs that will launch by 2018, before VW's all-new electric-only platform starts production in late 2019 or 2020. Volkswagen's premium brands Audi and Porsche have been much clearer about their plans. We know the Audi crossover-SUV "eTron Quattro" will enter production by early 2018 as a fairly direct Tesla-competitor and 300 miles of range. We also know that Porsche will enter production with its four-door all-electric sports car in either 2019 or 2020. RP: Now, onto Tesla specifically, a company Wahlman follows closely and writes about most frequently on Seeking Alpha . Given that his Tesla articles trigger some of the most spirited comments' sections on SA, we challenged Wahlman on his TSLA bearishness. In particular, we wondered if electric vehicle competition even matters to Tesla, given that it knows its market (rich people on the coasts) and as long as those people remain loyal, Tesla will be the Apple of the EV world. AW: That's obviously true. But there are shades of gray here. Clearly Tesla is - today - a high-end brand and every new $35,000 car won't be considered with it. That said, there are at least three counter-arguments to that in turn: There are actually a whole bunch of people who cross-shop $30,000 and $90,000 EVs. The reason is simple, and in no ways analogous to any other car cross-shopping psyche. Someone wants an EV, perhaps to get into the carpool lane. They have the means to buy a Tesla but don't really want it - too wide, too sensitive with the aluminum, too flashy, just against spending $70,000 - $150,000 on principal, whatever. However, the $30,000 - $50,000 EV just doesn't have the range they need. So they buy the Tesla. But if the $30,000 - $50,000 had been just a little bit better (150 or 200 miles of range instead of 80 or 110), they would have gotten it instead. So in that sense, they very much compete for the buyer. Tesla is a $70,000 - $150,000 car today. But the bulk of the company's valuation comes from the promise of delivering a $35,000 car by the end of 2017. They will show it this March. I'm sure it will be beautiful. As such, it very much matters when competitors show off new $30,000 - $50,000 EVs, because they will compete head-on with Tesla, in about two years from now. And in GM's case, they're one year ahead, assuming Tesla delivers on time (They will swear they will, but in the end … you saw what happened with Model X: Two years late). The competition isn't ONLY sub-$50,000 cars. Two years from now - early 2018 - Audi will deliver the first (?) 100% head-on direct competition for Tesla, with a 300-mile range crossover. It will surely be more than $60,000, perhaps around $70,000. And then, a year after that, BMW, Mercedes, Jaguar, Infiniti, Lincoln, Jaguar Land Rover and Volvo - among others - will too. RP: So with all of this is mind, doesn't a large EV market, particularly with viable options and well-known brands in the mix, benefit Tesla? Pandora (NYSE: P ) likes to say that all of the competition it faces validates its business model. Fitbit (NYSE: FIT ) might argue (maybe it has?) that the Apple Watch is a good thing because it draws attention to wearables and, upon closer inspection, consumers will realize that Fitbit is the better choice for a health-focused smartwatch. Can't we apply the same arguments to Tesla? AW: I think there is some truth to that, but I think it's dwarfed by the other side of the equation. Increasing competition will also expose the long-term margin expectations for this business. If industry net margins are 5%, it will be increasingly difficult to base long-term Tesla projections on 10%, 15% or 20% net margins. And that's when playing against competitors who have greater scale economies. Ultimately, it comes down to profitability, not having won a profitless victory in some (small) segment of the market, prestigious as it might be. RP: You talk a lot about in-car entertainment systems. I thought Ford had an entire team of tech guys working on this. But it seems it's all about integrating somebody else's (a tech company's) platform. Do we ever get to a place where, across vehicles, there is a reliable and uniform solution? Or is it simply, I plug in my iPhone and Car Play works or I plug in my Android and Android Auto works. So the car becomes an extension of these existing operating systems we're familiar with and nothing is proprietary to the automaker? AW: This one is easy. All car companies are throwing bigger resources on this. Some very much - GM, Ford, VW/Audi and Mercedes. Others, less (FCA comes to mind), choosing instead to rely on suppliers. In the end the result will be all the same: Every car will have three buttons for the infotainment experience: The Automaker's own button, the Apple button and the Google button. The automaker needs its own "space" for things where it does not give access to Apple and Google - such as vehicle health diagnostics and management. The automaker is also likely to replicate services also offered by Apple/Google, such as maps and multimedia. Remember, Google and Apple are not nearly as strong outside the US and more or less banned to varying degrees, at least for some services, in some countries (China). You also have to be prepared for what to do if things change (BlackBerry (NASDAQ: BBRY ) exited Pakistan, perhaps India too), and perhaps some country will effectively ban Google and Apple too. You can imagine conflicts over anything from encryption to liability for all sorts of crazy things. Neither the iPhone nor Android existed 10 years ago. Automakers plan to keep these cars on the road for the next 50-100 years. They can't make their cars be dependent on what happens to Apple and Google. What if they start making their own cars and stop supporting GM, Ford, Honda or Volkswagen? So the automaker needs to retain its own safety valve, even if its consumers end up using Apple/Google most of the time - for now.
