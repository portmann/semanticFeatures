Union-Backed Campaign Asks Verizon “Where’s My FiOS?” â€“ Consumerist From the CWA’s “ Where’s My FiOS? ” flyer. For years, it’s been obvious that Verizon lacked interest in expanding its FiOS fiberoptic pay-TV and Internet service beyond its existing footprint, even though the company had not fulfilled its promises in areas like New Jersey and New York City to make high-speed broadband available to everyone. And in January, Verizon officially extinguished any hope that FiOS would be bringing competition to new markets anytime soon . But a new campaign organized by the Communications Workers of America is asking consumers to demand that Verizon deliver the service it so proudly touts on TV. The “Where’s My FiOS?” campaign points out that Verizon promised in 2008 that it would bring FiOS to all of New York City, where Time Warner Cable is by far the dominant player, by 2014. However, many parts of the city still lack access to a second option for broadband and Verizon doesn’t seem to be in any hurry to deliver. The story is no different across the Hudson River in New Jersey, where Verizon had promised — in 1993! — to bring high-speed Internet service to 100% of the state by 2010. That obviously hasn’t happened and the company recently resorted to an astroturfing campaign trying to make it look like NJ residents were just fine with their lack of options . Of course, the CWA would directly benefit from continued FiOS expansion as it would mean more work for the union’s members. Regardless of the the CWA’s underlying motive in nudging Verizon, any pressure on the company to make good on its promises and bring choices to consumers — especially those stuck with bottom-of-the-barrel Time Warner Cable service — is welcome. Verizon maintains that it has lived up to all its obligations and projections, saying that the company has exceeded its goal of making itself available to 18 million homes nationwide. However, the fact that the company is increasingly shifting its time and capital investments away from its wireline business and toward Verizon Wireless implies that you shouldn’t expect FiOS in your area if it’s not already there.
