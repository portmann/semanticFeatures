A Look At Boeing's Commercial Orders And Deliveries In September - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Despite the Chinese order for 300 aircraft, Boeing booked just a few orders in September. During the month, the company exceeded the expected number of deliveries. Boeing (NYSE: BA ) has updated its orders and deliveries overview up to and including September. In this article, I will have a look at how the order inflow and deliveries affect Boeing's target and performance. Figure 1: Boeing orders (up until) September 2015 (Source: AeroAnalysis.net ) In August, Boeing booked 52 orders, with 51 orders for its single-aisle product and 1 order for a wide-body aircraft. In September, Boeing booked 'just' 29 orders. Given the fact that Boeing announced a mega order of 300 units from China, it becomes evident that it takes time for an already announced order to end up in the order book. For the Chinese order, I expect that the orders will end up in the order book by the year end. During September, Boeing booked orders for 27 narrow-body aircraft and 2 wide-body aircraft valued at $3.1 bn. AeroAnalysis expects the market value to be closer to $1.5 bn. Jet2 finalized an order for 27 Boeing 737-800 Next Generation aircraft with a catalogue value of $2.6bn. An unidentified customer ordered 2 Boeing 787-9 airframes with a catalogue value of $529 mln. Despite Boeing's order inflow being quite low in the last 2 months, I do expect the order inflow to increase in the coming months due to the orders placed by Chinese companies and carriers being finalized. While the number of orders tells something about the attractiveness of the product a manufacturer offers and the long-term prospects for the manufacturer, for short-term investors, deliveries are more interesting to look at. Since most of the cash comes in after delivering an airframe, it is important to meet the targeted number of deliveries in order to achieve the forecasted cash flow. Figure 2: Boeing deliveries (up until) September 2015 (Source: AeroAnalysis) Boeing's delivery of 77 airframes exceeded expectations. Deliveries were a mix of narrow-body aircraft (70%) and wide-body aircraft (30%). The estimated market value of the deliveries is $6.0bn. After lower-than-expected deliveries in August, Boeing delivered 9 airframes more than expected. Deliveries for the Boeing 747 and Boeing 777 were in line with expectations. Deliveries for the Boeing 777 exceeded expectations by 3 units Deliveries for the Boeing 787 were 1 unit above expectation Whereas Boeing's deliveries for its narrow-body family was slightly below expectation in the previous month, the jet maker now exceeded the total number of expected deliveries in the last 2 months. This resulted in a strong delivery number that should show in Boeing's cash flow. During September, Boeing booked 29 orders and delivered 77 units, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of .37. For the full year, this ratio is .87 (excluding order cancellations). Boeing's full-year target is to receive 1 order for each delivery. So Boeing still has to add some orders to the order book to achieve its desired book-to-bill ratio. Order inflow in September was at the lowest point since January 2015. With 77 deliveries in September, the number of deliveries exceeded expectations. Boeing exceeded its delivery target for the Dreamliner for the full year. After a strong September, I expect Boeing to meet its delivery target for the full year. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
