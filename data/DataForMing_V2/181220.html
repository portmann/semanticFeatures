Friday 9/25 Only: Amazon Prime for 30% Off, $67 a Year â€” My Money Blog September 23, 2015 By Jonathan Ping Leave a Comment Amazon has announced a promotion for over 30% off their Amazon Prime service : Celebrate Transparent winning 5 Emmy Awards with a $32 savings.  On Friday, September 25, from 12:00am ET to 11:59pm PT, we are offering new members a special price of $67 (normally $99) for the first year of Prime. New members: Buy Amazon Prime for $67 a year on Friday, 9/25 . Existing Prime members: I don’t know if it will work this time, but see if they will let you buy $67 Prime Gift subscriptions on Friday .   First of all, not a bad gift idea.   Even better, gift subscriptions of Prime don’t expire, so you can save them to sign yourself up again after your current subscription runs out.   Just be sure to let your current Prime subscription actually end first by turning off auto-renewals in your settings.  You will click on “End Membersip” and then “End Later” on your anniversary date. After having kids, I must admit that I got addicted to Amazon Prime.   Less need to drive anywhere with free shipping, free eBooks with Kindle Owners’ Lending Library, and Sesame Street streaming at any hour. My classic Kindle is getting pretty old, so I’m thinking of picking up their new loss-leader $50 Kindle Fire as my new e-Reader. You can only read the free Kindle Owners’ Lending Library book on a “real” Kindle, not just their Kindle app. Notify me of follow-up comments by email.
