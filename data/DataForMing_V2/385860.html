Verizon earnings meet estimates; strike poised to hurt current quarter | Reuters Verizon Communications Inc said profit in the first quarter met expectations as strong tablet sales helped it add new subscribers, though an ongoing strike by its wireline workers was expected to hurt earnings in the current quarter. Still, the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier stood by its full-year profit forecast. The company said in January that 2016 adjusted earnings would be at a level comparable to 2015. Verizon's shares were down 2.5 percent in premarket trading on Thursday. About 40,000 employees of Verizon's wireline business, which includes FiOS Internet, telephone and TV services, went on strike on April 13, after reaching an impasse in talks over a new labor contract. Issues include healthcare, offshoring call center jobs, temporary job relocations and pensions. In the wireline business, consumer revenue of $4 billion was relatively unchanged from a year ago. Verizon has been scaling back its Fios TV and Internet business, which represented about 29 percent of Verizon's 2015 revenue. To tap new revenue, the company has shifted its focus to wireless and the advertising-supported Internet business and acquired AOL last June for $4.4 billion. It is seen as the front-runner in bidding for Yahoo Inc's core Internet business. The company, known for its high-quality network, is locked in a battle for subscribers with competitors in the saturated U.S. wireless market. Smaller rival Sprint Corp has been offering half-off discounts to encourage users to switch to its network, and T-Mobile US Inc has launched free music and video-streaming plans. The company reported strong subscriber net additions for the first quarter ended March 31, adding 640,000 wireless retail postpaid subscribers, helped by tablet promotions during a seasonally slow period for phone upgrades. That was well above analysts' average estimate of 480,000, according to market research firm FactSet StreetAccount. Customer defections, known as churn, in Verizon's wireless postpaid business, dipped to 0.96 percent from 1.03 percent a year earlier. Total operating revenue rose 0.6 percent to $32.17 billion, falling short of analysts' average estimate of $32.46 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income attributable to the company rose to $4.31 billion, or $1.06 per share, in the first quarter, from $4.22 billion, or $1.02 per share, a year earlier.
