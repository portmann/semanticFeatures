Microsoft: Skype For Business Update Puts It Back In The Video-Calling Conversation - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft is out with an update to its Skype app - this time an SMB/enterprise focused update. I believe video calling to be one of the "next big things" in tech - a grossly under served and under developed market that is low hanging fruit for capture. Video calling could and should lead to substantial increases to retention, cross selling and potentially new line sales of hardware for the spatial winners. Microsoft, of course having a "one-platform" goal as its primary strategic initiative, understands this and is making Skype a focus for the future. In mid-August I put out a tech industry note observing that Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) had spun-off Hangouts to a stand-alone app-site and what it meant for the broader Google platform. I also commented on what it meant for one of the "next big things" in tech, which I firmly believe is the capture of the video-calling market. Yes, the now aged video-calling market. I believe that the capture of video-calling market share will be one of the major drivers of tech valuation over the next several years - especially for tech platforms that can cater to non-consumer markets. I tried to explain this in long-form within my Google note and I tried to do this by detailing how Google is highly focused, rightly so I believe, on furthering its Google for Work efforts by building out its video calling capacity. Google, I think clearly evidenced by the Hangouts app-site spinoff, shares my thinking in how important this service is going to be in the future. Put simply, I believe that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Google, and/or Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) by getting to this market first can substantially lock in a massive user base (and my focus will be on non-consumer in this note) that can also drive cross platform selling efforts. Apparently, Microsoft also agrees with me in finally launching its Skype for Business app. The video-calling vertical of the general "productivity" niche for SMB/enterprises is currently a mess. Solutions like Google's Hangouts, Microsoft's prior Skype (consumer) and Lync (largely SMB/enterprise), Apple's FaceTime, Citrix Systems' (NASDAQ: CTXS ) GoToMeeting, etc., all work but none are ideally set up for non-consumer, high traffic use. All have obvious problems. The problems, by the way, run the full spectrum of the imagination - I'm sure many are familiar with the list. Hangouts (my current favorite)? Lag time and call quality even on a good connection. Skype? Username required, antiquated user interface, not widely used enough. FaceTime? Branded device limitations and pretty much limited to consumer use-cases. GoToMeeting? Really difficult to get non-tech familiar (read: older) users to 1) access, 2) use, 3) become comfortable with the platform. All of these issues can be overcome individually and most SMBs/enterprises I know that deploy video-calling often enough are using multiple solutions as a "comprehensive solution." But is that really the way this service should exist? Can you see why disrupting the status quo might offer significant customer acquisition (among other benefits like cross selling)? As noted above, apparently Google and Microsoft can. Skype for Business will have all the features of the old platform but with the additions of enhanced security, integrations with Microsoft's Active Directory, updated dashboard features, a better user interface (more easily accessible and highly visible features), and productivity suite access (read: PowerPoint and other Office application usage - this will be made available in an update to come soon). Basically, this puts Skype for Business on-par with Hangouts from a tech capacity/use case standpoint. When Microsoft updates Skype for Business to be inclusive of the productivity suite access, this will then become my go-to video app. That's going to be a game changer for me. This also is the next important evolution of video chat to pay very close attention to - the buildout of cross sell capacity. Again, this is where the monetization is going to be had and this is where I believe all the valuation addition will be created. The actual video calling app buildouts taking place aren't going to do much for the companies building them out. I mean, monetizing the app via ad space? I don't think so. Where the money will be made for the companies investing in the platforms is in retaining users within a broader product ecosystem and in cross selling productivity within the app itself. Microsoft is another great example (Google's scenario has been detailed in my prior note). Microsoft, by integrating the rest of its productivity suite into its video-calling platform, can then use the video-calling platform as a sales tool in several ways. It can use Skype for Business because of the ability to present PowerPoint's/Excel files/Power BI dashboards/etc. as a way to sell the other platforms integrated. This, I believe, is going to be a huge driver for Microsoft in that it owns such a large part of the SMB/enterprise productivity market from a software standpoint. It's software being the "base platform" for how so many businesses do business that should open the door for "same ecosystem" usage of Skype for Business and vice versa. This is as defensive from a retention and ecosystem capture/trap standpoint as it's offensive in securing new market share. Rather than using GoToMeeting and using the "Show Your Screen" (which has plenty of issues and imperfections) function users can simply use Skype for Business and have the presentations "pushed" to their screen in full viewing (presumably with less lag/delay/friction) within the app. Microsoft can use Skype for Business as way to sell hardware - for instance using its Surface Pro, Surface Book or coming Surface Hub as fully comprehensive (inclusive of video-calling capacity) productivity devices that can help change business outcomes - especially with the productivity suite and video-calling capacity being tailor built for the device. This is a market that Apple is just now trying to enter with its newest iteration of the iPad, which is being built with non-consumer use cases in mind. The list goes on and on. The bottom line here, and really it's the bottom line for the video-calling market in general, is that solving the video-calling problem would allow Microsoft to unlock user value in terms of its broader product and software ecosystem. This, of course, is the stated primary strategic initiative at Microsoft currently - hence why the company is focusing on video-calling capacity buildout. Video-calling in my opinion is the way of the future and is low hanging fruit for the companies that want to make it a focus. We now have the technological capacity, telecom capacity included, to make video calling the new primary option of communication (when applicable) for non-consumer use and those that have the ancillary ecosystems to make it worth pursuing (like Microsoft and Google - Apple is coming along) will benefit immensely from doing just that. Stay tuned for updates in the video-calling solution and market capture race. Good luck everybody. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
