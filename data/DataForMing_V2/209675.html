Apple Fiscal 2015 Should Be Strong, But Lagging Sales Might Put A Damper On Q1 2016 - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Blockbuster launch weekend but not much follow through. We always get a massive amount of hype every time a new iPhone is launched - photos of rain-drenched enthusiasts who have camped out for days to be among the first to buy the device. I wonder how historians will record this phenomenon, or perhaps when the iPhone 99 comes out there will still be throngs of buyers lined up outside Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Stores clambering to buy a new iPhone. Of course this year included China, which added to the launch weekend sales and fueled even more hype. Amidst all the hype, investors are left with the daunting task of trying to figure out whether the trend is continuing north or rolling over. Some data points are useful, but by no means determinative. Fiksu.com publishes its now-famous trackers among which is the iPhone launch comparison. In the 15 days since launch, how does the uptake of new iPhones look? I'm afraid the Apple Fans may be a bit let down by the data. The iPhone 6s represents 2.3% of iPhones in use at this point, behind the 3.8% turned in last year when the iPhone 6 was launched, and the iPhone 6s Plus (what a terrible name for anything) not much better, from 1% of iPhones in use last year to 0.7% this time. At least one analyst at Citi has cut his forecast for Apple's Q4, calling for iPhone sales of 47 million units. If so, that would be a drop from 47.5 million in the June quarter but still a healthy rise from 39.3 million in fiscal Q4 2014. Those are not alarming data, and Apple should turn in a solid quarter. For fiscal 2015 as a whole, I foresee iPhone sales of somewhere close to 230 million. At an average selling price of somewhere around $650 that results in a whopping $143 billion in iPhone sales in a single year. Given reasonable performance from Apple's other lines which is generally expected, Apple should have a record year with sales over $230 billion and net profit around $9.00 per share. Since my estimates are by and large in line with what I see elsewhere on the street, I expect little stock price reaction to the report when it's issued later this month. Guidance will be the key to any material move in the stock with investors closely watching management's expectations for the key Christmas quarter. Early signs are that iPhone sales in China are lagging expectations . A similar picture is emerging in Japan , another key Apple market, where observers report sales running 15% below the iPhone 6 level of 2014. Sales in North America are reportedly 10% lower than 2014. China, Japan and the United States are key iPhone markets which together make up more than 70% of Apple's revenues . Softness in key markets will be hard to offset. In summary, fiscal 2015 should be a banner year for Apple. Whether Apple can follow that growth in Q1 2016 remains to be seen. I'm doubtful and remain short the name. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information. We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.
