Apple's Stock Price Correlates Well With A Key Metric - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha I’ll show how Apple’s stock price is likely to move going forward. The stock price will be further supported by an attractive valuation. I found that Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) stock tends to correlate well with EPS growth over the long term. By focusing on expected EPS, investors can take some of the emotion out of investing to determine how the stock is likely to move over the long term. We can see from the chart above that Apple's stock price has increased approximately in-line with earnings growth over the past 10 years. I expect that correlation to continue going forward as investors place a strong value on the company's bottom line. Another interesting observation is how Apple's stock overshot to the downside in late 2012 into 2013 as compared to EPS growth. The large discrepancy demonstrates that the stock was quite a bargain at the bottom of that correction. That correction resulted from fears that the gross margin would drop significantly. However, that theory did not materialize as Apple has maintained a high gross margin over the long term. As Apple continues to increase earnings, its operating cash flow and free cash flow also continue to increase. Since Apple is now rewarding investors with its free cash flow in the form of dividends and share repurchases, the stock has now become a dividend growth investment. Dividend growth companies tend to perform well over the long term, so I expect Apple to perform well based on its strong earnings growth. Apple has a tendency to exceed the consensus estimates, so I think that the company's performance will be slightly better than the estimates shown from Nasdaq and Yahoo! Finance. For my estimates, I took the average of the consensus estimates from both Nasdaq and Yahoo! Finance and added a conservative 5%. I say conservative because Apple exceeded its estimates by an average of 9.5% for the past four quarters. Apple's valuation is likely to remain below the average S&P 500 company because technology changes so rapidly. Apple investors don't give the stock price too high a valuation because they want to see how each iPhone upgrade sells. Apple investors tend to have a wait and see approach to new product releases. For example, when the iPod and iPhone were first released, the stock traded in a sideways range before breaking out to new highs. The breakout in the stock resulted from the sales and earnings figures from those products in the months after each release. So, it is likely that the same thing is happening with the release of the Apple Watch. Investors don't hit the buy button on the stock just because a new product has been launched. They have a 'show me the money' type attitude and wait for concrete sales figures to be released. Since demand has exceeded Apple's supply of watches , I would expect sales of the Apple Watch to be strong. When these figures are released, the stock is likely to increase at a strong pace. Stronger sales will lead to earnings growth, which will drive the stock higher due to the correlation between the stock price and earnings growth. With that in mind, Apple is currently trading at only 13.4X next year's expected earnings. This is about 24% below the valuation of the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA: SPY ), which is trading at 17.6X next year's expected earnings. Apple is expected to increase earnings by over 13% annually over the next few years as compared to the S&P 500's 10.7% annual growth over the same period. Therefore, with a lower valuation and higher earnings growth, I expect Apple's stock to outperform the broader market going forward. I'm projecting Apple's stock price to increase to about $250 over approximately the next five years. This takes my average annual earnings growth projection of 14.26% for the next five years into consideration. The price projection also takes into consideration that the P/E will remain relatively constant over this time period.
