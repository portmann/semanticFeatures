Neil Cybart On Apple: What Can Investors Expect From WWDC 2015 And Beyond? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha What can Apple observers expect from WWDC? Look for iOS updates, more details on the watch and news on a renewed video/music effort. Apple will look to expand the iPhone into new markets and continue to take share away from Android. WWDC takes place next week. The big Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) event, which brings together developers working on various programs under the Apple brand, is a big deal for the company, as it's typically a platform for launching new products and services. It's expected that Apple will unveil a new video/TV effort. There will be key updates for iOS. More details on the Apple Watch could be shared with attendees. No matter what comes out of the conference, talk about the event during the past few weeks has captured the attention of those who closely watch the company. That includes Neil Cybart, a Seeking Alpha contributor who runs Above Avalon, a site dedicated to analysis and commentary on Apple. Neil started his career as a Wall Street stock analyst, covering the financial sector for seven years. In 2014, he started Above Avalon, feeling there was a lack of relevant Apple analysis from both a financial and business point of view. Along with producing fundamental and financial research on Apple, Neil writes a blog covering the company, content for which can be found here . Neil spent some time answering questions about the latest developments at Apple and what to expect from WWDC when it kicks off June 8. The following are observations he shared with Seeking Alpha Editor Michael Hopkins. Seeking Alpha: What could we see from WWDC in terms of something new from the company? Neil Cybart: It is important to remember the primary audience for an event like WWDC is iOS developers. As a result, one should expect updates to iOS and OS X. Even though early rumors had suggested minor updates to both iOS and OS X, I still think we can be in store for some surprises. Jeff Williams told us at the Re/code conference that Apple also will be previewing the SDK for native Apple Watch apps. We are likely going to see Apple unveil its new streaming music service, along with an updated Apple TV box and possibly a new SDK for Apple TV. It remains to be seen if Apple will announce a new video streaming service or if that will be announced later this year. Updates to other services like Apple Pay and ResearchKit also are expected. I would not be surprised to see some new things that, similar to last year, have not been discussed in the press. SA: You recently stated that Apple is working on something big in R&D . Are we likely to see something from WWDC from these efforts, or is the R&D push more of a long-term development? NC: Apple has been a very consistent R&D spender, reporting increased R&D expenditures each year since 1998, with sequential quarterly declines in R&D spending in only six out of the past 38 quarters. Starting last summer, Apple's R&D expenditures began to increase at a much faster pace than ever before. I look at such an increase as likely related to work on battery, telematics and autonomous driving initiatives related to personal transport. While I am sure some of the new products that are expected to be unveiled at WWDC were at one time classified as R&D expense, once a project's commercial viability has been established, it becomes that much more difficult to classify manufacturing or evolutionary product updates as R&D expense. I suspect most of Apple's R&D is related to products in the 3-5 year pipeline. SA: How does Apple's R&D spending compare to other tech companies? Maybe the company can do more? Less? Or is the spending just right? NC: R&D expense is not created equally. Apple spends less on R&D than its peers primarily because it has a functional organizational structure and product-focused culture. This leads to the company placing fewer bets than other companies, although each bet tends to be large and riskier. Apple R&D tends to be very focused with clear agendas. SA: The big new product is - of course - the Apple Watch. Why are new products, like Apple Watch, important? NC: The Apple Watch represents Apple's newest product category and judging from the limited data we have on early demand trends, it would seem that sales are much stronger when compared to other wearables in the market. In terms of "big new products," the new iPhones that will be announced later this year will have a much bigger impact on Apple's business. Apple wants to change the world and to accomplish that, they need to keep thinking about how to move society forward and foster change. New products help Apple succeed with that mission. A company afraid of change is a company that will likely fade into the shadow as time goes on. SA: The iPhone - of course - is the flagship product. Could Apple put itself into a long-term challenging situation given the dominance of the product on the bottom line? NC: Apple's long-term challenge is coming up with new products that change the world. The iPhone's success may actually provide benefits to Apple in the form of a much larger, and loyal, user base that would be positioned as future buyers of such new products. I don't think management worries too much about iPhone's growing share of revenues and profits because they have demonstrated the need to continue thinking of the next big thing and not get caught up on prior or current success. SA: Is the iPhone vulnerable? Competition and innovation in the smartphone space continue to impress consumers and those in the tech industry. NC: The iPhone is a result of not just luck, but also years of refined engineering, R&D, superb business strategy, and good timing. The iPhone is much more resilient than most analysts and pundits assume. Apple has spent years building up the iPhone's competitive advantages in addition to understanding consumers masterfully in terms of not over-serving them with features. As seen with the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, Apple continues to ship the most popular phones in the market, and I look at management's future iPhone pricing strategy, not increased competition from other market players, as the primary determent when looking at future market share. SA: What new or emerging markets can Apple tap to expand its business? Not only geographic markets (such as China - which is the next question) but other sectors, such as enterprise or (even) automobiles? NC: Apple still has growth in iPhone primarily from geographic expansion and appealing to Android and feature phone users. In terms of future products and sectors, there are a number of areas in which Apple can expand, but I think wearables and automobiles are the two current areas of focus with the largest potential. SA: How important is China? And how important can this market become for the company? NC: With approximately 650 million 3G/4G subscribers (and an additional 650 million 2G subscribers), China is Apple's most important country, and that will likely remain true for the foreseeable future. SA: Among our readers and contributors, the big debate after the April earnings release is whether the company should've provided a bigger-than-expected increase for its dividend vs. the share buyback program. Does it matter what the company does in terms of returning capital to shareholders? NC: There are differences between share repurchases, quarterly cash dividends and special one-time dividends. Apple has shown the willingness to take advantage of Apple's stock valuation by focusing primarily on the share buyback, although cash dividends will total approximately $11 billion in FY2015. Apple simply doesn't need $194 billion of cash and while many people who don't understand Apple may argue that the company should spend the money on M&A, such a strategy would result in failure. SA: A majority of Apple's cash is tied up overseas. Could this become a long-term headache for the company, especially given the effort to return capital to shareholders? NC: Apple's capital return program is hindered by having approximately 90% of cash overseas. Management is actually buying back shares at the fastest pace it can maintain when considering its U.S. free cash flow generation and debt issuances. Apple will likely look to position its business so that a larger portion of its foreign cash can be used for organic growth and investment. In the near-term, I suspect Apple will continue to raise debt in an effort to offset the growing foreign cash pile. Source: Neil Cybart On Apple: What Can Investors Expect From WWDC 2015 And Beyond?
