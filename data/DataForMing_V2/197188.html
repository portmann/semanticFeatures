Disney: Q3 2015 Buy - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Disney has been a long-term performer for investors, delivering a strong return on investment. Recent earnings appear to throw up questions around cable network business. Disney owns valuable content franchises that will always earn a premium price. I am developing a passive income stream from dividends to generate financial independence. I'm proceeding down the path of steadily accumulating a set of high-quality, dividend-paying stocks. My strategy is quarterly accumulation of 30 stocks through a low-cost brokerage, with a few thousand dollars invested across all these stocks at a time. Disney (NYSE: DIS ) is one of the businesses in my dividend portfolio that I am accumulating. I started accumulating Disney in very small amounts in mid 2014 as part of my accumulation strategy. Most recently, I purchased the stock as part of my dividend accumulation portfolio in July 2015. I'm very interested in generating a sustainable long-term income stream, therefore I want solid dividend growth prospects. Disney offers a dividend yield of just under 1.75%. The company has seen a dividend growth rate of almost 15% annually over the last 25 years, according to longrundata.com. The stock has a long-term track record of delivering excellent returns for its investors. In fact, a $10,000 investment in DIS made in 1970 would be worth $2.46M today, This reflects a return over time of just under 13% annually. Disney's unique content franchises and customer loyalty creates a strong moat that competitors are unable to breach. Disney's recently reported revenue and earnings were a widely perceived as a disappointment by the market. Q3 2015 revenues were up 5% year on year to $13.1B, while net income for the quarter was up 11% year on year to $2.5B. In terms of segment performance, Studio Entertainment had a particularly strong quarter, with revenue growth up almost 13% year on year, while interactive revenues tumbled, some 22% year on year. What was particularly notable for the quarter was the relatively poor performance of ESPN, which was estimated to have lost some 3.2M subscribers over 2014 by Nielsen. Disney derives a significant amount of revenue from the affiliate fees which are paid to it by broadcasters such as Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) (NASDAQ: CMCSK ), which is a function that is partly based on the number of subscribers for Disney content and packages. With millennial viewers increasingly preferring other forms of content and entertainment such as Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), Buzzfeed and Vice, the viability of affiliate fees as a long term source of revenue for Disney is open to question. In addition, broadcasters such as Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) are introducing skinny bundles into the market which often don't feature Disney content. If these lower cost, "skinny bundles" become more popular, they may jeopardize Disney's long term affiliate revenues from cable. It will be interesting to see how Disney responds to this secular shift that appears to be taking place in the market. As the owner of some premium, exclusive content franchises, I believe that it owns some very valuable properties. The company may need to look at partnerships with emerging venues of distribution and consider alternate business models, but Disney's content will likely always command a premium in the market given it is unique and differentiated. Disney's virtuous cycle provides a solid moat Excluding Disney broadcasting assets, the key to its success, in my opinion, is the successful identification and development of a continuing stable of character franchises. These characters then get run through a virtuous cycle of consumer products, games and figurines, inclusion in theme parks and then their own debut on the big screen via studio entertainment. To get an idea of just how successful this model is, consider that Disney now owns more than 8 franchises with sales exceeding $1B. Mickey Mouse, Winnie the Pooh, Star Wars, Monsters, Spider-Man, Cars, Disney Jr. and the Princesses account for more than $1B each in sales volume. Each successful character franchise reinforces the success of the Disney moat. It means a new set of characters to take through the company's fixed cost production and marketing activities in game and figurine production and movie development. It's another set of characters to add value to existing theme parks, giving users yet another reason to visit. As long as Disney can continue to either organically develop new franchises, or acquire them at reasonable cost, it will continue to have long-term success. As a result of market concern over Disney's recent earnings, Disney appears to be trading at a valuation that looks compelling. Disney currently trades at a P/E ratio of 21 and a forward P/E ratio of just over 18.7. Disney is trading slightly above average multiples over the last 5 years including price to earnings and price to sales. Morningstar rates Disney stock at 4 stars at present. Disney stock has risen since I first started my accumulation. My first couple of purchases were done at $88. My November 2014 purchase was done at $91.50, my March 2015 purchase was done at $106.50. My purchase in June was done at $111. My most recent purchase was done at $119. Disney currently trades near $105. This is a great business that I intend to keep accumulating every quarter.
