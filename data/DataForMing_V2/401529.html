Apple's Latest Threat: Huawei - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Huawei has emerged as the number one smartphone brand in China. Huawei is nipping at Apple's heels in the United States and Europe. China is the world's largest smartphone market. Tim Cook believes it is one of Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) most important markets. But Apple is getting its clock cleaned in China by a handful of Chinese smartphone manufacturers led by Huawei. More importantly, Huawei is right on Apple's tail in Western Europe as well as globally. In China in particular, Apple ranks fifth behind the four key Chinese players, and with the exception of Xiaomi (Private: XI ), whose growth seems to have stalled a bit of late, are growing smartly. Vivo, Oppo and Huawei sported growth rates in the first quarter of 2016 in the 50 to 70% range while Apple simply lost ground with a decline of about 15% in shipments. Huawei's assault on Apple is not based solely on lower cost smartphones, but like Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) is based on outspending Apple on research and development. Looking at the smartphone market globally, Samsung has held volume and Huawei has expanded rapidly while Apple has just held its volume year over year. While Huawei shipments seem small beside Apple, Huawei's rapid rate of growth suggests Apple needs to take this competitor seriously. Source: Gartner as reported by Android authority Apple has lost market share in part because of the increasing cost of the already expensive iPhone. Huawei has also increased its average selling prices, but has managed to expand share while doing so largely by introducing more premium models that rival the best Apple has to offer. The iPhone 6s, Samsung S7 and Huawei P9 are top of the line smartphones with speed and camera functions more or less on par with one another. One major difference between both the Samsung S7 and the Huawei P9 and the iPhone 6s is battery life. In a Techradar test after 2 hours of use, the iPhone battery is pretty well dead with 22% battery charge remaining while the Samsung S7 is still 48% charged and the Huawei P9 has 43% battery left. Battery life has long been a bugbear for iPhone users with Samsung's famous " wall huggers " ads taking advantage. Leave for work at 8:00 a.m. and by the time the morning meeting is over at 10:30 a.m., your iPhone is dead. The whole concept of "mobile" as applied to smartphones is the ability to connect while away from a power source. In that area, the iPhone's limited battery life is a liability. As I predicted a couple of years back, Apple's growth was likely to be dampened by serious competition not only from lower-priced smartphones but also from simply better smartphones. That has now taken place. As a result, I believe the future for Apple and its iPhone is unlikely to please Apple investors. It is time to face reality and cash out.
