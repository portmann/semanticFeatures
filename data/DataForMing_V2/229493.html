3 Of Apple's Best Podcasts - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha What are the best podcasts for investors on Apple iTunes? Here are some of my favorites based on my experiences on air. As the name indicates, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iTunes is primarily for music; however, it is also growing as a home to value investing podcasts. For investors in search of an edge, what are the best podcasts with an investment focus? Three of my favorites are Micro Cap Investing , Investor in the Family , and our new Rangeley Capital Weekly Podcasts . So when you see someone enjoying iTunes, they may well be learning about investing… It's not given to human beings to have such talent that they can just know everything about everything all the time. But it is given to human beings who work hard at it - who look and sift the world for a misplaced bet - that they can occasionally find one. This podcast is hosted by Fred Rockwell and Nate Tobik . I admire both men and have learned a lot from them through the years. Fred runs Tarsier Capital and Nate founded CompleteBankData.com . They also host the MicroCap Conference which I recently attended. I was a recent guest on this podcast. The questions were great and we had fun discussing ideas with fellow value investors. This podcast is hosted by Brian Bain who also writes for Seeking Alpha. He focuses on solar, technology, and natural gas. I enjoyed our conversation about investing and hope that you might too. Before you listen to this podcast, be forewarned that this is for entertainment purposes only. Nothing you hear is an offer or a solicitation to buy or sell any investment. So, if you think you are being entertained: you are correct. If you think you are being offered investing advice: you are so wrong. If you missed last week's episode, then please check out Is Nothing Sacred? Rangeley Podcast #2 . We discussed a fund that goes anywhere and does anything. This week, we discuss Diamonds Are BS and debate the merits of blowing one's savings on highly compressed coal. Then we debate whether something can have value if you can't subsequently buy or sell it with ease. This week's topic is not just a discussion subject, it is an intervention. This is a subject near to my heart. I hope that listeners enjoy it and I hope that you find it convincing. You will be able to seriously impress people with the force of your logic by not buying them diamonds. The podcast is hosted by Andrew Walker and Chris DeMuth Jr., two Rangeley Capital portfolio managers. You can follow us on Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) ( Andrew and Chris ).
