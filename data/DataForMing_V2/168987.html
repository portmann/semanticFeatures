Disney to begin building two 'Star Wars' theme park areas in 2016 - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha To screen ETFs by asset class, performance, yield and more, check out the ETF Hub. ETF Hub Sep 10 2015, 20:11 ET | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Walt Disney ( DIS +0.7%) will break ground on two 14-acre Star Wars-themed lands -- one at Disneyland, another at its Hollywood Studios resort in Orlando, Fla. -- in 2016, earlier than expected, says COO Thomas Staggs. Those are the biggest single-theme expansions in Disney's history. Opening dates are still undetermined, though Disney's tax deal with Anaheim meant it needed to start building at least $1B in new attractions there by the end of 2017. As the company said at its D23 expo in August, the areas will include re-creations of the films' iconic Millennium Falcon spacecraft and guests will be able to "take the controls."
