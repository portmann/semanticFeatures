Southwest Airlines: The Benefits Of Buying New Aircraft With Largest Discounts - Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) | Seeking Alpha LUV's current backlog implies an average purchase discount of 65% compared to the manufacturer's list prices, which is materially more than in case of AAL, DAL and UAL. LUVâ€™s cheap orders from Boeing should translate into total savings worth $3.8â€“$6.4 billion compared to the other three major US airlines. These above-average discounts should eventually increase the annual net income by between $80 and $135 million compared to its peers depending on the realization of LUVâ€™s purchase options. Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV ) has a rather long history of trading at premium compared to the other major US airlines. The present situation is similar as LUV's current P/E ratio (11.5) materially exceeds the P/E ratios of its main competitors. For example, American Airlines (NASDAQ: AAL ) now trade at 2.5 times earnings, Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL ) at 6.0 and United Continental (NYSE: UAL ) at 2.0. The comparison of additional multiples such as EV/EBITDA or P/B within this group would yield corresponding results. When justifying this premium, most analysts and investors mention LUV's superior growth prospects, lower leverage, remarkable historical performance or exceptional resilience during the past airline crises (relatively to the other major US carriers). Nevertheless, I am convinced that few investors have thoroughly analyzed LUV's aircraft acquisition strategy and especially the associated pricing. In order to obtain aircraft, airlines can resort to two options: purchases or leasing. Despite being very popular in emerging markets, aircraft leasing is less favored by the domestic legacy carriers. Out of 3189 aircraft operated by AAL, DAL, LUV and UAL in the first quarter of 2016, only 975 were leased (31%) and the remaining portion (69%) of the fleet was owned by the carriers. It must be noted that owning this number of depreciating aircraft is not cheap. In fact, when looking at the Q1 2016 results of the four leading US carriers, it turns out that depreciation equaled to 5.9 % of all operating expenses and aircraft maintenance added another 5.6%. Although small changes of these percentages might not seem significant, investors need to realize that the industry's net margin in Q1 2016 (7.8%) was well above long-term average typical for the major US airlines. For instance, the same margin averaged a mere 3.2% between 2012 and 2014. Because major legacy carriers operate in an inherently low-margin and high-leverage business with little pricing power, even relatively small, but long-term decreases of operating expense can have a material effect on the long-term stock price. Purchasing aircraft is a complex and non-transparent business. Although aircraft manufacturers publish standardized list prices for each model on a yearly basis, the actual transaction rates tend to be considerably lower. According to insiders, the usual realized prices are equal to approximately 50% of the official list figures. In my opinion, the main reason why manufacturers artificially inflate the official numbers is that purchase deposits are primarily determined as a fixed fraction of the list prices. Increasing official rates hence improves manufacturers' cash flows. Despite being worth around 50% in general, the discounts do materially differ depending on the specific order. The main reasons behind this variance are the value of the whole order, the type of the purchased aircraft and the time of the order (earlier orders can usually secure larger discounts). However, determining the exact extent of the discounts is a challenging task for investors. Major airlines and aircraft manufacturers only disclose the nominal values of announced orders derived from the official rates. However, the real purchase prices and discounts can sometimes be estimated. All 4 major US carriers disclose their order books as of the end of each year and 3 of them also disclose the value of all future aircraft purchase commitments. UAL is the only exception, as it does not explicitly disclose aircraft purchase commitments - it only publishes capital purchase obligations, which include spare engines and information technology as well. The following table summarizes the order books of these airlines and the standard list prices. Combining these two pieces of information, I have calculated the values of these orders as measured by the official list rates. Then I have estimated the future book value of the ordered aircraft by using the total contractual aircraft commitments as stated in the last annual report. In case of UAL, I have assumed that capital purchase obligations are solely composed of aircraft purchase commitments, as I have been unable to find any further breakdown of this figure. According to this calculation, the average discounts to the list prices are 52% in case of AAL, 59% in case of DAL and 65% in case of LUV. It is rather difficult to interpret the implied UAL's discount of 42%. The capital purchase obligations disclosed by UAL probably also include significant commitments related to spare engines and information technology, thus increasing the estimated book value of future aircraft purchases and decreasing the expected discount. UAL's estimated 42% discount seems to be unrealistically low given that the size of its backlog and the types of ordered aircraft are comparable to the other three major US carriers. However, the analysis becomes more interesting when we contemplate the implied superior discounts of LUV. This company pursues a strategy, which is unique among the leading US airlines - its fleet and order book include solely one type of aircraft (Boeing (NYSE: BA ) 737). In fact, the order book only consisted of 89 Boeing 737-800 orders, 30 Boeing 737 MAX 7 orders and 170 Boeing 737 MAX 8 orders as of the end of Q1. Moreover, the company had options to acquire additional 18 Boeing 737-800 aircraft and 191 Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft. Obviously, the orders of new Boeing 737 MAX are most significant. From the international perspective, LUV is currently among the three leading purchasers of the new Boeing 737 MAX family along with Lion Air, and most recently, Ryanair (NASDAQ: RYAAY ). All of them have ordered approximately 200 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. Other airlines or aircraft leasing companies with largest Boeing 737 MAX orders have committed to acquire "only" around 100 of these aircraft (such as American Airlines, United Airlines, Air Lease, AerCap or Viajet). Furthermore, LUV has excellent business relationships with Boeing as it has purchased a huge number of aircraft from this manufacturer during the past few decades. In addition to the huge size of the Boeing 737 MAX order, LUV also ordered the new model as the first major airline in 2011. The first actual delivery of the Boeing 737 MAX ever will be to LUV in the first half of 2017. Because of ordering the new aircraft very early and in massive numbers, LUV has very probably received a significant discount and this discount has been larger than in case of its main US competitors. Since almost 70% of the LUV's firm orders consist of the Boeing 737 MAX, the discount on these aircraft is the decisive driver behind the overall order book discount. However, we can assume that LUV has also managed to negotiate favorable terms on the remaining orders (89 Boeing 737-800s) because of LUV's outstanding business relationships with Boeing and its long-standing track record of buying Boeing 737s. The savings from the cheap acquisition of the new aircraft have not materialized in any of LUV's financial statements yet. The obvious reason is that these transactions (delivering the aircraft) have yet to happen. I believe that the most sensible means of estimating the total savings from the cheap purchase is predicting the difference between the total amount to be paid by LUV for its order book and its standard market value. The amount to be paid by LUV can be found in its 2015 annual report (it is the sum of aircraft purchase commitments). So as to determine the current market value of the Boeing 737 MAX 8, I will use the estimation published by Avitas, an aircraft valuation and consulting firm. Avitas states that the Boeing 737 MAX 8 sells for $51 million per one aircraft, which implies 53% discount to the official list price at $110 million. I will assume that the Boeing 737 MAX 7 is currently offered on the market with a 53% discount as well. For the remaining 89 Boeing 737-800s, I will presume a standard 50% market discount. Source: Author, using LUV's annual report (2015) These assumptions imply total savings of $3.8 billion compared to the other competitors. However, if LUV exercises all of its delivery options (to buy additional 18 Boeing 737-800s and 191 Boeing 737 MAX 8s), LUV could save up to $6.4 billion. These savings will appear in the income statement when LUV's depreciation expense is lower than one of its peers (especially DAL, AAL and UAL). I will assume that LUV will use straight-line depreciation for a period of 25 years and with residual value worth 20%, which is usual for this industry. Under these propositions, LUV's depreciation expense will be relatively lower by $125-$205 million when compared to airlines buying the aircraft for the market price, depending on the extent of utilized options. Assuming a 35% corporate tax rate, this will translate into additional net income of $80-$135 million per year. Investors will be able to see the full effects of the discounts after the delivery of the whole current order book. All of the firmly ordered aircraft should be delivered by 2025 and the last options expire in 2027. When the new aircraft are delivered, other factors should improve the company's financials as well. According to experts, the new Boeing 737 MAX will be 14% more fuel efficient than its predecessor. In 2015, LUV incurred fuel expenses worth $3.4 billion. 14% fuel savings derived from the delivery of the all-new Boeing MAX should therefore save an additional $130-$260 million per year assuming the oil prices from 2015, depending on the number of used options. This number might obviously rise in case of increasing oil price. However, it must be understood that the other US airlines will also have delivered a large number of fuel-efficient aircraft by the end of 2025. Although Boeing states that the Boeing 737 MAX delivers 8% lower operating costs than their main competitor (which is the Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSY ) 320 neo family), this claim is dubious considering the historical experience with the validity of such claims made by aircraft manufacturers. If all carriers achieve comparable operating savings, customers will be the main winners in the longer term as airlines are notoriously known for their insufficient pricing power. If each airline manages to decrease its operating expenses, all carriers will lower fare prices sooner or later, thus decreasing their revenue and net income. However, LUV's savings from cheap aircraft purchases should be permanent as they actually represent a competitive advantage over its US competitors. LUV has recently announced postponing deliveries of 67 Boeings 737 MAXs. The disclosure concerns some of the aircraft, which should have been delivered between 2019 and 2022. The deliveries have been postponed by 3 to 4 years. The last firm order is now scheduled for 2025. Because the price and structure of these orders should remain unchanged, the total final savings should remain as previously estimated (between $3.8 and $6.4 billion). However, these savings will be observable later than previously expected. Although some major US airlines (most prominently AAL and UAL) are currently trading at very low multiples, their stocks are far from no-brainers. Major legacy carriers have a long-standing history of high cyclicality, minimal pricing power, non-existent long-term profits, inclination to suffer from terrorist attacks and solvency problems. Although the reduction of the number of major US airlines to four might increase their pricing power and increase the long-term margins, we have no proof that this effect will be significant. The current investment rationale behind adding AAL or UAL to the portfolio is basically buying a lousy business very cheaply when measured by the P/E ratio based on last year's net income. I do not fancy this approach. Moreover, I am afraid that we are now already at the peak of the industry cycle, or even behind the peak (but still far from the bottom). The industry has reached the peak because of the current record load factors and low oil prices. However, the low oil price environment might eventually turn out to be a curse for the industry as it encourages undisciplined capacity growth. Since the decline in oil price in 2014, the most essential airline fundamentals have been continuously deteriorating. The recent data suggest that fare prices are still decreasing , and therefore PRASM and margins of the major US airlines are eroding. Similar trends have eventually led to tremendous trouble for this industry in the not very distant past. Source: LUV's Investor Day presentation Despite this, I believe that LUV is best positioned for long-term performance among the top four US carriers. LUV's current competitive advantage lies in its low debt, superior management, further potential for growth and reasonable fleet composition (including cheap acquisitions of new aircraft). LUV is therefore the major US carrier, which is best positioned to endure the difficulties of this industry. However, due to the mentioned industry-wide situation, I do not believe the right time to buy LUV is right now. Furthermore, I do not think that LUV's current price is attractive enough considering the industry risks (as it trades at a P/E of 11.7). Because of the same reason, I do not believe that pairing a long position in LUV with a short position in an airline ETF such as the US Global Jets ETF (NYSEARCA: JETS ) is currently interesting either. This pair trade would mitigate the industry risk, but at the same time, it would be a bet on the worsening of airline fundamentals because LUV has the lowest leverage and highest margins among the major US airlines. If an investor expects continuing negative development in the airline industry, he will be better off simply shorting the JETS ETF. I think that now is simply not the right time to have any long position in the major US airlines. Source: LUV's Investor Day presentation However, I must emphasize that the right time will come sooner or later. My strategy is to buy LUV when either of two situations eventually occurs. The first possibility is that the worsening of airline fundamentals will continue because of adding capacity and declining margins until the low-margin carriers find themselves breaking even or even in loss. A significant rise in oil price, slowdown of the general economy or even security threats might also greatly contribute to this result. Given that LUV is the financially strongest major US airline, it will be able to handle almost any industry downturn. At the same time, adverse industry conditions should lead to a reasonable stock price and little likelihood of further capacity increases or fare price declines. The alternative entry point would arise if the US airlines stopped adding capacity and increased pricing before their profits significantly erode. Many investors argue that this will happen because the US airlines have learnt a lesson from the past and the industry is now more consolidated. Still, I am afraid that this will not be the case and the fundamentals will start improving only after significant erosion of the currently record margins. In the next several months, investors should closely monitor the releases of the new data, which are fundamental for the industry (especially capacity growth, PRASM, passenger yields and load factors). Until they start improving, it is not the right time to buy LUV yet. Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.
