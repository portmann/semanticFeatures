It appears that demand, supply, and capitalism briefly won - while 'fairness', 'patriotism', and all the other non-free-market interventionism lost - in the UAW-Ford negotiations... Ford Motor Co. said its new four-year contract with the UAW will increase its U.S. labor costs by less than 1.5 percent annually by letting the company hire more low-cost workers and move production to factories in other countries. The agreement - ratified by 51.3% of Ford production workers allows.. The contract allows Ford to hire an unlimited number of entry-level workers, who start at a lower wage than veterans, after a previous limit of 20 percent of its workforce as new hires. The agreement gives the automaker â€œthe flexibility to leverage Fordâ€™s global manufacturing footprint to improve cost competitiveness,â€? according to the statement. The Ford deal, the richest of the contracts the UAW negotiated with the Detroit 3 this fall, promises $9 billion in factory upgrades and expansions that create or keep 8,500 jobs in the U.S. The pact provides across-the-board raises and $10,000 in bonuses upon ratification. So to translate - union workers just agreed a contract which "creates or keeps" some jobs - sounds familiar; provides some short-term bonuses... but enables Ford to offshore American production and rotate from high-paid to low-paid jobs. Still a job is a job is a job right? Even if it pays drastically less? Mon, 11/30/2015 - 10:30 | 6856324 insanelysane No surprise from Ford.  Ford has colluded with Toyota in trucks.  Ford dropped their line of small trucks such as the Ranger and Explorer Sport Trac and Toyota no longer competes in the larger truck category.  Completely dropped the lines even though they sell a line of small work vans.  Makes absolutely no sense if their was true competition going on. Mon, 11/30/2015 - 10:36 | 6856336 J S Bach What would old man Ford think of what his progeny have done to his company?  He instituted the $5 a day wage back in 1915 thinking about how it would benefit his fellow countrymen-workers.  Today, they piss on them as they slowly erode any loyalty to the U.S.  And what would the author of "The International Jew - The World's Foremost Problem" have thought about the man steering his company's ship, Mark Fields (Finkelman)?  Hmmmmm.

Mon, 11/30/2015 - 10:41 | 6856380 adr Henry Ford's company died in 1956 when his sons and other family members decided to fuck the old man and take his company public to sell it off to the Jews his father so hated. The man died knowing the lofty goals he had for the nation he lived in were crushed by the International Jew. A stern warning for anyone who dares to rise against the empire. Post 1956 the real world economy stagnated and died. The only path to wealth was through Wall Street and only if "they" allow it. Mon, 11/30/2015 - 11:04 | 6856459 Herodotus Your point could be better made if you got the history a little more accurate.  Henry Ford had only 1 child, Edsel.  Edsel died (1943) before the old man did (1947).   I think that you are referring to Edsel's sons.....Henry Ford II, William Clay Ford, Benson Ford.  So it was the old man's grandson, Henry Ford II, who was in charge when the company went public in 1956.  Also, the family members controlled a special class of the stock that always gave them 40% of the voting power, a permanent controlling interest in the company.   This feature helped to keep the ravenous Jews at bay as intended.  To the best of my knowledge, the family still decides who is going to run the company, although, as you infer, as long as the company remains in debt, they are somewhat at the mercy of moneylenders.  Mon, 11/30/2015 - 11:12 | 6856597 _ConanTheLibert...

Mon, 11/30/2015 - 11:31 | 6856724 KnuckleDragger-X Henry Ford was practicing enlightened self-interest, which, as anybody with an MBA or economics degree will tell you is evil. What is truly amazing is that none of these people can figure out why unemployed people, who are barely afloat, isn't buying more useless shit that is being imported from the third world by rent seeking cronies..... Mon, 11/30/2015 - 12:34 | 6857105 Reichstag Fire Dept. The US$5.oo/day wage was to make workers able to afford Ford automobiles as a means to popularize the Ford automobile. Imagine...workers able to afford the products they make?! Old man Ford knew he would be getting a lot of that money back though, didn't he?! ...in the form of sold automobiles to his workers. Also, old man Ford knew that the more cars he sold, the more he could lower his production costs. The more he could lower his production costs the more he could lower prices, the more he could lower his prices the more cars he could sell. The more cars he could sell the more he could lower his production costs, et cetera. He knew he corner the automobile market by being more productive and more competitive...selling more for less...what a novel concept!! Back then, wages were paid out of the "wage fund", this was the amount of money paid to the worker based on the value of their work budgeted into the cost of production...figured on the "credit" side of the ledger. (Remember, the dollar was backed by gold.) Now, wages are paid out of the payroll line of "credit" which is a debt of the company to be repayed. This debt has to compete with all of the other forms of debt incurred by a company including Interest, Taxes, Depriciation, Ammortization or "EBITDA". The companies earning are veiwed on the credit side of the ledger while wages are now a debt, disconnected for old man Ford's 19th century wage model. Herein lays your wage compression. Wages go down in relation to corporate earnings because wages have to compete with the other forms of debt a corporation incurrs. Anybody that cannot attach their wage directly to corporate earnings (like a bonus paid ahead of EBITDA) does not make a "first world" wage. I know my explaination is simplistic and somewhat innacurate but you need to understand this: I'm a dumb fucking heavy equipment operator working at a gold mine in Arctic Canada. So, this is hope? I'm not and economist nor accountant nor Wall Street financier however I DID take a run a federal office in a forgotten part of this country...to no avail, I was ignored. BUT!!! If a dumb cunt like me can figure this much of the economic problem out for himself...just maybe there is a chance in this world?

Mon, 11/30/2015 - 10:51 | 6856437 Apolitical Blues Not at all. The need to trim costs never ceases, FORD is actually to be commended for keeping the jobs in the country. Entry level (apprenticeship) wages are, as a labor guy myself, realistic. Senior, experienced employees carry the corporate intelligence that is always being tapped for feedback, you won't do that with someone you hired last month. I certainly do not see this as some sort of unpatriotic act. Mon, 11/30/2015 - 11:15 | 6856615 BullyBearish Mon, 11/30/2015 - 10:24 | 6856286 Normalcy Bias Don't fret 'Murica! In 10 years when the U.S. has been "fundamentally transformed" into a third world hellhole and most of the population is desperate to work (for food), these manufacturing jobs will return! Young American workers are screwed.  The senior workers (Ford, et al)  greed bandwagon will sell out the future for pleasure today, as in, â€˜my world ends when I end so Iâ€™m taking all I can get, fuck offâ€™. Mon, 11/30/2015 - 12:03 | 6856898 Kickaha Your post highlights a structural problem with labor laws in the USA.  Unions are run by high-seniority members.  Union contracts, first and foremost, take care of the high-seniority workers.  If a contract contains large wage increases that cause the company to turn increasingly to automation, it is the low-seniority workers who suffer the layoffs.  The Union need not concern itself with those short-timers, who lack much in the way of internal union political clout. Nowadays, all unions give lip service, and nothing more, to the concept of "solidarity".  If it takes new and much lower wage levels for new hires to fund wage increases for the high-seniority members, then piss on the new workers.  While a lot of the high-seniority guys have been promoted into positions requiring a lot of skill and experience, many of them are still laborers, and they will be working side-by-side with new hires or temps making a third of what the old guys are making. Union politics dictate that wages must go up, up, up for the high seniority members.  This only works intermediate-term if the company can replace workers with machines and increase productivity enough to fund the higher wages.  Note that the amount of capital investment to which the company commits itself in the labor contract has become a major issue to be addressed in the collective bargaining agreement. Long-term I don't know where this ends.  Maybe ten guys making $250,000/yr. with full fringes running a fully automated plant.  I just can't figure out who is going to be buying the robot-assembled cars, absent a complete re-engineering of how our society handles redistribution of income.  Just as a system designed to manage an agrarian economy needed to be overhauled to manage a manufacturing econony, we need another overhaul to manage an economy where robots are doing more and more of the the "good jobs" that previously existed in manufacturing.   Even professional segments of the economy, like doctors, lawyers, engineers, and accountants, are already suffering losses of revenue due to the ready availability of previously guild-private information on the internet, and there already is much talk about utilizing A.I. programs for routine matters in those professions in the near future. The animosity directed to outsourcing of jobs is rational only in the context of seeking to sway public opinion in favor of protectionist legislation to preserve high wages at home on a purely temporary basis.  Meanwhile, overseas, even the low cost workers are being replaced by machines.  Wake up.  You are living in the Age of Robots.  The only issue of import is how society will divvy up their production.  The enrichment of the .01%  has happened not only due to the financialization of things and asset bubbles, but also because the .01% own most of the capital in an era where the importance of labor diminishes day-by-day.

Mon, 11/30/2015 - 11:03 | 6856512 TradingTroll NO. Welcome to the world of crony capitalism  where the workers, the people who actually  built  these damn  businesses,  don't get a cut of the deal when automation  or off shoring is brought in.I remember  high school  in the 80's. We were supposed to have  shorter  work  weeks due to computers. Instead the politicians  sold out the people who elected them. This is not capitalism. Mon, 11/30/2015 - 11:27 | 6856696 Vlad the Inhaler This is capitalism at its finest!  Automation, outsourcing, hiring illegals, that's what the companies want!  Why don't people understand that companies exist to make profit, not to provide jobs or build a strong economy.  Everyone wants to blame the government, but as far as the corportions go, everything is going according to plan.  Record profits and executive compensation, what more could a company want?  Unfettered capitalism gives us monopolies and workers who get paid just enough to spend their salary on essentials at the company store.  The US standard of living will have to drop to adjust to the global standard sorry. Auto workers need to feel the pain of a contracting economy just like everyone else does. LESS PAY and BENEFITS MUST happen before the idiots wake up and vote for liberty and freedom instead of all this UAW-sponsored soft socialism.

Rather than indignantly demand others share the pain of your choice to remain in a job declining in value, maybe you should choose to change jobs. You may not like it, but robots can increasingly produce what you produce more efficiently.  Just as cars produced transportation more efficiently than horses, and stablekeepers seeing their wages stagnate for 8 years should have understood why and begun looking for new lines of work rather than demanding others share their pain. You've already enjoyed the benefits of one taxpayer bailout that artificially subsidized your job, keeping it from disappearing entirely.  And you continue to enjoy having a job only because auto loans are being artificially subsidized via money supply inflation paid for by all of us.  How many more signals do you need that what you do is no longer sufficiently productive in its own right to fund the salary and benefits you want? Mon, 11/30/2015 - 12:13 | 6856961 Kickaha Outside of the government sector, outside of the financial sector, millions of people have suffered maybe a 67% pay cut, on average, and maybe more if you factor in all those people who can't find jobs. Thank your Union for the degree that collective bargaining laws have insulated you from the general overall economic carnage.  50% out of work.  40% on food stamps.  Foreclosures and bankruptcies running at historical highs. Lots of people used to have good jobs like yours.  Lots of them got laid off and, if there are part of the lucky few, they replaced their $75,000 & full fringes job with a $25,000 no fringes one. Your pain so far has been insignificant when measured against the pain suffered by tens of millions of people in the USA.
