Disney is set to re-name its ABC Family network â€œFreeformâ€? this week. Freeformâ€™s programming itself wonâ€™t really change, but the hope is its audience will expand out beyond the tween demographic. Freeform targets a new group of viewers called â€œBecomersâ€? which is an off-shoot of millennials, an age range that may be less valuable in the coming years. Even if you don't watch any Disney (NYSE: DIS ) programming (across all of its divisions), you've likely heard something about ABC Family becoming "Freeform" in 2016. And even if you haven't, you will soon. Simply put, Disney is re-branding its ABC Family Channel to be called Freeform, but beyond the name not much is going to changeâ€¦ for now. So first off, why the switch and why that name? The network believes its current tween/millennials demo will eventually dissipate. As a result, the channel wants to be ready and expand its horizon which has prompted the creation of the term "Becomers," which will expand its target range to include 14 to 34 year olds. Remember the word "family" has been in the title of this network for decades , so taking it out is a big deal and a big step in changing perceptions. First launched as the "CBN Satellite Service" and more commonly known as the "Christian Broadcasting Network," the channel was founded by Pat Robertson. The idea was a network that only aired religious programming, which eventually was almost entirely phased out. In 1988, the network re-branded as "The CBN Family Channel" and then 2 years later "The Family Channel." In 1997, Fox acquired the channel and named it "Fox Family" and then Disney took control in 2001 naming it "ABC Family." Honestly, the history of the channel is really fascinating as it went through so many brands, re-brands and programming slates that it actually, at different points, was ahead of its time. That brings us back to now and "Freeform," so again, why the name "Freeform?" According to the network "Freeform personifies this fluidity and will deliver ideas, forms of content and ways of interacting with the brand." Network head Tom Ascheim further elaborated on the name and tied it back to that "Becomers" tag and generation by saying "we think that they are indeed in formation on some level, so it really feels like it invokes the quality of being a Becomer." Now all of this is just a fancy way of saying the network is trying to solidify its status with the younger demo while recognizing that demo will, by design, eventually grow out of its programming. So that begs the question: what will this move mean for Disney and its investors? And will it harm the channel to lose the ABC moniker? Truthfully, it's a two-headed beast as keeping the ABC name gets you the "prestige" factor, but it also pigeon-holds you in terms of crafting your own separate identity. This is a lot different than simply adding the word "sports" after your title (i.e. Fox Sports Network). Now keep in mind, the other big question is how this will impact its programming which boasts darker dramas like Pretty Little Liars and the upcoming Shadowhunters? The answer is it won't. Nothing about Freeform's programming is really going to change at the moment. Its annual "25 Days of Christmas" block will remain, classic Disney movies will remain a staple on the lineup, and all of its usual shows will continue to air. Disney has been promoting the change everywhere in December when its audience was the highest, courtesy of its annual Christmas celebration. The winter programming usually draws big numbers and it was the perfect time to sell the change to everyone. ABC and Disney have been going all out to make sure its core base understands this switch, but they really need investors to see the logic above all else. Executives will have to make the case this shift is both important to the channel's long-term success and also won't negatively impact ratings. For now that shouldn't be as much of a problemâ€¦ that is, if shareholders can get their heads around the new name itself.
