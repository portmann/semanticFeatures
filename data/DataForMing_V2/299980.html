Twitter Executive Firings: Wherever You Go, There You Are - Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I am/we are long GOOGL. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey is changing executive teams and strategy. Twitter's (NYSE: TWTR ) latest raft of exits reminds me of what the Atlanta Falcons football team is doing this off-season. Get rid of the assistants and buy time for the coach's plan to succeed. But this assumes there is a plan that could succeed, that CEO Jack Dorsey can get his team into the business play-offs and "make a run." Take Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ), for example. (Please.) The company's problems predate the 2012 arrival of CEO Marissa Mayer. They predate her by many years. Yahoo made the decision (at Wall Street's insistence) to become a "portal," a media company, in the 1990s. It just hasn't worked out. Since making that fateful decision - and leaving search to an upstart Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) - Yahoo has been through 7 CEOs, none of whom could satisfy. Tim Koogle, Terry Semel, Jerry Yang, Carol Bartz, Scott Thompson, Ross Levinsohn. The problem wasn't the management, it wasn't even the strategy, it was the business model, the assumption that an "Internet media" company could grow quickly and scale. Mayer tried some technology fixes, but at heart Yahoo remains what it was when she joined, a media company. Media doesn't scale. Audiences have natural limits. Twitter is going to learn what Yahoo learned. Media requires people, lots of people, creating content on the one side and choosing to view it on the other side. This does not scale the way computers scale. What Internet companies want, more than anything, is self-service and self-creation. They want pages to be created on-the-fly, or they want choices to be limited. And they want a clear business model at the heart of it. I have a friend who has launched many Internet companies, but his most successful was one that sold fishing licenses. It was entirely self-service. The data being used was static, the number of licenses easy to increment and sell. It wasn't a huge business, but it was profitable. When he recognized it had reached its natural limit, he sold it. Twitter isn't like that. Twitter thought it was like that, since users are tweeting to users, but as a business Twitter isn't like that. It needs curation, to keep out scam artists and other bad guys. It needs salesmen, in order to create campaigns and bring in revenue. These costs rise in direct proportion to the size of the tweet-pile and revenue, once certain thresholds are reached. Twitter reached those thresholds a year ago. This is a general problem facing media companies. They can't grow like Internet companies because, while they use the Internet, they're still media. Media is about people communicating with people, and it takes people to do that. You can tweak that with clickbait headlines, with photo "features" that take up multiple pages, or by curating the rest of the Web rather than doing any actual work, but there is a limit to all of that. Media doesn't scale the way Internet investors want their investments to scale. The problem at Twitter isn't the players, and it's not the coaches, either. It's the game.
