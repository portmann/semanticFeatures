Disney's Naysayers Are Wrong Again - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Many investors think Disney is overvalued at $110. But there is much evidence to the contrary as the company's content pipeline is stronger than ever. Entertainment giant Disney (NYSE: DIS ) has certainly been on a roll of late. The company continues to post terrific quarter after terrific quarter and the stock has moved up in sympathy. I've lately heard plenty of rumblings about Disney reaching its overvaluation point and how the stock has gotten ahead of its fundamentals, something I've not seen much of in the past. I've been very bullish on Disney for a while now so in light of the disappointing action from the stock after last week's earnings report, I'll take a fresh look at Disney to see if the naysayers are right this time. To do this, I'll use a DCF-type model you can read more about here . The model uses several inputs, including earnings estimates, which I've borrowed from Yahoo! ; dividends, which I've estimated to grow at 20% annually; and a discount rate, which I've set at the 10-year Treasury rate plus a risk premium of 6%. The estimated fair value is a disappointing $107, lower than the current share price of $110. That would imply that Disney is fully valued at present and then some, indicating perhaps it is not the best long position right now. But let's take a look at the fundamentals to see if that's the case. My bullishness on Disney stems from the company's total domination of the content business. By that I mean that Disney is the master of taking something it creates - a character, a movie, a TV show, etc. - and multiplying its uses across multiple channels. It can create something like Frozen and not only make more than a billion dollars in box office sales, but incorporate it into the parks business, video games, merchandise and many other venues. This is the power of Disney's brand and distribution channels; it isn't just an entertainment company, it is a branding and merchandising machine that can take full advantage of anything it creates. This not only multiplies the revenue stream from a particular piece of content, but also provides lots of diversification in its revenue stream. Disney doesn't just rely on box office receipts or licensing or park revenue; it is an ecosystem of world class content that produces revenue in many ways and that is something that deserves a premium for the stock in my view. There are no other companies like Disney in the world that dominate content the way it does so I'm not surprised the stock looks a little expensive; Disney has earned that right. Disney's Q2 beat was really terrific. The company crushed top and bottom line estimates as broad-based strength in its business powered results higher. Media, Parks and Consumer Products all showed large YoY increases in revenue, while the other two segments - Studio and Interactive - posted decreases. The decrease in the Studio business was before the release of the blockbuster Avengers which should provide a nice boost to Q3 and Q4 results. The Studio business is not only a driver of ticket sales but a huge source of content for all the other lines of businesses so it is critically important to Disney's overall results. While decreases in revenue are never desirable, I'm not concerned about the Studio business, and in fact, that business is the source of my bullishness on the stock. Disney sources much of its content for just about anything else from its parks to video games from the Studio business, not to mention it is a huge source of revenue in its own right. Disney has not only the Avengers series, which still has many iterations that are in the pipeline, but also the new installments of Star Wars in addition to Frozen and other princess franchises that are timeless. In other words, this non-exhaustive list in its own right is likely worth billions of dollars in revenue over the next few years irrespective of cross-selling via other channels. This is why I like Disney so much. It is also working on expanding the Parks business, the second largest business Disney has behind its Media networks. This should expand not only ticket sales for the parks but also merchandising; Disney takes full advantage of its park patrons to sell them Disney branded merchandise, and given the unbelievable pipeline of content, I suspect merchandise and park sales will continue to be strong. From a capital standpoint, Disney is in great shape. The company produced more than $2 billion in free cash flow in the second quarter alone, which allows it to pay its dividend and buy back lots of stock. I expect we'll continue to see 20%+ increases in the dividend each year for the foreseeable future and that buybacks will continue to be a large part of the capital return equation. The reduced share count should boost EPS and provide some fuel for the stock to move higher. Disney may look fully valued at this point but this is always true of stocks that have earned a premium. Given the pipeline of content - the source of virtually all of Disney's revenue - I can't help but think the stock is cheap. If Disney simply meets EPS expectations for the next two years and maintains its current forward multiple of 19.5 - something I think it will have no problem doing - the stock would be worth about $145 in two years' time. While certainly not blockbuster gains, that assumes no forward PE expansion despite huge earnings growth. I think we'll see Disney higher than that but to be conservative, that's a pretty good start. Disney is my favorite stock idea right now and I'm very long; should be a fun ride. Source: Disney's Naysayers Are Wrong Again Disclosure: The author is long DIS.
