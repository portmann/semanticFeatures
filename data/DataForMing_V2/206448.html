Intel: Examining Some Cautionary Points - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Management's commentary provides key answers to questions. Earlier this week, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) announced third quarter results . While there wasn't any groundbreaking news that I felt needed to be discussed, I still wanted to provide an update. Fellow SA contributor Anchorite recently provided a rather cautionary article on the name, and I believe some of the points mentioned require further examination. For those who don't have time to read the entire article, here are the main points I want to address: Even a $1 billion sale of modems to Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) would be insignificant. The stock buyback has slowed to a trickle. In terms of Intel's IoT business, it's still relatively small. Through the first nine months of 2015, the segment contributed just 4.14% to Intel's overall revenues. However, at nearly 8% year-over-year growth, the segment is growing faster than Intel as a whole. As far as Anchorite's point about IoT being low margin, the segment had an operating margin of 22.9% through Q3 2015. That's just 100 basis points lower than Intel's overall operating margin. While it's not as profitable as the Data Center Group, IoT is average and better than some of Intel's other segments. If the IoT segment can grow in the double digits going forward, it should definitely represent a high single-digit percentage of the business by the end of the decade. When looking at point two, there are two things to think about: business impact and market impact. While a $1 billion win for Intel wouldn't be tremendous in terms of revenues, I think it would have a somewhat significant impact in terms of Intel's perception. Over the past few years, investors have been downtrodden regarding the chip giant's failures in mobile. Even if the business isn't that profitable, just the announcement of Intel gaining a big Apple win should be significant to investors. Just look at what happened back in March when we heard this initial rumor. Some revenues are better than no revenues, and this could lead to more partnerships down the road. When it comes to contra-revenues, management gave a bit of color on this situation on the conference call . CEO Brian Krzanich stated that Intel is on track to improve mobile profitability by $800 million this year. CFO Stacy Smith stated that contra-revenues have mostly abated this year. In the past, Intel was criticized for losing so much in mobile, even as it began to rapidly increase CPU shipments. Now, volumes may be down but that leads to fewer losses. Krzanich followed this up later in the call: That said, what we said around mobility is that, on tablets, we pretty much keep our share and our position in the market relatively equal to where it was, and everybody sees tablets have shrunk this year as a category. And so we have been careful about not chasing the bottom as prices drop, figuring out where the value is, where we can go in and make a little bit of money, and actually add some innovation. So you're going to see some tablets as we go towards the holidays, with things like RealSense and that allow people new usages and new applications. And as we go into 2016, you will see more of that. With regard to the buyback, the slowdown should not have been an earth-shattering event. Yes, the Altera (NASDAQ: ALTR ) deal is a major part of this, as Intel has borrowed billions to fund the deal. When you are spending $13 billion or so on a purchase for future growth, that money has to come from somewhere. I covered the financial aspect of this earlier this year where CFO Stacy Smith reiterated how Intel uses its cash: And just coming on the last part of your question, John, we - as Brian said, our priority is to invest in the business first, dividend second, and then we use the buyback to modulate cash balances. In 2014, management saw extra cash on the balance sheet and put it to use through the buyback. The dividend also was raised for 2015. As Anchorite pointed out in the article, Intel did step up its buyback in Q3 2015, buying $1 billion worth of shares at prices quite a bit lower than the first half of this year. The buyback is used to manage cash balances, and so it shouldn't be looked at a primary item with regard to cash. I'd be much more worried if Intel doesn't boost its dividend in 2016 than I would be if the buyback slows down. This is especially true given the Altera purchase and management's statement that capex will likely be higher next year. In fact, investors might see a few positives in Intel's report, especially given the nice Q3 beat on the top and bottom lines. One of the key items I discussed in my earnings preview was with regard to the stock's technicals. As you can see in the chart below, Intel's earnings report was enough for the stock to stay above its 200-day moving average. That should likely provide support to shares until we get more clarity on 2016 in November. While Intel isn't firing on all cylinders currently, I don't think investors should be overly cautious. For those looking for answers, management has provided a lot of commentary regarding contra-revenues and cash uses. The IoT segment has potential for Intel, even if it's not the company's largest business. Also, an Apple win would be great for mobile perception, something Intel has struggled with in recent years. Since Anchorite's original article regarding caution with Intel, shares have lost about 4%, but that's a lot better than the roughly 8% decline in the iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX ).
