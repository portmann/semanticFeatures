Like Gap, whose CEO said the company would consider working with Amazon if it means reaching shoppers. While speaking at the companyâ€™s annual investorâ€™s meeting, CEO Art Peck said Gap would think about relying on third-party sellers like Amazon, the Chicago Tribune reports. “To not be considering Amazon and others would be — in my view — delusional,” Peck said. “We are always considering all of the opportunities beyond our traditional mix of channels and stores. Amazon is certainly one, and there are others as well.” Gap has been struggling with sluggish same-store sales lately, as customers spurn malls and turn toward online shopping. Amazon is pulling in clothing shoppers, on the other hand, and could become the No. 1 U.S. apparel retailer by next year, according to Cowen & Co. In the meantime, Amazon has taken steps to sell its own clothing lines with new private-label collections.
