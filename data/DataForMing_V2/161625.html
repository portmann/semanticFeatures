ETF Hub Sep  2 2015, 19:56 ET | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor The buildup to Star Wars' "Force Friday" is under way, with Walt Disney's (NYSE: DIS ) 18-hour toy rollout having kicked off a short time ago via its live YouTube channel . It began in the morning local time in Sydney, with a custom lightsaber-building toy kit from Hasbro. Eighteen hours is a long time for opening 15 toys, though, so there's a bit of a lull until the Tokyo unboxing at 10 p.m. ET ( schedule ). "Force Friday" is an all-out promotional effort, coming more than three months before Star Wars: The Force Awakens (the film) bows. The merch will likely add hundreds of millions of dollars to Disney's 2016 revenues, leading up to another film in December 2016. The lead manufacturer of the toys is Hasbro (NASDAQ: HAS ), and other producers include Electronic Arts (NASDAQ: EA ), collectible-card company Topps, Lego, Rubie's Costumes and Tobar novelties.
