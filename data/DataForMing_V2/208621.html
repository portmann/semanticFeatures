How AMD Inside Apple Can Beat Intel Inside - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) | Seeking Alpha AMD has been shunned by Apple for years due to its inferior performance. Maintaining high margins while lowering Mac prices requires cost cutting, and when it comes to processors, Intel and Nvidia aren?t very cooperative. AMD, given its situation, has been very cooperative, and has allowed itself to replace Nvidia in many Mac products; AMD's semi-custom business will make it even more cooperative. AMD's technology has improved dramatically, and with a compelling new architecture arriving late next year, it could be a win-win for both Apple and AMD. When Steve Jobs was around, Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) vision was very clearly to make the greatest products in the world, almost regardless of price. This was also when the Mac was out of the reach of the average consumer, but after several price reductions over the years, the Mac has now become much more affordable for the average consumer. Apple's continued price drops will undoubtedly entice more Mac users, but it could be at the cost of its attractive margins if it continues to use Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) processors. One plausible solution is to replace Intel's x86 chips with Apple's own ARM (NASDAQ: ARMH ) processors, but through a complex transition. Another solution is to replace Intel's costly x86 processors with AMD's (NASDAQ: AMD ) much more affordable x86 processors; of course, this would be with AMD's late 2016 Zen product, which is a ground-up architecture that many people believe will be AMD's saving grace and a great competitor to Intel's chips. Apple has already begun to grasp the cost-benefits that AMD has provided by replacing much of its expensive Nvidia graphics chips with AMD's just-as-effective, much more affordable graphics solutions. Such solutions include the Mac Pro, 5K iMac, and 15" MacBook Pro with Retina Display. Additionally, AMD has a very good graphics API, and the best way to utilize this API with the greatest cost savings is to copy what Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Sony (NYSE: SNE ) did with the Xbox One and PS4 gaming consoles. These companies asked AMD to create a very customized CPU+GPU processing solution that would be both powerful, cost-effective, and efficient since all of the processing is on a single die. Thanks to this, Sony debuted a gaming console far cheaper than the previous generation, while actually generating a profit instead of an enormous loss. Intel's graphics are far inferior to AMD's, and separately using Intel's CPU technology and Nvidia's GPU technology was just far too costly for Sony and Microsoft, and so AMD was the perfect choice. If AMD were to utilize a successful Zen chip, tied with technologies like High-Bandwidth Memory and Heterogenous System Architecture in a customized chip solution for Apple, it would be a win-win for the two companies. Apple would be able to continue to make top-tier products, but at much more affordable pricing, and AMD would restore its reputation and generate meaningful income for investors, who suffer with a stock near an all-time low. Two years ago, Apple finally accepted AMD's products, mostly thanks to affordability, and decided to power its most powerful workstation with two Radeon professional graphics processors. Professional graphics is a high-margin business, and AMD definitely bit the bullet here. However, Apple was able to create a highly-affordable workstation solution that delivered a price-performance ratio that was unmatched by any other workstation on the market. This was an excellent win for AMD, and over the next two years, Apple adopted AMD's GPUs in its prestigious 5K iMac and more recently, the 15" MacBook Pro with Retina Display. As far as I'm concerned, the graphics of Apple's Macs are now only powered by Intel's integrated chips and AMD's discrete chips. This is a cheaper combination, but having the two processors as separate units is a major cost disadvantage. A semi-custom processor is a solution that AMD provides for customers who want an entirely unique, fully-customizable chip for any kind of application, ranging from workstations to gaming consoles. Sony and Microsoft were the first to utilize this feature with the PS4 and Xbox One, and the resulting solution allowed these companies to generate a powerful, efficient, and highly cost-effective solution on a single die. There was no other company in the world who could offer this single-die solution in a cost-effective manner because Intel's graphics were far too inferior for gaming consoles, and Nvidia doesn't offer a compelling CPU solution that could match Intel's or AMD's x86 processors. Surely, Intel and Nvidia could create an amazing solution with two separate processors, but the cost would be through the rooof with the high margins that both companies demand. With a semi-custom solution, Apple could go to AMD, pay an upfront R&D fee, and tell AMD exactly what it needs for whatever kind of Mac it intends on creating. Currently, with AMD's inferior products, such a solution at Apple's high standards would be impossible. However, with AMD's future ground-up architecture, Zen, coupled with technologies such as High-Bandwidth Memory, HSA and its high-performance graphics chips, AMD could provide Apple with a very compelling all-in-one solution. Furthermore, since AMD is struggling to survive and will be in dire need of any design win by the time Zen comes out, I have a feeling that the chipmaker will be very interested in sacrificing its already-low margins to help the world's most valuable company create a powerful, low-cost solution to entice more consumers. After years of shunning AMD, Apple changed its mind and is now using Radeon GPUs as its discrete graphics solution instead of Nvidia's costly chips. This was a vital decision for Apple in order to maintain its impressive margins while creating cost-effective solutions. AMD's graphics solutions are years ahead of Intel's, and as the only other x86 chipmaker in the world, it can theoretically replace some Intel chips with a smooth transition, which would be far more favorable to the complex transition that ARM chips would pose. Furthermore, AMD provides a unique semi-custom business that would allow Apple to obtain completely customized processors, which could lower costs dramatically in the same way that the semi-custom business helped create the powerful, yet highly affordable PS4 and Xbox One.
