Union opening up $400M fund for Verizon workers as strike drags on - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha May  3 2016, 15:26 ET | About: Verizon Communications (VZ) | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Verizon ( VZ -1.4%) wireline workers headed toward the start of week four of a strike will start getting paid from a $400M union fund , as both sides look no closer to agreement. “We think the strike is quite strong and the people are not crossing the lines and we have not seen anything that resembles concerns by members about going back to work,” says the CWA's George Kohl. Meanwhile, ahead of the company's annual meeting this Friday, the CWA is pushing a set of shareholder proposals aimed at improving corporate governance. A proposal to require that the chairman be an independent director has the support of CalPERS and CalSTRS, and one to require shareholder approval of golden parachutes over a certain size has their support and that of Institutional Shareholder Services as well. The IBEW has proposed that executives be required to retain 75% of the shares they get as compensation, a proposal backed by CalPERS, it says. Nearly 40,000 East Coast workers walked off the job three weeks ago. Last week Verizon said it would add "thousands" of temporary workers to help fill the gap, and today it says more than 20,000 employees and contractors have filled thousands of new orders since the strike began. Any FIOS customer hates the service, the intermittent internet connections, the lost or disconnected phone calls, and the 35 minute waits for a live operator.  VZN is the worst corporation in the U.S. bar none.  They deserve everything they get, and then some. Do the union construction guys still leave the garage at 7 am ,then head to a coffee shop and get to their first job at 9.
