ETF Hub Sep 18 2015, 04:25 ET | About: Apple Inc. (AAPL) | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor A federal appeals court has ruled that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has the right to block Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) from using its patented inventions, such as slide-to-unlock, autocorrect and quicklinks, in a verdict that could have major consequences for South Korean electronics maker's future. Since it was a split decision, Samsung said it would ask that the issue be considered by all active judges of the Federal Circuit, but if it does not win the appeal, it may be forced to tweak its software even in recent devices such as the Galaxy S6. Win win for Samsung already as they have sold millions of phones with patent violation. Its not like consumers are going to return the phones and a tweaking wouldn't matter as average Joe and Jill would not even notice. Who writes these articles?  In the first line there is a grammar mistake that is blatant to say the least.  Please try to reread your articles before printing them.  That is the minimal requirement of a professional journalist. It has always been obvious to me, someone who doesn't own a smartphone, that just by watching others use theirs that Samsung has pilfered many Apple tech innovations. Yes, there are ways to circumvent patents with small tweeks and Samsung will find them, but going forward they will be less likely to try to piggy-back on Apple's shoulders. BTW, no monetary award for damages?
