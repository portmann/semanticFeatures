Unless you count group calls. Wait, what was that? Oh, never mind, it can do that now too.Â  Facebook, in a move that puts in one step closer to being Skype, announced it will now allow anyone to make group voice calls through the Messenger app. The new feature, unveiled by head of Messenger David Marcus , is expected to roll out globally to users over the next 24 hours. â€œIf you have the latest version of Messenger, you should see the phone icon appear in group conversations within the next 24 hours,â€? Marcus said in a Facebook post. â€œGive it a try, and as always, let us know how we can make it even better for you!â€? Users can initiate a group call by tapping on the phone icon within Messenger. They can then manage individual participants on the next screen. For now Facebook isnâ€™t allowing group video calls.
