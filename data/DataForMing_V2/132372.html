Learn more about PRO » U.S. Cellular is a wireless telecoms provider in largely rural and suburban areas. The company has been divesting assets in non-core markets to focus on key regions. U.S. Cellular is shrinking in terms of revenues and postpaid subscribers. Performance and growth in core markets are stagnant. U.S. Cellular Corporation (NYSE: USM ) is a medium-sized wireless telecoms operator that provides coverage in mainly suburban and rural areas. In terms of the size of their subscriber base, USM is relatively small compared to the likes of Verizon (NYSE: VZ ), AT&T (NYSE: T ) and T-Mobile (NYSE: TMUS ). Hence, while they still have the scale to remain profitable and retain a stable subscriber base, USM is not performing well in terms of net additions and cash flow growth, leading many to characterize it as a company in secular decline. With rapidly declining free cash flows, weak competitiveness, a lack of positive catalysts and comparative overvaluation, USM's poor fundamentals and expensive price tag supports a bearish thesis for both the short and long term. In the past few years, USM has been divesting wireless assets in non-core markets, selling cell towers, base stations and spectrum. A key part of their programme has been spectrum swaps - exchanging wireless spectrum licenses in non-core markets for spectrum in core markets, plus some cash. This is in line with their strategy of focusing their resources on key markets in which they have competitive advantages, whilst abandoning non-core markets. Through this process, they have been able to raise significant liquidity and increased the amount of spectrum in their key markets. Although their strategy appears sound, there are certain risks to this 'streamlining' approach. By focusing on smaller geographical regions, USM might be compromising on data coverage and performance in other regions, possibly resulting in subscribers leaving due to the limited coverage. According to their coverage map , USM's 4G LTE coverage is severely lacking in most states. My concern is whether subscribers will still feel that the level of coverage is adequate despite the largely 3G speeds. This concern is exacerbated by the fact that USM's plans are not cheap relative to carriers with better speeds and coverage, such as Verizon and AT&T. When we reviewed USM's plans, the price structure is heftier than T-Mobile and Sprint, without offering a similarly wide coverage. Furthermore, with a price on par with Verizon and AT&T, it would be difficult to find reasons to remain with U.S. Cellular, even in states where they claim as their core market. Given that USM's strategy has been to shrink and focus only on key markets, we could see churn continue to rise in the future as customers from non-core areas or near non-core areas switch carriers. For the past three years, churn has already been trending much higher, with subscriber base growth slowing significantly. This reflects the growing concern that customers are no longer satisfied with their service and data coverage. (Note: Given that Postpaid Customers make up approx. 93% of USM's retail customers, we will be focusing our discussion more on Postpaid Figures) By narrowing down their focus to core markets in the Iowa, Nebraska and North Carolina region, USM is also limiting their growth as they have no plans to expand to other areas. Moreover, these states in their core markets are not fast-growing regions compared to other regions such as the coastal areas. The limited upside could weigh on the stock as the growth trajectory diverges from other bigger, faster-growing carriers, thus becoming a comparatively less attractive investment in the same sector. As seen above, the shrinkage in consolidated revenues reflects the effect of the divestitures and slower overall growth for the company. The performance in core markets has not been able to compensate for the growth in divestiture markets. In fact, when we take a closer look at the figures, the core markets are not doing well. Even after adjusting for divestitures, we see that the core markets have been losing postpaid subscribers, and only managed to achieve a net gain in the past year. Essentially, there is almost zero growth in USM's strongest regions, with subscriber numbers currently stagnant and service revenues dropping. There is no growth in both divested and core markets, indicating a general decline. As mentioned earlier, USM's plans are relatively expensive compared to T-Mobile and Sprint (NYSE: S ), and their network quality and area of coverage is inferior compared to AT&T and Verizon, who have similar fees. The result is that USM is not able to stand out in any categories. While they may provide 4G LTE coverage and a wide selection of devices in their core states, their financial, marketing and technical prowess is below that of the Big Two. Hence, there is no real differentiator as to why customers should choose USM over other subscribers. Perhaps their loyalty points system serves as a unique feature, but given that other carriers are engaging in an array of promotions as the industry becomes more competitive, it is not a strong enough incentive for subscribers to stay. Due to their divestitures and spectrum swaps in recent years, USM is fairly well capitalized as the cash gains from these deals were used to reduce liabilities and fund CapEx. Hence, long-term commitments and liabilities seem manageable with debt-to-equity ratio at 0.33. However, investors should realize that USM does not have the financial wherewithal to pay dividends or return value to shareholders. This is due to the fact that free cash flow is overwhelmingly negative and eats into cash balances every quarter. The graph above shows USM's quarterly free cash flow. I've used a moving average of 4 periods to smooth out any volatile one-off spikes or dips to discern a more consistent trend. Evidently, USM's free cash flow has been on a steady decline, and the company is now burning through cash at a rate of roughly $140M/quarter. Given that cash balances are $367M as of the latest quarter, the money will barely last till the end of this year. Therefore, even though USM has sufficient liquidity and low long-term debt for now, they would need to take on debt or issue equity to raise funds if this trend persists. Essentially, unless USM can fix their broken business and become more competitive, their liquidity and finances will consequently follow the downward trajectory of their business prospects. Comparing USM to its peer group, we notice some distinct signs of overvaluation. To put these figures in context, USM and Sprint are the only carriers among the five whose revenues and operating cash flows have shrunk in recent years. Other wireless carriers continue on a growth trajectory whilst these two have languished. Yet when we look at forward P/E, P/FCF and P/OCF, USM is more expensive compared to much larger and faster-growing peers like T-Mobile, Verizon and AT&T. Furthermore, consider the fact that Verizon and AT&T enjoy far wider margins and more economies of scale due to their pricing power and size, and USM would seem even more overpriced. An argument could be made here that the Price/Book provides a floor for USM as it could very well become a takeover target given the low value attached to its assets. However, even if this argument were to hold, it would simply mean that USM has moderate downside and almost no upside potential. There is some merit to this thinking as USM does hold a significant chunk of low bandwidth spectrum in its core states, which would be worth far more than the $1.8B in book value currently assigned to it. Unfortunately, due to a variety of factors, a buyout is unlikely in the near future. When analyzing the probability of a buyout, we need to consider the motivations of potential buyers. For AT&T and Verizon, the only attractive part of USM's assets are the spectrum licenses it holds. However, given that both companies just spent billions on the FCC's recent spectrum auction, they've secured sufficient licenses for their foreseeable needs. Moreover, Verizon in particular is facing a moderate liquidity crunch and is unlikely to make an offer for USM at a premium. For Sprint and T-Mobile, the former has a massive cash crisis while T-Mobile's strategy has been to grow organically instead of through acquisitions. Sprint's cash burn is running at such a high rate that they can barely sustain themselves, whereas T-Mobile has almost no incentive to acquire USM as their strategy has been highly successful in expanding their subscriber base and increasing cash flows. Hence, among the list of potential acquirers, the lack of incentives and finances make it highly unlikely that USM will be acquired at a premium. Perhaps the one bright spot in this entire story is the smartphone penetration and consequently, average revenue per user (ARPU) figures. From 2013 to 2014, ARPU jumped almost 4.5% due to an "increase in smartphone penetration rates." Compared to subscribers operating predominantly in metro and urban areas, USM's postpaid subscriber base has relatively low smartphone penetration although it has been rising at a tremendous pace for the past few years. This creates more potential to grow as USM is not yet fully monetizing its subscriber base until smartphone penetration reaches saturation, resulting in an increase in data fees. As seen above, postpaid ARPU has been increasing at a good pace. From USM's disclosures, the main cause of this has been higher smartphone penetration, resulting in more revenues from data usage. However, the higher ARPU numbers have not been able to boost overall revenues as churn rates have trended higher and postpaid subscriber growth is stagnant. Therefore, despite this bright spot, USM's financial performance has continued to languish due to their flawed strategy and weak value proposition. Moreover, as smartphone numbers approach saturation, we predict ARPU growth will consequently begin to slow down and reach a cliff. At the current rate, smartphone penetration would reach a saturation at ~90% in roughly 3-4 years, at which point, USM would not have any growth catalysts. As I've mentioned here using the example of Verizon, the bigger telcos understand that in a few years, growth from data fees will begin to slow, which is why they are searching for ways to boost data usage, and new streams of revenue. This is done by offering OTT, connected devices and premium video streaming (think of AT&T's DirecTV and Verizon's streaming rights acquisitions), which would incentivize greater data usage on their networks. For USM, however, there is no indication of building an infrastructure to offer these premium services. This would be another disadvantage, and another reason for subscribers to abandon them for other carriers. As the industry moves forward, USM seems to be stuck in second speed in relation to the big boys. USM's strategy of divesting and focusing on core markets seems reasonable initially, but loses credibility due to the fact that performance in core regions is stagnant, with postpaid subscriber losses and churn rates rising significantly over the past few years. Furthermore, there is a distinct lack of competitiveness in the company's offerings, as there is little incentive for the marginal customer to sign for a U.S. Cellular plan rather than plans by the other bigger telecoms. With a lack of growth catalysts and limited potential for growth, USM is likely to shrink slowly over the long term. Source: U.S. Cellular: Shrinking Slowly Disclosure: I am/we are long VZ.
