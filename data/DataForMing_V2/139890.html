How Apple Stock Does Before New iPhones Are Introduced - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha In my previous article I covered how Apple last did when its growth expectations got so low. In this one, I cover how Apple has done in each of the past 5 iPhone launches. I have already written on how Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) stock last did when revenue growth expectations got so low as they are today (going forward, to next fiscal year), and how there possibly being no bump from the iPhone 6s is producing such expectations. This was a matter-of-fact take on past events, but it was seen as negative (though I took pains not to classify the article as such). Today I'm going to do something different. I am going to show how Apple stock did before the introduction of each of the past 5 iPhone models (4, 4s, 5, 5s and 6). I think this particular article might be seen differently. The last 5 iPhones were launched (unveiled) on the following dates: (Source: Yahoo Finance , adjusted closes) Remember, these quotes are adjusted for the effects of dividends and splits. We can already see a pattern here - every single time, the share price was higher on the day before the unveiling, versus 1 month + 1 day from the unveiling. How much higher? Here's a table for that: "Quite a bit" is the answer. Not only did the stock go up every time (100% win rate) but it also went up by an average of 4%, which is quite juicy. Apple stock has been doing badly since apple reported FQ3 earnings. Indeed, its drop is even steeper in the short-term than it was during the last growth slowdown chronicled in my previous article. Adding to that, not even I expect Apple's drop to match the previous "nearly 50% drop". Since Apple is fundamentally so strong and cheap, however, there might be reason to buy the stock around mid-August as it will coincide with about 1 month to the 6s launch date (still unknown right now). Those wanting to hold Apple for the longer term and seeking a good timing to add to it. Those just wanting to put on a short-term trade for the iPhone 6s unveiling. Indeed, for those more aggressive still, that moment might even be now, knowing that Apple will have a tendency to do well in at least 2/3rds of the time from here to the iPhone 6s launch and that the present trajectory downward is likely too steep. Of course, for those using this for just a trade, don't forget to sell on the day before the phone is actually unveiled. As for the others, selling is not a concern. While this article is tagged a "long idea", be aware that this classification pertains only to the 1 month to 1 day time period before the launch event. Outside of that the pattern gives us no more information.
