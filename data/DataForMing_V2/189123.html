This Is Why You're Buying Disney - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Bret Kenwell , Future Blue Chips (25 clicks) Disney shares have cratered 20% from the highs, scaring off some investors. But the company has catalyst after catalyst to continue pushing the business to new highs. Investors beg and beg for a pullback so they can buy stocks, only to wimp out when that opportunity finally arises. That's why in August I wrote, The Correction Everyone Asked For, But Nobody Wants . The principal can be applied to individual stocks too. Take Disney (NYSE: DIS ) for example. The stock had been on a meteoric rise, climbing 30% on the year before it reported earnings on August 4th. Post-earnings, the stock cratered more than 20% over a half-dozen weeks, partly because of the broader market decline, but mostly due to some comments from CEO Bob Iger about a slight subscriber loss for ESPN. Now suddenly, all those investors that were practically begging for a pullback of 5% or 10%, are taking a pass on the stock now that it's down 20%?! With all due respect, let's remember that Disney has more on its books than just ESPN. If you don't want to own Disney, that's fine. But for those of you twiddling your thumbs and swimming in a sea of uncertainty, I would recommend you think long and hard about what kind of investor you are. In it for the next 3-6 months? Sorry, can't help you there. In it for the long haul? Then what are you waiting for? If you've been waiting for a pullback in the name, don't stand by idly, take advantage of the drop. In the company's third quarter conference call , Iger spooked investors when he said ESPN saw subscriber loss. But he also seemed quite upbeat about the overall media business. In fact, focusing just on ESPN, the network's ad dollars for the quarter rose roughly 5% when excluding the "difficult comparison with the Men's World Cup in Q3 last year, which more than offset the benefit of an additional game of the NBA Finals in Q3 this year," Iger explained. That's not bad. In fact, ESPN I would argue is alive and well. In a recent conference , COO Tom Staggs noted how well the network is doing, with viewership for ESPN Watch, its streaming service, up 60%. For sports programming, 96% is watched live, which is a huge benefit when it comes to selling ads. (Disney is one of my Future Blue Chips holdings, and when FBC stocks hold conferences, I listen, take notes and publish those findings, here .) Disney is hell-bent on getting the most out of its $4 billion purchase of Lucasfilm. During that recent conference, Staggs noted Disney is "making sure that Star Wars touches pretty much every aspect of the company." The highly anticipated Episode 7 hits theaters this December, Episode 8 in 2017 and Episode 9 in 2019. As if these blockbusters weren't enough, Disney is pushing one more in there, a standalone film, Rouge One, which will play in December 2016. Captain America: Civil War - May 2016 There's more on slate , but these are some of the big hits. Also, don't forget Frozen 2 will be on there at some point as well. It's incredible how Disney can make a single film, (such as Finding Nemo or Frozen), and have it turn into a potential franchise. Staggs practically said the company has a near unlimited number of Marvel characters it can draw on for future films. The addition of Marvel and Lucasfilm also helps draw in a larger demographic. Disney is making itself a larger and larger part of consumers' lives, from children to teens to adults. Let's not forget about toys. For the first nine months of its fiscal year, the company's consumer products division has grown revenue 13%, while operating income has soared 37%. With the holidays on tap, as well as plenty of momentum in its Marvel and new Star Wars merchandise, look for this category to continue outperforming. While its $1.33 billion in operating income is impressive, it lags that of the Parks and Resorts' $2.29 billion, which is up 16% year-over-year. This area is so exciting. In spring 2016, the company will open the doors to its highly anticipated Shanghai park. Expectations are high, and management has a very, very long-term view for this venue, (which is good us long-term investors). China is so large, that even with locations in Hong Kong and Shanghai, management has not ruled out the possibility of another park. Back in the States, the company is making additional attractions to extend the operating hours of Animal Kingdom (which closes earlier than the other parks and should help boost capacity), building Pandora -- The World of Avatar , adding Frozen attractions, and putting Star Wars parks in both California and Florida locations. It's like all Disney does is continue to impress, business-wise. Movies, sports, theme parks, consumer products, TV shows. If you've been waiting for a pullback to buy, but have been scared due to the latest plunge, I urge you to think long-term. Maybe this will serve as a wake up call, or at the very least, a reminder as to why you're already long. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
