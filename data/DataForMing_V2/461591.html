Earnings Watch: Microsoft's New Total Addressable Market - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Eyes are on Microsoft as it continues its purchase of LinkedIn. With YoY revenue growth of less than 2%, investors are rightly anxious about new potential for growth. As earnings season is underway, the Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) proposal to purchase LinkedIn (NYSE: LNKD ) for $26bn will be at the forefront of the company's earnings report. Several important features of the deal were disclosed at the time, including the $196/share price, the financing of the deal to be covered by new debt, and how each company sees the potential synergies and future together. Importantly, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella remarked that "LinkedIn will retain it's distinct brand, culture and independent (and) Jeff Weiner will remain CEOâ€¦" I believe the $3bn in revenue and the robust Total Addressable Market (TAM) were strong determinants in Microsoft's decision-making for the deal. In the press conference on June 13, 2016, announcing the deal, Microsoft enclosed an interesting slide that has been somewhat overlooked in the hubbub about an old tech giant buying a new social media company: Microsoft explained that "while LinkedIn and Microsoft are highly complementary, they participate in unique total addressable markets. In addition to TAM growth, the likelihood of seizing more of the TAM will increase through differentiated experiences." That is, not only do they see the pie growing bigger, but also that post acquisition, Microsoft will be able to grab a larger slice of that $315bn pie. Essentially, Microsoft gets to use low-cost debt to finance a transaction to add $3bn+/year in revenue. It expects $150mn in cost savings from the deal as well. The newly tooled company then sees great opportunity in growing revenue further by attacking this larger TAM. Microsoft considers LinkedIn's TAM as "unique" considering the slide above counts LinkedIn's $115bn TAM as additive to Microsoft's $200bn TAM. Indeed, it is easy to see the new advertising opportunities go after individuals and organizations. Additionally, the research, data and analytics coming from LinkedIn will give insight into the industries that Microsoft may be licking its chops to squeeze more dollars from. The Backdrop of MSFT's FY16 Q3 Report The first issue investors should be curious about is the status of the capital return program, where MSFT returned $6.4bn to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Now, Microsoft claims the program that has approximately $10bn remaining "will be completed on schedule." Perhaps so, but the implementation of a new or extended capital return program may be at risk. Microsoft should provide significant guidance on how the LinkedIn acquisition will affect Microsoft's dividend and appetite for more share repurchases. To say Microsoft's revenue growth will budge significantly once LinkedIn is brought into the fold seems a bit of a stretch. In Q3, MSFT reported revenue of $22bn, largely in-line with expectations, and $0.62EPS, a short miss. Microsoft should allay investor concerns about the future of the capital return program while offering more color on how LinkedIn will add to revenue growth. Microsoft has enough cash on hand (approximately $100bn) to buy LinkedIn four times over. Again, the drumbeat for cash repatriation and taxes is heard as the likely culprit for the new debt issuance - $26bn of debt on the balance sheet, though, also should give investors pause. Deducting interest on the debt may save the company billions in taxes too. The optics on a new, larger TAM are promising, but we hope to see details on how Microsoft's finances are to be shaped for the better.
