Intel Shouldn't Worry If Apple Excludes It From Future Macs - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Apple upgraded its 27-inch iMacs with Intel's new Skylake processors. Going forward Apple might discard Intel?s processors from some of its Mac models. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) recently upgraded its 27-inch iMacs with Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) new Skylake processors. Although this is good news for Intel's PC business, it's widely expected that Apple will eventually cut its relationship with Intel and migrate to custom ARM (NASDAQ: ARMH )-based chips for its Macs. In Q3 , revenue from Intel's Client Computing Group witnessed a 7% year-over-year decline to $8.5 billion, driven by declining PC and tablet sales. Amid such a scenario, the launch of Skylake could help Intel stabilize its Client Computing Group revenue. However, if in the long run Apple migrates from Intel's x86-based processors to ARM for Macs, Intel might not face any significant problem. I believe a new economics is developing between the two companies. The only reason Apple might consider moving away from Intel's x86-based architecture is cost-effectiveness. Currently Apple's OS X operating system compilation is based on Intel's x86 architecture. Earlier the iMac-maker migrated from PowerPC to Intel not due to cost advantages. Rather, it was forced to do so as PowerPC chipmakers IBM (NYSE: IBM ) and Freescale (formerly Motorola) departed from the PC market. Intel charges Apple a hefty sum of money for allowing the latter use of its advanced processors that are difficult to copy. However, if Apple uses SoCs it designs itself, it would be able to offer customers Macs at a lower price, which would eventually lead to increased market share. KGI Securities' Ming-Chi Kuo believes that within the next 1-2 years Apple's in-house design team would be able to come out with SoCs that are at par with Intel's power-efficient Atom chips. Rumors are also doing the rounds that Apple has already developed an ARM-equivalent version of OS X. However, the fact is Apple can never exclude Intel from its entire Mac lineup. If in the high-end Macs, such as Mac Pro and MacBook Pro that are largely used in the creative market segment, Apple incorporates low power ARM-based chips, it will definitely lose its loyal user-base in that particular segment. So Apple can't afford to do that. However, a partial shift to ARM for the Macs is always possible, and I expect Apple to exactly do that. If for low-end Macs Apple uses ARM-based chips going forward, I don't think Intel should worry. Why? Because at the end of the day both Apple and Intel need sales and profit growth amid a fiercely competitive environment, and the AppTel (I've borrowed the idea from WinTel) combination that's gradually unfolding will be a win-win situation for both the companies. My readers know from my past articles that I am a believer of a marketing strategy known as product differentiation, which in essence means that if more options are offered to customers for a product, market share of a large corporation will remain protected with diverse needs of customers being met. I expect Apple to offer both ARM- and Intel-based Macs, the former at the low-end category and the latter at the high-end category. I also believe Apple will launch an ARM-compatible version of OS X for the Macs running on ARM-based SoCs. Now let's focus on what Intel would get in exchange. I deliberately used the phrase "in exchange," because by allowing Apple to reduce its Mac market share Intel will certainly ask for something that would more than offset the loss. The story gets interesting here. The iPhone-maker recently created controversy for launching its iPhone 6s and 6s Plus models with A9 SoCs sourced from both Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) and Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM ), resulting in a minor difference in battery life. Samsung made the chips using 14nm process, while TSMC made them using 16nm process. TSMC's version being about 9% larger with same technology inside might result in slightly improved performance due to low heat generation. Cowen & Co. analyst Timothy Arcuri wrote : We believe that Apple had planned to use Samsung for the initial wave of A9 builds, but also developed the Taiwan solution as insurance against yield and allocation issues. Apple is not feeling comfortable with Samsung anymore due to their smartphone rivalry. With Samsung possibly not in the race of developing A10 SoCs for 2016 iPhones (iPhone 7 and 7 Plus) and next-generation iPads, Intel's 14nm process technology could fill the gap. Arcuri believes, "Intel desperately wants the Apple foundry business. This could be a window." This new development, if it really takes concrete shape in the foreseeable future, could be a huge positive for Intel, and for the AppTel alliance as well. I believe the development will certainly take shape. The basis for my belief is that sources with knowledge of Apple's plans revealed earlier this tear that Intel will make LTE chips for the 2016 iPhones instead of Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ). Apple and Qualcomm have an uneasy relationship, according to the sources. I believe Apple is reviving its relationship with Intel for taking advantage of Intel's formidable processor pipeline and its custom processor business. Everybody will believe that if Apple maintains a warm relationship with Intel, it will benefit from Intel's huge investment in processor engineering.
