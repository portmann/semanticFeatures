So I Bought More Intel, And It Came With Some Micron - Micron Technology Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) | Seeking Alpha A month ago I explained that I was looking to buy more Intel but couldn't decide if I should wait. I decided that I should go ahead and buy more shares but in the process I found a strategy within the industry that might enhance my goals. By leveraging the downturn in the chip market I decided to use Micron to play the turnaround in the industry. With the reward outweighing the risk I have decided to use an appreciation in Micron shares to fund my continued accumulation of Intel. A little less than a month ago I told readers that I was interested in adding more Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) to my portfolio but was unsure if it was the right time to start accumulating. I used several factors in determining my dilemma that really could have gone either way. I left it up to my readers to discuss the facts and give me their opinion on the matter. I was glad to see the discussion that ensued even though it wasn't anything earth shattering. The most repeated advice was dollar cost averaging and with what my intentions are with my portfolio. I was leaning toward buying more as I wrote the article but couldn't quite pull the trigger as I didn't know what the stock would do in the short to medium term. However, the resulting price action looked too good to pass up - undoubtedly this was during the broad market downturn. With my accumulation of INTC back in motion, I couldn't help but allocate some to a very close stock but for different reasons. I had been watching Micron (NASDAQ: MU ) from the sideline for some time and read much of what my fellow contributors had to say about its future. To say the least, the stock was - and is - highly divisive. It was difficult to gauge the risk involved at first glance but I felt that at the levels it was dropping to that my reward far outweighed my risk. Now I know my reasons for buying Intel are different than what they are for Micron, which I'll explain shortly, but I felt like I was buying one to support the other - and I don't mean market wise. For Intel I had several reasons why I wanted to accumulate more shares and establish a larger position, one of which was the dividend. If anyone reading this article follows me then they know I share my " Young Investor's Portfolio " which highlights the holdings I have and the goals of increasing dividends by using growth stocks and capital gains to fund the dividend payers. That is primarily how I saw a larger Intel holding fitting into my portfolio - as a solid company that pays dividends. On the other hand, Micron might be the capital appreciation I'm looking for to directly siphon off into Intel. Micron may seem a little out there and be a "dichotomic" strategy with buying Intel even though they share the same industry mechanics. I get it - it doesn't pay a dividend, it has been super volatile, and above all it's being hit the hardest in its industry as DRAM prices fall lower. But that's exactly it - by following Intel closely I couldn't help but see Micron in the background being brought lower and lower. At the levels it was a few weeks ago it was hard not to initiate a position for no other reason than to ride the bottom back up. Granted, I didn't start a position in MU just because I thought I was finding a bottom (I'm not playing that game), I had other reasons on a fundamental basis, too. My goal with Micron is to let the industry cycle back around and wait for an appreciation in the stock as sentiment has hit pretty low. I've read a lot of people saying "buy when others are fearful and sell when others are greedy" and I don't believe that the saying is entirely encompassing of managing a portfolio. But I think it has some truth to it when applied correctly. That's what I think I'm seeing with MU and how it has been down and out. I want to take a closer look at the two and see if what I'm setting up my portfolio to do will actually have the impact I intend. Let's first take a look at the chart of Micron. I bought shares of MU between August 18 and August 24. My only wish was that I bought more closer to the 24th and less near the 18th but I won't complain about market timing because since the 24th MU has been up 21.4%. However, this short-term gain could be wiped out and in fact I would welcome it so as to add more shares, but I won't focus on the short term. Historically speaking MU is sitting at undervalued levels as it trades at only a 5.6 P/E ratio. I decided to get a better idea of what it's relative to its own history and brought the F.A.S.T. graphs tool out much like I did for my Intel article. This time I plan on using another tool in the arsenal in order to tell me what the expectations are for the future. First the earnings graph: Aside from the lumpy historical earnings we can see that MU is clearly below its normal P/E ratio or even where it would be if growth is taken into account. For the sake of being conservative I decided to also take a look at the forward looking graph and judging for myself that even if MU traded for half its typical earnings that it could still mean substantial upside. I think the above chart tells an interesting story. If MU were to change course toward its normal P/E but only stop halfway at around 10.5 it could still be worth $23 to $29, good for a 40-77% appreciation from my cost basis. Now of course I already can see the comments coming in that MU may never get back to historical levels and their earnings may be stagnant for way longer. That's OK, I have time to wait. I'm not looking for a price reversion overnight or even next month. Would I take that? Sure. The point is, though, that by buying in the low $16s my upside is greater than my downside, especially after having gone through the recent market downturn. The real key here is if Micron doesn't fall as far during this industry downturn where in previous downturns this wasn't the case. If the estimates are to be believed it looks like Micron will be well above breakeven and will even see improvement in 2017. If that's how long it takes I'm willing to hold on to my purchase. The Two Stocks Working Together For Me Clearly, as we would expect, Micron leads the way in downside while Intel stays at a much steadier pace. This is most likely due to the exposure each has to the DRAM and NAND chip market and the prices of those components. What I see, though, is Micron having more downside protection built in at these levels while Intel is continuing to chug along not giving up a great deal in terms of investment. This plays into my goals of using the greater upside potential of MU to fund a further investment into INTC and build up my dividend portfolio. When I first was deciding if I was going to start an accumulation of Intel more than a month ago I figured I would just wait for a decent price and hit buy several times over the course of a few weeks. I didn't expect to get more research time in with Micron than Intel and subsequently work on a strategy to capitalize on the industry cycle. I plan on continuing to add more Intel as I see dips in stock price but I also plan on watching the industry more closely, especially the one tied to Micron. I feel the research I was aiming for actually led me to another opportunity in the same industry. Both companies will fulfill different objectives toward my goal and I will watch through the end of the year how that plays out.
