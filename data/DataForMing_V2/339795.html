Peter Ford, who was the UK’s Ambassador in Syria during 2003-2006, was asked by the BBC in their  “The Big Questions” interview on February 14th , whether the current Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would have to be a part of the solution in that country after the war is over, and Ambassador Ford said: “I think sadly, but inevitably, he is. Realistically, Assad is not going to be overthrown. This becomes more clear with every day that passes. Western analysts have been indulging in wishful thinking for 5 years; it’s time to get real, we owe it to the Syrian people to be much more realistic and hard headed about this. The West has to stop propping up the so-called ‘moderate opposition’, which is not moderate at all.” This was quoted by  Almasdar News on February 18th,  which went on to note that, "The frustrated interviewer asked Mr. Ford about 'what we should have done,' and he responded that 'we should have backed off, we should have not tried to overthrow the regime.' Mr. Ford eloquently added that this policy has been 'like a dog returning to vomit.’” The interviewer was clearly anti-Assad, and Ford responded with evident anger by noting (starting at 2:55 on the video) the shocking fact that: “In Aghanistan, Iraq, Libya, like a dog returning to vomit, we go back to [and the audience already was started to clap here], we never saw a secular Arab regime that we didn’t want to overthrow.” He was saying there that we support only non-secular regimes, sectarian regimes, in Arabia, this meaning fundamentalist Sunni governments — especially Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, UAE, the very same regimes that  even the U.S. Secretary of State acknowledged in a 2009 cable that was wikileaked, are the chief regimes that are funding Al Qaeda, ISIS and other jihadist groups.  Ford was noting that the United States and UK strive to keep in power those governments, the ones that are led by royal families that supply the bulk of funding for jihadist groups — jihadists who perpetrate terrorism in the United States and Europe. “We never saw a secular  Arab regime that we didn’t want to overthrow”: Ambassdor Ford was so bold as to imply that our governments are supporting, under the table, the very same ruling families that they know to be funding (as that cable only vaguely referred to them) “Sunni terrorist groups worldwide” (which includes in Western countries, too). The BBC’s interviewer ignored that statement; he wasn’t struck by it, such as to ask: “Why are we supporting the chief funders of Islamic jihad? Why are we overthrowing (or in Syria are trying to overthrow) a secular regime, against which we join foreign jihadist groups in order to overthrow that non-sectarian regime; why are these dogs, as you call the U.S. and UK, returning time and again to that vomit?” This was a live interview program, and so the BBC censors weren’t able to eliminate Ambassador Ford’s responses from the interview; but, instead, the interviewer did his best to interrupt and to talk over Ford’s shocking — and shockingly truthful — assertions about the government (ours) that supposedly represent our  interests (and not the interests of Western oil companies etc.). Ford will probably not be invited again to be on live television in the West to air his views about Syria. Ford’s evident anger at what’s going on, and at the media’s resistance to letting the public know about the reality, appeared to reach near to the edge of his blurting out that ulterior motives have to be behind this addiction to “vomit” — but he was a professional diplomat, and so he was able to restrain himself there. The U.S. Secretary of State who had specifically requested the fundamentalist-Islamic Arab ‘allies’ to stop funding terrorism was Hillary Clinton, the leading candidate now contending for the Democratic Party’s Presidential nomination. Here she was, expressing her current view regarding Syria, in  a recent debate against her Democratic Party opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders: QUESTIONER: In respect to when you take out Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Right now or do you wait? Do you tackle ISIS first? You have said, Secretary Clinton, that you come to the conclusion that we have to proceed on both fronts at once. We heard from the senator just this week that we must put aside the issue of how quickly we get rid of Assad and come together with countries, including Russia and Iran, to destroy ISIS first. Is he wrong? She's still (now after five years, and even though she  knows   that we’re supporting jihadist-backing Arabic royal families and their Shariah-law regimes) comes back to that “vomit”: that "we never saw a secular Arab regime that we didn’t want to overthrow.” She’s an example of this addiction, to that “vomit.” She does this even though,  in October 2014, the man who had collected the mega-donations to Al Qaeda (all of which had been in cash) had detailed, under oath, in a U.S. court proceeding, that the Saud family were the main people who paid the “salaries” of the 9/11 terrorists . The Saud family are now the chief backers of the overthrow-Assad campaign. Do politicians such as Clinton actually represent the Sauds? It’s not only the Bush family who do. What’s exhibited here is a double-scandal: first, that a person such as that would even be a Democratic Party candidate for the U.S. Presidency (and Jeb Bush shares Hillary Clinton’s foreign policy prescriptions, though he’s virtually certain not  to win the Republican Presidential nomination); and, second, that the Western press try to avoid, as much as possible, to expose the fact that this is, indeed, “vomit,” and avoid to explain to their audience the very corrupt governmental and news-media system that enables people such as Ms. Clinton to become and remain a leading Presidential candidate in the United States. Clearly, a person like that isn’t qualified to be in government at all; she’s corrupt, or else incredibly stupid. And no one thinks she’s that stupid. But lots of people accuse her of being  corrupt .

Hillary is a psychopath who was delighted by the gruesome death of Gaddafi.  The US is beholden to the constant war policy of the Neocons to serve Israeli interests in the Middle-East.  That policy is not likely to change and people in the Middle-East will continue to die while the US pretends its bringing democracy to millions of poor, medieval people. http://www.globalresearch.ca/us-sponsored-genocide-against-iraq-1990-201... https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2014/07/30/isis-j30.html While claiming to be committed to a war against ISIS, Washington and its regional allies have time and again proven themselves to be its principal sources of strength. https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2015/06/03/pers-j03.html Sat, 03/05/2016 - 02:50 | 7274498 oncemore Sat, 03/05/2016 - 00:06 | 7274223 The Dogs of Moar Having elected Bush for two terms and then electing Obama for a two terms,  it looks like the American voter also returned to vomit Sat, 03/05/2016 - 00:16 | 7274240 Oldwood Truly intelligent people would be constantly reassessing circumstances and results to ensure some reasonable level of success.

The system unfortunately is designed to promote asshats like  Cameron and the rest of the pond scum in Brussles. Politicians quite often see the light when they get out of office, much like Saul did on the way to Damascus. Someone who would  actually promote friendly relations with those it seeks to slander  purely for monitary gain (MIC) are weeded out. Those who would promote  the demise of NATO and develope a Europeon Defense force most likely  don't make it past sergeant. Europeons have to start defending their interests, not outsiders. A Europeon defense force would be much like Russian Defence force,  enough to give an invader a very bloody nose, but not anywhere near  enough to invade and conqure. To have a person become the head of such  an orginazition would require a political decision. It would require a  leader that breaks the mold and to use a worn out phrase think outside  the box. One such person was Putin. Did Yeltsin expect Putin to take the  direction that he did? I don't know. America now has a chance to pick  someone outside the box. I'm not sure how it would work with Trump as  president, but the rest are a continuation of the same tired old  schtick. He has said that he could work with Putin. It could be a long  shot, but one that could pay off some remarkable dividends down the  road. The other choice at the moment is Clinton, who looks like she  can't wait to start another war. Interesting times we live in indeed. Just noticed an interesting article by that witch Anne Applebaum "Is  this the end of the west as we know it? It is full of the usual BS. To  site one item "we are two or three bad elections away from the end of  NATO". I would hope it is just one good one, with Trump delivering the hammer  blow. Interesting read, from a perspective of knowing the evil amongst  us. Warning, you may need a vomit bag at the ready.

Sat, 03/05/2016 - 02:57 | 7274504 Orc from Mordor You'd better read Karl Marx, he predicted all that as the inevitable stage of capitalism development, it has nothing to do with UK or anything else but greed. It of course has to do with the U.K.  The Queen Bitch and people say like Bertrand Russell have worked to corrupt and kill/enslave billions. They worked/work tirelessly to change the metrics to those that are more corruptible, in order to be able to fill the reality gap with their bullshit. The same ideology has been acquired and utilized for thousands of years since Greek times.  The western oligarchial system arose out of this and it's what has 'learned' to adapt to the times (the American experiment and ascension). Karl Marx was part of the system, he just was a differing part of it.  Think of it like a king of years gone by having his minions be against the policies of another king.  That was Karl Marx.  Is he partially right... sure, but not for the reasons he thought.  For maybe a poor example, if you watch something like Game of Thrones, it's apparent that ALL sides are playing a losing hand because the setup is wrong. Liberty and freedom is more then Karl Marx or Austrian, or WHATEVER.  It's about the human mind being free to overcome limitations human beings place on conquering the physical world (and universal principles discovered or as yet undiscovered) to prosper for themselves and ultimately everyone else. But I understand your point. He had a meme that capitalism will eventually destroy itself.  Not so black and white when it ceases to be capitalism when we stop adhering to capitalism (or something more broadly that represents the tenets of it).  But we ARE at a point where everyone believes we run capitalism and the current tenets of what we call capitalism have produced policy that is so blatantly negative we are now irrefutably destroying ourselves in insane ways. Sat, 03/05/2016 - 04:13 | 7274558 Orc from Mordor You are talking of something which has nothing to do with reality, mate. The reality is the American imperialism which developed from capitalism exactly as Marx wrote a hundred years ago. And all you see now is the result of capitalism and of its ideology - individualism. Sat, 03/05/2016 - 03:50 | 7274538 Volaille de Bresse You're right. Obozo was awarded the Peace Nobel Prize right after he got elected to prevent him from being another war-monger. He didn't follow the advice he led his own Neo-con war and now he's concerned cos he knows that by Janauray 2017 he'll end up in the dustbin of History just like Bush Jr. Godd job Obozo!
