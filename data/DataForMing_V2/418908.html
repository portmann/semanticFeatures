One Man's Quest To Destroy Disney - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Chinese billionaire Wang Jianlin plans to open 15 theme parks in China, a direct challenge to Disney’s theme park in Shanghai. The two entities are fighting for dominance of China’s $610 billion tourism industry. Jianlin’s challenge to Disney is not restricted to China’s borders, as it plans a theme park in Paris to rival Disney's park there. If you have yet to hear of the Wanda Group, it's time to put the organization on your radar. The company made splashes a couple of years back by purchasing the American cinema chain AMC theaters. Once focused on commercial property, it has been aggressively expanding its entertainment segment. The man behind it all is Wang Jianlin, estimated by Forbes to be worth $34.2 billion USD. His latest move into the entertainment industry is focused in his home country. Jianlin has plans to open 15 theme parks throughout China, and has already opened Wanda World, the first one, in the province of Jiangxi. His theme parks are built as part of a complex that host attractions such as an indoor shopping mall, restaurants, a ski resort and movie cinemas. This comes at a time when Disney (NYSE: DIS ) is hoping to enter the market with its first theme park in China, located in the capital of Shanghai. Tickets at Wanda World are about $30 USD, in comparison to a $56 ticket to Shanghai Disney. Jianlin is very open about his quest to take on Disney, aggressively stating that "Over the next 10 to 20 years, Wanda must make Disney unprofitable." He plans to accomplish this through the sheer number of theme parks he is opening. Jianlin believes that Chinese citizens will opt for the closer and less expensive theme park rather than make a trip to Shanghai Disney. In a statement to the press, he referenced the future size of his operations, "One tiger is no match for a pack of wolves." Jianlin is also trying to appeal to the Chinese' sense of national identity. For example , his theme park in Wuhan regularly presents "The Han Show," an acrobatic performance based on the culture of the Han, the largest ethnic block in China. Jianlin referenced an "invasion" of foreign cultures, and declared that, "This craze for Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck is over." So how much of an impact will this have on Shanghai Disney? In my opinion, I doubt it will hurt Disney that much and could even have a positive side effect. I look at this situation and compare it to Six Flags (NYSE: SIX ) in America. Families usually don't decide between Disney and Six Flags because the trips are very different. Six Flags would be a fun day trip, while traveling to Disney is a much larger ordeal that people plan out as a multi-day vacation. Furthermore, I see very few international tourists opting to travel thousands of miles to go to a mid-tier city theme park rather than Shanghai Disney. Jianlin's move could even have a positive effect for Disney's Shanghai location. Many of his theme parks will be located around smaller cities. ( Note : smaller is in reference to the size of Shanghai - the city in Jiangxi where Jianlin's theme park operates is home to well over 2 million residents.) Since China's middle class is relatively new, there will be a lot of residents who have never been to a theme park. If they end up enjoying Jianlin's theme parks, they will have more incentive to travel to Shanghai for Disney's mega-park. Yes, Jianlin certainly seems to have a target placed on Disney. He even has plans to challenge Disney Paris with his own theme park there. However, Disney is a seasoned veteran in this segment while Jianlin has little experience in the field. Disney has learned a lot from building their location in Paris, and will be sure to execute effectively in Shanghai as a result. The park has yet to open and already a million Chinese have visited, whether to see the building progress, walk around the artificial lake, or frequent the restaurants and shops. This is a clear signal that the demand is certainly there for Disney. Even if Jianlin's parks become wildly popular, there's room for more than one player in the business. The Shanghai Disney location has over 330 million people in the surrounding area alone to pull from.
