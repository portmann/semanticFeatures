Amazon's Financial Reporting A Bit Opaque But Not Misleading - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Accusations that Amazon is cooking up the books cannot be substantiated. Its definition and use of Free Cash Flow is both correct and contributing to better insight. As the unique aspects of Amazonâ€™s business model become more apparent, its financial reporting will inevitably become more transparent, turning skepticism into admiration and finally higher valuation. While "Transparent" is a richly awarded Comedy in Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Original TV Series, having received 11 Emmy Awards and two Golden Globes so far, transparency is not usually associated with Amazon's style of financial reporting. However, harsh criticism that Amazon is cooking up the books should be dismissed. Recently, a highly critical tone was struck again in a Seeking Alpha article written by John Spaid, under the title, Capital Lease Confusion, Amazon's Financial Engineering Strategy for Amazon Web Services . It harks back to another article already published in December of last year by SA contributor Slim Shady with the title, Understanding How Amazon's Use of Capital Leases Overstates Its Cash Flow Metrics . Although both articles reveal profound knowledge of financial accounting, they also, in my humble opinion, demonstrate a myopic focus on accounting practices and a neglect of some unique features of Amazon's business model. In both articles, it is being claimed that Amazon deliberately overstates its Free Cash Flow figure by making use of capital leases to finance a big chunk of its capital spending on Property, Plant and Equipment (PP&E). Capex financed by capital leases, as they correctly state, never shows up as a cash outlay in the operating cash flow but are dealt with in the financing section of the Cash Flow Statement. As Free Cash Flow is defined as cash from operations minus capex, free cash flow is overstated by this same amount of capex as well. Moreover, as all capex appears on the asset side on the balance sheet, including the part financed by capital lease (which is capitalized), all depreciation on PP&E is added back to the operating cash flow and consequently included in the free cash flow. Thus, capital lease accounting gives rise to double instances of overstating: part of capex is not included as cash outlay whereas all depreciation is added back to the operating cash flow. The authors admit that, strictly speaking, Amazon is doing nothing wrong but should be less vocal when it shows off its FCF in presentations and during conference calls. While Amazon's use of FCF may be formally correct, they contend that in its unannotated version, it is grossly and intentionally misleading. In my opinion, it is a difficult position to defend that a correct application of accounting principles can be at the same time highly misleading. In spite of all the harsh words used and suspicions made, the accusation that Amazon is cooking up the book cannot be substantiated. Amazon's three measures of Free Cash Flow It is all about the definition of FCF one uses. There are different concepts of FCF and in the case of Amazon, three of them are especially relevant. In its SEC 10-K reports, Amazon takes great effort in annotating the FCF concept it uses. In fact, it explicitly reports the FCF at three different levels which logically follow from each other: 1) the classic FCF (operating cash minus 'out of cash' capital spending), 2) the same as the classic FCF but minus repayments on capital and financial leases and 3) the classic FCF minus all capex irrespective of being paid out of cash or financed by a capital lease agreement. Applied to the FY 2014 figures, the FCF1= $1.949 million, FCF2 = $529 million while FCF3= minus $2,194 million. There is no mystery or concealment. It is for everyone to see and free to interpret in the best way he can. Now, we should not expect every investor to read the SEC 10-K report from cover to cover, but we can be sure that any financial analyst who takes his or her task seriously, knows where to find this information and will use it in understanding the company. Indeed, there is something to learn from these different FCF concepts as applied by Amazon. For that, we should not solely stare at accounting figures but must use some imagination as well and try to reconstruct and understand Amazon's business and earnings model. Amazon has grown into a rather complicated business model in which it currently combines at least three different companies: 1) it is an online retailer, 2) a retail and wholesale enabler and fulfiller for others and 3) a provider of web services and cloud computing. This list is probably not exhaustive as we may already add a streaming media company/content producer as well. One day it may even start operating a parcel delivery company of its own when it has enough scale to compete with UPS (NYSE: UPS ) and FedEx (NYSE: FDX ) (which is imminent, I think). All these activities are being developed within the same model of an online retailer which actually does no longer fit them but is nevertheless being maintained as to make it not too easy for competitors to understand (and copy) what Amazon is doing. As the highly disruptive company it is, Amazon is the natural focal point for many who wish to grab a share of the fast growing online retail market or incumbents who must defend their position. As Jeff Bezos demonstrated himself, in the first pioneering years there were, besides creative imagination and true entrepreneurship, hardly any entry barriers to newcomers. The only really effective one, scale, was still to be established. Obtaining that scale necessitated full focus on growing volume first rather than earnings. It also required that Bezos kept his cards close to the chest. An online business is open to any visitor, whether customer or competitor. It is true that Amazon's figures are not as transparent as analysts might wish but shareholders have in that respect the same interest as the company and its founder. Shareholders have long been left in the dark about the size, the growth and profitability of Amazon's web services. Since the first quarter of this year, now that this cloud computing business has established itself as the uncontestable market leader, shareholders and others are allowed more insight into this part of Amazon. Would it have been in the shareholder's interest when Amazon would have been utterly transparent at an early stage about its strategy? How would its main competitors, deep pocketed giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), IBM (NYSE: IBM ), have reacted? They too have been taken by surprise. And a positive surprise it has been, at least for Amazon's shareholders. My take on this is that the reason why Amazon willingly directed (as it still does) all attention to the formal, first version of FCF, was that the company could not afford to report on new businesses as transparently as a company would do at a much more mature stage of development. The use of capital leases must also be regarded in that respect. It allowed for developing and financing revolutionary web and cloud services without attracting too much attention to them. With hindsight, investors can only admit that it was the best thing and in their best interest to do. A true economic rationale for Amazon's use of conventional Free Cash Flow But there is also a true economic rationale and justification to still keep using the conventional FCF as Amazon does in its quarterly presentation. It reveals that it is growing fast and that the '12 trailing months' figures have reached a level of $4,474 million in the second quarter of this year. This figure expresses closest the free cash flow of the oldest core of Amazon, i.e. its online retail business. It would have blurred the true insight in this part of the business if the large investments in AWS would have been treated in the same way as the capital spending in the online retail business. Most of the capital spending at AWS is in servers, which have an expected useful life of three years and are depreciated accordingly. On the other hand, AWS's revenue are essentially based on some form of subscription and payment as you go. This business appears to be quite sticky. Customers face serious exit barriers, as Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) who is one of the largest among them, will acknowledge. Once a customer, always a customer seems to be a reality here (the same holds, by the way, also for FBA, fulfilled by Amazon, the part of the online retail business in which Amazon acts as an enabler and fulfiller on behalf of third parties). Because of these special characteristics, it is quite appropriate to have this part of capital spending financed by capital lease agreements. By doing so, Amazon not only separates capex in retail business from web services, thus giving a better analytic insight into the latter's true FCF than when everything had been lumped together. But by matching AWS's revenue with the capital lease repayments (which are almost all related to AWS), analysts obtain the insight that this part of the business, as highly profitable as it already may be, does not generate positive cash flows yet. Again, as in online retail, Amazon is with AWS fully focused on obtaining scale and must therefore keep allocating considerable amounts on capex. But most importantly, this treatment of the FCF underscores the favorable characteristics of delivering cloud computing services - (1) perfect pricing based on fully measured usage, (2) stickiness of customers, and (3) immediate and continuous scalability. Amazon does not need to reinvest its fast growing positive FCF from its retail business in AWS but can fully rely on capital leases whenever the need arises. In a way, the main rationale of cloud computing for users, which is using computing power when and where needed at the required scale without investment, has been extended to AWS as a whole and has become a highly favorable feature of Amazon's business model. If this feature of Amazon's model is well understood, criticism may turn into appreciation. In the table below, it is shown that not only FCF-1, the conventional free cash flow definition that Amazon rightfully focuses on, is positive and has been growing sharply during the last 10 quarters but also that FCF-2 has begun following a comparable path. Only FCF-3, the cash flow definition that comprises all PP&E that is acquired under capital lease, is still negative. However, this final cash flow version will, because of the high profitability of web services, probably turn positive rather sooner than later. In case it would remain negative much longer, it would be because of continued extraordinary growth, in which case, it would be a highly positive factor in the valuation of Amazon's profits. Specific asset related capital leasing does not set constraints on valuation, it is automatically extended upon purchase of equipment and does not interfere with other parts of Amazon. It is the most appropriate form of financing for AWS in its current high growth phase. Beyond Free Cash Flow: fast growing earnings This year, Amazon's revenue will exceed the $100 billion level. It might be the tipping point, at least in the USA, where delivery costs could switch from costs into revenue as the part of retail sales fulfilled by Amazon (FBA), which have already surpassed Amazon's own retail activities, will grow steeper, reaching sufficient scale to sustain a closely knit delivery network. In that situation, delivery charges carried on to customers may outstrip total delivery costs. The home market will be the first to reach this tipping point followed by overseas operations later on. AWS, and most likely FBA too, command considerably higher margins than Amazon's own retail activities, which might at some future point be seen as the necessary start that positioned Amazon to becoming in the end a pure trade enabler and fulfiller in the broadest sense, including all computing and software services for online retailers and service providers to conduct their business. The overall operating profit margin will be in accordance with this high service level and, at a mature stage, is poised to reach a multiple of that of traditional retailers in their heyday. Amazon's revenue has grown since 2011 by an average 22.8% per year. With all the recently extended delivery services under Prime and the international expansion well underway, it is highly probable that a 15-20% revenue growth rate can be maintained for many years to come. That part of the equation is the least hard to fill in. It will all depend on the operating profit margin how this will work out in future net income. If that profit margin would be around 10% or above, which I think is quite reasonable to expect, the stock is not excessively priced and still offers good LT potential.
