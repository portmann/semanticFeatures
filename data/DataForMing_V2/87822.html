Boeing: A Bright Market Outlook For The Jet Maker - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Boeing now expects demand for over 38,000 airframes. High demand comes from booming Asian market, Europe and North America. Prior to the biannual Paris Air Show that started on Monday, Boeing (NYSE: BA ) increased its current market outlook (CMO) by 3.5%. The world's largest jet maker now expects demand for 38,050 airframes valued at $5.6 trillion for the coming 20 years. The world economy is expected to show moderate growth while India and the U.S. will show strong growth. The Brazilian economy is expected to decline, as the country's economic growth is falling short of expectations and the government does not seem to be able to turn this around. The Russian economy will slink, probably caused by the embargoes against the country combined with low oil prices that put it in a deep crisis. All in all, demand is supported by expansion in Asia, Europe and North America. Middle East is a pretty valuable market, considering the low number of airlines the region has, but the high sums of money these airlines have to spend. Cargo traffic is expected to grow by 4.7% annually while passenger traffic will grow at an annual rate of 4.9%. Both figures are close to historical growth rate of 5%. Figure 2: Demand per aircraft type in terms of units and value (Source: Dhierin-Perkash Bechai ) The figure above shows that 70% of the demand consists of single aisle aircraft such as the Boeing 737 MAX and Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSF ) ( OTCPK:EADSY ) A320neo. In terms of value, the single aisle segment represents 50% of the value of the demand in the coming 20 years. Although more and more manufacturers are trying to access this market segment, I think orders will almost be equally split between Boeing and Airbus. The large widebody segment represents 1% of the demand in terms of units and 4% in terms of value. So the large widebody market is quite small and has been a slow and risky market segment. Currently, only 2 aircraft types are active in the segment: the Airbus A380 and the Boeing 747-8. The Airbus A380 is a multi-billion development. Airbus forecasted demand for 1,700 airframes in the large widebody market segment. Fifteen years after the first order was announced, Airbus secured a little over 300 orders. The Boeing 747-8 had significantly lower development costs, but also Boeing is struggling to secure orders for its largest aircraft. Boeing has an advantage with its freighter variant of the 747-8, which has a unique lifting capability. So, with the large widebody representing only a minor part of the total demand, almost half of the demand in terms of value comes from small and medium widebody aircraft. The small widebody segment represents 13% of the demand in terms of units and 22% of the demand in terms of value. Boeing focused on this segment with the Boeing 787. The Boeing 787 has had major cost overruns, but the outlook is quite good. So there are a lot of orders that can be won by Boeing in this segment. Airbus on the other hand has the Airbus A330, which does quite well. Additionally, Airbus will ease into the production of the Airbus A330neo, which can count on a good number of orders as well and will directly compete with the Boeing 787. Airbus also has the A350-900, which gained 600 orders so far. So the battle between Boeing and Airbus in this segment is fierce. On the medium widebody market, Boeing is dominating with the Boeing 777 and the Boeing 777X, and 787-10 should add to that dominant position. Airbus only has the Airbus A350-1000 on offer in this segment. The medium widebody market represents 9% of the demand in terms of units, but 22% in terms of values. So both Boeing and Airbus want to be dominant in this segment. Currently, the advantage is at Boeing's side. The small and medium widebody segments are important segments, and it is also in these segments where Boeing and Airbus will clash. Boeing has the Boeing 787 and the Boeing 777X to battle the Airbus A330neo and Airbus A350. Boeing has almost 1,400 unfilled orders in these 2 segments combined while Airbus has almost 1,100 unfilled orders. So looking at the orders, Boeing has a small advantage. Boeing and Airbus both will gain from a better outlook since none of the companies can supply all the demand by itself. Boeing and Airbus will fight for orders in the coming years. Looking at the product line up , I do think that Boeing will have a slight advantage, but currently neither of the jet makers can be marked as a clear winner. Looking at the fleet growth, it can be seen that airline fleets will show robust growth in Asia (Asia-Pacific and Middle East) and the emerging markets (Africa and Latin America). The fleets in these regions will more than double in the coming 20 years while Europe, North America and CIS will show moderate growth. Combining all regions, the total fleet will double. Figure 3: Division demand between growth and fleet renewal (Source: Dhierin-Perkash Bechai) Figure 3 shows that demand is supported by a healthy mix of demand to support growth and demand for fleet renewal. 42% of the potential orders are required to support growth while 58% is needed for fleet renewal. In the regions that show moderate fleet growth, demand is driven by fleet renewal, as can be expected. In these regions, 50%-70% of the demand is driven by fleet renewal. In the other regions, the demand is driven by growth. In these regions, 70%-82% of the demand is driven by fleet growth. Figure 4: Demand per region (Source: Dhierin-Perkash Bechai) Figure 4 shows that although fleets in the emerging markets and Asia will double, the Asia Pacific region, Europe and North America still lead the way in terms of absolute demand, as well as value. The Middle East represents a relative high value as most of the demand consists of widebody aircraft, which naturally have a higher list price. The fact that Boeing increased its outlook is a good sign for long-term investors, as it shows that the current record high orders books and deliveries are not incidental. Asia, North America and Europe still lead the way in terms of absolute demand (units and value). The combined emerging regions will need more airframes than the Middle East, showing that this is not a market that should be ignored. New players (Comac and Bombardier ( OTCPK:BDRAF ) ( OTCQX:BDRBF )) will access the single aisle market soon, but as these manufacturers do not have high production volumes yet and will not have this for a while either, Boeing and Airbus mostly will be competing. In this segment, I expect orders to be divided almost equally with a possible slight advantage for Airbus. On the more profitable widebody market, Boeing and Airbus will be the only "players". Comac has shown interest in accessing the market, but given the premature state the Chinese aviation industry is in, it won't be able to access this market segment soon. On this market, I do think Boeing has the advantage. Airbus optimized the A330, which is one last squeeze out of the A330 concept, and Boeing has the Boeing 787 that should get performance improvements in the coming years. Airbus has brought the A350 on the market and has secured a good amount of orders. Boeing responded with the Boeing 777X, which puts Airbus in a difficult spot as it does not have the range and lifting capability of the Boeing 777X. Given the current market outlook, it is a good time to invest in Boeing and Airbus for the long term. Airbus might have a slight advantage on the single aisle market, but I expect Boeing to be more dominant in the widebody segment.
