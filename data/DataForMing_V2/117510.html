Apart from that, Disney expects that the project would support an average of 2,600 local jobs a year, and lead to the creation of 2,100 permanent jobs. Either way this is a win-win situation for Disney. The entertainment industry is an influential part of our everyday lives. The entertainment and media industry around the world has grown larger over the years to stand at $1.74 trillion at the end of 2014. Over the last few decades, the growth pace of the industry has improved significantly primarily due to globalization, enriched lifestyles, more spending on entertainment and availability of a broad range of services. Moreover, in the recent past, digital growth has been the main point to focus for entertainment companies, despite facing problems such as urging consumers to pay for the content and transitioning towards new digital platforms. Disney has taken full advantage and resultantly the company has experienced impressive growth over the years. Walt Disney Company is the leading media giant in the world today, with multiple subsidiaries and worldwide presence. The company operates in five business segments: Media Networks, Parks and Resorts, Studio Entertainment, Consumer Products and Interactive. The impressive performance across all the businesses has enabled Disney to witness solid earnings growth over the years. The strong fundamentals of Disney, impressive business models and presence in the continuously growing industry are the factors behind the company's consistent growth, and thus tremendous returns to its shareholders. The share price has surged 28% YTD and 38% over last twelve months outperforming the industry peers and S&P 500. The stock is trading at forward PE of 20.39x which is inexpensive considering Disney's potential to grow further as the company is consolidating few of its business segments to ignite more growth from these segments. Since September 2011, the share price has been showing consistent upward trend without any major drop, but how far this upward momentum is expected to continue is pretty linked with the company's financial performance. Looking at its historical performance, Disney's revenue and net income has increased at a CAGR of 6.4% and 17.3% between 2010 and 2014 , respectively. Thus, over the years, a continuous surge in share price is pretty justified and reflects a strong correlation between the company's financial and share price performance. Going forward, the company's earnings are expected to increase by 26% and 15.15% this year and over next five years, respectively. On the other hand, according to PWC report , total worldwide entertainment and media revenues will rise at a compound annual growth rate (OTCPK: CAGR ) of 5.1% over the coming five years, from US$1.74 trillion in 2014 to US$2.23 trillion in 2019. The industry dynamics are favorable and Disney has positioned itself accordingly. The growing traffic at theme parks, not to forget Shanghai Disneyland opening next spring , upcoming Marvel superhero and Disney movies, consolidation of interactive and consumer products segment and the success of Playmation would be enough to generate healthy earnings. Disney is using innovative ideas to increase its fortune, a tried and tested ideology for many successful companies over the past decades. Despite being fourth largest of its five divisions by revenue, Disney is positioning its consumer products segment to show rapid growth along with studio entertainment. The company is planning to bring "Playmation" toys in October, which would be the combination of the company's popular movie franchises with sensors and Kinds' imagination. The first set will be based on The Avengers, while Star Wars and Frozen are expected to arrive in 2016 and 2017, respectively. The company's strategy to introduce toys equipped with digital technology makes sense, as wearable technology is becoming increasingly popular. According to Kareem Daniel , senior vice president of strategy and business development at Disney Consumer Products; "We use digital technology to make active physical play more exciting for kids. Kids love to play make-believe and become superheroes, and Playmation offers lots of different ways to play." The Playmation can add pretty good numbers to the company's earnings. The expected selling price of its Avenger set is $120, with each additional figure for $15. If Disney just converts a conservative 10% of its movie receipts into Playmation sales, it could easily generate $300 million in revenue. Disney's business segments performance is interlinked to some extent, particularly studio entertainment, consumer products, and interactive media. Recently, Disney has announced the consolidation which is likely to play a significant role in translating soaring growth of both segments. Consolidating the interactive media with consumer products is a smart move to streamline the business units to maximize the growth potential. This amalgamation will strengthen the consumer products business which generates around 8% of the company's total revenue and will further improve the growth prospects with greater synergy. Disney will report the combined revenue from the beginning of the new fiscal year and the consolidated unit is expected to garner yearly revenues of $5.28 billion, with operating income of approximately $1.47 billion. Currently, Disney offers a dividend yield of 1.13% up from 0.99% previous yield. Disney recently announced to raise the dividend by 15% on an annualized basis and will pay dividend twice a year. The current dividend amount is $1.15 per share and 15% raise translates into a dividend of $1.32 per share. The first payment of 66 cents, covering the first six months of the year, will be made July 29 . Disney is a long-term play because it offers handsome capital gains and now improved dividend stream twice a year is also on its way. The growth story of Disney is likely to continue in the future because it has top movie names in the pipeline for the next five years which is good for both investors and customers.
