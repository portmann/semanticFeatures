ETF Hub Jan  9 2016, 14:30 ET | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor With one day down in its wide release in China, the Disney (NYSE: DIS ) film has grossed about $33M , the best Saturday opening day ever in China, and the best opening day for Disney there. By comparison, Jurassic World -- the No. 3 global grosser that The Force Awakens will surely pass this weekend -- opened to $17.24M on a June Wednesday. It ended up with about $229M total in China, while global No. 1 Avatar grossed about $210M in the country in 2010. China is the last territory in the world to receive the film. A Hollywood Reporter poll suggested theater operators expect the Star Wars film to gross between $200M and $330M in China. The Force Awakens is already the top-grossing domestic film of all time at $781M, having passed Avatar's $760.5M on Wednesday. Previously: Disney makes it official: 'Star Wars' is all-time domestic box-office king (Jan. 06 2016) Is this going to affect the stock price? I don't think so. Strange market it is. This is surely positive news for DIS and broader market but these analysts are so fixated on something else. I'm super long DIS but I see too many misleading statements about Star Wars' impact on the company's financials. SW could take in twice as much as Avatar globally and DIS would still drop if ESPN concerns turn out to be valid. Yes, in the long run this is a great investment, but I think people need to remember that as Diversified as Disney is, broadcast media is by far the main driver of earnings, and that is led by ESPN. $33 million for one day in a huge place like China doesn't sound like much. I wonder what the ticket prices are. Is it low ticket prices, lack of access to a theater, lack of disposable income, or not having the following it does in North America and the rest of the world? China was closed off during the first Star Wars phenomena.... 3 million in one day doesn't sound like much in China.  after all, their population is 4x that of the US.And, a ticket price of  $10-11 is only slightly below that of the US. Considering the standard of living in China, what is the potential market at that price? not much. All we will hear is how next years comps will will be too hard to beat because of all of the late 2015 sales success.  2016 is going to be a year of everyone turning every piece of good news into bad news, and bad news into catastrophic news.  Probably need to tune out the media and analysts commentary for a while. missed streets expectations of 33.01mil. DIS should sell off 85% on Monday. Chinese consumer is the weakest it's ever been. Going all the way to $2B, possibly taking over Titanic. Rogue One will make another $1B later in 2016. Not bad at all. I'm willing to bet Ep VIII will make it to $3B and smash Avatar in 2017. It'll be a success, but I don't think it's far from a guarantee that Rogue One pulls in $1 billion.  A big part of the draw of this Star Wars was the original cast being in it, Rogue One won't have that same advantage. Too bad the analysts were looking for an elevendy billion dollar one day China opening to upgrade Disney from a sell to underperform... Hey look everyone, the Chinese consumer isn't spending money...  oh wait.  Like someone else said, should be good for a few percent downward.  This market is hilariously irrational, and great time for investors, patient investors to purchase shares of an amazing company. 3 reasons for the recent slide in DIS Disney is 33% more expensive than many of its peers on a (past) P/E basis. StarWars aside Disney's growth is slowing. Expecting an expensive company to buck the trend of a falling market based on a single product's success really requires a lot of Hopium. Oooh, the Chiefs are playing the Texans in a Wild Card game. Oh, cannot watch it because we do not get ESPN. Why? Because like millions of others I canceled the TV package that included ESPN due to it being unreasonably priced. Who owns ESPN? ABC. Who owns ABC? Disney. QED.
