The 737 MAX And The 787 Will Determine Boeing's Success - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Despite volatility and some well-known concerns, Boeing remains a solid investment case. Slowing orders donâ€™t make me worry and the backlog guarantees revenue growth for the next years. Boeing (NYSE: BA ) gave an outlook about its goals and the trends for the next years in the recent investor conference . The company said its aspirational goal was to increase the consolidated segment margin to the mid-teens, up from an average of 10% in 2013-2015. This is truly challenging, and I would already be happy if Boeing could reach the 2014 margin again while growing revenue. The one thing Boeing investors should not question is revenue growth. Until 2020, the key drivers will be increasing the production of the 737 to ultimately 57 units per month and for the 787 from 12 to 14 airframes. On the downside, there is the 777, an important cash contributor which will be replaced by the 777X from 2020 on. This leads to fewer planes built in the next years and a free cash flow gap that needs to be compensated by other models. The production rate will be cut to 7 per month in 2017, and with 198 outstanding orders at the end of April, the key question is how smooth the transition can be. In the fourth-quarter earnings call , Boeing's management stated that 80% of the available production slots until transition to the 777X are sold out at this rate. I will start with the programs that are not important enough to really move the needle, and the first one is the 747-8. The latest generation of the Jumbo has not been successful, and the production rate will be cut to only 0.5 airframes from this September on. Without a significant number of new orders, Boeing can close this chapter in a few years. The 767 on the other side is good news, and last year's FedEx (NYSE: FDX ) order allows Boeing to increase the production rate to 2.5 per month. Although this number is too low to have a considerable impact either, the 767 is a high margin product and a nice cash contributor. Then there is the KC-46, another embarrassing chapter in Boeing's history. The program is characterized by cost overruns, delays and charges almost on a quarterly basis. The latest disappointment is the news that the delivery will be delayed again - only three weeks after Boeing said that the program was on track. With 179 KC-46s delivered by 2028 and a volume of $46B, the project is quite substantial, and Boeing had to write down $1.5B in combined charges so far. The program is a nuisance which questions Boeing's management as well as project execution capabilities, but it is fortunately not a disaster. When considering the scope and the duration of the program, Boeing still can earn money with it. The 737 is the first key to Boeing's success and so far; there are no clouds on the horizon for the 737 MAX. The program seems to progress very smoothly compared to Boeing standards, and the first delivery is now expected in the first half of 2017, at least three months earlier than original Q3 target. The Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSF ) ( OTCPK:EADSY ) A320neo on the other side, which outsold the 737 MAX, had a very difficult start as engine problems delayed the first deliveries. The issues are still not fixed, and the operating aircraft do not perform as expected. Qatar Airways, the original launch carrier, refused to take the airplane. The airline might consider to cancel the order and switch to the 737 MAX instead. In any case, Airbus is falling behind schedule, and the necessary engine fixes will take at least until the end of the year which opens up Boeing the opportunity to gain ground, provided that the MAX runs smooth. As a result of the transition to the MAX, the 737 production rate will be kept constant at 42 airframes per month in 2016 before increasing to 47 in 2017, 52 in 2018 and finally 57 in 2019. Building test airplanes and the production of the first units for the 2017 delivery of the MAX limits output and deliveries of the 737NG in 2016. This is an effect which impacts Boeing's 2016 performance, but it should be forgotten next year. All in all, the annual production rate of the 737 will increase by 60 in 2017, 120 in 2018 and 180 units in 2019, and all of them will contribute to top and bottom lines as well as free cash flow. The future of the 787 is the second key factor for Boeing (and its shareholders). It is the most important part of the equation, but also the biggest uncertainty. After a disastrous start of the program, at least the production numbers seem to finally fit. Boeing has already reached the 12 per month production rate that was targeted for 2016, and the next goal will be the ramp-up to 14 by the end of the decade. The decisive question which plays an important role to meet the company's goals in terms of margin and cash generation is how fast costs will come down. The cash flow from the 787 will have to fund a noticeable share of Boeing's dividends and the buybacks in the years to come. In this context, I am actually not too concerned about the deferred costs and whether the program will ultimately be able to recover these costs at the projected volume of 1,300 units. One has to realize that the money has already been spent, and it will not negatively impact future cash flows any more. Neither will possible write-offs if they occur. I believe that the aircraft has the potential to become an important cash contributor for Boeing, but this requires that productivity and profitability increase quickly, at least before the 777X enters production. The old 777 will leave a cash flow gap that needs to filled, and this will be the job of the 787. While it is far too early to judge how the 777X project will develop, even under a best case assumption (which is anyhow questionable, given Boeing's track record), the 777X will need time to become profitable and cash flow positive. In summary, the 737 remains Boeing's most important model, at least for the next decade. It represents two-thirds of Boeing's deliveries, and that share will even increase over the next years with the growing number of units. As the 777 production will slow down from 2017 on, its cash contribution will diminish, a development which will be further accelerated due to higher rebates that Boeing has to offer to fill the remaining production slots. The 787 has to jump in to fill the gap, and with a production rate of 12 per month, it will become the wide-body with the highest production rate ever. Aircraft orders are slowing down, and there is some speculation whether the demand has peaked for the foreseeable future. This could very well be the case, and the number of net orders might fall short of deliveries for the next years. However, even if this happens, it is no reason to be worried today, as Boeing's order backlog buffers ups and downs in the airline's ordering patterns. Air travel will continue to grow above GDP which means that in the long run and adjusted for short-term fluctuations, the demand for new airplanes will increase. At least in 2015, Boeing's net orders of 768 still exceeded deliveries, and even if in 2016 and 2017 the ratio drops below one, it is no big deal for me. Looking at the historic pattern, orders peaked in 2007 and exceeded 1,400 for the first time to collapse during the Great Recession shortly after. It took until 2012 for net orders to climb above 1,000 again, and that level was held for three years until 2014. Surely, the years 2012-2014 were a period of exceptional demand, but there is no particular need to worry that Boeing's production lines will not be filled in the foreseeable future. The annual net order volume in the 11-year period stands at 943 units, and it will take Boeing roughly until 2019 to increase its actual production to that level. A very important question in this context is how big Boeing's piece of the cake is going to be in the future. Airbus outsold Boeing in the recent years, and particularly the A320neo family was a big success. However, one should keep in mind that Airbus' program started earlier (December 2010) than Boeing's (August 2011). This explains at least partly the gap between 4,510 orders for Airbus and only 3,090 for Boeing. More importantly, Airbus has yet to find a way to turn the growing backlog of its top sellers into financial success. While Boeing has ramped up production considerably over the past years, Airbus is falling behind. Airbus gains orders and orders, but fails to increase capacity to ultimately build those planes. This is true for the two most important models, the A320 and the A350. A smooth start for the 737 MAX and Airbus' inability to reduce the backlog for the A320 could help Boeing to bring the order balance more towards a 50:50 ratio. All in all, there is limited differentiation between Airbus' and Boeing's portfolio. The chapter of the four-engine wide-bodies will be closed soon. The A380 is as dead as the 747, and if Airbus really decides to develop an A380neo, it will occupy capacity and resources, but it will never pay off. In the "middle of market", Airbus currently has an edge over Boeing with the A321neo LR. The same is true for the A330 and the A330neo which are (low cost) alternatives to the 787 or A350 on shorter long-haul routes. On the other side, Boeing is uniquely positioned in what is remaining of the large wide-body segment with the 777 and later with the 777X which I believe is a considerable advantage. Operating cash flow is Boeing's only key metric that increased steadily over the past years, and it is important to stress its relevance. Not earnings pay the dividend or buy back shares, it is the free cash flow. Boeing is in very solid financial shape despite all the charges and cost overruns, and the company has maintained a net cash position, although shareholder distributions increased substantially over the years. The company returns 100% of its free cash flow, last year $6.8B were spent on buybacks and $2.5B on dividends. Boeing's dividend more than doubled in the past three years, and on an annualized rate, Boeing pays $4.36 which is good for a 3.4% yield. Fueled by an increasing cash flow, I expect that the dividend can grow over the next years at a double-digit rate. The 2016 cash flow guidance of $10B was confirmed which would be an increase from $9.4B in 2015. Boeing remains one of my core holdings, and I see no reasons to question this status in the next few years. Honestly, I would not buy the stock at the present levels, but the nice thing about Boeing's volatility is that attractive entry points appear on a regulator basis. For me, levels below $120 are occasions when I am always tempted to add to my position.
