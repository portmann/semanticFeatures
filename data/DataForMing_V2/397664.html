A Sober Approach To Valuing Amazon - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Amazon has been up 10% after the results of Q1 2016 due to higher than expected earnings driven by cloud services business. But still earnings were a mere $1.07 per share in Q1 2016 and operating margin is in the range of 2-4%. Up until the last few years, it had been difficult for analysts to arrive at a correct valuation for Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ). It was due to the fact that despite being 20 years old, Amazon never produced any significant positive earnings. Profits, if any, were plowed back into the company on the back of the audacious dreams of its CEO, Jeff Bezos. It was only since last year that analysts have seen positive earnings in consecutive quarters and the stock has sky rocketed since then. In fact, since 16th Jan 2015 to 29th April 2015, the stock has surged 127% (from $290.74 on 16th Jan to $659.59 on 29th April) and in spite of that analysts are still maintaining a buy recommendation on the stock. Amazon was started by Jeff Bezos in a garage in 1995. After 20 years, it has become a mammoth with $113bn of revenue TTM. However, in spite of being a two decade old company it reported earnings of $1.28 per share at an operating margin of 2.7%. At the current share price of $659.59, it has been valued by investors at a staggering $310bn! Just to put it in perspective, it is more than the market cap of Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ), Kroger (NYSE: KR ) and Target (NYSE: TGT ) combined. The lofty valuations have been fueled to a large part due to the prospect of growth offered by Amazon. This growth would come from venturing into new businesses like media (television shows, movies, and comics), hardware devices (Kindle readers, Fire tablets, Fire TVs and Echo) and cloud services (Amazon Web Services or AWS). AWS has been a major game changer for Amazon and in a period of 3 years has contributed 40% to operating income in spite of contributing less than 10% to total revenues. It has been responsible for the 10% surge in share price recently after the results of Q1 2016. However, can these dreams justify the mammoth valuation of Amazon? Let's have a look. Amazon has a TTM P/E of 272.1 whereas the industry average is at 32.9. However, since it has very low earnings of $2.49 per share TTM, P/E multiple is not a good metric to determine its valuation. If we look at Price/Book Value, again it is pretty high for Amazon at 21.1 as compared to the industry average of 7.5. The same is true of Price/Sales at 2.8 versus the industry average of 1.9. However, as per Amazon the best metric to compare them is Price/Free cash flow (NYSE: PCF ). As per their 10-K report, " Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows per share. Free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital and cash capital expenditures, including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment. Increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partially offset by investments we make in longer-term strategic initiatives." Amazon has a P/CF of 28.2 which is near its 5 year average. This is three times more than the industry average (8.3) and two times more than the S&P 500 average (11.8). Even on the basis of FCF, a parameter that has maximum focus from Amazon, the valuation of Amazon looks higher. Amazon's Comparison with Major Retailers (Source: Morningstar, all figures are TTM) Note that Amazon has one of the lowest operating margins among all retailers. None of these multiples, with the exception of PEG ratio, seem to justify the extraordinary valuation of Amazon. Let's focus on Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) valuation and determine a range at which its valuation would make sense. Estimated Value of Amazon's Share from DCF Valuation After assuming a 22% growth rate in revenue for the first 5 years from 2016 onwards (current 3 year average growth rate is 20.5%) and using a target pre-tax operating margin of 10% in 2026 (current operating margin is 4.83%), we get an estimated value of $533.67 per share. Here, operating income has been taken before share compensation thereby giving a higher operating margin of 4.83% TTM for 2016. It is a separate discussion in itself whether share compensation should be considered for calculating operating income. For the purpose of this discussion, we have added share compensation to operating income because it is not a direct operating expense. This DCF valuation indicates that the stock is overpriced by 24%. This valuation is based upon two main assumptions - revenue growth rate and target pre-tax operating margin. This is a highly optimistic scenario and is based upon exceptional performance by AWS. AWS currently comprises ~10% of total revenues for Amazon. In order to give a growth rate of 22%, AWS has to grow by more than 40% each year for the next 5 years. Notably, AWS sales have increased by 69%, 49% and 70% in 2013, 2014 and 2015 respectively. So, the 22% revenue growth rate looks achievable. Now, let's look at the target pre-tax operating margin. If we look at retail and media sector in US, the weighted average (in the ratio of Amazon's revenues of media and retail) operating margin comes to 7.38%. In the long run if Amazon acquires sufficient market share and stops the heavy discounting policy, it can hit that number. But in order to reach the 10% mark, the high margin AWS business has to fire on all cylinders and contribute to at least 25% of total sales in next 10 years. In the last 5 quarters, the average margin for the AWS business has been 24%. Segment-Wise Results of Amazon for the Last 5 Quarters (Source: Company Filings) Scenario Analysis for Understanding Current Market Valuation Still we are nowhere near the current share price. Let us look at scenario analysis and determine the situations in which an Amazon buy will prove to be in the money. The chart consists of Forecasted Revenues in 2026 and Target pre-tax operating margin for Amazon to hit the price indicated in the inside cells. I have highlighted the scenarios where the valuation price is higher than the current market price. Such scenarios are possible only if: The revenues of Amazon exceed $700bn in 2026 at the target operating margin of 10%. In this scenario, Amazon would become the largest company in the world, overtaking Wal-Mart, with current revenues of $482bn TTM, by a huge margin. It seems quite unlikely. The other possible scenario is that Amazon becomes equal to Wal-Mart in revenue and increases its operating margin to 15%. This can happen if the high margin AWS contributes to 60% of Amazon's total revenues, growing from $10bn to $300bn. Also, seems quite unlikely to happen. The only scenario in which this is possible is, if Amazon comes up with other successful bets like AWS which increase its operating margin significantly or Amazon becomes a monopoly, eliminates the competition, and uses its market power to charge higher prices. Amazon offers great products and services like Kindle e-Reader, Amazon Prime, 1-day delivery, AWS, etc. It is one of the most customer-centric companies in the world. In spite of operating for 20 years, they still have a revenue growth rate of more than 20%, which is unseen in the market. They are led by a charismatic leader who is not afraid to venture where others have feared to tread. Despite all these qualities, the euphoria around Amazon has masked the real value of its stock. It doesn't make great investing sense to buy into Amazon at the current prices as the stock is overvalued by a minimum of 24%. Moreover, there is too much volatility for a savvy investor, as Amazon reinvests all its earnings into business every alternate year. You can see earnings turning negative every alternate year in the image below. Also, notice the spike in volatility at the time of every earning announcement. Amazon can become a good buy if the stock falls 25-30% from its current value. As seen in the scenario analysis before, there are possibilities that investment in Amazon can pay off. But the chances for those are slim. So what are you going to do? Probably Bezos can help you make a decision. Jeff Bezos wrote in a recent letter to shareholders, " Given a ten percent chance of a 100 times payoff, you should take that bet every time. But you're still going to be wrong nine times out of ten. We all know that if you swing for the fences, you're going to strike out a lot, but you're also going to hit some home runsâ€¦This long-tailed distribution of returns is why it's important to be bold. Big winners pay for so many experiments." Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.
