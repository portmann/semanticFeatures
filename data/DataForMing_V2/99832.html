Boeing: No Major News, But Still A Good Paris Air Show For The Jet Maker - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Boeing received 309 orders valued at $45 bn. Orders for the Boeing 747-8F and Boeing 777F show that demand for air cargo is picking up pace again. On the widebody market, Boeing seems to be leading the way, while Airbus is trying to match the seat-mile costs of the Boeing 777X. In my previous articles, I had a look at the orders that were placed during the Paris Air Show, and also had a look at news about Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSF ) ( OTCPK:EADSY ) which is looking to improve its widebody aircraft to match the Boeing (NYSE: BA ) 777X's seat-mile cost. Figure 1: A Boeing 747-8F moments before touch down (Source: ainonline.com ) During the Paris Air Show, Boeing won 331 orders valued at $45.3 bn or $146.9 mln per aircraft. Boeing's higher value per aircraft compared to Airbus is caused by the fact that Boeing has slightly higher list prices and a smaller share of the orders were placed for the cheaper narrowbody aircraft. Considering that Airbus gives a slightly higher discount, Boeing will stay ahead in terms of value per aircraft after discount as well. Boeing received 21 orders for the Boeing 777, 11 of those orders were for the Boeing 777 Classic and 10 of them were for the Boeing 777X. For Boeing, the order for 11 Boeing 777 Classic airframes is a welcome one, since Boeing is looking to fill up all delivery slots and keep producing the Classic until 2025 while simultaneously ramping up production for the Boeing 777X. The 21 ordered airframes are equivalent to almost 3 months of production. Russian carrier Aeroflot canceled its order for 22 Boeing 787-8 aircraft, but it is expected that other airlines will be lining up for the freed delivery slots. Additionally, Boeing received an order for 30 Boeing 787-9 airframes, which should be more profitable than the Boeing 787-8 for the jet maker. Ethiopian Airlines ordered 6 Boeing 787 airframes, which previously were listed as 'unidentified' by Boeing. The order from Ethiopian Airlines is for a few early-built Boeings that were refused by customers due to weight issues. Boeing and Volga-Dnepr Airlines signed a letter of intent for the purchase of 20 Boeing 747-8F. The order intention is a huge support for the 747 program that has a very small order backlog. Additionally, the order intention also shows that demand for air cargo is rising again, which is key for the survival of Boeing 747. During the Paris Air Show, Boeing received 29 order (intentions) for freighters. This shows that cargo airlines see demand for air cargo travel rising again. Until May 2015, Boeing already received 11 orders for its freighters, bringing its total orders for freighters in 2015 to 40. Next to the revival of the air cargo market, Boeing's non-existent MoM aircraft drew some attention as well. Airbus is receiving orders for the Airbus A321 and Airbus A321neo, and Boeing has nothing in that market segment to counter the Airbus A321. Boeing received much needed orders for the Boeing 777 and Boeing 747. Orders for the Boeing 747-8F and Boeing 777F show that demand for air cargo is picking up pace again. Boeing and Airbus tied on widebody orders during the Paris Air Show. Boeing actually received more orders, but Aeroflot canceled an order for the Boeing 787. On the widebody market, Boeing seems to be leading the way, while Airbus is trying to match the seat-mile costs of the Boeing 777X. This Paris Air Show showed that Boeing is positioned well for the future and a middle-of-market aircraft could add to Boeing's strong product line.
