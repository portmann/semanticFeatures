Globalstar: Wireless Industry Presents United Front Against TLPS, Putting Globalstar In Danger - Globalstar, Inc. (NYSEMKT:GSAT) | Seeking Alpha Today's public panel discussion brings together GOOG, MSFT, and more in the fight against TLPS. A wide range of wireless stakeholders now recognizes TLPS as bad technology and bad policy. Today a who's who of important and influential stakeholders in the wireless industry are coming together publicly to voice their opposition to Globalstar's (NYSEMKT: GSAT ) proposed Terrestrial Low Power Service (TLPS) - a concept once touted by Globalstar as the only solution to a dire Wi-Fi spectrum crisis but now increasingly recognized by a broad and growing range of observers as bad technology and bad public policy. Details for the event are available here . Even Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), rivals in businesses like search, have joined forces to highlight TLPS's shortcomings - not just the interference risks it poses to other users of the 2.4GHz band but the ugly precedent it would set in granting a single private party de facto control over public spectrum. Today's event, organized by Microsoft and the non-profit Open Technology Institute and hosted at Microsoft's Innovation & Policy Center in Washington, D.C., will include the following experts: From Microsoft, Michael Daum, technology policy strategist; From the Wireless Internet Service Providers Association - a strong and respected advocate for rural broadband access - Vice President Alex Phillips (a member of the FCC's Consumer Advisory Committee); From the Wi-Fi Alliance, the key Wi-Fi industry group, Russell Fox, counsel; From the National Cable & Telecommunications Association, the leading trade group for cable companies, Paul Caritj, counsel; and From the Open Technology Institute, a non-profit think tank focused on "freedom and justice in the digital age," Michael Calabrese, a member of the U.S. Department of Commerce's Spectrum Management Advisory Committee and former member of the president's spectrum reform working group in 2011-12. Each of these participants has voiced concern about Globalstar's TLPS proposal in FCC filings. Google's filing is available here and Microsoft's here . WISPA's latest filing is here ; the Wi-Fi Alliance's latest filing is here and NCTA's is here . The Open Technology Institute has filed criticism here , here and here . The opposition to TLPS does not fall along conventional partisan or factional lines. While groups like the Open Technology Institute and the cable industry were at loggerheads over net neutrality, they agree on the problems with TLPS. Likewise, the predominantly rural-focused members of WISPA have historically had a strong ally in Ajit Pai, one of the Republican FCC commissioners, while unlicensed interest groups including the Wi-Fi Alliance have often benefited from the support of Jessica Rosenworcel, one of the Democratic commissioners; yet they all see eye to eye on TLPS. Globalstar, by contrast, has no strong allies, in keeping with its failure to offer any meaningful benefit to the public. It simply wants special regulatory treatment in a last-gasp bid to keep its failed business afloat, and the wireless community is increasingly seeing its self-interested spin for what it is. Since making our Globalstar short position public, we have always maintained that the stock is worthless even if the FCC authorizes TLPS. Thus, we did not fear the possibility of a near-term approval. But given how intense the opposition to TLPS has grown - and how stubbornly Globalstar has refused to offer even a hint of a compromise - we now consider a flat rejection of TLPS a very real possibility. Without the benefit of post-approval hype over TLPS, it will be hard to prolong Globalstar's survival much longer. Globalstar supporters once contended that Google, Microsoft, and big cable companies were among the most likely bidders in what they dreamed would be a frenzied private auction of Globalstar's spectrum; now that all three have put TLPS's very existence in serious jeopardy with their strong opposition, that narrative - always, in truth, ridiculous - is shattered beyond repair. While some shareholders console themselves with the fantasy that all this opposition must mean that TLPS is somehow a "threat" to the tech giants and thus very valuable, the reality is that a paid, exclusive Wi-Fi channel would have no effect on anyone's business model unless its deployment got far enough to cause harmful interference. Otherwise, how exactly would an exclusive Wi-Fi channel reduce Google or Microsoft's profits? Indeed, if TLPS were anything like what Globalstar's hype portrays it to be - a massive boost to Wi-Fi capacity and the cure to a devastating "congestion" epidemic - then all of these organizations would be eager to support it. The fact that they are not further discredits Globalstar's case. The efforts of the Wi-Fi Alliance, WISPA, Google, Microsoft, and others have nothing to do with fears of competition - in the case of a nonprofit group like the Open Technology Institute, the very concept is meaningless - and everything to do with the long-term downsides of sacrificing public spectrum to private entities in exchange for nothing of value. We hope that today's event will draw more attention to the true nature of TLPS and further demonstrate how out of touch and isolated Globalstar really is.
