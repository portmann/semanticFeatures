Google: An Express Route To Profits Or A Fool's Errand? - Google Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) | Seeking Alpha Google Express is a simple yet brilliant concept. There are two solid reasons local stores want Google Express to expand. Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) has its hands full these days between self-driving cars, Google Drive, YouTube, Google Maps, Google Photos and more. Google Express seems like an odd fit given everything else the company is involved in. However, the company is planning to roll out Express to "many more (cities) soon." If Google is successful, this business could change the relationship between online and physical retail. Google Express is an online shopping destination that's designed to bring customers their favorite local stores' selection, with same-day or overnight delivery . The service currently is available in around 10 cities, which is comparable to Amazon.com's (NASDAQ: AMZN ) 14-city same-day delivery option for Prime members. The basic premise is simple if you live in an area that Express covers, like San Francisco, you order through the site from the 30 participating stores in the area. You choose the items you want (from the local store's selection), and add them to your cart. You check out using Google Wallet and you then choose your delivery window. Google then gets your items from the store(s) and arranges with a courier service for your delivery. The fee for Express is $95 a year, or $10 a month, whichever you prefer, and there's no commitment. Since you use Google Wallet to check out, you can choose any major credit or debit card as your payment method. You pay the same price as you would in the store, but unfortunately you can't use coupons or store only credit cards, and there is no price matching option. If this sounds eerily similar to Amazon Prime, that's intentional. Of course for Prime members, their $99 per year gets them Prime Music, Video and much more. However, Express gives customers the option of getting same-day delivery on orders of $15 or more while Prime same-day delivery requires orders of $35 or more . There are two sides to the reasons that local stores would choose to sign on with the service. For national chains like Target (NYSE: TGT ), Kohl's (NYSE: KSS ), or Walgreen (NASDAQ: WBA ), this is a way to fend off Amazon Prime and offer a same-day or overnight delivery program. For local stores like Palo Alto Sport Shop & Toy World, the company benefits from a significant online shopping presence that might not be possible on its own. For Target in particular, Express seems like a natural extension of its growing online presence. In the last three months, online sales jumped almost 38% annually . Target's REDcard is held by just over 21% of its customer base, and one benefit is free shipping on any size online order. However, where Target.com falls behind its competition is offering a free speedy shipping option. Many orders have a delivery window of as much as five to seven days. If customers can get the same item from Amazon in two days, this puts Target at a disadvantage. Google Express seems to fill this void nicely. However, Express carries two disadvantages to Target. First, Google Wallet doesn't support the Target REDcard. This means these customers miss out on their 5% REDcard discount. For Target to gain the full benefit of Express, the company needs to find a way to work around this limitation. Second, since Express doesn't allow coupons, customers may miss out on deals they could have received in store or on the Target web site. This could lead to dissatisfaction later if the customer realizes they missed out on a better deal. That being said, local stores want Google to expand Express as quickly as possible. With Google arranging the orders and delivery, the stores stand to benefit from increased sales that might otherwise go to Amazon. Google Express is the company's attempt to ward off Amazon. Amazon has become sort of the de facto search engine for goods. The company is also expanding into services with Amazon Home Services. With "tens of millions" of Prime members, and the company's domestic electronics and general merchandise sales growing at 30% annually last quarter, Amazon is a force to be reckoned with. If customers use Amazon to search for goods and services, Google loses directly. As Amazon takes sales from local retailers, those retailers may be in less of a position to spend money advertising on Google sites. In addition, larger profile advertisers may choose to shift their advertising spend to Amazon because of its increased presence. On the other hand, the more customers that use Google Express, the more information the company gains about what products those customers are purchasing. This detailed purchase information can be used to target advertising more successfully. In theory, this leads to better response rates and more lucrative advertising deals for Google. Considering that Google's paid clicks dropped from 26% annual growth last year to just 13% growth this year , Google knows its search business has weakened. Amazon is pulling product searches away and weakening brick and mortar stores that advertise on Google Sites. The race is on between Amazon and Google to see who can expand same-day or overnight delivery to more cities at a faster rate. If Google can outpace Amazon, the company's search and advertising growth may ramp back up. Google has its hands in a lot of businesses, but Express may be the key to dealing with the Amazon threat.
