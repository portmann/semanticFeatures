Microsoft Is Pulling A Fast One On Google - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft seems to have a plan B for mobile. This plan is necessary because Windows Phone is failing. Microsoft buys e-mail app Acompli, reportedly for $200M+ Do you see what's happening here? I'll tell you what's happening. Microsoft is preparing to pull a fast one on Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ). This is Microsoft readying its "Plan B," for when Windows Phone fails. And as it is, Windows Phone is failing already - it's been losing market share since early 2013 and now stands at just 2.7% of the market, which is basically nothing. Plan B seems to be about taking over Android from Google. That is the "fast one" I am talking about here. Android is seen as open source, and indeed it is open source in the sense that there's an Android Open Source Project (AOSP), and anyone can use this version of Android for free in their smartphones. However, there is an exception to this which is both proprietary (not open) and paid (not free). I am talking about the Google Apps, as well as the licensing to use the Android brand. Google Apps have turned into a significant part of the Android experience, and indeed at times are necessary to provide compatibility to other apps which require their presence to work. These apps include: These apps make the foundation of the Android experience. Many people couldn't even conceive of Android without them. But as it turns out, they're not a central part of the free Android OS though they can be necessary to use it to its fullest. This is where Microsoft might be trying to come in. It's quickly building its own "Microsoft apps" alternative. And indeed, there are already clues that it plans to deploy it that way - as seen in an agreement with Cyanogen . Furthermore, in a way the market is still wide open for this Microsoft strategy. This is so because the Chinese market, which represented 32% of the worldwide smartphone market in 2014, still doesn't receive Google apps. That is, this large market is served by Android, but not by Google. Instead, there's a plethora of different app stores, included apps, etc. Thus, the Chinese market can serve as a beachhead for anyone trying to establish a credible set of alternative apps. And Microsoft seems to be trying exactly for that angle. The one problem this strategy faces is that there are many apps which rely on using Google API calls which are proprietary to Google. Thus, those apps can have a problem working with any alternative. That said, if any alternative captures enough market share, it's certain that those apps will be re-written to work with both large constituencies. There are a few predictions which can be drawn from this thesis: Microsoft will officially bundle these apps, instead of just presenting them separately. And it will try to have more companies install them in their smartphones at inception. However, there is a backlash against bloatware in the West, and having duplicates for every app is unfriendly. As such, I'd expect Microsoft to first make a large push for a China/India installed base with its strategy. Bing Maps will be a thing (APP). Presently, it's included within the Bing app. Nearly every Google app will see a Microsoft equivalent. E-mail, to do, calendar, search, launcher with integrated search, Google Now, etc. This is nearly complete. Lumia Camera, presently on Windows Phone, will see an Android version. There will also be a gallery app, together with Lumia Camera. The one thing which remains to be seen is whether Microsoft will forego licensing fees at this point. In China and India, licensing fees would be a barrier to entry. And even elsewhere, they'd be a problem before Microsoft has a large market share. The priority for Microsoft at this point is to regain a beachhead in mobile, where it failed miserably. Windows Phone has failed, and Windows 10 is unlikely to revive it. I believe that the recent urge by Microsoft to set up a credible suite of mobile Microsoft apps is Microsoft's plan B. This plan includes pulling a fast one on Google, by taking advantage of the open source nature of Android to provide a credible alternative to Google apps. This might be a risk for Google over time. If Microsoft manages to take significant share from Google on Android over time, this will allow it to also reinforce its Bing franchise among others. As for Google, smartphones where Microsoft takes share will be smartphones less prone to do Google searches. It remains to be seen how Google will handle this if Microsoft gets traction for this strategy. The answer might lead to a larger component of Android becoming proprietary over time.
