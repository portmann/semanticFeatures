Time To Accumulate Verizon? - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha Should the tech â€œlosersâ€? of last week be given a second chance? Technology companies continue to rally along with markets this past week: adding nearly $229 billion in total value. As Verizon underperforms the peer group, is it time to buy the stock? Welcome to the tech sector's fifteenth edition of "Buy on Weakness?", a series of articles that sifts through the underperformers of the week to find potential investment opportunities in the large-cap tech world. The table below highlights the top 20 tech companies - worth $10 billion or more in total equity value - that have performed the poorest in the previous five trading days. Source: DM Martins Research, using market data compiled from Zacks As the S&P 500 and Dow pushed to new highs this past week, the tech sector followed suit, returning +3.4% for the week. A mere 9 mega-cap tech stocks were down for the week. Infosys Limited (NYSE: INFY ) missed consensus earnings by $.01 ($.23 cons. vs. $.22 actual) dragging down the stock by a little less than 5% for the week. Other noteworthy downward moves include NTT DoCoMo (NYSE: DCM ) with a -4.1% move and Yahoo Japan ( OTCPK:YAHOY ) with a -3.8% decline. The top 20 tech losers of the week have a median 2017 forward P/E of 17.8x, compared to the S&P 500's median trailing P/E of 14.6x and the overall tech sector's 26.5x. This week's top 20 group is expected to grow EPS in 2017 by only 11.2%, and the companies generate small median dividend yield of .1% (10 of the 20 companies are dividend-payers). The table below highlights, in green font, the three best-positioned tech companies in each of the following categories: projected EPS growth, dividend yield, forward P/E and forward PEG (P/E divided by percentage-point EPS growth). Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) cracked this week's biggest loser list with a positive price performance but a well below-average performance when compared to its other tech peers. Verizon trails this week's list with the highest 2016 forward PEG ratio of 3.7 based on relatively low growth estimates compared to the rest. However, the dividend yield of 4.1% and 2016 forward P/E of 14.4x both look very interesting. There were few surprises when Verizon met analyst expectations in 1Q16. As the company faces fiercer competition, they decided to change their data plans in an effort to combat other providers. - The bull case: SA author Sarah Ji sees the recent change that Verizon made to increase the data plans prices as a key strategy in ensuring long term growth, rather than engaging other competitors in a price war. Verizon could be a key defensive buy given the current economic environment. Even as we have seen the U.S. Equity markets near the all-time highs, the Fed is reluctant to raise rates. Verizon's sticky and reliable dividend and cheap P/E multiple would be an excellent choice in weathering market risk given recent global uncertainty, especially surrounding the recent events in Europe. - The bear case: Even considering that the recent change to the data plans might bode well to Verizon in the short term, as clients pay slightly more for significantly more data, is the move enough to generate uplift in the long run? As SA author Cameron Graham points out , services such as Google's FI should raise flags over Verizon's ability to keep current margins, given the potential growth and new entry of products similar to Project FI.
