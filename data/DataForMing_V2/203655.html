Why Skylake Is A Future Earnings Catalyst For Intel - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Skylake makes a meaningful dent on performance even when compared to overclocked CPUs from prior generations. This creates meaningful incentive for enthusiast gamers to buy Skylake CPUs which will correspondingly add momentum to ASP trends. PC gaming is growing at a pretty rapid pace, so the transition in sales mix could offer long-term revenue growth despite broadening weakness in the PC market. Therefore, Intel's PCCG could have a better than expected quarter. But even in the best case scenario earnings remain flat, which is why I'm hesitant to upgrade the stock. So, for the most part, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) has been able to deliver meaningful performance gains with the recent launch of its Skylake CPU family. There has been concern over whether Intel could in fact generate meaningful growth in the enthusiast segment of the market, which is the largest profit pool aside from laptop and server CPU units. In a recent article from AnandTech, the performance testing indicates that there's a compelling reason for high-end PC users to upgrade their CPUs: A large number of users invested into Intel-based platforms during the Core 2 Quad, Nehalem and Sandy Bridge releases. Sandy Bridge was notable because it inferred a large performance gain at stock speeds, and with a good processor anyone could reach 4.7 GHz and even higher using a good high-end cooler. With that, Intel has had a problem enticing these users to upgrade because their performance has been constantly matched by Ivy Bridge, Haswell and Broadwell - for every 5% IPC increase from the CPU, an average 200 MHz was lost on the good overclock and they would have to find a good overclocking CPU again. There was no great reason, apart from chipset functionality to upgrade. That changes with Skylake. For those who aren't familiar with overclocking, it's basically a method where a PC user can increase the clock speed from the stock speed by increasing the voltage. The performance gains vary based on application but generally speaking gaming performance does improve. However, more empirical studies also point out that the life of the CPU declines considerably, which may result in stability issues further on down the road. However, those issues become more apparent over the course of years, which is why the trade off seems justifiable among enthusiast PC users as they tend to replace their CPUs prior to a noticeable decline in performance. Generally speaking, Sandy Bridge CPUs were the easiest to overclock, which reduced the incentive to upgrade into newer CPUs like Haswell or Broadwell for example. However this is likely to change as AnandTech also mentions: From a clock-to-clock performance perspective, Skylake gives an average ~25% better performance in CPU based benchmarks, and when running both generations of processors at their stock speeds that increase jumps up to 37%. In specific tests, it is even higher. When you scale up to a 4.5 GHz Skylake against a 4.7 GHz Sandy Bridge, the 4% frequency difference is only a tiny portion of that. There are other added benefits, such as the move to a DDR4 memory topology that has denser memory modules, as well as PCIe storage and even PCIe 3.0 graphics connectivity. Furthermore, Intel also integrated various other technologies which becomes much more pertinent when dealing with the transition to DirectX 12, new connectivity standards and graphical performance when dealing with 4K. That being the case, PC shipments are expected to decline at a 1.7% rate over the next five years. If you were to look at the data in isolation it could be interpreted negatively. But, on the other hand, Microsoft mentioned at its analyst briefing that PC gaming revenue grew at a 117% growth rate over the trailing two-year period. This indicates that while mainstream PCs will likely stagnate, the demand for higher end components that can run cutting-edge gaming applications will be relatively strong. This should correspondingly drive Intel's average selling price per CPU unit, which would also have a positive impact on margins as well. Looking at the prior two CPU generations, the improvements in CPU speeds were centered at the lower power envelopes, which resulted in much more meaningful performance gains for laptop and tablet CPUs. While there was a compelling argument to upgrade your laptop the same could not be said about your desktop, especially if you were proficient at overclocking your CPU. That's no longer the case in 2015. In the most recent quarter, desktop platform volumes decreased by 22% between Q2 2014 and Q2 2015. However desktop platform average selling prices increased 6% from Q2 2014 to Q2 2015. Based on IDC figures, desktop PCs are expected to stabilize over the next two years, but average selling prices could potentially offset the negative impact from volumes. Furthermore, notebook CPU units are expected to grow, which also will add some upside to the PCCG segment. Initially, expectations were extremely weak for the PCCG, but going forward, those expectation may rise. Therefore, I'm starting to become more optimistic on Intel despite the recent weakness in price action. In a recent article, I lowered my price target on Intel from $36 to $31. Admittedly I do anticipate Skylake to improve demand for high-end CPU units, but I don't anticipate this segment to carry revenue and earnings. There are still supply issues in the PC channel, which will negatively impact demand in the broader PC market. The good news is perhaps Intel can sustain improvements in ASPs, which will drive revenue and earnings growth in fiscal year 2016. Fiscal year 2015 is likely to remain more of a transitional year as earnings are likely to remain flat in the best case scenario, which reduces any possibility of meaningful stock appreciation.
