Apple: Uniquely Well Positioned For The Future Of TV - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Following decisions by the FCC, the broadcast TV industry is moving rapidly to implement distribution of video content via the Internet. Apple TV is becoming a preferred conduit for this distribution, based on Apple's anti-piracy technology. A next-generation Apple TV will be able to offer apps and games, providing the most important discriminator against other set-top boxes: access to the iOS ecosystem. Following the Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Watch event, I observed that one of the important subtextual messages appeared to be that a new Apple TV was on the way. Based on recent reports, it appears that this new Apple TV will offer a viewing experience much closer to Steve Jobs' vision for television. Most importantly, Apple TV will offer important discriminators that other set-top boxes cannot match. Tim Cook's statement following the unveiling of HBO Now that this was "just the beginning" for Apple TV should probably have received more attention. Reports from the Wall Street Journal and NY Times , indicate that there is certainly much more to come. According to the reports, Apple TV will be able offer a cable-like package of broadcast and cable TV channels, with the exception of those offered by Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) (NASDAQ: CMCSK ), and its subsidiary NBC/Universal. This follows the announcements by DISH Network (NASDAQ: DISH ) of Sling TV, as well as announcements of similar services by Sony (NYSE: SNE ) and CBS (NYSE: CBS ). Big Media companies such as the owners of Hulu, Comcast, Disney (NYSE: DIS ) and 21st Century Fox (NASDAQ: FOX ), have very effectively limited the distribution of broadcast and cable TV content via the Internet. Now the dam suddenly seems to be bursting. Some have pointed to recent Net Neutrality rules proposed by the FCC as the reason. Actually, the Net Neutrality rules were probably not as important a factor as the recent blog post by FCC Chairman Wheeler, which I wrote about in Apple's New Television Opportunity . In the blog, Wheeler proposed a very simple rules change not really related to Net Neutrality. In the proposal, the rules regarding Multi-channel Video Programming Distributors (MVPDs) would be made "technology neutral." Cable and satellite video distributors are classified as MVPDs. Making the MVPD classification "technology neutral" sounds like such an innocuous little change, but it has huge consequences. Under current FCC rules, content providers such as the TV and cable "networks" cannot withhold content from any MVPD that wishes to distribute that content, as long as the MVPD pays the appropriate licensing and distribution fees to the content provider. It's a "level playing field" requirement that is typically mandated by the FCC's legal charter. In proposing the rules change, Wheeler specifically had in mind distribution via the Internet rather than cable or satellite. The simple, innocuous rules change that Wheeler proposed would make it impossible for content providers to block Internet-based distribution of their content. With the Wheeler blog, the handwriting was clearly on the wall for Big Media and prospective Internet-based MVPDs that the FCC wasn't going to allow Big Media to fight the future any longer. As I pointed out in " The End of TV As We Know It ," the future of digital content delivery, any digital content, including books, TV shows, movies and music, was clearly the Internet. Furthermore, the radio spectrum that the TV broadcasters had licensed for decades had simply become too valuable for mobile communications. The pressure on the broadcasters to vacate their spectrum allocations will only continue to intensify. What we're beginning to see in the industry is a scramble to adjust to the new Internet-based content distribution paradigm. I felt that Apple would be well positioned to benefit from this paradigm shift, by virtue of its well developed iTunes software. iTunes is relatively platform agnostic, and is supported by infrastructure Apple has built including massive server farms and its reported Internet content delivery network . Most importantly for the content providers, iTunes, in all its various manifestations (Windows and Mac PCs, iPhone, iPad, Apple TV) has proven anti-piracy capability that content providers would insist on for any digital content distribution approach. But won't Apple face competition from anyone else who wants to become an Internet-based MVPD? Eventually, yes, but that may take more time than you might think, as would-be MVPDs certify their equipment and software for security against digital piracy. Apple's lead time may only be months, but those will be valuable months. But the most important discriminator that Apple will be able to offer for iTunes Live will be its close coupling with the Apple Mac and iOS ecosystems. The software that displays a cable or TV channel will also be able to display useful background information about the show and its cast, as well as enable sharing via social media. The greater level of interactivity that distribution via the Internet provides may be only the beginning of a merger of what has until now been divergent phenomena, on-line gaming and traditional TV. As traditional TV content providers become more adept at the new medium of Internet distribution, more will adopt some form of game-type involvement for their audience. I see a lot of creative potential yet to be unlocked in this new Internet TV paradigm. Apple TV in its current form hardly seems like an iOS device, even though it is fundamentally. To fully exploit Apple's ecosystem discriminators, as well as take advantage of the interactivity potential inherent in Internet distributed TV content, Apple TV will need to become much more capable from an app standpoint. This is something I've been predicting for the next generation Apple TV for a while now. For the most part, that new app capability will be focused on games and entertainment. For this, the next-gen Apple TV will need enhanced hardware, as well as a wireless game controller. I take these as a given for the next-gen Apple TV, and there could also be more innovation in the wireless remote that will allow Apple TV to run general purpose iOS apps. What's the killer app for next-gen Apple TV, besides games and video? Home automation. Apple's HomeKit home automation APIs provide the means of controlling compatible devices from any iOS device. The devices can include security sensors and cameras, lights, thermostats, smoke alarms, garage doors, locks, etc. As cool as it is to be able to turn on your lights or peek through an IP cam via the Internet from anywhere in the world, when you're away from home, you really want something monitoring all your HomeKit appliances and making sure that they work as intended. A next-gen Apple TV running a suitable HomeKit app would be ideal for this. It would require only a few watts (with your TV off), and be able to run continuously while you're gone. Cook reported that Apple had sold 25 million Apple TVs at the Watch event, but that's over the life of the product and doesn't really amount to much more than a "hobby" for Apple. What would it take to "move the needle"? Probably 10 million units a quarter, but that's probably not going to happen. I think that a next-gen Apple TV with the characteristics I've described could reach console level sales of about 5 million a quarter. With significantly greater capability than the current Apple TV, Next Gen would probably be priced at $150-200 per unit, more with add-ons such as game controllers. So Next Gen Apple TV could be worth an extra $1 billion per quarter in revenue. Not much by Apple standards, but still an important piece of the Apple ecosystem that increases Apple's importance in the home.
