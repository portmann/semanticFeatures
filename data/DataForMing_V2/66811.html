Why Alibaba Should Buy Yahoo, Right Now - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha IRS speculation created more downside in YHOO last week. There is now a bigger disconnect between YHOO and BABA. Speculation of Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) buying Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) has died down since the former unveiled its SpinCo plans. However, potential IRS drama last week once more intensified these rumors , and in looking at the state of both companies, Yahoo might be the wisest, most lucrative acquisition that Alibaba has made yet. As of right now, Yahoo's 15% stake of Alibaba is worth almost $35 billion. The conventional thought is that once Yahoo spins off its stake, Alibaba will then one day buy it back. If not, there would essentially be two publicly-traded forms of Alibaba with a very similar number of shares available to the market. But here's the thing, if you subtract Yahoo's Alibaba stake and its cash & equivalents, the remaining value of Yahoo's core business is zero dollars. That means that Yahoo's 35.5% stake of Yahoo Japan, valued at $9 billion, is a bonus, and its $4.7 billion a year core business is on the house. Where else has there ever been an investment opportunity like that? Over the last year, Alibaba has made as many acquisitions as any large company, and Yahoo's presence in advertising, content publishing, soon-to-be video, mobile apps, and the Web in general fits into Alibaba's apparent investment/acquisition strategy . Furthermore, Alibaba's big investment in Zulily (NASDAQ: ZU ) not too long ago is proof that it's not afraid to invest in companies that are considered laggards in industries that Alibaba management believes has promise. As a result, the question may not be whether Yahoo would be a good acquisition for Alibaba, but whether Yahoo has the incentive to sell itself to Alibaba. A couple weeks ago Yahoo ranked in the top five of my Tipping The Scale numeric research service of stocks with the most upside potential. Due to the valuation-related reasons listed herein, including the essential zero dollar worth of Yahoo core and Yahoo Japan, I believe that upside still exists, as explained in Tipping The Scale . Therefore, why would Yahoo have any incentive to sell itself to Alibaba? The answer lies in whether Yahoo considers the IRS a risk. Last week shares of Yahoo fell behind fears that the IRS may prevent its spinoff of Alibaba stock. Yahoo has responded that any potential IRS changes are not directed at Yahoo, and that it plans to move forward with the divestment. However, investors never know the conversations that are taking place internally within a company, and whether or not Meyer & company fear government backlash. If so, Yahoo's board likely realizes that such a dilemma could cause short-term pressure on the stock, thereby incentivizing management to sell the company while its stock price is high. Nevertheless, it doesn't matter if Yahoo spins off Alibaba in December or in three years. The fact of the matter is that it still owns a 15% stake, and so long as Alibaba's stock appreciates, as does the value of that 15% stake. In other words, any further disconnect between Yahoo and Alibaba's stock just adds to the long-term upside in Yahoo shares, and makes the company that much more attractive to Alibaba. The bottom line is that all the dominos are finally aligned to where if Alibaba is going to make a move for Yahoo, and Yahoo accept, that time is now.
