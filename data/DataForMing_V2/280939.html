Can Intel Start Growing Again? - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. Intel continues to fail to gain traction in high growth markets. Intel's server dominance appears unassailable in the near future, and the market should continue to grow. The PC market will get more challenging for Intel, with no catalyst for market growth, and emerging competition from AMD. 2015 was yet another year where Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) was unable to show growth, with success in some areas offset by deficiencies in others. Although Intel continued to dominate important markets, those markets regressed. I have been ambivalent about Intel for quite some time, as past articles indicate , and the stock price has remained pretty steady during that time. The company is so large, it's easy to find success and failure in different segments, and those segments have remained largely the same for the past few years. Having listened to Intel's technology conference , I was very disappointed in the leadership, and the lack of candor and realism in the remarks given by it. The company even went so far as to say Skylake was the largest processor jump in the company's history. In fact, it's a relatively minor upgrade, and does not even approximate the generational jumps in processors up to the Pentium Pro release in 1995. This was just one of many comments that put me off. I remain very pessimistic about management, which I hope is understandable given the inability over the past decade to effectively benefit from new growth markets. As we look at the Q3 revenue, we see not only a year-to-year drop on a quarterly basis, but also a drop for the first nine months of the year. With the cost of sales up, gross margins naturally fell. The Client Computing group was largely responsible for this decline, but the larger problem is that the Internet of Things group did not grow, and this was considered a vital growth area. The reality is, this market is just not there yet, and without standardization, it is not clear when or if this market will grow, and who the winners will be if/when it does. I do believe Intel has good products in this market, as I have covered in past articles, but this does not guarantee success. I was expecting better from this group. The Data Center group grew, but only about 10%, which is significantly lower than Intel had projected. With the client markets, including smartphones, doing significantly worse than expected, I do not view this unfavorably. All things considered, it's doing quite well, and it should also benefit from the new products based on the 14nm process more than the PC market, so believe this could become even stronger for the company. Naturally, competition will be ramping, but its very difficult to see anything meaningful in 2016. If we look at the biggest threats to Intel's dominance in servers, it comes from ARM (NASDAQ: ARMH )-based solutions, IBM's (NYSE: IBM ) POWER and OpenPOWER, and AMD's (NASDAQ: AMD ) upcoming x86 solutions. One only needs to look at AMD's de-emphasis of the ARM-based K12, as well as the "Seattle" platform to get a clear indication of where ARM is, with regards to servers. ARM may one day represent a real threat to x86 in this market, but that day is not today, and not tomorrow. Given how long it takes to develop both hardware and software platforms, as well the very slow pace of adopting new platforms by server customers, ARM will not have serious market share this decade. Anything else is wishful thinking, and unrealistic. IBM represents a more real threat, but even here, this platform is not ready. There is no question IBM makes extremely powerful and capable machines, exceeding even those made by Intel, but these carry a price tag which largely prevent them from gaining significant market share. OpenPOWER does attempt to address this, and has the backing of very capable companies, but it is still developing products, and is currently severely limited in scope compared to the x86 market. It is certainly further ahead than ARM. With IBM's unquestionable expertise in this type of technology, in both hardware and software, it could represent a threat before the turn of this decade. However, considering where it is now, and how long it takes to adopt new technology in servers, it's very difficult to see this taking significant market share from x86 in the next year or two. Which leaves AMD, and the Zen architecture. AMD does know how to make server parts, excellent GPUs, and very good low-end processors. It's not as clear the company knows how to make a competitive high-end processor, and has not in quite some time. Although AMD has gained some overall PC market share in Q3, and in commercial products, it's important to note that both were quite minor, and both markets are much more price sensitive than the server market. This has left AMD with .5% of the server market, as price reductions are generally ineffective and there is little AMD can do to materially increase market share with the current product offerings. We should also note that Zen will initially be targeting the PC market, and only later the server market. Again, we have to consider the slow pace of adoption, even considering Zen will use the same instruction set as Intel products, and there's very little chance of AMD gaining significant market share in 2016 or 2017. Whether it can later on will depend largely on how well it can compete with Intel server chips, and it's far from obvious that it will show competitive characteristics. I'll reiterate, pricing will not remedy a technological deficiency in server parts like it can in the PC market. So, I do not see the Data Center Group having any real competition near term, and believe it will continue to be a driver of growth. The market itself should continue to grow. Although data consumption may not be growing as fast as it was, it is still growing. Furthermore, the move to 14nm will give newer processors favorable power characteristics vis-a-vis older ones, which could stimulate replacement cycles. When we look at the Client Computing Group, we see a different situation. This group includes the PC market, tablet market, and the phone market, which makes seeing specific numbers for each quite difficult. No doubt this is intentional, as Intel management likes to cover up problem areas with inappropriate groupings like this. After all, what do low-cost phones and the PC market have to do with each other? If you answer they share, in some cases, the same architecture, one only needs to look at the Data Center Group to see that this applies even more with respect to the PC market. Although the Silvermont/Airmont architecture could never be confused with an excellent one, Intel's wide breadth of supporting technologies still give it a good chance in the low end phone market as the SoFIA platform gains momentum. Another bright spot is, the tablet market has collapsed, and with it the massive losses associated with Intel's contra-revenue program, which I had derided in previous articles. Management failed badly here, and lost over $10 billion pursuing a market that soon fell into a massive decline. It is not hindsight to say management should have seen this, as many of us saw this incredibly obtuse program as poorly conceived long ago. Luckily, this appears to be less and less of a strain on the company, although the real problem has not been addressed; management. The type of management that actually thought this was a good idea, but thought selling processors to Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) for the initial iPhone was a bad one. One they could not make money on. There are other problems though, that will only get worse. Apple's A9X has become so powerful , the days of Apple using Intel chips in Macs is likely coming to an end. This processor has at least the same IPC as Intel's high-end mobile parts. As such it easily beats the Core M, and is quite close to higher clocked i5 processors in performance. There are big cost savings for Apple to using their own processors, especially when they all use the same instruction set. They also have much more control over the final product. Although the A9X is still not quite as powerful enough to replace x86 in the high-end, the enormous strides it has made show the time is nearing when it will be. It is also important to note that these will almost certainly be made at TSMC (NYSE: TSM ) or Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ), and not at Intel's plants, further fueling the success of these competitors to Intel. Apple's successful processor designs not only portend an eventual move of the Mac to ARM, but also limits the market for Intel's processors in the tablet and phone market. Intel has already accepted that its phone products would be low-end, so it is not a big deal there. But, it does put more pressure on the tablet market for Intel, which in any case is already not in great shape. The PC market will also get worse with AMD's move to Zen. We do not know how much better it will be than AMD's current products, but it is safe to say it will greatly close the gap that currently exists. I say this because it finally moves AMD's processors to FinFETs, and by all indications has substantial per core improvements (40%) over Excavator. It is very possible Intel will continue to have an overall advantage, but if they are close, this will put much more pricing pressure on Intel. With Intel's delay of a 10nm part, Kaby Lake, which is likely the same architecture as Skylake given the timing, will be Intel's product that will compete with Zen. It is conceivable AMD could have a product at least somewhat close to Kaby Lake, although we should reserve judgment until we have more substantial information. "Storage Class Memory" has been getting a lot of attention lately. Although Intel initially exaggerated the characteristics of 3D XPoint, it is still a very compelling technology. However, despite the nonsense Intel was trying to advance, it does not in any way approximate the speed of DRAM, and any uses in that capacity would bring with it a severe performance penalty, unless the unit it was attached to was equally low performance. However, it is significantly faster than EEPROMs (or Flash), and should be cheaper to make than DRAM, so will occupy a very important area between DRAM and Flash, the latter of which is roughly 1000 times slower latency than the former. There are three types of memory technologies vying for this space: phase-change, resistive memory, and spin-transfer RAM. Intel and its partner Micron have chosen phase-change for 3D Xpoint. It's not clear which of these will ultimately succeed, it is clear the market for a memory with the persistence of Flash, but with speeds closer to DRAM, will continue to grow. All in all, Intel remains mixed. On the plus side, the server group seems very safe, and almost certain to keep growing. The low-end phone market should also grow for Intel as SoFIA matures. IoT is less clear, as it has not shown growth, and the market has still not matured. The jury is still out on 3D Xpoint, although I do feel mildly optimistic towards it. The PC market will be a challenge, and likely continue to get worse in the foreseeable future. How this all adds up is unclear, but my guess would be mild growth in 2016. I do believe the server market will see a more significant uptick than the PC market will see a down tick. In reality, server growth seems nearly certain, a continued erosion of PC revenue much less so. I also believe Intel will gain traction with SoFIA, albeit it might be muted initially, gaining momentum in the latter half of 2016 and into 2017. I also think 3D Xpoint will be a compelling technology in server scenarios, but probably may also require time before it becomes a significant part of Intel's revenue. None of this will make Intel a high growth company, but any growth after so many years of stagnation has to be considered favorably. Factor in the very attractive dividend, and Intel's relentless stock repurchasing programs, and there could still be value in this as an investment stock, especially at these relatively low prices.
