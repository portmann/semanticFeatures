Buy Ford And Enjoy The Ride - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha When it comes to car stocks, Ford (NYSE: F ) is an option to consider. Ford is a worldwide company that designs, manufactures, markets, and finances cars, trucks, SUV's, and electrified vehicles. Their vehicles are sold under Ford and Lincoln for their luxury vehicles. To facilitate the sale of their vehicles, they provide financing alternatives thru Ford Credit. As a summary, Ford sells cars that are well known in the industry. Even though Ford has been in business since early 1900's, the company's common stock has been trending sideways for the last five years while the market has trended upward. Though the last 5 years might suggest Ford will continue trending sideways for the next 5 years, research is warranted to see if Ford is an undervalued company waiting to be discovered and priced accordingly. Looking at Ford's stats, their P/E, P/S, net income, sales growth, net margin, ROA, and ROA are superior to the industry's. Interestingly the metrics that are not superior to the industry are related to the risk they posses in comparison to the industry. On the other side, the metrics that are more attractive than the industry's are related to 2 important areas of investing, growth and performance (i.e. ROE). Click to enlargeFrom a technical perspective, Ford's share price is over the 50 day simple moving average but not over the 200 day moving average. Though this is not a bullish indicator, it can be seen that the stock crossed the 50 day SMA recently. On top of that, Ford announced on 03/01/2016 record sales for the month of February. This announcement with the stock price starting a bullish pattern give credibility to the start of a run in the stock. As mentioned initially, Ford's performance over the last 5 years has not been appealing. Not only have they performed worse than the S&P 500 they also have under performed relative to the industry. Since 2006 most metrics and statistics have turned favorable for Ford. On the graphs below, net margin, return on equity and on invested capital, leverage, operating margin, free cash flow, free cash flow growth, and revenue growth have improved demonstrating a better run company that is more profitable, stable, and efficient. It can be seen that Ford being in a cyclical industry is volatile in their growth, earnings, and capital structure. In the long term, Ford has improved most metrics. Even better, the variance that is seen year after year gets smaller every year demonstrating focused, prudent, and top notch management. For those not with a background in finance, it can be said that Ford's products are great in general and that they have gotten better over the years. When you add to this a stable dividend paying company that has operated for over 100 years in a well known industry, Ford stock is an option to consider. Like any investment, Ford does present risks. The company is highly leveraged (in my opinion), it's in a cyclical industry, faces fierce competition, and is subject to industry shifts including EV's, self driving vehicles, and consumer inclination to not owning cars (i.e. Uber). Acknowledging those factors outstanding, Ford's valuation is cheap, the company has become much more efficient, their products are of high quality, and the dividend yield of 4.6% is decent and sustainable. This makes Ford a buy and its stock price should run up within a short time frame. Source: All images and information was obtained from Morningstar and Ford's Investor site.
