Ford Motor: I Am Reducing My Price Target To $14 - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I am/we are long F. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. Ford Motor's stock is down ~17% year-to-date. Ford Motor released excellent fourth quarter results yesterday, beating the consensus earnings estimate, too. Investors, however, would have none of it, and used the earnings release as an excuse to sell the stock. I am reducing my price target on Ford's stock in light of the recent market turbulence and negative investor sentiment. After Ford Motor (NYSE: F ) closed 2015 on a strong note in terms of sales in China, Europe and the United States, it was to be expected that the auto maker's fourth quarter results would also be nothing short of great. Ford's U.S. sales climbed 5% in 2015 and Ford's European new vehicle sales surged 11%, outpacing industry growth of 9%. Since Ford Motor saw exceptionally strong sales in the U.S. and China in December, too, Ford was on track to report record results for 2015. Ford's management could indeed present fourth quarter and full-year results with its head held high, even though the market does not view the auto maker very favorably right now. Ford Motor said it had $2.6 billion in pre-tax profits in Q4-15, which was an improvement of ~$1.3 billion over last year. North America continues to do extremely well for the auto maker with Q4-15 pre-tax profits of $2.0 billion. Ford's full-year 2015 pre-tax profits reached $10.8 billion, which was $3.5 billion better than a year ago. North America again contributed the lion share of Ford's earnings in 2015: ~87% of total pre-tax profits came from this geography. Ford Motor exceeded most of its 2014 full-year results last year: Automotive revenues, operating margins, cash flow, and profits were well ahead of 2014, and in some cases significantly so. Ford Motor continues to see positive tailwinds in 2016. Ford CEO Mark Fields already guided in early January for a strong 2016 on expectations that the auto maker will be able to sustain sales and margin growth. Nonetheless I am reducing my price target on the stock The 2016 outlook looks robust, but investors are still not buying Ford. That's the simple truth. The reason why I am reducing my 12-month price target has therefore nothing to do with Ford's operating results or outlook, but rather with the uphill battle the company will have to fight to overcome negative investor sentiment this year. Ford's stock is down ~17% year-to-date and even the upbeat guidance for 2016 did nothing in terms of improving investor sentiment. Yesterday, when Ford released excellent fourth quarter results that beat the consensus earnings estimate, the stock actually traded down to $11.20, and closed the day 1.18% lower at $11.71. There is no love for Ford Motor in this market, and a lot of it appears to have to do with expectations that the auto maker is approaching a sales and earnings peak before global auto markets are cooling off. I discussed some of the issues keeping Ford Motor's stock down here . Since investors continue to use any opportunity to sell Ford Motor even when results beat expectations, I am reducing my 12-month price target from $17 to $14. The top reason to invest in Ford Motor remains the dividend. Thanks to the sell-off on Thursday, Ford Motor now sells for a ~7.3% dividend yield that takes into account the special dividend of $0.25/share which will be paid in the first quarter. That said, though, I think the upside for Ford's stock unfortunately is very limited in 2016 since investors price a sales and earnings peak into Ford's shares at this point in time. My 12-month price target sits at $14, implying ~20% upside.
