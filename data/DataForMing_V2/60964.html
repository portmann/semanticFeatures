NEW YORK A U.S. appeals court on Monday reversed part of the $930 million verdict that Apple Inc (AAPL.O) won in 2012 against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS), saying the iPhone maker's trade dress could not be protected. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld the patent infringement violations found by the jury. But the $382  million awarded for trade dress dilution will have to be reconsidered by the lower court. Trade dress is a legal term for  a trademark on the way a product is packaged or presented.
