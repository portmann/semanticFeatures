Boeing: The Good, The Bad And The Ugly... - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha On the 27th of April, Boeing (NYSE: BA ) has reported Q1 2016 earnings, and although my estimates were lower than the analysts' estimates, Boeing still managed to somewhat disappoint. Table 1: Comparison estimated revenue and reported revenue Table 1 shows how the reported revenues differed from my expectations. The Commercial Airplanes department reported lower-than-expected revenue, resulting in a 5% YoY decline. The Boeing Defense & Space unit exceeded my expectations. Where I expected an average revenue of $6.64 billion with a high estimate of $6.8 billion, Boeing reported revenues that are 20% higher. Higher revenue was primarily driven by the Military Aircraft unit (+34% YoY) and Global Services & Support (+14% YoY). Boeing Capital revenue was $300 million, whereas I expected it to be 0. Boeing's revenue can be seen as a positive surprise, primarily carried by strong Defense & Space revenues. Year-over-year revenue grew 2%, whereas a 3% decline was expected. With revenues coming in higher than expected, Boeing's reported earnings per share can be seen as slightly disappointing. I expected core operating margins of 8%, while Boeing reported 7.5%. This 0.5% difference is caused by the lower efficiency of the Commercial Airplanes department, which reported an operating margin of 7.2% - nowhere close to the 10% that I assumed. The lower margins are caused by charges on the tanker program and the Boeing 747 program. This was somewhat compensated for by operating margin for BDS, which I estimated a few percentage points too high. Last year, Boeing disappointed with its Q1 cash control performance, generating an OCF of $88 million. This year, Boeing reported a solid $1.2 billion in operating cash flow and $483 million in free cash flow, up almost $1 billion year over year. Performance of the Commercial Airplanes unit was disappointing in terms of revenue as well as operating margin. This, however, was partly offset by strong revenue in the BDS segment.
