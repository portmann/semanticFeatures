Futures rise on strong Apple results; Fed awaited | Reuters Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., July 26, 2016. U.S. stock index futures were higher on Wednesday, helped by Apple's stellar results, and ahead of the Federal Reserve's comments on interest rates. * Apple (AAPL.O) shares soared more than 6 percent to $102.66 in premarket trading after the company sold more iPhones than expected in the third-quarter and gave an upbeat current-quarter forecast. * Investors are also waiting to hear what the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has to say about raising interest rates and the health of the U.S. economy. * The FOMC has little room to raise rates this time, but a recent set of strong economic data can strengthen the case for an increase earlier than the market anticipates. * The committee will end its two-day meeting with a statement at 2:00 p.m. ET (1800 GMT). * Traders have priced in a 19.5 percent chance of a rate increase in September and a 42.8 percent chance in December, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool. * Global stocks got a boost after Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe unveiled a $265 billion stimulus package to reflate the country's economy. * Of the 157 S&P 500 companies that have reported results so far, 69 percent have topped earnings estimates.
