Market Rallies Despite Doha; Netflix And IBM Disappoint - Bezek's Daily Briefing | Seeking Alpha The Dow pushed past 18,000 for the first time since last summer. Having fended off the oil threat, the market now has to deal with earnings. Netflix and IBM both traded poorly after-hours Monday, showing that it isn't all roses for this earnings season. Monday was a surprising day. Sunday night, it appeared that markets were going to start the week off with a dive. Futures were down, and oil was off as much as 7%. But Monday rolled around and the negativity gave way to a change in opinion. After opening lower, stocks moved to flat within the first hour. By the end of the session, the Dow (NYSEARCA: DIA ) had squeezed out a triple-digit gain to close just above the 18,000 mark. The bull market may be a bit rusty, but don't count this train out just yet: The S&P 500 (NYSEARCA: SPY ) put in a similarly strong 14-point gain to close just shy of 2,100. It last closed above that mark in December. We're getting back to near record territory. The S&P 500's all-time high of 2,134 sits just 2% away. The Dow sits 350 points - also 2% - from its all-time high. Given the power in Monday's reversal, it's natural to ask whether markets will power up to new highs later this month. That oil news should have given bears some juice, but it simply wasn't happening. The earthquake in Japan appeared likely to cause Yen (NYSEARCA: FXY ) strength that would weaken the carry trade and hurt stocks. The Aussie Dollar (NYSEARCA: FXA ) sold off Sunday, in part due to this. But it didn't stick either. The Brazilian political drama led to a 3% sell-off in Brazilian shares (NYSEARCA: EWZ ) as speculators took the good news as a selling opportunity. That too didn't faze the broader market. More and more signs are pointing to new highs. In retrospect, I wish I had stuck to my "we go directly to new highs call" I offered at 1,850. But over the past month, a confluence of bearish factors had me doubting whether the rally had enough force to make it to the promised land. Regardless, price action rules the day and the bulls are in charge. There's just one thing left with a good chance of stopping the market short of new highs, and that's earnings. Though we're still early in earnings season, so far, things haven't been as bad as expected. Consensus estimates have been for a really bad set of numbers. So while results have been fairly poor, the rate of beats has been high enough to avoid market trouble. If you set the bar low enough, you'll still get plenty of companies that clear it. That said, things could change quickly on the earnings front. This week, almost 20% of the S&P 500 reports. We'll have a good sense of where earnings are by Friday. And if Monday's new information is any guide, things might not be so great. IBM (NYSE: IBM ) got hit for about a 5% decline in the after-hours session Monday. This despite a large headline EPS beat for Big Blue. Apparently the positive number was driven by a large tax credit and shouldn't be viewed as representative. Under the surface, the numbers were less encouraging. Revenues did beat expectations, but this was a weak number. Revenues were still down 5% despite topping consensus. Without currency effects, revenues would have shown a 2% decline, so the blame for this isn't mostly on the strong US Dollar (NYSEARCA: UUP ). IBM's strategic reporting line (which houses the cloud segment) was up double-digits, while most other segments declined. This, as you might expect, led to a big drop in overall operating margins. Still, it's clear things aren't going in the right direction for the firm, and it's an early warning for the broader tech sector. Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) shares got pounded in the after-hours session, falling about 10% to move back below 100. This will leave a mark: If the stock stays down here today, it will make for six weeks of gains being wiped out in a day. In the broader picture, that 130 level is starting to look like a formative top. For those that argue Netflix is wildly overvalued, a move under $80 in coming weeks would certainly support their argument that the stock is in for a good drubbing. In any case, Netflix moved down with ample reason. Subscriber numbers were quite disappointing. Numbers were below what people were hoping for, though they appeared to beat the official consensus estimate. And subscriber guidance was very soft compared to expectations for the current quarter. The international rollout does appear to have a few issues. This is to be expected, as there are many logistical challenges related to pricing, non-English content and local competition that don't arise in the company's home market. You probably don't come to the Briefing for an in-depth discussion of Netflix' business prospects, so I'll stick to the main point. What's coming up for Netflix stock? Well, one quarter doesn't make a trend by itself. Unless you pull a LinkedIn (NYSE: LNKD ) and drop an atomic stinker of a quarter, the market will usually forgive a growth company one disappointment. But future reruns of this will rapidly take the luster off the company's shares. US subscriber growth has slowed and doesn't have enough momentum to justify the company's earnings multiple. The international expansion needs to work in a big way. Trading at 7x sales, several hundred times earnings, and 16x EV/EBITDA, it would take a large drop in the stock price for this to make sense on a normal valuation pattern. The market is pricing Netflix as though international expansion will be a massive success, and this quarter is a warning sign that all may not be well. From my vantage point, it's too early to declare "peak Netflix," but if I were long with gains, I'd be cautious and have a stop loss ready. I wouldn't hold Netflix as a long-term investment. The risk/reward isn't right. Upside isn't that great, and downside is large. And the odds of the downside scenario playing out appear to be above even money. That said, the market tends to be forgiving of this sort of thing; if you're speculating, the stock is still okay to own if the company shows stronger international growth next quarter.
