3 Ways Amazon's Dash Could Make Profits A Prime Problem - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Who would have thought that a wand could wave away Amazon's potential profits? The Dash button seems like a great innovation for Amazon, but it has unintended consequences. If you haven't heard of Amazon.com's (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Dash products, you soon will. The company is constantly innovating and trying to make it easier for customers to order more from the site. The original Dash is essentially like a magic wand for groceries, and the Dash button is an on the spot re-ordering system. If these sound like sure fire hits, they likely will be. However, there are 3 reasons to believe that Amazon may have just made its path to profitability even more difficult. Amazon's Dash has the potential to unhinge the traditional grocery model. Dash is only available on a limited basis, and the customer must be subscribed to AmazonFresh. Dash is a small device that can create a customer's grocery list by them either scanning the bar code of a product, or by voice search. The customer then can edit this list on AmazonFresh before they place their order. Clearly this is not good news for a companies like Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) or Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST ). Wal-Mart gets more than half of its sales from groceries at its namesake chain, and Sam's Club is tied heavily to grocery sales as well. A big part of Costco's business is groceries too. Given that Wal-Mart's overall sales growth was less than 3% annually last quarter, and Costco witnessed net sales growth of just 1% , these companies don't need any more headwinds to their topline growth. Dash sounds great, but there is one big problem, Dash may be too expensive to make sense. Dash itself doesn't cost anything, but in order to use Dash, the customer must subscribe to AmazonFresh which costs $299 per year . By comparison, Costco membership costs about $55 a year and Sam's Club membership costs about $45 per year . AmazonFresh is 440% more than Costco, and 560% more than Sam's Club. Ultimately, customers will have to choose how valuable this service is to them. In addition, Dash could lead to smaller more frequent orders from AmazonFresh. These types of orders would mean increased shipping and fulfillment costs for Amazon. Considering shipping costs have been a significant drag on Amazon's profitability, possible faster growth in this line item is not good news for investors. The second piece of Amazon's Dash product lineup is the Dash button. If a customer uses Tide, they can hang a Tide Dash button on their washer. When they realize they are running low on detergent, they can just press the button and it will instantly reorder their pre-selected Tide option. They set up the size and quantity of their order, and each time they press the Dash button their order gets filled. There are two huge problems with this idea. First, this button eliminates a way that Amazon has been growing its sales in the past. Dash orders exactly what the customer wants and nothing more. Part of Amazon's growth has come from a customer looking on the site to order one thing, and then finding other items to order at the same time. The Dash button eliminates this additional browsing and could limit Amazon's sales growth. Part of the reason Wal-Mart or Costco build stores of the size that they do is so customers will be forced to browse other items before they get to what they want to buy. This browsing can lead to the purchase of higher margin items. Higher margin ancillary purchases are part of why Walmart's operating margin is 5% and Costco's margin is 3.1%. Unfortunately, Amazon's operating margin is just over 1% , and a big reason is the company's shipping and fulfillment expenses have been growing faster than sales. The way the Dash button is designed, means Amazon is almost certainly going to get a lot of smaller orders instead of the larger more profitable orders the company should be courting. The third issue with Amazon's future profitability is the company's real bottom line isn't improving as some investors might believe. Just for point of comparison, in their most recently quarters, Costco generated $357 million in core free cash flow (net income + depreciation - capex), and Wal-Mart produced over $3 billion in cash flow. During this same timeframe, Amazon generates about $500 million in core free cash flow. However, there is more to Amazon's cash flow story. The company uses significant capital leases to acquire equipment. These are real cash expenses but aren't reported the same as traditional capex. Including these capital leases, Amazon's most recent quarter showed roughly $1.2 billion in negative free cash flow. What's even more troublesome is this number represented a 50% increase over last year. Between Dash only being available for AmazonFresh users at $299 a year, the Dash button placing smaller orders, and significant capital leases that may be overlooked, Amazon has some challenges that make profits a prime problem.
