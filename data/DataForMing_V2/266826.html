Boeing: 20% Dividend Increase Rewards Investors As Core Strategy Takes Flight - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Boeing recently raised its dividend by 20% and approved a new $14 billion share repurchase program. These cash returns are possible because of Boeing's strong revenue and earnings growth this year, due to the company's strategic focus on commercial markets. Aerospace giant Boeing (NYSE: BA ) has had a great run this year. The stock is up 13% year to date, not including dividends, while the S&P 500 Index is down 1% in the same time. This performance has come in a tough environment for the industrials companies, as the strong U.S. dollar and slowing economic growth in the emerging markets pose considerable risks. Even better, Boeing management recently unveiled a huge addition to the company's capital return program. Boeing announced a massive 20% dividend hike, as well as a new $14 billion stock buyback program. The $14 billion buyback replaces the existing $12 billion program, which had $5.25 billion left. The dividend raise and upped buyback represent significant amounts of cash being returned to shareholders. This is possible because of Boeing's fundamental success, made possibly by the company's strategic focus. Boeing management deserves credit for seeing the changing landscape in the aerospace and defense industry, and positioning the company to succeed in a new environment. A few years back, Boeing made the decision to concentrate heavily on aerospace, particularly in the commercial market, while many of its rivals targeted the defense industry. For example, Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT ) and General Dynamics (NYSE: GD ) generate 79% and 75% of their respective revenue from defense budgets and government defense spending. Meanwhile, Boeing derives two-thirds of its business from commercial markets. The end result is that Boeing has avoided the downfalls of operating in the 'new normal' environment of restrained government defense budgets. At the same time, Boeing is set up perfectly to capitalize on the booming demand for commercial aircraft. This has greatly helped Boeing, as the commercial aircraft market is thriving, due to increased demand for travel in the Middle East and Asia-Pacific regions. In fact, the commercial airline order backlog for planes is at a record high. Deliveries of commercial aircraft rose 3% last year, representing the fourth consecutive record year. Going forward, Boeing should enjoy many years of growth ahead of it, thanks to its huge backlog of future orders. Boeing ended the quarter with a $485 billion backlog for nearly 5,700 commercial airplane orders. Aircraft demand has enjoyed a prolonged boom, with few signs of reversing. The major plane manufacturers have collectively received a record $1.8 trillion of orders over the next decade. Boeing has done an excellent job growing free cash flow over the past several year, and these catalysts should provide a nice runway for many years of continued growth for Boeing. With such a strong fundamental tailwind, Boeing's earnings throughout 2015 have been very good. Boeing reported earnings of $2.47 per share last quarter , easily topping analyst expectations of $2.22 per share. Revenue came in at $25.85 billion last quarter, which also exceeding analysts' forecasts for $24.74 billion. On a year-over-year basis, revenue and core earnings per share rose 9% and 18%, respectively, which are excellent growth rates. For the full year, Boeing expects earnings between $7.95 per share-$8.15 per share, with revenue clocking in at $95 billion-$97 billion. Boeing fits in with investors looking for income, growth, or a mix of both. The new annualized dividend of $4.36 per share represents a 3% yield. That is a satisfactory level of income, and is approximately 50% higher than the average yield in the S&P 500 Index. And, the $14 billion buyback, expected to be completed over the next two or three years, represents roughly 14% of the company's current market capitalization. The dividend increase gives dividend investors a strong level of income, and the buyback will be a catalyst for future earnings growth. In addition, Boeing is set up perfectly to capitalize on a fundamental tailwind. Thanks to low oil prices, airline profitability is robust. This has sparked higher demand for commercial aircraft, where Boeing has planted its flag. Boeing does maintain a defense business, and is seeing pressure from lower defense spending in the U.S. and elsewhere. But its larger commercial business is pulling its weight and then some. As a result, Boeing stock should be viewed favorably by both income and growth investors. Disclaimer: This article represents the opinion of the author, who is not a licensed financial advisor.
