Boeing Flexing Muscles One Last Time With Performance Upgrade For The Boeing 777 - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Boeing targeting 2% lower fuel burn for the performance upgraded Boeing 777. In one of my previous articles I discussed the performance upgrade on the Boeing (NYSE: BA ) 777, which should aid Boeing in receiving some much needed orders. My initial calculations assumed reduction in specific fuel consumption of 0.5% and next to that I calculated that the aerodynamic efficiency of the airframe had to be increased by roughly 1% to meet its goal of reducing total fuel burn by 2%. Boeing however shared more details about the performance upgrade and the performance upgrade is more extensive than I previously expected. I will use this article to have a look at the most significant changes on the product and the impact it will have on fuel burn figures. For the comparisons that I will make in this article I will use a Boeing 777-300ER operated in typical 9-abreast configuration. I will consider a 6000 nm mission with 15% reserve fuel, which corresponds to a flight from Dubai to New York. As mentioned in my previous article GE announced a performance upgrade to its GE90-115B engine, which should result in a 0.5% lower specific fuel consumption. The lower specific fuel consumption is to be obtained by a reduction in drag in the engine and a more efficient high-pressure compressor blisk. According to my calculations the lower specific fuel consumption will result in a 0.55% lower fuel burn. This leaves about 1.45% of fuel burn improvement to be achieved by other upgrades and tweaks. One of the changes that I did not expect to be in the performance upgrade is the reduction in weight. Weight reduction is achieved by using a lighter interior crown structure, lighter insulation for the wiring, lower density hydraulic fluid and removal of the tail skid which has been made redundant by changes to the fly by-wire control rules. The total weight reduction should be 1,200 lbs or 544 kg. This means that the empty weight of the aircraft will reduce by 0.3%, which subsequently leads to a 0.25% lower fuel burn. The engine optimization and weight reduction will result in a 0.75% lower fuel burn. Which leaves the remaining 1.25% of fuel burn reduction to be achieved by aerodynamic improvements. The elimination of the tail skid reduces drag, whereas a trailing edge device is attached to the aileron resulting in a higher wing efficiency. Additionally slat enhancements, flap fairing optimization and a new window design should reduce drag. In order to achieve this 1.25% improvement, the aerodynamic efficiency should be about 1.1% higher which is in line with my previous estimate of an increase in aerodynamic efficiency of 1%. Combining the propulsive and aerodynamic improvements as well as the weight reduction Boeing should indeed be able to cut fuel burn by 2%. Figure 1: Efficiency and weight changes for the performance upgrade (Source: Dhierin-Perkash Bechai) Figure 2: Impact efficiency changes on total fuel burn (Source: Dhierin-Perkash Bechai) Figure 2 shows that lower fuel burn will be driven by higher aerodynamic efficiency of the airframe, followed by higher propulsive efficiency and lower weight. Boeing will also be offering an optional improvement of the cabin, saving weight and space. This enables the addition of 14 revenue generating seats in the cabin. This should result in a 5% lower fuel burn per seat and compared to the current Boeing 777-300ER. My calculations show a 4.7% lower fuel burn per seat, which is in line with Boeing's aim. Figure 3: Relative fuel burn for the performance upgrade and full performance upgrade (including options) (Source: Dhierin-Perkash Bechai) Figure 3 shows that over a wider range the fuel burn is 1%-2.2% lower for the performance upgrade. For the performance upgrade along with the added seats the fuel burn is 0%-1.25% lower, but the generated revenue will be a few percent higher, offsetting the slightly lower fuel burn advantage. General Electric and Boeing are looking at the possibility to make the performance upgrade a retrofit, which extends the viable life of current Boeing 777-300ERs in service. Starting in Q3 2016 the performance upgrade will be phased in on the production line. The performance upgrade seems to be able to do what it promises: Achieving a 2% lower fuel burn The retrofit package will allow newer Boeing 777-300ERs to have a longer viable life For airlines that operate older Boeing 777s it is also attractive to order a performance upgraded Boeing 777-300ER Although the Boeing 777-300ER is more or less nearing its end, the performance upgrade shows the airframes' strength and should attract buyers, aiding Boeing in closing the production gap for the Boeing 777.
