Google's Enterprise Value Quietly Surpasses Apple | Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! I bet OPEC never factored into their analysis the lifting of the US Oil Exporting Ban in 2015 after being a non-starter for so many decades. Once upon a time, we had strong, vigorously enforced laws that made a bank the safest place to store paper assets. Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site!

For the first time since early 2014, "no brainer" Apple's Enterprise Value has fallen below that of its tech giant super-hero nemesis Alphabet (the company formerly known as Google). Since early July, Apple has lost a stunning $112 billion of 'value' while Alphabet has added over $150 billion. In September we asked "have we reached peak Apple?" it appears, for now, the answer is in. Technological change often comes faster than what the people in it’s thrall can predict. It wasn’t that long ago when you and everyone else you knew were probably using AOL Instant Messenger, around the same time that dude, you were getting a Dell . Then one day you weren’t. Blackberrys used to be so popular that “to bbm” someone made it into the dictionary, but then the devices all but disappeared. These inflection points are seldom based on the companies failing their customers, but rather because consumers simply moved on.

Tue, 12/29/2015 - 15:30 | 6975205 aliki long-only guys are completely out of "buy & hold" ideas. for this reason, they've been hiding-out in the AMZN, HD, GOOG, AAPL, GS, JPM, BAC, C, SBUX of the world. its what happens when market breadth collapses such as it has. they have to run from struggling names into names that are "brand" or revenue +. if & when that trains slows-down, it will be lights out. nowhere else to run ... nowhere else to hide with interest rates at 0.25%.  im sure with a SOLID 2.00% GDP everything will be fine. im not sure "they" realize that if GDP even slips below a 1-handle over the next 1-2 years just how fucked this market will be. only thing holding this tape together is the notion there is SOME LEVEL of positive growth. which is exactly why we never reached "escape velocity"; "they" are such short-term thinkers that "they" simply wanted to keep the stock market moving higher & slap some jobs into + territory even if the markets COMPLETELY manipulated by ZIRP and the jobs are of the shit-paying variety. Apple does too, but there is no way to really know that. At least nobody will have any money to buy the shit they are selling you from all their data mining?

Tue, 12/29/2015 - 15:38 | 6975236 OutaTime43 What does Google have other than Ads on their search engine and Youtube?  What other revenue driver is there?  The only reason why they make money is because they stick these paid PPC ads in our faces and put them over the organic search results. Before , they used to "hide" these links and now they have a tiny "AD" icon above them. I would bet that their CTR (click through rates) are declining.  They are scrambling for other revenue sources. Youtube Red is just an example.  Tue, 12/29/2015 - 16:18 | 6975429 JR Google is dangerous...because it controls the information flow. It can change the order of search results to fit its agenda. Google, in partnership with the US government, is partnered with Israel. What does Google have? It has had massive funding since the gitgo and it definitely has monopoly power over the search markets which has harmed Internet users, rivals, freedom of information and free speech, and consumers. Tue, 12/29/2015 - 16:20 | 6975428 JuliaS Google maps is not just a map. It's a different file system - a way of geographically tagging and organizing information in order to gradually assemble a meta representation of the planet that most future devices will have to be hooked into. Google will supply the environment and every company manufacturing gadgets will pay a license fee for access to google cloud. It sure costs less than trying to build a redundant database from scratch. Ford just signed a contract with them. Their business model holds more promise than Apple's as it offers great riches for minimal input down the road. Devices that tap into the database will also feed data back doing the surveying. There'll be no need for specially designed google cars even. Regular cars, phones, public transit and drones will keep feeding the beast and as smartphone makers such as Apple have discovered, people are willing to finance their own surveillance. Cost of devices heads to zero eventually and Apple, despite their effort to prove otherwise, is not an consumer eco-system firm. They are a gadget company. With eroding margins (unlike Google) they are forced to keep re-inventing themselves throwing out a new device at regular production cycles as without them the company would be dead. Google has no such pressure. Google is a filesystem, a content provider and a data aggregator. Users of their services provide content that other users pay for and further down the road we go, the more so it'll become. They're an Uber service for bits and bytes. Tue, 12/29/2015 - 16:21 | 6975432 nakki The year was 1984 (very appropriate indeed) when the entire market cap for all US stocks surpassed 2 trillion dollars for the first time. Today Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and FB are closing in on 2 trillion all by themselves. 31 years of fiat pumping into companies that either make nothing FB (add revenue) Amazon very little (streaming services and "the cloud", and no, I'm not counting being a middle man between sellers and UPS, FedEx since they don't make money there, or Kindle).  Alphabet and Apple are different at least they do make products, Apple good phone way overpriced computers, and of course Apple TV hahaha and that stupid fucking watch. Alphabet phones, don't sell many, Chromebook don't sell any and Android, and click crap adds.  Obviously they have apps and sell movies, music downloads and streaming services but at some point where the average Joe is completely taped out sales will go down. Im still not sure where all this add revenue comes from? Maybe subsidiaries of Alphabet and FB are spending money on adds and its one big Circle Jerk. I'm mean who's still paying for " likes" besides the US State Department?  31 years US market cap of all stocks up 20 trillion, US debt up 16 trillion (we know of) and wages basically stagnant. I know its not that easy but the math looks about right. Private gains for the few, Public debt for the many.  Well at least I can talk and text on a 6x3x.2 piece of plastic and I don't have to watch porn on a VCR. So I got that going for me.
