Amazon Using A Variety Of New Tactics To Continue Streaming Success - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Amazon used TCA and the time around it to really promote its upcoming slate which is poised to continue giving Netflix a run for its money. Amazon has added some big names to their roster including Billy Bob Thornton, David E. Kelley, Jeremy Clarkson and Woody Allen who will continue to draw buzz. The streaming networks have begun to see their rivals start taking pages out of their playbook which could eventually be the norm. While all the streaming buzz usually revolves around Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ), it is important to note Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) isn't just going to sit there quietly. Like Netflix did to start the annual Television Critics Association summer press tour, Amazon took its turn the other day and presented what audiences and investors should see as a solid slate. Although arguably the biggest news didn't even come out of TCA, it came the week prior. Amazon recently revealed it had lured Oscar winner Billy Bob Thornton to topline The Trial, its latest big ticket series. Now Trial is a big deal for a separate reason … it is the first "straight-to-series" order for Amazon. Until now all of their shows have been determined by a fan vote … Trial is an evolution in that process. What Amazon is doing is saying they have Thornton plus a top tier showrunner in David E. Kelley (The Practice, Boston Legal) so let's save time and just greenlight the project as we know you'll like it. It's quickly becoming apparent that Amazon sees this as its House of Cards. Instead of Kevin Spacey they have Thornton, instead of David Fincher, they have Kelley. The company was looking for a big splashy name for a series and at one point was close to landing Kevin Costner but he ultimately pulled out … Thornton though will do the job nicely. They don't want to wait another second get this on air as it has a lot of potential. Now this doesn't mean Amazon is abandoning the voting process in fact they've even made another advancement there as well. This year, for the first time, instead of giving their members just pilots produced in house they are adding one produced for a rival. Sneaky Pete, from Breaking Bad's Bryan Cranston was ordered to pilot by CBS, but passed on by the network. Amazon then scooped it up and is putting it to a vote about if it should move forward on their slate. It's a smart innovative move and shows the further changing face of TV. And I'm not even mentioning the mike-drop reveal of Amazon signing former Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson and two of its producers to make a new car-themed series for them. The controversial personality was expected to land a new job relatively quickly following his scandalous BBC exit but Amazon was a surprise selection. Now that's long term but for investors they also need to know what the company has on deck for the short term. TCA supplied a lot of that information as well with some buzzy breaking news and premiere date reveals. First Amazon revealed its next three original series Hand To God, Red Oaks and The Man in the High Castle would roll over the next three months. God starts in September with Oaks bowing in October and Castle streaming in November. All three carry with them big names and big promise. God gives Sons of Anarchy star Ron Perlman his next starring vehicle (opposite Dana Delaney) as a corrupt judge who believes the Lord is guiding him on a path of vigilante justice. Oaks is a Steven Soderbergh led comedy about college students starring Craig Roberts, Jennifer Grey, Richard Kind, Paul Reiser and Castle is based on the Phillip K. Dick novel about what life would have been like is the Axis had won World War II. In addition Amazon will roll out the next season of its award-winning Transparent this December which will then give way (presumably) to the second season of its well-received Mozart In the Jungle at the start of 2016. Transparent could end the year even hotter than when it started especially if it wins big at the Emmys (which could make it the most honored streaming show around). Based on executives comments at TCA it look like Amazon is finally playing the same game as Netflix or at least playing it more publicly than before and that's a big deal. For example we now know the Titus Welliver series Bosch is currently the net's most watched drama, but we don't by how much or any totals. Still that's a fascinating nugget dropped by the network as it answers (at least one) burning question. With NBC , Starz and others beginning to realize they too can also withhold their streaming numbers the rules about what is and isn't a hit is going to be even more blurred than before. Yet the big winner here could actually be the investors. Without ratings taken into account and based solely on buzz and reviews, I can name a half dozen broadcast and cable shows from the previous few seasons that would still be on the air. Had that happened and had it been presented as them being hits verses misses the network hierarchy would certainly be shaken up … which is exactly what Netflix and Amazon want. Amazon should be taken more seriously in this space than it has been and its future plans look like that message will be coming across very clear very soon. As a result investors should continue to keep an eye out as the website has made it clear it is here to stay.
