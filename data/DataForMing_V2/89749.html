Stephen Elop, former Nokia CEO, to leave Microsoft | Reuters Stephen Elop, vice president of Nokia, gestures while introducing the Nokia Lumia 930 mobile phone during Microsoft's ''build'' conference in San Francisco, California April 2, 2014. Microsoft Corp said former Nokia Oyj top boss, Stephen Elop, is leaving the software maker as part of a shakeup in its senior leadership. Elop, once considered a successor to former Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer, joined Microsoft to run its devices business following the company's acquisition of Nokia's handset business. The deal closed in 2014. Elop was hired as Nokia CEO in 2010 from Microsoft, where he ran the business software division. (This version of the story corrects paragraph two to say that Microsoft bought Nokia's phone business, and not the entire company, and that the deal closed in 2014, not 2013) A San Francisco Uber driver is an employee, not a contractor, according to the California Labor Commission, a decision that could dramatically increase costs for the ride-hailing service.  Full Article   Thomson Reuters is the world's largest international multimedia news agency, providing investing news , world news , business news , technology news , headline news, small business news , news alerts, personal finance , stock market , and mutual funds information available on Reuters.com, video , mobile , and interactive television platforms.
