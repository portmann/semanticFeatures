ETF Hub May 25 2015, 07:40 ET | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor A relatively lackluster holiday weekend at the box office saw Disney's (NYSE: DIS ) Tomorrowland edging other comers to top the charts with a $32.2 opening, just enough to dethrone Pitch Perfect 2 (NASDAQ: CMCSA ), which drew $30.3M. With expectations for $40M over the three-day period, Tomorrowland disappointed somewhat and earned just $26.7M overseas. Its four-day weekend domestic total is projected for $40.7M; that against a budget of $180M. The other key newcomer this week has a quicker path to profitability: The remake of Poltergeist (NASDAQ: FOXA ), whose $23M three-day take was good for fourth place and which had a budget of just $35M. In ongoing release, Mad Max: Fury Road (NYSE: TWX ) took third with $23.8M ($30M estimated for the four-day period), and Avengers: Age of Ultron ( DIS ) drew $20.9M for fifth place. Disney's super-sequel has taken a total of $404.1M domestically, but another killer weekend in China ($210M total there) has brought its global total nearer to $1.3B.
