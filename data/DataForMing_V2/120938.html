ETF Hub Ford stands to benefit from a recovering European consumer. Low fuel costs boost sales in Ford's profitable SUV and truck products. The 4.1% dividend yield is healthy and isn't going away. Ford Motor Company's (NYSE: F ) stock hasn't done much over the last five years, but now could be a great time to build a position, as both the story and the financials behind the company are compelling at these levels. Ford has been firing on all cylinders in Europe this year. The company's sales in Europe grew by 16% YoY in June , rising 10.5% for the first six months of the year. Ford's Fiesta continues to be the best-selling small car in Europe, having held that title every year since 2012. The commercial business has been even stronger, with European commercial vehicle sales having climbed 33% year-to-date. Overall, Ford is stealing market share away from competitors in Europe, having reached 8.1% in June, up 0.2 percentage points for the year. Domestically, the landscape is looking just as strong. Ford took a big risk with its aluminum-bodied F150 pickup. Competitors have been running ads boasting the strength of their steel, but reception to the aluminum-bodied Ford trucks has been extremely strong, getting a 5-star review by Car and Driver . Historically, trucks and SUVs have been Ford's highest-margin products , and the precipitous decline in fuel prices have (and will continue to) boosted those sales. Auto sales in general continue to strengthen in the United States, having doubled since early 2009: Ford is a cheap stock on almost every metric. The company produces a consistent stream of free cash flow (FCF), with more than $7 billion last year. Management consistently uses that cash to pay down long-term debt and repurchase outstanding shares. Looking forward, the stock trades at less than 8 times next year's earnings expectations, and is currently trading roughly 20% below the average analyst price target of $17.35. One of the company's strongest financial selling points may be its current 4.1% dividend yield. With $33 billion in cash and short-term investments on Ford's balance sheet, I feel confident in the security of that dividend. The company has significant exposure to the fluctuations of foreign currencies. Should the dollar continue to strengthen, Ford will continue to face FX headwinds. Additionally, should weakness arise unexpectedly in the European consumer, Ford's tremendous overseas growth could slow. Domestically, I worry about the growing strength of the UAW in compensation negotiations, especially as the balance sheet already holds high levels of debt. Finally, total revenue has been flat for several years. The tailwinds behind the company are substantial. The strengthening European consumer has flocked to Ford vehicles, as exemplified by double-digit European sales growth YoY, the Fiesta continuing its reign as Europe's best-selling small car, and Ford's growing its European market share. Meanwhile, the U.S. consumer remains exceptionally strong, and even Janet Yellen is quick to point out robust auto sales domestically . At less than 8 times next year's earnings, Ford trades at a 50% discount to the S&P 500. Additionally, the stock trades at only 8x last year's free cash flow, and let's not forget the kicker: the company pays a healthy 4.1% annual dividend. The road ahead for Ford isn't without bumps, but the company trades at an overly harsh valuation discount, and a few upside surprises could really kick the stock into gear.
