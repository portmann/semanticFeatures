Disney Set To Outperform - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Disney missed analysts' estimates on both lines for the first time in 5 years and consequently the stock has lost 7% since then. However, the segments of Studio and Parks & Resorts are firing on all cylinders. Even better, they still have great pipelines, which secure growth for the foreseeable future. Therefore, given that Disney has a similar valuation to S&P and much better growth prospects, Disney is likely to outperform the market in the near future. Disney (NYSE: DIS ) greatly disappointed investors with its fiscal Q2 earnings release about two weeks ago. The company slightly missed the analysts' estimates on both lines and the stock has declined 7% since then. As the results were only slightly below the expectations, the great question is whether the reaction of the market was justified or the stock has now fallen to bargain territory. First of all, it was the first earnings miss of the stalwart in more than 2 years while it was the first miss on both lines in the last 5 years. Therefore, it is only natural that the investment community was expecting just another beat of consensus from the company, particularly given the great success of its new movies. Hence the negative reaction of the market to the reported results is somewhat justified. The magnitude of the decline of the stock also resulted from the great concerns of the market over the secular threats of the flagship of the company, i.e., ESPN. More specifically, the market fears that young viewers find it too expensive to sign up for the bundles that include ESPN while there is an increasing number of options for consumers in the media market. Consequently, the market reacted in panic when Disney reported reduced advertising revenues from ESPN in Q2. In my opinion, the secular threats of ESPN are very real and hence they dictate a cautious stance on the issue. On the other hand, the reaction of the market was somewhat extreme, given that the operating income of the segment of Media Networks increased 9% thanks to higher affiliate revenue and lower programming and production costs of ESPN. Therefore, while the secular shift in the media sector is a major long-term concern, it seems that the company is efficiently handling the situation so far. Moreover, the company has achieved double-digit growth of its adjusted earnings per share [EPS] for 11 consecutive quarters, which is an exceptional record of consistency. In addition, while last year was a record year for the Studio of the company, the segment is still breaking one record after another this year. To be sure, Disney became the fastest studio ever to cross the $1 B threshold so early on the calendar this year. In addition, since its acquisition of Pixar, the company has released 27 movies under the Pixar, Disney Animation, Marvel and Lucasfilm brands, with an average global box office of $770 M each. In Q2, the Studio segment grew its operating income by 27%, primarily thanks to Star Wars and Zootopia, while it now holds the record of delivering 5 out of the top 6 opening weekends on record. Even better for the shareholders, the company still has a great pipeline of major upcoming movies for the next 3 years, including "Alice through the looking glass" and "Finding Dory" this summer. Therefore, the stalwart is poised to maintain its exceptional streak in this segment for the foreseeable future. Moreover, whenever the company releases a great movie, it also utilizes its leverage in the best possible way, by enhancing its earnings from the other segments, namely the Parks & Resorts and the Consumer Products. The segment of Parks and Resorts is another segment with excellent prospects at the moment. To be sure, the segment enjoyed a 10% higher operating income over last year. It is also remarkable that the attendance remained flat even though the company raised its ticket prices. This fact only reveals the strength of the business of this segment. The segment is expected to keep posting favorable trends thanks to the prevailing low gasoline prices, which offer an essential tax cut to consumers. Of course the most important news is the opening of Shanghai Disney Resort on June 16th. The company has been working on this project for 17 years and has thus managed to create a unique state-of-the-art destination, better than all the others according to the management . The company has already performed several tests on the new resort and has been totally satisfied with the enthusiastic comments of consumers. While this resort will not contribute to the earnings of the company for a while due to the start-up costs, it will certainly make a great contribution to the overall performance once these costs start to fade. More specifically, the annual revenue of the resort is expected to be about $5 B and hence it will increase the total revenue of the company by about 10%. Finally, it is important to note that Disney is trading at 17 times this year's earnings and 16 times next year's earnings. Given that the company is expected to grow its EPS by 13% this year and 7% next year, its valuation becomes even more attractive than that of S&P (NYSEARCA: SPY ), which is trading at a similar P/E ratio but is expected to have declining earnings this year and essentially flat earnings next year. Therefore, Disney is likely to outperform S&P for the foreseeable future. It is also important to note that the analysts' estimates for Disney's earnings for 2016 and 2017 have not changed at all since its earnings release. When there is a disappointing earnings release, the analysts almost always revise downwards their estimates for the future earnings of the company. Therefore, in this case, it seems that the sell-off was mostly emotionally driven, as the analysts consider the fundamentals of the company unchanged. To sum up, as ESPN is the flagship of Disney, its secular threats lead the market to overreact whenever there is a dark spot in its performance. However, investors should note that ESPN is finding it increasingly hard to grow but is not in a decline. Even better, the other two segments of the company, the Studio and the Parks & Resorts, are firing on all cylinders while they still have a great pipeline of upcoming projects. Therefore, Disney is likely to keep growing at decent rates for the foreseeable future and hence its stock is likely to benefit from that growth, even though the growth pace may not be as spectacular as it used to be.
