Mea Culpa On SunEdison - Cramer's Mad Money (8/20/15) | Seeking Alpha Aug. 21, 2015  7:43 AM ET  |  Includes: BBT , CRM , D , DIS , GLBL , HES , HRL , SUNE , VDSI , VSLR by: SA Editor Mohit Manghnani People are willing to pay less for growth than they did previously. Salesforce is on track for $10B revenue. "I think you can say that Aug. 4 was the day the growth music died, at least for now," said Cramer. He was referring to Disney (NYSE: DIS ) which started falling after it reported a minor subscriber loss. Till then Disney was the best performing stock of the Dow. "Ever since that conference call, the only cartoon character I can think about when Disney pops into my mind is Humpty Dumpty, because it seems that all the Street's horses and all the Street's men can't put Humpty Dumpty back together again," added Cramer. The conference call laid out a road map for ESPN, Star Wars and Shanghai Disney but all was ignored. The strange thing is that there have been no estimate cuts or reductions in the street estimates and the company has been buying stock at these prices. The EPS estimates are too low and the company has a lot to offer in the future. Think about what it means for the market, when a stock like Disney can fall from $122 to $100 in few weeks without any estimate cut. The media space has become dangerous suddenly. "This market has gotten narrower and narrower by the day. Stocks have been under distribution for ages, meaning they have been sold relentlessly and not necessarily to good hands," said Cramer. He concluded that investors are not ready to pay as much for future earnings as they were earlier. This is proven by the fact that Disney's stock declined even though there were no estimate cuts. In fact, Hormel Foods (NYSE: HRL ) is one of the few stocks that has survived in the selloff. The only positive side of the selloff is that stocks come to a point where they become cheap and investors will benefit from buying them. Cramer wants investors to accept that they were paying too much for Disney's earnings. The stock has to come to a point where they feel it's worth paying for future earnings and with Thursday's plunge, Cramer thinks that the worst for the stock is not over. Cramer was wrong about SunEdison (NYSE: SUNE ) SunEdison has been in freefall since July 20 and has lost 60% of its value. From 2013 till July 20, the stock was up almost 7 times. "First, let me just say; Mea culpa! Clearly, I was wrong to get behind this one. It was a mistake to recommend SunEdison and I own that," said Cramer. SunEdison's plan was to spin off into 2 yieldco subsidiaries which would purchase its solar projects and pay shareholders dividend. After Cramer recommended the stock on April 9th, it went up by 28% till July 20 to decline heavily. As oil prices started to fall rapidly, SunEdison's stock also kept falling. It all started with Vivint Solar's (NYSE: VSLR ) acquisition when investors realized that the company did not have enough money to fund the acquisition. Then it was TerraForm Global (NASDAQ: GLBL ), the IPO of which was a big failure and the company could raise only $675m against the planned $1B. Finally, SunEdison reported earnings with better than expected revenues and larger than expected losses and the stock fell 25% on that day. Last week SunEdison announced a deal with Dominion (NYSE: D ) and also announced a plan to raise capital for its funding worries. Cramer thinks the stock represents good value now but it is still in a freefall state. "I got SunEdison wrong. The company overextended itself, continuing to make big acquisitions when it became clear that the market had turned against them. I think that long-term investors can start to gradually build a position here on the way down," he added. The market has been bad and people are looking for answers to the question - what will trigger a market rally? Cramer has the solution. "I do find it helpful to figure out what would reverse that ineluctable sense of retreat so if I spotted it, I would know that the overwhelming propensity for a declining session isn't as written in stone as we thought," he said. Fed needs to declare 2015 a rate-free hike zone so that the dangers of a strong dollar do not hit USA and its trading partners. Chinese market needs to reset as the Shanghai Composite index is filled with overvalued stocks. The market needs to lose 35-40% of its value. Commodities have to bottom as currently they are free falling in a bottomless pit. Oil has been behaving as if demand/supply rules do not apply to it. This has Saudi Arabia's oversupply written all over it and that has to stop. CEO interview - Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM ) On a bad market day, Cramer heard some good news as Salesforce beat earnings by $0.02, had better than expected revenues and it raised full year guidance to be on track for $7B revenue. Cramer interviewed Chairman and CEO Marc Benioff to hear more about the quarter. "This is the best quarter we have ever had. You can see these numbers are just incredible, and we see having an unbelievable year. Next year, we are going to be the fourth-largest software company in the world, that's our goal," said Benioff. The company's deferred revenue is greater than $9B and the customers are growing faster than ever. The company is on a trajectory for $10B revenue as they are in the center of the Internet of Things. Hess (NYSE: HES ): "Hess has a good balance sheet and they've done a lot of smart things. Oil companies are going down no matter what." Vasco Data Security (NASDAQ: VDSI ): One of the most heated areas is cybersecurity as people are not willing to pay as much for growth as they were earlier. BB&T (NYSE: BBT ): The stock has to come down before one can buy. "You will get better prices before you can buy."
