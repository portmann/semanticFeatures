Eli Lilly Is An Outright Buy At $72 - Cramer's Lightning Round (2/22/16) | Seeking Alpha Boeing is good, but cannot be recommended due to accounting irregularities. Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY ): The stock is an outright buy at $72. They might have good Alzheimer's news later this year. Spectra Energy (NYSE: SE ): "CEO Greg Ebel really does run a true utility that yields 5%, but I've got to tell you in the end it is going to be fossil fuel aided. If oil goes down, it will get hammered." AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV ): "Jefferies is recommending AbbVie and I thought it was quite compelling. It seems cheap." Chipotle ( CMG.B ) (NYSE: CMG ): It's done going down. Cramer thinks people will not be thinking about E.coli 6 months from now. It's worth buying Chipotle even at current levels. Boeing (NYSE: BA ): Cramer likes Boeing but the accounting issues make it difficult to recommend.
