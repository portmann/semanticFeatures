Apple: Collusion, Competition, Content And Unseating Spotify - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha AAPL is being investigated by the attorney generals of New York and Connecticut. This time the AGs are investigating AAPL for collusion and violation of antitrust rules in regards to Apple Music. I believe this investigation will turn up wanting and I lay out the case for Apple Music to unseat Spotify as the leader in the space. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is being investigated for violations of antitrust rules and collusion by the attorney generals of New York and Connecticut. What else is new? At this point, post-"e-book" scandal should it be expected both Mr. Schneiderman and Mr. Jepsen to investigate all product releases and iterations of software going forward? Should Tim Cook, AAPL CEO, simply appoint both gentlemen to the Board or forward all product development plans to their offices directly? I'm exaggerating of course but barely. Listen, AAPL is going to continue to come under regulatory scrutiny any time it appears as if the competitive pendulum swings too far in its direction - regardless of the endpoint. The competitive pendulum, if you will, swings often in the direction of AAPL so just get comfortable with the process folks. This endpoint just so happens to be music. Once AAPL is able to establish its News as the premier content marketing platform , I expect there to be an investigation as to whether or not AAPL colluded with publishers. This is just the nature of being the benchmark, to which AAPL is. But this isn't a fanboy assessment of AAPL or its positioning in the music space. I'll acknowledge that Spotify, the Unicorn that is close to becoming a Decacorn, does stand to be a hurdle on the way to AAPL yet again revolutionizing a platform and yet again being the single most dominant force in a space. Yesterday, just one day post-WWDC15, Spotify closed a Series G round worth $526 million that values the company at $8.53 billion - up from a prior valuation of $8 billion. That's 2X current Pandora's (NYSE: P ) valuation and ~3X what AAPL paid for Beats By Dre. So, to think that Spotify is going to fold up and go away is to not realize the reality of the situation. Spotify is smart, it's agile, it has 60 million users (15 million or 25% of which have been converted to paying subscribers), and it did $1.3 billion in full year 2014 revenues (91% subscription revenue based). Spotify is real and it matters. BUT, Spotify did report a net loss of $197 million and that my friends is its chink in its armor. AAPL will gut and publicly execute Spotify using two methods - creating a race to zero (read: pricing pressure) and having a better content distribution platform for music. I'll explain both. Companies can operate at a significant loss for a long, long time. Borderline in perpetuity. That said, typically this is only the scenario when there appears to be a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. When that company is the leader in the space, has differentiation, and has defensiveness - or at least the appearance it could acquire it. With Spotify, it has none of these characteristics. So, the question becomes how long will Spotify investors continue to throw money into a fire of greater and greater size when AAPL undoubtedly decides to put as much pressure on Spotify's model via lower pricing, longer free trial periods - which already stand at 3 full months, etc.? How long? How long will it be before AAPL can example to the music industry the greater levels of efficacy of using its platform and its unique ability to allow for free video and/or music to be distributed without cost to the artist/label/consumer via its Connect platform? How long? We'll soon find out the answer. Actually, answers will be all around. Answers to the all-important investigation being deployed by our public servants Mr. Schneiderman and Mr. Jepsen, answers to the question of the level of pain tolerance by those who have participated in the $1.1 billion of funding raised to date by Spotify, and answers to the question of will or will not the consumers show a level of loyalty that they have never collectively shown to any application once a better value-prop comes along. AAPL is offering a better value prop via its Apple Music. Rumors of AAPL's demise, at least in my opinion, have been greatly exaggerated. I continue to recommend AAPL as a Core Position.
