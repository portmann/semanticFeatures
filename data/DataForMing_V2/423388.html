Viewing that kind of base humanity through the miasma of quiet desperation is the stuff of Raymond Carver or Tom Waits’ songs… or Silicon Valley mergers . Jack Dorseyâ€™s struggling social network met with Yahooâ€™s management, led by Chief Executive Marissa Mayer, several weeks ago to discuss a possible merger of the companies, sources told The Post. Marissa Mayer and Jack Dorsey letting their bleary eyes linger upon the other as Dolly Parton croons on the jukebox and the night turns into morning feels like a Silicon Valley-based Bukowski poem. At the management meeting, Twitter and Yahoo execs spent several hours hashing out Yahooâ€™s financials, and whether a strategic combo might make sense, according to sources close to the talks. â€œTwitter is the destination for instant news, and Yahoo has a lot of eyeballs on its site,â€? said one source. â€œThe idea isnâ€™t as crazy as you might think.â€? Really? Because it seems pretty crazy to us, pal. And apparently it seemed a little crazy to someone else… Indeed, one source noted that Twitter CEO Dorsey didnâ€™t even bother to show up for the Yahoo meeting. So maybe Twitter was only half drunk and three-quarters desperate. Sure, flirting with Yahoo is harmless and fun, but waking up with Yahoo in the morning would have had consequences. As for Twitter, Dorsey has enough problems fixing his own company, which has seen user growth flatline, insiders said. â€œTheyâ€™re very scared their shareholders would be outragedâ€? by a Yahoo bid, one source said of Twitter. â€œWhich is not, quite frankly, an unfounded fear.â€?
