BlackBerry Priv And Microsoft Lumia 950 Receiving Plenty Of Interest - BlackBerry Ltd. (NASDAQ:BBRY) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I am/we are long BBRY. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. Priv and Lumia 950 compare favorably to other smartphones released in November. Interest in both Priv and Lumia 950 outpace Sony Xperia and Moto G by a wide margin. BlackBerry (NASDAQ: BBRY ) has adopted Android with the launch of the Priv and in the process created a lot of controversy over whether the company is dead in the water or on the verge of a resurgence in smartphones. Data on sales are sparse and advocates of key brands like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) are almost vicious in attacking BlackBerry, akin to kicking someone while they are down. At the same time, Microsoft is getting serious about mobile phones with its launch of the flagship Lumia 950 series. An objective metric of the acceptance of any particular new phone is available by monitoring the traffic on key smartphone websites like GSM Arena. Here's a screen shot of the traffic reviewing the BlackBerry Priv. To form a judgment whether 1,877,876 hits or 337 fans is good or bad one needs to compare the data to other smartphones launched at about the same time as the November 2015 Priv introduction. Likewise, the Priv has garnered more attention than the Moto G Turbo Edition released at the same time as the Priv despite the wide appeal of the Moto G based on its lower price point. Microsoft's new flagship Lumia 950 launched at the same time as the Priv and has had a similar level of interest modestly outpacing the response to the Priv. The final comparison is (as you might expect) to the iPhone 6S Plus released almost two months before the Priv. The top-of-the-line iPhone gained somewhat more interest based on the number of people viewing it on GSM Arena, but perhaps less than you might expect given it has been out for quite a bit longer. The point of all these comparisons is that BlackBerry and Microsoft are far from dead and each of their latest smartphones is attracting interest. I'm sure that if BlackBerry could sell one third as many Priv's as Apple sells iPhone 6S Plus models, BBRY shareholders would be more than happy. I have no doubt Microsoft will make its smartphone unit a profitable contributor. Tagged: Investing Ideas , Technology
