Click to print (Opens in new window) Earning calls can be a drag, full of heavily massaged numbers and industry jargon meant to make anyone listening fall asleep. To spice things up, T-Mobile has created a drinking game, but not for their own magenta-hued earnings. Instead, T-Mo is intent on getting everyone drunk while listening to AT&T’s quarterly report. In advance of today’s earnings news from AT&T, T-Mobile released “AT&T Earnings Call: The Drinking Game,” as a follow-up to a similar libation-heavy game that targeted Verizon . [To be clear, we at Consumerist do not in any way condone or encourage the idea of drinking (potentially a lot of) alcohol during any earnings calls, even AT&T’s.] “AT&T and Verizon have lots in common: more love for accountants and lawyers than customers, a fear of T-Mobile and terribly boring and jargon-heavy earnings calls (to name just a few),” T-Mobile said in the announcement. “Since we had so much fun with the Verizon earnings call, we decided to order up another round of drinking game goodness for AT&Tâ€™s call on Tuesday.” earnings call , which kicks off at 4:30 p.m. (EST) today, takes the form of many other drinking games with a “take (number of) drink(s) if…” format. For example, listeners are to take one drink each time AT&T says “profitable growth,” or everyone’s favorite buzzword, “internet of things.” Two drinks are to be swigged if the company “hides phone losses under a mountain of cheap connected cars and free tablets,” or three drinks if CEO Randall Stephenson “shows up to his own earnings call.” Players, we mean listeners, are to finish their drink if AT&T “grows a heart and decides to end overages.” Click to print (Opens in new window) T-Mobile To Dangle “Risk-Free” 14-Day Trial For Verizon Customers Verizon Promises Live Sports On New Mobile Streaming TV Service — But Not The Ones You Actually Watch T-Mobile Claims It’s Bigger Than Sprint, Open To Working With Dish On Wireless Services AT&T, Verizon Responses To Campaign To End Robocalls Unsurprisingly Empty And Noncommittal « 3 Maple Syrup Facts Every Breakfast Fan Should Know Walmart Comes To Town, Other Stores Close, Then Walmart Leaves 3 Reasons Why 'House Hunters' Will Likely Outlast The Apocalypse Consumerist is currently testing a new user experience.
