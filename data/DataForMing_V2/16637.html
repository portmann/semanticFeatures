Intel And Qualcomm: A Regression Analysis Of Dividend Growth And Stock Price | Seeking Alpha Qualcomm's (QCOM) share price has historically been more responsive to dividends than that of Intel. Qualcomm may appeal more to income-oriented investors in this regard. However, with Intel's (INTC) growth far outpacing that of Qualcomm in the past year, growth-oriented investors are likely to find more favour in this stock. The purpose of this article is to use regression analysis methodologies in investigating the effects of dividend growth on the overall returns of both Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ). At the outset, this article is not necessarily seeking to examine which is the better investment - however a greater understanding of how each company's stock price moves in line with dividend growth may be of use to investors in determining whether Intel and Qualcomm may be better suited to a growth-oriented or income-oriented strategy. Since 2005, both Intel and Qualcomm have shown consistent growth in dividend payments. However, we can see that on a cumulative basis, Qualcomm has grown dividends by 35% while Intel has grown dividends by 15% over the same period: Source: nasdaq.com/Author's Calculations A growth-oriented investor is understandably not as concerned about dividend growth as an income-oriented investor. In this regard, a growth-oriented investor may be inclined to choose Intel if the company had a history of significantly outperforming on the basis of capital gains. An income-oriented investor on the other hand would prefer a stable stream of income over rapid growth, and in this sense Qualcomm would be seen as more suitable. However, many investors lie between these two spectrums in reality, and dividend growth invariably has a material effect on stock price. In this regard, I use an Ordinary Least Squares regression along with cointegration analysis to quantify the impact of dividend growth on stock price from 2005-present, and also determine the significance of the relationship between the two. From the above, several insights become clear: 1) The OLS regression indicates that dividend growth has a much more material effect on Qualcomm than Intel. For instance, for every 1% in dividend growth, Qualcomm's stock price rises by 0.55% whereas that of Intel rises by 0.39%. 2) Moreover, with an R-Squared figure of 0.7502 for Qualcomm and 0.3161 for Intel, the impact of dividends on Qualcomm's share price is indicated to be more significant. 3) Additionally, the Phillips-Ouliaris test for cointegration is significant at the 5% level for Qualcomm whereas the test shows insignificant results for Intel. This implies that dividends and stock price follows a random walk for Intel; i.e. the two variables are random and do not necessarily move in step. However, presence of cointegration in Qualcomm's case implies that dividend growth and stock price has a more significant relationship; i.e. the two are more likely to converge over time. So, what does this tell us in layman terms? While this does not reveal whether Intel or Qualcomm is the better investment per se, it does indicate that investors looking for a blend of growth in both share price and income are more likely to find this with Qualcomm. For instance, if Intel were to announce a dividend raise and an investor bought the stock with the expectation that Intel's share price would rise also, there is a significant chance he/she would be disappointed. However, Qualcomm might likely appeal more to investors who are expecting capital gains at least partially derived from dividend growth. In conclusion, the analysis in this article would suggest that Qualcomm might be a better choice for investors seeking a long-term income-oriented strategy across firms in the semiconductor industry. In terms of growth, Intel has been the clear winner lately, appreciating by 24% in the past year versus -15% for Qualcomm. Therefore, Intel looks like a stock more suited towards high growth whereas Qualcomm represents more of a long-term income investment.
