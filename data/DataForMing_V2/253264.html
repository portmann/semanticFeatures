Netflix continues dizzying run - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Dec  2 2015, 12:48 ET | By: Clark Schultz , SA News Editor Netflix ( NFLX +3.5%) crossed over $130 for the first time today as a new all-time high was set once again. The YTD return on the streamer stands at +166%. Some analysts think the stock is benefiting from the company's simple selling model which doesn't get tied down with retail overhangs. There is also new data out this week that underscores that the younger generation is moving straight into streaming services while bypassing traditional cable, perhaps at an even higher rate than forecast. I'm not a short, but I really wonder who has the guys to hold this after the huge run in the lasts 10 days. On other hand, maybe longs feel that shorts are only holding on by their fingertips, and sooner or later they're gonna havta sell, creating an even bigger squeeze than we've been seeing.
