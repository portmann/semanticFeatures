Has Facebook Topped? - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Recently Facebook changed its advertising policy where now advertisers will only be paying for external clicks to their websites. Now we will see how engaged Facebook's users really are. It looks likely that Facebook's privacy problems in Europe are going to elevated over time. This can only slow revenue growth as less info will be gathered over time. A lot of technical damage has been done to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq over the past few weeks. I can't see both indexes recovering any time soon. Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) almost reached $100 a share this year but has since slipped back to sub $90 levels. Marc Zuckerburg announced very recently that 1 billion people used the company's platform in one single day. This number was a significant milestone but you have to wonder where will Facebook's growth come from going forward. Furthermore most of the users presently on the platform are in the Americas and Europe with the US accounting for almost half of Facebook's revenue. I have no doubt that the pending "airborne drones" initiative and the current rollout of "Internet.org" will increase users. But what Facebook really goes by is advertising revenue per user. With 7 billion people currently on the planet, the company can still be scaled aggressively but profit margins will need to increase once more (operating margins are declining on average year-over-year) and engagement will need to be better. Currently the average engagement time on the platform is under 50 minutes which is not enough going forward. The company is presently pushing video uploads a lot which will definitely improve engagement times among its users, but it still has a lot to do in terms of variety before the company will be able to coax YouTube users over to its platform. Yes, the company has many things going for it, but I just feel the drawbacks over power the positives. Lets discuss in detail. We're updating CPC to only account for what we call 'link clicks' - i.e., the clicks related to certain ad objectives such as clicks to visit another website. Once this change goes into effect advertisers who care about link clicks are likely to see better return on advertising spend, since they'll be paying for only the most valuable outcome. Separating link clicks from engagement clicks (including likes and comments) means your budget will be spent more efficiently no matter if you bid for clicks or engagement." So the bottom line is that advertisers will now only pay for external clicks (clicks that go to their websites) and will not be charged for internal clicks. Facebook in terms of an advertising platform is still in its infancy. Metrics up to now were not able to be evaluated accurately but now they will be. Just as Facebook can calculate to the cent how much a user is worth, advertisers now (with the updated system) will be able to calculate the average cost of a lead. However having a lead is one thing, making a sale is another, so we have to go deeper. I studied marketing a few years ago where I saw that leads from social network platforms were not as valuable as leads from a search engine or article. It makes sense that lead to sale metrics or ROI metrics are in this order in terms of ROI efficiency: The add which coverts over time a lead to sale the most is a newsletter add or an add embedded into an engaged article. The problem with advertising on social media is that users normally are not in buying mode. On the contrary, when reading an article or newsletter about a product, the user is actively engaged in the buying process. Over time marketers and advertisers will see that social media leads or traffic are not as potent as other leads from other media. It stands to reason. People go on Facebook to interact, not to look for information on products. Furthermore the more Facebook puts advertising in front of its users, the more it runs the risk of having a mass exodus of users long term. Secondly, It's apparent that Facebook's problems in Europe are not going to go away any time soon. Many countries such as France, Spain and Germany have pending cases with Facebook that have yet to be resolved but the most recent highlighted case is Belgium. Belgian data protective authorities want to file suit as they have seen that Facebook is still tracking users even when: The user is not logged into Facebook Facebook has more or less confirmed that it uses cookies to target advertising when the user is off its platform. But the tech company is still stating that it only needs to go through its Irish hub regarding any regulation or privacy queries. I have seen this in other industries also and it is really riling a lot of people. Ever since Europe was opened up, many sectors (international financial planning is another) have flourished because only one licence or hub is needed in one EU country in order to operate legally in all 28 countries. This will indeed change which will probably slow growth in the EU as independent countries will have more power over tech companies operating in their space. Furthermore, Facebook is still waiting on Europe's decisions with regard to the NSA/PRISM dragnet surveillance program. This ruling will be announced this month. The more info that comes out about Facebook either breaching privacy policy or sharing private information, the worse it will be for this tech giant. Moreover with the stock trading at almost 100 times earnings, future user numbers seem to be priced in. The speed at which the company wants to grow may be a derailing factor here, especially in Europe. A lot of technical damage has been done here. First the 200-day moving average has been penetrated and both the 50 and 200 daily moving averages have crossed over. The Nasdaq (INDEXNASDAQ:.IXIC) also has been hit hard. The tech sector has had a huge run up over the last few years with Facebook being no different since its IPO. Furthermore, the company doesn't pay a dividend so I see little downside protection here at present.
