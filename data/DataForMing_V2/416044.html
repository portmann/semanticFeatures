Apple: Carl Icahn Not The Only One Selling - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Carl Icahn was a major seller of Apple stock last quarter. Last week I compiled a list of value investors who bought Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) stock during Q1 2016, which you can find here . The article got a lot of interest and investors were wondering who was on the other side of these trades, except Carl Icahn (since he was everywhere in financial news outlets about him selling his position). So, I've compiled a list of notable sellers during the first quarter of 2016. David Tepper ( Appaloosa Management LP ): David sold his whole position during the first quarter, which was 1.26 million shares. He took a big lost on his position, since he first reported this position on the 8/14/15 filing. He would have bought these shares during that time in the $120 range. Chase Coleman ( Tiger Global Management ): Chase sold 4.94 million shares during the quarter. He now holds 5.65 million shares valued at currently around $563 million. His position still makes up about 9% of his total portfolio. Also, I would like to note this was a new position for him in the prior quarter (Q4 2015). Ray Dalio ( Bridgewater Associates ): Ray sold 221,452 shares worth approximately $22 million. This was 67.6% reduction in his position in Apple. He now currently holds only 106,000 shares. John Griffin ( Blue Ridge Capital ): John sold about 3% of his position or 60,000 shares. He now holds 1.94 millions shares value currently around $193 million. Jim Simon ( Renaissance Technologies ): Jim closed out his whole position during the quarter, which was 4.46 million shares. This was a new holding the quarter before, so he took a loss on this purchase. Going through his buy and sells of Apple stock, he has basically been trading it over the past few years. Manning & Napier Advisors : Manning and Napier Advisors sold 131,340 shares, which was about 3.34% of their position. The company still has 3.8 million shares in their portfolio. Apple was a haven for big investors. Recently though, there were some major sellers of company. With the worries over China and possible earnings shrinkage, the stock got punished. The price has come back as of late. It will be interesting to see if some of these sellers will become buyers during this quarter because of the drastic drop in price or did they do more selling.
