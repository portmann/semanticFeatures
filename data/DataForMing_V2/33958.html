Ford's Growth Outside The United States Makes It A Great Buy At Current Levels - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Trading at only $15.85, shares in F are currently yielding a respectable 3.8% dividend. Poor performance in Europe and South America has been dragging the company's profitability down. However, recent news suggests this may change. In my most recent article on Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F ), "High Demand For Ford's New F-150 Makes The Company A Buy At Current Prices," I said: "At 10 times forward earnings, the company isn't very expensive, and the 3.75% dividend will pay investors to wait as the company attempts to reduce its losses in South America and Europe." Shares in the company have dropped by 1% since then and are currently trading at $15.85, with a dividend yield of 3.79%. With the Kansas City Assembly Plant now up and running and with very high demand for the new F-150, I don't see any bearish signals for the U.S. part of the company. As I mentioned in my most recent article, the company is still not making any profit in both Europe and South America. However, recent news on the company has led me to be more optimistic on the company's future profitability outside of the United States. For example, Ford's March sales in Europe were up by an amazing 14.4%, which is well above the industry average growth of 11.6%. The company sold 168,400 vehicles, the majority of which were the company's Fiesta (28.2%) and Focus (19.1%) models. Ford sold a total of 335,100 cars in Europe in the first quarter of 2015, which is a YoY increase of 12.5%. Ford will release a number of new models in Europe this year, including the new C-Max, S-Max and Galaxy models, as well as the Mustang fastback and Convertible, which will help boost sales even further. In the most recent fiscal year, Ford's losses in Europe were $1.06 billion before taxes. If the company manages to regain profitability in Europe, it will not only increase its earnings per share, but also reduce its dependency on the US market, giving the company a more diversified stream of income. Ford recently announced it would invest $2.5 billion in engine and transmission plants in Mexico, which will add around 3,800 jobs, which shows dedication to growing its presence in South America, a segment which had a pre-tax loss of $1.16 billion last fiscal year. The company is also doing quite well in China . In the first three months of the current fiscal year, the company sold 296,825 vehicles, which is 9% more than last year. The company opened a new assembly plant in March, bringing the total number to six. This plant will increase the company's production capacity by 250,000 vehicles. Russia remains a troublesome region for Ford, with sales for the first quarter down by as much as 71% compared to the same quarter last year. Still, the company remains optimistic, as can be seen by the fact it plans to release four new models in Russia this year . Ford operates a joint venture with the Russian company Sollers. On April 10th, Reuters reported Ford would provide additional financial support to the venture, which is another sign of the company's dedication to growing in the Russian market. Furthermore, Ford will have future rights to buy Sollers from the venture, which is responsible for local production, sales and import of Ford's vehicles in Russia. Considering all this good news which has recently been released, it's quite strange to see Ford trading at only $15.85 a share, which is well below the 52-week high of $18.12. With analysts expecting the company to have earnings per share of $1.58 in the current fiscal year and $1.87 next year, Ford appears very cheap.
