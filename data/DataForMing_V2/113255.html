Sell Micron, Intel And Microsoft On Free Fall In PC Shipments | Seeking Alpha According to Gartner, Q2 PC shipments fell 9.5% Y/Y. IDC estimates the fall was closer to 12%. The encroachment of cheaper notebook PCs that require less DRAM or cheaper processors could further punish Micron and Intel. According to Gartner Q2 2015 PC shipments declined 9.5% Y/Y to 68.4 million - the steepest decline since Q3 2013; IDC estimated the decline to be around 12%. This makes the respective declines of 6.7% and 1% in Q1 2015 and Q4 2014 look tame. Gartner now projects total 2015 shipments to be off 4.4% Y/Y. The following chart outlines the trend in PC shipments: Each of the top 5 PC vendors experienced sales declines. ASUS and Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ ) fared the worst with declines of 10.2% and 9.5%, respectively. Unit sales of vendors outside the top 5 declined by over 20%; this reinforces the thesis that PC manufacturers are bifurcated between the "haves" and "have nots." Other recurring themes are as follows: 2014 PC sales were buoyed by strong desk-based PC growth in advance of the phasing out of Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Windows XP support. If 2014 was a high-water mark for PC sales, then PC vendors and manufacturers of semiconductors and PC-related software may have also benefited. If 2014 was a high-water mark, then Q2 2015's "relative performance" may appear less ominous. The Windows 10 launch is scheduled for Q3 2015. This quarter's PC shipments may be understated if vendors and channels are clearing inventory in advance of its launch. Whether pent-up demand for Win10 will spur PC sales, we will know by next quarter. In the U.S. PC shipments declined by 5.8%. Mobile PC shipments actually grew by single digits, but was offset by double-digit declines of desk-based shipments. According to Gartner, desk-based PC shipments faced the steepest decline since 2009 amid the financial crisis. The sharp fall in PC shipments is ominous for Micron (NASDAQ: MU ), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) and Microsoft. The following chart outlines their exposure to the PC space: DRAM is about 61% of Micron's total revenue and 30% of that is sold into the PC market. Micron's problem is twofold - [i] PC shipments are declining, yet [ii] mobile PCs which require less DRAM are encroaching on desk-based PCs. This could hurt both DRAM volume and average sales price ("asp"). The situation may not abate any time soon as, according to Gartner , affordable thin/light notebooks are now attracting more business buyers. In its most recent quarter , Micron's revenue was off 8% sequentially, while gross margins fell from 35% to 30% due to a mix shift from DRAM (which has higher margins) to NAND. The company is shifting production from PCs - where it has less pricing power - to the mobile space where Samsung (SNLF) is attempting to ring-fence the market. According to TrendForce Samsung and Apple control about 48% of the mobile phone market. Samsung supplies DRAM to its internal smartphone division and is rumored to become a major supplier for Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPhone 6S due out later this year. Intel is the leader in sales of semiconductors for personal computers. Like Micron, it could experience declining volume and asp as [i] total PC sales decline and [ii] and cheaper mobile PCs - which are growing - may require cheaper processors. Intel's PC sales are embedded in its Client Computing segment (58% of revenue); this newly created segment also includes Intel's mobile operations, which was previously bleeding cash . Intel recently agreed to acquire Altera (NASDAQ: ALTR ) for nearly $17 billion. Altera is expected to buttress Intel's sales for the Internet-of-Things and data centers. At least for now, the PC space remains an outsized part of the Intel story and investors should avoid the stock. Microsoft's Consumer Licensing Group (16% of revenue) and Commercial Licensing Group (46% of revenue) are heavily dependent on software for PCs. They also represent over 60% of its $22 billion in quarterly revenue. Last quarter, revenue from its popular Surface Pro 3 notebook computer ($713 million) grew 44% Y/Y. The Surface Pro 3 also acts as a hedge against notebooks encroaching on desk-based PC shipments; however, I don't think it can offset a 9.5% decline in overall PC sales. Another development is the emergence of Microsoft's cloud services segment which grew 45% Y/Y and has a revenue run-rate of $6.3 billion. However, after a $7.6 billion write-off of Microsoft's Nokia phone unit, investors should avoid the stock. Declining PC shipments are ominous for Micron, Intel and Microsoft. Until they can find other sources of revenue to offset this decline, these stocks are a sell. Source: Sell Micron, Intel And Microsoft On Free Fall In PC Shipments Disclosure: I am/we are short MU.
