The Apple-Google Divorce - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Between them Apple and Google dominate the device market. New updates to their software puts the companies in a collision course in services. Wintel was the easy tech investment at the turn of the century - Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Windows software running on Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) hardware. Over the last decade this has been replaced by Goople - Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) services running on Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) hardware. While the Wintel Empire fell over basic technology change, devices and clouds replacing PCs and servers, it appears that Goople may fall for a different reason, as explained by analyst Bruce Springsteen of the E-Street Band. "Poor man want to be rich, rich man want to be king, and a king ain't satisfied till he rules everything." The alliance has always been an uneasy one. After the iPhone was launched, Google was quick to respond with its open source Android system, which copied most iPhone functions and was meant to surround it with a host of OEMs, as Microsoft had done to Apple decades before. Apple fanbois now insist they have met the threat and defeated it. Apple's share of even the global smartphone market is increasing. The two operating systems now have 96% of the market, which is monopoly control in anyone's book. The response by Apple has been to seek more control over the services running on it than it had before, and this puts it on a collision course with Google. You see it first in the area of voice interfaces, Apple's Siri vs. Google Now. Google Now does not work well unless you're also using other Google services, like Mail, Calendar and Maps. At its Worldwide Developer Conference last week Apple announced a new version of Siri that supports "preemptive notifications" which don't work well unless you're running the Apple alternatives. Across the technology market, Apple and Google are increasingly on a collision course. Apple offers HomeKit for the Internet of Things. Googlke has been investing heavily in cars, robots and wearables, both directly and through OEMs. Apple has the Watch, Google has Android Wear. So far, investors are betting that Apple will win. Apple shares are up 15% this year, Google shares 3%. Apple has twice the market cap of Google, $765 billion vs. $369 billion. The question is whether this will continue, now that the two companies have one another firmly fixed in the others' sights. Remember, Google still has four times the market share in smartphones that Apple has. Google, the service, has an equally dominant market share, and Apple has nothing to compete with it. On the other hand Apple has momentum, and management that is firmly focused on its goal of bringing Google down, while Google seems to lack focus under CEO Larry Page. So if you had to own one of these stocks, which would you own? I still own both, but the time is approaching where even I must choose. Disclosure: The author is long GOOGL, AAPL.
