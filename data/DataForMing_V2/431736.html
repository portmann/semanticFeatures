Disney: Don't Abandon Infinity - License It - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Disney recently stated that it would not be producing more Infinity titles. While Disney probably shouldn't publish videogames, it should aggressively increase its licensing programs in this area. Disney (NYSE: DIS ) decided to exit the videogame business. At least, it decided to exit the business of directly producing software and toys-to-life products (i.e., Disney Infinity ). But the company isn't totally out of videogames; instead, it apparently wants to switch to a familiar strategy: license its properties to publishers. Electronic Arts' (NASDAQ: EA ) Battlefront title is a recent example. The licensing model always made sense to me. Why directly publish games and take the risk? Even when times were great in the industry, when physical discs weren't disrupted by digital delivery and price points weren't as controversial (people seem to dislike paying over $30 for a game these days more than they did in the past, in my anecdotally-based opinion), and when mobile casual platforms weren't competing for the attention of users, I always wondered why Disney was investing in developers. Taking increased risk on by producing filmed content, episodic series and park attractions was logical since that was the company's core business competency; directly producing such ancillary consumer products based on IP that was already expensively developed didn't appear as attractive as sitting back and collecting payments from others - as IP moves its way through other channels, it would seem requisite that keeping the profit margin high would be desirable since the goal is to make one big investment on a franchise and then develop a long tail of monetization whose risk is funded by other entities. Disney should therefore certainly not shutter its Infinity line completely, then (it's hard for me to believe that's the true plan) . I would like to see, as a shareholder of the company, these figures ported over to another toys-to-life platform. Would Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ATVI ) be interested in developing future iterations of Infinity for its Skylanders portal? Possibly, one might argue. Then there's Lego Dimensions and its gaming system. Nintendo has Amiibo; perhaps Nintendo ( OTCPK:NTDOY ) would be the most logical choice for an Infinity comeback, given not only the videogame company's family image, but also the fact that it needs new ideas itself. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Sony (NYSE: SNE ) also should consider bidding for the privilege to publish and host more of this part of the Disney universe. Let's not stop there, though; Infinity is Infinity, and it is an important trademark that should not be totally abandoned, but there are all kinds of opportunities in this licensing arena. Disney should aggressively increase its exposure to retail shelves dedicated to gaming. Every Disney Channel show, for instance, could have a videogame version. The company's popular ABC shows could likewise see gaming treatments. It might seem like it would be too much of a good thing, but that isn't necessarily the case; making more titles, but maybe less of each of one of them so as to not flood the market, would keep the Disney logo in the eye, promote the licensed properties, and hopefully increase revenue from interactive entertainment. The key is to keep development costs low - just make simpler games that don't require a huge investment in time on the part of the player, or a high suggested retail price. A game based on Disney Channel's Girl Meets World wouldn't need to be a long-term affair on the scale of something like Call of Duty. It might sound odd to suggest making, say, a 3DS or PS4 version of Girl Meets World, but Disney has done this to similar titles in the past. That's So Raven and Phil of the Future come to mind - they were both represented on the GameBoy, as an example. Kim Possible was on both handheld platforms and PlayStation 2. Home Improvement could be found on the SuperNintendo, believe it or not. The company has a long history of licensing its stories to videogame platforms. That won't stop. Further focus should be made on expanding this business, no matter whether the industry is in contraction or expansion mode. In addition to increasing the amount of videogame product based on current Disney content, I would like to see more remakes of classic Disney titles; there were updated versions of Duck Tales, originally on the Nintendo Entertainment System, and Castle of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse, which was a Sega Genesis cartridge. There are many, many games the company could bring back for today's players; not doing so would be leaving money on the table. I would not want Disney to suddenly become a videogame company; that is not its prime mission statement. But the company's brand possesses a lot of value to licensees, and any entity that wants to publish a new Disney game or remake an older one with all the bells and whistles of current computing technology should be courted. The company should start to seriously map out a strategy of growth for this part of its empire, as I believe it can be a big generator of value for consumer products if properly planned and executed.
