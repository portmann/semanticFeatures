Ford Vs. GM: One Day Makes A Huge Difference - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I am/we are long GM. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. Ford Motor on January 12 announced a special dividend in addition to the regular dividend. GM on January 13 announced a slight increase to its quarterly dividend and a boost to its share repurchase plan. Ford Motor (NYSE: F ) after the market closed on January 12 announced a supplemental cash dividend of $0.25 along with the regular quarterly dividend of $0.15. Ford decided to return owners cash to owners. GM (NYSE: GM ) before the market opened on January 13 announced a modest increase in its quarterly dividend and an increase to its share repurchase program. GM decided to provide owners cash to those selling shares. Since January 13, has GM or Ford produced the better return for investors? Another was of viewing the price action is investor preference of where their cash should go - in their pocket or the pocket of those selling shares. The figures in the charts below do not reflect the dividends that will be earned. Using January 13 as the starting date suggests that investors prefer getting the cash, as Ford stock has declined 1.76%, while GM's stock is down 4.13%, see chart. However, using January 12 as the starting date the results are different with Ford down 6.73% and GM down 3.53%. See chart. By changing the start date by one day, the results are vastly different. So, why were the two particular dates shown, if one was seeking to suggest one method of capital allocation is better than another? Short answer, in the short-term there can be noise that clouds the data. Also, to make investors aware that one day can make a difference. Would investors prefer the known return from a cash dividend, be it a regular and or special dividend, or from a possible increase in the price of the stock? The year to date return slightly favors GM. Once the dividend ex-date and pay date come to pass then the chart results may favor Ford. GM is nearing the one-year anniversary of its share repurchase program and after spending $3.5 billion the stock is currently $29.23. That is lower than where shares were the first repurchase, at $38, and is below the November 2010 IPO price of $33 . Factoring in dividends earned, the loss on the shares are cut roughly in half, see chart. Time will tell whether Ford or GM will provide the superior return. However, GM is below its IPO price and is lower after spending $3.5 billion repurchasing shares. One might question why GM does not trust its owners with the cash it has been providing to those selling stock. On the other hand, why has Ford decided to provide a special dividend to its owners?
