Boeing's (BA) CEO Leanne Caret Presents at Deutsche Bank Global Industrials and Materials Summit (Transcript) | Seeking Alpha Great. I think we'll go ahead and get started. So welcome, this is towards the end of day one of the A&B Track. My name is Myles Walton, the Aerospace Defense Analyst here at Deutsche Bank. And with us today we're pleased to have with us Boeing. Hometown, Chicago here, and presenting for the company, Leanne Caret, who is the newly named President & CEO of Boeing Defense, Space and Security. So it's a pleasure to have you with us Leanne. Thanks so much for joining us. In terms of just setting the stage, it will be Q&A and interactive R&O -- there are R&O slides to necessarily show other than the forward-looking statement to cover everyone in the room. And so with that Leanne, thanks again for coming. Could you mainly characterize for us how you're looking at the defense spending landscape, both domestically but also with 40% of your sales internationally, how that is also looking for you? At the high how it's changed and how you think it's going to change one way or the other over the next few years? It's a really interesting environment. You're starting to see an increased demand. If you look at the U.S. government budget, roughly 2.2% over the next five years and we have a lot of folks who are pretty excited about that. I still view that as modest growth. I'm clearly bit -- we're continuing to see the effects of the geopolitical environment, watch continuously tensions in the Middle East and then the South Asia and it's driving different behaviors, both within the U.S. as well as internationally. And so from Boeing position, where we are positioned with our rotorcraft business, with our fighter business, with our services business; there is all opportunity there to continue to advance in those areas. I'm not seeing a direct impact in terms of increased backlog this year whether it was both of that. But I do think as we're not trying to stabilize our backlog as we look through the future to take advantage of that and grow the business. Okay. And from an international, vis-Ã -vis, domestic, how would you put those two in different characterizations, compare/contrast, which you're seeing in those two markets? Within BDS we're continuing to see the debate in terms of how the government wants to spend its money. Clearly as we move into new administrations, we will see also the outcome of that, I don't think any one of us can forget what that means for us. While we continue to see those from a U.S. perspective, services that have ageing aircraft, we are focused on the need to do some replacements that they have put on hold for a number of years. But even in doing so they are still facing its higher extremely tight fiscal constraints until how do they do that in a most affordable way and ensure that they have the reliability and availability they need as they continue to migrate those products and over the long haul. On the international side, what I'm continuing to see and I'm out quite a bit in a different move I've had over the past couple of decades is, a continued desire to be as aligned to the U.S. as possible. So when there are U.S. products and services that are out there, you're going to see many of these customers who want to be part of that family of products and services but in terms of the scale and the size that they can buy from a fleet perspective, it's not as significant but also they don't necessarily have all the infrastructure to be able to maintain upgrade and sustain them overtime. And so that's from a services perspective where we have an advantage to really take to look at where we have that global programs and we have that installed base, how do we bring a lot of what we've done in the U.S. to those countries to help them make certain they are as efficient as possible. And you think that the election outcome has a material impact, not domestically but on the international front as it relates to those allies and friends who want to be closer to us through buying our products. Is there positive and negatives to that? I can't -- none of us can speak to it. I just came back from Singapore that the Shangri-La Dialogue with past weekend where we were focusing on where the conversation revolves around Southeast Asia and the different environmental conditions that all the ministries of defense are facing. There are just so many different of variables playing into their decision-making process, and like the U.S. they also have some significant budgetary constraint where they are trying to balance or what they are doing from a social perspective and social programs as well as from a different perspective. There is just two specific ones on international; the Vietnam opening of the exportability of weapons and then the Canadians decision to push out at F-35 decision until the next decade opening the door to more F-18 buys in the near-term. Can you talk about those two as maybe opportunities? Vietnam, I actually had the opportunity to meet with part of the Vietnam contingency while I was in Singapore. And they are very excited about what it means to have the arms em bargo lifted but part of it's figuring out to them what does that mean. There is still going to be state department approvals and requirements that need to go through. They are also a country that has to figure out fiscally what they can afford and what they can't afford. So I do believe that there is opportunity there. In terms of the timing, I think it's going to -- we're all going to need to be patient to understand those impacts. With regards to Canada, we welcome the opportunity to put the Super up in a competition. I continue to believe it's a great aircraft with great capabilities and we'll let that customer work through its process and if they determine that, it's going to be open for competition, we'll be all-in to compete. Okay. Well, let's stay on the fighter enterprise for a second. So you have the F-15, the F-18, what is the current outlook for those two platforms in the medium-term? So in the short-term, we see demand signals that continue to indicate that we'll be producing both, the 15 and the 18 through the early 2020s. What I'm equaling if not more excited about is how we take the opportunity to modernize those existing aircrafts that are out there, both for U.S. as well as for other countries and modernize them for tomorrows fight. I mean this is all about keeping these assets, they are going to be flying into the 2040s and keeping them relevant. And relevant means addressing aging aircraft issues where they have corrosion because of the types of operations and the number of hours that they've had to fly over the past few decades and the number of conflicts they've had, as well as how are they being outfitted from an avionics perspective and from our weapons perspective. And I really try to bring focus back to a Chinook story when I talk about our fighter business because if you look at the history of the Chinook program, it went into service during the Vietnam war and by everyone, and the history books will show that it was at the near brink of being out of production how many different times over the course of the last 50 years including us late as in the early 2000 when we produced less than 10 aircraft in an entire year. Yet you look at the demand for the Chinook's today and what advantage it -- it's the focus we had on modernizing and upgrading it and continuing to evolve the technology so that we already win the next opportunity presents itself. From our fighter perspective, I think the same thing occurring not only from a service life enhancement program that addresses the corrosion, addresses aging aircraft the issues, but the modernization aspect so that when the next fighter competition is, and there will be another one at some point in the future, we have the capabilities to talent the expertise to compete. And you are prime supplier on the program when it was being produced. What is the thinking and probability, important? Okay, alright. Let's stay then still in the fixed swing markets. The trainer is an opportunity on the horizon that you're -- I'm sure going to be eagerly awaiting -- competing for C/JSTARS. Talk about those in terms of timeline and import to you. And also put it in the context and we'll get to in a minute but how you would go to bid on those contracts. I think people want you to win things but they want you to win them profitably. I think -- if don't mind Miles, it was kind of what I've shared with our team and I shared it at the Investors Conference back in May that as I look to the future of Boeing Defense, I want to make certain that we have a clarity around where we want to have a leadership role from a market position and where we want to align our investment. As you all know, we spend roughly $1 billion a year in R&D on the defense side, and we want to make certain to your point that we're spinning in a way that adds value from a company perspective to our shareholders. And those six markets are on our commercial derivative. Overall JSTARS fits well into that, that's strong [ph]. You will also hear anatomist, as one of my six focus areas and that's where it's now called MG25 has been -- has several names as of late that is official designations now fits into that space. But then you also have our rotorcraft business that talks a little bit about it and extending those lines we have human space exploration, satellites business and then our services business. And the fighter actually speaking about really sits well in that service play issue going forward. But there are several campaigns that I view as I can win in that, clearly, very much want to win, T-X is one of those, MG25, the JSTARS sweet cap, and GBSD which by itself mainly focus -- still think about droves all over others in terms of size and scale. Now that also will require the government to decide conversations running of nuclear triads versus the diad [ph] and I didn't know of that. But clearly the conversation is such as that we need some of those defensive mechanisms. When we look at how we're going to bid, I want to -- my focus is to bid to win but do in a way that is going to bring profitability to the company. We've been very clear, I think you all heard Dennis Muilenburg say it just last week, how we are targeting increasing our margins going forward. You've seen on the defense side, over the past five years we've continued to show growth in that area and we continue to do that going forward. And that's really based on [ph], first half is affordability in general, making certainly structure the business the way it was from our overheads or benefit of our facilities in a way that really gives us that advantage there. Secondly, through our productivity and efficiencies, I gave an example not too long where based on how we've been able to take lessons from commercial and pull them into our defense business, we've been able to reduce the average unit purchase price by 30% over the last five years. And then finally, it's your business models and I think that's a lot of what folks haven't talked about as much as what is an innovative business model look like, how do you add in a service elements to it that will allow you to take advantage of the tail of the acquisition because as you all know, as well as I do, when you look at a total valuable weapon system, 30% is upfront with the acquisition of the asset itself, 70% of its been on support and sustainability over the decade. And so how do we take advantage of that and those are the considerations and we'll be making in each of those campaign. Okay. And is the one that it's kind of clear that would drop into your backlog this year, the Presidential aircraft recap because the source solution has already been determined and it's just I guess the matter of T's & C's to get it under a contract? Yes, I spent 10 years of my career supporting the special air mission's slate of which the Presidents airplane is one of them. It is definitely an honor and privilege to support that aircraft. The contract structure is in line with the development type program, we are working through trade studies with the U.S. Air Force right now and we look forward to supporting that program. Yes, they are looking at -- right now they are looking to their formal process about the term of the aircraft and that's how they have made the program right now. Okay. And so to carry out those two, we've talked about bleakly but bidding things profitably, how has the bid process changed since something like the KC-46 which was a strategic investment, you kind of knew that you were skating on the edge when you bid it, most likely, maybe you didn't know you were skating over the edge but you knew you were skating on the edge. Have you changed the process, the risk hurdles and the gating process? What have you learned from the 46 process that's feeding into lessons or in for the new competitions? I'm not going to say our bid process has changed, we were very aware of the bid we made on KC-46, we're very focused on the fact that we've recognized it's a franchise program that's going to be in service for decades with 400 aircraft. Clearly, all those things that are going to generate long-term profitability for us collectively. While we're continuing to look forth to understand how we are bidding in terms of the full life cycle and so one of the areas of options that we always have, especially as we deal with defense contracts, as so many times the evaluation is focused on the instant contract and the instant price and that support piece doesn't come along with it. And so the more opportunities where we can look at holistic solutions, where we can bring both, the aircraft -- the aircraft and the vehicle I'll say, as well as the support element. That changes the conversation dramatically and I think it's a real opportunity for us. So in a sense where the KC-46 and Dennis has talked about this over the entire lifecycle, you obviously have access to the tail of that logistics and that's where the pay-off is from a total program perspective. But I'd imagine you'd still have learned some of the -- the lessons are in the system engineeringâ¦ Yes, so in terms of the execution of it, that's -- the execution of the program which isn't as much about the business case or the model, the business model. It is the U.S. Air Force's top priority, it is my top priority. I spent nearly time every day on KC-46 and it's not time sitting 2,000 miles away, calling and making questions. I am routinely in sales [ph] Monday or Friday. Again, when we're out on the floor, we're talking and making sure we understand. I grew up around airplanes, I've run shop floors before, so the ability to be out there and really see first-hand where the challenges and issues are. I think one of the key differences from when we did and started executing KC-46 to where we are today with the start-up of our development organization. And with all confidence, I believe that we're better off on tanker to-date because of the development organization effect that we established that last year and put that mechanism in place, and there has been a lot of conversation, we've seen all of the media, I know there has been a lot of debate about what was known when and where. Because of our -- the way we've organized, that is why when we made the decision after tests that the software solution wouldn't work that we could pivot instantly to a hardware solution because from a development organization perspective, we were operating down two paths. We didn't spend a lot of time talking about the two paths, but it allowed us to be proactive and our customer was with us every step of the way to make sure that they understood that as well. So as external investors we see there is a few milestones that moved on the 46 to stay on it for a second. One was the milestone C's, it goes to August, the other is the delivery of equipped aircraft, and the third is the RAA formal contractual piece. And so as external investors, we're trying to calculate and understand what the implications are financially of all that. If I think about those three pieces, is the biggest piece solving implementing the hardware fix in the near-term in a two-month period of time? So getting their hardware fixed, tested; so again, we still have 80% of flight tests still to do and we've been clear on that. We will be flying the aircraft in the July timeframe, again, our -- what we have remaining to do to prove out the boom is flying the 17, flying the F-16, and then flying the A-10. We'll give that data -- the Air Force will actually conduct those tests with us and then they'll do the data and then I'll prepare us for milestone C and the decision to go into production, you know how that production configuration defined. From a financial impact, we are in the process of assessing what those impacts are, implementing that solution, as well as -- and we've shared before, change in corporation because we are going to have beyond 18 aircraft built next summer and we're going to do not only the change in corporation we've always talked about but the modifications to the boom that will need to be done. Now it's not rebuilding an entire boom but there will be modifications required to the boom. And so that will be incorporated as part of that. We've also talked from a cash perspective, we're not looking at cash to be impacted this year. The timing supports the decision, supports the timing based on what we know today, but we do need to complete our financial assessment. Got it. Okay. I think Dennis also said that linear growth from the cash flow this year to next year is also not derailed by this? And so talk about the depth of business that has actually grown through sequestration, its performance has been as if sequestration didn't exist and the down cycleâ¦ So talk about the trajectory and the ability of that momentum to continue, both on a top line and from a margin perspective? It is -- I'm real passionate about the services business and it goes back to that point of conversation that when you look at the lifecycle of a weapons system, 30% of the cost is associated with the initial purchase of the aircraft or the vehicle. And most times, more attention is spent on that than is spent on the whole tail end of it. Many years back, we made the decision to stand up a separate services business focusing on customer understanding and customer intimacy in terms of how do we give them the best access, the best availability, and the best support that they need in order to maintain a fleet, especially recognizing that operational and support budgets always are under pressure. And so when we look at what we've been able to achieve, we've been successful not only taking advantage of the installed presence we have around the globe from a just pure-play Boeing, but we've also been able to move off Boeing platforms into other areas where we can apply these same techniques, whether itâs modernizing and upgrading or its providing parts support or some sort of predictive data management set that allows us to help our customers manage their fleets. And that's really what allowed us to grow that business, and you've seen that specifically as we set up Boeing Defense Australia, Boeing Defense UK, Saudi Arabia and then, as we go forward, in India. On the side, we also have the opportunity with those business models because these are customers who don't have necessarily all that infrastructure and so we have the ability to get truly paid for performance based on terms that we've set up and when we perform better than those stated goals, we can get some upside out of that, and that's been great. Well, that's an area that seems like a perennial upside. So I think it's six years in a row you've beat your initial margin guidance in GSS by 150 basis points on average? And you look like you're tracking ahead again this year. So what is it that won't prevent this year from looking like the last six years in terms of this being kind of an offsetting function to some of the risks, retirements, and the otherâ¦ I'm not going to -- obviously, I'm not going to talk forward-looking guidance, that wouldn't be appropriate. What I would say is if this continues to be a business where we can be innovative, not only in our business models but we really have been extremely aggressive in our costs, on our affordability initiative. And we continue to see really, just great performance out of this area of the business. So the affordability initiative last year, the business talked about $5.1 billion of cost savings achieved with another $1 billion to go within the GDS, the defense, space and security business. How much progress are you making towards that $1 billion of incremental savings? We actually achieved $6 billion on savings over the last five years, so we have surpassed all of our expectations on market-based affordability. I mean -- and for those of you all who've been following, that's a combination of what we've done on partnering for success in terms of taking advantage and coming up with win-wins with our supply base. In addition to that, it's really have been about optimizing the workforce, optimizing our benefit packages. And in the services side, that's an area where customers can't afford to pay high-end engineering and development rates. You're looking at a certain service level, and so we are able to tailor those mixes to that customer segment. I've been extremely aggressive; part of these dates back to my time as CFO, we've had great success to-date. My belief is that we can continue to push forward those affordability efforts and there is more to be gained, and we'll continue to do so. So to put your business in context of the whole Boeing thesis as a stock, right now a big piece of that thesis is tied to cash flow. And the cash flow of the entire company -- obviously, Boeing Defense is a big contributor to it. If you look at your cash contribution, your business's cash contribution, the last few years and the next few years, is that a stable contributor and how would you classify its cash conversion versus the rest of the business? We convert cash to earnings pretty consistently, and we have -- so as you look at our earnings projections, that gives you a good leading indicator on our cash. Clearly, as the C-17 line has ended well, we have one aircraft that would look at delivery next year that has -- clearly there has been some -- some of the cash has come from there, and we'll see some adjustments there but at the same time we'll see the KC-46 program ramping up. So I don't see a fundamentally different profile going forward, we'll still convert pretty much one for one with earnings. And -- so I think we're pretty consistent. Man space, so or human space -- my wife would kill me. [Cross Talk]. So ULA, do you all fear that the Space-X is going to take over the world? And ULA is obviously not a big piece of your earnings stream, but space, in general is an area that you could do a lot more. And you obviously have the presence on SLS, you have the presence on our commercial crew, and you have obviously a stake in ULA and its future as it relates to the bulk, and what happens there. Talk about that in its totality with particular emphasis, I think, on where it makes most important to you, which I imagine is in the SLS and commercial crew. My folks actually met at the Michoud plant in New Orleans, Louisiana, on the satellite program, and I was actually -- I grew up -- born down in Florida at the Kenney Space Center. And I was actually at Kennedy Space Center yesterday with the commercial crew program. Space, it is such an inspirational topic and what's really most exciting is that we're actually talking about it again, because for a number of years, you haven't heard a lot about it. It's a challenging area because you have on one hand, the requirements and the absolute no-fail mission where you're going to provide safe, reliable access that is assured with an emphasis on safe. At the same time, it is an expensive proposition, so how do you break -- I'll use one of the popular phrases of the day; how do you break the cost curve to do it in a way that totally disrupts and transforms that business? We're on a journey together, I think Space-X is right in the middle of that with us, we're all looking for how we do it and we all bring something a little bit different to the game. I think they are doing a great job in terms of how they are looking at it from a cost perspective. I think we're doing a great job in terms of how do we continue to ensure its assured and it's safe. And so it's that reconciliation and that migration of those two elements. I think what I'm most excited about is it does present a lot of opportunities for us and the U.S. as well as the rest of the world's going to decide how much funding they're going to actually put aside because it continues to be a fight year-after-year as you know. Also it isn't -- so the spending lines are just secured and nobody's going after them, they usually see some impacts and there is plus back to restore them. And so that always makes it challenging. But we, the Boeing Company, have to continue to disrupt ourselves in terms of how we're going to provide that no-fail element of it and do it in a remarkably affordable way. And we're working our way through that. You're going to ask me for a new number. I don't have a number off the top of my head. And the gentlemen standing at the back end now [ph]. Yes, I mean we're not talking double digit growth rate. And again, I think a lot of that is as a result of how it's being funded. I think there is some general conversations about is this going to end up becoming more of a commercial play as it goes forward, more so than a traditional NASA play. Yes, that is my -- not only my desire, my intent, and that we do it the right way. And sometimes doing it the right way means you need to go slow to go fast. And so making certain that we've taken our lessons learned and we've put commercial crew within our development organization and really make certain that we're doing the holistic systems engineering, to your earlier point up front, and make sure that we can deliver on that commitment. Okay. And then the ULA, and your role as a J's partner, and what you think are the future there, what your commitment is, what your requirements are for the Vulcan? And then new launch where that would be required to compete? We're all -- there is -- I don't know of anybody that's not interested in having a U.S. rocket. The discussion around the use of Russian rockets â everybody is aligned, the problem is we don't have a U.S. rocket right now of the right size that makes it the most affordable and economical for our nation. And so giving us the time to bridge to that continues to be part of the conversation that's had. And aside to that is how do you -- how does ULA become cost-effective from a price per launch? And that is something that team is totally focused on and we've been seeing great progress on that to-date. And they've read the tea leaves, they understand what's needed, and they're going after it full court. And from a CapEx requirements from or development dollars required from Boeing to inject into the joint venture, is that something that will show up on the radar? And the $900 million a year that you do spend in R&D across the business; what's the trajectory of that? Is it a flat outlook relative to flat sales? Pretty stable. Even through -- even during the downturn, if you look -- we're a $30 billion company, we have been for a period of time, we have never shied away from our investment dollars. I think it's one of the reasons why we've been able to stay the course through some fairly challenging times from budge perspective. We're going to -- we don't have any intentions of changing that course significantly going forward. Okay. And maybe the last line would be around the programs in the rotorcraft market that are mature, seeming like they kind of run like clockwork, another business that you ran? So think, tell -- help us think about what the outlook is for rotorcraft. Is that a stable piece of the business? Yes, one of the things I learned running that business is -- and around the world, to the U.S. we look to our fighters and our bombers as being the iconic aircraft that our military uses. If you look at the UK, if you look at other nations, the Rotorcraft, the Chinook fleet, for instance, is their iconic asset of choice. And as the conflicts continue, whether it's in the Middle East, whether it's in the -- whatever happens in the Asia Pacific, you're going to still continue to find that need for that type of capability. And I really like to share a story as well because I think it talks a little about me as a leader, and why what we do is so important. I received a phone call one day at the office a few years back from my mother, it was really odd because not many of us get phone calls from moms at work. And she called to thank us for building the Chinook. And I asked during the course of the conversation, why the call, because it's a bit out of the ordinary. And she said, my son was a ground troop and he was involved in an IED incident and the majority of his team was killed, he was critically wounded, and a Chinook got him out and then he got into a field hospital and then eventually he came home to Walter Reed on a C-17. And it's not a plug per se for the Chinook or the C-17 but she said, he came home for Christmas because of what you all do. And that's part of as part of this defense space and what we do is our contribution to the fight is really not determined purely by our proximity to the fight, we do meaningful work. The assets we're building, the assets that we're supporting provide value to the war fighters and to all of us that are sitting here in this room today. And so I think the rotorcraft fleet will continue to show its dominance because of that very need. Okay. Well, I'm not going to top the story of the mother calling about her son, so I think we'll probably come to a conclusion there, at this time. Well, thank you for the time. I appreciate it. I think you caused me to lose my voice. Thank you very much. Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.
