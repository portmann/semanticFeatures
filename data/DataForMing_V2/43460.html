How Much Is Yahoo Really Worth? - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha Yahoo has multiple assets that are currently worth more than the market is willing to pay for the stock. The company's Alibaba stake alone is worth 75% of Yahoo's market cap. Essentially, investors now have the opportunity to purchase Yahoo's core business for less than zero. Ever since the Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) IPO, I have heard talk that Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) is severely undervalued. These conversations haven't been whispers either. They have been shouts that have echoed through the market. However, the stock appears to have run out of steam as of late despite backing from the analyst community. Now, after hearing the phrase "Yahoo is grossly undervalued" for the thousand-and-somethingth time, I finally decided to try to identify just how much the parts are worth on my own and see if there was still more upside in this somewhat tired name. Yahoo's remaining 384 million shares of Alibaba, currently valued at $32 BB. Yahoo's 35.5% equity interest in Yahoo Japan, worth approximately $8.52 BB. Yahoo's remaining 384 MM share stake in Alibaba is the first thing that comes to investors' minds when they look at the company's value unlocking potential. And it should be, after all the stake is currently worth $32 BB, and represents over 75% of Yahoo's total market cap. On January 27th, Yahoo announced plans to realize the value in the stake through a tax-free spinoff sometime in the fourth quarter. Even though there will be one legacy business tied up in the newly formed SpinCo, it is assumed that the new company will act as a tracking stock. For that reason, it is only prudent that we at least familiarize ourselves with Alibaba's valuation. Currently, Alibaba trades at 38.7x this year's earnings estimates and 30.3x 2016 estimates. These multiples may seem expensive at first glance, but when comparing them to the company's anticipated 28% growth rate, they don't seem so stretched. In fact, I believe in the right market, investors would be willing to pay up to 40x 2016 numbers or $112 per share for the stock. This was evidenced by the stock's earlier post IPO push to $120. On the other hand, the stock also could trade down on a bad tape. In this case, given the superior growth, BABA should see buyers support the stock around the company's growth rate. Being cautionary, let's say they arrive a tad late, at 25x 2016 numbers. In my bullish case, the BABA stake could be worth up to $45.37 per share. Meanwhile, the bearish valuation presents only $28.35 in value and the base case, as you can imagine, splits the difference at $34.39 per share. The Yahoo Japan stake is a bit harder to value because it trades on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, meaning it trades in yen. This implies a bit of currency risk for Yahoo. Currently, this stake is worth just over $8.52 BB or about $9 per share. However, this same stake (at Yahoo Japan's current stock price) would have been worth considerably more a year ago, about $9.95 BB. The declining value is due in large part to the depreciation of the yen relative to the US dollar. Therefore, the value of this stake presents a significant amount of currency risk, especially at a time when a US rate hike appears to be just around the corner. If the dollar continues to strengthen, the value of Yahoo Japan in USD would likely proceed to drift lower. Along with the implied volatility of forex markets, Yahoo's partner on the venture, SOFTBANK ( OTCPK:SFTBY ), is reportedly uninterested in upping their already sizeable stake. Given the size of the investment, it may be a tough sell to any individual company. For this reason, I believe realizing the full $8.52 BB value of Yahoo Japan is not as feasible as many think. Additionally, any sale of this business will most likely see some sort of taxation, unless Marissa Mayer can work another tax-free miracle comparable to what she appears to be pulling off with the BABA SpinCo. With that said, it's hard to image that Mayer will be able to realize the full current value of the company's Yahoo Japan stake. For this reason, I think a discount has to be applied to account for risks discussed above. Assuming a 25% discount, which is more than fair in my opinion, the stake is worth about $6.4 BB, or $6.74 per share. It's no secret that Yahoo's core business is no longer accelerating, with portions of the business evidently declining, most notably in legacy businesses. This can be seen in almost all areas of PC advertising, as premium ads declined 40% year-over-year in contribution to an overall quarter-over-quarter PC advertising revenue decline of $100 MM in the first quarter. However, these declines have been somewhat offset by growth in MVNS (Mobile, Video, Native and Social). Mobile revenue was up 61%, while the MVNS segment as a whole grew 58% to a record $363 MM. The hope is that this segment will continue to offset any continued declines in the PC space as it has thus far. Overall, revenue continued to increase the latest quarter, advancing 8%. Meanwhile ex-TAC revenue declined 3% due in large part to some one-time items. The core business also has some interesting digital content that's capable of producing steady annual cash flows. With 13 new digital magazines, a 16-year-old fantasy sports franchise and social media site Tumblr, Yahoo anticipates full-year 2015 adjusted EBITDA to total between $240 MM and $260 MM. Tech companies typically trade at some sort of multiple to their EBITDA (albeit they can be vastly different). This can be seen by looking at two other internet names. The first, Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), has been managed superbly and is considered by many to be the premier player in the space. Therefore, its EBITDA demands a multiple that's higher than its peers, currently 17x. On the opposite end of the spectrum there is AOL (NYSE: AOL ), which has been unable to keep up with much of the shifts that have taken place in the industry. Because of this, it trades at a more depressed multiple of 7.5x EBITDA. With that in mind, I think it would be fair to value Yahoo's business somewhere in the middle at around 10x EBITDA. At 10x, Yahoo's core business would be worth $2.5 BB, or $2.64 per share. Another thing to keep in mind is that Tumblr alone cost $1.1 BB a few years back. Add to that the company's other acquisitions under Mayer, and the M&A activity alone totals $2.1 BB. This should put somewhat of a floor on what investors are willing to pay for the core business. However, one could argue that they overpaid for some of these businesses. In addition to the three parts that currently comprise Yahoo, the company also has a cash buffer. Looking at the balance sheet, there's $6.9 BB in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. All of this could easily be converted into cash. Turning to liabilities, Yahoo owes $1.3 BB in convertible and other debt. Backing out the debt, the company's net cash position comes to $5.6 BB, or $5.91 per share. Summing up the parts of Yahoo is fairly easy at their current market prices. The Alibaba stake is worth $32.6 BB. Then add to that the Yahoo Japan stake (valued at $8.52 BB) and the company's net cash position ($5.6 BB). The sum of these three assets total $46.72 BB. When compared to the company's current market cap, this implies that Yahoo's core business is worth negative $4.686 BB. However, it is impossible to value a company with positive cash flows at below zero. Therefore the discrepancy between the real value of Yahoo's parts and that implied by the current market price of the stock may be even larger. On the other hand, there's a risk that Yahoo cannot realize all of the value of its Yahoo Japan stake or shares of Alibaba may trade lower. Accounting for these fluctuations, I composed the chart that's presented below. It summarizes what I believe Yahoo would be worth in three different states of the world. Given my analysis, I believe that there is substantial value in Yahoo that will be realized in the coming 12 months. I also believe the risk-reward sets up nicely at the stock's current price. With that said, I recommend starting a position in Yahoo immediately and using any future dip below $41 to accumulate more shares. Source: How Much Is Yahoo Really Worth?
