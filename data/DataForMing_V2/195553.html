Click to print (Opens in new window) At long last, Facebook has removed the veil from its highly anticipated “Dislike” button — only it’s not quite that simple. The social network revealed a set of six emojis to go along with the traditional thumbs-up: a heart for â€œlove,â€? then emoticons for â€œHaha,â€? â€œYay,â€? â€œWow,â€? â€œSadâ€? and â€œAngry.â€? According to TechCrunch , the pop-up feature will start out as a test in only Spain and Ireland before Facebook makes the final decision on whether the new buttons should be launched elsewhere. The move is in line with comments head cheese Mark Zuckerberg made in the past that there needed to be a way to express an emotion other than liking something, though he never called it a “dislike” button. â€œI do think itâ€™s important to give people more options than just like,â€? he said last month, according to the New York Times. The emoji reactions will be available on both mobile and desktop versions of the Facebook app and on posts the News Feed, and apply to friends’ statuses as well as pages, accounts and advertisers. â€œPeople come to Facebook to share all kinds of things â€”  whether thatâ€™s updates that are happy, sad, funny or thought-provoking,â€? a Facebook spokesperson told VentureBeat . â€œAnd weâ€™ve heard youâ€™d like more ways to celebrate, commiserate or laugh together. Thatâ€™s why we are testing Reactions, an extension of the Like button, to give you more ways to share your reaction to a Facebook post in a quick and easy way.â€?
