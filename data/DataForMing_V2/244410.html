Apple Investors Should Be More Cautious, Foxconn Data A False Positive - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Investors should not rely on Foxconn's data to deduce strengthening iPhone sales. It's more likely that Foxconn's October revenue grew as a result of higher component costs, which impact FXCOF positively, as it records revenue on a gross basis rather than net. Furthermore, it seems analysts are resistant to the notion that iPhone ASPs could drop, but given the unit composition of prior-generation handsets, ASPs will likely deteriorate. The launch of a 4-inch variation further weakens assumptions on ASPs. I don't anticipate the cheaper iPhone to create enough volume to offset the weakness in pricing/margins. Given the weak backdrop of business fundamentals, I anticipate the valuation to deteriorate even further in line with historical value-metric trends. As such, my cautious stance on Apple is justifiable. I've received a lot of criticism for my Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) articles recently, but given the increasing likelihood that the company could potentially miss on sales and earnings in the next quarter, I feel that it's necessary to write this article. Furthermore, my stance on Apple and Foxconn ( OTC:FXCOF ) contradicts what Seeking Alpha contributor Mark Hibben published earlier this week. As you are all aware, Foxconn reported sales growth of 7.24% year over year in the month of October. However, I don't think that's purely attributable to unit growth, so it cannot be used to support a bullish argument for AAPL's upcoming quarter. In other words, given the increasing cost of components for the iPhone 6s/6s Plus when compared to the cost of iPhone 6/6 Plus, Foxconn most likely reported revenue growth as a result of component costs increasing. However, this doesn't necessary translate to Apple's top line, because AAPL's pricing remained relatively stable from prior year in the holiday quarter. Well, according to Foxconn, its revenue recognition is based on the purchase of components and the sale of final goods to third-party OEMs, which it refers to as 3C products: The Group manufactures and sells 3C products. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, taking into account value-added tax, returns, rebates and discounts for the sale of goods to external customers in the ordinary course of the Group's activities. Revenue arising from the sales of goods should be recognized when the Group has delivered the goods to the customer, the amount of sales revenue can be measured reliably and it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity. Foxconn recognizes revenue on a gross basis rather than net. So the revenue recognition of an iPhone handset isn't based on assembly cost, but rather the total cost of manufacturing an iPhone, which is inclusive of components and assembly. Where the Group acts as an agent, net revenue is recognized representing commission earned. The Group provides integrated electronics manufacturing services to meet the following criteria by judgment and recognizes revenue on a gross basis: a. The Group has primary responsibilities for the goods or services it provides; b. The Group bears inventory risk; c. The Group bears credit risk of customers. The reason Foxconn is able to report its revenues on gross is due to generally accepted accounting principles. A manufacturer can report gross revenue assuming they take on responsibility for delivery of the goods, carry inventory, and offer short-term financing (net 30, net 60). Foxconn's revenue growth is primarily attributable to the increase in bill of materials from prior year rather than an increase in total units sold. We know this based on data from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Since, we're working off of net revenue, we can assume that Foxconn's bill of materials increased from $205.80 to $234 from the prior year. Therefore, Foxconn's revenue growth was partially driven by a 13.72% increase in its gross revenue per iPhone unit. Of course, the margins on manufacturing iPhone are extremely small, but the incremental impact from higher component costs is reflected in Foxconn's unaudited revenue figures for the month of October. It's also worth noting that Apple is Foxconn's biggest customer, and as such, it's estimated that 40% to 50% of Foxconn's revenue is derived from the Apple handset manufacturing. The reason Foxconn's revenue growth didn't increase even more in response to higher iPhone costs is due to the drop-off in ASPs for lower-end handsets in general. Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) reported that its handset ASPs declined from $225 to $202 between FY 2015 and FY 2014. As such, Foxconn's strength in iPhone BoMs is offset by falling Android handset costs. Therefore, Foxconn's 7.24% year-over-year revenue growth isn't necessarily driven by Apple handset volumes, but rather an increase in cost inputs. However, iPhone handset pricing won't offset the incremental increase in manufacturing and component costs, which implies gross margin deterioration. I also want to explore the possibility that Apple's iPhone volumes will report either in line or below consensus estimates. Apple reported 74.45 million iPhone units in Q1'FY15, however, the consensus estimate for iPhone units have declined considerably as we progressed throughout the quarter. And while I don't have an established relationship with every Wall Street investment bank, the trajectory has been weak as Steven Milunovich over at UBS AG lowered estimates earlier this week. Of course, other analysts at Credit Suisse have alerted their banking clients of order cuts, which point to a weak Q1' and Q2'FY16. In a research report earlier this week, UBS also confirms the weakness in orders, but is also uncertain on the degree to which it will impact sales and earnings for AAPL's upcoming quarter: UBS analyst Arthur Hsieh indicates Hon Hai's 4Q iPhone assembly order forecast has been cut and should be down 10% YoY. Earlier there was a 10-15% downward order adjustment to the force touch supply chain companies to correct for an overbuild to mitigate anticipated low yield rates. We are unclear what this order pullback means for iPhone shipments. Of course it is not encouraging, but the 4Q build rate had been quite high, so unit demand could still be decent. We are lowering our March iPhone unit estimate from 62.5 to 61mn. Our F16 iPhone estimate now calls for 4%-unit growth, including 5% growth in Dec, a flat March, and mid-single digit growth in the second half of F16. There could be a new 4-inch phone, worth perhaps 10mn units. Needless to say, analysts are revising estimates lower, however, in the case of UBS, perhaps its estimate is a little too optimistic? After reviewing its financial model, it forecast ASPs of $676 for Q1'FY16 in comparison to Apple's FY2015 ASP of $670.54. Perhaps it is too aggressive on ASPs, as Apple's unit composition has a higher blend of prior-generation models in the upcoming fiscal year. Furthermore, what uniquely differentiated supply chain data was the composition mix of iPhone 6 casing in comparison to iPhone 6s casing, which directly correlates to the lower average selling prices, because the prior-generation model is sold at a price point that's $100 cheaper than the current generation base model. In other words, if Credit Suisse is right that 53 million units of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus is sold in FY 2016, it would be fair to assume that pricing would drop to $653. However, even Credit Suisse admits that it has not included the impact of a 4-inch iPhone that's sold at an ASP of $400 to $500. Therefore, if we include the impact from a smaller iPhone and the demand for older-generation iPhones, ASPs will likely drop below $640. I see no reason to anticipate that the pricing reduction will result in enough demand to offset margin pressure, as the 4-inch variation will be released outside of the holiday season when demand for handsets is the weakest. I anticipate that a smaller handset will result in the cannibalization of demand for higher-priced handsets, as consumer electronics have high price elasticity. Demand will likely shift to lower-end handsets, which will displace sales, and likely result in lower profitability on a consolidated basis. Of course, I'm operating off of a conventional economic logic, but nonetheless there's no denying the inverse relationship between economic profits and price levels. The lower the price level, the less economically profitable any good or service can be, and in the case of a 4-inch variation, the incremental demand won't offset the lost economic profit, based on how sensitive consumers are to pricing. As such, I can't imagine how Apple will mitigate the drop-off in pricing with unit volumes, or how lower pricing is incrementally positive to net income. In economics, there's no such thing as free lunch. In exchange for selling a cheaper iPhone, Apple will likely report weaker margins. There's no logical way around that fact, and furthermore, the recent data from Foxconn isn't indicative of strengthening iPhone sales. Therefore, it would be fair to assume units come in around 75 million in Q1'FY16, but I'm prepared to anticipate unit sales even weaker than the current consensus estimate. "In Mr. Cho's article, he gave Apple a 13X multiple on his EPS forecast, a price target of $116.34. My forecast calls for higher revenues and earnings, so I think a higher number, say 13.5X, is completely justified. That gives me a price target of $131.30, which is below the Street average but quite reasonable in my opinion. My valuation implies that Apple's multiple expands by about two points." Over the past year, Apple's valuation has contracted both in terms of EV/Sales and EV/EBITDA. So, on what basis does Bill anticipate multiple expansion? He believes that the earnings multiple will expand, just because it's undervalued. But given the consistency in which the valuation deteriorated over the past year and the lack of observable strength in fundamentals, I can't find a legitimate reason to anticipate earnings multiple expansion. Usually, investors bid up a stock in anticipation of strengthening fundamentals, and sell a stock in anticipation of weakening financial results. I anticipate more of the latter than the former. Therefore, I think investors would be much better positioned to buy the stock after a weak Q1 than speculate rampantly on a quarterly beat. Sure, there's no denying the consistency in Apple's quarterly beats, but given what we know, the possibility of a quarterly miss is heightened when compared to prior years. As such, investors should be more strategic when owning Apple. Perhaps hedge, limit exposure, or wait for a better opportunity to own Apple. There's no reason to accumulate a position ahead of a very speculative quarter, as Apple could miss earnings and sales expectations for the first time in quite a while. Therefore, I continue to reiterate my hold recommendation and $116.34 price target. Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
