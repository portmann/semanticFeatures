A Peek At Pioneer Natural Resources In The Downturn - Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) | Seeking Alpha PXD operates in some of the best shale basins in the U.S. and has continuously grown on a per share basis. PXD is making large investments in its Permian infrastructure which differs from its mid-cap peers. PXD made it to Goldman's 'Top 7 U.S. Shale Oil Buyout Targets'. Throughout the shale boom Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE: PXD ) has been at the forefront of great acreage captures and outstanding operational execution, while maintaining an investment grade balance sheet. Since crude and NGL's broke down towards the end of last year PXD has taken a nose dive and the stock is down 17.91% YTD and 47% since its peak in June of 2014. Still, the company has some positive momentum as it sees outstanding results from its Permian and Eagle Ford operations. According to the most recent press release found here PXD is producing 197 mboed. The production is broken down into 101 mbod, 37 m barrels NGL's/day and gas sales averaged 356 mmcf/day. In the same press release PXD said they have ~90% of oil production hedged around $70/bbl for 2015 and 93,000 bbls/day in three way collars ($77.66\$67.48\$47.39) for 2016 oil production. Gas is also around 90% hedged for 2015 at favorable prices and partially for 2016. In the last month the company just sold its Eagle Ford Shale Midstream unit with its JV partner, Reliance Industries (out of India); with the bulk of these funds being directed towards Permian operations and to further strengthen the company's balance sheet. PXD considers its Permian Basin position as a very valuable asset and the engine for future growth and NAV creation. Let's take a look what actions the company is making in order to maximize shareholder value and what the company may do with its EFS assets. The Spraberry/Wolfcamp area is the largest contributor to Pioneer's production, comprising around ~75% of the company's total oil production and 28% of the company's total natural gas production. The Eagle Ford has more of a gassy-liquids profile but still makes up around 18% of total oil production for the company. The Raton, West Panhandle and South Texas gas assets are non-core, cash flow positive (as of 2014) and could be sold off if needed. The other assets are mixed but the bottom line is that PXD is producing 101 M barrels of oil a day (51% of total production) as of its July 22 press release and spending for 2015-2016 is going towards its oily Permian assets. Currently, the company operates 6 horizontal rigs in the northern portion of its Permian acreage and 4 horizontal rigs in its southern Permian JV area. The company announced last month in its Investor Presentation that it would be adding 2 rigs per month to its northern Permian acreage from July of this year until Q1 of 2016, bringing the total rig count for its northern acreage to 24 rigs- assuming crude prices don't continue their dive. The plan to add more rigs is something that should be given attention to when the company announces Q2 earnings on August 4th. Although PXD doesn't call their northern acreage position core, it can safely be assumed it is a core position given the amount of capital and the outstanding well results going to and coming from the play. Out of a total capex budget of $1,950 mm, the northern acreage will receive $1,400 mm in capital this year with $1,004 mm for D&C. This compares to the $120 mm (net of carry) for the Southern Wolfcamp JV and $390 mm for the Eagle Ford. Total production from the Spraberry/Wolfcamp play is currently ~119 mboed (67% oil). The northern acreage competes with mid-cap companies that seem to be faring better than the greater E&P market during this downturn, such as Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ: FANG ), RSP Permian (NYSE: RSPP ) and Parsley Energy (NYSE: PE ). These companies have been drilling rock similar to that of PXD but some are focusing on the Spraberry, with excellent results. This year, PXD plans on drilling 80% Wolfcamp B (WC B) out of its 95-100 well program in the northern acreage, with the other 20% going towards WC A and Lower Spraberry Shale ( LSS ). PXD has had excellent results from its WC A/B program, as evidenced by the slide below. According to the press release from July 22 the company said they connected 28 wells in the northern acreage and 27 wells in the southern portion in Q2, noting "The majority of the horizontal wells drilled across PXD's northern acreage position were Wolfcamp B interval wells. The average production from these wells is tracking estimated ultimate recoveries (Pending: EURS ) of more than 1 million barrels oil equivalent (MMBOE)." It should be noted that PXD reported its five most recent Lower Spraberry wells are also tracking a 1 MMBOE EUR curve. PXD is not the only company to see 1 MMBOE+ EUR's. Its Permian mid-cap peers which were alluded to earlier: Diamondback Energy, Parsley Energy, RSP Permian, and others are also having success in the Wolfcamp/Spraberry zones. (Source: Diamondback Energy June Investor Presentation ) Another interesting bit of information the company has given us in their June Investor Presentation is the announcement of a large infrastructure investment in the Permian valued around $460 mm for 2015. This investment in infrastructure seems to be a wise decision given the current market prices for crude, NGL's and natural gas. It also represents PXD's desire and practice to vertically integrate its operations as much as possible. If the Eagle Ford Midstream investment is any signal of what is to come from this large Permian investment, the company can expect higher realized prices, take-away assets, more efficient operations and less interruptions from third-party gas processing and water disposal operators. The $460 mm infrastructure investment is $70 mm more than the company is investing for all operations in the Eagle Ford for 2015. Lastly, it appears the company was able to build value from its EFS Midstream sale and the same may happen with the Permian infrastructure investment. PXD also has a premier position in the Eagle Ford Shale with its JV partner, Reliance Industries. The company is giving less capital and attention to its Eagle Ford assets this year, which the company announced in their June presentation as having "before-tax IRR's up to 70% at current strip prices (average oil price of $55 per barrel during 2015)." Reliance may sound familiar as it is the same company that JV'ed with PXD on the Eagle Ford Shale Midstream business which was sold last month to Enterprise (NYSE: EPD ). With only $390 mm of the company's 2015 capital being allocated to the Eagle Ford it is clear the Permian assets are more attractive and have more room to run. Also, it is important to note that with the sale of the EFS Midstream business Pioneer estimates it will lose $100 million of cash flow, or an increase of $3/boe in production costs in its Eagle Ford operations. The capital going to the Eagle Ford this year is expected to keep production flat with the possibility of minimal growth. The Eagle Ford assets could be sold off if PXD wanted to put more capital into its Permian program and further strengthen its balance sheet, but that is not necessary and why break something that isn't broken. As noted in the June Investor Presentation, PXD is spending $460 mm on its Spraberry/Wolfcamp infrastructure. This indicates -to me at least- that the company's Permian operations will be ready for development mode and the company must think the money is better spent in the Permian in its long-term outlook. The large infrastructure investment in the Permian instead of more D&C capital towards the liquids and gas rich Eagle Ford could also just simply be part of the company's desire to become more oily. The company currently produces approximately 46 mboed (oil production around 19,000 bod) in the Eagle Ford. PXD's balance sheet is in good shape with a debt-to-capitalization ratio around 20%, an undrawn credit facility of $1,500 MM, $326 mm in cash, and an expected $725 mm pre-tax gain to be recognized in Q3 2015 upon closing the Midstream sale. The company carries an investment grade rating. According to the June Investor Presentation PXD is expecting operating cash flow of $1,600 mm this year, so outspend from the $1,950 mm capex program will be funded from cash on hand and proceeds from the Midstream sale or credit facility. PXD is expecting greater than 10% total production growth from this year's capital program, with the Permian assets predicted to grow at more than 20%. This outspend is being internally funded by cash on hand and funds from the EFS Midstream sale. This leaves PXD with a little cash to spend. In my opinion PXD will have the opportunity to bolt on assets in its 'core' area or redeem outstanding notes of $455 mm, $485 mm and $450 mm that are due in 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. Depending on market prices for crude, NGL's and natural gas, 2016 spending will probably be in line with operating cash flow in order to safeguard the balance sheet. Another thing to keep in mind is that Pioneer appears to be an excellent JV partner given its JV's with Reliance Industries in the EFS and Sinochem in the southern Wolfcamp (Permian) play, so if needed, the company could find a JV partner to help fund its operations. The company estimates there may be as much as 11 BBOE resource potential and 20,000 drilling locations in the stacked pay intervals of its Permian acreage. This leaves a lot of room for growth and explains a relatively higher EV/1P multiple. On a comparative basis PXD trades at 7.35x EV/EBITDA (ttm for all), compared to 3.6x for Devon, 2.62x for Chesapeake, 5.55x for Continental and 6.6x for EOG. This makes PXD one of the more expensive companies, but again, it is expecting good production growth and is able to access capital at a cheaper rate than some of its cheaper peers. (Data is from Yahoo Finance ) When compared on a flowing barrel comparison PXD sticks out with a measure of $108m/boed. Devon, Chesapeake, Continental, and EOG have varying levels of: $47m/boed, $27m/boed, $99m/boed, and $90m/boed, respectively (calculated on my own). The larger value for PXD isn't a huge surprise as the company is expecting 10%+ growth for 2015 and is already trading at higher multiples than its peers on other variables- which always leaves the risk of further selling if crude continues to dive. Pioneer has a book Price/Book ratio (mrq) of 2.28 compared to 1.16 for Devon (NYSE: DVN ), .59 for Chesapeake (NYSE: CHK ), 2.67 for Continental Resources (NYSE: CLR ), and 2.47 EOG Resources (NYSE: EOG ). PXD has the ability to substantially increase its reserves in the Permian as it continues to de-risk additional zones and drill new areas. The company is making smart long-term decisions and investing in infrastructure at a time when commodity prices are low- allowing it to breakout drilling when prices rise. I believe it is important to keep an eye on earnings from the mid-cap companies such as Parsley Energy, Diamondback Energy, and RSP Permian. These Permian pure-plays are concentrated in the area PXD is making large investments in and they can act as a barometer of price realizations, take-away options and general the health of the basin. If prices continue to average below $60 a barrel, I believe the company will slow its capital spending in 2016 to better match operating cash flow. If prices do average below $60 a barrel for the rest of the year the stock will have trouble finding buyers and might continue its slide. Concerning the big picture, it is also useful to keep an eye on the majors and where they're buying shale reserves. "The report ( Goldman report ) indicates that global oil majors own just 5 percent of total U.S. shale oil resources. Goldman believes that shale production has the potential to double by 2025. Brooker argues that it is likely that majors will take this opportunity to increase their exposure to U.S. shale at historically low prices." In the same report Goldman estimates the majors have around $150 billion in firepower for M&A as the industry consolidates. Goldman put PXD in its Top 7 U.S. Shale Oil Buyout Targets along with EOG Resources , Continental Resources , Cabot Oil and Gas (NYSE: COG ), Noble Energy (NYSE: NBL ), Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE: APC ), and Range Resources (NYSE: RRC ). Bigger players such as Exxon (NYSE: XOM ) have been leasing/trading acreage in PXD's core area in the Permian as recently as last year. Insiders have been selling over the past year, though. When insiders begin buying shares or if crude and liquids prices begin to trend upwards, I will be a buyer of PXD.
