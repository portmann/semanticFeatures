Intel Growth In 2016 - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha World economy forecast to grow 2.8% in 2015 and 3.3% in 2016 representing an 18% increase in the world wide economic growth rate. Intel Data Center Group in 2015 will produce over 55% of Intel overall operating revenue, growing to 60% in 2016. Maybe more. Intel overall guidance is for mid single digit sales growth and 62% gross margin plus or minus a couple points. This provides a range for stock prices up to $52. For the last couple of years the world economy has dipped and so have sales of Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) processors worldwide. According to the World Bank , 2016 will be a turning point with economic growth coming out of the 2.5% to 2.8% range to rise above 3% to 3.3% in 2016. Intel Data Center Group growth has been extremely under appreciated by the market. Very few analysts recognize that the Network Virtualization TAM (Total Addressable Market) is $17b and that from 2014 to 2015 Intel's share of this market has grown from 7% ($1.2b) to 9.5% ($1.6b). Phone companies estimate that currently about 5% of their networks are virtualized and that by 2020 75% will be virtualized on general purpose processors (Intel). With Intel having 95%+ of the general purpose processor market, reaching 75% virtualization of $17b would add over $10b to Intel DCG sales by 2020 (currently Intel sales for 2015 are estimated to be ~$55b). With DCG operating profit being 49% of sales, DCG's contribution to Intel's overall operating profit will grow from $7.6b (55% of overall in 2015) to $17.6b (76% of overall in 2020). This model assumes that Intel will remain flat except for growth in the DCG (likely that other growth areas such as non-volatile memory and IoT will make up for slight declines in CCG sales). This graph shows clearly the significant impact that network Virtualization will have on Intel DCG profits and Intel's overall profits. On December 1 Intel CEO will provide additional insights into Intel at the Credit Suisse 2015 TMT Conference On December 2 Intel's IoTG manager will provide further insights about the future of Intel IoT at the Nasdaq Investor Program Another approval related to Altera purchase (maybe China blessing) Intel revision to Q4'15 revenue guidance from the current $14.8B+-500M by Dec. 11th (beginning of quiet period). Good news related to expansion of Cloud computing from Adobe (earnings Dec. 10), Oracle (earnings Dec. 16), Red Hat (earnings Dec. 17) Here is a range of predictions for Intel stock for 2016 based on Intel guidance and various scenarios. The approach takes into account the earnings and the shine associated with Intel. The shine is measured by the Price to Earnings ratio. The higher the shine, the higher the PE ratio. Intel currently has a PE ratio of 16. Last year Intel reached 18 and prior to 2010 Intel enjoyed a PE of 20. This provides a PE range of 16 to 20. Earnings are provided a range by Intel with their mid-single digits guidance for revenues (3% to 7%) and their 62% gross margin plus or minus a couple of points (60% to 64%). To get to the top of the Intel Guidance range Intel will need to accomplish some (not all) of the following: Increase sales of PCs (2-in-1, clamshells, desktops) Basically instead of disappointing by late implementation, Intel needs to start surprising by early implementation. Regardless of how Intel implements their strategies, outside forces will have an impact on Intel earnings and shine. The biggest impact will be the economic health of the world. The more growth there is in the world economy, the more people will need and be able to purchase computing devices with high powered processors. The increase in world economic growth from the 2.5 to 2.8 range up to 3.3 will be a huge boost to Intel worldwide sales.
