Apple's cash pile declines slightly; R&D, strategic investment activity up - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Jul 27 2016, 11:33 ET | About: Apple Inc. (AAPL) | By: Eric McCaffrey , SA News Editor Apple's ( AAPL +7%) cash on hand was reduced to $231.5B in Q3 vs. $233B in Q2, the first time in seven quarters this figure has decreased. Research and development expenses rose for the nine-months-ended June 25 period to $7.475B vs. $5.847B Y/Y. The three-month-ended time frame saw an increase to $2.56B vs. $2.034B Y/Y. The majority of investment activity stems from the company's $1B investment in Didi Chuxing, a Chinese transportation service and Uber competitor. Tim Cook on yesterday's conference call : "In terms of the investment in Didi, it was an unusual investment in  that, as you know, we don't have a long history of doing a lot of these. . . . From a Didi point of view, we see that as one, a great investment. Two,  we think that there's some strategic things that the companies can do  together over time. And three, we think that we'll learn a lot about the  business and the Chinese market beyond what we currently know. Didi has  an incredible team there. That's sort of the rational for why we did  that." Although Apple appears to be utilizing a larger than usual (though still relatively small) portion of its vast cash pile, investors and consumers alike are waiting on the company's next innovative move, whether that be through existing product lineups, a Project Titan car initiative or any other surprise moves the company has on deck. And Pokemon Go just came out weeks before the quarter ended. I'm looking forward to the 4th quarter to see if AAPL sees a spike in service revenues from apps ETF Screener: Search and filter by asset class, strategy, theme, performance, yield, and much more ETF Performance: View ETF performance across key asset classes and investing themes
