3 Reasons To Own Microsoft In 2016 - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. Microsoft's cloud computing platform, Azure, is growing quickly and represents legitimate competition to Amazon's "Amazon Web Services" or AWS cloud platform. Microsoft's subscription-based model for its "Office" suite of products should increase lifetime value per customer by 80%, and investors should appreciate the more reliable revenue stream. A 2.6% dividend yield represents a 25% premium to the S&P 500 yield. And with $12.41 per share in cash, Microsoft has plenty of capital to continue increasing its dividend. As we kick off a new year, our focus is turning to investment opportunities that provide stability and risk management. Positions that have potential for reliable growth, and investments that pay generous dividend yields. One of the stocks that has risen to the top of my list is Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ). Historically, the company developed a reputation of being a slow-moving software company with very little innovation. But since Satya Nadella took over the CEO position in February of 2014, Microsoft has become much more responsive to a rapidly changing technology world. Wall Street analysts currently expect Microsoft to generate $2.75 per share in fiscal 2016 (Microsoft operates with a June 30 year end). This represents earnings growth of 11.8% over the $2.46 per share earned in 2016. Thanks to the company's improved prospects, shares of MSFT moved 19.4% higher in 2015, settling at $55.48 per share. The year 2015 also marked the first time since 1999 that shares have hit a new high. While shares of MSFT outperformed the flat market in 2015, and trades very near its all-time high, new adjustments in the company's business model should continue to send the shares higher this year, making MSFT one of my top choices for income investors in 2016. During the fiscal first quarter (Ending September 30), Microsoft reported that Azure's revenue grew by 135% over last year. This rate of growth is significantly above the 78% rate of growth that Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ) reported for it's own cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services. Azure is far from a small startup division for Microsoft. Research firm FBR Capital Markets expects that Azure will reach an annual run rate of $8 billion this year. In 2015, Amazon's AWS Services pulled in $7 billion . So while Amazon's growth rate will likely keep AWS ahead of Azure for a few more quarters, Microsoft is quickly narrowing the gap. Investors should note that Amazon currently trades at a valuation of nearly 120 times this year's expected earnings per share. Much of that premium is because of investors' optimism for AWS growth and profitability. While Azure's revenue for this year will only represent about 7.7% of Microsoft's annual revenue of $90.8 billion, the division's growth rate and the potential for wider profit margins could lift the overall valuation for Microsoft's stock, much the way Amazon's valuation is much higher than it would be as a simple online retailer. For the past several quarters, Microsoft has been selling its "Office" suite of products (including Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint) to a subscription-based revenue model. Under this platform, users pay either a monthly or an annual subscription fee to have access to the latest version of these products. By adopting this subscription model, Microsoft is able to capture more reliable revenue from its products, instead of relying on new releases of the suite to drive large one-time sales events. Investors should appreciate this model because it helps to smooth out revenue and create more visibility for future quarters. The model turns out to be more profitable over the long run as well. According to a recent Barron's article (subscription required at link), Microsoft believes that the new model will boost average revenue for each user by 1.8 times. The article also states that there are now 18 million retail customers using the new subscription revenue model and 25% of the company's corporate users have also adopted this model. Offering software through a subscription model, and using the cloud to distribute the software and store much of the data is a model that has been excellently employed by Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM ). Investors appear quite taken with this subscription model as Salesforce commands a valuation of more than 104 times expected earnings for this year. (CRM operates with a January 31 fiscal calendar). Microsoft's sheer size and slower growth rate will prevent the company from trading at a triple-digit forward PE. But the company's multiple could certainly expand as it adopts a subscription revenue model that adds more value to each customer and leads to more reliable periodic revenue. Microsoft currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.36 per share. While this only nets out to an annual yield near 2.6%, Microsoft should be able to significantly increase its dividend over time. The company's last dividend (recorded on November 17th), represented an increase of 16% over the August dividend. More importantly, Microsoft has been increasing its dividend every year (except for 2009) since the company began paying a dividend in August of 2004. Today, Microsoft currently has $5.4 billion - or about $12.41 per share - in cash on its balance sheet. This gives the company plenty of cash to use for future dividend increases, or for a special dividend such as the $3.08 dividend paid to investors in November of 2014. Microsoft has also been using its massive cash position to buy back shares of stock and reduce the overall share count. At the end of 2013, there were 8.3 billion shares outstanding. Today, that number has dropped by nearly 4% to 7.99 billion. Fewer shares outstanding means that more cash is available per remaining share. With Microsoft's stock now trading at a high valuation (more on that in a moment), it is becoming less strategic for the company to use cash to buy back shares. Investors won't be pleased to see the company using cash to pay a higher price for its own shares, and so there will be more pressure on management to use the $5.4 billion to pay out investors. Later this year, I expect Microsoft to announce another dividend increase - possibly much more than the 16% increase from 2015. Meanwhile, the 2.6% yield is still 25% above the 2.08% yield on the S&P 500. Buy Microsoft Despite The High Valuation Today, shares of MSFT are trading near 20.5 times expected earnings. This represents a peak valuation compared to anytime over the past five years. A high valuation for shares of Microsoft make sense, simply because the company's prospects today are better than they have been at any time in the past five years. Under Nadella's leadership, the company has become innovative and responsive to changes in the business environment. Not only is Microsoft improving its products to make them more user friendly, the company is also selling these products in a manner that makes them more accessible to consumers (and ironically drives more lifetime value per customer). The Barron's article mentioned above stated that shares of MSFT could rise by 30% over the next 18 months. That projection may wind up being too conservative. According to YCharts, Analysts are expecting MSFT to earn $3.33 per share in fiscal 2018. If Microsoft continues to execute on its growth strategy with Azure, and the company is able to convince analysts of the higher customer value as a result of subscription-based products, that projection could increase to $3.75 or more. If investors are willing to pay 25 times earnings for this $3.75 estimate (a valuation that implies significant growth expectations, but still falls short of the valuation placed on Amazon and Salesforce.com), the stock would reach a share price of $93.75. This represents a 69% increase over the next 18 months, giving investors a strong potential return alongside a healthy (and growing) dividend yield. This is why Microsoft is one of my favorite income investments for 2016. Tagged: Investing Ideas , Technology
