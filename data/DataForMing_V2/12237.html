Market-Maker Price Range Forecasts For DJIA Stocks, Now Including Apple | Seeking Alpha Mar. 25, 2015 12:49 PM ET  |  Includes: AAPL , CSCO , KO , MMM , MSFT , T , V , VZ by: Peter F. Way, CFA The Dow-Jones 30 Index now includes Apple, Inc., (AAPL), replacing AT&T (T). Market-maker hedging to protect their at-risk positions required to provide trade liquidity for big-volume fund clients reveals implied price range forecasts of each index stock component. Prior forecasts with upside-to-downside balances like todayâ€™s tell how likely these forecasts may come to pass in the next 3 months, providing comparisons among them. The horizontal green scale indicates how much upside price change from today's closing price the market pros think can happen in the next few days, weeks, or even months. They are satisfied enough that it may happen that they will pay part of their trade spreads for protection against such action. They also are buying downside protection to cover price declines of similar concern. The red vertical scale of Figure 1 shows what the worst-case price drawdowns have been for these stocks in periods following prior forecasts like today's. Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) at [8] is the index component with the largest upside of all 30 stocks, and a downside history bettered by only 6 other index members. Some index components in Figure 1 occupy duplicative positions on the Reward~Risk Tradeoff map. Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ) at [6] has the least favorable R~R tradeoff as a buy, and Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO ) at [10] may have the most favorable tradeoff at present. This table presents important prospective rate of return selection considerations. AAPL has the largest forecast upside sell target at this point in time 3M (NYSE: MMM ) has the best (lowest) range index (smallest downside to upside forecast) Chevron (NYSE: CVX ) has had the shortest number of days to reach sell target (and a poor payoff average) All but Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) have about 50 or more Range Index forecasts like today's AAPL and KO tie for the best prospective reward (5) to risk (6) ratio at today's prices Column (15) is a ranking that assembles and weights many of these considerations, making V appear as the most attractive of the moment, and Apple Inc. the next most attractive. Your judgment may vary. Tomorrow's ranking probably will, as prices change. The Figure 1 picture can be found at no cost on blockdesk.com every day.
