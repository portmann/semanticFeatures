Listeria bacteria was found in apples that may be in prepared fruit platters and snack packs from supermarket H-E-B, and they’ve all been recalled. If you purchased anything that contained fresh sliced red or green apples at H-E-B in Texas recently with a “best by” date between March 16 and April 11, you’ll want to check it against the recall list .

The grocer conducted its own testing, which caught the possible contamination, and there have been no reported or confirmed illnesses from the products. If you still have the recalled product, return it to the store for a refund. If you have any questions about the recall, contact packager Fresh from Texas at (817) 690-2330.
