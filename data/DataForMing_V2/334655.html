N.Y. judge backs Apple in encryption fight - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Mar  1 2016, 03:42 ET | About: Apple Inc. (AAPL) | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor The U.S. government cannot force Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) to unlock an iPhone in a New York drug case, U.S. Magistrate Judge James Orenstein declared on Monday, a ruling that could affect a similar decision involving the San Bernardino shooter's iPhone in California. "It would betray our constitutional heritage and our people’s claim to democratic governance for a judge to pretend that our Founders already had that debate, and ended it, in 1789,” Judge Orenstein wrote, referring to the archaic All Writs Act. The ruling, which will likely shape the broader battle about privacy and security, comes before today's congressional testimony on "San Bernardino" from Apple and the FBI. If Apple made safes instead of phones would it be OK for the government to tell them to put in a manufacturers code allowing them to access any safe 1234? Of Course Not because that would be stupid and defeat the point of privacy, get better safecrackers if you want to look inside! The possible contents are immaterial, the alleged criminal or their crime is immaterial, all that matters is it is unconstitutional you would think it's easy when it's a terrorist but having principles is never easy and being in a free society means you must stand up for all peoples right to privacy even those who are diametrically opposed to you, especially then!
