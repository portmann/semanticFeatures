A&E/Vice Media 24-hour channel Viceland to debut in early 2016 - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha To screen ETFs by asset class, performance, yield and more, check out the ETF Hub. ETF Hub Nov  3 2015, 12:54 ET | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor A&E and Vice Media make their channel plan official, setting up Viceland to launch as a 24-hour network, programmed by Vice, in early 2016. The channel, featuring hundreds of hours of new programming, will be distributed initially in about 70M homes and overseen by Oscar-winning director Spike Jonze. As previously reported , the move has been in the works since A&E -- part-owned by Hearst and Disney ( DIS +0.8%) -- put $250M into Vice for a 10% stake last year, though it had to overcome a lone holdout in DirecTV to rebranding A&E's H2 channel. Vice will get a minority interest in the channel, and in exchange, A&E's interest in Vice goes to 20%. Disney is still expected to make a separate $200M investment in Vice. Viceland plans a full slate of prime-time shows with a youth focus that can expand on A&E's existing network portfolio, including Gaycation with Ellen Page and Ian Daniel, Vice World of Sports, Noisey, Party Legends, Weediquette and more.
