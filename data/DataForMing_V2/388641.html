Apple Watch debut-year sales double iPhone in its first year - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apr 25 2016, 03:00 ET | About: Apple Inc. (AAPL) | By: Yigal Grayeff , SA News Editor Despite mixed perceptions about Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Watch - high-profile VC Fred Wilson has called it a "flop" - analysts reckon the the company has sold 12-13M in the year since its launch, or double the 6M iPhones that were sold in its first 12 months of sales. Yes, but the novelty is over. Whoever wanted a Apple Watch owns one and they will not upgrade quickly as there is no demand for a used one. When will Apple offer an iPhone with Hardware, Software, Carrier, Content, Encryption and Cloud OUT OF ONE HAND and absolutely hassle-free? And please in 5 different sizes (4.0 4.5 5.0 5.5 6.0) and 2 different thicknesses (normal and battery+). Let the consumer decide what size he wants! If they can protect this new wireless charging at distance those watches and phone will skyocket, "rumors they have partnered with WATT," have been running rampant I own an Apple Watch for one year now. I use it everyday and find it an indispensable tool together with the iPhone. I use it as a messenger, news source, communicatior, note taker with Siri. Battery life is not an issue (after 14 hrs of use still has 40-50%) 13 million, 6 B business in one year is consider a flop?? Bad faith, ignorance or both from many who never used or look closely at the Watch. I have no friends looking to buy a Apple Watch. Unlike a iPhone. Nobody wants a Apple Watch. It does nothing new it is just a accessory. It is just a fad. It serves no purpose but a watch replacement. They are not addressing a specific market like Fitbit. They are general and trying to create a market that does not exist outside whatever they have reached in year one. Again, I know of absolutely nobody I know that says I want a Apple Watch but a few that want a iPhone 7. They need the watch to do something new and it does nothing new with a battery life that just makes it close to a nightmare trying to worry about while keeping your phone charged at the same time. Flopplwatch is DOA, where does he get ASPs of $500 when they are on Groupon, ebay, Bestbuy and Target at discounted prices? Sales are going to be flopping like the ifads, sales are declining 20%-30% at a rapid clip. A babysitter, for example, will inevitably find the Apple Watch handier than the iPhone. Be more patient. Go very long or go home.
