InvenSense: Don't Fear Short-Term Margins - InvenSense (NYSE:INVN) | Seeking Alpha InvenSense sits close to multi-year lows due to margin pressure from obtaining business from Apple. The company has several catalysts to push gross margins back toward the 50% target including China OEMs, IoT and wearables. Ironically, 2014 was the year that InvenSense (NYSE: INVN ) finally landed target customer Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), yet the stock began 2015 hitting multi-year lows. Though knowing Apple is brutal on margins, investors sold the stock off based on relative margin numbers instead of focusing on the absolute top and bottom line growth. In general, investors are missing the big picture for the maker of motion sensors. InvenSense has seen explosive growth from smartphones, but the future of wearables and the Internet of Things allows for substantial long-term growth and margin expansion now that it controls the high-end smartphone market. The stock is attractive trading at less than 25x fiscal 2016 (ending March) earnings with the company having the potential to greatly expand margins and leverage operating expenses going forward. The stock slumped 30% following the December quarter earnings beat due to disillusioned investors expecting irrational bottom line growth. With Apple now locked in as a customer, will InvenSense finally generate predictable growth and reduce the volatility in the stock? What's important for investors to understand is that the customer concentration of Apple and Samsung (OTC: SSNLF ) pressures gross margins, but it doesn't hit operating margins to the same extent due to higher revenue covering a base level of operating expenses. In addition, InvenSense ramped up operating expenses in the current fiscal year ending in March that it won't repeat next year. What was lost with most investors is that the company produced record revenue. The nearly 74% revenue growth offset some of the margin pressure. In the latest quarter, InvenSense saw gross margins of 46% sit below long-term gross margin targets of over 50%, but the operating margins jumped back to 20%. The important part lost in the weeds of focusing on relative percentage numbers is that the absolute numbers jumped to record levels due to gains in gross profit. While gross margins took a hit during the quarter, gross profit jumped to $50.4 million from $31.6 million in FQ3 last year. For FQ3, InvenSense produced substantially higher net income of $19.3 million, up from $4.9 million last year, despite the lower gross margins. Even with a greater than 50% increase in operating expenses, net income jumped to record levels. The long-term goal of mid-50% gross margins appears next to impossible unless they lose Apple as a client. The operating margin of over 25% appears doable considering NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ: NXPI ) rebounded from a spin off from Philips to now generate those exact operating margins. Note that level of margin is nearly double the margin generated so far by InvenSense in FY15. Assuming these more normalized margins long-term, InvenSense could easily double the $0.46 EPS estimate for the year to generate $0.92. Clearly investors would have more excitement over earning closer to $1 than the actual forecasts for only $0.46. While Apple dominated the December quarter discussion, the majority of the revenue through the first nine months of the year came from other customers. Not to mention, InvenSense produced $253 million in FY14 revenue without any revenue from the most valuable company in the world. Based on info from the company, the quarterly non-Apple revenue in FY15 is as follows: Even more encouraging is that gross margins remained above 50% for the business outside the top two customers. The Chinese mobile OEMs provide higher content potential with a desire to use full solutions from InvenSense that provide higher monetization. Unlike Apple that only wants a hardware solution, the Chinese OEMs are able to get their products out to the market quicker with the use of full solutions versus selective parts. The only issue though is that investors were happier with the 50% gross margins in FQ1, but InvenSense only earned $0.08 during the quarter prior to starting the Apple business. Sure this suggests the Apple business only contributes gross margins in the 42% range based on 45% of the revenue in FQ3, but it still contributes to higher revenues and absolute net income. With the coming IoT and wearable revolution, investors place too much of the InvenSense valuation based on low margins from the current top two customers. Even with the substantially lower gross margins from Apple and the higher expenses for R&D on advanced sensors, software, optical image stabilizers and microphones, the company still saw a huge jump in operating income. Further growth will lead to better leverage in FY16 and going forward. With analysts forecasting roughly 50% earnings growth next year, the stock is a must own at the current valuation with the stock trading around $16.50.
