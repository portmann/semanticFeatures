Amazon.com Is Not Etsy's Only Problem - Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY) | Seeking Alpha ETSY has fallen more than 50% since its IPO. Wedbush, and other firms, are noting Amazon.com as the biggest threat to ETSY's business. Pinterest might be an even bigger threat, and combined with AMZN, it could get much worse for ETSY before it gets better. Six months ago, Etsy's (NASDAQ: ETSY ) business model sounded like a good idea, but after a 52% post-IPO stock loss, Etsy has officially won the award for worst timing ever. That's not because of its stock performance, but rather increased competition that is getting tougher by the day, for Etsy that is. Shortly after Etsy's IPO, it ranked in the bottom five of my numeric research platform . Therefore, I never expected much from the stock or company. However, I didn't expect the competitive assault it would suffer so soon. That said, much of Etsy's stock loss has been attributed to Amazon.com's (NASDAQ: AMZN ) entrance into the handmade goods industry. That's the industry Etsy calls home, allowing its 1.4 million sellers to create revenue by selling to 21 million buyers who call themselves Etsy users. That's all good and all, but what happens to Etsy when Amazon.com enters the market with 250 million plus users? According to Wedbush , the threat of Amazon.com entering the $34 billion handmade goods industry is a legitimate threat for Etsy, as is the threat that 5% of all goods sold through Etsy violate trademark laws. That's why Wedbush downgraded the stock to Underperform last week, even after its large stock losses post-IPO. However, despite my low rating on the stock, I'm not sold on the idea that Amazon.com is as great of a risk as many expect. Amazon.com has more or less become the Walmart of e-commerce, but that doesn't serve as proof that it can create an independent platform as successful in the handmade goods space, or that it can enter niche retail markets with high success. While I think Amazon.com will perform OK, I think that from a competitive stance that Etsy will be fine. However, because of Amazon.com's willingness to undercut on price, I think the bigger threat is that Etsy will have to lower its rates for selling and listing goods. Still, Etsy has established itself in the handmade goods space, Amazon.com still has to prove itself. All things considered, I think Pinterest is a much bigger threat, something that not many have considered. Pinterest is a platform that's known for handmade goods, crafts, and interesting ideas in general. In the past, Pinterest's 70 million users could only Pin products they like, and Pinterest would show them other items of similar interest. Now, Pinterest is launching buyable pins so that users can buy the products/goods they like. This is direct competition against Etsy, and a legitimate threat against an established handmade goods platform. Not only does Pinterest have triple the user base of Pinterest, but it also has more resources at its disposal. Just recently, The WSJ valued Pinterest at $11 billion after a recent fundraising hiked its total equity investment haul to $1.3 billion. Hence, Pinterest's funding alone is very close to Etsy's entire market capitalization. With much of Pinterest's pins being do-it-yourself recipes, hair styles, and cooking recipes, there is a lot that can't be sold with buyable pins. However, with 30 billion unique pins, a number that doubles every nine months, Pinterest has more than enough supply to compete with Etsy. The bottom line is that Etsy now faces two very different but legitimate threats in Amazon.com and Pinterest. Strangely enough, neither were considered too big of a threat when Etsy IPOd just two months back. The existence of these new threats should be very alarming to Etsy shareholders, especially given the fact that Etsy's gross merchandise volume in the first quarter grew just 28%, down significantly from nearly 45% last year, and did so despite having no real competitive threat. While Etsy might one day fall to a valuation where its investment appeal rises, I don't think it is yet to find such support. In retrospect, one must know the effect that Pinterest and Amazon.com will have on Etsy's gross merchandise volume before making an informed investment decision, and with neither company yet to launch their competing service, investors must believe that Etsy's stock could get worse before getting better.
