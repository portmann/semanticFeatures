WhatsApp axes subscription fee - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Jan 18 2016, 10:45 ET | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor Facebook-owned (NASDAQ: FB ) messaging service WhatsApp will scrap its subscription fee and explore other ways to allow businesses to interact with its users (but will not introduce third-party ads) to make up for the lost revenue. "Many WhatsApp users don't have a debit or credit card number and they worried they'd lose access to their friends and family after their first year," the company wrote in a blog post . I'm confused. So they lose 5 billion, and they expect it to be replaced by--- what exactly? If there's no ads, how the heck do we get our $5billion back? Has Facebook just lost $5billion of its value? I don't think it's meant to make money. It's meant so that no company has control over chat but Facebook. "...explore other ways to allow businesses to interact with its users (but will not introduce third-party ads) to make up for the lost revenue." Interesting. I have been wondering about this for a while. Primarily because I was interested to learn about how users would have to pay. So I asked a number of people of whom I know they are on WA longer than a year. All answered that they had never paid or been asked to pay. This was puzzling because in my country virtually everyone has de debit card. So in my eyes this news is not WA dropping something. You cannot drop something that was never implemented, at least as far as my country (Netherlands) is concerned. The will make  a ton of money down the line as they control this very important communication space. I expect the channel could eventually be used for mobile payment. Mark is doing great thinking ahead.
