Apple's Fall: Why It's A Buy - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Compared to the market, Apple's earnings are a bargain for the price. Competitiveness, as quantified objectively in gross margins and market segment dominance, remains high. Following its last earnings report , Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has suffered a headline-drawing price drop that's left it more than $20 below its recent all-time high. Is this the beginning of the end for Apple? Or is this another colossal misunderstanding? This article explains why the value case for Apple is only strengthened by the post-earnings selloff. Before the recent selloff, The Jaded Consumer's bull case for Apple rested on a multi-legged stool of low marginal costs from high vertical integration, high profits from dominance of the best market segments , and high quality maintained by regular investment in the technologies that differentiate Apple's products so as to enable premium pricing at the top end. The evidence this effectively set Apple ahead of competitors historically rested on surveys of Apple's customers (keeping customers, and building personal recommendations as an advertising method, both depend on customer reaction to the products' performance in everyday use) and - to prove this had a real-world effect on Apple's bottom line - Apple's profit share . Yes, profit share. Sales share is for chumps. Ask Nokia Corp. (NYSE: NOK ), which while it remained in the handset business was losing money despite Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT ) forking over ten-digit subsidies to prolong it in the business of selling Windows Phone hardware. When eventually, as Nokia lay on life support, Microsoft found it necessary to buy the company in order to keep its Windows Phone units rolling off the assembly line, Microsoft found itself no more capable than Nokia to make money selling units below cost. Hence, the recent 7,800-job bloodbath and the $7.6 billion post-purchase write-down. To put the $7.6 billion write-down in perspective, consider that Microsoft last quarter alone wrote Nokia-related goodwill down from $5.4 billion to $116 million - a dramatic 98% reduction - and Microsoft in 2014, just last year, bought Nokia's devices business for $7.2 billion. Now as ever, mobile hardware remains a brutal business . Or ask an Android vendor. The world market share of Android is frequently cited as evidence Android owns the future. Even if "the future" takes a long time to arrive, is this the beginning of the end for Apple ? If Apple's future lay in international markets, then what should be made of Android's dominant share abroad ? Traditionally, the attack on Apple has grown from concerns that Apple's competitors are catching up on quality, Apple's product differentiation is shrinking, and Apple will inevitably descend into low-margin unit-share competition - a game people saw Apple lose on the '90s against Microsoft's Windows OEMs. Is this movie about to repeat? Technical analysts were quick to point out that Apple's latest decline pushed share prices below their 200-day moving average , which should - they say - "give any investors a cause for concern." Value investing isn't about plotting stock price chart graphs. Peter Lynch, author of One Up On Wall Street , famously said that "[c]harts are great for predicting the past." Warren Buffett has alternately said that charts looked the same to him upside-down, or that he realized price-chart-gazing "didn't work when I turned the charts upside down and didn't get a different answer." From a value perspective, cheaper prices could mean all kinds of things - the market catching on to a dud, or foolish sellers dumping a long-term winner. Remember when Buffett bought a American Express (NYSE: AXP ) after the salad oil scandal hit? The abrupt stock drop represented an overreaction, creating a buy opportunity that's increased Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A )(NYSE: BRK.B ) yield on the shares ever since . So, is that Apple now? Or is Apple the next Motorola (for which Yahoo! delightfully lists a share price of $0 - want some?) or Nokia - once top the mobile world, but descending now into irrelevance? To answer that, one tries to look at the world like Lynch and Buffett: to compare the price to what the company's worth. First, let's compare the price of Apple's earnings to the price one must pay to get the same earnings from the broader market. Compared to the estimated Price-to-Earnings ratio of 21.28 (at the time of writing) for the S&P 500, is Apple frighteningly expensive? Apple's trailing P/E seems closer to 13 than to 21, making its earnings cheaper. A chart of P/E based on "forward earnings" involves the uncertainty of others' estimates, but it provides a P/E less than 13: The real question is whether products like the AppleTV and Apple Watch provide some kind of weathervane into Apple's future: is the company done? If onlookers don't see that it's about to fall off a cliff, the forward P/E they project might not mean much more than a Motorola stock certificate. So let's have a look at the factors that lead to earnings at Apple, and see how those are looking. Apple's historical profit originally came from computers, then music products (a Microsoft employee once asked me why Apple didn't close down its computer business to sell iPods, bless his heart), then - most recently - smartphones. Currently, nearly two thirds of Apple's global revenues are iPhone revenues, which are in turn the vast majority of Apple's revenues from iOS. Although the App Store historically led Google Inc.'s (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google Play in revenue, we've been hearing for years that the sheer size of Google's installed base and its growing Google Play revenue will cause it to inevitably surpass the App Store in software sales just as Android's vast unit sales have made iOS devices a minority worldwide. And how's that played out? In 2015, the App Store lead on Google Play actually widened . Moreover, Google's mobile revenues don't come primarily from its huge Android installed base: Apple's iOS ecosystem is so valuable, it now drives 75% of Google's mobile revenue . But Apple's revenues aren't primarily post-sales revenues, even in markets rich with post-sales opportunities like the mobile market. Unlike Google, whose position in mobile is predominantly a platform vendor (with costs and benefits deriving from the platform rather than hardware ), Apple makes its real money as a hardware vendor. Every year, huge rivals roll out hardware intended to take Apple's premium customers with just-cheaper devices. It's a dog-eat-dog world. Why, Apple 's last-announced quarter was so tough its revenues were up only 33% and its earnings per share up only 45%. For those of you who don't own Apple shares and think the per-share numbers don't matter, Apple's last quarter netted it $10.7 billion. Isn't that sad? Are those vultures circling? No, wait. Double-digit revenue growth, and profit growth outstripping revenues? This isn't a company whose margins are collapsing to keep unit sales share, this is a company that's widening its margins. Expanding its hardware margins is exactly the kind of thing that proves Apple retains its position in the mobile hardware catbird seat. The iPhone models that drove up Apple's average selling price ("ASP") for iPhones earlier this year have continued to bear fruit, driving Apple's June quarter's iPhone ASP up $99 over the prior-year quarter to $660. While Apple's per-unit prices rose, its edge on margins endured: Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) charges less than Apple for its Galaxy S6, but spends more money building each phone . Part of this may be that Samsung's got a huge fabrication plant to keep occupied - an overhead cost Apple avoids by bidding fabricators against one another to keep unit prices down. The fact Samsung sells a nice big phone doesn't mean it can make as much money as Apple on them, which means it's got to sell even more of them just to match Apple's profit. Since the post-sales revenue from Samsung's phone falls largely in Google's coffers, keeping up with Apple is a tough task for mobile hardware competitors - even ones as successful as Samsung. Samsung's relatively modest unit sales on its highest-end models make it risky to invest in custom CPUs, so Samsung buys an off-the-shelf part from the same suppliers that serve its Android competitors. Investing in differentiating features is challenging for a company that must deploy an externally-controlled Android platform in order to access the marketplace, even before considering the financial risk. If Apple lends a half-billion dollars to a sapphire vendor that can't meet its yield demands , it can simply repurpose the facility that secured its loan into a data center . After all, Apple's back-end services require more data centers, so what's to lose? For Apple - whose vertically integrated business reaches further uphill than competitors whose product stops at the hardware - the risk of billion-dollar bets is just not that frightening. Apple's scale creates opportunities competitors just don't have, reducing Apple's risk on projects competitors would rationally avoid. So it's no surprise Apple is preparing phones with features like force-touch , intended to train users to expect interface features competitors won't easily offer uniformly across their product lines. Differentiation may really affect the way some games work, but it may also create subtle differences in interface behavior that make other products fee different, unexpected, and alien - thereby raising customer reluctance to switch. For Apple, this is a cheap improvement it can leverage with some in-house software adaptation. For competitors? Not so much. Likewise, Apple faces little barrier in picking up tech firms like Anobit , a fabless semiconductor firm that designs memory controllers Apple can deploy across its entire product lineup, reducing its component costs by owning more of the technology it deploys and enabling it to use components that, with lesser controllers, would provide iffy performance. If Apple can save money owning tech that allows it to use cheaper parts, why not drop a few hundred million? By steadily investing in technology that maintains both Apple's differentiation and its margins advantage, Apple helps maintain the math behind its profit engine. And remember, it's earnings - not unit volume - that matters. It's not unit price alone, or unit sales alone, but the maximized product of unit margins and unit sales, that keeps Apple at the top of the top end. A few years ago, Apple made headlines making 56% of the world's mobile profits with its minority market share. Far from suffering erosion of its dominant position, Apple has solidified its hold: Apple now earns 92% of the operating income reaped by the world's top eight smartphone vendors - up from 65% a year ago. It's even up from the 89% of global smartphone profit Apple took in the last calendar quarter of 2014, when it first launched its current phone model. This isn't based on Apple's industry-crushing mobile software revenue, but is limited solely to the apples-to-apples comparison of hardware revenues between hardware vendors. Apple adds to this revenue the ad income earned when its customers shop. Last Black Friday, smartphones drove just over a third of all online sales traffic. Apple's iOS devices (smartphones and tablets) drove 34.2% of total online traffic, more than double all Android devices' aggregate traffic of 15%. When an Android customer did make a purchase, Apple's customer trounced it with an average order size 24.3% larger than an Android customer's. While other smartphone vendors don't generally share in this post-sales revenue, Apple gets to compete not just with the hardware vendors its trouncing but with the platform vendors and search vendors who pay for access to Apple's premium customers. ( Reportedly , Microsoft and Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ: YHOO ) are vying for the default-search position on Apple's products when the deal with Google expires.) Contrary to reports that sales of Apple Watch collapsed to fewer than 20,000 watches per day after an initial sales surge, Tim Cook reported in July that Apple's accelerating sales had made June its best sales month yet. But, honestly: since when did we think wristwatches were going to beat computers in revenue - much less smartphones? The Apple Watch is an interesting piece of tech that allows Apple more involvement in its users' everyday lives - unlocking hotel rooms , paying for groceries - but it's never contributed materially to Apple's bottom line. The AppleTV business nobody talks about is of greater strategic value to embedding Apple in homes, providing media content and potentially coordinating home automation . Between AppleTV and video sales, it's a billion dollar business already. On the other hand, does anybody else sell tens of thousands of smartwatches per day? The big revenue drivers at Apple are not only resisting attack, they're extending their moats to fend off encroachment. From about 35 million iPhone units in the year-ago quarter, Apple grew unit volume past 47 million units - while raising average sales price and expanding its competitive position in margins. Apple isn't a company losing its grip on its competitive position, it's a company carefully executing a profit-maximizing strategy to sell enormous unit volumes on Spartan production costs at prices that reflect its products' quality and their differentiation in the marketplace. The proof Apple's product is differentiated is its price: a commodity product would not command Apple's premium pricing. And far from being subject to commodity pricing pressure, Apple's seen customers intentionally pay extra to shop up Apple's product line, raising their average purchase price. Apple products are not a collapsing fad, they're a competitive powerhouse. Apple's headline-driven price route represent a bargain both to Apple's recent prices and to the broader market. Whatever traders may conclude from the squiggly lines on their charts, Apple shares remain a represent a buy for investors.
