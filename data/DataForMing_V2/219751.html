ETF Hub Oct 28 2015, 19:41 ET | About: Verizon Communications (VZ) | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Verizon's (NYSE: VZ ) "Internet of Things" revenue has hit $500M this year, and the company is planning as soon as Q1 to offer options with less overhead to ease adoption. Most devices that could talk to the Web don't, because of high connectivity costs, but Verizon's Mike Lanman says the company will work to make the service more mainstream. “The current network was built around smartphones,” Lanman said. “By lowering the cost of the modules and providing an offer where network access is more affordable,” the company could compete with Wi-Fi and convince gadget makers to put lifetime cellular access into the products themselves. IDC estimates there will be 30B connected devices around the world by 2020, and the market for the gadgets will hit $1.7T. “IoT isn’t going to be synonymous with cellular connectivity,” says IDC's Carrie MacGillivray, but Verizon “will move the needle a little bit." The real question winds up being whether or not someone is collecting royalties on the protocols used for communications like this: WiFi is short range, but relatively royalty-free.  It's also an open, evolving standard.  Comment there, not here, if you want a response from me. I will Not be owning a fridge, microwave or toaster that "links" with my cell phone. Not gonna happen,  ever. I'm with you. I'm a techie and belive toaster etc on network is to increase cost of ownership with marginal added utility. Having been a Verizon customer and NOT a Techie I have this to say. I don't know how they can handle anything new when their service is abyssmal at best. They have no interest in customers,they don't back up what they sell giving you a used phone for one you bought brand new that doesn't work, they have layer upon layer of passive aggressive customer service people who have ZERO authority to fix anything just there to either frustrate you until you agree to buy a better phone or quit altogether. In my opinion they are the WORST company on the planet. To take on more would simply be too much for their feeble brains.I wouldn't buy their stock on a bet right along with Pro-abortion Starbucks. I have to believe that their business model with implode at some point no matter what they try tech wise.To me their stock is worthless. Peter Lynch said "buy what you know, Buy what you like" i know they suck and I dont like them The customer service from most phone companies is terrible, with Verizon typically considered the best of a bad bunch.  My issue has been that their network is unreliable simply because it is oversold, often resulting in calls going straight to voice mail even when the phone has plenty of signal.
