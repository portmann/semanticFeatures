How Does Apple Compare To Ugly Duckling Kohl's? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple is thought to be extremely cheap on account of its massive earnings and cash position. I decided to compare Apple to an unloved retail name, Kohl's, just to see how cheap Apple might actually be. This article presents the conclusions from that comparison, some of which are surprising, and some of which show why Apple is also a very good business. When it comes to Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), a general consensus exists that the stock is rather cheap. This extends perhaps as much as to include even bears in the name, which usually just claim that while it looks cheap, the company is challenged on two grounds: iPhone dependence and resulting revenue and earnings shrinkage. But is Apple really that cheap? An interesting exercise can be made. Let's compare Apple, which has a lot of fans, to a company in an unrelated and unloved industry and see what we can come up with. The comparison I am going to make is between Apple and Kohl's (NYSE: KSS ). Kohl's, obviously, is not a tech company and instead mostly just runs stores to sell stuff made elsewhere under someone else's name. Now, this isn't exactly central, but it's rather funny that Apple also has its own stores, and that up to ~50% of Kohl's business actually consists in selling its own private label brands. That is, brands that belong to Kohl's but whose manufacture is farmed out (just like the iPhone's). So the companies aren't as different as they might seem. Anyway, let's say that they were indeed as different as they could be. They would still be comparable. Why? Because a dollar is a dollar. A dollar in revenues is a dollar in revenues. A dollar in EBITDA is a dollar in EBITDA. A dollar in FCF (free cash flow) is a dollar in FCF. Indeed, the whole purpose of having accounting and valuation multiples, is to make different companies and different sectors be comparable amongst themselves. For sure, when it comes to relative intra-sector valuation ("what's the cheapest smartphone manufacturer?"), you can only compare between smartphone manufacturers. But when it comes to absolute valuation ("what's the cheapest business?"), you can actually compare across sector lines. You can compare a condo rental development in Florida with a MLP running a pipeline into the Bakken. And if the condo rental is yielding 5% and the MLP is yielding 20% for rather similar risk (quantitatively speaking), then it's likely that your investment dollars will be heading to the Bakken even if you love Florida that much more. What doesn't make a whole lot of sense, is (and here I am going to reference another era) to say "Oh, Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) at 200x earnings is much cheaper than Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) at 400x earnings!" while all the while you could find non-tech companies with comparable growth and profitability going for 10-15x earnings (all values are exemplificative). Yet, this kind of comparison (between the lesser of two great evils) is made much more often than valuation comparisons between companies in wildly different industries, to try and come up with the better investments. Of course, being in different industries introduces very different dynamics and risks. It also introduces different potential revenue growth rates. At the very least, we should thus require that the comparison we're making isn't between wildly different positive growth rates. After all, something growing at 20% per year is always going to command higher valuation multiples versus something showing stagnation, and rightly so. The valuation metric I'll use is EV/EBITDA. EV/EBITDA is rather nice for this comparison because it takes into account debt and cash on hand (usually seen as a great Apple advantage). Also, EBITDA will eliminate the effects of different tax rates and depreciation schedules. I will also compare current revenue growth rates, knowing beforehand that neither of these companies is putting on barn-burning performance - which is exactly what makes both comparable. When it comes to growth, here's what we know: In its most recent quarter, Apple saw its revenues decline 12.8% versus the same quarter the year before. Apple is also expected to see its revenues decline 7.7% during the present fiscal year. In its most recent quarter, Kohl's saw its revenues decline 3.7% versus the same quarter the year before. Kohl's is also expected to see its revenues decline 1.6% during the present fiscal year. Thus, when it comes to growth, it's obvious that Apple is doing a whole lot worse than some of the unloved apparel retail companies such as (but not just) Kohl's. When it comes to valuation (EV/EBITDA), here's what we know: Presently, Apple trades at 4.9x TTM (trailing twelve months) EV/EBITDA. Remember, this takes into account all of the cash hoard. This number is slightly deceiving, though - because in the latest reported quarter Apple's EBITDA was falling at a 20% year-on-year rate, but in the preceding 3 quarters it wasn't yet under the effect of the iPhone 6s underperformance. Presently, Kohl's trades at 4.3x TTM (trailing twelve months) EV/EBITDA. Granted, Kohl's EBITDA was also falling at a 20% year-on-year rate in the latest reported quarter. Thus, not only is Apple shrinking a whole lot more than the unloved Kohl's, but it's also more expensive if measured through EV/EBITDA. Obviously, EV/EBITDA is not the only multiple we can use to evaluate these two companies. We could also evaluate both from a FCF (Free Cash Flow) perspective. As a proxy for FCF, we can use (EBITDA-capex). Apple does have one advantage versus most of the other companies out there - it spends preciously little on capex. Let's see how Apple would do in terms of EV/(EBITDA-capex): Presently, Apple trades at 5.8x TTM (trailing twelve months) EV/(EBITDA-capex). This multiple is so close to the EV/EBITDA multiple because over the last twelve months, Apple generated ~$78.5 billion in EBITDA, but spent only ~$11.6 billion in capex. It spent just 14.8% of its EBITDA in capex. Presently, Kohl's trades at 5.9x TTM (trailing twelve months) EV/(EBITDA-capex). Here, Kohl's loses its valuation advantage to Apple. It's not that Kohl's spent tremendously in capex, but it still spent quite a bit more than Apple. It spent 27.7% of its EBITDA in capex, nearly double what Apple spent. It could be argued that this very low FCF multiple is what's probably attracting one of Warren Buffett's investment managers towards Apple (along with its strong brand). Still, what can we conclude from this exercise? We can conclude: Apple is shrinking faster than even an unloved retail name like Kohl's. If Apple doesn't significantly slow down this shrinkage, at some point Apple will stop being cheap. Arguably, the shrinkage is so fast that Apple deserves a valuation discount versus even unloved names like Kohl's. On some valuation measures like EV/EBITDA, Apple still appears more expensive than Kohl's - in spite of shrinking at a much faster rate. The one redeeming Apple feature is that it spends so little on capex that it generates monstrous FCF. Thus, while being more expensive on other measures, it's actually as cheap or cheaper thank Kohl's (and other names) when it comes to FCF multiples. On the whole, both Kohl's and Apple show extremely low valuation multiples, especially when it comes to FCF. However, Apple's quick revenue shrinkage is more troubling than Kohl's. That said, Apple's high-margin business offers it a measure of reprieve which Kohl's does not enjoy (I might write about this phenomenon in an article of its own). All in all, the sentiment towards Apple seems quite a bit more positive than the sentiment towards retail names like Kohl's. However, if we delve into both companies, Apple doesn't seem materially cheaper and its shrinkage greatly exceeds Kohl's.
