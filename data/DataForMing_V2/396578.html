Skyworks: Supplying All Sides In The Smartphone War - Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) | Seeking Alpha Skyworks stock dropped after the company's Q2 earnings report. Revenue and earnings met expectations, Q3 guidance was light. The market is yet again punishing Skyworks for its Apple association. But Skyworks is much more than just an Apple supplier. Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ: SWKS ) reported Q2 earnings on Friday in a quarter that many investors, including myself, expected to be to be tainted by the weakness of Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPhone 6 sales. Apple is Skyworks largest customer, so it's no surprise that Apple's results negatively affected Skyworks guidance for Q3. In fact, Skyworks stated: During the June quarter we expect to be impacted by an inventory adjustment at a large customer, partially offset with gains across broad markets and crisp operational execution. However, Skyworks' results also proved yet again that it is diversifying its revenue beyond Apple very successfully. And yet, the market still treats Skyworks as if it is a one-trick pony supplier. My fellow Seeking Alpha contributor SevenSeas Investment Research penned an article a few months ago on Skyworks, which referred to this line of thinking as the "Guilty by Apple Association" thesis. The article is well-written and highly informative, and can be found here . Regardless of my or your opinion on the matter, SWKS dropped about 7% after its Q2 results were released. The drop just adds more depth to the price decline the stock has experienced over the past 12 months: Down 32% over the past year and down 42% from its 52-week high, SWKS has disappointed investors mightily. Yet while investors are surely disappointed with the stock's performance, Skyworks the company has been chugging along smoothly. For the quarter, Skyworks' revenue was $775 million, up just 2% year-over-year ("YoY"), and EPS was $1.25 up 9% YoY. The main reason for the 7% gap between top and bottom line growth was the expansion of gross margin from 47% a year ago to 51% in Q2. Growth was relatively restrained in the quarter, and Q3 is expected to be worse. Skyworks expects Q3 revenue of $750 million and EPS of $1.21, which represents a 7% decline in YoY revenue and a 9% decline in EPS. As is evidenced in the previous quote, Apple's soft outlook and inventory adjustment for its iPhone are the likely culprit behind Skyworks' stunted growth expectations. Well this might lead you to ask the following question: if Guilty by Apple Association is a fallacy then why is Skyworks seeing significant adverse effects from Apple's woes? Because in the short term, Skyworks quarter to quarter revenue and earnings do rely on Apple revenues. However, Skyworks' earnings from Apple have provided a stepping stone for the company to secure a foothold in the radio frequency market at large. In Q2, Skyworks reported exciting design wins with major smartphone manufacturers and other companies. Some of the highlights were multiple solutions for Huawei's P9 smartphone, an increase in solutions provided for the Samsung Galaxy S7, and many more. The full list can be seen by taking a look at the Q2 earnings report. Huawei is now the third-largest smartphone manufacturer in the world, and sees 30%-plus annual growth in 2016. Huawei also made the ambitious prediction that it would surpass Apple in smartphone sales by 2019 and Samsung by 2021. Considering the company sold 125 million fewer phones than Apple and 218 million fewer phones than Samsung in 2015, it certainly has a long way to go. Regardless, Skyworks will reap the benefits of Huawei's push to surpass Apple and Samsung. In the China market as a whole, Huawei will soon be at the top. The following chart from IDC shows smartphone market share in China: Xiaomi currently has a slim lead in the market share department, but in the IDC report that contained this graph it is also noted that, while in 2015 Xiaomi shipped 2 million more smartphones than Huawei, in the fourth quarter of 2015 Huawei shipped 1 million more than Xiaomi. When you factor in that Xiaomi only saw 17% shipment growth in 2015 while Huawei saw more than 50% growth, it is likely that China will have a new smartphone leader by the end of 2016. Skyworks currently supplies RF solutions for Samsung, Apple, Huawei, Lenovo, Xiaomi (the top 5 smartphone manufacturers in the world) and more. Some place more supply orders than others, and some provide more revenue than others, but Skyworks is by no means a one-trick pony. The market has yet to realize it, but Guilty by Apple Association is a flawed argument that will prevent some investors from succeeding with SWKS. Skyworks earned EPS of $1.60 in Q1, $1.25 in Q2 for a total of $2.85, which is an 18% gain over earnings for the first half of 2015. If the company is supposedly so reliant on Apple's iPhone for revenue, it seems impossible that earnings rose in the first half of 2016 despite much weaker iPhone sales in that time span than the first half of 2015. From a valuation perspective, if we use Skyworks' first half of 2016 earnings of $2.85, Q3 guidance of $1.21, and assume for simplicity that Q4 earnings will be $1.20, which is very conservative considering the iPhone 7 is expected to launch during the quarter, that would give Skyworks full-year 2016 EPS of $5.20. This yields a lowly forward P/E of just 12.8. FY2016 EPS will likely be higher than $5.20 considering my estimate for Q4, but even using a very unlikely conservative estimate, the stock still looks really cheap at current levels. I will likely add to my long position in SWKS during this coming week and expect the stock to recover over the next couple of months. What do you think about Skyworks' revenue streams? Are they diversified enough? Should the company spend more capital on expanding its customer base? Feel free to leave a one-word answer or a long-winded tirade in the comments section below.
