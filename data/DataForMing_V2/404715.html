Disney earnings: $147M charge to shutter videogame unit - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha May 10 2016, 17:08 ET | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS ) is now down 6.6% after hours as its earnings call gets under way. Along with its earnings miss , the company is shuttering its videogame publishing unit . Revenues in Consumer Products and Interactive Media, a division which the company merged last year, had fallen 2% this quarter to $1.19B. The company launched Infinity in summer 2013, following on success by Activision Blizzard and its Skylanders toys-to-life products, and promised to fill it with buyable characters from Disney animation, Star Wars and Marvel properties. Updated: Disney says it will still release playsets/characters for Alice Through the Looking Glass and Finding Dory later this month and in June. I don't think you are wrong in being short. But someone on here needs to explain the currency rationale. The dollar has been weak, not strong. Everyone on here seems to misunderstand that. That trend *seems* to be reversing. So if a weak dollar has been hurting Disney, then a stronger dollar should help them. I am sure that everyone on here will say that a strong dollar hurts U.S large cap companies. But Disney had no issues rising when the USD was climbing the last few years. So....? I sold May weekly calls against the position with $110 strikes earlier today rather then short it before the report. Not a piggy. That means it only the Infinity brand and not the Interactive Division as well (Comcast really have messed up CNBC).Any way Iger needs to fire Potato and replace him with a competent Divisional-CEO who can acquire great development studios and beef up their Gaming Business (take a cue from TWX's WB Interactive Entetainment) tap into the family's Marvel properties a Spidey Game or Iron Man could do a lot of $$$ like Batman Arkham franchise and DCUO. Has anyone actually listened to the conference call.  DIS just recorded it's best quarter in the history of the company.  Shorts will be shaken out quickly and painfully. or it guess CNBC is actually right for second time because IGN and Variety says they are selling the Interactive Division as well.Well it leaves them with 3 Division Now.
