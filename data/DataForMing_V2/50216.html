Intel May Buy Altera: Does An Acquisition Even Make Sense? - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel reportedly offered to buy Altera for $54 a share. If an acquisition were to occur, there could be cost synergies through higher utilization of older fabs and reduction in overlapping costs. Despite the cost synergies, it's not exactly clear whether FPGAs are going to generate enough growth to merit the acquisition premium. If Intel were to acquire Altera, there's the potential for value destruction. Despite that reality, Intel's other business units will absorb the downside from over-paying. The reports of an Altera (NASDAQ: ALTR ) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) merger are a little unsettling, so I decided to do additional research on the topic, as I believe the two companies could have some synergies. Admittedly, I don't know everything about field programmable gate arrays, other than the fact that they're very useful and reprogrammable via a hardware design language, or HDL for short. There's a decent likelihood that these reports are accurate, however, the upside from such a deal isn't exactly clear. Intel is in the CPU and GPU business and it tends to stay away from FPGAs. The addition of FPGAs gives the combined company a separate line-up of ICs to market and sell. Admittedly, developing the kind of capabilities in-house would cost a lot of money and would take a lot of time. Hence, Intel seems willing to pay $54 (a premium) to buy out Altera. On the one hand, the deal on the table sounds pretty generous. Despite the generous offer, Altera had refused the deal earlier in the year, according to earlier reports. This has resulted in quite a bit of controversy, especially from institutional investors who wanted the immediate exit plan. Intel Corp is in talks to buy fellow chipmaker Altera Corp in a deal likely to top $10 billion, according to a source familiar with the matter, making it Intel's biggest purchase ever and the latest merger in the quickly consolidating semiconductor sector. The acquisition of Altera, which makes programmable chips widely used in cellphone towers, the military and other industrial applications, would underscore Intel Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich's determination to expand into new markets as the personal computer industry loses steam. The deal could be sensible for Intel shareholders. While it will take a while to make the deal accretive, there's potential to create value post-acquisition. Intel would obviously have to explain to shareholders how it will go about accomplishing this. But in the meantime, I'm going to try and make a couple educated guesses. Altera's FPGAs tend to win designs at the older process nodes. So, my guess is that the cost to performance is maximized on older manufacturing technology, which is why Intel is so worked up over the deal because it gives some of its older fabs higher utilization rates. This will lead to better rates of profitability due to higher gross margins. So Intel could potentially increase the gross margin and operating margins of Altera. It also may have a way of bundling FPGAs with its server-class CPUs, so it gives enterprise users more customizability with their data centers. Admittedly, these are all very hypothetical situations. When working off of consensus analyst estimates, Altera is expected to report a decline in EPS of around 18%. With a forward EPS of $1.25, the buyout price of $54 implies a forward price earnings multiple of 43.2. It's not clear whether Intel is going to generate enough value from this deal to merit the high valuation that it's going to pay. Prior to news reports of Intel's interest in acquiring Altera, the median sell-side research price target was $37 with the majority of price targets between $35 and $43. In a levered share repurchase scenario, we believe the company is worth ~$40 to ~$45 per share. Given the deep cyclicality of the semiconductor industry and the need for a strong balance sheet throughout the cycle, we believe it is unlikely that a levered share repurchase would ultimately be executed. As it relates to prospective revenues from Stratix 10, we are optimistic that Altera will benefit considerably over the next few years as on-die FPGA volumes begin to significantly penetrate Intel server volumes but, adjusted for risk and time value, we do not see this opportunity contributing more than $2-5 per share of incremental value even in our more optimistic models for Altera. Prior to learning of the disappointing Q1 earnings results and guidance, we viewed a standalone valuation range of $40 to $43 as appropriate for the Company. - TIG Capital While I'm still optimistic on Intel, I don't see this deal moving the stock by much. Intel may be overpaying as Altera in isolation isn't going to generate enough organic growth to start being accretive for perhaps five years, as the three-year target price is mid-$40s, based on various commentary from sell-side research firms. Also, growth is heavily dependent on the business cycle and on new technological developments, which have yet to be identified. For example, FPGAs are extremely useful because modifications to the hardware design language allows for high efficiency in narrow uses cases. While, FPGAs are useful, there's no indication that Altera is the most dominant in that market as there are competing providers like Xilinx (NASDAQ: XLNX ) and Samsung (OTC: SSNLF ). Then there's also the fact that data centers primarily revolve around general purpose computing. So in narrow use cases the FPGA does become pretty useful, but the cost-to-benefit isn't simply there for multi-purpose applications. Therefore, Intel is making an investment into a nascent business opportunity. I'm all for these types of acquisitions, but the return on investment isn't very well defined. Intel investors should be wondering if this is the best path forward as Intel could use $10 billion on share buybacks instead. If in the event Intel were to acquire Altera, I would still recommend the stock, but that's because its growth opportunity in storage, mobile and data centers offsets the potential downside from engaging in this acquisition.
