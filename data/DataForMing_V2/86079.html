Movado Group: No Dent In Growth Prospects - Movado Group, Inc. (NYSE:MOV) | Seeking Alpha Stock price has declined due to margin reductions, quarterly revenue decline and the threat from Apple Watch. Margin declines are expected to reverse, as these have come due to foreign currency fluctuations and one-off efficiency enhancement program expenses. Movado Group, Inc. (NYSE: MOV ) designs, sources, market and distributes fine watches under Concord, Ebel, Suderia Ferrari Watches and other brands. The company is one of the biggest players in its industry. With its diverse product range and a strong balance sheet, MOV has successfully followed the strategy of growing in the fashion watch category. MOV's 3-year average growth has been 7.8 percent against the industry average of 5.9 percent. 3-year average net income has been 17.4 percent against the industry average of -12.3 percent. From these figures, it is easy to see that MOV has been a star performer in the luxury watch category of luxury goods industry Recently, the company's stock has come under heat as it missed the latest quarterly earnings expectations (EPS) by $ 0.1 and revenue growth was reported slightly below same-quarter figures last year. Plus, MOV has been reporting margin reductions for the past few periods. Operating margin has declined from 17.68 percent to 5.71 percent during the last few quarters. There are also concerns about the direct impact of Apple's entry into the watch category. In the wake of these developments, MOV's share price has been under pressure especially since the last quarterly results. My thesis is that margin reductions, the impact from Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) entry into the market and other concerns (discussed below) are not serious enough to cause a permanent decrease in the value of MOV's growth opportunities. The impact of Apple's entry on traditional watch business has been generally over-estimated. Apple has a history of entering in a new market and transforming/redefining the product in terms of design and technology, thus reinventing the entire category. In case of smart watches, Apple has done this again with the smart watch. By transforming the product and making it a pinnacle of technological achievement in wearables, Apple has created a new market/category. The improvements of 'smart' watches over traditional watches make them a new must-have life enhancing gadget, and not a replacement of traditional watches. This is why companies in the business of traditional watches are not likely to see their sales eaten away by smart watch makers. Apple Watch has expanded the size of luxury watch market, instead of taking place of traditional watches. To restate, MOV has reported 3-year average revenue growth of 7.8 percent against the luxury goods industry average of 5.9 percent. The latest quarterly revenue decline is not material enough to be construed as a signal of rapid sales declines in the future. Margins have decreased, but this should not be considered sticky. The primary drivers of margin decreases has been the unfavorable impacts of foreign currency translation losses and MOV's latest operating efficiencies initiative. A rising dollar against foreign currencies and non-sticky expenses for operating efficiency enhancement should not be construed as part of the business in the long term. In this sense we can discount most of the latest margin reductions by MOV. Once the operating efficiency initiative enters post-implementation, and foreign currency fluctuations average out, investors should expect margins to increase in the next two to four quarters. This eases out MOV's future profitability concerns. MOV has no outstanding debt and a large cash accumulation. Total cash represents 34.2 percent of total assets, most of which have been financed through internally generated equity. In this sense, MOV has enough financial muscle and flexibility to finance its growth plans and sustain its dividend stream. MOV's growth prospects do not look marred by the latest profitability glitches and the entry of Apple Watch. The latest downward rally after the quarterly results has made MOV available at a discount. P/S ratio is 1.2 against the luxury goods industry average of 2.1. This combined with the growth prospects and expected margin improvements makes MOV a compelling growth case.
