Microsoft And The Phony Cloud Price Hike - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Media reports that cloud prices are rising are exaggerated. Fortune was gulled this week into doing a "Cost of Cloud Rising" story, probably by Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) public relations. I say gulled because the price of cloud is not rising, if by cloud you mean the raw rental of capacity at Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ) or another infrastructure provider. What Fortune is talking about, when it says cloud prices are rising, are two things. First, prices in other countries adjust along with currencies. If the Euro or the Yen is down, then the cost of something priced in dollars goes up. Second, Microsoft is "hiking prices" only on its Platform as a Service, which includes software authoring tools, and on its software. There are always three components or levels to what a customer may see as a cloud's price. Most people, when they talk about cloud costs, are talking about the "bare iron" price of using the infrastructure. Amazon.com has set that price for some time. Those who like it love it , and competitors were forced long ago to match it. Those prices are not rising. In fact they continue to fall. If you add development tools to a cloud, you're selling a cloud platform. Cloud Foundry is a cloud platform. Having the tools with which to create cloud solutions is a very good thing. Microsoft supports Cloud Foundry as well as its own tools. Then there the things clouds do. This can be called Software as a Service, or Service as a Service, or Applications as a Service. I think it's best to call these things Cloud Services. Cloud Services can be fairly simple and straightforward, like Office 365 or the Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iCloud, replicating what a PC does. Or they can be very complex, as with Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM ) or WorkDay (NYSE: WDAY ), replicating what an old client-server system did. This complexity can, to a great extent, make the infrastructure cost of a cloud seem irrelevant, which is why OpenStack, the open source cloud system, remains highly relevant in this market. You can build your own OpenStack cloud and connect it to a public cloud, which is called a hybrid cloud. So let's review. There are several levels to the cloud stack, with infrastructure at the bottom, platforms in the middle and services or software at the top. The aim of cloud providers, like Microsoft, is to use what's on the lower levels to create lock-in at the upper levels, and lock-in what it can start to charge for the service. But that's quite different from saying "cloud prices are going up." Software prices are going up. As software grows in complexity and capability, its cost is bound to go up, because software is still made by hand and people cost money, money that can't always be recouped by scaling the services and spreading the cost among more customers. What's happening here, or what Microsoft wants you to believe is happening here, is that software is creating lock-in, and lock-in is creating profits. If you believe that, buy Microsoft stock ahead of earnings. Source: Microsoft And The Phony Cloud Price Hike Disclosure: I am/we are long AMZN, AAPL.
