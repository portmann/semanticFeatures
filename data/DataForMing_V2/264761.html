Yahoo Japan said it offered to take over travel website Ikyu Corp for around 100 billion yen ($828 million), as the Japan-based e-commerce company aims to expand its travel and restaurant reservation business. Yahoo Japan, owned 35.5 percent by Yahoo Inc and 36.4 percent by SoftBank Group, said in a statement it offered 3,433 yen per share for Ikyu, a premium of around 42 percent to its close earlier on Tuesday. The move comes as the U.S.-based Yahoo Inc is considering what to do with its stake in Yahoo Japan, worth about $8.5 billion at current exchange rates. Yahoo Inc shelved plans to spin off its stake in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd on Wednesday, under pressure from activist investors worried about tax payments, and said instead it is looking at creating a separate company to hold the rest of its assets.
