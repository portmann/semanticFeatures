Apple Watch: Already A Lost Leader - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple Watch has limited if any unique characteristics that existing products don't already provide from Apple. The tethered Apple Watch finds sales limited based on distribution gains. Distribution gains more than doubled, but sales only grew 5% with competing products growing 70%. Apple is more than a products company but products make up the bulk of revenues and profits so products must be understood for their potential. In a recent article I authored, the subject matter surrounding my perspective on the Apple Watch (NASDAQ: AAPL ) raised a great deal of attention and... well most of it was negative and from the "Apple faithfu.l" The article was titled to convey a concern with regard to the Apple investor community and their reliance upon certain aspects of Apple's ability to maintain growth, in part, through the Apple Watch. " Apple's Watch Presents Less Potential Than Investors Think " is an article dedicated to the Apple Watch and serves to evoke consideration as to why or why not this particular product line will serve Apple well longer term. Through this article, I expressed my considerations on the subject matter. To the heart of the matter, the Apple Watch does not carry the necessary features of a product/product line that exhibits long-term growth and profitability. On another note, my general products of choice for respective categories like music, computing and communication are all Apple products. I'm using a MacBook to communicate this article and my smartphone is an iPhone 6. Additionally, I have an iPod Nano for my physical fitness related activitiesâ€¦gotta have my music with me during a workout session or 5K run. I've always been an Apple fan and proponent of the business model. But within these disclosures, this does not exonerate me from my duties as a research analyst and consultant to institutional investors, media outlets and dozens of companies participating in the retail and consumer goods industries. The Apple Watch is an attractive, viable, differentiated, serviceable and desirable product. Within all those adjectives, it is not something that any individual needs or will need in the future. "But you can't possibly see into the future Seth." Actually, to a good degree, that is what I get paid to do, model for future outcomes. Today, the Apple Watch is a tethered product in that it relies on the simultaneous ownership and proximity of a late model iPhone. That variable is a key factor in limiting the product's usefulness and overall appeal to the larger Apple and would-be Apple community. Having recognized this key variable, it still doesn't explain the broader thesis of why the Apple Watch does not carry the necessary features of a product line that exhibits long-term growth and profitability. What does explain this thesis is the fact that the Apple Watch does not address or fix a societal problem? Furthermore, Apple Watch does not advance itself in terms of beneficial usage beyond its predecessor platform, the smartphone. While some may argue to the contrary of my assertions, they are unable to dispose these facts. Most every application associated with Watch is a duplication or slight variance of the iOS software on the iPhone. If it weren't for the dedicated fitness applications like heart rate monitoring, every application on your Apple Watch is available on the smartphone. In fact, the iPhone today has more application and communication features than the Apple Watch, validating the lack of usefulness thesis offered previously. Even on your iPhone there is an application to monitor your heart rate. The main push or marketing of wearables is the health and fitness aspect of usage and it is easier to wear than carry a smartphone. But then again there are many accessories that ease the problem of carrying a smartphone during fitness related activities. Unfortunately if you still don't desire to "wear your phone" through the use of an accessory, the Apple Watch makes it necessary for total applicable usage. You really don't have a choice in the matter. The Apple Watch is not an essential product - you have to want it. With that said there is a market for non-essential consumer goods and that total addressable market is 100% of the time less than that of an essential consumer goods total addressable market. The most obvious and glaring problem with the Apple Watch or wearables as a category is they have no must-have feature. For the most widely demonstrated usage of wearables being health and fitness, most every application is offered in the passive state of application. The user has to perform additional activities or tasks to benefit from the data tracking/monitoring. Many would call these additional activities "chores." This is just another reason that wearables have such an extraordinary attrition rate, around 50 percent. I've heard a lot of defending of the Apple Watch over the last several months during interactions with the institutional investor community. Keep in mind that the various institutions call upon Capital Ladder Advisory Group to look into the subject matter. We gather information, study the information, stress test and compare the information, acquire sales data at the POS and through distributors, perform consumer surveys and employ focus groups. Ultimately, we evaluate the data and issue our total analysis with consideration of future demand with givens like future iterations/improvements. In defending Apple's proclivity to outperform its peers with several industry disruptive products, here are some reasons the Apple Watch may not perform in kind. The Apple Watch is not an iPod. Pretty innocuous statement, but within that statement what I'm conveying is that it doesn't advance itself to the level of consumer benefit that the iPod did when it was introduced. The iPod offered something that was beneficial to consumers, thousands of songs in your pocket or on your person. That didn't exist before. Remember, everything the Apple Watch can do is already offered with the iPhone. With the iPad, this product compacted all the functions of a PC into a portable device. The iPhone is pretty portable and pretty compact and it isn't tethered to use with an additional product and at a price tag of $300 plus. The iPhone was a great "follow the leader" product from Apple - that is pretty undeniable. But within that was the follow with greater form and function and as such the iPhone became a dominant player. There simply isn't anything the Apple Watch can do that can't be done with other Apple devices and that is a huge dent in the argument that suggests one should look at past product cycles and attach similar expectations for Apple Watch. I assume Apple TV was issued the same type of defending from the Apple faithful and yet this particular product, not unlike the Apple Watch, exhibits a lesser consumer reception. Apple TV is nowhere near dominating or relevant based on the little relevance given to it from consumers and even Apple in its quarterly disseminations. In kind, how much relevance does Apple give to the Apple Watch in quarterly disseminations? The examples and evidence is all there for investors to consider. Nothing makes the Apple Watch unique. It's just not there. But early adopters are still worth a few billion in sales, aren't they? I don't discount early adopters, but that has nothing to do with longevity of a product in the marketplace. Do you want to be relying on Apple Watch post the early adopter period as an investor? Keep in mind Apple has found less than half of its users have upgraded to the iPhone 6. It's really difficult to find that the company will be able to get even existing customers to not only upgrade, but to add a $300-plus purchase to the upgrade cycle. That's just logic folks! All analysts model with respect to iterations, newer versions of existing goods. Unfortunately, iterations for Apple Watch will need to be significant and groundbreaking. While achievable for Apple, it is unadvisable. Such improvements that are ground breaking will likely come at the expense of the consumer's wallet. Faster processors, more communication applications, photography and such are not meaningful to consumers with regard to an Apple Watch. I suggested that iterations of a groundbreaking magnitude for the Apple Watch is not advisable because such technological feats will likely price the product out of the mainstream and possibly erode some of the brand image. I've advised, witnessed and forecasted an exact likeness of circumstance in the past with regard to Keurig Green Mountain (NASDAQ: GMCR ) and Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO ). For those readers who are familiar with my coverage of the CPG industry, you know of which I'm referring. In 2014, Coca-Cola and Keurig partnered to the extent of Coca-Cola investing billions of dollars into Keurig and the development of the Keurig Kold. As a consultant, I advised Keurig not to push forward with the project back in 2012 and through 2013. Essentially the end product would come to be a technological breakthrough, but within that breakthrough was an extreme cost to the consumer and a severe lacking of efficacy the product could not overcome. With a significant engineering and fluid dynamics background, I understood this product could never achieve the level of sales that existing Keurig products have achieved on the hot platform. My advice went unrecognized and un-adopted by the parties, but well reported and in dozens of dedicated articles here on Seeking Alpha. One such article was written in September of 2015 titled " The Keurig Kold Folly Will End Badly For Many ." It did end badly with a forced sale of Keurig Green Mountain assets that enabled Coca-Cola to get out of a nearly $2bn investment ditch dug by Keurig Green Mountain. But many shareholders lost millions of dollars during the GMCR share price erosion from $137 to $45. I also had forecasted a buyout of Keurig during my analytical duties related to Keurig. I believed $45 to represent the true valuation of the company and held that belief as a price target for 12 months. I have maintained a $45 price target objective on shares of Keurig Green Mountain since December of 2014 and in the face of uncommonly misguided analysts' estimates and forecasts for the Keurig Green Mountain business. With my price target now achieved, and in accordance with my belief that the company needs to disclose greater insights into the business for FY16, I will be removing the consideration of share price targets in favor of such dissemination from Keurig executives. Having said that, I believe the Keurig business will continue to exhibit pressure along its differentiated sales channels that include brewer and K-cup sales for the in-home and away-from-home business segments. From 2013-2015, I authored probably 50 or so Keurig and Keurig Kold related articles with great detail and great warnings for investors to consider in their due diligence. In 2015, shares of GMCR plunged from a peak of $152 to my downside price target objective of $45. In short, what I was able to identify with Keurig Green Mountain was the total addressable market for Keurig products as well as the impact on the total business through ill-conceived product development cycles. Sometimes, there are better ways to spend money on R&D. I'm of the viewpoint that Apple should heed this example by two conglomerates in their respective industries with similar product efficacy issues and focus greater resources on more purposeful products. The Apple Watch is great, if you want it and can afford the attachment price tag. I've enjoyed reading Mark Hibben publications on Apple over the last few years. He has great technological experience and expertise. He has a great affinity for Apple Inc. and their technologies that often pervades itself in optimism for the business as a whole. But who can blame him as the company has a strong history of success and leadership. Then there are the undeniable results that Mr. Hibben is able to forecast within a reasonable margin of accuracy and detail. These are all great aspects of Mr. Hibben's coverage here on Seeking Alpha. So when I offer the following please recognize the difference between an author like Mr. Hibben and an author such as myself who has a greater focus on retail, produts and the consumer. With regard to Mr. Hibben's disseminations on Apple Watch, I'm of the opinion he is missing some aspects of understanding its potential. This is just my opinion and with great respect to Mr. Hibben being offered. In order to better juxtapose my views of the Apple Watch with Mr. Hibben I will offer some of his quotes in publication followed by my thoughts on said quotes. Most importantly, the Apple Watch is only going to get better with each succeeding generation. Following Apple's usual practice, succeeding generations will be sleeker, be able to do more, and have better battery life. As Apple adds value to the device, I expect sales to increase. I agree that future iterations will be better than the previous. That goes without saying and the general purpose of "next gens." But none of these iterations will offset the fact that there is no unique feature that isn't already available on an existing Apple device. So why can't Apple make device-specific features for the Apple Watch and features of added value? They can, but they shouldn't. Remember, Apple has set a poor example already that is limiting sales by tethering the product, but nonetheless, it is a standard. Additionally, Apple exhibits difficulty getting existing users to upgrade their iPhone until necessary. Lastly, Mr. Hibben offers an expectation of sales to increase by way of new iterations. That's kind of disingenuous to offer for a product only available in 12,000 stores presently and especially since Apple doesn't disseminate sell-through numbers and can see peak distribution around 80,000 stores. Most investors or readers won't be able to determine if iterations are a driver of increased sales or advancing distribution is the driver and sell-in is always larger than sell-through. Apple's product strategy with Apple Watch is something Apple bears still don't get. The bears tend to focus on the fate of iPhone, but don't realize that Apple already has an iPhone successor in Watch. With Watch providing the most important communications functions, the main function of the smartphone/tablet is going to be to provide a larger viewing area (as well as provide communications relay in the background). Consumers will just choose whatever screen size device that fits their needs. That's hardly fair and suggests that bears have an inferior way of analyzing the product's potential. Is there a reason that any of the verbiage expressed in this article hasn't presented itself before in Mr. Hibben's considerable coverage? He recognizes that smart watches are wearables, but has never uttered the words attrition rate with regard to wearables or attached any perspective on how the attrition rate relates to the usefulness of wearables/smart watches. Paint me a complete picture so that I can view all angles rather than position the pros with limited analysis of the impact on the business from the cons. The Apple Watch being the successor to the iPhone is hard to imagine for those who use voice command or type on the customary screen sizes associated with smartphones. The practicality of offering the Watch as a successor to a smartphone just doesn't hold water in my opinion. You just can't use voice command at all times to communicate and you will certainly have difficulty typing on a smart watch. So add all the communication features you want, but the limited screen size is just that, limiting. As advances are achieved in processors, communications technology, and batteries, the Watch will be able to be self-sufficient in communications, so that tethering to an iPhone will not be necessary. This is still a few years (at least) in the future, but Apple's positioning of the Watch anticipates this future. Like I offered, I'm all for untethering with the right technology that doesn't increase the price tag, but I think many would acknowledge that feat of strength may not be achievable. And for what, a device that still doesn't solve the limiting of effective communication due to the size of the screen associated with smart watches? Keurig Green Mountain went down this road and the term vaporware is often tagged to such erroneous endeavors. Rumors to the effect that Apple Watch would get some form of update on its anniversary have been floating around for some time. These rumors will undoubtedly gain momentum now that the price cutting (of about $100) at retailers Target (NYSE: TGT ), Best Buy (NYSE: BBY ) and B&H has been noticed . Such price-cutting typically precedes a product refresh, as retailers clear out old channel inventory to make way for the new model. The problem I have with Mr. Hibben's assessment as being typical for product life cycles is because the key competition in the smart watch space hasn't taken any discounts ahead of their total wearables product line. Fitbit (NYSE: FIT ) is coming out with their new iterations and new smart watch, Blaze, in the coming weeks. Ahead of the product launches no retailers have been discounting the Fitbit products in any meaningful or unusual way. According to NPD Group weekly reported data (subscription needed), Fitbit's average selling price (ASP) has remained constant during this period of new product introduction. Secondly, when Apple products take discounts, it is usually because former iterations are still available for sale when new iterations are made available. In the case of wearables, former products have found themselves eliminated/discontinued. This is going to be a new wrinkle that Apple may find objectionable. There is no such thing as taking a good discount on goods as they all impact sales. It gets worse: "What is the top selling smart watch on Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ) presently?" The Fitbit Blaze. How bad do you really want the analysis to be so far as understanding the consumer and how important pricing is for wearables? The Blaze has one-fourth the functionality of the Apple Watch. The Blaze is so bad it defies comprehension and yet the price has elevated its status above that of the Apple Watch in identifiable, like sales channels. All of which validates the totality of my concerns and assertions for the Apple Watch. Tethered, pricing, efficacy, uniqueness and a non-essential consumer good. Don't' get me wrong - Fitbit faces the same problems! The Apple Watch is found wanting in a great many aspects and even Mr. Hibben has offered as much. The Apple Watch began with 5,000 locations in 32 countries and selling some 4.1mm units into the sales channel. But in the next quarter they grew locations to 12,000 and sold only 4.4mm units. This is a red flag if ever there was one. Apple more than doubled its distribution, but grew sales by only 5 percent. You don't need NPD Group POS sales data to understand that the sell-through is problematic for the Apple Watch, you really don't. It is not bewildering to understand why Apple is not discussing sell-through with the public and they really don't have to based on what we would expect from the numbers disseminated by Apple for sell-in data. For comparison sake in the wearables category, Fitbit sold 8.2mm units in the December quarter, up 70% sequentially. Based on the Fitbit rate of attrition, only 50% of initial purchases become active users. And I get it, believe me I get the whole health and wellness and insurer potential. I wrote about it and determined the value of it for Fitbit and other wearable investors to consider in an article . So it is not that I discount the value of the applicable usage of wearables, it's that I'm modeling the value based on all considerations necessary. Health and wellness - the media behaves as if they never heard of this before. It has been a focus for decades and yet we are more obese as a society than ever. But a wristband that doesn't actually fix a problem is the solution. Thanks for tracking my steps and monitoring my heart rate, now what? Investors should consider that while Apple is a strong company and offers more than just products, those products make up the bulk of the profits and revenues. As such, investors need to consider the forward-looking aspects of these products. Previous Apple products solved problems and improved upon existing products. The Apple Watch has yet to offer such advantages. When it comes to investing in Apple, I think the company offers a lot of long-term returns on capital for investors, but the interim has been called into question by a great many investors due to some of the newer products and their potential contribution to growth. I concede the focus on the interim may be of little consequence, but traders trade always. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.
