Amazon's True Intrinsic Value May Never Be Known - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Amazon's gross margin recently reached a record high, as the firm continues to focus on profit growth. The company's spending history, if repeated, however, could ultimately nullify its recently achieved record margins and profit improvements. Despite the concerns, the firm has a promising outlook. Revenue growth and operating income growth are expected to continue through the fiscal third quarter of 2015. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) has become the marquee destination for online shoppers, but there is more to the company than meets the eye. It is also becoming a leader in the cloud computing market. The firm continues to focus on taking market share, and the possibilities may be endless, for the foreseeable future, of course. Amazon's gross margin has improved recently due to dramatic success in Amazon Web Services (AWS), third-party seller unit growth, and lower shipping costs. A lot has been going on , and new products should prove to be great investments for the firm. Amazon Echo, a device designed entirely around the user's voice, has moved to general availability in the US. Customer response to Echo has been overwhelmingly positive, with over 16,000 5-star reviews and an average customer rating of 4.5 stars. Prime Day was also a resounding success. More new members tried Prime worldwide than on any single day in Amazon history, and customers purchased more units on Prime Day in 2015 than on Black Friday in 2014. Though the firm has made profit growth a high priority, Amazon's record margin and profit improvements could be short-lived if its spending history resurfaces in the future. The company is trading at high earnings multiples, and its fair value estimate is ultra-sensitive to normalized margin expectations. For example, we estimate that for each percentage point that we change with respect to our mid-cycle gross margin assumptions, Amazon's fair value estimate changes $50 per share. Its true intrinsic value may never be known - hence, the stock's significant volatility. Free cash flow should improve if investments turn out to be profitable, but the company remains a low-margin operation. Despite the concerns, Amazon has a promising outlook, and recent news that it has overtaken Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) as the largest retailer by market capitalization is quite something. Revenue growth is the highest it has been in three years, and gross margins are at a record high. Investors are on cloud nine, and the solid pace of revenue growth and operating income expansion are expected to continue into the fiscal third quarter of 2015. Amazon earns a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT, the highest possible mark on our scale. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders for the past few years, a track record we view very positively. Return on invested capital (excluding goodwill) has averaged 24.4% during the past three years. The firm operates as an online retailer. It seeks to be a customer-centric company for four primary customer sets: consumers, sellers, enterprises, and content creators. The company also provides advertising services and co-branded credit card agreements. The online retailer continues to focus on taking market share and damaging its competitors. Kindle Fire variants, tablets that sell for roughly breakeven, have been top-selling products on Amazon.com. Recent events, such as raising prices for Prime members, indicate that profit growth has become a higher priority. Amazon's cash flow generation is about what we'd expect from an average company in our coverage universe. However, should the company decide to turn off the spending gushers, its free cash flow would explode higher. The company's fair value estimate is ultra-sensitive to normalized margin expectations. In our opinion, the best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital. The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Amazon's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 24.4%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.6%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead, based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate. Firms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Amazon's free cash flow margin has averaged about 1.9% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively MEDIUM. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. At Amazon, cash flow from operations increased about 64% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 29% over the same time period. Through the first half of 2015, the company reported cash from operations of $498 million and capital expenditures of $2.1 billion, resulting in free cash outflow of $1.6 billion. This is the most important portion of our analysis. Below, we outline our valuation assumptions and derive a fair value estimate for shares. Our discounted cash flow model indicates that Amazon's shares are worth between $319 and $531 each. The shares are currently trading at ~$500, in the upper half of our fair value estimate. This indicates that we feel that there is more downside risk than upside potential associated with these shares. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's MEDIUM ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $425 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about -814.7 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 37.9 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 19.9% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 22.8%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 2.7%, which is above Amazon's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 6.9% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Amazon, we use a 10.6% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows. Our discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $425 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets, as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety, or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph above, we show this probable range of fair values for Amazon. We think the firm is attractive below $319 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $531 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion. We estimate Amazon's fair value at this point in time to be about $425 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart above compares the firm's current share price with the path of Amazon's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $578 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $425 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range. Amazon clearly has potential. The online retailer has finally turned the corner with respect to a renewed focus on profitability, but the company's fair value estimate remains sensitive to normalized margin assumptions, in our view. Throughout most of its history, Amazon has seemed content with simply growing revenue and creating new products, but if recent investments continue to gain steam, free cash flow generation could pave the way for significant economic value creation. Though we like the recent focus on the bottom line, the company will always remain of the low-margin variety, and that means it will always have tremendous earnings leverage - and with tremendous earnings leverage comes significant sensitivity to mid-cycle assumptions and a large range of fair value outcomes. Given the incredible difficulty in forecasting its true intrinsic value, we doubt the firm will ever meet the criteria to be included in the newsletter portfolios.
