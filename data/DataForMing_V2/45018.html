Search deal with Mozilla and restructure partnership with Microsoft will increase revenues going forward. New mobile search app can help the company compete with Google to be indispensible to digital information. Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) released its most recent earnings report on April 21st, in which it missed market estimates for both sales and profits. CEO Marissa Mayer has been emphasizing the company's strategic imperatives, which revolve around mobile technology. The new focus on the company is showing considerable growth and potential, but has not yet been able to turn the Yahoo's fortunes around. While the company's core valuation is still extremely cheap when taking into account its assets, as analysts have covered extensively, investors are still worried by the lack of progress in revenue growth. But Mayer teased investors with the possibility of returning more value to shareholders, buying herself time as she attempts to challenge in the mobile search market and for the mobile first strategy to begin driving revenue growth. Mayer has previously been able to buy herself time to carry out the transformation of the company by returning value to shareholders, such as the tax-free spin off of the company's remaining shares in Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ). Worth approximately $31.5 billion, the announced spin off is on schedule to take place during the fourth quarter of 2015, and has caused activist investors to give Mayer more space to carry out her plan. Now, she is floating the possibility of a similar transaction regarding Yahoo Japan Corp. ( OTCPK:YAHOF ), which has a market cap of roughly $24 billion. Yahoo's 35% stake in the company is worth more than $8 billion. During the earnings call, Mayer mentioned that the company had hired advisers to maximize the value of this stake, exploring all possibilities to return capital to investors. The return of capital is vital to the company right now, as revenue from Yahoo's legacy business has consistently fallen over the past few years. During that time, however, the stock price has been propped up by its stakes in the Asian companies, giving Mayer the time and financial flexibility to make the MaVeNS strategy, which is her shorthand for mobile, video, native, and social, viable. While this activity is transparent to shareholders, it works because of the success the company has had at carrying out the return of capital and cost cutting. Besides the planned spin off of Alibaba later this year, Yahoo has returned $9.4 billion to shareholders since Mayer was named CEO in 2012. This is well beyond any public commitments the company has made according to Mayer, and has reduced the company's share count by 22%. Besides the strong history of capital returns, Yahoo under Mayer has also done a good job of cutting away some of the fat of the company. In her two and half years as CEO, Mayer has closed 17 office locations, approximately 80 products that were underperforming or not key to the company, reduced the number of contractors by nearly 2,000, and reduced the full-time employee headcount by nearly 3,000. The cut costs, along with the return of capital to shareholders, has made the mobile-first transition possible, which will begin materially increasing profits in 2016. During Mayer's two and a half years as CEO, Yahoo's revenue from the MaVeNS businesses has grown from what was essentially nothing to more than $1 billion in annual revenue in 2014. The company has made acquisitions, including Tumblr, Flurry, and BrightRoll, that amount to $2.1 billion. This sounds like a large amount, but looks much more reasonable when taking the value the company has returned to shareholders over that time. While revenue from these businesses continues to grow, with Tumblr on its own on pace to record revenues of $1 billion a year eventually, there is still lots of progress to be made. Yahoo's share of search has continued to fall since Mayer took over. However, recent activity and a new future plan could turn this trend around. The most recent quarter was the first full one since Yahoo entered into an agreement with Mozilla to be its default search engine. The partnership increased volume and profitability in the search market for Yahoo, attracting new users and retaining them on Yahoo's services. Yahoo also restructured its partnership with Microsoft during the last quarter, giving it more flexibility. The new deal gives Yahoo more control over how search results are presented, as well as how to monetize those search results. More importantly, the new agreement also gives Yahoo the right to terminate the contract in June. These two deals should immediately increase revenues going forward. This is key as the company focuses in on becoming, as Mayer put it in the earnings call, to be an indispensible guide to digital information. Mayer, who built her reputation working on Google's search engine, has the experience needed to help the company do so. Instead of focusing on the traditional search model, such as Google, Yahoo will focus on a newer, more diversified field of search. This kind of search assistant will be more important in the future as search continues to shift away from desktops and more towards mobile. One example that Mayer gave during her earnings call was searching for JFK on the way to the airport. This new kind of search would be able to use the user's information to understand that they were on the way to the airport and would pull up their flight information, instead of pulling up information about the US president. The advanced search model will only grow to be more important in the future, as people perform their search needs using new devices such as televisions and watches. The possibilities of this newer field of search are vast, and Yahoo has the advantage of having a large amount of data about its users thanks to its legacy. There are rumors that Yahoo is already working on a pilot version of a mobile search app, which it plans to release during the second quarter. The algorithmic analysis for both the one-month and three-month forecasts for Yahoo is especially strong, as can be seen in the figure above. The three-month forecast is especially strong, with a signal strength of 72.11. This indicates that the algorithm believes that the stock price is in currently undervalued, which makes sense considering the company's stakes in both Alibaba and Yahoo Japan. With the potential further return of value to shareholders through a sale or spinoff of Yahoo Japan, the introduction of a new mobile search application, and strong algorithmic analysis, Yahoo is a good stock to invest in at the current price.
