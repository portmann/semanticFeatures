Apple targets shipping date for electric car for 2019: WSJ | Reuters Apple Inc (AAPL.O) has designated building an electric car as a "committed project" and has set a target shipping date for 2019, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. The project has been code-named Titan and its leaders have been given permission to triple the 600-person team, the WSJ said, citing people familiar with the matter. ( on.wsj.com/1NPb7Xr ) For Apple, a â€œship dateâ€? doesnâ€™t necessarily mean the date that customers receive a new product; it can also mean the date that engineers sign off on the productâ€™s main features, the WSJ said. Apple spent more than a year investigating the feasibility of an Apple-branded car, including meeting with two groups of government officials in California, according to the Journal. Sources told Reuters in August that Apple was developing a car and studying self-driving technology, but it was unclear if the iPhone maker was designing a vehicle that could drive itself. Apple was not immediately available for comment. The Cupertino, California-based company doesnâ€™t currently plan to make its first electric vehicle fully autonomous, WSJ said on Monday. Apple has been consistently hiring car experts as part of its effort to build a team in automated driving. Apple has hired this year Megan McClain, a former Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) engineer with expertise in automated driving, and Vinay Palakkode, a graduate researcher at Carnegie Mellon University, a hub of automated driving research. Apple also hired a senior engineer from electric car maker Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O), according to a LinkedIn posting.
