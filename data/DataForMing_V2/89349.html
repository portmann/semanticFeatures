The Intel Compute Stick Is Standing On The Shoulders Of 2 Giant PC Vendors - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Lenovo is the second major PC manufacturer this month to support the Intel Compute Stick product. Lenovo’s IdeaCenter PC stick might also use the same Cherry Trail Atom processor used by the Asus Pen Stick. Asus unveiled its Atom Cherry Trail-powered Pen Stick product earlier this month. The Asus Pen Stick is the world’s first Windows 10 computer-on-a-stick product. The world's biggest PC vendor, Lenovo (OTCPK: LNVGY ), joins Asustek (OTC: ASUUY ) as major backers of Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) Compute Stick product concept. The Bluetooth Special Interest Group's website confirmed that Lenovo has a PC stick product. This is a very important development that helps legitimize the HDMI stick form factor as a mainstream consumer-centric computer. Brad Linder of Liliputing speculated that the Lenovo IdeaCentre Stick 300 will also use the same older generation Bay Trail Atom Z3735 processor. However, judging from Asustek's own Pen Stick product , I am inclined to believe that Lenovo's upcoming PC stick will also come with the new Cherry Trail Atom X5 processor. The $150 Asus Pen Stick is the world's first Windows 10 PC-on-a-stick product and it is scheduled for commercial release on Q4 2015 . There is no official technical specs released yet but the competitive nature of Lenovo (that helped it become the world's top seller of desktop computers) says it is highly likely that Lenovo will also create a PC Stick product that is on par with the Asus Pen Stick's hardware specs. Using the latest Cherry Trail processor will help Lenovo come up with a fanless PC Stick. The original Intel Compute Stick has a small fan inside it because Intel likely found out that the Atom Z3735 processor needed it for better heat dissipation. Furthermore, Lenovo will want an Atom X5 processor because it has better GPU performance and wireless charging features . Tiny PC Sticks should not be used for heavy heat-generating 3D PC gaming. However, the Gen8 Intel HD graphics of Cherry Trail Atom X5/X7 processors support OpenCL 2.0 acceleration - which is also important for Photoshop and other Windows-specific productivity software users. Lenovo will have to release a Cherry Trail-powered, fanless version of its IdeaCentre Stick 300 product if it wants to attract the interest of highly-mobile creative professionals. The alleged $150 price tag of the Atom X5-equipped Asus Pen Stick computer product is also believable. A quick check on Intel's website revealed that Cherry Trail processors could be bought for as low as $20/tray. While this year's PC stick products will be limited to cheap Cherry Trail processors, Intel intends to put Core M processors inside Compute Stick products next year. Core M products are priced far higher than Cherry Trail Atom processors. Intel's plan for Compute Stick for next year is therefore a desirable move for all INTC investors. A Core M-powered Compute Stick (codenamed Cedar City) from Lenovo or Asustek could be a hit among demanding consumers/enterprise users. CPU-intensive industry standard software like Photoshop certainly benefits from the more robust compute capabilities of a Core M processor. Another important improvement for the next-gen Compute Stick is the inclusion of MHL support . The current HDMI Compute Stick products available today still use a micro-USB port/cable for power. Enabling MHL (Mobile High-Speed Link) support means the next PC Stick products will draw power directly from the HDTV port of a TV or a desktop monitor. The new superMHL standard is capable of charging mobile devices up to 40W and also has support for USB Type-C connection. INTC is a Buy . The Compute Stick concept can no longer be dismissed as a niche product. Lenovo and Asustek's support makes it mainstream merchandise for the global market. Lenovo and Asustek sold almost 19 million computers last Q1 2015. Lenovo and Asus clearly have the production capacity and global distribution channels to easily market 1 million Compute Sticks per month. The Lenovo and Asus global brands are also certainly more popular (and more trustworthy) than MeeGoPad or Mouse Computer m-Stick . Success breeds envy. Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ ), Dell, and Acer ( OTC:ASIYF ) might also come up with their own versions of the Compute Stick once Lenovo and Asus start getting decent sales from their PC Stick products. Dell already has an Android PC Stick product for enterprise users. However, the upcoming release of Windows 10 might inspire Dell to create a Windows version of its Wyse Cloud Connect PC Stick. Windows 10 now comes with much improved identity protection and data security features. Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
