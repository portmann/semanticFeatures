Why Apple Will Escape The $130 Resistance Level - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha I have revised my EPS forecast from $10.22 to $10.57 for FY 2015. I anticipate iPhone shipments to come in at 250.28 million units vs. my earlier estimates of 240.29 million units. Assuming back half iPhone volume does indeed surprise based on supply chain data, the stock will likely break above $134. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) started out the year with a strong rally only to be met by resistance in the mid 130s. I think the stock is worth substantially more than $134, and while that may be the case, the stock has yet to exhibit the kind of momentum necessary to move the stock price higher. Thankfully, the company has an extremely high probability of reporting a strong Q3 and Q4, which will allow the company to finish FY 2015 strong. I anticipate iPhone shipments to surprise estimates yet again and Apple Watch figures to meet my targets based on supply chain sources. Of course, the stock has been immune to good news, and anything good doesn't really seem good enough. Even so, following Q3 earnings, the stock should be able to break above the $134 resistance area. While broader market forces have kept the stock price pinned, I think the lack of momentum is temporary and that over the long haul fundamentals will eventually be reflected in the price of the stock. I'm raising my forecast to 54 million iPhone shipments for Q3 FY 2015, which implies that the company will undoubtedly beat on earnings. Apple sold 35.2 million units in the year ago period, so unit growth will be 53.4% year-over-year. That's much higher than the average growth of iPhone shipments for the first two quarters of the year. Therefore, my inputs may have been too conservative. Assuming Apple sustains 54% shipment growth for the next two quarters my price target would move higher by an additional $6. However, to stay conservative I'm going to maintain my price target because the stock will react to the positive news, but it won't move the valuation relative to the S&P 500. In other words, Apple will likely remain cheap in comparison to the broader market even if it were to move higher. Therefore, we have to assume a discount to the market regardless of what Apple is intrinsically worth. Assuming Apple is able to maintain this kind of momentum into the final quarter of the current fiscal year, the company will report revenue of $252.469 billion and basic EPS of $10.57. That's 4% above my revenue forecast for FY 2015. Therefore, the $9.02 consensus EPS estimate could be off by a fairly sizable magnitude, and since the stock price remains depressed Apple's share buyback program could prove to be more effective than what I had originally anticipated. Of course, broader market risks could drag the price of the stock lower or unexpected supply chain issues may limit the sell through of the iPhone 6. Typically volume tends to weaken during the fourth quarter because of pent-up demand for the next iPhone. So, if the next iPhone is really good, people might wait a couple more months before buying an iPhone. The stock has moved sideways following the announcement of Q2 earnings. Admittedly, there aren't many months left following the July announcement of earnings to reach my $194 price target. Even so, we've seen Apple move really quickly following the piercing of key resistance levels. Unlike other resistance areas, the $134 area hasn't really established itself as a major barrier and my guess is that the next move up will break past resistance. Also, some of you have been asking some really good questions as to why the stock is not rising faster. Personally, I wish I could offer an all-encompassing answer as to why markets are pricing the stock at a discount. It has been cheap for quite a while now, and while the company tends to go through cyclical periods of growth, next year's growth rate will likely surprise estimates. Therefore, the company should be trading at a much higher valuation. However, the negative forward-looking bias of other market professionals is perhaps the main reason why the stock isn't moving higher. Many are highly skeptical given the large base of revenues and earnings, and while the Apple Watch should add some momentum, the impact isn't going to be very meaningful for the foreseeable two years. Therefore, the growth story is heavily contingent on the iPhone. Therefore, Apple needs to unveil an outstanding iPhone 6S/7 at its September event, and second half earnings will need to be a blowout. Of course, the data does suggest that earnings will be a blowout, so there are ample catalysts to drive the stock price higher between now and the end of 2015. Quite frankly, no one really knows why Apple doesn't have a higher portfolio weighting among mutual fund and hedge fund managers given the outsized growth of the stock. Perhaps it's the lack of familiarity of the business model that detracts other fundamentally oriented investors who perhaps specialize or focus in other sectors not pertaining to technology. Also, there has been some profit taking lately, and some major investment firms are starting to reduce their allocation away from technology into financial, energy and consumer cyclical stocks. Despite the various factors that have weighed on the stock, I still stand by my earlier $194 price target. I'm fairly certain that the good outweighs the bad and going into the second half of the year momentum will drive the stock price even higher.
