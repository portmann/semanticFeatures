Apple Clobbers Samsung In China - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Samsung's 2015 Q2 earnings guidance indicates that the Galaxy S6 has not reversed the downward trajectory of Samsung's sales. In contrast, Apple appears poised to deliver another quarter of outstanding growth. Despite introducing the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge, Samsung (OTC: SSNLF ) appears to have failed to reverse its smartphone market share declines in 2015 Q2. Meanwhile, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is on track to post about a 40% y/y unit sales gain for iPhone. Samsung's recent guidance indicates an 8% y/y decline in revenue, while Apple's revenue for the June quarter may increase by about 30%. The different trajectories of these companies can be explained by their sales performance in China. In January of this year, after calendar 2014 Q4 earnings were released, I confidently declared Apple the victor in its smartphone war with Samsung. Some may have found this premature, and even I backed off somewhat from this in subsequent articles such as Apple's Samsung Problem . Not that I changed my fundamental view of the outcome of the battle, but I acknowledged that the Galaxy S6/Edge was a good phone, much improved by all accounts, that would win back some market share for Samsung in the near term. While Samsung's recent earnings guidance had some Apple fans taking victory laps , in fact Samsung did get a slight boost compared to calendar Q1. Sales (based on the guidance ) increased slightly by 2% q/q to $43 billion, while operating profit was up 15% to $6.1 billion. This has justifiably been characterized as a disappointment for Samsung, with the blame laid squarely on S6 sales performance. From my standpoint, it represented less damage than I expected the S6 to inflict in the short term. Apple fans can reasonably take heart from the news, but investors should now look beyond this for the lessons learned, especially about Apple's future prospects. Apple has clearly blunted the counter-attack of the S6 and is preparing to unleash its own in the form of the updated iPhone 6S. A number of factors probably have contributed to the continuing strength of the iPhone 6, but key among them is Apple's sales performance in China. In calendar Q1, Apple's revenue for Greater China grew by 71% year-over-year to $16.8 billion. The sales growth in China accounted for over 56% of Apple's total revenue growth for the quarter . Based on the expectations of prominent Apple analysts such as Katy Huberty and Steve Milunovich, Apple is likely to post another extraordinarily strong quarter. Expectations are for iPhone unit sales of better than 50 million and total revenue of about $48 billion. Clearly Apple is on a totally different trajectory than Samsung, with iPhone unit sales up over 40% y/y and total revenue up by over 28%, if these expectations are met. Kantar Worldpanel smartphone OS market share data indicates that most of this growth occurs in China. Kantar's data has become less quantitatively predictive since the beginning of the year, so I wouldn't extrapolate specific growth numbers from their data, as I have in the past. But I consider their results still good for estimating overall trends. Their data indicates that China is really the only growth area that matters for Apple, with a 46.26% unit sales growth for the three months ending in May compared to last year. Kantar's Carolina Milanesi also wrote a short article extolling the sales performance of Samsung in the U.S., which she claimed had regained the top spot for sales. But according to Kantar's own data, Apple's iPhone sales in the U.S. only declined by 5% from the previous year for the three-month period ending in May. So Samsung's market share gains, which Milanesi didn't quantify, are probably no compensation for Apple's market share gains in China. Kantar's U.S. data also may be a little suspect since it seems to be contradicted by Comscore usage share data for the same three-month period ending in May. The distinction between usage share and market share often gets lost: market share is percent of sales, usage share is percent of users. Nevertheless, increasing usage share while market share declines is a neat (and implausible) trick. The contrasting trajectories of Apple and Samsung I still believe speak to the fundamental business advantages of the Apple iOS ecosystem. As I and many others have pointed out, there's a fundamental difference in profitability between iOS and Android that Android phone makers have difficulty coping with. I've argued that this difference in profitability gives Apple a competitive advantage in that it can invest so much more in making its ecosystem more appealing to consumers. But the critical near-term question is why Apple is doing so well in China. Here I believe the answer must go beyond the usual "It's the ecosystem." It's more than that. Apple's Tim Cook appears to have adopted a very deliberate strategy to cultivate the Chinese market, and that strategy has worked. The elements of that strategy include: Additional efforts aimed at making iOS and Mac OS X easier for Chinese language users: Blogger Mark D. Mill , who has spent five years in China, pointed out the many upgrades at this year's WWDC aimed specifically at Chinese users. Apple's iOS has always offered developers good tools for language localization (swapping text labels in the app for local language variants), but Mill points out that this year Apple offered new ways to cope with the special challenges of the Chinese language. He concludes that this is driven by Apple's special interest in the Chinese market. Apple's retail presence in China: Apple's retail stores have become a textbook example of how to do brick and mortar in the age of the Internet. In January, Apple announced that it was opening five new stores by February and expanding the stores from 15 to 40 within two years. Angela Ahrendts appears to be the architect of Apple's retail strategy in China . Apple's Chinese retail stores confirm Apple as an aspirational brand in China. They also demonstrate the attributes of commitment and stability that consumers value. More than anything else, the stores help set Apple apart from the lot of Android commodity smartphones. The sting of the white box Android backlash: Previously, I've speculated that Apple was benefiting from a backlash against the poor quality of so called "white box" smartphones that typically run some form of Android. I believe that this has tainted consumers' view of Android in China, associating (perhaps unfairly) the operating system with the poor quality of the hardware. Tim Cook's frequent visits to China: An article in Business Insider last year pointed to the stark contrast in attitudes toward China between Steve Jobs and Tim Cook. Jobs never set foot in China whereas Cook is a frequent visitor. Cook has very constructively and personally engaged Chinese government and business leaders. We don't know the details of what's discussed, but we can see the results. Regulatory hurdles are overcome, business partnerships are forged, and the resulting growth is phenomenal. China will necessarily consume much of Apple's attention in the coming years, but already focus is shifting to new market opportunities in India and Latin America, where Apple's market share remains small, according to Kantar. In the three Latin American countries where Kantar provides data, Mexico, Brazil and Argentina, Apple's market share is highest in Mexico, at 6.4%. Apple will probably proceed as it has in China, building a retail presence, and perhaps a manufacturing presence. There's a lot of work to do. In all of Latin America, Apple has only two retail stores, both in Brazil. Apple has no retail stores in India. Between the geographic growth opportunities and the new product opportunities offered by Apple Watch, Apple Pay, Apple Music and possibly Apple Car, I think we're looking at an easy compound annual revenue growth rate of 15%. That doubles Apple's revenues in five years. Since Apple always is conscientious about maintaining margins, that means Apple's profit also doubles in the same period. While the market may continue to undervalue Apple, share price growth has tracked profit growth fairly closely, so I expect Apple shares at least to double in value over the next five years. Hopefully sooner, if the market wakes up to the fact that Apple's growth story is by no means over.
