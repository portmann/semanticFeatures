History Is On Your Side If You Decide To Own Netflix After The Split - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha According to empirical research, splits are indicative of stocks that are going to outperform. While the split doesn't impact the financial statement aside from the per share denominator over various financial figures. History is still on your side, as companies who have the luxury of splitting shares tend to outperform the market. Anyone who has followed me knows how much I like Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) and how much I believe in the underlying growth story. The company added fuel to the fire by announcing a 7:1 stock split effective July 14, 2015. The impact from the stock split has less to do with the income statement and more to do with psychology. In many cases stocks tend to move higher following a split, so there's confirmation bias. But, notwithstanding broader biases, I wanted to surface some arguments from academia. The stock price is reacting positively to the news. It's fairly obvious that the stock is in an upward trend, but could the momentum really continue? Source : Jones Graduate School of Management Generally speaking across a broad population sample, the mean performance of a stock following a split is 23.29% over the next 12-months, according to the above study. If we are to use the median, the implied upside is around 16.18% following the split. I'm going to go with the mean in this case, because Netflix is more of an outlier. Since it probably fits within the top quartile of distributed possibilities, there's a high likelihood that returns following the split will be in excess of 23.29%. When reading through the Jones academic paper, the two main factors that really stood out was the underlying characteristic of the stocks that were split, and the lag time for analysts looking to adjust their outward growth models at a bigger outstanding share base. These two factors imply that over the short-run market pricing can be inefficient (because analysts are slow to adjust financial models), and over the long haul, stock splits are a reaction to overwhelming momentum in the stock. My guess is that while the share split does little to do add or negate value from a financial context, it does add confirmation to the fact that top performing stocks tend to experience stock splits. So, if we average the performance of stocks that split shares, the next 12-months tend to be pretty good. So as long as the underlying fundamentals that drove the stock price higher continue to unfold. Well, in the case of Netflix, growth is starting to accelerate. In an age where Internet bandwidth is becoming increasingly more abundant and at lower cost, the advantages to OTT in comparison to linear television broadcast is driven by cost. Furthermore, the increasing base of subscribers makes it substantially easier for Netflix to fund its own in-house content, or buy content from third-party producers. In other words, Netflix can have just as much scale as the linear TV providers, which has a circular effect of furthering its own economic advantage in comparison to lower scale providers that have to charge more. Also, foreign markets have lower barriers of entry due to the falling cost of bandwidth, which expands the addressable market. Given the expansion of Netflix into foreign markets and improving profitability domestically, one can argue that Netflix is a growth stock and that the underlying business model is highly predictable. Because of the durability and non-cyclicality of earnings from this kind of business model, the valuation premium is trending higher. Also, the upside isn't capped, because it's highly unlikely that it will be bought out, i.e. taken private. Netflix most closely resembles the future of global television. And, quite frankly, who wouldn't want to own a global television network? I address the more quantifiable aspects of the business in a prior article.
