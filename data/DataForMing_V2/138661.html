AAPL Down 15% From Highs - Worst Drop In 30 Months | Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! The headlines are dramatic, ugly and depressing to anyone who holds gold right now. Broad market sentiment has shifted from disdain and dismissive to highly negative. Hedge funds are shorting gold... For years now China has been heralded as an economic miracle that will drive the global economy towards growth and eventually eclipse the US as THE superpower in the world. The quest for perfection is manâ€™s unattainable goal. Man can never be perfect if we are to believe the English philosopher Thomas Hobbes. Man is manâ€™s wolf and all of that.

Apple is now down 15% from record highs as "no brainer" investors begin to question their faith in its China prospects. This is the biggest drop since January 2013 and overall AAPL is now almost unchanged on the year...AAPL has lost $27bn market cap today.. a TWTR or a LNKD Tue, 08/04/2015 - 11:12 | 6389384 realmoney2015 Good! Apple helps 'our' government spy on us constantly. Sell your stock (i know nobody here is dumb enough to gamble in that market anyway) and ditch your iPhones and iPads.

With crApple Watch and the other things it's looking at, yes. A friend of mine bought an iWatch (sic) and has put it up on eBay. Tue, 08/04/2015 - 11:12 | 6389387 Dr. Engali I guess that the fact that you need to buy a watch for you iWatch isn't a good business model after all: Tue, 08/04/2015 - 11:16 | 6389404 Temporalist You also need a phone to use a watch...so make that 2 watches and a phone just to tell time and play Tic-Tac-Toe. Tue, 08/04/2015 - 11:16 | 6389405 City_Of_Champyinz Apple is out of ideas, there is no way that you can shine an iTurd and magically 'fix' this firm.  iWatch?? Give me a break. Tue, 08/04/2015 - 11:25 | 6389446 Temporalist Apple out of ideas HA!  You silly non-fanboy didn't you hear about the iHeadband?  And the iKneebrace?  And the iShoelaces?  iDeas are never lacking (just good ideas).

US hedge fund Citadel banned from share trading on Shenzhen account The order to bar the Citadel account was given by the Shenzhen stock exchange. The China Securities Regulatory Commission has said "coordinated stock dumping" and "selling-off of heavily weighted stocks" as well as automated, algorithm-driven trading caused market turbulence. Citadel is being probed for "spoofing", a practice that involves placing and then cancelling orders, distorting prices in the process Tue, 08/04/2015 - 11:23 | 6389438 Rathmullan it's a memorial to all those dead aapl/foxconn workers who were driven to kill themselves so aapl could beat quarterly war street margin estimates Tue, 08/04/2015 - 11:27 | 6389474 Temporalist Tue, 08/04/2015 - 12:40 | 6389944 Consuelo I think the Chinese - much like the Russians, know what time it is now.   This act by the CSRC is no small move, and it shows as well, just how desperate certain Western entities are (and rightfully so) to keep the Bretton Woods arrangement functioning and $$$funneling properly.     Tue, 08/04/2015 - 11:17 | 6389408 arbwhore Just in time for AAPL to stage a rebound (thanks Janet) and burn all shorts yet again. Keep buying thoe SpyPhones people... and use lots of debt to do it.

Tue, 08/04/2015 - 12:22 | 6389832 twh99 Or Netflix.  AAPL is trading a 13 x earnings, but NFLX is trading at 265 x earnings.  Which one is the better deal? Tue, 08/04/2015 - 12:28 | 6389858 Consuelo Ok DG, so 'amusing' might be a bit harsh...   How about, 'observationally interesting'.   I mean, in a rapid downward cascade of the Nasdaq, it could happen.  And this is coming from a lifelong Apple user - Macbook Pro 8,2 I'm banging away on right now...
