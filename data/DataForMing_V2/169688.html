Apple's iPhone Installment Plan To Drive Significant Sales In Second Half 2015 - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha L&F Capital Management , L&F Capital Management (385 clicks) Sep. 11, 2015 12:44 PM ET  |  About: Apple Inc. (AAPL) , Includes: S , T , TMUS , VZ by: L&F Capital Management Through offering iPhones on a 24-month installment plan with 12-month upgrade optionality, Apple is appealing to the consumer desired subscription payment model while generating higher revenue per unit. The upgrade program should be widely adopted due to its rolling out 12 months prior to a new-gen iPhone launch, presumably the iPhone 7. Installment plans have been widely used and adopted by consumers in the US telco industry, and Apple will face intense iPhone EIP competition from T-Mobile, Sprint, Verizon and AT&T. With only a 27% migration rate to the iPhone 6 product line, a new installment plan from Apple and more favorably priced installment plans from telcos will generate significant unit growth. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has stated that it intends to sell its iPhones, specifically the new iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, on an installment plan, with optionality for a new iPhone Upgrade Program. The installment business model, while new for Apple, is nothing new for US consumers. Installment plans have been widely used and adopted by consumers among wireless services. By adopting an installment plan model, Apple is thrusting itself into one of the most price-competitive industries driven by a significant amount of promotional activity. The popularity of the installment plan among consumers, though, is unquestionable, and we believe this newly structured business model will resonate well with consumers and drive significant iPhone unit sales growth in the back-half of 2015. The new installment plan is offered at $27 to $31 per month over 24 months for 6s and 6s Plus models, with specific price depending on phone specs. That equates to roughly $649, and is simply attractive to consumers in that the cost is amortized over two years. The more exciting news Apple unveiled was its Upgrade Program, which is an extension of the new installment plan. It's still a 24 -month plan, but consumers in the Upgrade Program pay between $32.45 to $47.45 per month for an iPhone 6s or 6s Plus, with price again depending on phone specs. After a full 12 months of payments, the consumer is eligible for a free iPhone upgrade, at which point a new 24 month cycle starts. After a full 12 months of payments on the new 24 month cycle, the consumer can upgrade again. It's important to note that the monthly payments include full AppleCare+ warranty services, which are normally an additional $129 over two years. Obviously, the plan has many benefits for the consumer, including appealing to the much desired subscription, monthly payment model and rolling full services inclusive of warranty into one monthly charge. The phone also is unlocked, so this allows the consumer greater flexibility in choosing and switching between service providers. The timing of the program is ideal as well. According to RBC Capital Markets, only roughly 27% of the iPhone install base has migrated to the iPhone 6 product line as of the June quarter, so there remains a significant portion of consumers who have yet to migrate to the iPhone 6 series. The installment plan and upgrade program allow consumers who have not yet upgraded the opportunity to seize two upgrades within 12 months for as low as $32.45 per month. We believe this holds great influence as presumably the iPhone 7 will be released next year, and there should be greater excitement surrounding the 7 than there was surrounding the 6s and Plus models, as is the normal trend. From a revenue standpoint, the new installment plan and upgrade program allow Apple to generate significantly greater revenue per unit as it enables Apple to refurbish and resell prior models. At the cheapest quote of $32.45 per month, the annualized revenue for Apple is $389.40 for a 6s on the installment plan. Assuming the consumer upgrades after 12 months, Apple is then given that phone back and can resell it as a used model. Assuming Apple discounts the model so it sells for 75% of the $649 straight-up cost, then Apple would resell the already one-year used iPhone 6s for $486.75. This means that for one iPhone 6s, Apple would generate $389.40 in installment payments over a 12-month period plus $486.75 for resale, which brings net revenue per 6s to $876.15. An iPhone 6s straight-up would cost $649 and AppleCare+ would cost an additional $129 over two years for a total of $778. The installment plan and upgrade program allow Apple to generate nearly 1.13x as much revenue per iPhone as it would without the upgrade program. Apple will face intense competition from US telecommunication providers T-Mobile (NYSE: TMUS ), Sprint (NYSE: S ), Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) and AT&T (NYSE: T ). EIPs, or Equipment Installment Plans, have increased dramatically in the US telco business and are more and more becoming the norm. US carrier providers are switching significant portions of their customer base from pre-paid to post-paid, and this is causing significant headwinds in the industry in terms of ARPU (average revenue per user). All carriers are switching to this EIP model, so each player in the industry is engaged in intense promotional activity, almost in spite of one another , which is further causing ARPU degradation. All in all, the US telco industry, specifically among cell service providers, has transformed into one of the most intense price wars in the US. And now Apple is thrusting itself into the fray. Apple's pricing isn't terribly competitive to TMUS, S, VZ or T's pricing plans as a whole, but this is likely because the four major cell service providers have been undercutting each other for some time now, continually vying for North America market share. Per the chart below, Sprint and T-Mobile offer markedly lower monthly rates than Apple, while Verizon offers slightly better monthly rates than Apple, and AT&T offers comparable monthly rates to Apple. Apple, however, is Apple, and we do not believe this statement should be understated. We believe that many consumers will choose Apple over AT&T and Verizon because of the Apple brand name, the unlocked capability, and the upgrade capability. At this point, AT&T and Verizon are simply too expensive on a monthly basis, and Verizon's prices, though slightly better, aren't rolled in with an upgrade after 12 months. AT&T will perhaps be able to leverage its recent DirecTV acquisition to help its cause. The discussion becomes interesting and unclear when it comes to Sprint and T-Mobile. Sprint and T-Mobile are each gaining significant traction in this market on heavy promotional activity driving substantial subs growth. Sprint and T-Mobile each have a momentum advantage in getting subs for the EIP model, and this momentum could play a factor in swaying iPhone 6s and Plus buyers. Apple's distinct advantage is the phones under its plan are not unlocked, so they can be used with any carrier of choice. This gives greater flexibility to the consumer. In response, though, T-Mobile plans to offer its subs the ability to unlock the phone at any time during the installment plan's 18-month span ($20 per month for 18 months with option to either buy a phone for remaining $164 at end of time frame or give phone back). The caveat is that if a consumer chooses to unlock the phone during the 18-month span, the individual will have to pay a full monthly price. Full monthly price, though, isn't too much of a premium to what Apple EIP subs will be paying on a monthly basis, depending which month the TMUS consumer chose to cancel in (full price over 18 months equates to roughly $36 per month). In the end, we believe there will be a significant amount of iPhone 6s and 6s Plus units shipped over the next year, and specifically this holiday season as consumers try to maximize the upgrade program to get the iPhone 7 as early as possible. Apple already has placed an order for a staggering number of iPhones that will be built in the back-half of 2015, somewhere on the order of 115-130 million units. We see the only obstacle in way of tremendous iPhone sales in 2H15 as weakened demand in China and if CEO Tim Cook is right about demand continuing to be strong for iPhones in China, then the back-half of 2015 could see huge iPhone sales numbers.
