'Star Wars' Will Help Disney In 2016 - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Investors are concerned about the level of impact the latest Star Wars sequel will have on Disney's financials. Theatrical releases tend to have a limited impact on the company's top line, which has led many investors to conclude a dim impact by the upcoming Star Wars movie. I believe the Star Wars saga will provide Disney with a necessary boost in the coming year provided that the company sustains its other sources of revenue. In about a month's time the highly anticipated, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, will release. As much as your average Star Wars fan is awaiting the movie's release I can assure you there are plenty of investors who are looking forward to the continuation of George Lucas's masterpiece. Recently I have been coming across people who have been saying that the new Star Wars series is going to have a limited impact on Disney's (NYSE: DIS ) stock, and maybe even have close to no impact at all considering the fact that the last three additions to the Saga were major disappointments. A lot of analyses fail to take into account the impact of merchandising associated with successful franchises. A case in point to support this argument is the impact of Frozen on Disney's Consumer Products segment. A whole two years after the release of the animated movie, Frozen merchandise is still a contributor to Disney's Consumer Products segment, according to its financial reports. I believe the new Star Wars movie will have a significant impact for Disney, even more than Frozen. They don't even have to develop a franchise from scratch. The fact that J. J. Abrams was chosen to direct the movie goes to show that Disney wants to avoid making the mistake made with the last trilogy; this Star Wars is being made by a nerd for the nerds. It is safe to say that Disney executives are all geared up to profit from post-release merchandise sales, which should start showing an impact in the first quarter report of fiscal 2016. Executives at Disney are well aware of the fact that theatrical releases only have a limited impact on revenues, so they're planning on putting Star Wars to good use by building two 14-acre Star Wars parks at Disneyland, California and Walt Disney Resort in Florida. Through these parks the company hopes that it can replicate the sort of success associated with the Harry Potter series. Keep in mind that no schedule for the ambitious theme park project has been announced yet, with construction on the new Star Wars land is set to begin early next year. Furthermore, consumer spending remains robust and the labor market in the US continues to be resilient. As leisure activities such as amusement park sales are closely related to the health of the economy, Disney should be able to avail the opportunity to its fullest through its Parks and Resorts Segment. As you can see in the two graphs, there is a strong relationship between the revenues from the Parks and Resorts segment and US consumer spending throughout the period of 2005-2014. On the other hand about half of Disney's operating income comes from its Media Networks segment, which houses the powerful ESPN. The latest quarterly report shows that the Media Networks segment saw revenues climb by a healthy 10%, helping push operating income for the segment by more than $470 million, a positive impact of 6%. So it's safe to say that the Media Networks segment is going to continue being a powerhouse for the Walt Disney Company despite some long term threats it faces. Why do I feel the necessity to mention this segment in an analysis about Star Wars' impact on Disney? The Media Networks segment is Disney's largest revenue generator, contributing about 45% of the company's revenues this fiscal year. If it crashes then no matter how big of a movie the company releases it won't have any ameliorating affect on the company's bottom line. Furthermore, if the Media Networks segment continues to remain on a growth path then its stability will allow the new Star Wars movie to show its impact through the Studio Entertainment, Parks and Resorts, and Consumer Products Segments. These three business segments make up more than 50% of the company's revenues. In the past 200 days Disney shares have risen by more than 20% while the S&P 500 index has risen by approximately 1% in the same time. Over the past 52-weeks DIS has gone up by 27% to its current position of $115.25 and with a P/E ratio of 23.53 it is by no means the least expensive alternative, but it is the only alternative offering steady capital gains as well as strong EPS results (posted a record EPS of $4.90 for FY15). Depending on your risk appetite I see two strategies you can take up. The first one, which is a reflection of the Wall Street narrative, is that you should load up on DIS till the release of Star Wars: The Force Awakens and sell the stock right afterwards. The second strategy is that you hold onto Disney stock throughout 2016, a strategy I personally favor. In fact, if the stock price does decline around the release of Star Wars I would suggest the long term investor go in further and buy more Disney shares. As long as Disney can deliver earnings growth I feel the high P/E ratio is more than justified. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
