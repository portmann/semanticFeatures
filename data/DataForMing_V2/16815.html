Is The Boeing 787-9 Really Going To Help Air France-KLM? (Part 2) - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Boeing 787-9 should aid Air France-KLM in achieving higher load factors. At higher fuel prices the fuel savings offset the higher lease rate. In Part 1 of this article I compared the Boeing (NYSE: BA ) 787-9 and the Boeing 777-200ER and concluded that the Boeing 787-9 should be able to return higher profits to Air France-KLM ( OTCPK:AFLYY / OTC:AFRAF ). Air-France-KLM has been coping with disappointing results on its long-haul operations. The order for Boeing 787-9s and Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSF ) A350-900s should aid the holding in booking stronger profits on its long haul operations that has seen profit declines over the last years. I will, again, compare the airframes at 100% load factor and average load factor. Due to the fact that the Boeing 787-9 has about the same capacity I will not take into account an adjusted occupancy rate (as I did in Part 1). A typical mission that normally is operated using an Airbus A330-300 has been outline below: Flight from Amsterdam to Vancouver, trip distance 5030 nm 10% reserve fuel; jet fuel price of $3 per gallon No landing or take-off fees have been taken into account Figure 1: Efficiency changes Boeing 787-9 versus Airbus A330-300 (Source: Dhierin-Perkash Bechai) Figure 1 shows that the Boeing 787-9 is a leap forward. The airframe seems to be slightly heavier, while having a 6% higher aerodynamic efficiency and 12% higher propulsive efficiency. The capacity remains more or less equal. Replacement Airbus A330-300 by Boeing 787-9 First of all it is worth to look at both aircraft with 100% load factors (all seats are occupied). The Boeing 787-9 generates 1% higher revenue and has 20% lower fuel costs, resulting in a 2.5% higher profit. Figure 2 shows a visualization of the per seat results. The fuel consumption per seat is 19.2% lower. The fuel consumption per 100 passenger-km is 2.73 L for the Boeing 787 and 3.42 L for the Airbus A330-300. Figure 2: Per seat figures for the Boeing 787-9 (Source: Dhierin-Perkash Bechai) Figure 2 shows that the revenue per seat is 0.1% higher. Aided by 20% lower fuel costs per seat the profit per seat rises 2%. Figure 3: Per seat fuel efficiency for Boeing 787-9 and Airbus A330-300 (Source: Dhierin-Perkash Bechai) The figure clearly shows that the Boeing 787-9 has a significant fuel advantage over the Airbus A330-300. One of the things that has to be noted is that the load factors are never 100%. Air France-KLM has an average load factor of 85.6%. Therefore it is better to have a look at the airframes at a lower load factor. Replacement Boeing 777-200ER by Boeing 787-9 at load factor of 85.6% The load factor of 85.6% for both airframes shows that the revenue is 1.3% higher, combined with 20% lower fuel burn this results in 4.6% higher profit. At a load factor of 85.6% the Boeing 787-9 has 2 more revenue generating seats compared to the Airbus A330-300. Capacity and fuel costs are 2 important factors that determine the profit, but what should also be taken into account are the lease rates of the aircraft. If savings on fuel costs are completely offset by the higher lease rates the rush to attract fuel efficient aircraft mitigates. The lease rate for a Boeing 787-9 is about $1.35 mln per month, for the Airbus A330-300 this is about $0.925 mln. Per month the Boeing 787-9 is approximately $425000 more expensive to operate. Per year leasing the Boeing 787-9 instead of the Boeing 777-200ER is almost $5.1 mln more expensive. Assuming that the route is operated 7 times per week or (14 flights including return flight) by 2 Boeing 787s instead of 2 Airbus A330-300s, gives an advantage of $5 mln for the Boeing 787-9. Figure 4: Per seat fuel efficiency for Boeing 787-9, Airbus A330-300 and Boeing 777-200ER (Source: Dhierin-Perkash Bechai) The Boeing 787-9 is able to actively lower fuel costs, resulting in a higher profit which completely offsets the higher lease rate for the Boeing 787-9. The Boeing 787-9 is a suitable replacement for the Boeing 777-200ER and Airbus A330-300. With fuel prices of $2 per gallon the attractiveness of replacing the Boeing 777-200ER mitigates somewhat. The higher lease rates for the Boeing 787-9 are offset by the reduction in fuel costs. The Boeing 787-9 should aid Air France-KLM in achieving higher load factors as well as increasing profitability on their long-haul operations.
