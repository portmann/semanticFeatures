Revisiting Verizon - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha In this article we revisit our valuation of Verizon, and determined it presents an overall low-to-moderate risk to the value investor and a substantial discount to intrinsic value. 20% of its current price reflects a premium for its future growth, which we find reasonable considering our high growth value estimate for VZ. We estimated VZ at a 24% margin of safety, even after applying conservative assumptions and some penalties. It has been a couple months since we last conducted a valuation analysis of Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ ). Back then, the analyst we assigned to VZ pegged the company at an 11.6% discount to fair value given the then market price of $48. We have since made some adjustments in our valuation process and recently ran the company under our systematic, rule-based risk assessment. It is a balanced scorecard that considers the past performance, historical volatility, and underlying trend of over 40 different risk factors in multiple factor groups and utilizes proprietary standards to systematically score these risk factors across five levels. We believe such analysis adds value for the reader, as they adequately define the major risks in any business, accurately measure them, and succinctly describe them in an easily comprehensible format. Overall, Verizon is a business that exposes the long-term investor to low-to-moderate risks. For the sake of brevity, we condense this article to discuss Verizon's relative fundamental performance against its peers and its future prospects, which we think is prudent as its 1st quarter for the year has just ended with solid results. (See this link .) Investment decisions are generally made on expectations of the future, whether or not such expectations involve unique characteristics or far-reaching themes. Inherent Stability is a critical element in any forward-looking analysis. The reliability and trustworthiness of the management team running Verizon Communications and the spread of VZ's economic moat are crucial to any long-term value generated by the company. Here, we observed that VZ has a low-to-moderate candor risk and competitive risks are currently low, with its cost controls and returns on invested capital offsetting its mediocre performance in creditworthiness and efficiency. Earnings quality validates the numbers backing the reported earnings figures. We evaluate this risk factor by comparing profits produced by accrual accounting and profits calculated from a cash basis, by computing accruals ratios using either the balance sheet or the cash flow statement, and by referring to both the Beneish M-Score of earnings manipulation and Thomson Reuters' StarMine Earnings Quality model, which systematically looks for earnings persistence based on accruals, cash flow, high returns on assets, and similarity of pro forma earnings to GAAP earnings and grades virtually all businesses in the Reuters database from 1 to 100, classified by geographic region. Verizon exhibits a record of adequate earnings quality. Decomposed, we observed that the divergence between accrual and cash profits have been well-managed and quantitative models designed to test for earnings quality or earnings manipulation paint Verizon in a positive light. Below, we graphed two Accruals ratios and compared EBITDA and EBIT to Net OCF and OCF before cash interest and taxes. We considered the overall trend, as we want to see these numbers as close to zero as possible. Source: Thomson Reuters, Calculations by Saibus Research Glancing at the chart, we see that Verizon's EBITDA has consistently maintained between a 10% and 25% difference against Net Operating Cash Flows, up until the most recent year. EBIT, on the other hand, demonstrated a greater difference against Net OCF before cash interest and taxes, though this had been showing a trend towards convergence from 2008 and onward. In contrast, the accruals ratios display high volatility, with ratios computed using the balance sheet method going up and those computed with the cash flow statement method dropping below zero. We truncated FY 2014 away due to the severely outlying figure produced by its low net operating assets. The earnings quality model provided by Thomson Reuters provides more clarity into the reliability and persistence of VZ's accounting profits. Despite our rather inconclusive view of VZ's accruals, the StarMine Model runs counter to this initial analysis and paints a portrait of a business that can be relied on. Source: Thomson Reuters for the Earnings Quality model. Model results are applicable for North America. Companies are graded from 1 to 100, with 100 being the highest quality. The Beneish M-Score is computed systematically by Saibus Research and reflects the possibility management is manipulating reported earnings. Scores greater than -2.22 indicate higher probabilities of earnings management taking place. As seen here, the Earnings Quality model has placed Verizon Communications at a great position, a notable improvement compared to the first half of the last decade. The Beneish M-Score echoes these sentiments, placing the company well below the -2.22 threshold. Moving on, to assess Verizon's economic moat, we compared the company to a peer group consisting of four companies, which we carefully selected through VZ's corporate filings and a list of peers provided by Reuters, screened further for better compatibility. These companies include T-Mobile (NYSE: TMUS ), AT&T (NYSE: T ), CenturyLink (NYSE: CTL ), and Frontier Communications (NASDAQ: FTR ). Because we are verifying the strengths of Verizon's competitive advantages and management skill - which directly impacts our valuations - we are judging VZ on the basis of relative fundamental performance as opposed to relative valuation. Assessing relative creditworthiness, we scrutinized Verizon's liabilities-to-assets and solvency ratios and judged these against the peer group as defined earlier. Here, we see that Verizon has consistently been the more leveraged out of the peer group, typically surpassed by Frontier Communications prior to 2010. In contrast, VZ's solvency ratios have been consistently in the middle of the pack, hovering around our 20% benchmark for safety. T-Mobile's EBITDA figures generally fall beneath 20% of total liabilities (with the exception being 2011, when it hit 80% once). AT&T's went wild across the years, while Frontier and CenturyLink both saw declining solvency ratios, with Frontier dropping at a steeper rate. Source: Thomson Reuters, Calculations by Saibus Research We turn to the cash conversion cycle and asset turnover ratios for a look at VZ's relative efficiency. For the first, we noted Verizon to have placed last place among the peer group, with every other competitor seeing posting greater negative figures in the early half of the decade. But over time, this has since degraded and all four peers saw their CCCs rising, with T-Mobile nearly breaking positive in 2011. In the meantime, Verizon's CCC declined below 20 days, owing to faster receivables collection, faster inventory sales, and stable payment of trade payables. For the second, we look at total asset turnovers to ascertain the effectiveness of VZ's asset utilization with respect to sales generation, relative to the peer group as defined. As much as we would want to compare VZ's net operating asset turnovers to its peers, we did not appraise it as both CenturyLink and Frontier Communications posted negative net operating assets over the last ten years, which would've skewed the risk assessment upwards. Source: Thomson Reuters. T-Mobile's 2011 Total Asset Turnover was trimmed out to account for an outlier. In this chart, we see Verizon has consistently performed on top with its sales generation, rarely deviating from 0.50 as did AT&T and T-Mobile. Meanwhile, CenturyLink and Frontier Communications performed 40% worse than the three aforementioned businesses, though they were just as consistent for the most part. This is not bad by itself, and theoretically a company with a higher turnover and a company with a much lower one could have equivalent returns on investment depending on the nature and quality of their cost controls. However, Verizon typically placed within the top 3 firms in terms of profit margins, especially after 2008. Source: Thomson Reuters, Calculations by Saibus Research Given the volatility we've seen the other four go through, we are relieved by the stability of Verizon's margins. When combined with the stable asset turnover ratios, this results in solid, if not superior, returns on invested capital: Source: Thomson Reuters, Calculations by Saibus Research. T-Mobile data for 2011 and 2012 were trimmed due to highly negative levels. Ultimately, this is a clear demonstration of Verizon's competitive advantages against its peers. However, we caution that VZ's capital expenditures has been declining as a % of its sales, and this may reflect in lost competitiveness five years from now, more or less. See below. Finally, we consider future prospects from two perspectives. First, we considered the possibility the company may surprise Wall Street's expectations for cash flow per share, returns on assets, and returns on equity over the next three fiscal years. Second, we contrasted Wall Street's forward 10Y EPS growth projections against the market-implied expectation of same, if the data is available. Although this cannot completely substitute for true industry research, which relay the qualitative trends and developments noted by technical and economic experts in an industry, and a thorough, qualitative perusal of the firm's strategic focus and adherence to its organizational values, appraising the detailed expectations set by Wall Street's sell-side research allows us to grasp the future prospect of the company by proxy. The table below details Reuters' compilation of analyst estimates (after adjusting them for the analysts' track record and level of experience) for Verizon's financial performance, looking ahead over the next four fiscal years. Source: Thomson Reuters. Analyst estimates for revenues and degree of profitability were also included for clarity. Referencing the adjusted analyst estimates above, we can see that revenues are more likely going to remain stagnant over the next four years. Profitability margins and capital expenditures, too, will remain stagnant. Verizon is not the only one expected to remain stagnant. For example, AT&T's adjusted estimates also appear to have similar projections. Next, we compared the market-implied expectations for EPS growth over the next 10 years against those expected by the sell-side analysts working at large firms. Wall Street expects EPS to grow 5.55% a year, whereas the market price implies growth of 3.83% a year over the same time frame, demonstrating a difference of 172 basis points. (Source: Thomson Reuters) We find this gap heartening, as it indicates an opportunity to take advantage of. Shortening our time frame to a five-year period, we see a similar differential. This similarity increases our confidence in the possibility Verizon will provide tremendous value over the long run. Proceeding forward, we ran our valuation analysis using a risk-adjusted WACC of 7.13% (as opposed to the prior analyst's 11%, which lowered his valuations), a terminal growth rate equal to 1.6% in long-term inflation (United States), average free cash flow margins of 12.34%, which reflects a 19% operating margin (5Y moving average), a 20% tax rate (which reflects the median), and net investments equivalent to 0.17% of sales, which means capital expenditures is presently no different from depreciation. We also use a competitive advantage period of 10 years to account for VZ's strong competitive advantages. In addition, due to persistent use of unusual items and about 10% of total assets stuck in goodwill, we also penalized Verizon by $2.5 billion every year throughout the forecast period and reduced net present value by an additional $7.4 billion to account for any asset impairments. Enterprise values as computed are subject to a negative $84.1 billion adjustment that accounts for non-operating cash, debt, and dilution, as well as other extraneous factors like deferred tax liabilities. This overall adjustment corresponds to $20.63 per share, but the firm's debt can be broken down to $27.77 per share, thus signifying the impact of financial leverage on equity value. In a steady state scenario, we presumed sales to instantly plummet another 12% to $112 billion and stay there, with profit margins steady at about 13% (calculated by 85% of the average operating margin and the median tax rate). Capitalizing the profits and adjusting them will yield a $162.41 billion equity value, or $41.15 per share. In a growth scenario, using the conservative assumptions as defined above, we further presumed a conservative CAGR sales growth of 3.5% for every year after FY 2018. This resulted in implied sales and FCF growth of 1.4% and 6.0% per year, compounded, the former of which being very conservative relative to the historical record. The result is an equity value of $260.58 billion, or $66.50 per share. Before we move on, we'd like to point out that VZ is trading at $50.41 per share as of May 1st, 2015. Yesterday's close was not so far. Generally, the gap between Net Assets and Stagnation measures the depth of a company's economic moat. With almost $40 difference between Stagnation and Net Assets, it is suggested that Verizon's economic moat is very wide and very, very deep. However, with total assets at $232.71 billion (about $57 per share), this shows how much leverage has influenced the investments put into the company and distorts the quantified resilience of Verizon's economic moat. Comparing Stagnation to the market price produces about $9 difference. We interpret this to mean that 20% of Verizon's market price contains a premium that investors pay for Verizon's future growth. We think Verizon's fundamental performance at least supports the premium investors are paying for at this price level. The two-stage DCF H-Model used to produce our estimated intrinsic value shows that the market is selling Verizon Communications at a 24% discount to intrinsic value and implies a potential upside of nearly 32% over the long run. Our estimates are notably conservative as the DCF model already accounts for bad acquisitions and other extraneous expenses and presumes low rates of sales growth and a subdued operating margin, relative to the current year. Next, we take this DCF model and its adjustments and "reverse-engineer" our valuation to arrive at the expected growth implied by the market price and Wall Street's price targets for the next 12 to 18 months. As the tables below show, their expectations appear pessimistic and there is a good chance for Verizon to outperform going forward.
