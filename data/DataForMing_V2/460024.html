Apple's Lengthening iPhone Cycle Headwind - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha It has been six years and more than an 250% rise since I had my eureka Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) moment after my wife dropped her iPhone in the toilet. My thesis back then was simple: Smartphones don't last. They get smashed, dropped, mangled, or - like my wife's - drown. The ruined phones are replaced. The cycle repeats millions of times (as it turned out, over 700 million iphones). And voil√†, Cupertino becomes a gold mine. Everything has a life: Notebooks, cell phones, media players, desktops. Nobody gets out of here alive including all those gizmos. Some people can keep their notebooks a long time; my daughter's kept hers going for 6 years! Our desktop is 8 years old. But nobody, and I mean nobody, keeps their cell going for that long. Two years tops, if you go by my family. The revelation delivered. Apple's stock rose more than 250% since the article - more than covering the loss of my wife's phone. But times have changed: Handsets have become much sturdier. For one, smartphones withstand water a lot better. iPhones are just harder to damage. One daredevil even tested his 6S by dropping it ten feet - it survived . This is not my wife's delicate 2010 iPhone. Competitive forces are driving Apple to design more durable smartphones. For example, Samsung markets its S7 as able to survive Lil' Wayne pouring champagne over. No wonder, Apple's upcoming iPhone 7 is rumored to be completely waterproof . Besides, millenials are holding on to their old iPhones, even damaged ones. Case in point: My daughter has nursed her smartphone despite a cracked screen. At first, I thought it was just my baby grown up into a practical - and cheap - adult, until I noticed several of her friends also had crazed handset screens. Besides my daughter and her friends, I've seen lots of millenials with shattered smartphone displays. That triggered my second Apple eureka moment: Millenials are extending the life of their iPhones. Consumer Intelligence Research Partners reports this new demographic trend: People keep the iPhone longer . iPhone owners delay upgrading their phones: According to CIRP's study, over the last three years, the average age of an iPhone has increased by approximately three months. The study's authors predict iPhone owners will keep their phones longer and upgrade less often. We've seen verification of this trend. Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) reported fewer 4G smartphones activated last quarter. In Q1, 8.1 million were activated , 0.6 million fewer than the prior year, according to the telecom company. No longer a fashion or status statement, the iPhone is everywhere, accounting for 43% of the US market. Because there is less share to take, Apple needs a fast iPhone replacement cycle. The iPhone's improving durability creates a strong headwind. Unless Apple can create new must-have features, people won't upgrade until they must. We will keep our phones as long as they work. The smartphone will become like the old jalopy: While everyone must own one, the goal is to keep the darn thing running. Gone will be the days of upgrading to a new handset every year. The smartphone lifespan will get longer because of improved durability and performance and consumer thriftiness. It would not surprise me that the "upgrade" goes the way of the horse and buggy. The iPhone has evolved. It's faster and lighter and smarter - and lasts. Unfortunately for Apple, the iPhone has become durable and its customers pragmatic. Apple faces a longer replacement iPhone cycle. Unless Cupertino gives customers a strong reason to upgrade, expect declining iPhone sales in the years ahead.
