Is AMD Falling Into The Abyss? - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) | Seeking Alpha AMD's earnings seem to have surprised many people; they shouldn't have. Q2 will be a very poor quarter for the company. By now, most readers have seen the Q1 earnings AMD (NASDAQ: AMD ) released on Thursday, and have seen all the gloom and doom scenarios written, and the overall pessimism regarding the stock. The earnings, more or less, played out the only way they could have, once we knew what the market looked like, and we saw AMD was not releasing new graphics processors. So, we'll go over what happened in the earnings, fairly dispassionately. To understand AMD, you still have to understand the PC market, and the relative positions of the companies. This is more difficult to do than it sounds, as people are quite passionate about AMD and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ), but it still has to be attempted. AMDroids want to think Carrizo is the greatest thing since the A-Bomb, just like Kaveri was supposed to be. Well, it's not, although it is a bomb in a different sense. Even smart people talk about these inferior products in a manner that AMD announces them, without any further thought. It's easy to believe what you want. But, these are not good parts, and do not compete with Intel's better designed products. This understanding is fundamental to correctly evaluating the investment potential of the company. Let's first differentiate between price and cost, because they are two completely different things. Price is what the market will bear. Cost is what it takes to create the part. It is not the same as price in any way. It's critical to understand the difference, because that gives insight into the possibilities, or lack thereof, for the company. Many times people talk about how AMD's parts are competitive at lower price points with Intel's, and that's good for them. Well, not really. It might be good for you if you're looking to buy something, but as an investor, it just means the market won't pay much for it. That's not a good thing. So, one has to compare the cost to see if a design works or not. Size gives a rough estimation of cost, although there are many factors. But, one thing is clear, the Bulldozer line of processors are not inexpensive to make, as AMD's margins are relatively low. And that's because the design is poor. Even the company has decided the design is so poor it should not be continued. There are other issues for the company, and we'll touch on them, but the most significant is the "big" processors are poorly designed, and not competitive. Carrizo is not going to change that. It's just how it is. With that in mind, the earnings had to be poor, because Intel's were. AMD does have better chips than Intel in the low-end, but Intel is being extremely aggressive with pricing, simply because they have to be; they have fabs they need to keep busy. AMD noted their smaller chips had been doing very well in previous quarters but we did not get any information like this in Q1. But, it starts and ends with Intel's superiority in the big chips, because this finances segments where they lose money. Although the earnings report was pretty predictable, this does not mean nothing of interest came from it. We'll go over some of the points in the conference call that I found interesting, or revealing. Let's first establish that the only way for AMD to survive is to take Intel on, and go head to head. Intel is going after every market, so how can it be avoided? Rather than concede the "big" processor segment of PC market and servers, AMD has to put it in play. It's the easiest market, because there are only two players, and Intel's recent products run from awful (Bay Trail family), to disappointing (Haswell), to wondering if it's even better than the predecessor (Broadwell). Many still view Intel's fabrication technology as a key obstacle to AMD releasing competitive products. That's understandable, because years ago, it mattered a lot. It no longer does. Did Ivy Bridge (22nm) really improve significantly over Sandy Bridge? No, not really, in fact in some ways it was worse. Did Broadwell (14nm) significantly improve on Haswell? Overall, clearly it did not. So, fabrication technology matter much less now, as "shrinks" do not bestow the same kinds of advantages in clock speeds like they used to, nor the same drop in transistor cost. In fact, for Intel, the 32nm Sandy Bridge is still considered their best overclocker. On top of this, TSMC (NYSE: TSM ) and Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) have significantly closed the gap. Clearly then, this does not prevent AMD from competing in performance. I bring this up because Lisa Su has made it clear she's going for Intel. There's no way around it, and it's a battle they can win. By ditching SeaMicro, and by increasing "big" server investments, which she indicated AMD did, the company is clearly being aggressive about the traditional server market. It also indicates a vote of confidence for the newly designed processors coming out in 2016. It is also important to note that this has implications outside of the server context, since the mainstream market will be essentially the same technology. It was critical the company accept this challenge. That's the crux of the situation. AMD will continue to struggle in 2015, until the new design known as Zen is available to compete in the higher end of the x86 market. Until then, there's going to be pain. I've said this since Kaveri came out and bombed, and it took no insight to say it. It's just that obvious. But, there were other points to consider from the earnings, although none are as important as that. Embedded was flat year to year, and that's unexpected, and quite disappointing, since AMD had put a lot of effort into growing that segment. Is it a short term blip, or does it show a general weakness in AMD's offerings? Because it was caused by a drop in thin client demand, it appears more likely an aberration, as other sub-segments increased enough to offset it. Still, we should keep an eye on this as the year unfolds. The GPU market was horrible, but that was expected. AMD simply doesn't have competitive technology (remember the difference between cost and price when evaluating this), and so continue to suffer. In addition to this, the company is clearing downstream inventory. However, management indicated they expect to gain market share with the new product releases, which is in sharp contrast to lack of such predictions in the PC market. With regards to the PC market the word "hope" was used, giving no indication of real expectations. Rory Read and Su both said they focusing on more commercial sales last year, and in the conference call it was indicated that this happened. So, that's a good thing, except it is improving on such a small number, its not clear how much significance to attach to this. Minimally, it does give some credibility to management in terms of keeping predictions though. We also got more information on the two new semi-custom wins AMD won for 2016. Revenue will now be in the second half of the year, whereas before we were just told 2016 without any reference as to when in 2016. One disturbing part of the conference call is apparently AMD's new GPUs will not be out until the second half of the year. Lisa Su said "we're also launching some graphics products in the second half of this year." So, any relief in the GPU segment is at least a quarter away. Expect Q2 to be fairly abysmal, Carrizo is not going to save the day. When they were discussing the wafer agreement, it became very clear the back end of the year is heavily weighted, and the GPUs are one reason. Console chips will be another. The Windows 10 release will cause OEMs to lean out their inventory in quarters leading to its release, with the consequent increase after. One point that impressed me about Su was, she was quite open and honest that she was not sure how much of an impact Windows 10 would have. This is sensible, because there's no precedence for it (considering the market conditions, and the fact Windows 7 and 8 users get a free upgrade to Windows 10). Intel's management seemed a bit more concrete with their predictions, which is alarming since they so badly mispredicted the impact of Windows XP support ending, this quarter. One thing that is clear though is, for consumer parts, inventory levels will be kept relatively low by OEMs, since they have to play it safe. So, even if consumers are indifferent to the release of Windows 10, there will be that impact. Q2 is just not going to be pleasant. Overall, I was pretty happy with the conference call, because AMD is a very simple company to figure out. If Zen is a good product, AMD will do very well. If anything, the extra investment in the server platform indicates AMD has much more confidence in this processor than it does with the Bulldozer line, which was never competitive except in very limited scenarios. I'm a bit disappointed by the new GPUs being released in the second half, but was more encouraged by the continued success in the professional GPU segment, which is more important going forward. Greater commercial shipments also could be quite positive, particularly as AMD develops more competitive technology in 2016. So, it might look bad, particularly the numbers, but there's probably more good coming from it than bad, provided one had realistic expectations going in. If not, hopefully you will for Q2, which is going to be bad. There's just no other possible scenario. Source: Is AMD Falling Into The Abyss?
