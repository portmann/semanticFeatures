Amazon in talks to take stake in HERE - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Apr  1 2016, 04:20 ET | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) is in talks with BMW ( OTCPK:BAMXY ), Daimler ( OTCPK:DDAIY ) and Audi ( OTCPK:AUDVF ) about taking a stake in their high-definition digital mapping company HERE. Last August, the consortium of German automakers agreed to pay €2.5B ($2.8B) to buy Nokia's mapping business as part of plans to develop self-driving vehicles. However, they need to ensure that maps can cope with live updates on traffic and road conditions collected from thousands of cars. That's likely where Amazon's cloud computing services comes into the picture.
