Alibaba's TBO Raises New Concerns For Netflix In China - Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) | Seeking Alpha BABA to release Tmall Box Office, a video streaming service, in the next couple of months. Subscription, ad-supported streamer will take on free content providers in growing cord-cutting market. Model allows for ad-revenue support, which differs from NFLX and may make it difficult for them to enter the market. NFLX down 2% on June 19 high, investors should now look at BABA for how the market will respond to a native player. Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) isn't even in China yet, and the road to establish itself in the Middle Kingdom has already gotten more difficult with the news that Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) will be offering a video streaming service of its own starting in a couple of months. Named TBO, or Tmall Box Office after its affiliated third-party brand retailer, it will stream Chinese TV shows and movies, as well as in-house entertainment to customers for either a monthly subscription or a show-by-show fee. While Alibaba will still have the same market challenges Netflix will in trying to convince a free content-loving populace to pay for content, it will also have a first mover advantage over Netflix, enabling it to offer content and gain customers in this space as a native company. This will either prove there is a market for this kind of service, and competition can be valued, or it's so competitive with the numerous free streamers that Alibaba will either struggle on its home turf, or carve just enough of the market for itself. This could pose a potential problem to Netflix's business model, which is assumed to follow the same formula as it would elsewhere in the world. Netflix will typically offer a 30-day trial for new customers, and then charge $8/month for streaming access. Without advertising revenue to fall back on, which represents 58% of streaming revenue in the country, Netflix is more dependent on subscriptions than TBO will be, forcing Netflix to either set a lower price for its subscriptions or make major investments in China-specific programming to both create additional value for money and to be on the right side of an often rigged government regulatory system. At the same time though, Alibaba's initial entry into this space could give Netflix a chance to observe how the market reacts to this new entrant rather than being the new entrant themselves. Alibaba is a recognized company in the country, and its affiliate Wasu Media Holdings is also Netflix's partner for license acquisitions for its own streaming service. Judging by how many customers opt for the subscriptions rather than staying with established free players or the 10% of content that isn't behind the pay wall will inform Netflix of the feasibility of its own business model, leading to adjustments as necessary. This will enable the company, and its investors, to see how much revenue can be gained from a market dominated by free services, as well as how high the costs might be compared to other potential markets such as Japan and Southern Europe, which will affect Netflix's profit targets for the next couple of years. Given how Alibaba is able to fall back on advertising revenue if the subscription service doesn't pan out, and how its affiliate will get a chunk of the profits from Netflix's eventual China entry, TBO changes the investment outlook. Alibaba now becomes the company to watch for Q3 and Q4 to see if it can get some momentum going from their streaming service, as well as to judge the near 6.8 billion yuan streaming market in the country to see how it responds to a paying entrant. The news of this release dropped Netflix down 2% in June 19 trading from its morning high, though it has since recovered, which showed that investors took Alibaba's China push seriously. Any future developments with TBO will affect Netflix as well, since it will be a litmus test of the feasibility of two subscription-based entrants in a crowded market. Netflix has other markets that it can lean on, which is why investors should look to wide-open Japan more than here, but since the recent hype has centered around China, some may be disappointed if the market demand doesn't meet early expectations.
