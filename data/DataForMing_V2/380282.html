Apple Car: Let's Hope Motor Trend Is Wrong - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Motor Trend has revealed a design exercise meant to represent where Apple might go with an electric vehicle. Motor Trend is showing how poorly it understands Apple. After teasing a possible insider's look at an Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Car, what Motor Trend actually produced was some very creative speculation. If Apple actually produced the car, the panel of "experts" at Motor Trend envisages, it would be a disaster. Investors needn't fear that Apple is so stupid. The Motor Trend (MT) article betrays the usual misconceptions about Apple and its products. MT assumes, as do many, that Apple is all about style over substance. That Apple has succeeded on the basis of its product design. Fads change, market interest shifts, and poor Apple is getting left behind by the relentless commoditization of the smartphone. Therefore, MT focuses exclusively on design, coming up with what it thinks would be Apple's approach. Something "groundbreaking" in a superficial way, a sleek, futuristic sci-fi car, such as you might see in The Minority Report. The interior is even worse, a bare cartoon with impossibly uncomfortable seats. This isn't even a reasonable depiction of Apple's design approach. Yes, Apple likes sleek and functional designs, but it also willingly adopts design conventions of proven worth. The Apple Watch is a good example. Apple went for a fairly traditional watch form factor, as opposed to something more radical such as the Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Band. The automobile is something that continues to evolve under the pressure of the needs of energy efficiency, safety, and manufacturability. Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA ) designs represent probably the best current compromise for the four-door sedan. So, the Model S and 3 basically look like four-door sedans. They're handsome, sleek, but not radical design departures. I would expect something similar from Apple, but I don't really want to dwell further on design, because I think this was a completely misplaced priority on the part of MT. MT gives almost no thought to the critical elements that could be discriminators for the Apple car: its propulsion system and AI based self-driving capability. There can be little doubt that Apple is working on a car, the so-called Project Titan. Besides the myriad rumors and automotive industry hires, the best evidence for the scale of the project is in Apple's unprecedented real estate shopping spree, which is the talk of the Valley . Apple is already nearing completion of Campus II, the "spaceship," which will add 2.8 million square feet of space and accommodate 12,000 on the 176-acre site. To put this in perspective, Tesla's Fremont plant, the old NUMMI facility, occupies a 370-acre parcel with a 5.5 million square foot main building. As large as the spaceship is, apparently it isn't enough for Apple's future expansion plans. As shown in the map below, Apple has acquired numerous properties (by purchase and lease) in and around Cupertino, SunnyVale, and San Jose. Among those is a large 43-acre swath in San Jose just north of the San Jose International Airport, which is approved for up to 2.8 million square feet of office space. The Mercury News estimates that as of late last year, Apple had leased or bought enough office space or land to accommodate 9 million square feet of space, considerably larger than the spaceship, or even Tesla's main assembly building. One of the Sunnyvale properties was listed by the city manager's office as an " auto testing center ". As reported by Apple Insider , many of the properties go by code names borrowed from Greek mythology, apparently in keeping with the Titan code name. Finally, Apple was widely reported to have interest in an autonomous vehicle test facility in Concord, CA last summer. While Apple clearly anticipates even more expansion, and that expansion appears to be massive and automobile related, none of the land purchases appear to rise to the scale necessary for an actual automotive production facility. This leaves a major unanswered question in how exactly an Apple Car would be produced. A year ago, in my article, Apple's Electric Vehicle Opportunity , I pointed out that there is actually a fairly large market for high-end premium vehicles worldwide. According to KPMG research, the premium market segment annual revenue in 2020 is estimated to be $885 billion. If Apple captured 5% of that, it would acquire revenue of $44.25 billion. This definitely moves the needle. For fiscal 2015, Apple had revenue of $233 billion. One central problem for Apple is profitability. The experience of Tesla operating its own factories must be chastening. Apple management has a profound aversion to losing money. Even if Tesla manages to achieve profitability, that in itself might further discourage Apple. Tesla would have gotten past a lot of learning curve, and be that much further ahead. I'm even more convinced than I was a year ago that Apple needs a manufacturing partner for an Apple Car. This is the approach that fundamentally solved its margin issues with its computing devices. Preferably, the partner would have global manufacturing scale and presence in low labor cost manufacturing regions such as Mexico and Asia. I continue to regard Magna International (NYSE: MGA ), as the best fit for this. Magna does contract vehicle assembly work for a number of automakers and has numerous auto parts manufacturing plants. The other central problem for Apple is offering a meaningful discriminator compared to Tesla. It's been pointed out that EVs are becoming like the smartphone in the sense that they represent closely integrated software and hardware, computer processors and operating systems. This would seem to play to Apple's strength in hardware/software integration, and it does. But this only gets Apple the price of admission to the competition. Apple's systems integration expertise doesn't provide a discriminator compared to Tesla. In the same way that Apple invented the modern smartphone, Tesla has invented the modern electric vehicle. Tesla has already created the "connected car" with over-the-air software updates and autonomous capability. Apple has systems integration experience, Tesla has EV systems integration experience. Tesla is the pioneer, whereas Apple would be playing catch up. If the car as iPhone doesn't offer a sufficient discriminator, what does? I believe Apple would have to offer a truly disruptive and breakthrough technology, in either of the key areas ignored by the MT article: propulsion systems or AI. AI is less likely. Apple isn't actually that strong in AI, although it naturally has the resources to catch up. Autonomous vehicle systems such as Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA ) Drive PX provide a hardware platform, but there's still much work to do in software development. Once again, it appears that autonomous capability is going to be a minimum requirement that just gets Apple into the game, rather than providing a discriminator. That leaves propulsion systems, and this is where I think Apple may have something to offer. In fact, I consider it likely that Apple has some technology in electric energy storage that it assumes will be a discriminator. What that technology might be is open to question. It could be a breakthrough in battery technology, or something along the lines of a fuel cell , as I have previously written about. Although Apple is clearly very interested in (and probably fairly committed to) an Apple Car, Apple must fulfill the key requirements of finding a manufacturing partner and offering sufficient technical discriminators in order for the project to move forward. Anyone can come up with a cool design. The fact that MT thinks that's a necessary and sufficient condition for Apple shows how ignorant it is, not merely of Apple, but of the technology businesses and competitive landscape that has developed in Silicon Valley. I continually see analysts underestimating the level of competitiveness and technology being deployed by companies such as Tesla and Apple. The recent successful landing of a SpaceX booster on a floating, moving barge in the middle of the ocean is very instructive. This is Elon Musk's other company, and it achieved something that had never been done before. The technical depth required for that is something that most in the media don't seem to get. That technical depth is on display in Tesla's automobiles, making Tesla Apple's chief rival as well as the yardstick by which Apple's efforts will be measured. It's a very high standard, even for Apple. Apple won't enter this market unless it can offer something truly remarkable. This makes an Apple Car something less than a done deal, but I'm still hopeful. I don't think Apple would be making the huge investments it's making if it didn't have something to offer. And if Apple enters this market, it's probably the traditional automakers, more than Tesla, which have something to fear. I remain long Apple and recommend it as a buy.
