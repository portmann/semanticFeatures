US Drops Case Against Apple After FBI Successfully Hacks Terrorist's iPhone | Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site!

Dear Tim Cook, the DoJ and FBI will no longer require your assistance in unlocking the iPhone of Syed Farook who, along with his wife Tashfeen Malik, murdered more than a dozen people at an employee holiday party in San Bernardino last December.  As we outlined last week , Israel's Cellebrite, a provider of mobile forensic software, was set to assist the Feds in their attempt to unlock the iPhone. â€œThe government has now successfully accessed the data stored on Farookâ€™s iPhone and therefore no longer requires the assistance from Apple,â€? the Justice Department said in a filing (embedded below). Here's the mainstream media line from The New York Times : Yet law enforcementâ€™s ability to unlock an iPhone through an alternative method raises new uncertainties, including questions about the strength of Appleâ€™s security on its devices. The development also creates potential for new conflicts between the government and Apple. Lawyers for Apple have previously said that the company would want to know the method used to crack open the device. The government may make that method classified. â€œFrom a legal standpoint, what happened in the San Bernardino case doesnâ€™t mean the fight is over,â€? said Esha Bhandari, a staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union. She noted that the government generally goes through a process whereby it decides whether to disclose information about certain vulnerabilities so that manufacturers can patch them. â€œI would hope they would give that information to Apple so that it can patch any weaknesses,â€? she said, â€œbut if the government classifies the tool, that suggests it may not.â€? Right. Or this could all be nonsense. That is, Apple may have just made America an unwitting participant in an iPublicity stunt, as it were. As we suggested just five days ago, "the entire Apple 'stand' for privacy and consumer rights might be one big theatrical spectacle as both parties involved clearly were aware the iPhone can be penetrated with the right tools." Here's AP :  The FBI says it successfully used a mysterious technique without Apple's help to break into an iPhone linked to the gunman in a California mass shooting. The government told a federal court Monday without any details that it accessed data on gunman Syed Farook's iPhone and no longer requires Apple's assistance. Farook and his wife died in a gun battle with police after killing 14 people in San Bernardino, California, in December. A U.S. magistrate last month ordered Apple to provide the FBI with software to help it hack into Farook's work-issued iPhone. The order touched off a debate pitting digital privacy rights against national security concerns. So just like that, it's all over. No hard feelings. And all of this on the heels of what is almost sure to go down as one of the biggest product launch flops in company history. The timing of it all certainly leaves us with more questions than answers.

Unless they found a way to do the hack without actually pocessing a phone and clicking on those infamous 'human centipede' conditions of service agreements. Not hacking the phone is one of the agreements. I hope .GOV paid them enough, assuming this wasn't all kabuki.

Hasn't it already been well established that the govt records and keeps pretty much everything you do with a cellphone or computer? this was all just theater, done to keep the rubes thinking they have some semblance of privacy. Can't have a company as important to the stock market as apple taking a huge hit, that would disrupt the "everything is awesome" meme a little too much Mon, 03/28/2016 - 19:22 | 7374173 IndyPat Mon, 03/28/2016 - 20:31 | 7374366 RiverRoad Mon, 03/28/2016 - 20:17 | 7374360 DeadFred Of course I'm going to send some random site my password so they can 'test' it for security. QWERTY1 can never be hacked anyway.

Actually, it was because I was getting ulcers from Spotted Al Gore being on their board.

We'd have to print more money to fund them you fool! .gov and their Big Tech partners can access damn near anything.

Then everyone got what they wanted, Apple's illusion of security and the FBI an unlocked phone. Now they have what apperently announces that all IPhone are easily broken into as the current encryption techinques didn't take hundreds of years with super computers to break, it took months. And now that they know how to do it, it will only get easier to the point of inserting a flashdrive on your ICrap and it just unlocking. Shoulda just opened the phone. Tue, 03/29/2016 - 00:15 | 7375114 BigDawgz And what makes you so certain that Apple DIDN'T agree to help them break in?  There has been no mention of exactly WHO helped them, nor how they did it.  It's quite conceivable that Apple cut a deal that said "we'll help you break in but, in return, we get to make it appear that we're championing the privacy of all Apple owners".  It's a win-win...the gubmint gets the B&E help they wanted on the phone & Apple gets the "good guys" advertising boost at a time when the company is struggling.  There's plenty of sheeple out there that would go out & buy an iPhone the next time just because they thought Apple was standing up for them in this & was principled.
