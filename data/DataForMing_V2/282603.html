I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. 50% undervalued best idea for 2016 (newly off of embargo). Struggling to best compete with T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS ) and Sprint (NYSE: S ), Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) is working with Citigroup (NYSE: C ) on selling its data center assets. It is asking potential buyers for over $2.5 billion. Verizon is attempting to further streamline its business. The colocation portfolio up for sale includes 48 data centers. It has an EBITDA of about $275 million. CenturyLink (NYSE: CTL ) is a logical buyer. At the same time, AT&T (NYSE: T ) is trying to sell its data centers. CenturyLink is trying to figure out what to do with theirs. The most recent comparable deal was Windstream's (NASDAQ: WIN ) recent data center sale to TierPoint for $575 million. The European Commission approved the Berkshire Hathaway ( BRK.A / BRK.B ) acquisition of Precision Castparts (NYSE: PCP ). The $2.69 net arbitrage spread offers an 8% annual return if the deal closes by March. Halliburton (NYSE: HAL ) did not submit remedies or offer early concessions to European Union regulators by Tuesday's midnight deadline for its acquisition of Baker Hughes (NYSE: BHI ). The $11.54 net arbitrage spread offers a 76% annual return if the deal closes by May. ON Semiconductor (NASDAQ: ON ) extended its tender offer for Fairchild (NASDAQ: FCS ) for $20.00 per share in cash. The offer expires at midnight EST January 20th. In order to consummate a deal, ON will probably have to bump to around $22 per share. The preliminary proxy has been filed in connection to the Bank of the Ozarks (NASDAQ: OZRK ) acquisition of C1 Financial (NYSE: BNK ). The $0.82 net arbitrage spread offers a 10% annual return if the deal closes by May. Monsanto (NYSE: MON ) lost $0.11 per share, beating EPS estimates by $0.11; it also lowered its 2016 EPS guidance. Its $2.22 billion of revenue is down by about 23% year over year, missing by $190 million. The company is laying off more employees and cutting more costs than previously disclosed. Next? Probably an effort to reach a friendly deal to acquire Syngenta (NYSE: SYT ). More to come in future editions of M&A Daily ...
