ETF Hub Jul  9 2015, 19:48 ET | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Walt Disney's (NYSE: DIS ) $5.5B Shanghai resort -- its largest foreign investment ever -- is coming together with some distinct differences from previous parks, primarily a laser-like focus on Chinese culture at a place where adult visitors may outnumber children four to one. That's in part due to extended families traveling together, along with China's one-child policy that has crimped birth rates. The park adjusts seating, restaurants, viewing spaces and other adult hangouts accordingly. “We’re building something that’s authentically Disney and distinctly Chinese," Chairman Robert Iger says. Shanghai Disneyland is set to open next spring, within a three-hour drive of 330M potential visitors. The castle that will anchor the Shanghai park will be the biggest out of six, and topped off with a golden peony, beloved by the Chinese. It's no slam dunk -- competition is heavy with the number of amusement parks in China set to rise to 850 this year (up 40% from 2006) -- but Disney says it's learning from past mistakes. After being dinged for food choice and the small size of parks and lodging in Paris and Hong Kong, Disney's counting on heavy local food inclusion, and an upsized park with at least 1,220 rooms on site.
