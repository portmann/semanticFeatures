Ford Is Finally Succeeding In This Huge Growth Market - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford is finally gaining strong momentum in India this year as its sales have increased from last year on the back of an improvement in after-sales service and parts availability. Despite launching just one new model in the past year, Ford’s India sales have increased over 30% in the first half of 2016 as against last year. By expanding the parts distributor network and making part prices transparent on its website, Ford has managed to strike a chord with Indian customers who are finicky about after sales. A hike in salaries of 10 million people as a result of the Seventh Pay Commission will increase purchasing power in India, thereby leading to growth in auto sales. Ford is getting ready to tap the growth in the market by bringing out new India-centric products such as a mid-size sedan to target the fast-growing segments of the market. Ford's (NYSE: F ) stock has remained essentially flat for the past five years, and I believe that the company's ability to break past the range barrier depends on its international prospects. While investors tend to focus on Ford's prospects in China, the Indian automobile market also represents a great opportunity for the Blue Oval. Ford has been gaining market share in India, which is the good news for investors as India is the world's fastest growing major economy. As compared to Ford's global operations, India is a very small market at present. This is because it sold slightly more than 80,000 units in the country last year as compared to its total sales of 6.6 million units globally. However, the opportunity in the Indian car market is huge as it is the fastest-growing car market in the eight biggest auto markets, overhauling China and the U.S. This is the reason why Ford has buckled up in India and improved its performance drastically in 2016. In the first half of 2016, Ford's domestic sales have increased 30.5% over the sales achieved in the first half of the last year. The company saw one month of single-digit growth, three months of double-digit growth, and one month of more than 100% growth over the last six months. More importantly, Ford grew faster than the industry over the six month period and that's crucial. As a result of this rapid growth, Ford's market share in India has gone up from just 2.60% at the end of last year to 4.32% at the end of June. More importantly, Ford's sales have been growing quite consistently in India over the past few months and consequently, in the month of June, the automaker registered its highest ever domestic monthly sales for 2016 yet. The domestic sales for the first half of 2016 were 41,902 units while they were 32,115 units for the same period last year. Talking about total sales in June (including exports), Ford India sold 19,754 vehicles in the month of June 2016 as compared to 7,979 vehicles in June 2015. Exports grew 297% to 10,285 units from 3,452 units for the same first half period year-on-year. It looks like Ford has better understood the needs of the Indian customer, which is why without launching just one new model in almost a year, the company's sales have increased rapidly. The Indian buyer is highly-concerned about the service network, parts availability, and maintenance costs. Now, Ford has worked on these fronts of late and this is leading to results. For instance, in June, Ford expanded the distributor network of its Genuine Service Parts by appointing Khodiyar Ford Parts as the exclusive distributor for Gujarat, Daman, and Diu & Silvassa. By doing so, the company has strengthened its distributor base in key western areas of the country. Further, Ford plans to expand its parts distribution network soon into West Bengal, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Assam, and Punjab in the next phase, which will further improve its after-sales service. This is bound to increase customer convenience as they will have an easier access to fairly priced, high-quality Ford Genuine service parts which will strengthen the brand. Currently, Ford covers only Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Goa, Andhra Pradesh & Telangana with its parts distribution network. Thus, the company is going into overdrive as far as the parts distribution network is concerned, which is a good thing. In addition, the recent introduction of the Parts Price Calculator on Ford India's website is a feature that will allow customers to know the cost of all major fast-moving parts of Ford vehicles. This will give customers transparency about potential costs and will play an important role in the purchase decision. Moreover, the company has also reached 376 sales and service facilities in 209 cities across the country in April as it inaugurated new sales and services facilities several cities and towns. Under the three-pronged brand transformation strategy, Ford is also focusing on man-power development apart from introducing new products, addressing the cost of ownership perception, and delivering a differentiated experience to its customers. Along similar lines, the company has inaugurated its first independent technical training facility for the North region at Manesar, Gurgaon, and also partnered with Industrial Training Institutes in Hyderabad and Sonepat to establish Automotive Student Service Educational Training (ASSET) Centre(s). It seems Ford has garnered some early accolades on its way to brand transformation in India. Its total sales from Indian operations jumped impressively in June as discussed above, thanks to the company's new plant in Sanand and its focus on improving after sales. Unsurprisingly, Anurag Mehrotra, executive director, Marketing, Sales, and Service at Ford India is quite optimistic about the recent macroeconomic and political developments in India. He says, "The recent announcements of Seventh Pay Commission, along with the prediction of normal monsoon and scrappage policy are keeping the industry optimistic about future growth." Nearly 4.8 million central government employees and 5.5 million pensioners will benefit from the Seventh Pay Commission and this should act as a tailwind for the entire automobile market in India. This is because with a rise in pay, almost 10 million people will have increased spending power, which will complement the low interest rate environment prevailing in the country. However, the competition is fierce and Ford will have to make the right moves to continue its stellar growth. Its recent launches, such as the Figo and Figo Aspire, have received a rather lukewarm response in the market. This was a big setback which was an outcome of trying to cater to segments that were no more open to new entrants. These launches have been in segments that opened up between 2010 and 2012. To correct this basic flaw, the company needs to focus upon the more premium segments and introduce bigger hatchbacks or mid-sized sedans like Honda's City and Hyundai's Verna. The company does not have a presence in these segments. However, three years ago, the company did not have any car to offer in the compact SUV segment and then later delivered the EcoSport which turned out to be a winner. Hence, Ford is quite capable of coming out with winning products in new segments. In my opinion, Ford needs to bring a premium hatchback to compete with the likes of Hyundai's Elite i20 and Maruti Suzuki's Baleno (both of which are extremely successful), and also a sedan to lock horns with the likes of Honda City. These new launches could just prove to be those necessary elements required by Ford to complete the on-going process of brand transformation as the hatchback and the mid-size sedan segment are the big volume generators in the country, accounting for 72% of sales combined. The good news is that Ford seems to be focusing on these segments to come out with new products for India. For instance, it has been reported that Ford is developing a new sedan, codenamed Ford B500, for the emerging markets. More importantly, Ford has been said to be taking inputs from engineers in India to develop the incoming model, which is the right thing to do. As reported by Indian Autos Blog: "For the Indian market, a newspaper report stated that Ford India will invest around 4,000-5,000 Crores on a new R&D Center in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, and that the first project for this center will be the B500. For India though, Ford would be interested mainly in the sedan bodystyle, which will pit it against the Honda City, Maruti Ciaz and the VW Vento primarily." Therefore, it is evident that Ford is training its sights on volume-driven segments in India that will help it gain more market share going forward. In my opinion, Ford is following the right strategy for the Indian market. First, the company is laying the groundwork by improving its service and after-sales. Second, it is working on new products to target the fast-growing segments. I believe that this strategy will help Ford tap the fast-growing Indian market in the long run and grow its sales.
