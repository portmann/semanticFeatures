Facebook Extends Its Social Media Dominance - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Company produced EPS beat despite currency issues. Last week was not a pretty one for shareholders in the social media space. Shares of Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) and LinkedIn (NYSE: LNKD ) both dropped after their earnings reports. As a result, social media leader Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) saw its shares drop back into the $70s, despite a fairly decent report from Facebook a week earlier. In this article, I detail why Facebook has extended its social media dominance, meaning investors should take advantage of this pullback. Facebook's first quarter headline numbers were mixed, primarily thanks to the strong rise in the US dollar. You can review those headline numbers in the Seeking Alpha transcript of the company's earnings conference call . Even though revenues were hurt by currencies and this is a tremendous investment year for Facebook, the company still managed to produce a quarterly GAAP profit of $933 million. You don't see that happening at Twitter or LinkedIn. There were three important items when it came to the Facebook report. First, the company reported tremendous growth in its video traffic, which FBN notes as extremely important because video ad prices can be substantially higher. The second item is that the company reduced the top end of its spending guidance for 2015 on the conference call . Non-GAAP expenses, important for looking at analyst estimates, are now forecast to rise 50%-60%, down from previous guidance of 50%-65%. The third item is that Facebook showed strong growth in its average revenue per user metric in its largest region, the US and Canada. Year-over-year growth topped 42%, as seen in the chart below. The currency issue is something all names are dealing with. Right now, analysts are looking for just over $17 billion in revenues this year. That number would be a lot closer to $18 billion if not for the stronger dollar, so we'll see how the rest of the year plays out. It is good though that expense guidance was trimmed, so Facebook may be able to top $2 in non-GAAP EPS this year. Because of its decent profits, Facebook maintains a much better valuation than its social media peers. The company trades for about 40 times expected non-GAAP EPS this year. Twitter goes for more than 110 times its expected EPS, and that's after shares plunged last week thanks to a revenue miss and 2015 forecast cut. LinkedIn currently fetches about 100 times its expected earnings, and that's after that name's huge post-earnings drop and EPS forecast cut. Why would investors want to hold names that are disappointing when they can own Facebook which is doing quite well? Facebook shares were close to an all-time high into this earnings season. The slight revenue miss and bad reports from Twitter and LinkedIn has resulted in a decent pullback. Facebook shares are now below their 50-day moving average, as seen in the chart below. This has usually been a good time to buy. After the latest set of quarterly results, investors should be even more confident in Facebook. While the company did miss on revenues thanks to a stronger dollar, the bottom line result was strong and the yearly expense forecast was reduced. While other social media names are reducing yearly numbers and seeing their shares plunge, Facebook is producing solid results. A recent pullback makes the name even more attractive, and investors should seize the opportunity.
