Facebook Alters Its Advertising Model - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Facebook is out with news that is has changed how it defines and how it will track Cost Per Click or CPC. This is a big deal for Facebook, for its advertising and marketing partners, for content creators, and for its investors. Facebook is now defining CPC â€œto only include clicks to websites and apps, and not likes, shares and commentsâ€?. I think Facebook is doing this for a few reasons but all that dial-in to helping the company obviously drive the bottom line. Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) is out with news that it has changed how it defines and how it will track Cost Per Click or CPC. This is a big deal for Facebook, for its advertising and marketing partners, for content creators, and for its investors. I'll explain. First, Facebook is now defining CPC "to only include clicks to websites and apps, and not likes, shares and comments". Put simply, if you take a user off the platform it will be recorded. According to Facebook this is "intended to help advertisers better understand how their ads perform against their objective", which Facebook deems as driving a business goal such as in-store traffic and website clicks. I think Facebook is doing this for a few reasons but all that dial-in to helping the company obviously drive the bottom line. So, what does this change in definition do then? For starters it will make Facebook's advertisements appear to be more effective. Facebook notes this in its release today: "Once this change goes into effect, advertisers who care about link clicks are likely to see better return on advertising spend, since they'll be paying for only the most valuable outcome. Separating link clicks from engagement clicks (including likes and comments) means your budget will be spent more efficiently no matter if you bid for clicks or engagement." "As a result of this change, some campaign reporting metrics related to clicks may look different. By excluding likes, shares and comments, CPC may increase but will also become more valuable as it counts only the clicks you want. Similarly, it may look like your click-through rate (NYSE: CTR ) has decreased; again, this is because the CTR will no longer factor in the additional clicks." All told though the actual cost and underlying efficacy of course will remain unchanged and I think that will be fairly transparent to those paying for them. The platform is what the platform is. But, what this can lead to and what this hints are much bigger definitive pivots in the overall Facebook model. Separating the two metrics in definable silos can now allow Facebook to begin inflating its costs for Link Clicks at accelerated rates. Facebook now will be able to show in more granularity its direct effect on driving predictable outcomes. That's a very, very powerful leverage driver with advertising and marketing partners. This is going to become increasingly important as Facebook continues to shape its platform into a content creation and content/inbound marketing machine. Essentially, this is why Facebook spent the time developing and creating the final version of Instant Articles. Link Clicks will be the white glove product under Facebook's offering umbrella. Also, Facebook made very careful note that it would also include in Link Click price scheduling when a user clicks a call to action button. These are inclusive of buy now buttons, app installation buttons, and maybe most importantly newsletter and other consistent touchpoint buttons. I detailed Facebook's willingness to help drive these recurring touchpoint outcomes for advertisers and marketers just two weeks ago in a research note for Seeking Alpha. It appears this wasn't simply a Good Samaritan rollout, not that I was thinking that as indicated in my research note. I believe shortly it will be scheduled where these clicks are the most expensive for the platform, as they should be. The other thing that this presumably does is allow Facebook a less expensive menu item for SMB's or low ad-spend businesses that simply want to create awareness rather than an outcome. For instance, a company looking to build awareness for a product launch would have little use for a Link Click (unless taking pre-sales enrollments, etc.) but would have plenty use for a like, share, or comment - all variables that 1) drive awareness for the engaged user and 2) drive News Feed visibility by appearing more attractive to the Facebook algorithm. While complete speculation it's my guess that Facebook keeps these clicks at a lower costs as a way to introduce advertisers and marketers to the ecosystem. All told an advertising change at one of the biggest companies in the world is a big deal. I think this is a big deal in itself but also a big deal in what it means for Facebook longer term. This change directly contributes and positively moves forward my media company/content marketing bull thesis that I've shaped for readers over the last few months. It also should do well for my long-dated CALL options that are up a market pullback inclusive 32% in three weeks of ownership. If Facebook can pull off what I think it can by January 2017 I should be a lot deeper in the money than 32%. Source: Facebook Alters Its Advertising Model Disclosure: I am/we are long FB.
