Facebook Website Is Actually Doing Well On Costs - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Facebook posted a very good quarter and issued more positive OPEX guidance range. WhatsApp is the primary cause of the low earnings, but this is not a permanent issue. The market response to Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) earnings surprised me. The earnings beat estimates, and yet the stock was down due to rising spending. There are enough positive surprises in the Q2 earnings. Facebook narrowed the 2015 expense guidance from 55%-65% growth to 55%-60%. Also, Facebook beat analyst expectations and my own revenue estimates. The narrowed guidance is just a reflection of serious cost control efforts by Facebook. It seems like they are spending like there's no tomorrow, but they are in fact doing the opposite. Every of the four cost categories declined as a percentage of revenue over the quarter, with marketing & sales and cost of revue showing a major improvement with cost as a fraction of revenue declining (a relative) 10%. Table 1: selected quarterly earnings data. Source: company quarterly income statements and author's own calculations. The reason for the sharp year-over-year increase in costs is WhatsApp (acquired in October 2014). Facebook tries to divert attention away from this by providing a range of explanations why operating expense is higher, but the pro-forma net income including WhatsApp in the 10-K 2014 (p. 68) is telling. From this we can estimate that WhatsApp is spending over $2bn a year on around $25m (FY 2014) revenue. On top of that, Oculus is burning cash as well. This is why it might be a good idea to estimate Facebook's income excluding these acquisitions that give the impression that Facebook is not as profitable as it really is. Below are my earnings estimates of Facebook 2015-2020. The operating expenses are estimated by examining their development from Q1 2012 to Q3 2014 and comments in earnings calls regarding cost development. Because price increases faster than volume, this benefits the cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue and SG&A. For example, one assumption is that SG&A keeps up with the rise in Monthly active users, and cost of revenue trends to 12% of revenue. I think that the OPEX estimates of Facebook's website are still a bit high, but this leaves room for investments. Table 2: Facebook earnings estimates. The figures in blue represent estimates for the core-operations only (social networks). The historical numbers in black include acquisitions. Source: company annual income statements and author's own calculations. The estimates in the table above show what Facebook can (and probably will) do on its own. The network effect is very powerful and will spur revenue for years to come. Earnings visibility will be weak over the next years, but I look at Facebook as a website that acquired two cash burners. These cash burners probably will pay-off over time. Charging each user $4 per year would make WhatsApp cash flow positive. Waiting for monetizing WhatsApp until it has more users is a wise move, as the increased network effect makes switching harder for existing users. For my own valuation, I've written down the Goodwill paid for WhatsApp to zero, and regarded that to be the worst-case scenario. Table 2 above still lacks some explanation on revenue, which is actually based on figures in the table below. The table below shows estimates based on Monthly active users and ARPU (average revenue per user). An important foundation is that I expect the gap between US ARPU and ARPU in other regions to narrow. Not much is needed for this to happen besides the USD weakening to its 2013 level. Most notably, I assume ARPU to continue to increase, which is due to the continued investments in user experience and R&D. There is still a gap between ARPU of FB and LinkedIn (NYSE: LNKD ), while Facebook's users are much more active. And in 2014, Twitter's (NYSE: TWTR ) ARPU was 55% of Facebook's, while Twitter's users are less active and less engaged. In the long run, the $2bn drag on earnings is not proportionate to revenue, so earnings visibility will improve even if WhatsApp does not bring in revenue of any significance. That said, I do think that WhatsApp is worth more than nothing while in the meantime FB investors can enjoy the thought of fat cash flows from facebook.com.
