Multi-Fineline Electronix: An Extremely Undervalued Stock - Multi-Fineline Electronix, Inc. (NASDAQ:MFLX) | Seeking Alpha Multi-Fineline Electronix is scheduled to report its third-quarter financial results on November 05, nine days after Apple reports its results. Since sales to Apple accounted for 72% of MFLX's revenues in the last quarter, the results from Apple's report will affect the company's stock price in the short run. I see high growth prospects for the company also driven by the increased demand in wearables and especially for Apple Watch. Considering its compelling valuation metrics and its high earnings growth prospects, MFLX's stock, in my opinion, is extremely undervalued. Although MFLX's stock is up 65.7% year to date, in my opinion, it still has room to grow and is a strong buy right now. Multi-Fineline Electronix (NASDAQ: MFLX ) is scheduled to report its third-quarter financial results on Thursday, November 05, after the market close, nine days after Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) reports its fourth-quarter fiscal 2015 results. Since sales to Apple accounted for 72% of MFLX's revenues in the last quarter, the results from Apple's report will affect the company's stock price in the short run. Multi-Fineline Electronix engages in the engineering, design, and manufacture of flexible printed circuit boards and related component assemblies for the electronics industry. MFLX is well positioned to benefit from the growing demand for wearables devices. According to IDC, the globally addressable wearables market is projected to grow at an average annual rate of 43% in the next five years. Flexible printed circuits are well-suited for wearables given their complexity and need to be light and bendable. Source: company presentation September 2015 Flexible printed circuits are essential also for many other applications, including smartwatches, headsets, gaming devices, fitness bands, smart-clothing and medical devices. As such, we can expect growing demand for MFLX's products. On August 05, Multi-Fineline Electronix reported its second-quarter 2015 financial results, which beat EPS expectations by a large margin of $0.21 (75%). Net sales for the second quarter of 2015 were $152.8 million, an increase of 17 percent, compared to net sales of $130.8 million for the same period last year. MFLX showed significant earnings per share surprise in its last four quarters, as shown in the table below. "Our second-quarter results were in line with our guidance range and importantly, we consistently generated another quarter of strong profitability. This is our fourth consecutive profitable quarter under our new operating model, and we have now achieved significant profitability through a complete seasonal business cycle. This demonstrates that our new model can support profitability in both seasonally strong periods like the second half of 2014, as well as seasonally slower quarters." I see high growth prospects for the company also driven by the increased demand in wearables and especially for Apple Watch. MFLX showed impressive growth in the wearable space, growing year over year from effectively zero to approximately $16 million, or about 10% of net sales, in the second quarter. Smartphones accounted for 69% of net sales in the second quarter while tablet contribution was 13%. According to IDC, the global smartphone market is projected to grow at an average annual rate of 8% in the next five years. Year to date, MFLX's stock is up 65.7% while the S&P 500 Index has increased 0.6%, and the NASDAQ Composite Index has gained 6.3%. However, considering its compelling valuation and high growth prospects, the shares still have room to grow. Considering its compelling valuation metrics and its high earnings growth prospects, MFLX's stock, in my opinion, is extremely undervalued. Multi-Fineline Electronix generates strong free cash flow; its price to free cash flow is very low at 9.07, and the company has no debt at all. The trailing P/E is very low at 10.82, the forward P/E is also very low at 11.01 and the price-to-sales ratio is extremely low at 0.66. The PEG ratio is extremely low at 0.72 and the Enterprise Value/EBITDA ratio is exceptionally low at 1.63. According to James P. O'Shaughnessy, the Enterprise Value/EBITDA ratio is the best-performing single value factor. In his impressive book, "What Works on Wall Street," Mr. O'Shaughnessy demonstrates that 46 years of back-testing, from 1963 to 2009, has shown that companies with the lowest EV/EBITDA ratio have given the best return. The "ValueRank" ranking system is quite complex and takes into account many factors like 5-year average yield, sales growth, trailing P/E, price to book, price to sales and return on equity, as shown in Portfolio123's chart below. Back-testing over sixteen years has proved that this ranking system is very useful. The reader can find the back-testing results of this ranking system in this article .
