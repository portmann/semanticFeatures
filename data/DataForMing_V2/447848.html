AU Optronics: Improving Trends, Apple Evidence Building - AU Optronics Corp. (NYSE:AUO) | Seeking Alpha AU Optronics is benefiting from a recovery with several lasting factors. Purchase this week offers an immediate 3% return on capital. Almost two years ago, I wrote an article saying that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) would have to pay dearly to update its screen technology, which was one reason I saw an opportunity for AAPL investors to take profits or even use AAPL as a market hedge. That idea garnered a very nice profit , and despite criticism at the time, the world has come to accept the inevitability of the screen transition. In December of last year I wrote a PRO article documenting a possible collaboration between AU Optronics (NYSE: AUO ) and Apple. In the interim, AUO shares suffered heavily due to an earthquake in Taiwan and a broader market pullback. However, they have recently broken out. This article will examine how global changes in the screen market make the short-term breakout likely to endure. It will also update the long-term growth thesis for a return to double-digit stock prices. AUO has supplied best-in-class LCD panels for a long time, and is sales have rebounded from the February lows. I see that trend as being set to continue for at least the next few quarters for two main reasons: Supply: Many LCD suppliers, like Panasonic ( OTCPK:PCRFF ), have ceased LCD production entirely. Instead Panasonic will purchase AMOLED panels from the world's largest screen maker, LG Display (NYSE: LPL ). Others will try to fill the gap by using cadmium-free quantum dot material, which is produced by Dow Chemical (NYSE: DOW ) and sold by Nanoco ( OTC:NNOCF ). In the meantime, LGD and Samsung have begun to aggressively convert their LCD production lines to AMOLED manufacturing, leaving a dearth of supply just when demand is rebounding . Brexit: To my mind, one of the few lingering effects of the U.K. voting to exit the E.U. is relative currency valuations. This is because the real concern is about whether or not the event is a harbinger of further succession and eventual breakup of the Union. Thus we should continue to see a stronger USD and weaker Euro. Since AU's expenses are in New Taiwan Dollars, but its sales are in other currencies both the top and bottom lines should benefit. Over the long-term, though, I still believe that formidable development of and intellectual property on new transflective AMOLED screens will result in the greatest gains for AUO shareholders. My earlier article already documented AU's many achievements in this area, though I should have included the very first AMOLED phone in the list. To recap, AU Optronics is the ideal partner for Apple because, unlike other screen producers, it does not sell its own end user devices, and thus is not a competitor. Since the beginning of the year, the AU has gone on a major hiring spree to support a capacity build out. I see this as a sign of advancement for my thesis of on a long-term collaboration with Apple, via its secret lab in Taiwan employing former AU researchers. My best guess is that the first fruits will be a new version of the Watch later this year, and that new AU-developed screens will eventually move across entire product line. Using transflective hybrid AMOLED screens would allow Apple to claim differentiation from the devices we've seen so far. Thus, I think it's no coincidence that this screen type has started to see major development effort connected with other Apple suppliers recently, as well. As the manufacturing matures, AU will get a level playing field in mobile AMOLED manufacturing because of the introduction of inkjet printing. Kateeva, which is the leader in inkjet and flexible AMOLED manufacturing technology, is set to introduce its third generation systems this quarter, but they have not yet scaled up to larger Gen10 processes. This is another reason why I think LG Display is focusing mostly on its AMOLED TV monopoly in the interim; the use of soluble materials will l force the Korean incumbents will have to revamp their processes and recipes, even as it makes production dramatically more cost-effective. AU Optronics has both short- and long-term factors in its favor, not all of which are covered here. Those who purchase AUO in the coming week, before its July 7 ex-dividend date, can still earn an almost instant 3% on their investment thanks to the dividend payout, which is far better than you'd get with a household name like Apple. However, it's the patient long-term investors that I think will do best. Avoiding the tendency towards such names with high degrees of media coverage is one of the ways that smaller, individual investors can beat the market . The other is by digging deeper and successfully forecasting where companies and industries are headed. It's become generally accepted that Apple needs to update its screens, and AUO owns intellectual property that is likely to be crucial to the next generation of displays. Furthermore, it has a viable business with or without Apple, and is already building out capacity in a flexible manner. The first version of the Watch, which uses screens from LG Display, was an experimental step into AMOLEDs for Apple. However, the real race is just about to be run, and AUO appears to have the inside track. Disclosure: I am/we are long AUO, LPL. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
