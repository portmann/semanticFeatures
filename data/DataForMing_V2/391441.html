"We Are Disappointed" - Goldman Removes Apple From "Conviction Buy" List, Cuts Price Target From $155 To $136 | Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! The tide has finally turned on what until recently was every sellside analyst's favorite stock. With AAPL back in bear market territory and the stock back at levels last seen when the S&P was at 1820, it only makes sense for Goldman to take profit on its AAPL short position, which in this case manifested itself with a "Conviction Buy" call on the stock (for Goldman to short the stock, clients have to buy), and moments ago it closed out its "conviction buy" saying "we are disappointed by Appleâ€™s quarter and guidance, as it reflects a much weaker iPhone 6s product cycle than we had anticipated, with most of the negative surprise vs. our expectations coming from China", and cutting its 12 month price target on the stock from $155 to $136. We are disappointed by Appleâ€™s quarter and guidance, as it reflects a much weaker iPhone 6s product cycle than we had anticipated, with most of the negative surprise vs. our expectations coming from China. As such, we expect the shares to be weak in the near term, until the market gets comfortable around improving trends with the iPhone 7 product cycle. That said, we do not view the quarter as thesis-changing longer term, and maintain our Buy rating. In particular, we are encouraged by (1) Appleâ€™s new disclosure that its iPhone installed base is up 80% vs. 2 years ago, coupled with evidence in our US survey of significant pent-up demand for the iPhone 7, and (2) the acceleration in reported services growth to 20% yoy, with gross services up 27% - evidence of increasing monetization of Appleâ€™s platform. We now estimate 41mn iPhone units in F3Q, compared to prior GS/consensus at 47mn/44mn, with about a 2mn impact from the channel inventory reduction. We lower our FY16-18 sales estimates by 8%-9% on lower units/ASPs, and our EPS estimates by 11%- 14% to $8.40/$10.53/$11.42 on the additional impact of lower margins. We lower our 12-month price target to $136 from $155, based on 12.5X CY17 EPS (previously 15X on CY16E EPS), reflecting lower growth. Risks include product cycle execution, end demand, competition, and a slower pace of innovation. Appleâ€™s iPhone segment fell short of expectations in the quarter, as revenue of $32.9bn (-18% yoy, -36% qoq) compared to GS at $35.3bn and consensus at $33.2bn. Similarly, 51.2mn units were below our forecasted 53.6mn although modestly above Street at 50.3mn. ASPs of $642 compared to GS and Street at $659 driven by FX headwinds as well as a mix towards both mid-tier and entry-level iPhones (i.e., the 6 and 5s, respectively) in the quarter. Looking ahead to June, while management does not provide explicit segment-level guidance, it expects â€œseasonalâ€? sequential declines in iPhone sales. Looking at the trailing three-year average as a proxy for underlying seasonality, that -19% qoq decline would imply 41.2mn iPhone units. Management also expects iPhone ASPs to decline from March driven by the maturing 6s cycle coupled with the introduction of the lower-priced iPhone SE. The ASP mix in F3Q will also be negatively impacted by the $2bn planned channel inventory reduction, as that primarily impacts the higher-priced iPhone 6s models. We now expect iPhone unit volume of 213.9mn/246.3mn in CY16/CY17, representing yoy growth of -7.6%/+15.1%, respectively. Exiting the March quarter, iPhone inventory was within the companyâ€™s targeted five-to-seven week range; however, citing the â€œmacroeconomic environmentâ€? management intends to reduce company-wide channel inventories by $2bn in the June quarter compared to a ~$800mn reduction in C2Q15. The company expects the vast majority of that reduction to occur within the iPhone segment, which we believe is driven by disappointing sales of the iPhone 6s and some cannibalization by the unexpectedly popular iPhone SE, which is in short supply. Taking our C2Q16 iPhone ASP assumption of $620 and assuming that 95% of the $2bn reduction is iPhone, we calculate a 3mn hit to iPhone shipments in the June quarter vs. an estimated 1mn drag in the year ago period. Net-net, we expect a 2mn unit headwind which equates to a 4pt revenue growth headwind on a yoy basis from the planned channel inventory reduction in F3Q. On this quarterâ€™s earnings call, Apple disclosed additional information about the growth of its iPhone installed base as well as the upgrade rate relative to prior cycles. CEO Tim Cook said that the active iPhone installed base is up 80% vs. two years ago; note that Apple includes secondary market devices within its definition. In addition, the upgrade rate for the iPhone 6s is slightly higher than the iPhone 5s but lower than the particularly robust iPhone 6 cycle; this suggests that the yoy decline in the replacement rate we are seeing currently may be more due to difficult comps and a pull forward by the iPhone 6. We view these as positive indicators heading into the iPhone 7 cycle this fall, as we continue to expect a return to yoy unit growth driven largely by upgrades of the rapidly growing installed base. Recall that our survey of over 1,000 US consumers indicated that 44% of respondents intend to buy the iPhone 7 this fall which we view as a strong indicator of pent-up demand within the installed base.

They will print to bail out/ take over 'strategic sector' (energy) so maybe they just add to cart some of the crown jewels? You see whether they paint a beautiful picture that economy is all dandy (lying to us) or they eventually admit that economy is in the gutter - Janet will save the world and cut rates + QE.

I really don't know and I could easily be wrong but I always had the sneaking suspicion that they were made in the same factory (covert nightshift perhaps?)

When you miss this bad you gotta use every excuse available to you.  Maybe the weather was bad in China or something. Wed, 04/27/2016 - 07:20 | 7482202 GreatUncle That backdoor is going into iphones and there is no way you can stop it but to raise the argument they are hoping will quitely disappear raises consumer awareness of the issue. SHOUT NOW! BUY AN IPHONE, BUY AN FBI BACKDOOR INTO YOUR LIFE AND WITH NO OVERSIGHT COMMITEE TO ENSURE IT IS USED APPROPRIATELY. Comical really, all the other phones will have backdoors in anyway programmers do it to make sure they do not lock themselves out of a system the FBI just want to use if for nefarious means. Wed, 04/27/2016 - 08:35 | 7482432 Funn3r Doubt if Joe Sixpack (neÃ© Sheeple) is really concerned about FBI backdoor. He DOES care though about his iPhone costing over twice as much as his buddy's snazzy ChiPhone with much higher spec.  Wed, 04/27/2016 - 07:04 | 7482183 Bangin7PoundCocks The 4th quarter will be huuuge. New design always gooses the numbers and this is the first year after the introduction of the new 12 month trade-in policies at Apple Store and most major carriers. Long term may be a problem, but 4th quarter 2016 will break every sales record. Lock it in. when he looks in the mirror he sees obuma's face..do you understand yet? a defective mind is just that. when society turns over power to the deviate why do you expect anything other than chaos?

Piss off Bill, your forced upgraded windows 10 will destroy the branded company image. Nothing is free in life.

About a  year ago they went from providing the phone with a multi year contract to you make payments on the phone. Guess the payments didn't increase sales as much as the loss of people deciding not to upgrade. Whodda thunk it? Kind of like over taxed people can't buy shiny shit syndrome. There is a lesson in economic here somewhere. Wed, 04/27/2016 - 08:28 | 7482404 Wahooo Apple will close green today. Numbers were strong, just not algo strong. China demand is soft, no one saw that coming! Wed, 04/27/2016 - 08:34 | 7482430 buzzsaw99 they are going from a growth story to a dividend play which can be a dicey move when the growth seeking funds exit. Wed, 04/27/2016 - 08:42 | 7482463 buzzsaw99 they should make phones that self destruct after a certain period of time. that way people HAVE TO BUY A NEW PHONE. hahahahaha!

I thought we were told that for years, 'If you're a cool kid, you're all-in Apple stawk.' Apple iPhone 7 leak shows this device will be just another minor upgrade. Smartphones are all just too good and people will hold onto them just like ipads for years. Wed, 04/27/2016 - 09:01 | 7482547 TradingIsLifeBrah There is no leak its called a rumor and its completely made up.  Apple's phones don't get leaked, people just guess what will be in it to make clickbait articles.  The iPhone 7 won't be a "huge" update just like all the previous phones haven't been year over year.  You'd need to compare the phones over a 2 or 3 year cycle to see the updates which is how most people buy phones anyway.  Come on people this is just common sense. Wed, 04/27/2016 - 08:51 | 7482500 Atomizer Mrs Atomizer just approached me. We have a guy that sprays for Florida bugs. No contract. He's billing without consent. Told her to pay the $70 and have the jackass terminate any future visits in writing. She is on the computer as I type this.  These are the scumbags that fuck up our economy. I don't need to go to court over $70. This is how sick the United States of America is.  Wed, 04/27/2016 - 09:02 | 7482556 Sandmann Apple doesn't sell phones it use mobile operators to lease them. Trouble with that is the operator makes real money when the customer extends the lease rather than upgrade and there is not really that much more you can do to a telephone once it has a camera and a fondle-slab. There is no dynamic pricing from Apple and it you look at phone shops they are awash in Samsung and increasingly Huawei devices soaking up the Androids and no doubt with better retail margins Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! 04-27 8:48: US Advance Goods International Trade -56.90 (Prev. -62.86) 04-27 8:48: Latest Survation Brexit poll shows 38% to leave and 45% to remain 04-27 8:48: Franklin Resources (BEN) Q2 EPS USD 0.61 vs. Exp.
