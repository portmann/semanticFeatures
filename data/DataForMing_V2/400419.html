Immersion: The Good, The Bad And The Unknown - Immersion Corporation (NASDAQ:IMMR) | Seeking Alpha Immersion Corporation will report Q1 2016 results today after market close. The stock is on a downtrend, mainly caused by a lack of key news concerning the Samsung renewal or the Apple trial. Unknown equals uncertainty for the market. Behind the curtain, we noticed that thereâ€™s good and bad news. More revenues from Sony, but also a petition for review of a key IMMR patent used against Apple. Immersion Corporation (NASDAQ: IMMR ) will report Q1 2016 results today after market close. Recently, the stock has been on a downtrend, mainly caused by a lack of key news concerning the Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) renewal or the Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) trial. It is now not far from its 52 week-low. Immersion recently won an arbitration action against Sony (NYSE: SNE ) over a dispute on certain Sony Japan sales. Sony decided to dispute the arbitration decision and IMMR was forced to start a court action to have the arbitration reaffirmed. While most of the information is redacted, we believe that this award represents all upside for Immersion, as the company is now entitled to receive royalties for certain sales made by Sony in the Japanese market both for the past and the future. While the company, at our request, has made no comment as to the amounts involved, we believe that they may be material to allow the company to update its 2016 guidance. Amit Agarwal, a former patent litigator and now a full time investor, recently filed a petition that argues that numerous claims in Immersion's '356 patent are invalid. This is one of the three key patents that IMRR intends to use in its Apple lawsuit . In particular, Amit's petition quotes a previous patent application, n. 09/487,737 filed in 2000 (Rosenberg) and an IBM user manual of a 1994 product as prior art anticipating IMMR's patent application. If you are interested, you may download the full text of the petition at this link . Immersion anticipated that such kind of actions, either from Apple or some 3rd party, could be instituted, so the filing was not completely unexpected by management. We asked Immersion to comment on the situation, and the answer was: "We've looked at his IPR position and don't feel it is very compelling." Obviously, this is not good news for the company, although it could be anticipated that, especially in today's climate for patent infringements, petitions for invalidation of patents may represent the first defense step you can expect in most lawsuits. The uncertainties surrounding some key developments at Immersion (Samsung's renewal, status of the Apple infringement court case) don't allow for any stock appreciation, at the moment. The stock is stuck in a limbo, awaiting an event that will give it a direction - a kind of a binary option whose payoff can be very rewarding but only if you can make the right bet. We hope that the upcoming conference call, due for this evening, will give management the opportunity to update investors and share some additional color on the Sony court win and at least on the expected timing for the Apple case.
