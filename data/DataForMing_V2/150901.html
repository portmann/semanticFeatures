MFLX: An Attractive Wearables Market Play - Multi-Fineline Electronix, Inc. (NASDAQ:MFLX) | Seeking Alpha The combination of increased Apple revenue coupled with wearable revenue growth probably means MFLX is supplying components for Apple’s Watch. Apple, MFLX’s largest customer, was responsible for 72% of quarterly revenue. Wearable device revenue accounted for just over 10% of total revenue versus $0 a year ago. MFLX shares remain significantly undervalued. MFLX is positioned to grow top and bottom lines over the coming year, driven by sales of high-end smartphones and wearables. I’m maintaining my $33 price target, but I see potential to increase my earnings multiple in FY 2016 on the back of wearable device revenue growth. Multi-Fineline Electronix (NASDAQ: MFLX ) crushed its Q2 earnings estimates, delivering 49 cents versus 28 cents. Revenue was slightly above estimates, $152m vs $150m. Management guided for Q3 revenue between $155m and $185, affirming analyst estimates of $175m. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), MFLX's largest customer, was responsible for 72% of quarterly revenue. Another bright spot was wearable device revenue, which came in at $16m, or just over 10% of total revenue and up from $0 revenue a year ago. The combination of increased Apple revenue coupled with wearable revenue growth probably means MFLX is supplying components for Apple's Watch. Analysts may however perceive weakness in Q3 guidance that a sequential increase in revenues may be attended by lower gross margins due to product mix and program deployments. Investors should take a longer term investment strategy with MFLX and look beyond the current quarter and into the rapidly expanding and developing wearables market that MFLX is well positioned to serve. The werarables market is still in the early stages of a multi-year expansion cycle. CCS Inight has become increasingly bullish on 2018 after the firm upped its wearable forecast for 2018 from 135 million units ( August 2014 Report ) to 172 million units ( February 2015 Report ) (see images below). Smartwatches are expected to dominate the wearable market by 2018 with a 44% share or 77m units sold just edging wristbands (75m units sold/ 43% share). CCS Inight also estimated in February 2015 that Apple watch sales would account for over 25% of wearable devices sold in 2015 or 20m units. Recent estimates from July pegged Apple's share of the Q2 global smartwatch industry share at 75%. Apple's leadership in smartwatches within the wearable device market bodes well for MFLX going forward. MFLX's flexible circuits are ideal for both wearables and high-end smartphones, which will become thinner and lighter over time. Management confirmed that wearables represent a significant opportunity for the next 6 to 12 months as new programs roll out. High-end smartphones and consumer electronics are also requiring more flexible circuit content per unit, which means higher ASP per device and growing profits over time. MFLX shares remain significantly undervalued. MFLX is positioned to grow top and bottom lines over the coming year, driven by sales of high-end smartphones and wearables. Longer-term the trend towards lighter, thinner and even flexible smartphones should grow. As the wearable market grows and matures, MFLX will remain the lead supplier to major OEMs. I'm maintaining my $33 price target, but I see potential to increase my earnings multiple in FY 2016 on the back of wearable device revenue growth.
