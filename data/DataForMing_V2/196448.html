New Data Shows Ford Continues Momentum In Europe - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha It was just yesterday that we explain all of the different metrics that we are using as guide rails for our bullish thesis on ford. Yesterday, additional sales data from Ford Europe came in and, in keeping with data from both the US and the UK, it looks promising. It was just yesterday that we explained all of the different metrics that we are using as guide rails for our bullish thesis on Ford (NYSE: F ). We explained our birdseye thesis; primarily that continue demand in the US and strategic initiatives overseas would eventually help bolster Ford's bottom line. It is net income, and net income alone, that we think is going to drive the stock price at this point. Yesterday, additional sales data from Ford Europe came in and, in keeping with data from both the US and the UK, it looks promising . Ford Europe reports sales rose 8% in September on the continent as the subsidiary showed gains in 12 of 20 European markets. The company's volume leaders in Europe during the month were the Fiesta (37.8K), Focus (24.8K), Transit Custom (11.7K), and Kuga (9.6K). Again, commercial vehicles helped lead the charge (for consecutive months), up 12% in September and 26% year-to-date, according to the release. We explained yesterday that since we have put our bullish thesis out there, we are using things like the company's monthly sales metrics to keep a much closer eye on the company than one would get simply from reviewing the company's quarterly financials. We are pleased with these results from Europe and they are the latest in a long string of data that supports our case.

Also in the news was a headline that we had been paying attention to for the last week or so. The United Auto Workers in Detroit were in negotiations with Fiat and looking to potentially go on strike. While not completely catastrophic for Ford, this would have potentially led to a material impact on the company's business and we were hoping that Fiat was going to be able to resolve the issue. As of yesterday, it looks as if the company has avoided that landmine, which Ford and GM can use as a blueprint to avoid these issues. The United Auto Workers union has reached a tentative deal with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (NYSE: FCAU ) on a new four-year contract, averting a strike of the automaker's U.S. operations. Local UAW leaders will gather in Detroit on Friday to hear the details of the deal, while Fiat Chrysler's 40K union workers will have to vote again to finalize the agreement. If the pact is ratified, the UAW will likely use it as a template for negotiations with General Motors (NYSE: GM ) and Ford (NYSE:). Ford stock, as we said yesterday, continues with GM to rally and outperform the S&P 500 over the last few days. We continue to think that the company stock looks attractive here, as it is paying a 4% yield, and we believe the business is really getting traction both in the US and in international markets like Europe, the UK, China and India.
