Apple: 4 Was Not The Magic Number - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple did not hit $50 billion in revenues or 50 million iPhones sold. Stock sold off as guidance failed to meet analyst estimates. After the bell on Tuesday, technology giant Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) reported its fiscal third quarter results . Apple reported a solid quarter, well above its own revenue range, and beat analyst estimates on both the top and bottom lines. However, the numbers were not as good as some as hoped, and fiscal Q4 guidance was below estimates. That sent the stock lower, and produced headlines like the one seen below. As I stated in my preview article , "5" was the magic number for this quarter. Unfortunately, a number of "4s" did the company in. Apple sold 47.5 million iPhones in the quarter, a bit below many analyst expectations for more than 50 million. While unit sales were light, the company did increase its average selling price sequentially by $1.38, compared to a $35 sequential decline from Q2 to Q3 last year. On the conference call , Apple CFO Luca Maestri stated that the company reduced its channel inventory by about 600,000 units, leaving the company at the low end of its target inventory range. While sales may have disappointed, Apple still grew iPhone sales by 35% year over year, highlighted by 85% growth in Greater China. Another "5" that did not come was in terms of Mac sales, which came in just below 4.8 million units. As I detailed in my preview article, IDC's estimate that Apple shipped over 5.1 million units had many Mac figures rising. The Mac still grew year-over-year sales by almost 9% despite a 12% market decline. Apple finished the quarter below its target inventory for the Mac. Average selling prices rose a little more than 2%, most likely confirming my belief that global prices were increased to combat the stronger dollar. Overall, Apple reported revenues of $49.61 billion. That beat the Yahoo Finance estimate, but again fell short of the magic "5" mark. The company reduced total channel inventory by over a million units, and I estimate that cost Apple at least $650 million in revenues. Had inventory been kept flat, the company would have topped $50 billion in revenues, producing more than a "meager" beat. Don't forget that currency issues also hurt revenues about by about $3 billion in the quarter, including a $24 ASP hit for iPhones. The final "5" was the main reason for the demise in shares. Fiscal Q4 guidance was for revenues of $49 billion to $51 billion, while analysts were at $51.05 billion. I don't think investors should panic. The table below shows Apple's last four fiscal quarters where guidance proved to be quite conservative. Especially if management decides to refill its channel inventory, I wouldn't be surprised to see Q4 revenues end up above the current $51 billion plus estimate. (Source: Apple financial information page) Apple reported EPS of $1.85, which beat by four cents. Part of the beat was operating expenses of just $5.598 billion, a bit below the $5.7 billion guidance midpoint. $10 billion in the quarter was spent to buy back shares, more than I expected. This was one of the keys to the quarter, as management showed it really stands behind Apple shares. With this post-earnings decline, I'm guessing the company will come in as soon as its blackout period ends and use some of its remaining $50 billion repurchase plan. I can certainly understand the frustration investors are feeling after this report with shares down about $9 in after hours. When the company beats on the top and bottom line, investors expect shares to rise. This is especially true after Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) saw its stock soar last week, despite a revenue miss. However, I want investors to remember some of these key positives for Apple: The iPhone had the highest quarterly switching rate from Android that Apple has ever measured. Only 27% of Apple's installed base has upgraded to the 6 or 6 Plus so far. Phone ASP rose sequentially, the opposite of the $25 average sequential decline seen in the last four years from Q2 to Q3. The iPad sold nearly 11 million units, and Apple reportedly has 76% of the market for over $200 tablets. App store revenues increased 24% and more than doubled in China. Service revenues topped $5 billion, a record. Greater China revenues were up 112% overall. In the end, investors should be happy with Apple's results, but not completely thrilled. The stock sold off due to a number of key numbers starting with "4." With shares going into the report near their all-time high, this needed to be a great report. Good was not enough, with the decision to reduce channel inventory being key. In terms of guidance, remember that Apple guided basically in-line last time around and shares declined by $2 the next day. Between that report and this one, analysts increased their revenue average by about $2.25 billion, yet Apple still came in above that (and well over the top of its guidance). I personally think management has guided conservatively again as the table above showed for the last four quarters, especially ahead of its next iPhone launch. The pullback does provide investors a chance to get in at a lower price. The most recent pullback to the low $120s didn't last long, and I think that was during a time where Apple was blacked out from buying back shares. Management will step in when it can, and investors should too. While we might hear some analyst negativity in the coming days, just remember that even if the median price target drops by $5, it will still represent a nearly 20% increase from the last after-hours trade on Tuesday.
