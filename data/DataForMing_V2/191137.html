ETF Hub Oct  4 2015, 10:19 ET | By: Stephen Alpher , SA News Editor Raising ticket prices - as Disney (NYSE: DIS ) has done for years at well above the rate of inflation - won't fully solve issues associated with over-the-top demand around holidays and weekends, says Disney Parks and Resorts Chairman Bob Chapek, as the company would also like to boost attendance during slower times, and keep prices within reach of the 99%. Demand-based pricing is pretty common in the leisure industry, but single or multiday tickets at Disney's U.S. parks have always cost the same - whether on a beautiful Memorial Day weekend, or a rainy midweek day in January. Disney this week will begin asking customers about their feelings toward variable-pricing options. The company started tier pricing at Disneyland Paris last year, with prices now ranging from $64 for an adult ticket good only during "low season," to $94 for one which works all year long. I am blown away with how much Disney can charge for tickets.  Every time they do I think wow this is going to effect them and it never does.  They should just raise the prices for holidays and call it a day. IMO they will just make a killing as price just does not seem to stop people from going there. Wow, maybe Disney can start charging for using the bathroom facilities along with hidden extra fees for the use of toilet paper, worth a shot......... You're laughing but most non-US amusement parks DO charge for going to the toilet. Same thing with railway stations. Good luck finding a toilet where you don't have to pay for (ranging from 50ct to $1) Boardwalks in NJ have charged for public bathrooms for as long as I can recall going. Not all of them mind you but several going back as far as 20 years. I think the first time I used one I was maybe 10 and it was .25 to open the door. Well with Disney raising their ticket prices with a fallen economy me & the wife have decided to take the kids on a road trip to Wally World instead of Orlando. Thanks for assisting with the decision Disney. Makes good business sense - hotels do it, airlines do it, movies do it, sports events do it, and resorts do it -budget customers like a good discount for off season or during the week, affluent customers get their pick, will also reduce crowds on Holidays and weekends It makes perfect business sense. Disney is not talking about raising the cost of tickets but exploring the possibility of increasing parks attendance during non peak times. It's done in almost every business. These parks have massive fixed costs everyday, in regards to employees, maintenance, security, debts, electricity, etcetera. These costs don't really change whether there are a thousand or 100 thousand paying visitors. Yes, lower the ticket price, and accept ebt debit cards while your at it, that's the crowd you'll be catering too.
