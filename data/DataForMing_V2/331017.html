Micron: Management And Investors - Micron Technology Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) | Seeking Alpha Micron's CEO Mark Durcan intended to retire in August 2012. In a twist of fate, then Micron CEO Steve Appleton died in an accident. Durcan took over the next day. Superstar investors Seth Klarman of Baupost and David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital were among Micron's largest investors. Baupost now holds only a million shares. Greenlight has no position at all. Baupost believes Micron will widen its cost disadvantage relative to Samsung in DRAM. I strongly disagree. Micron's 20nm ramp will be quickly followed up by a 16nm ramp. By the end of calendar year 2017, Micron's cost/bit will be roughly on par with that of Samsung and cost/bit in 3D NAND to be ahead of the field. Intel and Micron are not breaking up. They are becoming more dependent upon each other. While still unlikely, an Intel/Micron merger is way more likely than a breakup. When Micron investors hear about Micron's (NASDAQ: MU ) management, a general sense of disappointment fills the room. The cast of characters has changed quite a bit over the last year. Former CFO Ron Foster resigned and was replaced by Ernie Maddock. Kipp Bedard, who has served as VP of Investor Relations since 1994, retired in January. Bedard was succeeded by Micron's long-time Senior Director of Investor Relations Ivan Donaldson. President Mark Adams resigned due to health reasons earlier this month. Micron has had a tendency of promoting veterans from within the company to its executive ranks. CFO Ernie Maddock has been a notable exception. While Ron Foster, Kipp Bedard and Mark Adams have caused some general resentment among Micron investors over the last few years (sometimes fairly, sometimes not), Mark Durcan, as CEO of the company, is most frequently blamed for the downfall of Micron's stock (in my view). The two guys in Micron's management team that I would like to focus this article on are CEO Mark Durcan and CFO Ernie Maddock. The story of how Durcan ended up becoming the CEO of the Boise-based semiconductor giant is one that involves tragedy striking in a small window of time. Durcan, a veteran of the company for over 30 years , started working at the firm as a Process Integration Engineer. He held many titles as he rose through the ranks at Micron including VP of R&D, President and Chief Operating Officer. On January 26, 2012, Durcan announced his plans to retire at the end of August 2012. Mark Adams was slated to take over as president and COO of the firm. At that time, Micron's CEO (and Chairman) Steve Appleton spoke fondly of Durcan's tenure at Micron. Appleton stated, "For the past 28 years Mark has played an integral role in the company's growth and success." He also said, "We appreciate his willingness to serve through the remainder of the fiscal year to ensure a smooth transition of his duties to his successor. We will miss Mark's leadership and guidance, and wish him well in his future endeavors." Durcan's plans took a 180-degree turn a week later. On February 3, 2012, Appleton died in a plane crash . Appleton was an aviation enthusiast and adrenaline junkie. He began his career after college at Micron in 1983. At the age of 34 and 11 years of experience, he ascended to the role of CEO and Chairman of the Board of Micron. This is a close to unbelievable accomplishment at a major semiconductor company not in its infancy. After successfully leading the company through multiple violent memory cycles that included numerous bankruptcies and mergers for a little less than two decades, finding someone to fill those shoes was an unenviable task. Only a few weeks before Durcan was set to ride into the proverbial sunset, an unfortunate accident put him in position to ascend to the position he likely coveted but was unlikely to ever get as Appleton was a rather young 51-year-old expected to lead the company for potentially another decade and beyond. Had the accident occurred several months later (or perhaps even just several weeks later) when Durcan would already be comfortably relaxing in retirement, perhaps Mark Adams (a Harvard MBA without an accompanying engineering degree) or a Micron insider with an engineering background would have become CEO of the firm. There's a possibility that an outsider from another semiconductor giant (such as Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ), SanDisk (NASDAQ: SNDK ) or Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF )) could have stepped into the role. There's no doubt that Steve Appleton would have remained CEO for as long as he wanted had he not been on that plane. With the timeline of events as they occurred, it is hard to imagine that Micron's list of candidates for the CEO position extended much beyond Durcan's name. Despite the fact that there was almost certainly no plan to ever allow Durcan to be the man in charge of Micron prior to April 3, 2012, he was quickly named CEO the day after Appleton's death. Praise is heaped upon a CEO when a public company's financials look great, future prospects appear promising and the stock price rises. Unsurprisingly, a CEO is vilified when results go the other way. This occurs whether the CEO's decisions are the primary driver that led to success or failure. While the fall in DRAM prices can be largely attributed to external factors out of the hands of Durcan's reach, the cost per bit of producing DRAM can be controlled by Micron's decisions. While it is clear that the 20nm ramp at Samsung and SK Hynix ( OTC:HXSCF ) was difficult, Micron began the ramp on 20nm much later than its rivals and the process has been excruciatingly slow. As a result of producing DRAM at 25nm and 30nm nodes while the competition was ramping 20nm, Micron's cost per bit for producing DRAM has been significantly higher than that of its Korean foes. Based on my conversations with friends (engineers) who have worked at Micron, it is clear that Mark Durcan is respected within the doors of Micron's facilities in Boise. After all, he was the technical expert at Micron during the era when significant R&D led to 3D NAND, 3D XPoint and other products. He is "one of them." As Bobcat9 noted in this comment , had the CEO of Micron been a sales and marketing guy (like Mark Adams), "EE types" would likely have unleashed unyielding diatribes that demanded his ouster immediately if he steered the ship that has led Micron to its current state. There were no serious objections at the last vote to keep Durcan on board as CEO. I can understand why. However, 2016 is going to be a year when Micron has to deliver. The fabled 3D NAND is here. It is time to show it's the real deal and prove that there is a clear path to cost leadership by the second generation 3D NAND in 2017. On the DRAM front, Micron has to speed up its ramp on 20nm and be on the heels of Samsung with a 16nm ramp as soon as Samsung moves toward 18nm. It is alright if 2016 ends up being a bloodbath so long as Durcan can show Samsung that advancing process nodes in the future for DRAM will have no hope of yielding excess profits. If all of this does not occur, and there's significant risk of at least one of these events failing to materialize, I strongly believe investors will begin to clamor for his removal. I have mixed feelings about Durcan as CEO, but I generally favor the idea of having someone new replace him. Ernie Maddock is the first breath of fresh air to enter Micron's executive ranks in a while. At a time when significant capital expenditures will be required over multiple years, a major acquisition in the works and multiple hedgeable risks emerge, the value of the CFO position at Micron has perhaps hit an all time high. When investing in small-cap companies, I believe looking at insider trading activity (particularly those with a capital C in their title) is important. It's less important to me when looking at an established company with well over $10 billion of annual sales. While there are many reasons a company executive may sell shares of the company he works at, there is only one reason to buy shares in the open market. I'll just copy an excerpt from a previous article I wrote that describes his trading activity of Micron's stock. "Maddock has made three open market purchases of Micron's stock. He bought 5,000 shares at $17.50/share in July 2015. He followed that up with a purchase of 10,000 shares in December at $14.32/share. As the price of the stock has fallen quite a bit more since then, Maddock accumulated another 10,000 shares at a little under $10.70/share." Maddock has repeated the message that there will be a significant turnaround in the second half of FY 2016. In this case, he has put his money where his mouth is. Unfortunately, it appears that Micron is headed toward a slow beginning of the second half of the fiscal year again. This article might more appropriately be called "Micron: Management and Former Investors." I believe looking at most 13-D, 13-F and 13-G filings is a waste of time. However, there exists a small group of investors whose opinions mean something to me. At or near the top of the list includes David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital and Seth Klarman of Baupost. In the world of hedge funds, these two are the equivalent of Magic Johnson and Larry Bird for those over 50, Michael Jordan and Hakeem Olajuwon for those over 40, or LeBron James and Stephen Curry for those just getting out of college. When a book (e-book) is written a century from now about the greatest investors of all time, it is highly likely that these two will be held in high esteem. As of the end of third quarter 2013, Baupost added to its stake in Micron and held a total of about 64 million shares . Over the last 25 months, the fund led by Klarman has significantly trimmed its position. Baupost sold over 98% of its shares of Micron and held only 1 million shares of the company at the end of 2015. As of the end of the second quarter 2015, Greenlight Capital had built its position in Micron to just under 38 million shares. Over the following six months, the fund under Einhorn liquidated its entire position in Micron. Overall, both funds earned significant profits by investing in Micron. Jim Mooney of Baupost explained why the fund had significantly reduced its stake in Micron. Mooney wrote "Our loss on Micron resulted from the fact that we remained overly optimistic about our long-term thesis after it should have become apparent that the company's widening cost disadvantage compared to its largest competitor, Samsung Electronics, would result in lower than expected profit margins. It also should have been clearer to us that the company was more vulnerable to the decline in PC DRAM pricing than we had believed. By the time we decided to sell nearly all of our remaining position, the stock was lower - a frustrating coda to an otherwise tremendously successful investment that achieved total lifetime profitability of over $900M." I wrote about Einhorn's line of reasoning in a previous article on why he liquidated Greenlight's entire stake in the fund. To summarize, Einhorn believes the cyclical nature of DRAM will remain and he missed seeing the peak and the turn in the cycle. He believes the historical patterns of memory company's over-investing in anticipation of future demand will continue. DRAM and NAND pricing also failed to meet his expectations in 2015. He also talked about the risk of a DRAM manufacturer emerging from China and the enormous capital expenditures that Micron has planned over the next few years. These two are living legends. I admire them more than I probably should. In this case, I strongly disagree with both of them. Micron's cost disadvantage in manufacturing DRAM is quickly narrowing as it is likely just a single-digit number of weeks away from bit crossover on 20nm DRAM. What's interesting to note is that Micron's team of Japanese engineers (former employees of Elpida, which was acquired by Micron) and Micron's American counterparts will collaborate on advancing to a new process node together for the first time on the 1X transition. Micron has struggled more than its Korean competitors on the 20nm transition. This time around, Micron is keeping within striking distance of Samsung and Micron has the potential to match its rival as the cost per bit leader in DRAM manufacturing over the next 18-24 months. (Well, at least that is the hope of Micron longs like myself.) On the surface, a race to shrink process nodes is bad news for the industry. However, cooler heads will eventually prevail once it becomes apparent to everyone that further shrinks will be immediately met with counterattacks that will prevent any opportunity to achieve above industry average gross margins in DRAM. The threat of advancing to 1Y will exist, but 1Y will be put on hold. When all three world powers (I am speaking of Samsung, Hynix and Micron here) have access to launch nuclear attacks on each other, I suspect they all will choose a more peaceful route that leads to greater stability and profitability. During the Q&A session of the Winter Analyst Day conference, Micron management noted that the 1X process node enablement for DRAM is a high priority during the year. It also seems that the company intends to ramp this technology much sooner than many had imagined. Micron indicated that in the cases where the 25nm to 20nm transition was not complete, it is likely that Micron may immediately upgrade 25nm lines to 16nm ones. Considering where Micron currently is on the 20nm ramp, that puts the timeline of when DRAM bits using the 16nm process node will start appearing at sometime during calendar year 2016. There is a small chance that we could see 16nm DRAM bits at the tail end of FY 2016 or early FY 2017. Samsung expects to begin mass production of DRAM on the 18nm process node sometime around the middle of the year. If Micron ramps 16nm when I expect (assuming Samsung begins an aggressive action toward migrating to 18nm), Micron will achieve cost parity with Samsung on DRAM in 18-24 months. Achieving cost parity in DRAM and a cost per bit edge in 3D NAND is a distinct possibility for Micron in the second half of calendar year 2017. The last topic I want to mention is the relationship between Micron and Intel. Intel has a vested interest in the success of Micron. In Stephen Breezy's Micron and Intel: Occam's Razor , Breezy states his belief that Micron and Intel are going through a messy breakup. I strongly disagree with this assessment. On the contrary, I believe Micron and Intel's relationship is growing stronger and their dependence on each other is increasing. Occam's Razor, in short, states that the hypothesis that utilizes the fewest assumptions is preferable over one that uses requires more assumptions. I will apply Occam's Razor to the current and future relationship of Intel and Micron. Micron and Intel have a long relationship of working on research and development efforts together. The story of the relationship between these two companies began in 2006 with the formation of their joint venture, IM Flash. Here is a timeline of some of the major events of this joint venture. There have been three major developments created by this union of two of America's semiconductor giants. These three developments, in chronological order of when they were revealed to the public, are: planar NAND, 3D NAND and 3D XPoint. Planar NAND profits have been disappointing and this technology is quickly on its way to obsolescence. The 3D NAND ramp has begun and bit crossover with planar NAND is only a couple months away. The further scaling of 3D NAND in the z-dimension has not begun yet and the pace of the drop in cost per bit will accelerate over the next two years. 3D XPoint was jointly developed by Intel and Micron and we are still at least several months away from seeing it in action and at least a few years away before the technology starts to mature into a multi-billion dollar profit stream. It seems inconceivable that Intel and Micron could be working on a "divorce" after spending billions (and plans to spend billions more) to develop and build capacity for their two landmark breakthrough technologies before they even see meaningful sales from either technology. On top of Micron and Intel's joint effort in non-volatile memories, the two also have worked on developing MCDRAM (a variant of the fabled HMC (Hybrid Memory Cube) to be used as the high-bandwidth on-package memory solution of Intel's Xeon Phi. In Micron's most recent 10-Q, there is an interesting note on page 19. "The IMFT joint venture agreement extends through 2024 and includes certain buy-sell rights. On January 5, 2016, we amended the Second Amended and Restated Operating Agreement with Intel related to the IMFT joint venture to change the dates of those buy-sell rights. Pursuant to this amendment, commencing in January 2016, Intel can put to us, and commencing in January 2019, we can call from Intel, Intel's interest in IMFT, in either case, for an amount equal to the noncontrolling interest balance attributable to Intel at such time. If Intel elects to sell to us, we can elect to set the closing date of the transaction to be any time within two years following such election by Intel and can elect to receive financing of the purchase price from Intel for one to two years from the closing date." This effectively pushes back the dates in their previous agreement by one year, which guarantees the relationship will remain intact for at least one additional year beyond than what was implied in the previous deal. And to be clear, I expect Micron and Intel's relationship will expand and extend beyond 2019. Intel and Micron jointly develop technology but also potentially compete against each other in the marketplace. That creates an unusual dynamic where some profit-motivated actions by either party will be perceived as a move toward a breakup. At a Raymond James conference in September, the now retired Kipp Bedard (VP of Investor Relations at Micron at the time) stated that Intel was possibly looking to manufacture 3D NAND separately from its joint venture with Micron. The news of Intel's planned investment in Dalian should not have been shocking. In a previous article , I stated that Intel's desires to build additional fab capacity (before the Dalian announcement) as "not a sign of a breakdown in the Intel and Micron partnership. This is a result of Intel's expectation of demand for 3D XPoint and 3D NAND to be so high that Micron's wafer capacity will be completely exhausted well before it is able to produce enough wafers to meet the market's huge demand for these two new non-volatile memories. That is the ultimate bullish statement and bodes extremely well for Micron's long-term prospects if reality is anywhere close to Intel's expectations." Micron and Intel's relationship is analogous to that of long-time best friends and business partners. The businesses are getting more intertwined over time. By applying Occam's Razor, the conclusion to draw using the fewest number of assumptions is that the two will continue their fruitful relationship. It is far more likely that Intel will acquire an equity stake in Micron than it is for the two to split up. While unlikely, the marriage of Intel and Micron (a merger) also is more likely than a breakup. Over the last few months, I have pushed back my expectations of when Micron will begin a massive turnaround. It is difficult to see that one has entered a value trap until well after the fact. I now believe we are headed toward a rough few months ahead in the business, but I also see this as being more than priced into the stock. I have unloaded my call options in Micron over the last week, but I have kept my much larger stock position intact (which I doubled down on in the single digit and sub-teen range during February). Baupost's Mooney stated, "In investing, however, there is no umpire calling balls and strikes, and in retrospect we could have been even more patient at the plate. What had, for many investors, been a growing pool of red ink during the year turned into a bloodbath by year-end. To repurpose Warren Buffett's famous quote about managements and businesses, when a talented investment team confronts an exceptionally challenging market, sometimes the market wins (at least in the short run)." In the case of Micron, there's no doubt who has been winning right now. I want to make the case that the game is far from over. I firmly expect Micron longs to end up big winners at the end of this game. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
