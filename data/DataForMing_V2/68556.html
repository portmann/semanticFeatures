Ford Motor Company Is A Great Opportunity For Value Investors - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford is suitable for Enterprising Investors but not Defensive Investors following the ModernGraham approach. According to the ModernGraham valuation model, the company is undervalued at the present time. The market is implying a 0.69% in annual earnings growth over the next 7-10 years, which is significantly less than the growth the company has seen in recent years. Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F ) has shown very strong earnings growth over the last several years, which when combined with the company's high dividend yield will immediately intrigue many investors. For example, Orange Peel Investments recently justified a long position based on strong overseas and capital investment . Similarly, Christopher Salerno believes in the company's management despite some concerns about the plans to grow efforts in the Russian market. These are great qualitative concerns that must be taken into consideration when making investment decisions. However, Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, taught that investors must take emotion out of the equation, as the most important aspect to consider is whether the company is trading at a discount relative to its intrinsic value. It is through a thorough fundamental analysis that the investor is able to make a determination about a potential investment's merits. Here's a look at how the company fares in the ModernGraham valuation model. The model is inspired by the teachings of Benjamin Graham and considers numerous metrics intended to help the investor reduce risk levels. The first part of the analysis is to determine whether the company is suitable for the very conservative Defensive Investor or the less conservative Enterprising Investor, who is willing to spend a greater amount of time conducting further research. In addition, Graham strongly suggested that investors avoid speculation to remove the subjective elements of emotion. This is best achieved by utilizing a systematic approach to analysis that will provide investors with a sense of how a specific company compares to another. By using the ModernGraham method, one can review a company's historical accomplishments and determine an intrinsic value that can be compared across industries. Adequate Size of Enterprise - Market capitalization of at least $2 billion - PASS Sufficiently Strong Financial Condition - Current ratio greater than 2 - PASS Earnings Stability - Positive earnings per share for at least 10 straight years - FAIL Dividend Record - Has paid a dividend for at least 10 straight years - FAIL Earnings Growth - Earnings per share has increased by at least 1/3rd over the last 10 years, using 3-year averages at the beginning and end of the period - PASS Moderate PEmg (price over normalized earnings) ratio - PEmg is less than 20 - PASS Moderate Price to Assets - PB ratio is less than 2.5 or PB x PEmg is less than 50 - PASS Enterprising Investor - Must pass at least 4 of the following 5 tests or be suitable for a Defensive Investor: Score = 5/5 Sufficiently Strong Financial Condition, Part 1 - Current ratio greater than 1.5 - PASS Sufficiently Strong Financial Condition, Part 2 - Debt-to-Net Current Assets ratio less than 1.1 - PASS Earnings Stability - Positive earnings per share for at least 5 years - PASS Dividend Record - Currently pays a dividend - PASS Ford Motor Company performs well in the ModernGraham model and is suitable for Enterprising Investors. The Defensive Investor is concerned with the inconsistent dividend record and the lack of earnings stability over the last ten years, while the Enterprising Investor has no initial concerns. As a result, Enterprising Investors should feel very comfortable proceeding to the next part of the analysis, which is a determination of the company's intrinsic value. When it comes to valuation, it is critical to consider the company's earnings history. In this case, the company has grown its EPSmg (normalized earnings) from $1.30 in 2011 to an estimated $1.55 for 2015. Even though this is not a very high level of growth, it is well above the market's implied estimate of only 0.69% annual earnings growth over the next 7-10 years. Here, actual growth in EPSmg over the last several years has averaged 3.8% annually, so the market is expecting a very significant drop in earnings growth. The ModernGraham valuation model reduces the historical growth to a more conservative figure, assuming that some slowdown will occur, but still estimates a growth figure much higher than the market's implied rate. Therefore, the model returns an estimate of intrinsic value well above the current price, indicating the company is significantly undervalued at the present time. Enterprising Investors should take this information regarding the company's valuation and proceed with further research into whether the company would be suitable for individual portfolios, as it has passed a ModernGraham review.
