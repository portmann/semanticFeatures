Walt Disney: Should You Be A Bear Or Bull? - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. DIS is a superbly well-diversified media giant with a brand appeal few can match. Headwinds face the business from ESPN to flat studio revenues, but they are more than able to handle these. Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS ) is a remarkable company. The "House of Mouse" has, for most of us, been part of our lives in one way or another for generations with little sign this will end soon. Few could (or would) claim that they haven't enjoyed watching something which has come out of its doors. However, the business is much more than just the much-loved film and TV characters from Mickey Mouse to Frozen. Its consumer and parks empire piggy-back off its film and TV productions as well as its wide-ranging media networks offerings including ESPN, ABC and, of course, the Disney Channels. After years of almost unbroken upwards share price movement it has recently suffered sharp volatility as bullishness in its business model has been questioned and queried. But how justified is this? And should you consider buying into the business today? I take a look at a few of the bear and bull cases below and try to ascertain which (if either) have a stronger case whilst also where appropriate compare it with some of major media peers.* I will then try and get a feel for what I think the fair value for Disney is right now. As the share price reflects, the number of Disney bears (you can insert your own Winnie-the-Pooh, Baloo or other Disney-related bear puns here...) has increased recently. So let's take a little look at what has made them and me think a little bearish first. First, the most prominent one: ESPN subs falling. Certainly it is the case that ESPN subscriptions have been falling noticeably over the last five years: With talk of the cable-cutting revolution, few see this decline as likely to be slowed. This is, of course, a worry to many as the media segment--of which ESPN is a notable constituent--represents by far the largest revenue segment for the business: The bears certainly have a valid point. Something will need to be done about the ESPN subs declines. Either they are reversed or stabilized or more drastic action will have to be taken over the long-term. Nonetheless, as we will see later, it is not time to over-exaggerate this situation. Others have highlighted a further cause for worry: Flat underlying revenues at Disney's studio segment. Clearly Disney has many massive names in its studio stable. As well as the eponymous Disney Studios there is also the Pixar, LucasFilm and Marvel Studios thrown into the mix. Nonetheless, despite its strong collection of studio brands there has there has been only modest movement upwards in revenue despite a number of films coming out of both established and newly-created or newly-acquired franchises in recent years: Needless to say, this flat revenue despite the addition of LucasFilms in 2012 has meant that the studio segment has shrunk in its revenue contributions to the business since 2011: With it now (at FY2015 time) contributing only 14% of group revenues it has clearly struggled to keep up with the rest of segments with regards to growth. Another potentially bearish sign is the amount of capital expenditure that Disney is having to pump into the business. Of course, this inevitably eats into the FCF of the company: Disney's CapEx does seem disproportionate to its peers when we compare the amount of FCF that its being produced from the company's operating cash flow: Disney has improved in recent years, but remains well behind its peers. For some this may offer an opportunity for enhancing FCF by cutting back on excess capital expenditure. And, of course, it does if Disney is able to cut back its CapEx. Some would also argue this is all compounded by a lackluster yield. Certainly, in some regards they would be right. From a simple dividend perspective Disney has lagged its peers: Both their current and FCF yield is lower than their peers and their FCF payout ratio is running a little higher. Disney's buyback yield over the last five years has been comparatively modest. In contrast, several of its industry peers have been engaging in much more extensive buyback programs. Another bearish position has been regarding its valuation. Of course, this feeds into the disappointing dividend yield. Despite EPS growth expected to come both this year and next Disney remains overvalued against its peers, according to the bears: This is certainly the case. But depending on whether you think the bear or bull case is strong with Disney will color how you see this higher valuation. So let's see what the bull case throws up. Despite the bears growing in number of late, Disney still attracts a majority of long-term bulls. So let's analyze whether their case is better than the bears at the moment. Consistent Revenue Growth (Both Past and Future) First, let us start with the revenue situation. Disney's revenue growth in the past has been impressive compared to its peers: Nor is this expected to slow anytime soon. Over the next two years, the consensus predictions suggest that Disney will continue to outperform its peers: This is great news for investors, suggesting that Disney will continue to be a peer-leading media business. But what about those headwinds? The revenue growth matter raises an interesting point against the bears. Think this through with regards to ESPN subscription falls. Revenue has continued to grow, and at some pace during the ESPN falls (here I have totaled all ESPN subs): It is easy to get caught up in the macro trends which many see as calling the demise of the cable age. But the reality is that, for Disney, although hardly something they are looking to see, the subs falls have been hardly catastrophic for revenue up to now. Indeed, the media segment itself (in which ESPN is a part) has seen revenue continue to grow. The brands, including ESPN, are strong with great pricing power even on the back of declining subs. Similarly, the other major members of the segment are doing much better: Nonetheless, the ESPN situation is one to be watched and, undoubtedly, acted upon if it does not improve or stabilize. Some have argued that Disney has about 5 years to play with regarding ESPN subs : With strong pricing, we believe ESPN profits can remain relatively flat over the next five years but, in the absence of a convincing [direct to consumer] model, declining subs will lead to significant profit contraction at the unit over the following five years. I don't disagree with this. Disney has plenty of room for maneuver even with the worst case scenario for ESPN subs--for now. I do believe they can retain a strong revenue and income profile from ESPN for a little while yet courtesy of their strong pricing power. What the long-term future is for ESPN at Disney, I do not know. But in the meantime, to over-exaggerate the effects of it on the performance of this supremely diversified media giant is rather shortsighted. Another argument could be made that the studio segment is clearly a lumpy one. Revenues lurch from blockbusters to box office flops with a vast array of variety in between. But, I'd argue that relationship between the studio and consumer segments is very important. With its use of studio-generated characters as the raw materials for its own commercial productions, the consumer/studio relationship is close. The consumer segment, therefore, balances out some of the more lumpy blockbuster boom or bust cycle from the studio segments revenue: Looked at from this perspective the fairly flat studio revenue is maybe less concerning (if you considered it concerning in the first place). Now, let us really sink our teeth into the fundamental performance of the business itself. It is here that it is easy to become bullish on Disney. Disney has managed to leverage its, frankly, staggering brand power to achieve margins that shunt its peers into the shade. Over the last five years, its operating profit margins have consistently edged or leaped ahead: This is impressive and bodes well for the future. Clearly people are still willing to pay premium prices for their Disney products whether it be sports channels, films, toys or a park holiday. How much more opportunity for margin expansion there is available to Disney is not entirely clear. However, what is clear is that they can achieve and retain high margins over prolonged periods. Watching these margins in future earnings reports will be, of course, important. Disney is fundamentally sound elsewhere as well. Take a look at its debt position. Its debt to equity ratio is considerably below that of its peers: This combined with its impressive FCF performance means that it also has a solid FCF coverage of this debt (a key metric I look at): In other words, Disney could (theoretically) repay the entirety of its debt off using just its FCF in a little over two-and-a-half years. in contrast, its peers would struggle to do the same in under seven years. The simple fact is that Disney is fundamentally strong. It is little surprise, therefore that they are highly regarded by the major credit rating agencies. Compared to its major peers, it attracts very generous credit ratings from them all ( to read how I normalize credit ratings, head here ): Overall, this leaves Disney looking on a very secure financial footing going forward giving it plenty of scope for facing up to any further headwinds coming its way. All very encouraging. Impressive Cash-Generation Efficiency Disney has also proven itself a highly capable producer of cash. Take a look at its cash return on invested capital (that is, CROIC) which is its FCF divided by the sum of its debt and equity. Since 2013 Disney has easily outperformed its peers despite starting the period as the laggard: Since 2013, it has managed to produce about $0.10 to $0.11 in free cash for every $1 invested in the business. This is very impressive indeed. It will be interesting to see whether when the quarterly results come through in FY2016 they manage to retain this efficiency. This is something to look out for, certainly. All of this puts the valuation and thus dividend in perspective. Disney continues to be a high-performing, well-diversified media giant with strong fundamentals which push it ahead of even its strongest media rivals such as ComCast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ). Its valuation relative to its peers therefore seems pretty fair. In turn, it is therefore understandable that its dividend runs a little lower than its peers too. On the buyback front, some of Disney's peers have been criticized for their more forceful buyback policy [ Viacom ( VIAB )], in particular) in light of their elevated share prices. Indeed, Disney has been running ahead of its peers with regards valuation for some years (over the last five years its average PE ratio has sat at nearly 19.5 compared to the 13 and 18 range of its peers). In such light, it seems perhaps wise that Disney's recent buyback history has been more modest. So what camp do I fall into? On this occasion I have to say I am bullish on Disney. It continues to produce impressive revenue growth despite headwinds. It also continues to perform ahead of its rivals in almost every metric you can throw at it and its supreme, distinctive brand power makes it stand out from its rivals. If I was to apply the same historic PE valuation it has averaged over the last five years to future predicted EPS then I would be given a fair value price of around $115. It was trading around this price late last year and this does not seem unduly unreasonable in many regards. However, for me I am more interested in its valuation compared to its FCF. Over the last five years it has averaged an EV/FCF value of around 22.8 which I will use as my EV/FCF fair value multiple. With revenue expected to grow at a CAGR rate of about 6% over the next couple of years we can start trying to work out its FCF fair value. Now, using the average FCF/Revenue ratio from the last five years (11.8%) and that of the last FY (11.8%) would give us a guideline FCF/Revenue figure of 12.23%. By plugging this 12.23% FCF/Revenue figure into the predicted revenue figures for the next two years we are provided with predicted FCF figures of about $6.851 billion and $7.251 billion for this year and next. My EV/FCF fair value based on these predictions would therefore suggest a price of $92.54 as a fair value for Disney at present (slightly below today's price). I think this sounds about right in light of the challenges. With the likely continued volatility leading into the Q1 2016 earnings release early next month, we may just see this fair value price target arrive shortly. * The peers on this occasion are: ComCast, CBS (NYSE: CBS ), ViaCom (NASDAQ: VIAB ), 21st Century Fox (NASDAQ: FOXA ), and Time Warner (NYSE: TWX ).
