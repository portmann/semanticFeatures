Estimates Of Apple's Q1 All Over The Map - Investors May Need A Map Out Of The Confusion - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in AAPL over the next 72 hours. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. Evidence of soft iPhone sales in the December quarter are adding to pressure on Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) shares despite the stubborn optimism of SA Authors like Mark Hibben and Bill Maurer who continue to plug Apple shares as bullish bets while watching the AAPL stock hover around $100. Hibben continues to assert that Apple's less than 15% global market share can be considered "dominance." Mark Hibben is the most bullish I have seen, calling for 79 million iPhones in the latest quarter, a number he calls conservative. Hibben bases his estimate on the rapid growth of 4G smartphones reported by major Chinese carriers. We will soon see whether Hibben is right or not, but I am doubtful. "Chinese smartphone brands had an 81 percent share of total 4G smartphone shipments on the mainland last month, according to Bernstein." There seems little doubt that of the 19% supplied by non-Chinese vendors, Samsung and HTC will take a meaningful piece with the iPhone likely making up much of the balance. Give Apple credit for half the 4G market not supplied by Chinese vendors and accept Hibben's estimate of 64.6 million 4G phones sold to Chinese users in the quarter and you have the iPhone with about 7 million units, a far cry from Hibben's 13 million estimate. I have no doubt Apple will report a higher number based on some inventory build during the period since I am confident the company shipped into what it thought would be buoyant demand. The latest indicator of an iPhone slowdown more broadly is a study by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners ("CIRP") showing that iPhone's share of U.S. activations in the December quarter dropped to 41% in 2015 from 50% in 2014. Quarter over quarte,r iPhone's share of U.S. activations rose in 2015 following the launch of the iPhone 6S Plus and 6S models, but by quite a bit less than the comparable period in calendar 2014. As a result I see weak results as likley. An article in Barron's came to the same conclusion via a different route, noting that Apple's current Q1 softness likely contains a higher mix of older models adding to the possible volume malaise by contributing to a lower average selling price. This year sales of the latest models comprise about 67% of units sold compared to 75% in the 2014 period, according to UBS data referenced in the Barron's piece. UBS sees weak sales continuing into the March quarter. Apple will release the quarter's results next week and investors can update their models with actual data, which, in my opinion, will show as Q1 sales an inventory build of 1 or 2 million units somewhat mitigating the effect of lower sales to end users. Apple recognizes income when iPhones are shipped to carriers and not solely when they are sold through to end customers. Apple's iPad and MacBook lines are heading into a pretty flat outlook for these more traditional devices where Gartner sees little growth outside of the Ultramobile (Premium) segment where demand for Windows 10 based 2 in 1 devices expected to contribute to higher unit shipments. Gartner sees no growth at all for the Ultramobile (Basic and Utility) segment where iPad and iPad mini models show up, suggesting the downward trend for these devices is likely to persist. I believe we have now reached a maturity stage in computing devices generally and smartphones and tablets in particular, with very little likelihood of any meaningful growth for the next few years. Companies seeking to increase sales will have to do so at the expense of a competitor by and large and those wars often result in lower prices or flat prices with more content in each device to lure customers. Neither is constructive for the device suppliers. As we approach Apple's Q1 earnings release, analysts are ratcheting down investor expectations with a focus on Apple's progress in China a key determinant. Not all investors are willing to wait and see, with growth funds dumping Apple stock in significant volumes already in the fact of the mounting evidence that growth will be hard to come by for the Cupertino giant. Investors betting on a late December surge in iPhone sales or an uptick in early 2016 are likely to be disappointed. The flood of press coverage of suppliers cutting production is to some degree confirmed by Fiksu.com data which show the rate of uptake of the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus continues to lag their predecessors by a wide margin. Next week's release may be a come to Jesus moment for the Apple bulls as actual results and guidance inform the investing world as to what the trend has become, and if it is as negative as these pointers suggest the emergency evacuation of this leaking ship could be headline news. I agree with the latest commentary on Apple on CNBC - Someone is going to be proven very wrong. I suspect it is the bulls. I'm out of Apple for the moment but expect to short into the current spike higher and in any event before the earnings come out. Tagged: Investing Ideas , Technology
