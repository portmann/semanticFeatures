Amazon Prime Day 2016 Deals, Wal-Mart Free Shipping â€” My Money Blog July 11, 2016 By Jonathan Ping Leave a Comment Last year, Amazon made up it’s own Black Friday-esque holiday and called it Amazon Prime Day.     It was mostly disappointing, but this year they have promised to do better and said that any marked deals will be at least a 20% discount from the previous 90-day average price.    Hopefully, it will be worth a look and you’ll be able to save money on things you’ve been looking to buy anyway. You must be an Amazon Prime member to get in on the deals, but free 30-day trial members also count.   If you are already a Prime member, you can also see their Early Access deals here . Here are some sample deals for Amazon Prime Day 2016, which starts July 12th at 3 AM Eastern (Midnight Pacific): Amazon Fire Tablet will be $33.33 (lowest price ever). Fire TV Streaming Stick will be $24.99 ($15 off the $39.99 regular price). Alexa users can get a $10 discount on their first Amazon order using Amazon Echo, Echo Dot, or Amazon Tap.  Talk to your cylinder to find out more. You can buy an Amazon Dash button for 99 cents and get $4.99 credit towards your first purchase.  These WiFi-connected buttons can be hacked to do other things. Free gift if you buy something $50+ from your Amazon baby registry. $10 off your first Amazon PrimeNOW order of $20 or more with coupon code 10PRIMENOW. I’ll try to update if anything interesting comes up.   Note that other merchants will be piggy-backing on the publicity bandwagon.   For example, Walmart.com is offering free shipping with no minimum  purchase size through 7/15. Notify me of follow-up comments by email.
