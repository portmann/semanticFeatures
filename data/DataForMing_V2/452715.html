The new setting works on the Echo, Echo Tap, and Echo Dot devices, allowing users to set their on-demand listening preference to Spotify (for Spotify premium subscribers), while Pandora can be Alexaâ€™s main music station service, The Verge reports. To change your default service, open up the Echo companion app or use the preferences site on your desktop browser. Then click â€œCustomize my music service preferences,â€? and tell Alexa that you want to listen your tunes on something other than Prime Music. If you don’t, every time you fail to specify which service you’d like to use, Alexa will try to pull up the track on Prime Music. Of course, if you don’t feel like commanding Alexa to play what you want (but isn’t that the point of a voice-controlled device?), you can also connect to your device via Bluetooth and manually select songs as well.
