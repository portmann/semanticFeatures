Facebook Sets A Strong Pace For 2015 - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Q1 2015 daily and monthly average users are up in line with current trends. User business pages and videos are driving advertisement revenue. Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) reported a successful first quarter this week. The social media giant answered strongly in the affirmative two of the biggest questions analysts want to know: "are the number of users increasing" and "is the company making more money from the user activity?" It's the basic unit price and volume equation that retailers and service providers use. And the numbers are big. Facebook maintained its upward trend in daily average users (DAU). From Q4 2014 to Q1 2015 DAU numbers rose 5.2%, and from Q1 2014 DAU growth was 16.7%. Those increases are in line with longer-period growth rates, and should satisfy both analysts and investors. Growth in users in the rest of the world category rose the most, followed by Asia-Pacific. US and Canada had the least percentage growth.

Again, these growth rates were about the same as earlier periods, so user numbers are still rising strongly and consistently. Mobile users also are gaining steadily as more people shift from PC to mobile platforms. In Q1 2015, mobile MAUs totaled 1.25 billion people, 66% higher than two years ago. However, MAUs who accessed Facebook only by mobile are now up to 581 million. Two years before they were only one-third of that. That shows the incredible growth Facebook can tap into with the potential monetization of its mobile apps like WhatsApp and Instagram. Source: Facebook, Q1 2015 Results presentation Facebook again delighted investors with 42% quarterly revenue growth. Reported quarterly EPS were $0.18, down from $0.25 in Q1 2014. Non-GAAP earnings were $0.42 per share versus $0.35 in the year-ago period for a 20% increase. Foreign currency exchange weighed on revenue. In the Q1 earnings call, the company said constant currency revenue would have been $190 million higher than the reported $3.54 billion quarterly revenue. This played a part in a small revenue miss compared to the $3.56 billion market estimate. Advertising revenue, which accounts for the overwhelming majority of total revenue, was up 46% to $3.32 billion. The weakness came from the company's payments side, which was down 5%. Had Facebook decided to begin monetizing WhatsApp and Instagram, which have 800 million and 300 million users, respectively, advertising revenue could have easily grown to meet and beat the market estimate. However, the company is holding back on starting that. Market detractors may be showing some anxiety just as investors did after Facebook listed when they didn't know how Facebook was going to make money from mobile. I would expect to see a similar surge in revenue when Facebook thinks it's time to make that move. Until then, user numbers for the platforms are still rising - a key factor for company growth - so this small miss shouldn't be a big issue for investors if they focus on ad revenue expansion. GAAP costs and expenses for Q1 were up 83% from Q1. The company explained in the earnings call that expenses related to the WhatsApp acquisition made up a significant part of the year-over-year expenses increase. In addition, head count-related costs rose from a big increase in staff hiring, which saw total numbers up 48% on last year to around 10,000. Facebook is gearing up for big growth in the short and mid term, with video, WhatsApp, further mobile advertising and Instagram, so the company needs to be ready for the heightened demand of computing power and application development. For example, Facebook is expanding its virtual reality development with Oculus , resulting in a big intake of new employees for that growing field. In the company's full-year 2015 guidance, CFO David Wehner said GAAP expenses are expected to settle down to a growth rate of 55%-65%, slightly tighter than the prior guidance of 55%-70%. Along with the revenue miss, the increase in expenses may be the reason why the stock has slipped since earnings came out, but I think that's short-sighted in light of the sheer amount of development that must be done over the next 3-5 years. If Facebook is to continue growing revenue in the high-double digits, it must invest sufficiently now. User business pages and videos driving ad revenue These impressive gains are being driven by the development of user business pages, e-commerce data analysis services and the huge increase in videos. Chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg said in the earnings call, "We believe video will play a significant role in bringing more marketers to mobile. More than 75% of global video views on Facebook occur on mobile - and we believe mobile video will become more important to marketers over time." CEO Mark Zuckerberg also noted that in Q1, over 4 billion videos were viewed daily for the first time. Video can drive more business because of the richer social interaction a buyer can have with a product as well as with the vendor. Now that there are 2 million advertisers on Facebook, the volume of sales and advertisements can continue to expand well.

The $84.63 share price is not a stretch if you look at annual EPS growth of an average 30% since 2012. Facebook can monetize its Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp apps to spur on further earnings growth, yet CEO Zuckerberg said in the earnings call, " What we're focused on doing is providing more higher quality services for free than what you could otherwise get in paying for them." The company's emphasis is growing user numbers, so if these services stay free for longer, it attracts new users and keeps them "sticky" to Facebook's services and ecosystem. All in all, Q1 was a good start to the year and I would expect to see the social media leader setting new ad and user records this year as well. Facebook shares are down about 3.5% since the earnings release. The stock story continues to improve with no major snags, so investors should look past the temporary expense rise and the small revenue miss. For longer-term buyers who can envision how much more the company can grow, I would say Facebook deserves an addition to your portfolio position.
