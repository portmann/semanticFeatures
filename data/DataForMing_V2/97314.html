Apple Bitcode, Processor Independence And Future Proofing The Apple Watch - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha An app technology Apple calls Bitcode has provoked speculation that it could facilitate a major shift in processor architectures for Apple's iOS devices. A shift, such as from ARM to Intel, is probably well beyond what Bitcode could support. However, Bitcode could support a shift to a 64 bit processor for Apple Watch. At WWDC Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) rolled out a feature for iOS and watchOS developers called Bitcode that has provoked some speculation about Apple's selection of future processor technologies. Some have interpreted this new feature as allowing Apple to change processor architectures for its mobile devices at will, such as adopting Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) for iOS devices. In fact, Apple's description of the new feature makes clear that such a radical change in processor architectures is not what Apple intends. Apple's near-term plans for Bitcode mostly involve accelerating the growth of the Apple Watch ecosystem. The concept of Bitcode was introduced by Apple VP of OS X Platform Andreas Wendker at the Platform State of the Union presentation that followed the WWDC keynote. Most of the general public has probably not seen this video since it targets app developers more narrowly. Bitcode was one of three technologies Wendker presented that make up what Apple calls App Thinning. App Thinning allows the Apple iOS App Store to reduce the size of an app that gets downloaded to a particular device. The popularity of apps, combined with the limited storage of some less expensive iOS devices, has made app thinning very important. App developers often develop so-called "universal" apps that work on both iPhone and iPad. These universal apps are necessarily bulkier because they contain components that may not be needed by a particular iOS device. App thinning allows the App store to download only the components that are needed, reducing the space requirements of the app. Bitcode was presented as part of the space optimization process of App Thinning. Bitcode is supposed to be an "intermediate" output of the compile process of converting a program written in a programming language such as Apple's Swift into the binary code that computer processors understand. This intermediate is supposed to be "recompiled" into binary by Apple's App Store. Apple has been more than a little vague about what this intermediate actually is, and what we know is mostly based on the functional description provided by Wendker. Bitcode would allow the App Store to "re-optimize your code for each kind of device," he said, and allow the use of "the latest compiler optimizations that we've been working on." He said it also "future proofs your app by allowing them to take advantage of new processor capabilities we might be adding in the future without you having to resubmit your app to the App Store." I interpreted Wendker's statements as indicating that the key focus is on app optimization, especially in terms of storage size. Apple is trying to help out developers who may not have the resources to test extensively on all iOS devices, who may not download the latest developer tools, or who just don't spend enough time optimizing their apps. But the media focused on the last statement about new processor capabilities. An article in thenextweb.com is fairly typical of the speculation regarding new processor technologies, and how Bitcode might facilitate changing processor platforms. An article by SA contributor William Tidwell went even further in speculating that Bitcode could facilitate a switch by Apple to Intel for its mobile devices. I seriously doubt that Apple would even contemplate using Bitcode as a transition mechanism in case it did decide to make such a radical change in processor architecture. The key reason has to do with the primary objection to Bitcode expressed by many developers. While Apple was offering to recompile apps using Bitcode, it wasn't offering to test them afterwards. The lack of testing scared developers who were afraid that the recompile from Bitcode would result in unforeseen bugs that would hurt developers in the eyes of their customers. I believe Bitcode turned out to be so unpopular that it was quickly pulled from the session on App Thinning at WWDC, as thenextweb.com and others pointed out. The concerns of developers might be overblown for minor changes to processor architecture or compilers but would be entirely justified for a radical jump in processor architecture, say from the current ARM architecture to Intel for iOS devices. In fact, I doubt that Bitcode could be used to make such a jump at all. This has to do with an ugly fact of iOS development that every developer and would be developer quickly learns. Getting an app to compile successfully into something that can be run on an iOS device is just the first, and easiest, step in the development process. The majority of the work is in fixing run-time bugs and crashes, things that only emerge during testing of the app. In the past, when I've discussed the ease with which developers could change target processors for their apps, I was referring to the first step of getting apps to compile. If Apple wanted to change architectures such as ARM, licensed by ARM Holdings (NASDAQ: ARMH ), to Intel or vice versa, the first step would be easy for developers. I glossed over the work required for the second step of fixing run-time bugs. That would take some effort. It's perfectly doable for the developers, but it's not what Apple is offering with Bitcode App Store compiling. A important clue to Apple's intentions for Bitcode lies in the fact that it is making it mandatory for Apple Watch apps. At this year's WWDC Apple rolled out watchOS 2, which will support "native" apps on the Watch. Until wOS2, app developers were not allowed to build native Watch apps, but only allowed to deploy iPhone apps that would download an interface component to Watch. Such apps were totally dependent on wireless tethering to iPhone and proved cumbersome in practice, since the component download could be very time consuming. Native apps don't require tethering to iPhone since all their logic and interface components reside exclusively on the Watch. Endowing developers with the ability to build native Watch apps puts them on par with Apple provided apps. Requiring Bitcode for watchOS apps indicates that Apple is still a little nervous about letting developers onto a platform that's so new. Bitcode will allow Apple to recompile developer apps in case Apple makes any of the following platform changes: changes to the compiler itself, changes to watchOS, and changes to the Watch processor. I believe Apple was primarily motivated to pursue Bitcode by Apple Watch. Apple understands the importance of an app ecosystem to the success of a new product such as Watch. Although Apple touted that there were "thousands" of apps available for Watch, that's actually not very many, and many of these were the previously hobbled developer apps. Apple realized that it couldn't afford to wait a year or more to allow developers fully onto the Watch platform, as it did with the first iPhone. But it also knew that the Watch is evolving rapidly. With the arrival of new Apple systems on chip (SOCs) based on the most advanced Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) and/or TSMC processes, Apple has the ability to deploy a much more capable processor to the Watch, and will probably do so early next year. Apple is understandably reticent about processor plans for the Watch, but I think it's apparent that the current version is rather underpowered for the ambitious suite of capabilities that Apple has set forth for the Watch. Apple's 64 bit processors have been so successful in enhancing iPhone and iPad device capabilities while reducing battery drain that I believe Apple will be motivated to adopt the same technology for Watch. An Apple Watch powered by a 64 bit processor would use the ARM v8 64 bit instruction set, as do all Apple iOS devices that use the Apple A7 and A8/A8x SOCs. Using the new Samsung 14 nm process to build Apple's next generation SOCs should also shrink the die size of the processor of the Watch sufficiently to facilitate 64 bit capability. ARM 64 bit processors using the ARM v8 instruction set maintain excellent backward compatibility with previous ARM v7 apps, so I believe that using Bitcode to facilitate the transition to a 64 bit processor in Watch is doable. This is the largest jump that I think Bitcode can reasonably support. A 64 bit processor on the Watch would give it a significant advantage in the smart watch marketplace and short circuit Intel's aspirations in the wearables category. Apple's first 64 bit SOC, the A7, had a dramatic impact on the smartphone market, helping to propel iPhone sales for the 5s and 6/6Plus. A 64 bit SOC that can be worn on the wrist will do the same for Apple Watch. Source: Apple Bitcode, Processor Independence And Future Proofing The Apple Watch Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL.
