A Simple Look At Ford's Debt And Cash - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford has a balance sheet that can confound both new and experienced investors. The nature of the business is fairly complex and makes it difficult to accurately asses the capital structure which leads to rampant misinformation concerning the cash and especially the debt. If you follow Ford (NYSE: F ) here on Seeking Alpha you have likely stumbled upon the many articles that "misdiagnose" Ford's debt and sometimes cash. I've done it before in my first article on Ford and I'm still ashamed of myself for that. I should probably just delete that disaster but it is useful as a reminder of what not to do. I won't call out any other articles that aren't my own, but about once a week a new one pops up that completely misses the boat on Ford's debt. I'm not advocating that anybody purchase shares in Ford but understanding the balance sheet may help with that personal decision. The first problem with Ford's balance sheet that many run into is likely the source of information. I usually have two Safari windows open when I'm looking into a company, one with six or seven tabs and another dedicated to just SEC EDGAR tabs. One of the tabs is always Morningstar . Morningstar is a great free (and premium) resource for investing research and provides a ton of information in an easily digestible format. Unfortunately it can also display inaccurate or misleading information as it does with Ford's balance sheet. The screenshot above is what Morningstar displays for Ford's consolidated balance sheet. Starting at the top it shows Ford had $67 billion in cash and equivalents at the end of the last quarter. We go down a little further and see short term debt reported as $13.2 billion and long-term debt at a staggering $127 billion for $140.2 billion total. Most investors at this point would swear Ford off altogether. Unfortunately what we have here is both misreported and misunderstood figures. If we pull up Ford's most recent 10-Q from the SEC we start to see things with a little more clarity. The first problem we can see is what Morningstar reports as cash. Ford itself reported just $39.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Even if we try to stretch what can be considered cash, getting to $67 billion is a challenge. Ford also does a much better job at attempting to differentiate it's debt. They split it up as "Automotive debt" and "Financial Services debt" which coincidentally matches what Morningstar reports as short-term and long-term debt respectively. Even though they split it up it could still be confusing, debt is debt after all, and investors may not be aware of Ford Credit and what it does for the company. The "Automotive debt" is what Ford Motor Company holds on the balance sheet for the automotive segment of their business. They could have taken on that debt for retooling at the factories, research and development, marketing, recall costs, or just buying printer paper and ink. It is the debt that many other businesses may possess. The "Financial Services debt" is what gets most people twisted up. This debt is the vehicles that Ford sold or leased through Ford Credit to both retail customers and dealerships and other distributors. Through Ford Credit the company carries secured debt like a home mortgage would be for Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC ), for this reason it is best to view Ford Credit like a bank. So long as people pay off their car note our beloved Ford makes out pretty well on this debt. If they do not pay their note then Ford can always repossess the car and resell to recoup some of those losses. This last quarter Ford Credit contributed $516 million in pre-tax profit. Of course this type of debt opens them up to delinquencies and loss-to-receivables. Ford addresses this risk by maintaining a war-chest separate from Ford Motor in the amount of $463 million this last quarter to cover losses. Ford Credit is also self-funding and self-liquidating in nature, combine that with the high-quality credit they lend to and the risk is much less than first assumed. I've grown quite fond of this segment of their business and have written on it a little bit . It is worth noting that not all financial services debt is secured. That being the case the company will have paid back $13.6 billion of that unsecured debt within a year leaving $52.7 billion in unsecured long-term debt to deal with. Knowing what we know now about that scary debt figure we can see that Ford actually has a pretty great balance sheet. Total assets come in at $240.7 billion and total liabilities at $210.9 billion for net assets of $29.8 billion. Now lets circle back to the cash, which Ford also breaks down for us in detail and even splits up into the Automotive and Financial sectors. The only thing I'm curious about is where their non-US government cash is being placed since yields in other industrialized countries are near zero or even negative meaning Ford could be losing cash here. It will be interesting to watch these figures quarter to quarter and see if the company begins shifting more cash to non-government securities to get a better return. To summarize, the cash/debt situation is not so dire at Ford as some assume. The basic numbers are not as bad as many believe: The company goes to great lengths to ensure their debt and cash is better understood. Unfortunately a quick glimpse at sources like Morningstar can greatly mislead investors of all skill levels and it is important to get as close to the source as possible. The old adage "trust but verify" cannot be overstated here. I hope you all got something out of this article. I do appreciate the time you took reading it.
