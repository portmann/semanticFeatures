Report: Verizon data center auction draws P-E interest in second round - The Carlyle Group (NASDAQ:CG) | Seeking Alpha Jul  8 2016, 13:46 ET | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor An auction of Verizon's ( VZ +0.9%) data centers has moved to a second round , CTFN reports. The carrier had launched a sales effort at the beginning of the year with hopes to drawing $2.5B or more. Now rumored suitors include Providence Equity, Carlyle Group (NASDAQ: CG ) and Blackstone Group (NYSE: BX ) among those who might pay $2.5B-$3B, a price that weeds out a lot of strategic buyers. The move to sell data centers -- news that was shot down in the fall by CFO Fran Shammo -- would be a reversal of its actions five years ago, when it paid $1.4B for Terremark in a move into hosting and co-location.
