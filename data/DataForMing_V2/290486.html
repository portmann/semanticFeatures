Capitalizing On Netflix's Volatility - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I am/we are long NFLX. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. Netflix is a very controversial high-flying growth stock with a nosebleed valuation as measured by its price-to-earnings multiple. Itâ€™s difficult to arrive at an accurate valuation based on traditional metrics for this media disruptor. Netflix is a highly volatile stock and swings of $10 per share throughout the course of a day are all too often observed. Utilizing biweekly contacts one can expect to obtain a cash premium of roughly 3.5%. Netflix will have to grow into its valuation. In the meantime, as a long investor, writing covered calls in opportunistic scenarios mitigates these drastic swings in the stock. Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) is a very controversial high-flying growth stock with a nosebleed valuation as measured by its price-to-earnings multiple. Due to its rapid growth, expanding original programming, wrestling market share away from big cable companies, expansion into international markets and its overall ubiquity, it's easy to see why investors are willing to pay a premium. It's difficult to arrive at an accurate valuation based on traditional metrics for this media disruptor. Due to these factors and the difficulty of placing an accurate valuation on Netflix, options in the form of covered call writing may be an effective way to leverage this high-flier while mitigating downside risk. Netflix offers a confluence of volatility, liquidity and a high level of interest which gives rise to high yielding premiums on a bi-weekly or monthly basis. This confluence bodes well for those who are long Netflix and desire to leverage options trading to augment returns and mitigate risk throughout the volatile nature of Netflix. Netflix is a highly volatile stock and swings of $10 per share (or ~8%) throughout the course of a day are all too often observed. These swings to the upside or downside can be difficult to stomach. However one can leverage his position via writing covered call contracts to mitigate these swings while remaining long this volatile stock. Utilizing biweekly contacts one can expect to obtain a cash premium of roughly 3.5% with a strike price that's within 3% of one's original purchase price (tables 1 and 2). Table 2 - Realized profits expressed net of fees Taken together, leveraging covered calls against my Netflix position generated a realized income per share of $13.33 in cash. This equates to a realized 10.7% yield ($13.33/$124.42) over the course of two months. Opportunistic spikes in Netflix stocks bodes well for options: Figure 2 - Google Finance graph displaying a drop of $10 per share move in Netflix on January 13th, 2016. Writing a covered call into strength as was the case on Jan. 6th, 2016, provides an opportunity for a higher strike price to decrease the chances or relinquishing shares of the underlying security. This provides current income while still maintaining a long position in the stock. Leveraging the stock during times of upswings bodes well for covered call writing. Netflix provides plenty of these scenarios to take advantage of on a monthly basis. Granted, Netflix is a contentiously debated stock. However the company has disrupted the entire traditional media landscape and has become ubiquitous throughout the US. Recently they announced that they've penetrated over 130 countries and that their worldwide expansion is well underway. Households are moving away from traditional cable and moving toward streaming services such as Netflix for a fraction of the cost. This bodes well for Netflix, especially as more original content is delivered along with more added value partnerships such as Disney. The nosebleed valuation is of concern. However the growth and the fact that this company has penetrated millions of homes domestically and abroad gives way to an ongoing future for this company. Netflix will have to grow into its valuation. In the meantime, as a long investor, writing covered calls in opportunistic scenarios may mitigate these drastic swings in the stock price while generating income.
