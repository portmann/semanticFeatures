Disney: What Does The Future Hold? - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha In a previous article, I detailed Disney’s growth story over the past decade. While revenue growth was average, the company’s increased margins, share repurchases and multiple expansion led to an exceptional investment. In a previous article , I detailed the "fairy tale" growth story of Disney (NYSE: DIS ). It wasn't a made up story, it actually occurred, but it was indeed a compelling tale. Over the past decade, Disney has provided 18% annual total investment returns. Every dollar that you had invested back in 2005 would now be worth over $5 today. Depending on the magnitude of your partnership, this is the sort of thing that leads to life changing investment results. Perhaps just as impressive is how the company achieved this remarkable growth. From a cursory glance, it can be hard to unscramble where the growth was derived. Certainly, a stock chart wouldn't help out in that endeavor - all it tells you is what happened to the price, not the underlying business. Once you begin to parse out the details, in my opinion, the story becomes that much more interesting. Surely you could look at the company in more granular detail, but I would contend that four basic areas worked together to provide the investment's performance results. Let's review each to get an understanding of Disney's past growth along with the potential repeatability moving forward. From fiscal 2005 through 2014, Disney was able to grow revenues from $32 billion to $49 billion - or a compound growth rate of 4.8% per annum. This is reasonable, but certainly overly impressive. As a comparison, Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO ) was able to grow sales by 8% per year during this time period, while Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) - despite selling 10 times the amount of stuff - was able to grow revenues by 4.9% per year. In other words, the exceptional investment returns of Disney during the past decade were not fueled by massive increases in the top line. On the other hand, Disney's earnings growth was indeed impressive. Total company profits went from $2.7 billion to $7.5 billion over the same time period, for an annual growth rate of nearly 12%. This was achieved by a much improved net profit margin moving from 8.5% to 15.4%. The sales were moving at an OK pace, but the quality of those sales was improving dramatically. During this stretch, Disney was also able to reduce common shares outstanding. The total outstanding shares went from about 2 billion to 1.7 billion. As a result, earnings per share went from $1.30 to $4.30 - a growth rate of about 14% per year. Fourteen percent annual EPS growth is impressive by itself. However, Disney shareholders also enjoyed a final growth factor - an expanding P/E ratio. The earnings multiple went from about 18 to roughly 25 over this time period. As a result, Disney partners saw investment returns on the magnitude of 18% per year. Due to the confluence of these factors, investors saw exceptional investment returns. All four factors worked in concert to provide an exceptional result. Of course, it's nice to know the history, but the true question is whether or not these factors come into play moving forward. Just as they are helpful in understanding the company's past, these same factors can also provide some insight into a prospective investment today. Let's think about the same factors on a 10-year forward-looking basis. Over the past 10-years, Disney grew revenues by roughly 4.8% per year. In the coming years, analysts are again expecting mid-single digit revenue growth (around 6%). Perhaps the company grows sales faster than it had in the past. Then again, perchance the size of the business begins to catch up with Disney. For the sake of prudence, let's imagine that the company can grow revenues by 4.5% per annum over the next 10 years. Growing revenues by 4.5% per year would indicate that Disney might have total sales of about $76 billion in the next decade. Disney's past earnings growth greatly outpaced revenue growth due to margin expansion. While this possibility still exists, it necessarily becomes much more difficult to continue expanding your margins through time. Eventually, you reach a point where further price increases and/or cost reductions present a negative or at least mitigating headwind. In 2005, Disney had a net profit margin of 8.5%. In 2014, the number was 15.4%. Analysts are expecting this number to continue climbing to just over 19%. For the sake of prudence, let's imagine it does continue to increase, albeit just moderately. Perhaps Disney has a net profit margin of say 17% in a decade - splitting the difference between the current mark and what's expected. If Disney sells $76 billion worth of stuff, this indicates that it would generate profits of nearly $13 billion - roughly 70% higher than the company's current mark and representing 5.7% annual growth. Total company profits and earnings per share can grow at the same rate, presuming the share count remains constant. However, this usually isn't the case. Instead, companies regularly issue or preferably repurchase shares. Over the past 10 years, the company has reduced common shares outstanding by 1.6% per year. Currently, the company has the authorization to repurchase an additional 396 million shares . Given the relatively low dividend payout ratio, it follows that Disney has both the propensity and ability to continue reducing share count. Perhaps this amounts to 1% less shares annually. At the end of 10 years, this would equate to about 1.5 billion common shares outstanding. In turn, with profits of roughly $13 billion, this would indicate earnings per share of approximately $8.70. Expressed differently, 4.5% revenue growth could translate to 7.3% EPS growth due to margin improvement and a reduced share count. The final growth aspect is how share prices react. Obviously, this is unknown, but once more, it can be instructive to remain prudent in one's assumptions. In this case, the P/E expansion category could actually indicate a lack thereof. Perhaps Disney trades at say 18 times earnings in the future - reasonable and in line with the company's history. With $8.70 in earnings, this would imply a future share price of approximately of about $157. Once again, it should be underscored that this depends on a huge variety of assumptions (including those beyond the four aspects listed here). It's important to keep in mind that this is merely a way to get a feel for a potential investment and should likely be accompanied by varying scenarios. A future share price of $157 would represent annual growth of about 3% per year. In this case, revenue growth, profits and EPS growth worked together, but the valuation would drag against all three. The average annual growth rate would be roughly 3% per year - a far cry from the 18% growth over the past 10 years, which in turn nicely illustrates the importance of each factor. Effectively, the same amount of revenue growth can mean two completely different ending stories. Of course, you would also have to add in the dividends received along the way. Given the relatively low payout ratio and the company's past increases, perhaps this mark grows faster than earnings per share, say by 11% per year. In this case, you would end up with a future dividend of about $3.40, representing a payout ratio of nearly 40%. In addition, you would expect to collect perhaps $22 in payments over the years, bringing the total anticipated value of Disney to nearly $180. Once you add in the dividends received, your total annual expected returns would be closer to 4.5% - still not extraordinary. In order for Disney to provide better results, you would need faster growth (in any or all of the areas) or a higher valuation multiple. In short, Disney was an exceptional investment over the past 10 years. The revenue growth was just average, but three other factors - margin improvement, share repurchases and P/E expansion - came together to provide excellent returns. This is instructive in two ways: it allows you to understand the history of the company as an investment, and it provides you with a baseline moving forward. If you asked yourself what the future holds for Disney today, you might work through a similar analysis. On the revenue side, perhaps you would presume more or less of the same: mid-single digit growth. With regard to total profits, this might grow faster than revenues, but perhaps not as robustly as it had in the past. You can only increase margins so much and Disney has effectively doubled its profitability already over the last decade. Share repurchases can add a percent or two of growth, and seem likely to continue. Finally, the earnings multiple holds an important key to either adding an extended boost or drag on one's investment results. Unless Disney trades at an even higher valuation or provides unexpected (higher) growth moving forward, it appears that investment returns of the next decade will likely trail that of the past one.
