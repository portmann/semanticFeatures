Even The Best Apple Analysts Are Far From Perfect - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has predicted that major changes will arrive in the 2017 iPhone, while the next generation iPhone 7 will be little changed. Kuo's predictions have helped fuel pessimism about Apple. A survey of Kuo's longer range predictions shows that they are often inaccurate. The bearish view that Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) next iPhone (7) will lack innovation has found support in the predictions of highly regarded analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. However, a survey of Kuo's predictions over the past couple of years reveals he is far from perfect, even if he is the best of the Apple analysts. Moreover, his longer term predictions, such as for the 2017 iPhone (8), tend to be the least accurate. A recent article by SA contributor Paulo Santos projected that the 2017 iPhone would be the iPhone that Steve Jobs would have wanted. Since the article relied substantially on the predictions of KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, I decided to take a hard look at the accuracy of Kuo's predictions since the beginning of 2014. Kuo enjoys a high reputation among analysts and is often referred to as an "insider", whatever that means. It is thought that he has widespread contacts in Apple's supply chain, and it has even been rumored, within Apple itself. Kuo predictions regarding a 2017 iPhone were published in a note to investors on March 26. Apple Insider was provided a copy of the note, as it has been consistently over the past few years. According to the note, the 2017 iPhone would revert to the "glass sandwich" design of the iPhone 4/4s, but use curved glass front and back similar to the Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) Galaxy S7 Edge, which is also a glass sandwich. It would also have other features of the Edge, including a large 5.8 inch screen (the Edge has a 5.5 inch screen), a curved AMOLED display, and wireless charging. It is perhaps not coincidence that the S7 series was released on March 11. A month later, Kuo issued another note concerning iPhone 7. He stated that it would not have "many attractive selling points", and reiterated his pessimistic projection of below 200 million iPhone sales for 2016. He indicated that iPhone "needs a makeover", which he reiterated is coming with the 2017 model. Kuo has made a number of predictions regarding the iPhone 7. The first was on September 6, 2015, in which he predicted that it would be the thinnest iPhone ever, at 6.0-6.5 millimeters. This prompted one of the earliest and most attractive of the iPhone 7 concepts shown at the top of the article. This concept has more or less been dropped by most sites as they have embraced the "little or no change" rumors about iP7. In fact, the reduction in thickness, however executed, would be a significant design change, as I've pointed out . In subsequent research notes, Kuo has predicted that iP7 would feature 3 GB of RAM for the Plus model, as well as his prediction on April 4 of iPhone shipments in calendar 2016 below 200 million units due to soft iPhone SE demand and slow sales of iPhone 6s. As of this date, none of Kuo's predictions regarding iPhone 7 can be verified. Lacking the ability to assess the current crop of iP7 and iP8 predictions from Kuo, I decided to do the next best thing, which is look systematically at his predictions over the past couple of years. In this I was aided by the fact that Apple Insider has assiduously published capsule summaries of his research notes. A search of Ming-Chi Kuo on the Apple Insider site showed what I assume to be a complete list of his notes going back several years. Starting April 9, 2014, I tabulated all the reported predictions, and graded them for accuracy on a scale of 0-4, whenever the prediction outcomes were known. It was a tedious process, since there were more than 40 predictions up to the present. In some cases, Kuo's research notes merely reiterated previous predictions, and these were usually omitted from the grading process. I've included a summary table of the predictions, with links to the Apple Insider articles, appended to the end of the article, since the table is so long. Kuo's research notes often contain numerous predictions on a broad range of topics. Often, Apple Insider broke these up into a number of separate articles all published on the same day. Rather than try to enumerate each separate prediction, I've gone with Apple Insider's grouping of them by article, and assigned a grade on an article-by-article basis. Even within an article, there would typically be 3 or 4 separate predictions. In my grading, I gave partial credit where some of the predictions were correct. The overall average I arrived at was 2.63, which would amount to a B- letter grade. Not particularly good in absolute terms, but probably better than anyone else. Certainly, better than what I would score, I will concede. There have been some significant prediction flops (grade of 0). For instance, on April 9 Kuo predicted that a low cost iMac would be released in Q2. There was no such iMac, and in fact, the only new iMac introduction was the higher end 27" 5K iMac released in October 2014. Similarly, on March 2015, Kuo predicted that Watch would ship with three new case materials by the Fall, in addition to the aluminum, stainless steel, and gold already shown. There were no such new case materials. Often, Kuo's predictions are most accurate for events only a few days in the future. For instance, on September 4, 2014, Kuo predicted that the iWatch would be unveiled at the September iPhone launch event and launch in early 2015. This turned out to be correct. On October 14 Kuo predicted that the iPad Air 2 and a Retina display iMac would launch at the October 16 Special Event. They did. Up until his predictions about iPhone 8, Kuo had not tried to make predictions of Apple products more than a generation removed from the current products. This should give investors pause, given that his accuracy necessarily declines as the time delay increases. My personal take on the iPhone 8 prediction is that it was very influenced by the release of the Samsung Galaxy S7 a couple of weeks before. Kuo concluded that the S7 represented the direction that Apple needed to go. My point in grading Kuo is not to diminish his accomplishments. He is still the best of Apple analysts. My point is to show the difficulty of making accurate predictions in light of Apple's secrecy and the overall lack of reliable information regarding future products. In addition to the prediction difficulties, assertions of what Steve Jobs would do in the current circumstances are highly suspect. Jobs was rather mercurial and more than capable of overturning past decisions. Even though Jobs died in October 2011, a year before the release of iPhone 5, he probably had reviewed early design concepts for it and endorsed that change in design direction. I frankly doubt that Apple is ever going back to the glass sandwich, given all the complaints about its fragility. The supposed changes in iPhone 8 have been used by Apple critics to substantiate the claim that iPhone 7 lacks innovation. It's an interesting strategy, given that predictions about a 2017 iPhone are necessarily weak. My interpretation has been that Apple is more likely moving away from the two year "tick-tock" design cycle to a one year cycle. I don't claim to have certain knowledge of Apple product plans but have simply observed that the claims about iPhone 7 run contrary to Apple's continuing innovation in processors and operating systems. That processor innovation drives the ability to innovate in other areas such as screen size, and the thinness of the device. The one Kuo prediction about iPhone 7 that I believe is accurate is that the device will be about a millimeter thinner. Rather than rushing to judgment that "everybody hates iPhone 7", I'm taking a wait and see attitude. I recommend investors do the same. I remain long Apple and rate it a buy for investors with a 3-5 year investment horizon. iWatch to be released in 2 sizes in 2014 Q3 with flexible AMOLED display to support curved displays, sapphire cover, biometric recognition, SiP, Apple Watch released April 2015, 2 sizes no biometric recognition, SiP, non-flexible AMOLED flat display, sapphire cover on higher priced models iPad Air update to be released in 2014 Q3, featuring A8 processor, 8MP rear camera New 12 inch MacBook Air to be released in 2014 Q3 New low cost iMac to be released in Q2 12.9 inch iPad unlikely until 2015, will feature new user interface New Apple TV to be released with motion sensing user interface and probably an App Store by Fall 2014 Late production start of Nov 2014 for iWatch with limited availability at end of year. 3 million to ship by year's end. 5.5 inch iPhone 6 model likely delayed into 2015 due to production problems with large screen Doesn't expect redesigned Lightning cable or power adapter for iPhone IPhone 128 GB versions, barometer, programmable power button, no sapphire iWatch to launch in 2015, to be unveiled at Sept 2014 event iPad Air 2 and Retina display iMac to launch at Oct 16 event Predicts 71.4 million iPhone shipments in calendar 2014 Q4 and 49.3 in calendar 2015 Q1 Predicts Macs powered by A series SOC by 2016, A series will reach level between Intel Atom and Core i3, next gen A9 fab split between Samsung and TSMC No Macs powered by A series SOCs, performance of A9 at about the Core M level, A9 fab was split 73 iPhones shipped in calendar 2014 Q4, Watch debut in March, 12" MacBook in Q1 iPad shipments in calendar 2015 Q1 to be 10.1 million units, 7-8 million in calendar Q2 Apple watch to include 3 new case materials by the Fall.
