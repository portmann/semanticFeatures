(AAPL) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor Re/code, which was the first to report Apple ( AAPL +0.8%) plans to launch a Web TV service, now reports Apple wants to include "widespread access" to local U.S. TV channels, a feature not provided by Dish and Sony's offerings. Apple's efforts are said to have "complicated its negotiations with the broadcast TV networks, because most broadcasters don’t own all their local stations." Some execs also state broadcasters will have to invest in streaming infrastructure to support local feeds. As a result, the service might not launch in early fall, the target date Apple has given programmers. However, TV execs think it will eventually launch, and that money (rather than technical issues) is the main hurdle. The WSJ reported earlier this week Apple hopes to unveil the service at WWDC next month ahead of a fall launch. Separately, research firm Slice estimates (based on an analysis of online sales receipts) U.S. Apple Watch orders have generally been below 30K/day (implies a quarterly run rate of ~2.7M) following big early sales. Altogether, Slice thinks Apple sold nearly 2.5M Watches in the U.S. from April 10 (the day pre-orders started) through May 18. KGI's Ming-Chi Kuo recently cut his 2015 Apple Watch shipment forecast to 15M (others have forecast 20M-30M), citing a lack of major changes to shipment times in spite of supply constraints. Kuo also estimated ~80% of Watch orders are for the larger 42mm models. Interesting.... Or is this talk, speculation? It would be cool. I miss when steve would surprise people (secret project) out of no where of a new apple product.
