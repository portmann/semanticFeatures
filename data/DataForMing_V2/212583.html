Comcast Could Be The Next Company To Offer Cell Service â€“ Consumerist Whoops! It looks like portions of our site are being blocked! Check your browser settings or contact your network administrator. Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter, reports that Comcast is inching closer to introducing its own wireless service by reselling Verizon’s wireless service that it acquired back in 2012. As part of that deal, in which Comcast and other cable companies sold spectrum licenses to Verizon for $3.6 billion, the cable company secured the rights to resell Verizon’s wireless services. If Comcast’s plans move forward, the company would offer a hybrid cellular and WiFi service using Verizon’s network and hotspots, Bloomberg reports. Verizon CFO Fran Shammo confirmed that the company had been informed by unnamed cable companies of the plans. â€œObviously, the industry is moving,â€? Shammo said. â€œCable is going to do what theyâ€™re going to do, and weâ€™re going to do what weâ€™re going to do.â€? A spokesperson for Comcast declined to provide comment on the issue. Analysts tell Bloomberg that if Comcast has indeed notified Verizon of its intention to resell wireless services, it could start as soon as six months from now. Because the network has already been built, Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst with New Street Research LLC, says the consumer cost for the service could start at $25 to $30 per month.
