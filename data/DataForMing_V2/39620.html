ETF Hub Apr 25 2015, 14:47 ET | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor "We already own enough of it, thank you very much," says SoftBank ( OTCPK:SFTBF ) Internet/media chief Nikesh Arora about Yahoo Japan ( OTCPK:YAHOY ). Yahoo's (NASDAQ: YHOO ) recently-disclosed efforts to explore options for its 35.5% YJ stake had fueled speculation SoftBank (owns 43% of YJ) would try to buy the stake. At the same time, Arora, formerly Google's sales chief, states SoftBank (has a portfolio of 1,300+ investments) is up for making new investments in growth companies ... at the right price. With valuations for private U.S. tech companies having soared , India, which has relatively low Web, smartphone, and e-commerce penetration rates and a new government widely seen as more business-friendly than its predecessor, has been an area of interest. SoftBank led a $627M funding round in Indian e-commerce marketplace Snapdeal last year, and has been rumored to be weighing a major investment in low-end Indian Android OEM Micromax. It has also led a $600M round for Chinese ride-sharing platform Kuaidi Dache ( recently merged with top rival Didi Dache), and invested $250M in top Southeast Asian ride-sharing platform GrabTaxi. The Japanese conglomerate's 797.7M-share Alibaba stake (current pre-tax value of $67.5B) leaves it with plenty of fresh powder for further dealmaking.
