Intel: Post-Earnings Rally? - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel’s second quarter revenue could surprise the Street. If the client computing group delivers revenue close to $8 billion, which isn’t impossible, Intel’s overall revenue could exceed $14 billion. In that case, shares of the company should rally post earnings and gradually advance toward $40. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) will release its second quarter 2016 earnings on July 20 after market close. The analyst community is estimating that on average Intel's EPS will be $0.53 on revenue of $13.54 billion. In the first quarter Intel's EPS came in at $0.54, beating analysts' estimates significantly, on revenue of $13.8 billion. The company's client computing group revenue showed a sign of stabilization driven by better than expected PC and mobile processor sales in the first quarter. For the second quarter, I expect that if Intel's revenue exceeds $14 billion, its shares will march toward $40. Although a few experts believe that stronger PC demand will bode well for Intel's client computing group ("CCG"), I don't believe there's enough reason to be too optimistic. However, due to the ongoing PC gaming bandwagon, I prefer to be fairly optimistic. IDC forecasted that PC sales will continue to decline in the current year. IDC projected 7.3% YoY decline in worldwide PC shipments this year primarily driven by depressed commodity prices and weak international currencies vis-à-vis USD. The only silver lining in the cloud is the PC gaming market. According to a report by Jon Peddie Research (JPR) which tracks the gaming market, PC gaming hardware market will resume growth in 2016. The report said: The global PC gaming hardware market is forecast to slightly recede in 2015 but, but less than the overall PC market, and then resume growth in 2016. The boutique builders agree with JPR's findings. Jon Back, founder of Puget Systems, a boutique builder, said : At Puget Systems, our high end gaming PC sales have never been better. Windows 10, Skylake, 4K, VR, and a strong year of gaming title launches, has made 2015 a strong year for enthusiast gaming PCs, and we expect 2016 to be even stronger. For Intel, the rising demand for gaming PCs is good news amid all the doom and gloom related to the eroding traditional PC client business. The chipmaker launched its Broadwell-E processor lineup at Computex 2016 in Taipei in the second quarter targeted at high-end desktops used in PC gaming including VR. The Broadwell-E lineup will help Intel offset revenue loss from general-purpose PCs chips to an extent. In a previous article I shared my view regarding Intel's Broadwell-E lineup. As far as mobile chip sales are concerned, Intel is well-positioned with winning modem chip orders from Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) for the latter's upcoming iPhone 7 due for release in this fall. As a result, abandoning low-end Atom line of processors for mobile won't adversely affect Intel's overall mobile revenue. Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri believes that Intel could supply more than half of iPhone 7 modems, and possibly displace Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) entirely from the Apple supply chain. With iPhone 7 hitting the markets globally in September, it's entirely possible that Intel has already started to supply modems to Apple, and the CCG revenue in the second quarter should reflect this to an extent. In the first quarter, Intel's CCG revenue came in at $7.5 billion, down 14% sequentially and up 2% YoY. YoY growth in the first quarter, however small, indicated that the secular decline in Intel's CCG revenue was arrested. I expect that in the second quarter the chipmaker's CCG revenue will remain flat to slightly positive sequentially. The CCG revenue should be in the range of $7.5 to $8 billion primarily driven by PC gaming and modem supply to Apple. After fifteen months of launching the Broadwell architecture, Intel brought Broadwell in the server market with the launch of multi-socket Broadwell-EP at the end of first quarter. In Intel's first quarter earnings preview I wrote : The economics of the datacenter hardware industry is gradually shifting toward demand-driven price increase. With enterprises and governments across the world continuing to outsource data hosting and processing to third-party providers, available space for building cloud datacenters is becoming scarce and as a result price of cloud-based services is gradually rising. This phenomenon, in turn, is supporting higher prices for server processors. In the first quarter, Intel's datacenter group ("DCG") revenue came in at $4 billion. The second quarter should see a sequential increase in DCG revenue of approximately 10-12% to $4.5 billion driven by increasing adoption of Xeon E5-2600 v4 processor family based on Broadwell-EP. Since the Xeon E5 v4 series has more server-oriented features as well as features for virtualized servers, new cloud datacenter buildouts across the world will certainly adopt it to support their hyperscale cloud deployments. Further, Intel's strategy to keep hyperscale datacenter operators engaged with it via acquiring Altera will also start to bear fruit and reflect in its DCG revenue. Revenue from Intel's programmable solutions group (which includes Altera business) should be in the range of $400 million to $450 million. With the telecom and wireless industry continuing to grow satisfactorily in 2016, primarily driven by explosion of mobile devices and broadband connectivity, demand for Altera's FPGAs will remain strong. Further, Intel has already started pairing Altera's Arria 10 FPGAs with its Xeon E5-2600 v4 processors. However, I have factored in this development in Intel's DCG revenue. As far as Intel's security business is concerned, I expect that revenue should be impressive due to decent enterprise demand. Although Intel is planning to sell off its security business in order to narrow its focus on IoT (Internet of Things) and cloud computing business, I don't expect them to sell off the entire security unit. This is because the company would find it difficult to survive without providing chip-level security in the future. Intel Security's Bruce Snell said in an interview earlier this year: Part of our job at Intel Security is to make sure that we're working with the carriers and the manufacturers to really start thinking about security and really take it very seriously. In future Intel will embed its security solutions in hardware at an increasing rate and put less emphasis on selling security software. In that case it may sell off its software-based security business. I expect that Intel's security revenue will be around $550 million in the second quarter. Intel's non-volatile memory solutions group revenue could be a bit softer in the second quarter because businesses are likely to postpone buying Intel's SSDs until the company releases its much-awaited 3D XPoint-based Optane line of SSDs. Revenue is expected to be below $500 million. Finally, I expect that Chipzilla's IoT group revenue should see robust growth. The basis of my expectation is Gartner's prediction , according to which 6.4 billion things, i.e., devices will be connected to the Internet by the end of this year. In the first quarter, Intel's IoT group revenue came in at $651 million, up 22% YoY. Revenue from this group should cross $700 million in the second quarter. Intel's revenue from the groups under the "other groups" category should amount to around $2.2 billion. Whether Intel's second quarter revenue crosses $14 billion or not will depend on its CCG revenue. If CCG delivers close to $8 billion in revenue, total revenue could easily cross $14 billion, beating analysts' estimates by a wide margin. If that really happens, I expect its share price to touch $40. Disclosure: I am/we are long INTC, QCOM. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
