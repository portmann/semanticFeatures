Netflix's $6 Billion Hit - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Shares of Netflix took a beating after management reported that sales more or less matched expectations but that earnings easily surpassed forecasts. The pessimism has come from a low subscriber add count, which is causing investors to fear that its growth prospects may not be that great moving forward. I believe that, all in all, this is true of its domestic operations but its international operations still have a great deal of potential. This is part of Netflix's transition away from growth but as its international segment outpaces its domestic business, investors should be prepared for volatility. Shares of Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) fell as much as 15.5% after the market closed on July 18th in response to news that its subscriber count fell far short of management's own forecasts earlier this year. As a result of this, the firm's market capitalization plummeted as much as $6.56 billion, bringing the firm's total market value down from $42.32 billion to $35.76 billion. In what follows, I want to give my own thoughts on what happened and what this means for investors and the business as a whole moving forward. The quarterly performance for Netflix actually wasn't that bad. Management reported sales during the quarter of about $2.11 billion (rounding up), which matched analysts' expectations and was up from the prior year's quarter of $1.64 billion. Meanwhile, the company's bottom line blew forecasts out of the water. While analysts had been forecasting earnings for the quarter of $0.02 per share, down from the prior year's second quarter when earnings totaled $0.06 per share, the firm's bottom line actually came out to $0.09. Even after adjusting for interest and other income, which was up materially from last year, and accounting for taxes accordingly, the business still generate per-share income of $0.06. Based solely on this, you would think that shares of the enterprise should be soaring, not falling like a rock. However, for many investors who find Netflix appealing, the most important thing is not profits but, rather, how large the company can grow and how quickly it can accomplish this growth. This is due to the hope that, if Netflix can achieve the largest market share possible, it will have a near-monopoly and should have, in theory, the potential to dictate terms for customers and business partners in any way that it sees fit. It is because of this mindset that shares fell. You see, while management did pretty well on sales and phenomenal earnings, subscriber growth was lackluster at best. In its Domestic Streaming segment, only 162,000 subscribers were added (though 290,000 were added as paying customers). The fell short of the 500,000 estimate given by management earlier this year. Internationally, the company added just 1.52 million subscribers (1.90 million paid), a miss from the 2 million previously forecasted. Because this growth is now lower than people had hoped, the timeline to that near-monopoly that growth investors want just got longer, which means it is all the less appealing. No company can grow at a fast pace forever. At some point, all companies achieve or come close to achieving market saturation and it's difficult to move too far out of your core competencies (though certainly not impossible) in order to grab hold of growth potential elsewhere. My own theory is that, to some degree, that is coming to pass with their Domestic Streaming business. It is true that churn (due to customers leaving after having prices increase) is attributable to much of the shortfall this past quarter and it's probable that next quarter's growth in this segment will be larger than we saw this quarter, but when you look at the sheer number of people in the U.S., growth can't go on for much longer. You see, as of right now, there are around 322.48 million people in the U.S. and only 46 million of them are paying for Netflix each month. This comes out to about 14.3% of the U.S. population. However, we also need to consider that individuals within a household are likely to share the service and, although there may be some cases where people in the same household have separate subscriptions, this is likely the minority. With an average household size in this country of 2.54 people, if we make the assumption that the max, on average, number of subscribers per home equals one and if we are generous and assume that people don't share their passwords (I know plenty of people who do), the largest Netflix could grow here would be to 126.96 million customers. So, instead of having 143 people out of every 1,000 people in the country paying for the service, they are actually at 36.2%, or 362 out of every 1,000. As I already mentioned, this does not factor in sharing and it also does not factor in the fact that some people will never pay for the service, either because they are elderly and not into technology, because they are cannot afford it, because they have alternative means of watching content, or one of any other number of reasons people can come up with. I do think that, while Netflix will continue to grow modestly in the U.S. for a while, its International Streaming segment has a great deal of potential. Compared to the same quarter last year, the segment's paid membership count is up 56.6% and, at only 33.89 million people, is still very small compared to the rest of the population of the world. The problem here, though, is that it's terribly unprofitable. During the second quarter, the segment generated a contribution loss of 9.1% (compared to a gain of 34.3% in the Domestic Streaming segment). The important thing, though, is that this represents a meaningful improvement over the same quarter a year earlier, when the loss was a whopping 20.2%. Although the cost of sales of the service dropped from 93% to 92.1% during this period, it was the marketing expense that really helped, which plummeted from 27.2% of sales to 17%. At this time, I have no plans to buy shares of Netflix because I want to see earnings increase more and/or the share price fall more than it already has. However, I am of the firm opinion that Netflix is in the middle of an exciting transition that will take it from being a growth-oriented enterprise into being focused on two areas; margin expansion in the U.S. and fast growth everywhere else. On the bottom line, it may be difficult to achieve this margin expansion in the short run but it will likely happen at some point. However, I do suspect that the road for the business will be extremely bumpy moving forward. This is because, as the firm's International Streaming segment, which already makes up 37.6% of sales compared to 27.7% of sales last year, eventually overtakes its Domestic Streaming segment, the low (but improving) margins outside of the U.S. will hurt overall performance. At this moment, it's clear that Netflix is transitioning and this is really the first major step on its road to maturity. At some point in the future, I believe Netflix will likely be far larger than it is today but most of that will come from the fast-growing, poor margin overseas sales. During this time, investors should not be surprised to see the company's profits behave erratically and this will almost certainly cause unwelcomed volatility for many of its shareholders. On the other hand, for those of us monitoring this transition and waiting for the right opportunity to buy, this is a very welcomed sight and, when we do buy, it means that the risk associated with the business will likely be lower than it is today.
