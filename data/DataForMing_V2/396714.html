What Per Share Price Has Apple Actually Paid To Buy Back Its Stock? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple’s buyback program has decreased the share count by 17%. The price paid pretty much equals what the shares are trading at. After a decent percentage of the almost 200 comments on my last article describing Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) dividend and buyback program which suggested the buyback program was not worthwhile I thought it would be helpful to actually calculate what the company has paid to repurchase its stock. I've also included an analysis of the number of Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) it has awarded employees since that partially offsets the decrease in the number of shares being bought. Apple announced last week that it was increasing its stock buyback program from $140 to $175 billion and that it would be done by March 2018. Starting in the December 2012 quarter with a $1.95 billion Accelerated Share Repurchase (ASR) program through the March 2016 quarter Apple has spent $114 billion to buy 1.24 billion shares. This works out to an average cost of $91.98. While this is a positive return with the stock around $93 it is barely ahead of the game. With the company making about 1% on its cash it is behind on a total return basis. Not surprisingly when you break it down on what timeframes the shares were bought the start of the program has been much better vs. shares bought since the September 2014 quarter. Here is a detailed analysis: · August 2012: $2 billion, average price $68.31 · April 2013: $12 billion, average price $69.55 · January 2014: $12 billion, average price $89.39 · August 2014: $9 billion average price $110.40 · Fiscal 2013: $9 billion, average price $66.30 · Fiscal 2014: $24 billion, average price $83.77 · Fiscal 2015: $30 billion, average price $117.68 · 1Q 2016: $3 billion, average price $115.46 · 2Q 2016: $7 billion, average price $97.54 Apple awarded just under $5 billion in RSUs last year Apple awarded 45.6 million shares of RSUs in fiscal 2015 that were worth $4.8 billion ($105 average). This was lower then the 59.3 million shares for $4.4 billion in fiscal 2014 ($74 average) but more than the 39.4 million shares for $3.1 billion in fiscal 2013 ($79 average). Since RSUs retain value even if the stock price goes down (vs. options that lose value or are worthless if the strike price is more than the stock price when they expire) unless someone leaves the company so their remaining RSUs don't vest some of the benefits of the buyback program are offset by Apple's equity awards (but that is part of a tech company's compensation). As a percentage of shares outstanding the RSUs represented 0.78%, 0.94% and 0.60% of fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 shares, respectively. Share count has decreased from 6.6 to 5.5 billion shares over the past 3 1/2 years From Apple's 10-K it had about 6.585 billion shares outstanding as of October 19, 2012. Over the course of 3 ½ years the share count has been reduced to 5.477 billion as of April 8 this year. This is a 17% reduction in the number of shares. From an EPS perspective using the $8.30 fiscal 2016 EPS estimate I derived from the 17 sell-side analyst reports I read after Apple announced its March quarter results if Apple had not bought back the shares its EPS would be about $7.27 ($7.10 from the larger share count and $0.17 from the additional earnings on the cash). At the same $93 share price its PE multiple would rise from 11.2x to 12.8x (assuming the additional cash on its balance sheet doesn't change the impact). The additional cash may not be valued enough by investors to justify the larger PE multiple. The company has about $61 billion remaining of its $175 billion authorization. Assuming it pays $100 per share on average (vs. the $93 it is trading at this morning) it would buy back 610 million shares or 11% of its remaining shares. Overall Apple has barely made any money by buying back its shares and it could be argued that it has lost money since it could have earned some rate of return on the cash spent and had to pay interest on the debt it took on. However the company has too much cash and buying back stock I think is the best use of it given the very reasonable and in many aspects low valuation of the shares. Yes I'm expecting the shares to go back up in price. The company is more than fully funding its R&D efforts, I don't think it should be doing large acquisitions (and if anyone mentions Tesla I think that would be a horrible use of it since it loses money, the car industry has low margins and a lot of the stock value is due to Elon Musk being at the company and I don't see him staying if Apple buys it) and the dividend strategy is to raise it over many years (and is hampered by having to use US cash for dividends and buybacks ). I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.
