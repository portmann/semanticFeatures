How Apple Should Be More Like Microsoft - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Both Apple and Microsoft have a lot of cash on their balance sheets, and return significant amounts of capital in dividends and repurchases. However, Microsoft is much more aggressive in returning cash to shareholders, specifically through very high dividend growth. Microsoft's 3.2% yield is almost twice Apple's 1.8% yield. Apple should take a page from Microsoft's book and return a greater percentage of its free cash flow, even if it has to issue more debt. Both Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) have excellent balance sheets stuffed with cash, have strong fundamentals, and reward their shareholders with rising dividends and share buybacks. But in one key area, Apple falls short of Microsoft. Microsoft is much more aggressive than Apple in returning cash as a percentage of its free cash flow. Microsoft provides a much higher dividend yield and also much higher dividend growth than Apple. For an income investor who might be choosing between the two, here's which one may be the better stock to buy for dividends. Both Apple and Microsoft include a mix of dividends and share repurchases in their capital allocation programs. The difference between them is that Apple is more conservative when it comes to returning cash to shareholders. The company prefers to retain more free cash flow and keep a greater portion of its cash on hand, presumably to invest back into the business in new products, whereas Microsoft returns more of its free cash flow to shareholders. Over the first three quarters of its current fiscal year, Apple repurchased $22 billion of its own stock and paid an additional $8 billion in dividends, for a total capital return of $30 billion. It generated $60 billion of free cash flow in the same period , meaning Apple's capital returns represented 50% of its free cash flow. Meanwhile, in Microsoft's recently concluded fiscal year , it utilized $9.88 billion to pay dividends and $14.44 billion to repurchase shares. That represents a total capital return of $24 billion in fiscal 2015. In the same period, Microsoft generated $23 billion of free cash flow, leaving a cash shortfall, which has been filled by raising debt. This willingness to distribute more of its free cash flow has allowed Microsoft to increase its dividend at far higher rates than Apple. Income investors should note Microsoft's 3.2% dividend yield, which is well above Apple's 1.8% dividend. Over the past five years, Microsoft has increased its dividend by 17% compounded annually, including its recent 16% dividend raise. Since Apple instituted its current dividend program in late 2012, it has increased its dividend by 11% compounded annually. That is a respectable number, but again falls short of Microsoft. Microsoft isn't afraid of raising debt to return a greater portion of cash to shareholders, and nor should it be. While some investors shudder at the prospect of a company taking on debt, it's a financially sound strategy right now. That's because interest rates remain extremely low, and Microsoft can take advantage of this by issuing cheap debt and can create value in excess of the cost. For example, Microsoft trades for 16 times its adjusted earnings per share in fiscal 2015. That represents a 6% earnings yield. In addition, the company's dividend stands in excess of 3%. By taking out debt and using the proceeds to repurchase shares and increase dividends, the returns are greater than the cost of the debt being issued. None of this has jeopardized Microsoft's balance sheet. In fact, Microsoft is one of only three U.S. companies to hold the AAA credit rating from Standard & Poor's. It makes sense to leverage its excellent balance sheet strength to create additional value. Microsoft has been able to retain its top-notch credit rating even though it returns more to shareholders than it generates in free cash flow, and utilizes debt to make up the difference. It stands to reason that Apple would not endanger its own credit rating, by pursuing a more aggressive capital return program. And, it's worth noting that investors have not punished Microsoft for its more aggressive capital returns. Far from it; if anything, Microsoft's stock has benefited from its significantly higher dividend yield and stock buybacks, as a percentage of free cash flow. Microsoft is valued at 16 times its trailing twelve month adjusted earnings per share, while Apple trades for 13 times earnings. Clearly, investors are not punishing Microsoft. That serves as an indication that investors understand and agree with the financial strategy Microsoft is employing. Some investors may counter that Apple can't be more aggressive with its capital returns, because it holds the vast majority-approximately 89%--of its cash overseas . That's true, but it's also true that Microsoft holds a large amount of its cash overseas as well. That is the inevitable cost of generating the majority of revenue and profit outside the United States, which is the reality nowadays for most large multi-national companies such as Apple, Microsoft, and many others. But that hasn't stopped Microsoft from being more shareholder-friendly by paying a strong 3.2% dividend, and as far as I can tell, Microsoft has not had to cut back on its strategic growth initiatives. It's true that Apple has taken on debt in recent years to finance its cash returns. At the end of last quarter, it held $47 billion in long-term debt, up from $28 billion year over year. But Apple can still take out a lot more debt and retain an excellent balance sheet. The company's total debt to total assets ratio is still a very healthy 53% and its long-term debt to equity ratio is a comfortable 37%. This is a testament to Apple's strong balance sheet and immense financial flexibility. As a result, it may be a good idea for Apple to take a page from Microsoft's book, and significantly increase its dividend going forward.
