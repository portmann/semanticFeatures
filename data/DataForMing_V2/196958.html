Disney's Studio Entertainment Segment Poised For Huge FY '16 Box Office Gains - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Disney's Studio Segment is poised for a dramatic rise in FY '16 Box Office Performance. The newest Star Wars film is only the beginning of a FY '16 Box Office Bonanza that should dramatically outperform FY '15. Disney's Studio Segment will help the company to continue to grow Operating Income in FY '16 as growth in Media Networks slows. I have recently written about the market's concerns regarding Disney's (NYSE: DIS ) ability to continue its impressive growth in operating income as the company's Media Networks Segment, the largest contributor of revenue and earnings, slows its pace of growth in coming years. The Market's gravest concerns over the Media Networks Segment are likely overblown (see here for a more complete analysis), but the company has indicated that growth in its Media Networks will slow as the content delivery landscape evolves. It is therefore important for investors to identify the areas in the company that will offset the slowing growth in Media Networks. In short, all of the other major segments are growing strongly and will likely continue to do so. Perhaps that strongest driver of Disney's franchise strategy is the company's Studio Segment that generates some of the most beloved content on the planet from Disney Animation, Pixar, Marvel, Disney Studios, and Lucasfilms. In the company's FY '15 Disney's Studio Segment released 8 major films including the highly anticipated Avengers: Age of Ultron, the critically acclaimed box office hit Inside Out, and the live action Cinderella that impressed critics and audiences around the world. Despite the success of Disney Studios in FY '15, with operating income growing 11% in the first 9 months of the company's Fiscal Year, it is highly likely that the segment's FY '16 revenue and income will significantly outpace it as the company plans to release more films with even higher levels of consumer anticipation. Disney's Studio Entertainment Segment has performed impressively in FY '15, but a detailed analysis of the planned FY '16 releases to FY '15 reveals more films with higher levels of audience anticipation. Admittedly, it is not possible to predict specific box office performance of all films, but it is possible for a reasonable estimate to be gleaned from levels of audience anticipation (determined by a variety of metrics), the performance of previous films in a franchise, and patterns of audience behavior over time. The chart below compares Disney's FY '15 major releases to those scheduled for release in FY '16. The FY '15 films have been paired with their FY '16 analogs that were determined by target audience and similar box office potential. Major Drivers of Box Office Out Performance The biggest grossing film for Disney in FY '15 was Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron, which grossed 1.4 billion at the worldwide box office. In order for the Studio Segment to significantly outperform in FY '16, Star Wars Episode 7 will have to best the Avenger's Box Office. The latest levels of audience anticipation as measure by trailer views, some 88 million in the first 24 hours of the second trailer's release, strongly suggests Star Wars will handily beat the Avengers. A Morgan Stanley box office analysis puts the estimated box office at 1.95 billion worldwide Marvel's release of the next film in the Captain America saga provides yet another opportunity for the company's studio segment to outperform FY '15 during its FY '16. The last Captain America film, the Winter Soldier, grossed 714 million worldwide, nearly doubling the original film's worldwide total. The new film, set for release in May, will have the additional draw of many of Marvel's most beloved characters including Iron Man, and Spiderman appearing for the first time in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Even if the film performs only as well as the second in the series, it will best Ant-Man's box office by over 300 million dollars. In the above chart Alice Through the Looking Glass was paired with Into the Woods primarily because it is a live action fairytale with a large cast of well known actors, but the comparison falls apart pretty quickly after these surface level similarities. The previous live action film starring Johnny Depp, who will be returning as the main attraction in the second film, grossed over a billion dollars at the worldwide box office in 2010. If this second Depp film earns even three quarters of the original its worldwide Box Office would equal FY '15's Cinderella and Into the Woods. Another major driver of FY '16's year over year gains is that the studio will be delivering three additional major releases over FY '15. These additional releases will provide obvious opportunity for the Studio Segment to grow revenue and operating income from FY '15 to FY '16. Box Office Gross Translates to the Bottomline A fair criticism of the central claim of this article is that growing studio revenue from dramatically rising Box Office receipts does not necessarily translate to improved operating income from the company's Studio Entertainment Segment. This is a bit of uncertainty that a reasonable investor should be willing to acknowledge and accept as Disney's management has a strong track record of managing costs and limiting risk despite a few notable outlier films in recent years (John Carter and Lone Ranger). Disney will very likely continue to grow its operating income over the coming company fiscal year on the back of its Studio Entertainment, Parks, and Consumer Products segments. The Studio Entertainment Segment should see a significant rise in Box Office revenue from a larger and even more anticipated slate of films from its strong franchises of Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar, and Disney Animation.
