Alibaba And Kabam Are Helping Disney Monetize Its Marvel Assets - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Disney's $4 billion investment on Marvel Entertainment is paying off big time. Aside from movies-related revenue, the Marvel assets are getting monetized through mobile games. Kabam's 4-month old "Marvel Contest of Champions" mobile game is the 7th top-grossing iPhone game in the U.S. Disney (NYSE: DIS ) is reaping tons of financial benefits from its brave $4 billion bet on Marvel Entertainment in 2009. Content is king, and Marvel's huge library of iconic comics characters is helping Disney generate billions in revenue. The upcoming Avengers: Age of Ultron movie is touted to be Disney's biggest moneymaker this year. Unfortunately, Mr. Tim Beyers of Motley Fool believed last year that Disney made more money on its Pixar investment than from its gamble on Marvel. Below are Mr. Beyers' charts explaining why he believes the $7.4 billion purchase of Pixar is more beneficial to Disney. I cannot refute the claims of Mr. Tim Beyers and will just accept his assessment. Since Disney is allegedly not getting the best return from its $4 billion investment on Marvel, I humbly suggest that the management licenses the Marvel assets to more mobile game publishers like Kabam . Unlike movies and home Blueray/DVD sales, the mobile games industry is immune to piracy. The Avengers: Age of Ultron movie would probably be on PopCorn Time and torrent sites pretty soon. The rampant popularity of PopCorn Time's PC and mobile app could mean that Age of Ultron won't be able to replicate the $1.52 billion global-wide gross sales of the first Marvel Avengers movie. Thanks to the July 2014 announcement from Disney and Kabam, Marvel's iconic super hero characters are getting monetized aside from piracy-prone movies-related ventures. Kabam's blockbuster arcade fighting mobile, Marvel Contest of Champions , got launched only last December, but it is already the 7th top-grossing iPhone game in America. Greed is good in freemium arcade fighting games. Kabam's $20 price tag for premium three-star superheroes has helped Marvel Contest of Champions get average daily sales of $240k. Disney's share of Kabam's strong cash flow from Contest of Champions is more impressive because there are gamers gambling $100 for a (very slim) chance to get a four-star Marvel superhero. Kabam proved that the 1990s style of arcade fighting games can be a moneymaking genre in mobile gaming. Strategy games like Clash of Clans and match-3 puzzle games like Candy Crush Soda used to dominate the money charts before Marvel Contest of Champions came along. The pay-to-win nature of freemium games applies to Contest of Champions. Kabam's developers implemented a rock-paper-scissor rule to the fight dynamics between the six different types of heroes and villains. Every competitive gamer would have to buy six $20 three-star superheroes so he could take advantage of the Class Bonus given when fighting against other heroes in Contest of Champions. The rock-paper-scissor relationship in Marvel Contest of Champions is like this: The strong urge to dominate other players in the Player-versus-Player arena has inspired my Japanese Alliance leader to buy six $20 three-star premium heroes. Premium heroes are required because the free one-star/two-star heroes randomly given out by Kabam to freeloaders are also not strong enough to finish the single-player campaign of Contest of Champions. I did not spend money on Contest of Champions because I previously believed that $20 for just one hero is too expensive. The frustration of using two-star heroes made me quit playing it. However, Kabam's decision to release an Age of Ultron-related update convinced me to play Contest of Champions again today. The Age of Ultron expansion single-player campaign on the Android version of Contest of Champions has the Chapter 1 content. New content is always good to keep the attention of gamers. Contest of Champions' success goes well with Disney's decision to allow Kabam to develop another Marvel-inspired mobile game. Another $240k/day sales generating mobile game is always great for Disney's licensing revenue stream. Kabam's library of $20 three-star heroes might also soon get bought by millions of Chinese mobile gamers. Alibaba's (NYSE: BABA ) $120 million payment for a 10% stake in Kabam requires Alibaba to market Contest of Champions and other Kabam games to Chinese mobile gamers. Venture Beat reported earlier this month that Kabam is now preparing to launch Marvel Contest of Champions in China. The $240k average daily sales from U.S. iPhone gamers might soon be bested by China's strong growth in iOS gaming. China is now the third-biggest revenue generator for the $30.3 mobile games industry. Disney's Marvel IP assets need to be aggressively monetized via piracy-free freemium mobile and PC games. The total $91.5 billion global video games industry is much bigger than the Hollywood movie/DVD sales industry. Mobile games, which is the biggest revenue generator for apps, helped Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iTunes Store billings grow bigger than Hollywood's U.S. box office revenue. If Disney helps Kabam do $9 million TV ads like what Supercell did, Contest of Champions might be able to replicate the six-figure average daily sales of Clash of Clans and the Candy Crush Saga game of King Digital (NYSE: KING ). Mobile games like Clash of Clans helped Supercell earn $1.7 billion in revenue last year. Mobile games could match the earnings potential of hit Hollywood movies. Margins on selling virtual items to players of freemium games are also high like those hit Hollywood movies. Out of the $1.7 billion revenue, Supercell gained a profit of $565 million in 2014. The long-term success of any mobile game requires aggressive advertising. Supercell spends hundreds of millions of dollars annually to make sure the two-year old Clash of Clans game continue to attract big-spending players. Kabam's $400 million revenue in 2014 is clear evidence that Contest of Champions' monetization is being done by expert freemium games managers. We can use a 5x multiplier to include sales to non-U.S. iOS/Android gamers and guesstimate the potential global average daily sales of Contest of Champions. $240,000 x 5 x 365 days = $438 million Even if we use a lower 3x multiplier, the potential global daily sales from Contest of Champions is still big enough to warrant marketing support from Disney. In the same manner that Disney uses the popularity of Contest of Champions to promote Age of Ultron, some TV/online advertising effort should also be spent to promote Marvel Contest of Champions to lure more big-spending mobile gamers. Disney is a Buy . In spite of the threat of torrent sites like PopCorn Time, I am highly confident that Age of Ultron will still post a 9-figure global gross sales. The alleged less-than-perfect monetization of Marvel assets is also slowly being addressed through third-party licensing. The mobile games industry is a future gold mine for the company. Disney allegedly dared to invest $250 million on fantasy sports game website, DraftKings . A $250 million development/marketing budget for non-sports related mobile/PC games might also help arcade fighting games like Marvel Contest of Champions achieve the 9-figure annual sales of Clash of Clans and Candy Crush Soda. Kabam has capable developers to create a crossplatform Marvel-themed rival game that will compete with the $1-billion/year revenue-generating League of Legend massive online battle arena game owned by Tencent ( OTCPK:TCEHY ). Mr. Beyers' less-than-perfect view over the $4 billion bet on Marvel could change once Disney starts announcing 9-figure sales numbers for mobile or PC games related to Marvel's IP. The most important thing is that hit Marvel-related movies (and games) still helped Disney improve its ROE and free cash flow over the past five years.
