Boeing: Order Books Are Not Bubbles, But Should Decline At Some Point - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Fluctuation of order backlog is healthy. Both Boeing (NYSE: BA ) and Airbus (OTCPK: OTCPK:EADSF /OTCPK: OTCPK:EADSY ) have their order books standing at record highs. The filled order books reflect the high demand for fuel efficient aircraft as well as new aircraft needed to support growth. Figure 1: Current Market Outlook provided by Boeing (Source: boeing.com ) Figure 1 shows there will be need for approximately 36,770 airframes of which 34,280 can be supplied by Boeing and Airbus. During 2014 Boeing (723) and Airbus (629) delivered 1352 airframes, leaving 32928 airframes. In 2015 (Q1), 231 airframes were delivered, which leaves 32,697 airframes. Taking into account the current backlog for Boeing (5715) and for Airbus (6373), the remaining orders to be divided are about 20,609 airframes. Assuming that order inflow will be split equally, Boeing still can expect orders for 10,310 aircraft in the coming 19 years. This means that Boeing can expect 542 orders per year on average, well below current delivery levels. As can be seen from the figure there are still a lot of orders to be divided between Boeing and Airbus. So to meet demand Airbus and Boeing can expect significant order inflow, but I don't expect the order inflow to be continuously robust as it has been in the last years. In the coming years the Boeing will be ramping up production rates, which means that as long as order inflow remains higher than production the order book will grow. I expect that Boeing will be able to have their order books rise at moderate levels in the coming years. On the other hand order inflow is rather cyclic, instead of showing continuous increase in orders. This has to do with older aircraft that need to be phased out, oil prices, growth of the market (supported by economic growth) and new aircraft entering the market. The current orders books are supported by: Replacement orders: Older aircraft such as the Boeing 767 and to some extent the Airbus A330ceo need to be replaced. The Boeing 787 and the Airbus A330neo are some suitable aircraft to replace these older aircraft. Additionally the Boeing 747 needs replacement, the Boeing 777 and Airbus A350 can fill in that spot. Oil prices: Most orders that Boeing and Airbus received were placed during the time that oil was still trading at high levels. Currently oil is trading near a price of $55 per barrel. So currently the urge for airlines to buy fuel efficient aircraft faded a bit, but it has to be noted that oil prices have been on the rise again and the purchase of aircraft is a long term investment. This means that airlines have to look at the long term forecast for oil prices to decide to buy new airframes or not. Although oil prices have crashed, I expect oil prices to rise in the coming years again aided by higher demand for oil as economic recovery continues and picks up pace in the Eurozone as well. Figure 2: Forecast oil price per barrel (Source: knoema.com ) Growth: With the economies all over the world recovering again, demand for air travel will rise. To meet market demand airlines will have to grow for which new aircraft are required. The order books look healthy to me as all orders are placed to replace and support growth. I don't think the current filled order books are a bubble, but are based on robust need for replacement and to support growth. In my view at some point the attractiveness to continue placing orders for aircraft will fade. This has the following reasons: Availability of delivery slots. With current order books it will take years between order placement and delivery. For airlines it might be wise to postpone making a financial commitment for airframes (order) that will stretch in the length of many years. It is not beneficial for any airline to place orders and having to wait 5 years (if not more) to take delivery. Up to this point airlines were willing to wait, because oil prices were high (in that case costs can be reduced by purchasing fuel efficient aircraft as soon as possible) and the airline market recovered from the recessions of economies around the world (this triggered airlines to start growing the fleet again to meet demand, additionally fleet renewal programs that were initially postpone due to tough economic times gained traction). In the past years new aircraft have entered the market or are about to enter the market. A few examples are the Boeing 787, Boeing 737MAX, Boeing 777X, Airbus A350, Airbus A330neo and Airbus A320neo. This created a high order inflow in the past years and although demand remains high, I think a lot of airlines will not place a follow up order until the aircraft are delivered and have proven themselves. A lot of orders are a combination of firm orders and purchase rights for additional airframes. A lot of times these purchase rights are being firmed up after an airlines has started taking delivery of the airframes initially ordered. Taking into account the 2 points above I think that order inflow will decline at some point. Ordering aircraft would become more attractive again, once delivery slots are moved forward in time which can be done by increasing production rates. I think that order books will remain more or less steady (or show moderate growth) in the coming years and after that decline due to higher delivery (outflow) and slightly lower order inflow. Once order books show moderate decline again and production rates remain high airlines will probably order airframes again (if demand for air travel remains high), because airlines can take delivery of airframes rather quickly when production rates are high and order books are not as filled as they currently are. Boeing already has been increasing production rates for the Boeing 737 and Boeing 787 and it is likely that Airbus will follow soon. Growing order books don't say a lot about success, but say more about demand. The current order books signal a strong demand. A declining order book signals that order inflow is smaller than the number of deliveries and at some point production rates need to be cut or order inflow needs to pick up pace again. A steady order book (with or without moderate growth) signals strong demand as well as balanced production rates. Currently I think order books will still show moderate growth for the coming years, but with about 10,000 airframes to be ordered over 19 years (500 airframes per year), I do expect that production rates to decline at some point. This then again will make ordering airframes more attractive. The manufacturer that is able to deliver to the customer fastest already has a big advantage in winning an order. A good example of this is the deal between Delta (NYSE: DAL ) and Airbus, where Boeing was not able to offer attractive delivery slots to Delta Air Lines, due to the robust order backlog for the Boeing 787. Robust order books show high demand for aircraft In the coming years I expect order books to show moderate growth In the years after, I expect order books to decline. This is not a bad sign as it reduces the time between order placement and delivery of an airframe, making ordering aircraft attractive again. The company that has biggest order back log is not necessarily the best. A better measure to compare value for investors are the delivery rates and operating margins.
