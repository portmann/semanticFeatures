The Apple Watch Fuss Is Overblown - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Analyst notes are rather negative regarding the Watch. Company may not even provide data until sales are truly meaningful. We've seen a bit of weakness in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) shares in recent weeks. One reason why is that we've seen a number of negative reports regarding the company's newest product, the Apple Watch. I believe that a lot of this fuss is overblown, and in this article, I detail what investors should really take away from all of this recent news. The first pass of analyst estimates regarding sales data for Apple's fiscal Q3 (calendar Q2) show how divided the street is. Those ten estimates range from 3 million units to 5.7 million, which is a sizable range. Additionally, while a lot of people are trying to pinpoint exact Watch sales for the quarter, Apple may not even disclose actual sales. The company provided the following statements regarding its financials on its Q4 conference call back in October 2014: We'll be creating a new reporting category called other products. This will encompass everything we report in the accessories category today including Beats headphones and speakers, Apple TV and peripherals and accessories for iPhone, iPad, Mac and iPod. In addition, we will begin to include iPod sales in the other products category and we will also reflect sales of Apple Watch in this line item once it begins shipping in early calendar 2015. And also to be also straight is I [Tim Cook] am not very anxious in reporting a lot of numbers on Apple Watch because of the - and giving a lot of detail on it because our competitors are looking for it and so aggregating it is helpful from that point of view as well. Analysts and investors will try to estimate Watch sales from the financial data we get from the company. Additionally, you can expect a number of questions regarding the Watch on the conference call, but I'm not sure what management will disclose. I wouldn't be surprised if Tim Cook or someone else states that sales are doing "extremely well" or "surpassing expectations", but without some sort of context those phrases are useless. Sales of the Apple Watch obviously depend on a number of factors. We've seen multi-week waits for shipping times, as most expected production to be slow early on. Apple only launched the product in a limited number of countries at first, which makes sense if you are production constrained. After things settled down, a second set of markets was added, likely meaning the supply/demand ratio was more in balance. Last week, there seemed to be a bit of panic when research firm Slice Intelligence published its latest note on the Apple Watch. Slice noted that Apple Watch sales in the US had slowed down dramatically since launch. While some decline was to be expected, the sharp drop in the chart below seemed to worry investors. Slice estimated that sales of the Watch in late June were below 10,000 units a day in the US. Also, the firm noted that roughly two-thirds of US sales have been the entry-level model, with less than 2,000 total sales of the luxury Apple Watch Edition. Slice estimated 2.8 million total US sales through mid-June. Lately, we've seen a number of other negative reports, summarized below: Deutsche Bank - analyst estimated 3.9 million units for fiscal Q3, a figure below street average, and noted that investors will be disappointed if Apple does not provide an actual sales figure number at the earnings report. BMO Capital - Kept its fiscal Q3 Watch estimate at 3.5 million units, a bit below the DB estimate, but also cut its fiscal 2016 estimate by 3 million units to 27.5 million units. Pac Crest - Analyst there cut his fiscal 2015 estimate by 0.5 million units to 10.5 million, while also cutting fiscal 2016 figure by 3 million units to 21 million. While we've seen a bunch of concerns over the Apple Watch, a number of analysts have also noted very strong sales of the iPhone. These articles might have "Apple Watch cut" or a similar headline, but a number of these article detail iPhone estimates being raised, some rather significantly. This is why I'm not totally concerned about the company overall, as the Watch is going to represent a very small portion of total sales for a number of quarters. Based on current analyst estimates, the Watch may only bring in $2 billion or $3 billion in revenues during fiscal Q3. For a quarter that may top $50 billion in total sales, that probably puts the Watch as Apple's 4th largest product by overall revenues. In terms of estimates, we continue to see overall Apple numbers hiked higher and higher. In my previous article on the name, I noted how fiscal Q3 estimates had risen to a new high. That process has continued, as the average revenue forecast is now $49.04 billion, more than $1 billion above the top end of Apple's guidance range for the quarter. So despite all of this Watch "weakness", we continue to see analysts more positive on the name overall. Since the iPhone is a higher margin product currently, it is good to see sales of the smartphone doing very well. In the chart below, you can see how analyst revenue estimates for this fiscal year (ending in September) and the next have continued to soar. (Source: Yahoo! Finance analyst estimates page) In the end, there's been a lot of concern over the Apple Watch, but I think these concerns are a bit misguided. Some analysts have been cutting their estimates, but does it really matter if the company doesn't even tell us what sales are? Also, is it very meaningful if Watch sales miss by a quarter of a million if the iPhone blows past expectations by a few million sales? Despite all of these Watch estimate cuts, Apple analysts continue to raise their fiscal Q3, fiscal 2015, and fiscal 2016 revenue and EPS forecasts. That's what I'm more interested in, and if Apple continues to beat this ever-increasing bar, it should only be a matter of time before shares hit a new all-time high.
