Cabot Oil & Gas: Achieving Excellent Productivity Gains In The Eagle Ford - Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (NYSE:COG) | Seeking Alpha Cabot grew EF production by 145% yoy and 96% was liquids. Cabot's operating cost have declined 30% in South Texas. While ~91% of COG's Q1 production came out of the Marcellus, with 1,300 drilling locations in the EF, investors should not neglect that asset's potential. Cabot Oil & Gas (NYSE: COG ) is known primarily as the low-cost natural gas producer in the Marcellus shale. However, COG also has a significant and often overlooked leasehold in the Eagle Ford shale. It was the Eagle Ford that perked up COG's Q1 EPS report because not only did production grown 145% yoy, but natural gas prices in the Marcellus region continued to suffer from a lack of adequate takeaway capacity. Source: May presentation (available here ). COG has ~89,000 net acres in two consolidated leaseholds: Buckhorn and Presidio. Eagle Ford Q1 average production of 17,831 boe/d was up 145% yoy and was up 19% sequentially over Q4FY14. Of the 17,831 average boe/d during Q1, 17,071 boe/d (96%) was liquids. Even more important than the impressive liquids split were comments Cabot Oil & Gas Chairman, President, and CEO Dan Dinges made in the Q1 EPS report with respect to productivity improvements in the play. Referring to six wells located on EF acreage COG acquired in 2014 , Dinges said: "These six wells, in addition to four wells we placed on production during the fourth quarter, have outperformed the previous operators' cumulative oil production at 30, 60 and 90 days by over 50 percent on average, highlighting the value-enhancing proposition of these bolt-on acquisitions." In fact, during the Q1 conference call , Dinges said that with these improvements in operating efficiency (see graphic above) and well performance, combined with a 20-30% reduction in service cost, COG has eclipsed the same 50% return threshold at a price of $65/bbl that it had achieved one year earlier with oil at $90/bbl. In other words, that is a near $35 per barrel improvement in overall return in just one year. That is phenomenal. During Q1 Cabot drilled 24 wells in the Eagle Ford Shale to total depth and averaged 10.6 drilling days for spud-to-rig release: a 25% percent reduction compared to the 2014 drilling program. COG averaged 6.4 completed frac stages per crew day during the quarter - an increase from 5.5 completed frac stages per crew day during 2014. COG has retired two of the rigs running in the Eagle Ford at the start of the year and has only one rig currently running in the play. Dinges said COG will consider acceleration of completion activity in the EF if there is a sustained oil price recovery or further reduction in drilling and completion cost. The company has ~1,300 drilling sites in the play. Despite Cabot Oil & Gas' impressive production gains in Eagle Ford shale, Marcellus gas still dominates its production profile. Total production for Q1 was 171.4 Bcfe. At an average production rate of 1,727 MMcf/d during the quarter, the Marcellus accounted for ~155.4 Bcf (90.7%) of total overall production. However, investors should keep a close eye on that other ~10% coming from South Texas. It's a jewel of a resource and if the crude oil export ban is lifted, you could see Cabot Oil & Gas get real busy drilling its inventory of ~1,300 drilling locations.
