Why I Remain Bullish On Apple In China - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha China Mobile disclosed that 15% of its subscribers are iPhone users. This is impressive and points to significantly more upside due to the low penetration. Potential introduction of iPhone leasing, higher ARPU and higher data consumption are factors driving Appleâ€™s growth in China. On day two of the Mobile World Congress in Shanghai, China Mobile (NYSE: CHL ) unveiled data on its subscribers and their preference of device . Although Chinese smartphone brands have been gaining market share, as the case with Huawei and TCL, the most important takeaway is that there are over 125 million iPhone users on China Mobile's network. This is roughly 15% of the total subscriber base, the highest on China Mobile's network. When we look at the chart below, we can see that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) leads Xiaomi (Private: XI ) (2nd), Huawei (3rd) and Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) (4th) by 6% each. This is impressive in that the iPhone is the most used device on China Mobile's network. If we apply the same penetration rate on both China Unicom (NYSE: CHU ) and China Telecom (NYSE: CHA ), which have 260 million and 205 million subscribers, respectively, we can derive that China Unicom and China Telecom have a combined 70-75 million iPhone users. That said, together the Chinese telecom providers have a combined 200 million or so iPhone users, equivalent to 15.5% of China's total wireless subscribers. In terms of growth, from January to May of this year, Apple user growth has been 13.8%, only 2nd to first place Vivo and at the same rate as Huawei and Oppo. Although Apple has been growing at the same rate as the other Chinese makers, I believe that there is significant more upside to Apple's iPhone subscriber base as Apple takes more market share away from the cheaper local brands if the company introduces an iPhone leasing model similar to the one used in the US. Right now, carriers sell the iPhone similar to the contract plans that we have in North America. Contract terms can range from as low a RMB58/month ($9USD) to as high as RMB388/month ($60USD) and the user is locked on the network for 24 months. There is also a subsidy, but in recent years the carriers have pulled back on subsidies. Besides, most people in China prefer buying unlocked phones so subsidy is not as attractive as it is in the US. Where I can see leasing could potentially encourage users to purchase the iPhone over the other devices is that Apple continues to command a brand premium in China (judging by the highest subscriber penetration in China Mobile), and a leasing option gives Chinese users a chance to own a new iPhone every year while avoiding the costly upfront payment associated with an unlocked phone purchase or contract plans. Right now, the bulk of the iPhone models in China cost between RMB3,000 to RMB5,000. If we divide that into 24 monthly payments, that would equal to RMB125 to RMB200 per month. If we add the monthly plan, the total cost to the user would be the same as buying the phone first and paying the monthly plan later, but the added benefit is that they can enjoy newer iPhones. On the other hand, the carriers benefit from reselling the used iPhones in the secondary market, such as the lower tier cities where local brands dominate. This strategy allows Apple to take market share in tier 1 cities, where average user have high income, and expand into lower tier cities using a low-cost strategy. Chinese carriers are also incentivized to help Apple sell more iPhones. According to China Mobile, revenue per Apple iPhone user is 50% higher than non-iPhone users. For example, the average phone bill for China Mobile's iPhone user is RMB120 per month, compared with RMB80 for OPPO and Huawei. In addition, Apple iPhone users consume 75% more data than non-iPhone users in that average iPhone data consumption is 1.5GB/month vs. less than 1GB/month. In light of China Mobile's announcement, I believe that Apple has significantly more upside in China than what the market expects. The slowdown in China's smartphone market has been widely reported in the press, but what the media failed to see is that Apple could take more market share from the local players by pursuing leasing and creating a pricing strategy.
