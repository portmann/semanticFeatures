Buy it. Taser International (NASDAQ: TASR ): We are in a bear market where such stocks might not be rewarded. Taser is cheap and worth buying. Ruckus Wireless (NYSE: RKUS ): In the wireless category, one should buy Verizon (NYSE: VZ ), AT&T (NYSE: T ) or T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS ), but not Ruckus. Seagate Technology (NASDAQ: STX ): The stock is cheap but the 8% yield signifies a red flag. The company may not have the capital to back the yield.
