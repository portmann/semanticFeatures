Facebook rolls out 360 video for News Feed | Reuters Facebook Inc said its news feed for web and Android platform users will now support 360-degree videos. A 360 video gives an immersive experience to users by allowing them to view a scene from any angle. Such videos are created using a special set of cameras that manage to capture all 360 degrees of a scene at the same time. Support for the iOS platform will follow in the coming months, the company said on Wednesday. ( bit.ly/1YBQkdg ) Action camera maker GoPro Inc has posted a video on motocross riding in the Idaho desert, while Vice Media has released a video of on-the-ground reporting in Afghanistan. Basketball star LeBron James has also uploaded a 360 video, taking viewers behind the scenes during his workouts. Walt Disney Co has uploaded a video of its upcoming "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" movie, which allows viewers to explore the fictional planet Jakku. Facebook web users can drag a cursor and mobile users can tilt their devices in any direction to experience a 360-degree panorama view. Anyone can upload 360 videos starting today, but Facebook is not currently allowing users to run ad campaigns with the videos.
