Spirit says spare parts business lost to Boeing are small component of it | Reuters NEW YORK, April 1 Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc said on Friday that the spare part business Boeing is taking away is minimal and requires only a small adjustment in its employment. "Financially, this is small component of our business," Spirit said in a statement after Reuters reported Boeing's move on Thursday. "While our role is changing, airlines will continue to need the parts that Spirit manufactures. As a business, we frequently have changes in our work scope, and our headcount adjusts accordingly - this is a small adjustment," Spirit said.
