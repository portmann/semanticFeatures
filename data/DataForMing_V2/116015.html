A Preview Of Twitter 'Moments' - Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) | Seeking Alpha To screen ETFs by asset class, performance, yield and more, check out the ETF Hub. ETF Hub Twitter is in near-term pain as it lacks a leader. It may experience another disappointing quarter as its key initiatives have yet to be released. Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) has faced quite the media circus in the last few months as Dick Costolo stepped down as CEO and was replaced by Jack Dorsey on an interim basis. As I wrote about in a past article , the transition was awkward and left the company with someone who could only spend part of his time working for the company (with the rest of his time spent being the CEO of Square). Twitter is in a great situation in terms of the social media landscape, but investors have ignored this because Twitter is a directionless company with no leader. When compared to Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), Twitter looks out of sync. Some investors have called Twitter a niche product that can never grow to the size of Facebook and some are questioning if Twitter will ever be profitable. These are understandable prognostications, but they are wrong. Twitter still is the best situated strategically to capitalize on the live content trend. Live content is a growing trend because it is a natural progression of the internet as a whole. The internet has been a place for customization and watching content (Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) and YouTube) whenever you want. This differentiated it from TV which has live content and restricts when you can watch shows (except in the case of DVR). Internet content is now speeding up and competing in the live paradigm. This is happening for two reasons. The content is getting better and connection speeds have gotten fast enough to stream content live. Periscope is just breaking free, but it is still having growing pains because of high data and battery usage. The trend toward faster internet will end these pains and what we are left with will be a complete replacement of traditional content. While I have laid out the positive situation for Twitter, these opportunities must be executed on or else a new company (possibly Snapchat) could steal Twitter's thunder. One example of a feature which needs reworking is the newsfeed. Recently Facebook announced the ability for users to coordinate what they see in the newsfeed. It made me realize how far behind Twitter is in this aspect. Twitter doesn't even have proper algorithms to make your newsfeed more palatable let alone have the option to actually manually customize it. After algorithms are put in place, I believe Twitter should follow in Facebook's footsteps. Clearly manual customization would have to be coordinated differently than on Facebook. On Facebook, you have the relationship of being friends and can unfollow someone. This keeps the social connection, while getting rid of posts you find annoying. There may be some negative affects with this as posts you hate may actually be enacting a visceral reaction making you stay on the social network longer. I think this will be moderated because only some users will even bother customizing their newsfeed at first. This could let Facebook use it as a test run and reverse the changes if it doesn't work out. Overall making users more satisfied should be a positive as the internet and customization are synonymous. Although Twitter doesn't have the same type of connection between users it can still allow for manual user customization. In my experience, because I follow so many accounts some of my favorite accounts get buried. If tweets by John Legere dominated my newsfeed, I would spend more time on the newsfeed. What ends up happening with Twitter is that the worst accounts are most seen because they post the most often. Cleaning up your newsfeed by unfollowing some spam accounts is a hassle. Allowing users to have 10 favorite accounts to be featured in their newsfeed along with an algorithm picking out the most popular tweets and promoting them would make for a great experience. Having certain tweets favored in an algorithm gives an added incentive for an account to post good Tweets. Personally I advertise my articles and YouTube channel on Twitter. I have to post several times a day just to reach all of my followers. In essence Twitter is trying to avoid having an algorithm to democratize content akin to an online billboard. In this method everything gets seen in theory. In reality content gets drowned out; so why not at least drown out the bad content instead of the good content? Me posting the same content a few times is a bad experience which shouldn't be necessary. With the algorithm Twitter could integrate what is shown in your activity feed which shows what the accounts you follow are interacting with. This would be integrated with your personal preferences when it comes to particular accounts and topics. Since Twitter already has this activity feed which is akin to Instagram's, it wouldn't be difficult to execute. It is just a matter of having the vision to get the details sorted out perfectly. Currently the Facebook newsfeed has limited space; it is the internet equivalent of Park Avenue. Having algorithms combined with manual choice will make Twitter prime real estate and make companies value advertising in the newsfeed more. Becoming one of a user's top 10 favorite accounts would become extremely valuable. It is another layer which companies will want to gain more engagement on just like having likes on a Facebook page. Being a favorited account would be even more exclusive than a Facebook like because there would only be about 10 at the launch and only expanded to a slightly bigger amount once it gains steam. Users, of course, can like an unlimited amount of Facebook pages. The story broke recently that Twitter was toying with the idea of calling Project Lightning "Moments." This is an interesting tell for what the future holds. Obviously it has become the new buzzword for social media figures as of late. What I find interesting about this name is Twitter already has a product called Moments . It isn't a popular feature, but it must be analyzed to see what this new Moments will be like. Right now when you go to the 2014 Moments page it has the top events of the year. Each moment has a few correlated tweets. Overall, it is fairly barren. I know curation limits the amount of content per event, but there aren't many tweets even after you click 'Explore Now'. The other tab has Perspectives which shows the top five tweets of the year for some popular accounts along with the top five correlated accounts. This tab may not be relevant for the new Moments feature. The Moments which will be released in the late summer or fall will obviously be more integrated with mobile than this website. The content needs to be more extensive. What will set this bland website apart from the actual feature is the use of Periscope. I know the company may have been working on Project Lightning before it acquired Periscope, but I think it may have been a flop without it. If you imagine what Moments could look like without Periscope, there is only a certain amount of improvement you can have with 140-character tweets and some pictures and videos. I am expecting Moments to be the coming out party for Periscope. Even with the bland website, adding Periscope would instantly improve it. Seeing a few tweets about a topic will quickly inform you, preparing you for the Periscope event you are about to see. A lot of viewers watching Periscope are in the dark about what is going on in the stream when they initially click on it. Having additional information should clarify what is happening. It is the equivalent of having an article with a few sentences previewing a YouTube video, followed by the actual video posted at the bottom. It also correlates channels together making it easy to only look for 'scopes' about the specific event. Of course this whole process means that Twitter must allow 'scopes' to last more than 24 hours as I have mentioned in a previous article . As an investor, I have been a long-term believer in Twitter's future for a while. The problem with the stock in the near term is twofold. There is legitimate uncertainty regarding who the CEO will be. There is also negative investor sentiment. This is not a good combination. Since I don't know who the CEO will be, it makes me lose my edge as to where the stock will go which motivates me to sit on the sidelines. More importantly, I am worried about the next quarter's results. The MAU number actually came in line with what was expected by analysts last quarter; other metrics missing estimates caused the stock to collapse. In Chris Sacca's blog post , he mentions the possibility of a MAU decline in the future. Since, none of the positive changes I have discussed have actually been implemented yet, the possibility of a MAU disappointment is possible. If this occurs, no matter what the Periscope downloads end up being the stock will go down. I'm positioning myself to buy the stock after the earnings report and before Project Lightning/Moments is released. The positivity from the launch may help the stock in the near term. More importantly, it should increase engagement in the long term. If the stock does go down after earnings, I don't expect any CEO announcement to cause further pain. Even though I have been positive on the stock I have yet to initiate a long-term position. I wanted to purchase shares when it was at $29 last year, but I didn't have cash available. You can decide to follow my timing strategy for when to purchase it or you can choose to ignore it. Either way I believe the stock will go higher in the long term and you should own it.
