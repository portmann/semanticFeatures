Apple: Examining The iPhone's Quarterly Impact - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Analysts are above top end of Apple's guidance range. IPhone again expected to deliver about 2/3 of quarterly revenues. In less than a week, we'll get quarterly results from Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). Expectations are high after last quarter's beat. The iPhone again will be the star or the show, representing a majority of the company's revenues. In this article, I examine the financial aspect of the product in regards to the company's quarterly results. In the last four fiscal periods, Apple has shown double digit unit sales growth in the iPhone, as compared to their respective prior year periods. Consumers and investors wanted the company to launch a larger screen iPhone to be more competitive with rival products, and the company did that in late 2014. In fiscal Q4 2014, the newer phones were on sale for a short time period, but the company still was able to show 16.2% iPhone unit sales growth to 39.27 million units. Fiscal Q1 of 2015 was the monster quarter with Apple showing 45.9% growth to 74.47 million units. That high percentage growth rate was boosted by the fact that fiscal Q1 of 2014 disappointed most estimates, with Apple being production constrained. So when it comes to Q2, analysts are basically in the middle of those two growth rates, looking for about 30% growth to 56.8 million units. As usual, most of the amateur analysts are more positive, with 6 amateur analysts in the Fortune article above calling for 60 million or more. The range is 50 million to 64 million, with 2/3 of the professional analysts expecting Apple to report a number below the 56.8 million overall average. According to TrendForce, Apple had just under a 20% market share for smartphone shipments in calendar Q1 2015, implying around 58 million units. Apple's success is predominantly thanks to strong sales in China, where Apple is the number one brand. While most investors and analysts will be heavily focusing on the number of iPhones sold, I'm more curious to see what the quarter's average selling price is. There are a number of items that determine this figure, including the sales mix of models sold, where the phones are sold (currency issues), etc. Apple has seen a nice boost to average selling prices from its larger screen iPhone 6, and in the most recently reported quarter, selling prices jumped thanks to a larger mix from more expensive phones. In the chart below, you can see the quarterly ASP trend over the past two years, based on financial information from Apple's site. In the past two years, the sequential declines in ASP from fiscal Q1 to Q2 were $28 and $41, respectively. This year, the substantial rise in the dollar will provide negative pressure on the average selling price, an item mentioned in the 10-Q filing for Q1. This will be true for all products, which is why management guided to a 5 point hit to revenues in the quarter thanks to currencies, after a 4 point hit in Q1. The dollar did rise a bit more after management's forecast, providing further pressure. However, late in the quarter, Apple reportedly raised prices in many countries to combat the issue of the stronger dollar. For instance, an unlocked iPhone 6 in Canada went from $749-$969 to $839-$1,099. These higher prices reportedly will only impact a couple of sales weeks from Q2, but every extra dollar will help. The larger impact will be in the June ending fiscal Q3. In terms of year over year changes since the iPhone 6 launched, the Q4 ASP increase was $26 and the Q1 jump was $50. Given that Q1 had a larger impact from sales of newer phones, I expect Q2's number to be more in-line with that Q1 figure. If Apple is able to show another $50 year over year ASP increase, that would put the Q2 2015 figure at $646. In the end, we can combine unit sales and average selling prices to determine the total revenues coming from the iPhone. In the table below, I've provided ranges for average selling prices (across the top) and unit sales in millions (left side). With analysts expecting almost 57 million unit sales, a $10 hit to ASP from currencies (for example) is a nearly $600 million hit to revenues. The yellow highlighted range is where I personally think Apple will end up for fiscal Q2, and the total dollar values are in millions. Everyone knows the iPhone is crucial to Apple's success. However, that has become even more true recently with the iPad and iPod showing sales declines and Mac growth (in certain quarters) not matching iPhone growth. In fiscal Q1 of 2015, Apple reported that 68.61% of revenues came from the iPhone, up from 56.43% in the prior year period. My current prediction is that the iPhone will represent about 2/3 of the company's total in fiscal Q2. The iPhone is also a key driver of Apple's profits, and a larger share of the company's revenues coming from the phone usually means increased margins. In fiscal Q1, Apple reported gross margins of 39.87%, above many expectations, thanks to the blowout iPhone sales quarter. The company guided to 38.50% to 39.50% for gross margins in Q2, with a negative impact of over 100 basis points thanks to currency issues. Apple usually does pretty well with its gross margin figures. As a point of reference, every 100 basis points of gross margins will equal about 7 cents of EPS for this quarterly report. Any hit to the company's margins makes it a lot tougher for Apple to beat, given the rise in estimates seen in the table below. Apple guided to $52 billion to $55 billion for fiscal Q2 revenues, and that was before a further rally in the dollar plus the reported price raise. Analysts are more than $750 million above the top end of the company's range, so expectations are very high, especially after last quarter's tremendous report. The iPhone will need another strong period to help Apple overcome such high expectations.
