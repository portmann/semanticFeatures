Why China Adds Unprecedented Strategic Value To Apple - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple's growth in China will be accompanied by more favorable regulations in the coming years. China will be more open to foreign direct investment and will enforce intellectual property more aggressively. Furthermore, U.S.-based companies will be granted national treatment, removing industry restrictions, assuming the bilateral investment treaty with the United States goes through. This plays to Apple's strengths because it will allow Apple to redeploy capital in China more effectively and explore various strategies to further reduce the effective tax rate. This also gives Apple the ability to rely more heavily on foreign R&D to drive innovation in the company's products and services, and opens the door for Chinese acquisitions. I guess the most eye-popping figures from Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Q3 earnings report were the Chinese iPhone shipment figures, which grew by 112% year-over-year. I think this is pretty important to think about going forward because the growth story in China is nowhere near over and there are some underlying catalysts that will improve the ability to unlock value in the Chinese operating segment, thus elevating the return on equity for shareholders. The Q&A went into great lengths to discuss the potential growth potential of China. At least according to Tim Cook: Yeah, it's a very good question, and we remain extremely bullish on China and we're continuing to invest. Nothing that's happened has changed our fundamental view that China will be Apple's largest market at some point in the future. The rise of the middle class there is continuing, and it is transforming China. I saw a recent study from McKinsey that's projecting the upper middle class to grow from 14% to 54% of households over the 10-year period from 2012 to 2022. The comments from Tim Cook more or less echoed some of my prior coverage on Apple in China. I figured the company's revenues and earnings would accelerate in the region as emerging economies are pivoting away from manufacturing and are instead creating higher value service sector jobs. The improvement in discretionary income will drive a massive increase in more price sensitive purchases, i.e. consumer electronics (durable goods). In the third and fourth plenum meetings, the central government of China plans to pursue various policies that will free up the market so it can be a more competitive environment for foreign firms investing capital into China. The fourth plenum went into greater detail about the rule of law, and furthermore, will allow investors better access to industries that were previously restricted from foreign investment. There's also a bilateral investment treaty with the United States that's in the works. This BIT between the United States and China will allow U.S. companies to gain national treatment within Chinese borders. Interestingly enough, this just so happens to coincide with the rapid growth rate of Apple's sales in China. But what's even more interesting is the easing of restrictions on foreign direct investment and the opening of various state-level economic and technological development zones. Also, the approval process has been streamlined for investments less than $300 million, which requires registration rather than approval with the NDRC (national development and reform commission). The CPC Central Committee and the State council add more detail in a recent policy briefing: As mentioned in the Opinions, a series of measures, including adjusting the standards of damage compensation and exploring the implementation of a punitive compensation system, have been raised to break the deadlock of the current protection of intellectual property rights and set up a strict IPR protection system. Since abundant capital plays as an important role in turning science and technology achievements into application, a series of reform measures have been raised to foster innovation investment, giving full play to the capital markets and improving the flexibility and convenience of loan support for innovation. These measures involve a series of preferential taxation polices among others. We not only support innovation by domestic enterprises but also encourage innovation by foreign businesses - actually we have launched many trial projects as we set up the free trade zones. More specifically, China will actively encourage foreign R&D centers to conduct research with high added value and originality. Admittedly, I quote a lot of information, but believe me the original transcript is substantially longer. I'm only able to cover the key points that I thought were the most important. First, China plans to enforce intellectual property rights more aggressively going forward. They will give favorable tax treatment to high-tech companies that invest into R&D. And finally, they're planning on cooperating with other research institutions, as they plan on freeing up the intellectual capital of its various universities for public and private sector use. This creates unique partnership opportunities and opportunities to create a more robust tech industry within China. The Chinese government is much more open-minded to foreign direct investment and is working toward opening the borders for U.S. investment. This puts Apple in a really good position both from a tax standpoint but from a strategic point of view as well. How does this play to Apple's strengths? Well, it means that Apple doesn't have to bring cash back to the United States to deploy it more effectively. It can also expect favorable tax treatment for every dollar that's invested from its Chinese subsidiaries. This lowers the effective tax rate while also allowing Apple the ability to enforce its intellectual property rights even if the technology were to be developed in China. Finally, they have freed up regulation to a point where a bilateral investment treaty will give Apple, a U.S.-based company, equal treatment to domestic Chinese companies. All of these factors make Apple's Chinese earnings just as high quality to U.S. earnings if not even more high quality because Apple can reinvest the capital back into its Chinese subsidiaries, reducing the amount of equity on the balance sheet while increasing the firm's competitive moat by virtue of its global R&D footprint. Also, Apple can pursue more M&A activity within China, which is uncharacteristic of historical M&A trends in China. While there have been a couple of big deals over the year, we haven't seen many large scale acquisitions, which is driven by a body of regulation that's likely to be improved upon in the coming year or so. Furthermore, Apple also can gain access to China's commercial bond market. However, the disadvantage to the Chinese bond market is the high benchmark yields. But no matter, Apple can simply borrow in Japan and replenish the Japanese balance sheet with Chinese earnings. Then Apple can use the debt origination to buy back shares in the United States. There's foreign currency risk by pursuing these transactions, but given the underlying trends in interest rates globally, it's likely that Apple will be able to mitigate some of these risks. Apple mentioned on its earnings conference call that it will be more globally diversified with its debt issuances, which implies that the strategic tax benefits to borrowing globally will allow the company to maintain a reasonable return on equity because it can effectively deploy cash for international M&A and repurchase shares. It can do all of these things while maintaining a mid-20s effective tax rate. Heck, the effective tax rate may drop a little further, assuming China gets more aggressive with its favorable tax policy towards tech companies. To conclude, I anticipate Apple to outperform the market over the long term. I continue to reiterate my revised price target of $136 for the duration of fiscal year 2015. China will add materially to earnings and revenue over the next five years and will bolster the company's ability to deploy capital effectively. The more open stance of China will lower Apple's interest rate and foreign currency risk by virtue of global diversification.
