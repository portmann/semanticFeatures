Apple: Maybe You Should Follow Icahn - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Only a year ago Apple and Samsung were neck and neck in terms of market share. Samsung is expanding, while Apple is shrinking. Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) reports a strong March quarter while Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) takes it on the chin. Samsung's sales for its Q1 in its mobile division were up 12% year over year while Apple's sales were down sharply. Apple guided to a further sharp decrease in sales for the June quarter. Samsung expects results to be flat despite softer markets. Those forecasts suggest the gap between these two giants will widen in Samsung's favor. This tale of two cities prompted long-time Apple bull Mark Hibben to write an SA article entitled, Apple: The Sleeping Giant Goes To War . Hibben asserts the weak Apple results were "about what [he] expected." With respect, they were worse than Hibben set out in his April 25, 2016 article in which he continued to recommend Apple as a buy. Hibben admits he did not have a lot of hard data to support his optimism. Hard data might have helped him. The hard data are more consistent with a conclusion that the sleeping giant is going to sleep rather than war. Apple is getting nowhere in China where sales fell 26% and has gotten nowhere in India where even the iPhone SE has had little traction with barely 34,000 units shipped into India since the device was launched, according to Zauba.com data. A lot depends on the iPhone 7 expected this September. The early hard data show not much to get excited about. As Gordon Kelly commented in his recent Forbes article : It was only a year and a bit ago that Apple introduced its larger iPhones and had a quarter that rivaled Samsung with both companies shipping about 73-74 million smartphones. That prompted a wave of bullish enthusiasm for Apple, including claims that Apple was about to surpass Samsung as the market leader. As it turned out, Apple did not follow through and the world returned to its previous state where Apple loses market share and Samsung continues to expand. Today Samsung has about a 60% larger share than Apple. Source: IDC as reported by Macrumors To date in fiscal 2016, Apple has shipped 126 million iPhones (75 million in Q1 and 51 million this quarter). Apple's guidance for revenue implies a further drop which I estimate will see 40-42 million iPhones shipped in the June quarter and perhaps 50-52 million in the September quarter if the iPhone 7 is out in time and enjoys a strong reception. That will put the full year somewhere in the range of 216-220 million iPhones. The results reinforce my view that Apple will turn in a full year with net income in the sub - $8.00 per share range as set out below: My estimates are a bit below the consensus , but many analysts are ratcheting down their expectations as I write, and I think the market will agree with me over time. Apple trades at a deservedly low earnings multiple and I don't see that changing until Apple can demonstrate growth again. One-time Apple evangelist Carl Icahn sees the light - he dumped his stock . Many analysts have downgraded the stock. In my view, it is just beginning. Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.
