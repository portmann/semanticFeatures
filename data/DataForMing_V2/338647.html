Facebook to overhaul UK tax structure, will pay 'millions of pounds' more: BBC | Reuters People walk in front of the Facebook logo at the new Facebook Innovation Hub during a preview media tour in Berlin, Germany, February 24, 2016. LONDON Facebook FB.0 is to restructure the way it pays tax in Britain, meaning it will pay "millions of pounds" more to the Treasury, BBC TV reported on Friday. The BBC said that following criticism of its current tax arrangements, the global tech giant would pay tax on profits generated from advertising revenue initiated in Britain instead of routing sales through Ireland for its largest advertisers.
