Bloomberg: AT&T involved in Yahoo bidding - AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) | Seeking Alpha May 25 2016, 11:12 ET | About: AT&T Inc. (T) | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor In a surprise revelation, AT&T (NYSE: T ) made a bid for Yahoo ( YHOO -2.1%) and is still in the running for the core Internet business, Bloomberg reports. They were out of the offing according to earlier reports. But they kept involved in the process through a stake in YP Holdings -- which was involved in the early round in April -- and while YP isn't pursuing the transaction any longer, AT&T is still around. The interest from the telecom giant would present a formidable challenge for presumed frontrunner Verizon (NYSE: VZ ). But Verizon didn't submit one of the highest first-round bids, a pair of the sources said. Rather just see them reduce debt then buy an asset that won't help with anything what so ever. That's just me. This shows that no one knows how many companies are budding for the assets of YHOO let alone what the bids are. Unless you can get Yahoo for $0.50 on the dollar (ie a significant discount), I see no reason for anyone to buy Yahoo. if you can't understand why the third most trafficked internet property in the world is an acquisition target then I would suggest you lack comprehension of the online advertising revenue model. Yes please explain how #3 is still failing and have to be sold off. you would think being #3 in the world could produce a hefty profit Yahoo owns a stake in Snapchat, and has streamed NFL games online seamlessly to 5 million viewers at a time. Those are two things I could see many different companies being interested in. Focus on quality.  Begin small and customers will come.  Why do you need to purchase Yahoo?  Use go 90 as a seed and let that grow.  Of course go 90 has its own quality issues. I'm not really surprised by this one tbh. AT&T was very active in initial negotiations so it's quite expected that they came back to it now. I think I will get rid of my T and get some shorts.Yahoo is an almost dead horse and the bigger the rider saddles it, the faster it dies under the heavy weight... So you will sell t and short it? Good luck! Just cuz they are possibly bidding doesn't mean they will be the winner.
