Can Yahoo Make It In Gambling? - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha Yahoo entered the fantasy sports business this summer. It is already number three in the market behind DraftKings and FanDuel. Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) reports earnings Tuesday and the expectations are very modest - $1.26 billion in revenue and 16 cents of earnings per share. But this quarter's Yahoo is not like previous quarters' Yahoo for one simple reason, sports gambling. Yahoo entered the "fantasy sports" arena just this summer , under Vice President, Media, Kenneth Fuchs , and this will be the first quarter where those numbers will be folded into the whole. While Yahoo can't be expected to dominate right away, DraftKings saw $40 million in revenue last year, with total betting volume rising nearly 10-fold to $304 million , while FanDuel was expecting $6.5 million in revenue for the second quarter alone. The market is exploding, with some calling it a $70 billion opportunity. Yahoo is said to be making rapid progress, because it already has a network of sports news sites and a radio sports network. The company is already a strong number three in the market. Analyst David Copeland told Fortune this month , and it's growing aggressively, putting 98% of incoming revenue back into the hands of players through prizes. By getting in late, Yahoo also avoids some of the "scandal" talk swirling around the sector. New York is investigating possible manipulation of results at the two larger sites. The Department of Justice and FBI have opened a preliminary investigation Nevada has called DraftKings and FanDuel "gambling" sites and forbidden them from operating in the state until they get gaming licenses. Yahoo itself has pulled out of Florida , where a federal grand jury is looking into the sector, and from other states. There are some conclusions that can be drawn. First, there is a lot of money to be made in fantasy sports. Second, Yahoo is a player. Third, this is an area that is about to come under strict regulatory scrutiny, on many levels. Yahoo, along with Disney's (NYSE: DIS ) ESPN, may be among the very few companies with the legal firepower to withstand that scrutiny. Yahoo also has something else its rivals don't have, global reach. It can take its fantasy games into any sport, or any jurisdiction, where it sees opportunity, and quickly. Axiom Capital revenue raised Yahoo stock to a buy with a price target of $45/share , against its current range of $34. Gambling won't do as much for the stock right now as a rise in Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) would, but it provides a speculative reason for seeing hope in Yahoo's organic business, which has in the past been deemed worthless by many investors.
