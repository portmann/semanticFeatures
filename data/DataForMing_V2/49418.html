JetBlue Will Let Amazon Prime Customers Stream For Free Onboard â€“ Consumerist Though it’s already the only airline to offer free WiFi, JetBlue is taking it once step further and will now let passengers who are Amazon Prime customers stream Amazon’s music and video content for free. Because let’s face it, you’ve got some binge watching of Transparent to get done and those two shrill, chatty 20somethings across the aisle will not shut up about their trip to Cabo. JetBlue’s current free WiFi for passengers is suitable for web browsing and checking email, but to get the sort of bandwidth to watch stuff, you’d have to pay about $9 to start. There’s now another option for people using Amazon’s instant video service or streaming music service: Those customers can now stream for free on their WiFi connected devices with a new plan called Fly-Fi Prime, the companies announced today . Prime users can also rent or buy other titles in the Amazon Instant Video store while in flight, listen to music on Prime Music, download e-books for Kindle and get games from the Amazon app store. The free Fly-Fi broadband Internet will be available on all JetBlue’s Airbus A321 and A320 aircraft later this year and on JetBlue’s Embraer E190 aircraft in 2016.
