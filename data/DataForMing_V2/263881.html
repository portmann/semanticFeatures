Apple's Love/Hate Relationship With Taylor Swift Heats Up - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Dec. 14, 2015 11:53 AM ET  |  About: Apple Inc. (AAPL) , Includes: ATML , BEE , BHI , BRDCY , BX , ETE , FCS , GOOG , GOOGL , HAL , JAH , NWL , P , PBY , WMB by: Chris DeMuth Jr. It has been a tense six months for anyone closely tracking the Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) relationship with Taylor Swift . In June, she pulled her album 1989 from Apple Music. This week, she is making nice, making Apple Music the exclusive home for the same album's world tour concert video. On Sunday, December 20, the video will be available on all Apple devices. This comes at an important time for Apple in their competition with Spotify and Pandora (NYSE: P ). Her earlier fight actually led to the new deal. She said that, I think I'd be leaving a huge part out if I didn't mention the blog post that I wrote. I think that is probably the starting point because I didn't have a personal relationship with Apple until that point. I'm sure there are better ways to introduce yourself than to say, 'This is what I'm upset about, please think about our industry.' It got more attention than I thought it would because I'd been echoing those sentiments for years… [Apple] had shown such humility in what they did ... so that's how we get to [here]. The concert video can be seen by Apple Music's 6.5 million paid subscribers as well as anyone in the free, three-month trial that had caught Taylor Swift's ire during the summer. Her role with Apple with go beyond the concert video. She will help promote Apple Music throughout the crucial Christmas week. Apple gets Taylor Swift and Taylor gets over $100 million. This is a big deal for Taylor Swift. It is a bigger deal for Apple Music. In other Taylor Swift news (using the word broadly), a video of a police officer lip syncing to her song Shake it Off was one of the top 10 videos for 2015 on Google's ( GOOG / GOOGL ) YouTube. The semi M&A boom keeps booming with new Atmel bid. Atmel (NASDAQ: ATML ) received an unsolicited bid to acquire the company for $9 per share in cash. Their board determined that the proposal would reasonably be expected to result in a superior proposal. Newell Rubbermaid (NYSE: NWL ) and Jarden (NYSE: JAH ) entered into a definitive deal to combine the companies. JAH holders get $21 per share in cash and 0.862 shares of NWL per JAH share. The deal will be accretive to earnings. Cost savings over the next four years will be about half a billion dollars. The deal will close in the second quarter of 2016. Halliburton (NYSE: HAL ) management told investors in meetings that the company would not agree to an extension without clear instructions from the Department of Justice on what it needed to divest to secure approval of their Baker Hughes (NYSE: BHI ) acquisition. Unless such instructions are offered, the DoJ will bring litigation to block the deal this week. Fairchild (NASDAQ: FCS ) concluded that the unsolicited proposal received on December 7th to acquire the company would not reasonably be expected to result in a superior proposal as defined in the merger agreement. Energy Transfer Equity (NYSE: ETE ) and Williams (NYSE: WMB ) entered into a standard timing agreement with the staff of the Federal Trade Commission in connection with the acquisition of WMB. Under the terms of the Timing Agreement, ETE and WMB have agreed not to consummate the proposed acquisition prior to sixty days after substantial compliance with the second requests, and not to consummate the acquisition before March 18, 2016. Bridgestone ( OTCPK:BRDCY ) and Pep Boys (NYSE: PBY ) amended their merger agreement reflecting Bridgestone's increased offer for Pep Boys from $15 per share to $15.50 per share in cash. I hate reading mediocre ideas. After being in the market for several decades, it is a real pleasure to find some consistently clear thinking. Occasionally, I have considered hiring someone capable to help me research market ideas. However, for a "home office" of my size, and perhaps yours, that is not economically practical. Now, imagine that you and others share a very knowledgeable employee for a small fraction of their salary. That is economically practical. Think about it.
