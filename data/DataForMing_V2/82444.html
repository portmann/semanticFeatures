Best And Worst: All Cap Blend ETFs, Mutual Funds, And Key Holdings | Seeking Alpha All Cap Blend style ranks third in 2Q15. Based on an aggregation of ratings of 61 ETFs and 760 mutual funds. DGRO is our top rated All Cap Blend ETF and CLTIX is our top rated All Cap Blend mutual fund. The All Cap Blend style ranks third out of the 12 fund styles as detailed in our 2Q15 Style Ratings report . It gets our Neutral rating, which is based on an aggregation of ratings of 61 ETFs and 760 mutual funds in the All Cap Blend style. Figures 1 and 2 show the five best and worst rated ETFs and mutual funds in the style. Not all All Cap Blend style ETFs and mutual funds are created the same. The number of holdings varies widely (from 4 to 3775). This variation creates drastically different investment implications and, therefore, ratings. Investors seeking exposure to the All Cap Blend style should buy one of the Attractive-or-better rated ETFs or mutual funds from Figures 1 and 2. ValueShares U.S. Quantitative Value ETF (BATS: QVAL ) is excluded from Figure 1 because its total net assets are below $100 million and do not meet our liquidity minimums. * Best mutual funds exclude funds with TNAs less than $100 million for inadequate liquidity. Jensen Quality Value Fund (JNVIX, JNVSX) are excluded from Figure 2 because their total net assets are below $100 million and do not meet our liquidity minimums. iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF (NYSEARCA: DGRO ) is our top-rated All Cap Blend ETF and Catalyst Lyons Tactical Allocation Fund (MUTF: CLTIX ) is our top-rated All Cap Blend mutual fund. Both earn a Very Attractive rating. One of our favorite stocks held by All Cap Blend funds is Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ). Over the past decade, Microsoft has grown after tax operating profit ( NOPAT ) by 13% compounded annually. The company also generates a very strong return on invested capital ( ROIC ) of 48%, placing it in the top quintile of all companies we cover. Microsoft has also generated positive free cash flow every single year since 2002, with a cumulative $130 billion in free cash flow. Microsoft's economic earnings have grown at a compounded annual rate of 13%. While the company may not be the high-powered growth machine it once was it remains a solid company that doesn't receive the credit it deserves from the market. At its current price of $46/share, Microsoft has a price to economic book value ( PEBV ) ratio of 1.0, implying the market expects Microsoft to never grow NOPAT from current levels. If Microsoft can grow NOPAT by only 7% compounded annually for the next seven years , the stock is worth $70/share today - a 55% upside. PowerShares FTSE RAFI U.S. 1500 Small-Mid Portfolio (NASDAQ: PRFZ ) is our worst rated All Cap Blend ETF and World Funds B. Riley Diversified Equity Fund (MUTF: BRDAX ) is our worst rated All Cap Blend mutual fund. PRFZ earns a Dangerous rating and BRDAX earns a Very Dangerous rating. One of the worst stocks held by All Cap Blend funds is Callidus Software (NASDAQ: CALD ). The company has failed to earn a positive NOPAT since 2006 and the company's ROIC is also very disappointing at -18%. This number means that the company is losing 18 cents for every dollar that is invested into it. As such, CALD earns our Very Dangerous rating. To justify its current price of $14/share, Callidus would have to achieve positive margins and grow revenues by 25% compounded annually for the next 29 years . Seeing as the company has only grown revenue by 17% compounded annually for the past three years while generating losses, it seems unlikely the company could sustain higher levels of growth and suddenly become profitable for nearly three decades.
