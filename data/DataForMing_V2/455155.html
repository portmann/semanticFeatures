Apple: How Low Can We Go? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Analyst complacency worries me the most. In just two weeks we will get fiscal Q3 results from Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) - what is expected to be a very dismal report. With sluggish iPhone sales leading to a large drop in both revenues and earnings, shares continue to trade under $100. As we get closer to earnings, the divide between estimates and expectations continues to grow, something that worries me given recent history. I got a bit worried on Monday morning when I saw mostly bullish analyst notes on the stock, although we did get a $2 price target cut (why bother?). I am worried because this followed a similar pattern we saw back in April ahead of what was a terrible earnings report. Take a look below at a majority of the analyst headlines from then as compared to now: (Source: StreetInsider Apple news page ) Between Apple's Q1 and Q2 reports, the average revenue estimate for fiscal Q3 declined from $49.97 billion to $47.32 billion, yet Apple still managed to guide well below that. Estimate drops have been more dramatic this time around, as the current fiscal Q4 revenue estimate is more than $5 billion below what it was on April 27th. That makes sense given how much Apple's guidance missed by. Analysts are still all over the map, however, with a range of $8.55 billion from the low estimate to the high. The most positive analyst on the street is more than 20% above the most bearish one, leading me to believe that some estimates haven't been updated in a while. Should those numbers change a bit, we're likely to see the consensus come down even more. Even though things appear rather bleak for Apple currently, the average Q3 revenue estimate is still above the company's guidance midpoint. Numbers over at Estimize are even higher, so I'm not sure the analyst cited above is correct about the buy side being more conservative than the sell-side. While product sales will definitely be important, don't discount the volatility in the US dollar during the quarter. All it takes is a few hundred million in currency impacts to shift things from a decent beat to a decent miss. So as we approach Apple earnings, Apple shares on Monday trade just pennies away from the dividend adjusted $97.23 close the day after last quarter's earnings report. As estimates continue to drop, we're now getting a wave of positive analyst reports, just as we did last quarter. While we will continue to hear that expectations are very low, they can always go lower, just as we saw in April with bad guidance. As a result, investors should tread lightly with this stock until we get a clearer picture of what the iPhone 7 will look like.
