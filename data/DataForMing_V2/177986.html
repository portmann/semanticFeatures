Game Plan For The Week - Cramer's Mad Money (9/18/15) | Seeking Alpha Sep. 21, 2015  7:40 AM ET  |  Includes: AAPL , ACN , ADBE , AZO , BBBY , BBRY , BLK , CAG , CCL , DRI , FINL , GIS , GLD , KBH , LEN , LEN.B , NKE , PANW , PIR , RDS.A , RHT , WDAY , WFC by: SA Editor Mohit Manghnani Get ready to buy high quality stocks. China is a big market for Apple and is going strong. Stocks discussed on the in-depth session of Jim Cramer's Mad Money TV Program, Friday, September 18. Forget the Fed guessing game for the time being is the advice that Cramer wants to give investors. "Would it be so terrible to focus on the real prize, buying the stocks of companies we like for the long term when they are being pulled down by short-term worries, like the ones generated by the Fed meeting?" he said. Once China is back on its feet and Europe is strong, the Fed will raise rates eventually. The fears driving the current market are no wage growth and the Chinese government selling US treasuries. With that, Cramer discussed his game plan for the week and called it the Fed-free zone. Lennar (NYSE: LEN )(NYSE: LEN.B ) reports on Monday, and so far the stock has done well during the year. Cramer recommended buying the stock on positive commentary from the company. AutoZone (NYSE: AZO ) has a history of reporting good numbers and buying back its stock. Cramer recommended buying the stock on weakness after earnings. Carnival (NYSE: CCL ) also reports on Tuesday and Cramer expects the company to report good numbers as he is bullish on new CEO Arnold Donald's work. ConAgra (NYSE: CAG ) and Darden Restaurants (NYSE: DRI ) are both good companies which are bringing out value due to activist investors. The new General Mills (NYSE: GIS ) is more natural and organic and has a great dividend. Cramer recommended buying the stock. Accenture (NYSE: ACN ): "I have been remiss in not telling you to buy shares in this giant every time they fall. Yes, it's that good," said Cramer. KB Home (NYSE: KBH ) reports Thursday and if it misses and pulls down the rest of the group, investors can take advantage and buy Lennar at lower prices. Nike (NYSE: NKE ) is one of the best performing stocks of the Dow and Cramer will be watching closely on what the company has to say about China. Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ: BBBY ) has been buying its stock like crazy and hasn't done much when it comes to earnings. Finish Line (FNL) reports on Friday and Cramer thinks that opportunity could come knocking for this stock as Nike tells a good story. CEO interview - Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) Netflix is the video streaming giant that allows streaming of TV shows, movies and original programming. The company has transformed the way TV is consumed. The stock is 100% up for the year which shows that even in a bad market, the stock is staying strong. Cramer interviewed CEO Reed Hastings to discuss all about Netflix in a special 2-part executive decision segment. When asked about the growth of stock over last 6-7 years, Hastings said that, "It's really the Internet. The Internet is transforming so many sectors of our economy, and we are Internet TV, and that sector has grown from very small 15 years ago to starting to be significant now." He expected the Internet to be a fast growing industry when Netflix started as it allows incredible consumer experience. He also predicts that in the next 10 to 20 years, TV will be all internet. Commenting on the success of original content, he said that it's all about data analytics. "We are just a learning machine. Every time we put out a new show, we are analyzing it, figuring out what worked and what didn't so we get better next time," said Hastings. The stock has also pulled back recently and Cramer asked if this gives investors an opportunity to buy in? "When you get this kind of retreat in the stock, historically as I always tell you, through thick and thin, it's been a terrific buying opportunity. Worst case, it goes lower and you can buy more at even cheaper prices before it rebounds," added Hastings. Cramer posed a question on the worries that hit the street when Disney (NYSE: DIS ) posted a subscriber loss as people were cutting the cord for services like Netflix. "There are a few people that have cut the cord, but it is very, very small still today. But it's a worry about the long term," said Hastings. On expansion, Hastings said that since they have to bid for the content, they are going country by country. The sports networks have been successful in maintaining their audience and ultimately shift to the on-demand model, where consumers will be able to watch any game on any device in the future. Cramer asked Hastings if Netflix is anti-theater, and Hastings said that the company is now the anti-theater and is only a small part of Hollywood, but they believe in offering both choice and convenience to consumers. Money managers who bet on the wrong side of the Fed decision, went liquidating their positions as the Fed did not raise rates. "Remember, some stocks are getting hammered simply because they need to have the Fed raise rates, particularly the financials, which happen to be the largest sector in the S&P 500," said Cramer. He added that Wells Fargo's (NYSE: WFC ) CEO also thinks that rates could remain low longer than expected. Cramer also thinks that the market has a flawed mindset that crude has to go higher for the markets to rally. The reality is that companies benefit from a lower oil price. "I remain convinced that companies with secular growth, meaning growth that is not dependent on a stronger economy, can blossom," said Cramer. He added that investors will be willing to pay for stocks with higher PE multiples as long as the company has consistent growth. Hence Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE ) rallied on Friday on a healthy cloud subscriber growth. Cramer said that investors should not worry about the selloff on Friday as it could have been worse if the Fed had tightened the rates, causing overseas turmoil and hitting home builders and autos. Now, investors should be ready to buy some high-quality stocks at bargain levels on the next leg down, which won't be very deep. CEO interview - Workday (NYSE: WDAY ) Workday is the cloud-based provider of software for human capital management, payroll and financial management. It gives companies applications to automate their back office non-revenue functions. The stock got hammered during the August selloff as analysts were worried about weaker than expected billings guidance. Cramer thinks that the fears are overblown and the stock is $25 off its highs. He interviewed co-CEO Aneel Bhusri to hear about the road map of the company. "I think Wall Street derives too much from calculated billings, because terms change from quarter to quarter. We feel like we are going to have a very strong second half of the year. The pipeline looks strong and customer satisfaction is high," said Bhusri. All the long-term investors want the company to keep taking market share even if it comes at the cost of profit and the company has a goal to reach $1-$3B in revenue. The company reports free cash flow every quarter and is not at risk of running out of money. Bhusri was excited about new financial products as the pipeline has doubled in the last quarter and a lot of Fortune 500 companies are using them. Is it worth buying gold now? Cramer recommended always having some gold in a portfolio and it can be done via owning Gold Trust ETF (NYSEARCA: GLD ). Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ): "China is quite strong for Apple and Tim Cook said the sales were strong. The Chinese consumer is better than the stock market." Rite-Aid (NYSE: RAD ): "People panicked when the company reported. It's giving another chance to get it." BlackRock (NYSE: BLK ): "Nothing is wrong with the stock. Let this one come in and I don't expect the stock to rally in this environment as the rates remain lower." Palo Alto Networks (NYSE: PANW ): "It's in the secular growth area of cyber-security which is a multi-year story." The stock is a great buy for the long term, although it can go down in the short term.
