New Microsoft Becoming Old Microsoft - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft announced a $950 million hit to second quarter earnings. The company is facing the one-year anniversary of Windows 10 and natives are becoming restless. The current valuation of Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) is predicated on the idea that the company has fundamentally changed under CEO Satya Nadella. The reported earnings don't support a price/earnings multiple near 40. Revenue for the March quarter was down $1.2 billion, to $20.5 billion, and net income was down nearly 25%, from $4.9 billion, 61 cents per share, to $3.7 billion or 47 cents. The bullish case for Microsoft is based, in part, on the $7.6 billion in charges taken during the second quarter of 2015, which resulted in a loss for that quarter of $3.2 billion, 40 cents per share. Take that out and the forward P/E comes down to a level below 20. Investors are also focusing on the company's move to cloud, and hope that this "pivot" will mean more subscriptions for products like Office 365, just as the capital costs of the Azure cloud start to fade. But the one-year anniversary of Windows 10 this summer, and a major update to the software, seem certain to strain relations with some long-time users. This will be the first forced hardware upgrade in many years, as the new version requires 2 GB of memory to run. If you believe users are going to remain loyal, you might want to consider buying some Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ ). Microsoft is also running into media criticism over how it is pushing the upgrade, by having users click an "X" that usually means they want to shut a window, interpreting that to mean they accept the upgrade. Microsoft is already building in an excuse for another poor June, laying off 1,850 people who were part of its failed Nokia smartphone business. The restructuring will cost $950 million on this quarter's bottom line . What investors should be focused on, when Microsoft reports earnings on July 19, is the top line. The whisper number is for revenue of $22.2 billion, almost identical to last year's figure, with net income of 59 cents per share. Put another big write-off into that equation and it's hard to see the company meeting those expectations. All this leaves the stock susceptible to a correction, based not just on its own performance but that of the economy as a whole. A downdraft like those in January or last August is going to take Microsoft shares down substantially, into the low 40s, with the fall cushioned by the fact it will raise the yield substantially from its present 2.79%. Should the stock meet expectations it will have no problem with the 36 cent/share dividend but it will have to start delivering major improvements by the third quarter or it could return to its pre-Nadella base line of the 30s.
