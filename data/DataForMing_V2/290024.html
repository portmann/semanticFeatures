How to Ride the Star Wars Wave with Lock-In Stocks and Binary Options - Len Penzo dot Com What do lock-in stocks (like Disney) and binary-options trading have in common? Well, first of all, let’s define our terms. Lock-in stocks, for our purposes, are stocks for companies that can be thought of as too big to fail . Now, of course all companies will fail eventually, in the cosmic sense of time. But as far as your single human life is concerned, there are a few companies around the world that might as well be set in the eternal firmament. Binary options trading can be easy if you know how to pick out these stocks, and it’s not as hard as that might sound. We already mentioned Disney, so let’s talk about Disney. Disney’s stock , due to the Star Wars: The Force Awakens phenomena, is as good a bet as any on this earth, at the moment. Disney bought the rights to Star Wars, and you can be sure they are going to milk them for all they’re worth, which could be quite a lot given that the new Star movie is on track to be the biggest film of all time. This, not to mention the rest of Disney’s near infinite stable of copyright wealth, puts Disney in the enviable position of being one of the largest most valuable corporations in the world. They command more wealth and influence than most nations. It’s safe to say that insofar as the world grows in the next couple of decades, Disney will very likely, at a minimum, grow along with it. This makes them a lock-in stock buy if you’re the sort of investor to buy a stock and sit on it. But their enormous Star Wars momentum makes them great for the binary investor, who uses knowledge of a company’s real world momentum to make informed binary pair investment decisions. If you trade stocks online, you definitely know at least a little about binary options. But most people don’t think of binary investment decisions in terms of their real world influences. At least that’s true of people who aren’t good at binary trading. People who master binary trading investment think about this stuff all the time. It’s very possible to make money trading binary options . The best of the best achieve this by being very conscious about the real world events that influence the values of these options, relative to one another. By correctly making speculations based on perceived momentum of lock-in companies like Disney, investors can be very successful in the binary world.
