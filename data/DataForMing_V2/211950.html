'The Force Awakens' Opens Wallets | Seeking Alpha The newest installment of the Star Wars franchise is breaking records before it even hits the theaters on December 18. Despite encountering a new round of racist backlash on Monday via #BoycottStarWarsVII on Twitter, Star Wars VII: The Force Awakens is dominating the pre-sale box office. The first full trailer for The Force Awakens premiered during an ESPN football game broadcast (ESPN is owned by Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS )), which also owns the Star Wars franchise), and the movie's pre-sale launched at the same time. Alamo Drafthouse, theater chain AMC and Fandango - a Comcast ( CMCSA , CMCSK ) subsidiary - experienced site issues as fans rushed to get their tickets. AMC's pre-sales were 10 times more than the previous record, and Fandango said sales were eight times higher than the first-day pre-sale record set by The Hunger Games in 2012. IMAX Corp. (NYSE: IMAX ) also had a super-record breaking day, with $6.5 million in ticket sales for 390 screens across the US. The Force Awakens isn't just settling for pre-sale box office dominance. Back in June, Morgan Stanley predicted The Force Awakens making $1.95 billion at the global box office, making it the third-highest grossing film of all time behind James Cameron's Titanic and Avatar. Then, in September, Macquarie Securities analyst Tim Nollen wrote that Walt Disney could see $5 billion in first-year sales for Star Wars merchandise. And there's also the Star Wars marathon that will take place in the lead-up to the release of The Force Awakens. The event will take place at Regal Entertainment (NYSE: RGC ) in addition to Alamo Drafthouse and AMC theaters. The Force Awakens is shaping up to be quite a lucrative movie for Disney.
