Disney Kicks Off Summer In Super Way With 'Avengers: Age Of Ultron' Smashing Through Box Office - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha May.  3, 2015  8:52 PM ET  |  About: The Walt Disney Company (DIS) , Includes: FOX , FOXA , TWX by: The Entertainment Oracle Disneyâ€™s â€˜The Avengers: Age Of Ultronâ€™ easily took first place at the box office this weekend with just over $187 million. Despite â€˜Ultronâ€™sâ€™ big opening that total is below what the original â€˜Avengersâ€™ did a few years ago as more outside competition made a larger than expected impact. Marvelâ€™s approach to building its cinematic universe has been stellar and it is going to be hard for DC and Warner Brothers to duplicate with their upcoming films. Disney's (NYSE: DIS ) partnership with Marvel continued to pay off dividends this weekend as the pair's The Avengers: Age of Ultron plowed into theaters and kicked off the summer box office wars. Yet despite the hype, Ultron faced competition from an unexpected source … real-life. First let's breakdown the numbers because they are still mighty impressive and help set up a startling statistic. Ultron earned $187.7 million over three days easily topping the charts and displacing four week reigning champ Furious 7. The superhero ensemble will likely keep the top spot next week as well before facing Warner Brothers' Mad Max reboot and Universal's female friendly Pitch Perfect 2. For now that $187.7 figure is a great way to kick off the summer and is not only double what Sony's The Amazing Spider-Man 2 netted in the slot last year but is actually just about $15 million shy of what Spidey netted over the film's entire domestic run. With the possible exception of Fox's (NASDAQ: FOX ) (NASDAQ: FOXA ) handling of X-Men, it should be very obvious to consumers and investors the only people who know how do a Marvel movie right or those working for Marvel as part of its cinematic universe. Speaking of Fox, the studio is set to unveil its Fantastic Four reboot in August but after seeing Ultron's totals may be a little more unnerved about how already skeptical fans will react. Here's the one thing Fox has working in its favor … Ultron did under-perform so the dollar-to-dollar comparisons will not be as bad as they could have been (though Fantastic likely won't top $100 million opening weekend). Back to Ultron though, yes as weird as is it to say the film and its $187.7 million haul is actually well below projections. Now that's to take nothing away from Disney, Marvel and all involved because it is still amazing total and big win for the studio, its investors and the film industry in general, but early estimates had it breaking the $200 million mark and topping the $207 million opening of its predecessor. So why did it open below those projections? Well as it turns out the only thing that was a bigger threat to The Avengers then Ultron was reality. Between the NBA finals, the Kentucky Derby and the Mayweather-Pacquiao audiences had more interest in actual sporting events than scripted sparring matches; a amazing concept right? Box office returns show a distinct fall stating around Saturday at 5pm which is right around the time the first of those events kicked off … which was not the case when the original Avengers opened a few years ago. Yet Ultron did top the original in the timeframe leading up to that mark, so it shows that die-hard fans were incredibly into the sequel, they just saw the movie earlier. The problem was luring that non die-hard fan base as a larger than expected portion of that group may opt to come out next weekend. Overall though Disney and Marvel now own the top three opening weekends of all time … with The Avengers at #1, Ultron at #2 and fittingly Iron Man 3 at #3. It just goes to show what happens when a studio takes its time and does something like this right and doesn't have to rush it just to stay relevant. Yes, while that was a not so thinly veiled shot at Warner Brothers, I am excited to see how Time Warner's (NYSE: TWX ) version of a cinematic universe works when it launches next year. As a comic book fan I'd love to see DC's super-heroes achieve a similar level of success because they also hold a special place in the hearts of geeks everywhere. Remember, despite the appeal of The Avengers franchise Superman and Batman are arguably bigger and more well-known names and that could translate to big business. While Furious 7 showed you can make a huge box office mark outside of the summer, it will be interesting to see if Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice can come close to the $150 mark, let alone the $180+ mark. Even Marvel's game-changing and massively well-received Captain America: The Winter Solider didn't top $100 million when it came out last year, but again the comparisons are a little different. For now all investors in Disney need to know is that the studio's first of four big tentpoles did the job and with Ant-Man, Inside Out and Tomorrowland still to come, very few studios (with the exception of Universal) have a shot at having a more profitable summer.
