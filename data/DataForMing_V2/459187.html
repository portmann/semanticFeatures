Eddy Cue on Apple's TV plans - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Jul 15 2016, 03:50 ET | About: Apple Inc. (AAPL) | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) won't confirm too many details about its plunge into original content - but media chief Eddy Cue said talent agencies should be "very, very excited" about what it's up to, according to The Hollywood Reporter. The company is "not trying to compete with Netflix," as any efforts around creating TV shows are limited to close integrations with Apple devices and Apple Music, software and services. For instance, the unscripted reality show "Planet of the Apps" lets Apple bring something to the table, but its not actively trying to buy a full-blown Hollywood studio at this point.
