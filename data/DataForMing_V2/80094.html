Xilinx Should Buy AMD - Xilinx, Inc. (NASDAQ:XLNX) | Seeking Alpha Now that Intel bought Altera what is Xilinx going to do? Will Xilinx do business as usual or they will they change their game? Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) is buying Altera (NASDAQ: ALTR ). How does this affect Xilinx (NASDAQ: XLNX ) and what should they do about it? I have to admit that, until 2-3 years ago, I would have said Xilinx would get bought by Intel. After all Xilinx invented the modern FPGA. Xilinx is the market leader. Xilinx owns the university market along with the minds of future FPGA designers and programmers. Xilinx will now face Intel, not Altera in the market place. Both Altera and Xilinx each have around 3,000 people worldwide. Altera and Xilinx have similar business vital statistics with Xilinx having 60% market share to Altera's 40%. It was a duopoly. It won't be any more. Intel has over 100,000 employees. Intel's net income is 5 times more than Xilinx's total revenue and Intel's net income is over 18 times that of Xilinx. Today Intel has 2372 job openings 2/3's of the number of employees that Xilinx has. Intel has the sales force to beat Xilinx everywhere. Intel can drop the margins on Altera FPGAs, without even rattling Wall Street. This allows Intel to undercut Xilinx on deals that they are currently competing with Altera for. Intel is the gorilla in the room and will eventually find Xilinx's lunch and take it. Big companies are slower. Applied innovation is going to be the key if Xilinx is to beat the Intel-Altera machine. While larger companies can innovate, it often takes time to implement that innovation. If Xilinx can do the things that Altera won't do until Intel makes them, then Xilinx can jump out ahead in the $37 billion dollar data server market. Altera will now be forced to directly face the many facets of reconfigurable computing not just making an ASIC replacement. Xilinx has a better configuration fabric than Altera. Xilinx has been doing run time reconfiguration (RTR) for years and has the knowledge and expertise. Without the proper management of the RTR fabric FPGAs are limited to one configuration per program. You need to quickly swap configurations to be competitive in the data center computing world. Intel has other competing products in the data center space. If FPGAs are to replace processors, the fight will be internal to Intel and big company politics will be in play. The internal fight will be to keep the status quo culture of the bigger company. Altera will lose this fight and become slower at adopting change than they have in the past. This will allow Xilinx to move quickly into the greener pastures of big data server market. To be part of the mainstream big data server market is an x86 strategy. While ARMs are becoming popular, x86 had 73% of the server market in 2013. To be a player in the server market will require a mature respected x86 strategy. Xilinx should buy Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) AMD's market cap is only $1.8 billion and Xilinx probably has that much cash in hand. This would let Xilinx get in on the x86 + FPGA fabric tsunami that's about to come. AMD had just released their 6th generation CPU device that incorporated GPU. Xilinx has done the same. AMD and Xilinx have been smashing up different computing architectures and both have expertise in integrating a number of different IP blocks into single architecture. With Intel buying Altera there is a chance that Intel will break Altera management style. There is lots of politics at Intel and many at Intel don't like the idea of FPGA based computing. FPGAs architectures are quickly evolving architectures. CPUs not so much. Intel will slow down Altera's innovation rate. On the other hand if Xilinx buys AMD it's AMD who will have to speed up their innovation rate and that would be good for them. Xilinx could be in charge of its fate and look at this as an opportunity to change before the coming flood or it could just drown in a sea of Intel-Altera blue. Disclosure: The author is long ALTR.
