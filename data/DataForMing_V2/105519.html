UPDATE 2-Truck demand lifts June auto sales in Canada, but not for Ford | Reuters Related: Stocks, Markets, Earnings, Cyclical Consumer Goods TORONTO, July 2 (Reuters) - General Motors, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and Toyota posted higher Canadian sales for June on Thursday, bolstered by healthy demand for their pickup trucks, but Ford's pickup sales fell, hurting its monthly results. Ford said its Canadian sales fell 13 percent to 26,784 vehicles, with truck sales dropping 11 percent and car sales diving 19 percent. Fiat Chrysler said its sales in Canada notched a 1 percent rise to 27,217 vehicles as Dodge and Chrysler minivan sales rose 14 percent to 6,186. The company's Windsor, Ontario, van plant reopened in late May after a retooling. Its three-month closure had reduced supplies of some of the Canadian unit's top-selling vehicles. Ram brand truck sales climbed 13 percent to 9,081, while Chrysler truck sales popped 164 percent higher to 1,863, offsetting an 8 percent drop in Dodge truck sales to 6,580 vehicles. GM Canada said a 15 percent lift in June sales came from gains across its Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac brands. Total sales for Cadillac and Chevrolet brands rose 13 percent, while GMC sales increased 18 percent and Buick sales jumped 29 percent, the company said. Toyota said its Canadian sales rose 10.5 percent to 20,689 vehicles as truck sales climbed 19 percent to a record 10,750 vehicles. Overall sales for the first half of the year were up 4.3 percent from the year-before period to 104,977 vehicles. In the United States, June auto industry sales rose to about 1.47 million vehicles, up 3.9 percent from a year earlier, according to figures compiled by WardsAuto. U.S. demand for sport utility vehicles and trucks helped GM and Ford offset slowing demand for sedans as it allowed them to raise truck and SUV prices.
