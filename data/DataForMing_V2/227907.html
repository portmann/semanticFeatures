UAW says General Motors workers vote in favor of U.S. labor contract | Reuters Related: Stocks, Markets, Cyclical Consumer Goods DETROITA majority of United Auto Workers members voted in favor of a new four-year contract with General Motors Co, but the pact is not yet ratified because skilled trades workers voted it down, the U.S. union said on Friday night. Overall, 55.4 percent of GM's UAW workers voted to approve the contract. Production workers voted 58 percent for the deal and skilled trades workers, who are fewer in number, voted 59.5 percent to reject it. Over the next several days, UAW leaders will meet with skilled trades workers at each work site to determine their reasons for rejecting the deal, a union statement said. Then, the UAW's executive board will meet to determine the next steps. But any changes to the national contract can only affect skilled trades workers, the UAW said. Earlier on Friday, the union and Ford Motor Co  announced that a tentative agreement had been reached for Ford's 52,700 UAW members at Ford. The Ford pact will go to worker ratification vote as early as next week.
