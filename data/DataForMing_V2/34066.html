That's $2127 month.  Income Tax deductions take a bit of the sting out of that number. I have more house than I need but I sure do like the large amount of space, location, etc.  Only way I could think of lowering my cost is to take on a roommate and I don't think I want to do that. The good news is that, in the 4 years I've owned the house, it has appreciated close to $400k in value. The terrible rising cost of groceries is my biggest monthly expense! I use coupons and shop on sale, but still if I want to cook healthy it costs a lot of money! My biggest monthly expense is rent and it takes up 50% of my income but there's no way to lower it.
