United to buy 40 Boeing jets in blow to Bombardier CSeries | Reuters Jan 21 United Airlines said on Thursday it will buy 40 single-aisle jets from Boeing Co in a blow to smaller rival Bombardier Inc, which has sought a major customer to give momentum to its CSeries jet after years of delays and cash problems. United, the second largest U.S. airline by capacity, said   the Boeing 737-700 aircraft will enter its fleet beginning in mid-2017, for flights it currently contracts to regional partners. Reuters reported last week that Boeing appeared well placed to snatch at least part of a deal for 30 small jets from United, worth around $2 billion at list prices.
