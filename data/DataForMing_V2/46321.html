Things Have Become A Lot More Complicated On Wall Street | Seeking Alpha Explains why I bought Apple and MasterCard this week. Talks about why things are so complicated now for the investor. Explains the theory of "no brainer" investing. Talks about what may happen going forward to the markets and commodities like gold. The U.S. markets performance this past week has followed a similar pattern to what we as investors have been witnessing since December 5, 2014, and that is of a roller coaster from hell. Since that date the bulls and bears have been fighting it out tooth and nail and so far neither has come out a winner. The U.S. government just made things a lot more complicated on Wall Street as on Wednesday it reported that first quarter gross domestic product grew at a lower-than-expected 0.2 percent. In comparison GDP grew 2.2 percent in the fourth quarter and 5 percent in the third quarter of 2014. Consumer spending, which is 70% of our economy and is the main engine of economic growth, slowed sharply to 1.9%, below the average 2.3% increase since the recovery began in mid-2009. In that report it also showed that business investment in "structures" such as mining shafts and wells sank 23.1% in the first quarter, reflecting lower spending by U.S. energy companies seeking to cope with suddenly cheap oil and that exports tumbled 7.2% while imports edged up 1.8%. A bigger trade deficit subtracts from GDP. This serious drop in the growth of GDP has spawned many theories as to what the Federal Reserve will do with regard to interest rates going forward. It is my belief that the Federal Reserve is now trapped in a corner and that it will not be able to raise interest rates until at least 2016. I say this because if it does raise rates then the U.S. dollar will continue its spike up and continue to cause havoc to the commodities sector as well as hurt the revenue growth of U.S. multinationals. Goldcorp (NYSE: GG ), for example, caused a bit of a panic this week in the gold pits and brought on strong selling in gold as the company reported: "Goldcorp Inc, the world's biggest gold producer by market value, reported weaker earnings on Thursday that fell well short of analyst expectations, as lower prices along with higher taxes and costs more than offset increased production from its mines. Goldcorp shares fell 5.8 percent in Toronto after the results were announced, amid deep market declines for gold miners." So what does this news mean for gold? Gold, which early in 2015 spiked up to $1,300 an ounce, is now at $1,173 and if it drops to below $1,150, it will break through its 2014 low. If it does that then we need to go back to 2010 in the chart below, at $990 an ounce, before we find the next resistance point. So gold is about $83 an ounce away from having some serious problems, if it breaks through those two key resistance points. The reason that this is happening can probably be attributed to a zero threat of inflation anytime soon and a greater risk of deflation. Since gold (NYSEARCA: GLD ) and silver (NYSEARCA: SLV ) do great as a hedge against inflation, both commodities are tanking because the exact opposite is true. With the latest terrible GDP result released this week, it did not inspire much confidence in those trading gold and silver. Currently 40%-plus of the world is experiencing deflation as the chart below shows. To say that this is amazing is an understatement and you can read more about this phenomenon by going to my article published on Seeking Alpha called Bond Investors Beware, History Is Not On Your Side , where you will read about European government bond yields being at multi-century lows. All this has caused me to keep my clients at an 80% cash position as many earnings reports coming out this quarter have just been terrible, with forward guidance not being much better. Last night, for example, LinkedIn (NYSE: LNKD ), which benefits greatly from a strong jobs market, tanked after they reported terrible results and guided lower as SA Senior Editor Eric Jhonsa reported LinkedIn -23.9%; weak guidance blamed on forex, ads, job services, Lynda.com It makes you wonder how accurate the unemployment data the government is presenting when a company like LinkedIn is suffering so badly? Despite the great risk of deflation and the currency headwinds that have plagued the markets I was able to buy two stocks this week which I have classified as no-brainers. The first was MasterCard (NYSE: MA ), which reported these results this week: Worldwide purchase volume was up 12% to $783B. These results were excellent but the real reason I bought the stock was because on April 22, 2015 the Chinese government announced that they will allow foreign firms to operate bank card processing operations in China through local partnerships or acquisitions starting on June 1, 2015. This is a long term play for me as I see this as a tremendous opportunity. I'm waiting on adding Visa (NYSE: V ) though as I was not impressed with the company's latest report and since both of these firms will probably need a year or two to get operations running in China. I'm in no rush. The second "no brainer" opportunity I was able to pick up this week is Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). The company basically forced my hand in having me buy its shares, as it had a wonderful quarter, despite serious forex headwinds. Apple also announced the following news that amazed me: "The firm also announced Monday that it would expand its capital return program to $200 billion from a previously announced $130 billion. This estimated figure comes from Apple increasing its share repurchase authorization to $140 billion from the $90 billion announced last year, and boosting its dividend 11 percent to 52 cents per share. The planned program goes through March of 2017, Apple said. CEO Tim Cook said on the firm's earnings call that the buyback reflects "our strong confidence in what lies ahead for Apple." The tech giant said its cash horde had risen to a record $193.5 billion - over $171 billion of which was located offshore. Last quarter the total cash figure came in at $178 billion, according to the company." $200 billion in capital return to shareholders is just an insane figure and despite my concern about the company's $737 billion market capitalization and its temporary glitches with the Apple Watch , the massive capital return to shareholders more than trumps these concerns by a wide margin. I further analyzed Apple in this Seeking Alpha article for those interested: How To Use Levered Free Cash Flow And Revenue Growth To Analyze Stocks . Going forward, my job as an analyst, portfolio manager and fiduciary for my clients has never been more difficult as central bankers throughout the world continue to artificially stimulate world markets through various quantitative easing programs. These programs in turn are causing the yields on government bonds to go negative in many cases. This is a serious warning sign to investors as negative yields basically mean that you as an investor are paying the government interest to hold your money for you, instead of getting interest from the government. That to me is the pinnacle of folly and madness and tells me that the principal on those government bonds is in great jeopardy and someday the losses that may rack up could be quite large and unprecedented, as history is telling us that most government bonds are now selling at historic highs in principal and historic lows in yield. When the bond market eventually blows up as it must, what will happen to the global stock markets as a result? Will panic selling in bonds lead to panic selling in stocks? That in the end is why things on Wall Street have gotten a lot more complicated right now. As for me I will only be investing in companies that I deem to be "no brainers" as I explained above with my Apple and MasterCard examples. For me to buy something going forward, not only do the numbers (that a company puts up) have to be great, but I also need to see an overwhelming catalyst ("no brainer") and story to go along with it. In my opinion, global stock markets are overvalued right now (based on growth rates) but bond markets are twice as overvalued (based on the great threat of deflation encompassing the world). I see the future quite clearly and it is not going to be pretty, but unfortunately since markets are not allowed to operate these days without the artificial stimulus from central bankers, I just can't tell you the exact date on when the global house of cards or domino's will finally fall, as no one can. The stock market could be entering a 1998 style "dotcom boom and bust" market scenario. If this is true then the bull may have more room to run, but then will only become more overvalued as it did in 2000-2001 and we all know what happened next.
