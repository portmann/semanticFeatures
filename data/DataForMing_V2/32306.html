Apple Could And Should Diversify To The Renewable Energy Business - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple and SunPower will be co-owners of two 20-MW solar energy farms in China. China is emerging as a huge and fast-growing market for solar energy. Tim Cook is a dedicated activist for addressing the climate change problem. Cook made it clear last year that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) will continue to invest in sustainable energy. Apple, as long as Cook is in charge, does not care about Return on Investment (ROI) over the company's spending on clean energy facilities. Cook angrily suggested last year that shareholders who care too much about ROI over renewable energy expenses should ditch their shares. I opine that Apple's boss might be open to expansion to the renewable energy business. My thesis is supported by Apple's recent team up with SunPower (NASDAQ: SPWR ) to build and operate two 20-Megawatt solar energy facilities in China. The joint venture between Apple and SunPower is a commercial undertaking that will provide electricity to homes in the ABA Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefectures in Sichuan, China. Apple also hired SunPower in 2012 to build its 20-megawatt solar farm for its data centers in North Carolina. However, I believe Apple should not only build solar farms for its data centers or for its own use. Apple's shareholders would appreciate it very much if the company expands toward for-profit renewable energy investments. I am not saying that Apple should buy SunPower. But most shareholders will find Cook's spending on renewable energy more palatable if SunPower and Apple build more commercial venture solar farms in China and Asia. Cook's fondness toward clean energy sources (as a means to cure the climate change problem) could be a viable diversification product/service to lessen Apple's reliance on iPhone sales. Monetizing China's huge market should not be limited to selling iPhones and iPads. China is emerging as a giant in solar power energy. Apple, with its vast cash reserves, can help SunPower become a key player in China's fast-growing renewable energy industry. China's solar power capacity posted a 60% growth in 2014 to 28 Gigawatt. But that is only 2.1% of China's total power capacity of 1,360 Gigawatts. The two upcoming 20-megawatt Apple/SunPower solar farms in China is just a small drop in a giant bucket. China aims to add another 15 Gigawatt of solar power capacity this year. China aims to make non-fossil fuel energy sources deliver 15% of its total energy need by 2020. Apple and SunPower could have long-term benefits if they make a serious play for China's fast-growing solar power industry. Morgan Stanley made it clear last year that China is going to be the biggest growth driver for the solar energy business. China's position as the world's biggest manufacturer of goods means it will continue to see a strong surge in electricity requirements. It would please Cook if the next versions of iPhones and iPads from Foxconn's Chinese factories are manufactured using solar energy. The Global Solar PV Industry Is Huge It is impossible for me now to guesstimate the economic benefits of Apple getting serious in solar or renewable energy. The company makes too much money from selling iPhones but there will come a time when this gold mine will not be as profitable as it is right now. The high-margin policy on iPhones will not endure forever. Cheaper premium Android and Windows phones will pressure Apple to eventually lower the price tags of its future iPhones. I am therefore hoping that the close relationship with SunPower and Cook's fondness for renewable energy would inspire Apple to gamble on solar, wind, and other non-fossil fuel energy business. I believe Apple could do better on renewable energy rather than gambling on electric vehicles. The low price of oil means ordinary consumers will continue to buy more diesel and premium gas-powered cars. There might be a bigger opportunity in providing factories and residential homes with renewable energy. The solar photovoltaic industry alone is slated to grow in to a market worth more than $140 billion annually. It might not be profitable for Apple now to go heavy on solar energy services. However, as solar panels get cheaper and more efficient, a renewable energy gamble could end up a big winner in the future. Cook is young and strong. He will reign at Apple for a long time. I hope that Apple would be one of the biggest firms helping reduce the planet's consumption of toxic fossil fuels. Coal is cheap. Oil is cheap. Nuclear power is very cheap. However, health is wealth. Renewable energy like those from solar farms are more healthy to people and the environment. The health-tracking feature of the new Apple Watch is best optimized when users are not breathing the toxic fumes of coal-powered power plants. Siemens also says there is a great opportunity in renewable energy. China is not the only market for solar and wind energy farms. Siemens predict that by 2030 renewable energy sources will have a bigger share than nuclear power in the global electricity generation. Even the Philippines is aggressively investing in renewable energy. My province, Ilocos Norte, has a 4.1 Megawatt solar farm and 150-Megawatt wind power facility. Unfortunately, the renewable energy industry here is a laggard compared to China. Apple and SunPower could also help lower the carbon footprint of power plants in the Philippines. The Wall Street Journal has warned that the Philippines is in energy crisis . It might be the reason why my country has the most expensive electricity in Asia and fifth-most expensive kilowatt per hour electricity rate in the world. The experts have declared solar as the best solution to the Philippines continuing short supply in electricity. Apple's money and SunPower's expertise could help put up a network of small and medium scale solar farms in the Philippines and other Asian countries.
