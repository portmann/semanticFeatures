Though McDonald’s and Subway have been able to accept Android Pay — Google’s answer to the iPhone’s Apple Pay digital payment platform — for weeks, the actual app has yet to become available for the millions of Android device owners who might want to try it. The company is now finally confirming that Android Pay is rolling out in the coming days. “Weâ€™ll be rolling out gradually over the next few days, and this is just the beginning,” a Google exec tells Bloomberg . “We will continue to add even more features, banks and store locations in the coming months, making it even easier to pay with your Android phone.” Google has long offered its Google Wallet payment service that allows users to make payments with certain vendors using stored payment card information. The company now says Wallet will pivot to focus more on allowing users to send and receive funds, while Android Pay will be used for the making of purchases. In addition to the two fast food giants mentioned above, a number of major retailers have already agreed to accept Android Pay, including Macy’s, Meijer, BJ’s, Petco, Foot Locker, Staples, Whole Foods, Walgreens, GameStop, Panera. UPDATE: Staples has confirmed that it will begin accepting Android Pay on Sept. 16. â€œStaples knows that todayâ€™s small business customers rely on their phones more than ever to make purchases and save time,â€? said Alison Corcoran, a senior vice president for the retailer, in a statement. â€œWith Android Pay, shoppers can quickly and securely pay for their products, so they can focus on making more happen for their business.â€?
