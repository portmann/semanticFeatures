Yahoo to cut 15% of workforce as part of strategic plan - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha Feb  2 2016, 16:44 ET | By: Stephen Alpher , SA News Editor The company through its plan hopes to get to an adjusted EBITDA run rate of roughly $1B by H2 of this year. Operating expenses are to be cut by $400M by year-end. Asset sales are hoped to raise more than $1B in cash. Revenue in Mavens (mobile, video, native, and social) is hoped to reach $1.8B this year. In consumer products, the company will consist of three global platforms: Search, Mail, and Tumblr, and four verticals: News, Sports, Finance, and Lifestyle. For advertisers, Yahoo will be defined by two core offerings: Gemini and BrightRoll. As for search, it's all about mobile, and the company will shift most of its resources in this area to more "forward-leaning" mobile search investments. Along with job cuts of 15%, the company will exit five offices in Dubai, Mexico City, Buenos Aires, Madrid, and Milan. Most of these changes will take place in Q1, and Yahoo will have about 9K employees by year-end, and less than 1K contractors.
