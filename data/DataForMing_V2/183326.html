Apple: Mapping-Focused Acquisitions, iBeacon And Kylie Jenner - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple recently acquired Mapsense, a mapping data and analytics startup. Apple spent an estimated ~$30 million to close the deal. This isn't the first and likely won't be the last mapping-based/mapping-focused acquisition by Apple - but are these acquisitions for mapping tech or something else? I argue that Apple is really trying to aggregate tech and capacity that it can use to build out its iBeacon abilities. I ask Bill Clark, Beacon-tech expert and CEO of Beacon-focused company Spindle, for his thoughts on the subject as well as how he views the new "content portal normal." Don't overlook the recent acquisition by Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) of Mapsense. I think this acquisition and the handful of what appear to be mapping-based/mapping-focused acquisitions prior to it are bread crumbs that lead down a more lucrative, stickier and higher value-prop enhancing trail than the one that's currently consensus. Stating it plainly, I disagree with the idea that Apple is out spending an estimated $30 million on Mapsense (and countless other millions on its collective mapping/mapping tech additions) to be able to get Apple product users closest to the pin. Frankly I think Apple could care less about mapping per se. This becomes especially true when considering the massive incumbent advantage that competitor Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) has in servicing this need and the currently limited monetization endpoints of mapping. I say that very delicately with the understanding that this space is rapidly evolving. I think what Apple really wants out of the ability to accurately plot and direct users is to build out the next great mobile engagement system in tech. I think that iBeacon is about to become a serious focus for Apple. Why do I think this is the real direction Apple plans on deploying the mapping tech it has acquired - towards iBeacon? Because the narrative just makes more sense this way. Think about it. Why does Apple want to be in the business of content distribution? Hasn't it always been? Isn't it already? Isn't that what Apple devices are, a better way for all of us get the content we desire? Isn't that what the app store and iTunes are - content delivery portals to other content delivery mechanisms? I think so. I think the answer to all of the above is yes. Think seriously about the fact that the most downloaded app on the planet since its launch (a very recently launched celebrity based app from Kylie Jenner) has an incremental monthly subscription charge associated with it. Wait, celebrity/entertainment driven and has a charge associated? Sound familiar? Does this application sound at all like the foundation and contributing force for how Apple turned the music industry into its own licensed, collective quasi-subscription service via iTunes in the early shaping of that industry's digital transition? The recent boom of celebrity/influencer based apps are just content portals to original content, as are all apps to their content, as was iTunes for musician content. Apple happens to have a retina-faced, superchip powered way of viewing this content. If Apple can drive a value prop to content, whether that be from a reactionary or proactive standpoint (maybe even data and analytics assisted - Mapsense helps with this) the population has shown it's more than willing to go get it- even if it has to pay. But what happens if the population is paid in the form of discounts to receive content? What if that content was sent to the population by the same content providers (read: the app celebrity) that the population is following? How much more effective is a recommendation for a clothing item being delivered via the Kylie Jenner app via Kylie Jenner "herself" rather than an email from the company? Data has shown it's much more powerful and closes at a higher rate. Apple, at least I believe, understands this and also understands that sales data shows that if a recommendation by a celebrity/influencer/app creator (say Kylie Jenner) can be made when the individual is close to the "pin" (read: the item being recommended is done so while the app subscriber is shopping) that the value-prop and effectiveness of the advertisement grows. Doesn't it make sense for Apple to sign Kylie Jenner (or whomever) to an exclusivity deal tethered to iBeacon? I think it does. I think it makes perfect sense for Apple to lock in the total content ecosystem for content portals it's helping proliferate - just like it has done with iTunes and with its App store. Even if Apple doesn't want/isn't able to get exclusivity - doesn't it still make sense to be a player at the table? Again, I think it does. With Apple's revamp of Newsstand to News at WWDC15 Apple has gone all in on overt content delivery. It understands that with the secular move away from the ability to bombard mobile (and general online) users with ads, largely thanks to Apple itself, that the ability to market to the broader population is going to be harder to do and more inbound-focused than ever. That in itself should make being able to successfully do this more lucrative than ever. I think Apple realizes it can get ahead of this tech with its iBeacon and that it can build a sticky monetization chain on top of the new content providers in the same way it did this with the music industry with iTunes and the app industry with its app store. Heck, it's even trying to do this with payments via its payment system. Apple is really, really good at building monetization chains on top of massive, existing or even new monetization chains - if that makes sense. And maybe this was the plan all along - to build out iBeacon via semi-covert acquisitions. Or at least dating back whatever distance it took Apple to come to the sudden conclusion that a better Newsstand was necessary (with no apparent immediate value add to the holistic Apple platform or apparent reason to make this a focus of WWDC15) and that paying up for mapping tech was the thing to do. I also don't believe that this confluence of seemingly content delivery focused innovation and evolution coinciding with Apple now overtly trying to convert "telecom customer" to "Apple-direct customer" is without serious planning and analysis. I mean, I guess it all could be coincidence but I just don't think it is. Apple is wanting total capture of its device user base - from selling devices to servicing devices. It's also wanting total revenue ecosystem deployment on top of its device user base - this means including its iBeacon tech as well to capture the monetization of that precious engagement at that precious moment of timing. I think in the near term it could mean being led by the iBeacon tech. Yes, that's right - led by iBeacon. I think that as we move toward a more inbound-focused advertising model and a more "requested-content" delivery model that Beacon triggered advertising is going to be one that takes off in a big, big way. As we move toward a user experience that centers on one that has users downloading Kylie Jenner's app - for instance, users paying to have access to content, and users very closely tying themselves to more app driven, portal delivered content, that beacon is going to be another iTunes/App Store type system on a greater system of monetization for Apple. I reached out to Scottsdale-based startup Spindle, Inc. (OTCQB: SPDL ) CEO Bill Clark, a friend of mine in the beacon/content marketing space and somebody I consider an expert on the space/tech/movement for some closing thoughts on Apple, its presence in the Beacon space, and exactly how big Beacon can get as a result of the secular move to app-driven content. Spindle's entire business model is built on exactly what Apple is trying to do, or at least what I believe it's trying to do, so I figured if anybody would have a qualified comment it would be Bill - his thoughts are below: "As Apple matures its presence in this market, with the acquisition of technology and advertising content to deliver direct user engagement, they along with others in the content marketing space (like Spindle) who have the connection to these technologies will change the nature of marketing for good. What was once a push-out model in traditional mobile marketing becomes a pull-in model when the mobile shopper is consuming content. I don't think most investors or consumers for that matter fully understand how big that is and what that's going to mean in the longer term. This is, as you know, the biggest reason Spindle has been so aggressive in building out our Spindle platform with the Yowza acquisition almost two years ago now. Obviously this is a significant change in the overall engagement cycle and a significant change in the value-prop of the advertising and consumption cycle, which is the constant dance that takes place between advertiser and prospect customer. Customers viewing location specific promotions, coupons, and delivery of other product material while interacting with their retailer - for instance, being driven by "receiving a recommendation from Kylie Jenner" or whatever content the customer is already consuming will lead to rapid and large scale acceptance of the norm of paying for services on the fly with their (the customers) integrated mobile payment platform. This too will be inclusive of earning loyalty points and in general fully engaging in-store, online, and in real-time during their shopping experience. Not only is this a more monetizable customer for the monetization endpoint (the retailer or whomever) but Spindle data agrees with broader industry data that this is a more loyal and greater brand net promoter customer. That's exactly why, if it plays out that Apple wants into the space bad enough to build out its platform by acquisitions, Apple might be taking such an aggressive posture to the space. Apple wants to be front and center to the next monetization revolution for the customer. So do we."
