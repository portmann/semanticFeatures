Apple Earnings Preview: When Will The Music Stop? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha AAPL will report earnings on Tuesday. Consensus expects $1.88 in EPS, $51b in revenue and 47m in iPhone sales. Bigger question lies in the guidance. Flat iPhone shipments would actually be a positive for the stock given the already low expectations. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) will report on Tuesday after close with consensus expecting $1.88 in EPS ad $51b in revenue. The stock has been down -9% since its last quarterly results as the market is concerned about the maturity of iPhone growth and demand given the prolonged upgrade cycle (see - Apple: Fundamental Story Taking A Turn? ). I see the shift in the smartphone distribution model among the carriers from subsidy to EIP/leasing pushing out the iPhone upgrade cycle and affecting its demand (see - Apple: Shift In Handset Distribution Model A Negative For iPhone Adoption ). Additionally, potential competitive pressure is ramping up, particularly in China, where local OEMs are increasingly bridging their gap with the iPhone. As for non-iPhone hardware metrics, it is unusual to see how analysts are not focusing on the Apple Watch, which many have written off as a non-focus product. With the Watch not gaining much traction, iPad sales continuing to decline and Mac sales seeing signs of slippage, Apple remains a one-product company that centers around the iPhone, which at the end of the day is a commoditized item. Perhaps the most important metrics AAPL will provide are its App Store sales, which continue to be the foundation for AAPL's ecosystem growth. With the introduction of Apple Music on Android devices, it is clear that non-iPhone revenue from App Store and mobile payments are becoming increasingly important to offset the inevitable decline in hardware. In the near-term, I expect fund flows from value investors will continue to support the shares, but there is less support for the long-term prospect of the stock, in my view. I remain bearish on AAPL. Consensus expects 48m iPhone shipments with consensus estimates fairly tight this quarter ranging from 47m to 50m. Anything short of 47m would likely to be a negative to the stock and reinforce the bearish views that the change in the smartphone distribution model is taking a toll on iPhone demand. For this quarter, I expect momentum to be intact given the already low expectations and potential higher sales from Asia to offset the weakness in iPad. The key question investors should ask is how will the December quarter compare relative to that of last year with iPhone 6 sales (see - Apple: The Challenged Ecosystem )? Current investor sentiment (based on my conversation with large fund managers) suggests that their expectations are below Wall Street iPhone numbers for December. Currently they are looking for 75m iPhones for next quarter. Assuming AAPL hits this number, it would imply that iPhone growth would be flat at best. That would actually be a positive for investor sentiment. Last week's Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) and AT&T (NYSE: T ) read-through was quite telling and implies that volume could be weak. Notably, Verizon expects lower smartphone volume versus last year due to the iPhone 6 launch. While AT&T did not guide on smartphone demand, they did note that 71% of the new plans are on installment plans. I note that installment plans actually favor lower cost handsets as consumers look to lower their monthly bill, so much of the demand may not be driven by the iPhone, which is consistent with the trend we saw in Verizon. My bearish view on the iPhone is well documented, but I am positive on the App Store because it is the most attractive part of the company with solid revenue growth and a high margin profile at approximately 80%. Despite that gaming apps remain the cash cow, I expect productivity apps in health, corporate and financial services to be the future drivers for the iOS ecosystem. Heading into the result, I will pay particular attention to software sales as I see this as perhaps the only sustainable revenue and margin source for AAPL (see - Apple: Unbundling To Drive Ecosystem Penetration ). I remain bearish on AAPL given the higher comps and expectations on the iPhone. Hardware can be easily commoditized and iPhone core sales and margins are unsustainable in the long-term. Novelty effect could keep the momentum intact in the near-term, but it is likely to wear out. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
