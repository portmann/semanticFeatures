More Proof That AWS Will Struggle In Amazon.com's Earnings Report Tomorrow - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Q2 is seasonally weak for cloud-delivered-as-a-service, or has been the last two years. Analysts have upped price targets and earnings estimates ahead of the quarter for AWS and Amazon.com. If you haven't been following the cloud infrastructure services space over the last couple years, then you probably don't know that it's an industry growing at 50% annually with $17 billion in trailing 12-month revenue. You're probably unaware that Amazon.com's (NASDAQ: AMZN ) AWS controls nearly 30% of this market and that Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) has been the fastest growing player in the space, increasing its market share from 7% to 10% over the last year with triple-digit growth. Regardless, Amazon.com is the industry's king of the hill, adding over $45 billion in market capitalization since the first quarter in large part because of AWS's unexpected revenue growth and profitability. However, as I explained in a recent article, AWS might very well disappoint in a seasonally weak second quarter . In addition to the reasons I note in that article, Microsoft provided yet a few more reasons to be wary ahead of Amazon.com's second quarter report tomorrow. As previously said, Amazon.com owns more market share in cloud-as-a-service, but Microsoft is growing much faster. During the first quarter, Synergy Research figures that AWS grew 49% whereas Microsoft's revenue nearly doubled in cloud infrastructure services. As for Microsoft, it doesn't report a lot of specific details about assets tracked by Synergy Research. Instead, Microsoft provides year-over-year growth rates and run rates for its Commercial Cloud, which pretty much consists of Azure, Office 365 and Dynamics CRM. For that segment, Microsoft reported revenue growth of just 88% during its last quarter. While 88% revenue growth is impressive, it represents a significant slowdown from the first calendar quarter's 106% growth, in Microsoft's Commercial Cloud segment. What Microsoft showed is what I already suggested in that last Amazon.com article: The second quarter has proven to be relatively weak for cloud service providers vs. a strong first quarter. Not only did Microsoft's Commercial Cloud grow 106% in the first quarter, but in 2014 it grew 154% in the same period. For Amazon.com's AWS, Microsoft's Commercial Cloud, IBM, etc., cloud delivered as a service growth tends to slow in the second quarter. Microsoft just proved it ahead of Amazon.com's quarterly report. With all things considered, this is just an observation, something to think about. I'm only noting this observation because of the enormous risk that's baked into Amazon.com's stock. Seriously, the company added $45 billion in market capitalization without an exceptional quarter from its core e-commerce business or media segment. As I suggested back in April, most if not all of Amazon.com's post-earnings gains and short-term gains were immediately tied to AWS . As a result, if the second quarter reflects the slowdown that I expect, and analysts have been doing nothing except upping earnings estimates and price targets, then AMZN could be poised for rather substantial stock losses. Therefore, if you are bullish on Amazon.com and AWS long term, like I am, it might be good to take some profits, cut the position, and maybe buy back later. In retrospect, it's never a bad idea to take a profit.
