Apple Pay Now Accepts All Major Credit Cards After Finally Adding Discover – Consumerist Apple Pay now supports all major U.S. credit card companies, after Discover and the payment system finally reached a deal. The New York Times reports the two companies reached an agreement that will let Discover cardholders make purchases at participating retailers by using the Apple Pay system on the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus or Apple Watch. Apple Pay currently has deals in place with the other three major U.S. credit card issuers – Visa, MasterCard and American Express – as well as, several large banks. The mobile payment system allows consumers to scan and verify credit cards into the Passbook of their device so they can use those accounts without ever providing participating businesses with their card numbers. Starting this fall, the Times reports, Discover users will be able to pay for goods within certain apps through Apple Pay on the iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3.
