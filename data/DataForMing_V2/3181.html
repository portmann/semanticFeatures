ETF Hub Mar 13 2015, 18:26 ET | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor A third Anaheim park is likely out for Disney (NYSE: DIS ), but expanding Disneyland is still likely, CEO Robert Iger told shareholders. Meantime, Iger confirmed (via an inadvertent answer to a child questioner) that Hollywood Studios, at Walt Disney World in Florida, would be changing names again . It used to be MGM Studios. There's a very good chance, then, that either (or both) of the expanded Disneyland and new Hollywood Studios will be set around Disney's high-profile recent branding efforts: Marvel and/or Star Wars.
