Verizon: Stagnant For The Near Future - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha Wireless segment is likely to grow at slower pace compared to previous years. Sale of non-core assets to raise capital creates short-term headwind for recurring earnings. Wireline segment is on a slow declining trajectory. These factors and the need to deleverage will lead to near-term financial strain. Last year, Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) completed its mammoth buyout of Verizon Wireless for $130B. They also inked a multi-year, $1B deal for NFL streaming rights. This year, they raised $15B by selling non-core assets, and acquired AOL for $4.4B. These key developments give us strong clues as to management's strategies and the company's prospects for the next few years. We believe although the business remains healthy, Verizon's earnings and free cash flow growth will slow as they transition to become a one-stop platform from the traditional carrier model while simultaneously deleveraging their pile of debt. This plan will take time to bear fruit and inevitably create a financial strain in the short term. Hence, Verizon's profitability and overall growth is likely to be stagnant in the next few years. While other carriers have descended into a price war, Verizon has managed to stay above the fray, in large part due to its superior network quality and coverage. Despite having the costliest plans among the four telcos, they've continued to enjoy the lowest average churn in the industry. Essentially, Verizon can afford to wait it out given its dominant position as the largest carrier with the overall best network. Management seems to have the view that the price war in its current state is unsustainable given the toll it is taking on the other carriers' profitability. Given that Sprint is facing severe financial troubles and T-Mobile's subscriber growth is still not translating to significant earnings growth, it is likely that Verizon's management will continue to wait it out. However, growth in postpaid handset subscriptions have slowed considerably compared to earlier years, signally flattening handset growth. Since then, tablet connections have accounted for the majority of postpaid subscriber adds, leading to lower margins. We deduce that Verizon's strategy going forward is to maintain their premium pricing at the expense of lower postpaid subscriber growth. Simultaneously, the company is trying to monetize the existing base of subscribers by encouraging them to add more connections and devices, such as migrating more subscribers to high-speed 4G data plans and adding tablet and other device connections ( Verizon Vehicle ). This shift in strategy was marked by a change in accounting - Verizon stopped measuring performance by Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) and started reporting Average Revenue Per Accounts (ARPA) instead to reflect the transition from a user-based to platform-based business model. The charts indicate Verizon has been executing well as they've consistently increased the connections per account and have continued to add postpaid accounts at a healthy rate. (Note: ARPA fell significantly in 2014Q4 and 2015Q1 due to the greater adoption of Verizon Edge, which meant more revenue was shifted from service revenue to equipment revenue, and the timing of revenue recognition was deferred due to the nature of the plans as more customers chose to pay for their phones in installment.) While this strategy may be beneficial in the long run with the proliferation of connected devices, it is likely to result in diminished bottom line growth for the foreseeable future. Verizon's postpaid handset growth has slowed significantly due to the wireless wars, and being a mature company with a large subscriber base, it's harder to maintain the same growth percentages as the past. Also, while connected devices are quickly gaining steam, they are still only a small portion of Verizon's massive operation that will probably not become financially meaningful in the next five years. Even though adoption of new technology offerings such as Verizon Vehicle will grow at a tremendous pace, it is still far from contributing significantly to earnings and free cash flow. In essence, although free cash flow and earnings will continue to support a growing dividend, growth is unlikely to be significant in the next few years. Barring any macro surprises, we expect the share price to reflect this trend. Another vein of strategy that management is pursuing is to raise funds by selling peripheral assets. For the next few years, Verizon's capital spending requirements will remain extremely high with the FCC's spectrum auction happening in 2016 and the commitment to deleveraging the company's debt. Furthermore, more CAPEX spending is expected as the company invests in video and advertising offerings, as seen in their recent acquisition of AOL and the deal for NFL streaming rights. Verizon's strategy of selling peripheral assets such as copper wirelines and FiOS assets is prudent given these circumstances. The recent $15B deal with AmericanTower (NYSE: AMT ) and Frontier (NASDAQ: FTR ) indicated that more of these deals should be expected as Verizon hopes to get rid of all their copper wirelines as they transition subscribers to fiber services. However, the immediate short-term impact would be the loss of cash flow and earnings from these assets, which will negatively impact the bottom line whereas CAPEX spending on more spectrum, network upgrades and integrating new offerings will only provide returns over a longer time. Therefore, as Verizon continues to divest non-core assets over the next few years in order to focus on growing their wireless and video offerings, we believe increases to the bottom line will take a longer time to materialize, hence validating our hypothesis that earnings and free cash flow growth are likely to stay relatively stagnant compared to the growth rates in previous years. Verizon's recent purchase of AOL for their video and advertising assets are part of a wider shift to become a one-stop platform. Like AT&T, Verizon also is trying to diversify away from the traditional telco model to offer complimentary services such as video streaming and other content on the Verizon platform. As more Americans watch their favorite shows and sports segments on a mobile platform instead of on television, Verizon is trying to monetize this trend by encouraging increased data usage on phones through providing video streaming. By inking deals like the one with NFL for phone streaming rights, Verizon is providing a strong incentive for subscribers to access more content on their smartphones. Management also has been very strategic about this initiative - sports is something that people want to watch in real-time to experience the thrill and excitement that comes with it. Their purchase of AOL signals another step toward building a suite of digital content assets and integrating them into the infrastructure of Verizon's platform. As they purchase and lease more content, Verizon is able to entice subscribers to use more data to access content on-the-go, thereby boosting data revenues. Again, we need to recognize that this process takes time. Although this is almost certainly beneficial to their bottom line in the long-run, these acquisitions and content leasing deals will be a financial strain in the short term, especially when coupled with the high debt load from the buyout of Verizon Wireless. Wireline Revenues Declining At Slow, Steady Pace For many years now, Verizon's Wireline segment has been declining steadily. This has been in line with the company's strategy to focus more on Wireless and Video growth instead of its legacy wireline operations. Hence, management has been investing relatively less in developing this segment of the business, leading to a planned general decline in EBITDA, operating revenues and income over time. However, a bright spot is the mass markets segment, which includes FiOS internet and video services. This part of the wireline business has been growing very steadily and gaining subscribers at a healthy pace. As copper-to-FiOS migration and FiOS subscriber growth continues, we expect it to offset the decline in the other wireline categories. Assuming growth for the Mass Market segment grows at 3% - 3.5% compounded annually, and that the decline in other segments remains consistent with the average rate of decline in the past five years, the inflection point will happen in an estimated 4-6 years, where growth from mass markets will compensate for the decline in the other segments, resulting in an increase in overall wireline operating revenue. Therefore, for the next few years, we can expect wireline operating revenues to decline while segment EBITDA should remain stable. Overall, with the combination of slower wireless growth, the transition toward video and content acquisition, the continued sale of non-core assets and the slow decline of the wireline segment, Verizon's profitability for the next few years is likely to be stagnant. However, it remains a great company with massive potential to increase earning power, particularly after the company transitions to its model of using acquired digital content to stimulate higher data usage. Moreover, FiOS and the consumer wireline segment continue to grow strongly and will compensate for the decline in other wireline segments after a few years. Thus, we expect the share price to reflect this reality and to trade within a narrow range for the near term. However, long-term investors that are willing to hold for an extended period of time would be richly rewarded eventually as the company is taking steps to increase its profit potential. Given the tight range we expect the stock to trade, assuming a macro-neutral scenario, investors also could employ options strategies such as a covered call to maximize returns in this period. Bottom-line: Verizon's earnings and cash flow may be stuck in a rut for the next few years, but they will resume a healthy upward climb once the company's strategies start paying off.
