ETF Hub Jun 12 2015, 19:30 ET | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor Roughly 18 months after first striking a deal with Katie Couric, Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) has extended its deal with the news anchor. Re/code reports Couric's annual pay is being increased "from upwards of $6 million to $10 million." Couric is one of several high-profile Yahoo media hires has made during the Marissa Mayer era. During a May interview , Mayer insisted (amid criticism of the media hires) Yahoo is getting a good return on its investment in Couric. "You can do things like measure the ads that you’ve sold against those programs and the follow-on views. And they all mean this is a very profitable and good investment. But I will say, to me it was really more about raising [Yahoo's] journalistic standard..." 67% increase for what?  just do not see how this company can justify this expenditure for an also ran journalist. YHOO doing what YHOO does best !! (ie wasteful investments)....I am so glad I am out of this POS. at least Dick had the intelligence of knowing that he is not cut for this job...but Marissa M. is not even there. good luck to all YHOO longs but I would get out while you still can as this thing is going back to the teens soon ETF Screener: Search and filter by asset class, strategy, theme, performance, yield, and much more ETF Performance: View ETF performance across key asset classes and investing themes
