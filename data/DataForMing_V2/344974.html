Citi downgrades Yahoo on limited upside; shares fall - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha Mar 22 2016, 09:33 ET | By: Brian Pacampara, CFA , SA News Editor Yahoo ( YHOO -1.5%) is down in early trading after Citi analyst Mark May downgraded the company from Buy to Neutral, arguing that the risk/reward is more balanced following the stock’s recent run-up. May also upped his PT on the stock to $37 (from $32), representing about 4% worth of upside to its Monday closing price. With Yahoo shares up roughly 18% over just the past month, May thinks that the value from a sale or spin-off of the company's core business is now reflected in the valuation. Seems to me like a fair portion of the recent upswing is in part based on speculation as to MM walking the plank. The rumor mill may well keep that going over the next few weeks/months, so I'm staying put for now. I got a small position to ride the current sentiment, but the risk I see is that I really don't have much confidence in the company overall, whether she stays or goes. Just cashing in on the hype that it can become a player without her, even though I don't believe it, the price will go up as long as everybody else does.
