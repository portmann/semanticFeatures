YOU ARE HERE: Home » Saving Money » Amazon Completely Changed How You Can Share Your Prime Benefits and Not for the Better! Well, it looks like the sharing party is over my friends. I was gone this past weekend on a little trip and got a comment on one of my most popular articles. It shows you how to share your Amazon Prime shipping benefits with four other family members. Since I wrote it, it has been well received. Most people didn’t know you could share you Amazon Prime benefits. Either way, apparently Amazon has decided to change up how you are able to share your Prime account. This new change was introduced on August 1st, 2015. They have re-developedÂ the Amazon Household program . In doing so, they have removed the ability for people to share their Amazon shipping benefits with four other people. Before, all you needed to do was follow the few steps listed in this article . Now, you can’t do that any more. My dad and sister were listed under mine and were able to get my prime shipping benefit. That gave them free, two-day shipping on millions of products. They are no longer able to do this. So, what changed? I can count a number of possible reasons, but the main one is probably because they realized people were abusing the system. Their wording told you to share with members in your household or you could share with co-workers. The issue is there was no way to know who you were sharing with. While I only had my sister and father, I’m sure others had friends. There were a number of articles showing you how to save on an Amazon prime membership and this was the top tip. The other one was Amazon Student . It’s no surprise that Amazon wants more paying Prime customers. They are a business that thrives on having more customers. When you take Prime shipping away from those who were getting it for free, you might be able to convert them to paying customer. For us who are already paying customers, this doesn’t affect me much as I wasn’t getting money from my family to share my shipping benefits. This might not be the case with others. To get more paying customers, they introduced the Amazon Household program . This is where the sharing gets dismantled. Instead of sharing with other people and not having to worry about seeing their order profile information, now those in the household will be able to see your orders. This is what you see when you go to the regular “share your Prime benefits” page. The new Amazon Household program is literally designed for those in a household. It’s only for up to six people and four of those being children who don’t need Amazon accounts. Basically, it’s for two adults and four children. The kicker in the program come in when they talk about how to set it up. Here is a little note they put in there: Note: In order to share content, Prime benefits, and Amazon Mom benefits, both adult account holders need to authorize each other to use credit and debit cards associated with their Amazon accounts for purchases on Amazon. This will not affect either of their current payment settings, but each adult will be able to copy the credit and debit cards of the other account to his or her Amazon account and use them for purchases with Amazon. So, in order to actually share your benefits, you need to authorize the other adult account to use your credit/debit cards already in your Amazon account with the other adult. This means both account holders can use either card in both accounts. Basically, this weeds out anyone trying to share their Amazon Prime shipping benefits with anyone outside of their close family. You wouldn’t want your co-worker getting access to your credit cards and vise versa. That could end poorly. From what I’ve been told, you will also be able to see purchase histories between the two accounts. I can’t verify this, but that would be terrible. You wouldn’t be able to buy your significant other a gift without them knowing it. I will keep my eyes and ears out to see if this is actually true. Some said it was true with the regular sharing program, but I never found it and asked a number of people who couldn’t see the other people’s order history. Prior to this new change, you were only able to share your two-day shipping benefits and the Kindle library. I would say the whole reason to share was for the shipping benefits. Now, the Amazon Household program allows you to share a few more things inside your Amazon Prime account. Here they are. Since the traditional sharing method is gone, then you will need to set up and Amazon household if you want to share with someone you don’t mind having access to your credit cards. In order to set up a new Amazon Household system, you need to follow a few basic steps. Click here for the full instructions . Go to Amazon.com and sign into your account. Click on the Your account button at the top of the page when on an Amazon page. Click the Settings tab, then scroll down to the Households section.
