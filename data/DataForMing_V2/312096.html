Click to print (Opens in new window) For years the owners of iPhones with broken screens or damaged buttons looking to trade in their older device for a new one through Apple’s Reuse and Recycle trade-in program have been out of luck, unless they shelled out the cash to repair the smartphone first. That’s reportedly set to change with an upcoming revamp of the program.Â  9 to 5 Mac reports that starting this week Apple will roll out an updated version of its program that gives credit for iPhone 5 and iPhone 6/6 Plus phones with damaged displays, cameras, and buttons. The point of the newly expanded program, sources say, is to encourage customers to buy a new phone rather than simply repairing their current device. Of course, the new deal does have some catches, mainly that Apple says only phones damaged within reason will qualify. However, the company hasn’t specified what that means. Sources tell 9 to 5 Mac that the current trade-in values for the phones are $50 for a 5s, $200 for a 6, and $250 for a 6 Plus. In other Apple news, the company will reportedly allow its retail stores to install screen protectors for iPhones for the first time, 9 to 5 Mac reports. Previously, Apple Store associates were told not to perform screen protector installations on iPhones for fear that something would go wrong. Under the plan, in the coming weeks all stores will offer official plastic screen protector installation via a machine in the back of the store. So far, the company has partnered with scree protector maker Belkin for the program.
