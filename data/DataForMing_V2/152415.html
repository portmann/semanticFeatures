I spent a big chunk of yesterday on research and coordination that will show up in sone later original reporting. Plus we were lucky enough to come across some important cross posts. Just so you know, bona fide original reporting (even when we get a nice tidy nugget that makes for a contained piece) really does take more time than analysis and commentary, as useful as we think those are.

Why Bernie Sanders Should Add a Job Guarantee to His Policy Agenda Kanbur/Stiglitz: Rent Seeking as a Major Driver of Wealth and Income Inequality ? http://www.dw.com/en/a-look-at-southern-thailands-smoldering-insurgency/a-18591878 *According to Abuza, an average of 15 bombings and 16 shootings a month have been recorded in the region over the past five years. *Those fighting the Thai state include a raft of separatist organizations as well as, presumably, smaller cells and individual insurgents. They are up against some 70,000 security forces in the three border provinces. But the diverse and extremely decentralized nature of the insurgency makes it hard to pin down, as CSIS expert Poling explained. “Putin Revives Soviet Deal of Pretend-Work-and-Pay to Hide Crisis,” http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-17/putin-revives-soviet-deal-of-pretend-work-and-pay-to-hide-crisis In the meantime, on the nature of the human beast and our mutual vulnerabilities, see all the links, and stuff like this, http://www.newrepublic.com/article/122441/corn-wars One wonders what outcomes “we,” or at least those of us whose vote and leverage actually count, want (cf. “Need”) from ” our” political economy… Reports of massacres of civilians in rebel-held areas by the Syrian regime should be interpreted critically.     A preliminary investigation of the Douma market attack on 16 August 2015 has shown that 100 of the 105 fatalities were recorded as adult males, and  at least 95 of these were buried in mass graves.   As in previous massacres attributed to the regime, the segregation of victims by sex, and their burial in mass graves unclaimed by their families,  are consistent with a massacre of rebel-held captives. Regarding Carly Fiorina – I haven’t read the article, but as an electronics engineer I did watch with dismay as she ran that formerly great company into the ground by starving R&D and spinning the heart and soul of it off into Agilent.  She bought into every silly new management philosophy that came along while joining the race to the bottom with sh*tty consumer-grade computing equipment and peripherals.  It was very sad. What Blow reminds me of is there are a limited number of actual Black voices in the press and on opinion pages so Whites , who are not exposed to these issues , would have a limited idea of race. For example, would ending police brutality end racism related deaths? The answer is no. The health care or lack of treatment of Blacks due to views of race likely leads to allow of premature death. So, I, as a Black guy,  am subject to  people like Blow, who frankly I question whether they are serving the interest of all Black people or just Middle Class Bkack People. Police brutality is a real concern. However, if you are poor and Black, it is not your only concern. It must be nice to have the luxury of focusing one’s attention on just brutality or just voting rights rather the far ranging issues Black actually have to address. The NY Times ran a study about the following: http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/08/17/business/racial-wealth-gap-persists-despite-degree-study-says.html?referrer= My point is that we have the wrong people trying to engage folks like Sanders in the press . If their agenda isn’t to get Clinton elected (some aren’t and those that are should just be ignored  as opportunist ), they seem to lack an appreciation of the challenges of race beyond bumper sticker slogans. Being Black does not mean one understands how race related to class. Today’s Tech is also like yesterday’s tech: check out The Soul of a New Machine (1981) and tell me what has changed so much. Frederick Christ Trump, grandfather of Donald Trump, was also a true American entrepreneur. Immigrating to America in 1885, he began his fortune running the Arctic Restaurant and Hotel in Bennett, British Columbia, during the Klondike Gold Rush. Christine, who would later become his wife, was only 5 when he left Germany, but they kept in touch by mail and eventually married. http://genealogy.about.com/od/famous_family_trees/p/trump.htm â€œAmerica was a land of machines, and it was through machines, the miraculous handmaidens of mob culture, that the muses of illiteracy brought America her voice and vision during the years of the immigrantsâ€™ waves. Centuries ago, movable type had given literacy to the common man. Now, through these wondrous newer machines, he would give it back.â€? Nick Tosches certainly i have my questions about the bacon lettuce and mayonnaise sandwich movement… but many “organizations” origins and motives can be questioned… when i spoke with paul robesons son and his former personal secretary about why paul, the supposed communist could care less about fidel and che…they both said many used the communists because of the dirt cheap printing they would provide…and that batista was removed by a “white” fidel who campaigned that batista was not quite white enough to lead cuba.. when in chicago i poked around looking at the panther assassinations and ended up with a dirty cop (who may have been a partner of one of the cointelpro cops at “the event”) who put his gun to my head in front of a crowd as he tried to pin me to a wall(his wife pulled him off of me)…but I still can question the origins of the movement…as any adult would considering who put out the original publicity and film footage…but the panthers took on a life of their own…regardless of the side show of its origins… all this analysis paralysis…and eloquent ignorance… whatever their motives, the bacon lettuce and mayonnaise sandwich movement has found a way to use modern tools to get peoples attention I can question many public “radicals”… ramsey clarke signed off on cointelpro so it is funny watching him over the years claim to be this anti-them guy…especially when he was at that drowning of a civil rights fighter while they were on vacation… who cares if they ate johnnys peanut butter and jelly sandwich in kindergarten while sarah palin watched out for the hall monitors… Amortization of control fraud by liquidation of human beingsâ€¦ rinse and repeat and you have the classical business cycle. Some food for thought with a reference to Krugman as he is still beholden to the IS-LM â€œTo put it in the simplest possible terms: Krugman et al still talk (with occasional lapses into the realm of truth) as though the government has to finance its deficits by borrowing from the public, out of a fixed supply of loanable funds. Thus theyâ€™re still vulnerable to the â€˜crowding outâ€™ argument. If the government borrows out of the supply of loanable funds, it deprives private investors of those funds, thus crowding out their investment. The only reply one can give is that the government makes better investments than private investors. Does it? The Right are perfectly justified in questioning this assumption, and by casting doubt on it they can make the case for expansionary austerity. [â€¦] Krugman et al place the argument about austerity into a domain where it depends on intuition-swapping about the efficacy of state vs. private investment. Thatâ€™s a good place for the anti-austerity side to lose the argument. Better to stay within the domain of reality. There expansionary austerity makes no sense because crowding out is impossible â€“ speaking in terms of available money rather than available resources. Amazon and Jeff Bazos and the NYt articles.  I am amazed no one has gone postal yet at Amazon.  As described, the work conditions sounded similiar to the old post office which resulted in people snapping and a spree of mass work killings. Also makes me wonder about internal values.  Some people actually admire and defend the Amazon process.  So what sort of person could convince themselves that darwinian Amazon working conditions are for the greater good?  Where did the obtain their values or did they simply lack values and adopt the Amazon values?  Some sound like they wouldn’t have a problem working in a well run concentration camp. There is one point of nomenclature that I think could be cleared up and that is the use of the “C8? label which, in itself does not indicate any particular danger. Octanoic acid, which has 8 carbon atoms, occurs naturally. It is a fatty acid found many places, notably goats’ milk and coconuts. In other words, this is mother’s milk and nothing to do with Dupont or any other chemical company, except as they may use it to make other things. What brings me to this is that I have been using a garden fungicide consisting of copper octanoate. It is widely and openly available and in fact is just a form of soap. So far  I am not worried about it. Yet. What might be of concern is that the octanoic acid that is used to make copper soap is almost certainly synthesized as I don’t think anyone is bothering to collect it from coconuts. If this is a benign process, and it probably is, there should be no worry. On the other hand, should this involve the use of some vile catalyst or such a thing, then we all have to worry.
