Why An Apple Mobile GPU Is A Sensible Route - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple is working on a proprietary GPU, rumors suggest. It would make sense because Apple could improve its profit margins outsourcing only the production, while advancing hardware/software optimization. The timing is sensible since competiting graphic solutions are getting on par or better. Snapdragon 820 with Adreno 530 looks superior to Apple A9. Development will take at least a couple of years more since it's more difficult than modifying ready-to-use ARM architectures. Taking a look at recent Kantar data and the step back for TV content distribution, I rate Apple as a "hold" and wait for further developments. Apple Inc. ( AAPL ) has always been very strong on the GPU field with its Apple Ax SoCs: Apple A9 is a clear example of what it's capable of. However, there is the opinion that Apple may be working on its own mobile GPUs, leaving behind its partnership with Imagination Technologies. Fudzilla reported that Apple is working on its own proprietary GPU and it also affirms that Apple has commissioned the next 4G modem to Intel ( INTC ). Apple started to heavily customize its SoCs by modifying ARM ( ARMH ) architectures with its own developing team. This kind of approach permitted Apple to have an upper hand in certain periods by implementing new ARM features before competitors. At the same time, Apple has been able to customize the ARM cores by building a CPU architecture more suitable to run iOS. In this way, Apple is able to obtain high efficiency, good performances and low-power consumption with a very high optimization level. Qualcomm Inc. ( QCOM ) took a similar route in the past with its Krait cores, and it's doing the same with its new Kryo cores, implementing them in a big.LITTLE form factor: a couple of high performance Kryo cores and a couple of low power Kryo cores. Such an approach would have been far less efficient with the ARM A72 high performance cores. The development of custom Kryo cores look to be quite successful since a single Kryo performs very similarly to a single Apple Twister core ( 2456 against 2499 in Geekbench 3 single core). Even Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) is going to release its first custom ARM architecture with its own Mongoose M1: leaked benchmarks show that a Mongoose core is only slightly slower than Twister and Kryo (it scores 2296 in Geekbench 3 single thread). Creating a new GPU architecture instead is something completely different than customizing an already present CPU architecture. That is what Apple and Samsung have been doing for years. The fact that rumors concerning Apple's GPU are spreading recently, it may be the sign that some improvement has been carried on. But what would be the positive of using a proprietary GPU architecture? First of all, Apple could improve its own profit margins since it could cut off its GPU licensing from Imagination Technologies and it could send it directly to foundry partners. We are not talking about relevant profit improvements because Imagination Technologies generates revenues for $180.40 million from royalties and $59.17 million from licensing: this implies that the profit improvement could only reach the order of tens of millions of dollars from this point of view. Other savings could be achieved by optimizing and reducing the SoC area occupied from the GPU in order to reduce the SoC foundry production cost (given that Apple SoCs cost around $5-6 billion per year, such a reduction cost must be quite below $1 billion) Other than profits, the most important reason to project an Apple GPU is the software/hardware optimization. We have seen how the mere ARM CPU customization has provided high optimization levels with iOS, therefore, projecting an entire GPU architecture could be even more advantageous. Apple has created the Metal APIs that could be exploited even better with a specific Apple GPU architecture, providing consistent improvements and energy efficiencies. Another important factor which could push Apple to develop its own GPU architecture is competitors' solutions. Qualcomm has provided its phablet developer board for Snapdragon 820, which is powered by the Adreno 530. The results are extremely good from the graphic point of view, since it's able to beat Apple A9 in GFXbench, while it is on par in 3D Mark. This is a situation that we have seen even with the Snapdragon 810 against the Apple A8, but SD810 got a lot of heat issues that look to have been solved with SD820. This implies that performance must be roughly equal once throttling kicks in (if it kicks in), while SD810 was behind by 10% with long-term performances (with Xiaomi Mi Note Pro). Even Samsung is well set with its Exynos 8890 powered by Mali T880 MP12: leaked benchmarks show performances similar to Adreno 530, achieving very good results. A similar behavior was seen for Exynos 7420 this year, but at the same time it showed off very consistent CPU performance with heavy throttling for what concerns the GPU: the long-term GFXbench performance test demonstrated that Exynos 7420 in Galaxy S6 Edge Plus deteriorates graphic performances even by 60%, a very bad result. It's known that Mali T880 has great architectural and layout improvements compared to Mali T7xx, but it's to be seen if long-term performances will be consistent enough to meet competitors' scores. In any case, it's quite clear that Apple's competitors are heavily accelerating on the GPU performance field, therefore, this could push the Cupertino's company to implement some proprietary projects. That Apple is working on a proprietary GPU is likely to be true, and I personally think that it will still take two or three years to see its implementation (if it will be convenient enough). This route will not provide a relevant profit margin increase, but it will help optimize the hardware/software ecosystem to a level that is not attainable with third-party intellectual properties: it's well known how the hardware/software optimization is important the Apple ecosystem. At the same time, Apple got stuck and temporarily retreated from TV content subscription, which is quite a "hole" in the Apple TV strategy. It's still to be seen if Apple will provide iTunes movies with HEVC and 4K resolution with the Skylake update (even with an Apple TV which has no HW codec to run such videos at 4K and its HDMI port cannot sustain 4K content at 60 fps), or if it will wait for the next Apple TV update. Finally, as you can see in another article that I'm going to release, if we take a look at Kantar data for October, it looks like Apple will really see low single-digit growth for the iPhone in 1Q 2016. Given this scenario, I rate Apple as a "hold" and I highly recommend to wait for further developments before starting or ending any position.
