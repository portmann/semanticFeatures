Apple: iPhone's Cost Of Ownership Advantage - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple's iPhone offers lower cost of ownership than high-end competitors if resale value is factored in. Lower cost of ownership argues against a bear thesis that iPhone offers poor value compared to its competitors. Research from fellow SA contributor Sustainable Free Cash Flow indicates that the cost of ownership of an Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPhone is significantly lower than competing "high end" smartphones. This is due to iPhone's much higher resale value. The lower cost of ownership speaks not only to iPhone's cost competitiveness against its peers, but most importantly to Apple's growth potential in emerging markets. Following my article on Apple in India, I received a number of comments questioning how anyone in India could afford an iPhone. As I thought about it, I realized that I didn't have a particularly good answer. Based on the data I presented in the article, the criterion for middle class status (as presented in a Credit Suisse report ) was to have a minimum wealth of $13,662. Under this definition, there were just 23.6 million members of the middle class in all of India. In contrast, the minimum wealth criterion for China was $29,245 with a membership of 108.8 million. I found myself wondering how Apple could even sell millions of iPhones every quarter in China. Even with the steep 26% drop last quarter in revenue from Greater China, Apple still managed revenue of $12.49 billion. Assuming that at least half of that was in iPhone sales, then unit sales were over 7 million for the quarter. The best answer to the Indian question I could come up with was that the Indian economy could be expected to grow over time, and with it the size and wealth of the middle class. But even Apple's recent growth of 56% in India, reported by Canalys , seemed a little counter intuitive. I was still missing a piece of the cost puzzle. Recently fellow contributor Sustainable Free Cash Flow (let's just call him SFCF) called my attention to some cost of ownership data for smartphones that he and his students had been collecting from resale sites such as Swappa.com. After looking at his data, I realized that here was the missing piece in the cost story. So let me touch briefly on the methodology. Swappa is a resale site where the seller sets the price of the device (smartphone, tablet or other devices such as VR systems). Swappa adds a small fee on top of that price that the buyer pays, so the prices on Swappa are representative of the money that sellers make in reselling their devices. Swappa also provides ongoing price summaries of resale prices by devices, such as this chart for resale prices for the unlocked iPhone 6S : SFCF and his students have been mining the Swappa site for insights into total cost of ownership for various smartphone brands. In the chart below I show some results for average retail and resale prices for smartphones resold about 18-22 months after model launch. These are unlocked "high end" smartphones costing $500 or more. The averages are over various models for each brand, as well as individual resales on Swappa. Because of the nature of the data, it's not possible to show data for all devices at exactly the same time from launch, and the average time from launch varies according to brand. In the following chart, I've normalized the cost of ownership to a monthly cost that accounts for the slight differences in time from launch. I also include the time from launch average for each brand for comparison. As the reader can see, Apple's monthly cost, when resale value is factored in, is among the lowest of the "high end" smartphone models. Reselling iPhones on sites such as Swappa has become the means by which savvy consumers make iPhone more affordable, once the initial capital commitment is made. There are iPhones for resale on Swappa from all the major carriers as well as unlocked phones, so in many cases, the capital commitment up front doesn't need to be that large. A consumer can buy an iPhone on contract with a carrier in the US, then sell it in two years on Swappa when the contract expires. The resale value of iPhone pokes another hole in the bear case against Apple, that iPhone is just an overpriced toy that Apple sells at a premium due to its brand appeal. I've consistently argued that the bears have it backwards. The brand is appealing because of the strength of Apple's products, not the other way around. The intrinsic strength of the iPhone is very much reflected in its resale value. The strengths of iPhone are in many areas but include industry leading processor performance, best in class hardware and operating system integration, and perhaps most importantly the confidence that the consumer will be able to use the latest version of iOS over the life of the phone. The situation in Android phones is almost diametrically opposite when it comes to Android upgrades, except for Google's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) own Nexus devices. The high resale value of iPhone goes a long way to explaining how it can be affordable in emerging markets. Everywhere iPhone is, there's a booming resale market. If aliexpress.com is any indicator, consumers in China have only to go online to buy or sell a used iPhone. Although I don't have statistics yet to support this assertion, I suspect that virtually every working iPhone that is replaced by a new iPhone is resold. Why? Because they're worth money. This means that a fundamental assumption of Apple bears that Apple's iOS device population is static is unrealistic. If most used iPhones are being resold, then most used iPhones are being reused. As consumers buy new iPhones, their old ones continue to be used by others, thus growing the overall population of iPhones and iPhone users. iPhone resale value is really important to growing the iPhone ecosystem. Finally, the higher resale value of iPhone shows how Apple can make inroads in emerging markets such as India, if Apple can contrive to relieve the up front cost of the phone. Financing, on very favorable terms, purchases in emerging markets sound like a great use of some of Apple's overseas cash. Recent reports out of India indicate that Apple may have some barriers yet to overcome before establishing an effective presence in India. Probably the establishment of a local factory for iPhone by Foxconn will prove critical. Once this is done, there's no longer a "local content" restriction barring Apple stores in India, and Apple may yet obtain a waiver on the strength of its manufacturing plans. Continued growth in emerging markets is crucial to Apple's growth going forward, and the lower cost of ownership of iPhone indicates that growth expectations are reasonable rather than far fetched. Apple needs to do more to lower the initial cost barrier to ownership, and probably will through generous financing. A resumption of sustained growth in iPhone sales will be seen as very positive by investors, but this may take time. India will take time, possibly 2-3 years to establish a factory. Probably Apple needs to focus on China more in the near term by offering incentives such as generous financing. I also expect iPhone 7 to be a catalyst for global sales for calendar Q3 and Q4. I still expect iP7 to be more innovative than recent rumors credit. While fiscal 2016 has been a tough compare with fiscal 2015, I expect Apple to do better in fiscal 2017. I remain long Apple and recommend it as a buy for investors with a 3-5 year investment horizon. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
