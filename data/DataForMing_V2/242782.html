Click to print (Opens in new window) If there’s one piece of advice we all turn to in the face of a malfunctioning piece of electronics, it’s “try turning it off, and then back on again.” That basic approach is proving to be the go-to for Apple right now, as it advises iPad Pro owners on how to revive their devices after the screen goes unexpectedly dark. Apple is offering up the forced restart as a temporary solution for Pro owners who have been reporting on Apple’s support forum , MacRumors and Reddit (h/t Mashable ), among other places, that their devices suddenly sport a black screen, often after the iPad has been charging. “Learn what to do if your iPad Pro doesn’t respond when you press buttons or tap on the screen, and the screen is black,” a message on Apple’s support site reads . “To get back to using your iPad Pro, force restart it by pressing and holding both the Sleep/Wake and Home buttons for at least ten seconds, until you see the Apple logo.” Apple adds that it’s aware of the issue and will continue investigating, so here’s to hoping the company comes up with a solution other than the one everyone else in the world will offer you as help for any issue with electronics.
