Ford Europe's Growth Mission Could Support Upward Breakout Of Share Price - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford Europe's operational restructuring is starting to yield results, with November 2015 being a turnaround month. VW's emission fiasco has helped other carmakers gain market share, with Ford being one of the biggest beneficiaries. Their strengthening pole position in commercial vehicles and growing passenger segment market share will contribute to stock price increases over the next few quarters. Back in 2012, when the then Ford (NYSE: F ) CEO Alan Mulally outlined his plan to completely overhaul operations across its European facilities, it caused waves of anger and resentment rippling across the labor communities spanning Genk, Belgium , the Transit van plant in Southampton and the Dagenham UK panel-stamping facility . "In October 2012, we committed to commence a transformation plan for our Europe operations. As part of this plan, we closed two manufacturing facilities in the United Kingdom in 2013 and closed our assembly plant in Genk, Belgium at the end of 2014. The Genk closure was subject to an information and consultation process with employee representatives, which was completed in June 2013. The costs related to these closures were recorded beginning in the second quarter of 2013." The objectives were clear - stem the loss of $1.5 billion from European operations by cutting back on excess production capacity and optimize existing facilities. Although the move alienated locals from the American car manufacturer, the decision was one that kept the company's interests at the forefront. Today that decision is being justified as Ford Europe successfully emerges from the ashes of loss and enters a new era of profitability. North America Remains Dominant Market Segment Ford North America has always been the majority breadwinner for the company, and it was this division that almost single-handedly kept the company profitable with $6.9 billion in income before taxes in 2014 that gave them a grand total of $2.55 billion. Nearly every other unit posted losses: South America $1.16 billion; Middle East and Africa $20 million; and even Europe at $1.06 billion. It did have a little help from the $589 million coming from the Asia-Pacific division. How Ford Europe is On Its Way to Profitability In 2014, Ford U.S. was the only truly profitable segment, but I believe Europe will add to that list very soon. Let's not forget that Ford is still the number one commercial vehicle seller in Europe with a 12.7 percent market share YTD, their best performance since 1996 . Their loss-making days are hopefully behind them, and November has been the turning point in a long and disastrous journey that began well before 2012. Since Volkswagen's ( OTCPK:VLKAY ) embarrassing involvement in the "Diesel-gate" affair, their brand name has taken a bad hit and is already helping other car makers like GM (NYSE: GM ) and Ford make inroads into their markets. This November Ford Europe registered a handsome 20.5% sales increase in sales. On the other side of the coin, Volkswagen saw their market-share drop from 26.8% a year earlier to 24.5% in November 2015. It doesn't seem that bad when you consider the extent to which the scandal was covered in the media across Europe and the world, but when the industry leader loses any kind of ground the rest of the pack swoops in to scavenge and take advantage of the company's misfortunes. Along with the success of newer Transit models in the commercial segment and new Fiesta and Kuga models in the passenger car segment, VW's shaken position has been a key driver in helping Ford limp back to recovery after several loss-making years in the European Union. This year, November marks a major turnaround for Ford Europe as the EU market is set to recover with sales for November 2015 recording a 13.7% growth . This brings the region's consecutive growth streak to 27 months. Ford Europe saw a 7.5% increase YTD until November, and the month itself saw a huge upswing of 20.5% over November 2014. Although Ford only sold 76k vehicles in November and currently holds a market share of only 7% against VW's 24.3%, they have momentum building up behind them. It looks like Ford Europe has been one of the main beneficiaries of Volkswagen's drop in market share this year. Don't forget that Ford Europe is the second largest revenue earner for the Ford group (nearly three times that of the Asia Pacific division) and has been bleeding for quite some time. Since the 2012 restructuring announcement the company has been shuffling its way to normalcy, and I believe things are finally coming to a head this quarter. Investor-speak: Ford Europe and F Outlook I believe their best years are still ahead of them. Their product pipeline is constantly reinventing itself and they are at the top of commercial vehicle segment, while slowly moving up in the passenger car segment. Ford will be aiming to improve its single digit market share in Europe where the dominant group has its brand names on one out of every four passenger car sold in the EU. Since Ford Europe's parent company itself is one of the giants of the automobile industry, I don't expect their stock to do a song and dance and show steep increases just because they showed an increase of 64,000 cars in Europe YTD. However, I do expect that the strength of their Europe division will eventually reflect on their income statements and, as a result, on their earnings and share price. Since 2013 Ford stock has been trading in a relatively tight range with recent lows around $14. That's where it's at right now and I expect it will breakout upwards - if North America and Europe can jointly move the numbers up during the coming quarters.
