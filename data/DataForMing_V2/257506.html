The Brewster's Millions Spending At Yahoo Is Coming To An End - Time To Go Long Soon - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha The core Yahoo business and its cash hoard are being severely undervalued by the market for one logical reason. The lack of confidence in the CEO, executives fleeing, and the rampant spending cause great concern and artificially lower the stock price. As I write this on Sunday, the Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) board of directors is apparently weighing options for the company's future. Perhaps Monday or soon all will be revealed - will they proceed with the Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) spinoff? Probably so - and apparently with the blessing of accountants. Once Alibaba's stake and Yahoo Japan (combined for about 100% of the share price) are gone - the core business and new massive cash hoard have to be evaluated on their own. Yahoo's share price is low, as everyone's greatest fear is that the current CEO will have the opportunity to go hog wild and waste the money, Brewster's Millions style. The original 1902 book Brewster's Millions was about a man who stands to inherit 7 million if he can spend 1 million in 30 days and completely waste it all. It has been made into 10 different movies during the 20th century, most familiar to American audiences in the 1985 Richard Pryor version. I did not know that 3 separate Bollywood versions have been produced. Perhaps after leaving Yahoo Mayer can take some of her >$200 million she will have extracted from Yahoo and travel to New Delhi, where she can have a fourth version made. Here is a link to the board of directors : I note that of the nine board members currently serving - 3 were already on the board in mid 2012 - essentially hiring Marissa Mayer. These include Webb, McInerny, and James. Webb is Chairman of the Board. Mayer is on the board. And Jerry Filo, as a founder and "Chief Yahoo" can act as a wildcard if he supports Mayer's strategy. Some of the new members of the board came on in 2014 and perhaps are more open to change, or at least less invested in the spending strategy. Presumably some awkward talks are going on over in Sunnyvale, and I suspect the real discussion occurs in private conversations when the CEO is not around. What the board is finally having to face is the full attention on the stagnant core business. Since 2012 revenue has been stable and earnings have declined. Spending on various companies - often in order to poach staff working there- and various initiatives has topped 5 billion now; so far without gain. Most of us still using Yahoo (and this is a valuable property, worth billions if spending could be controlled) do not feel the actual desktop or mobile experience has improved in the last few years. The hiring and firing of Henrique de Castro as COO , paying him more than $100 million for a years work, then eliminating his position as unnecessary alone qualifies Mayer as the spiritual successor to Brewster. And wouldn't you sit like this all day if you were de Castro? How I'm investing: I am long Yahoo common stock, although have hedged a bit with some January 2016 $35 puts. This is just in case Alibaba crashes before the spinoff or it becomes clear that the board of directors is doubling down on Mayer by giving her free reign to buy more Pets.com type products. I'm overall bullish based on sum of the parts analysis . There has been a bit of a share price bump since my last article suggesting Yahoo will rise once Mayer resigns due to speculation over the same. I still think this will happen later in 2016 but of course could be proven wrong any time. Good luck to all! We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
