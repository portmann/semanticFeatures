Microsoft Trade-In Program Pays $200 For Your Old Windows Laptop, $300 For A MacBook ? Consumerist Whoops! It looks like portions of our site are being blocked!

Click to print (Opens in new window) Microsoft is hoping a $200 trade-in offer will help convince current Windows users to stick around, and that $300 is enough to win over Mac users. Microsoft launched the Easy Trade Up promotion on its website Friday, giving customers the opportunity to earn cash for trading in their older laptop – even a Mac – and buying a new Windows 10 machine. Under the program, the company will hand over between $200 for older Microsoft computers and $300 for MacBooks if customers buy a qualifying computer (priced $600 or more) from?the Microsoft store before October 20 and send in their older machines. There are a few conditions for the program, of course: trade-ins have to be under six years old and in working order with a minimum display size of 11.6 inches. It’s unclear if customers have to foot the bill for mailing in their old computers or if Microsoft will send back the devices if they are deemed unfit for trade-in. We’ve reached out to Microsoft for clarification on these issues and will update the post when we hear back. The Verge points out that the deal is similar to others that Microsoft has used to drum up sales in the past. The company previously offered $200 rebates for iPads traded in for Surface tablets and $100 rebates for PS3 users who switched to the Xbox One.
