Apple: What TSMC Has Revealed About Apple's Future - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha TSMC's Q3 earnings teleconference revealed a great deal about its partnership with Apple. TSMC's future growth is very much tied to Apple. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (NYSE: TSM ) Q3 earnings conference telecast shed much light on its partnership with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), as well as future plans for the partnership. It's a win-win for both companies that will propel growth and innovation as they compete with arch rival Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ). Increasingly, innovation is being driven by this rivalry, especially in smartphones, rather than traditional PCs. One of my ongoing themes has been the paradigm shift towards the custom system on chip (SOC) and away from general purpose commodity processors in mobile devices. Companies such as Apple and Samsung have taken their traditional role as device systems integrators and moved this process down to the silicon level. Apple, Samsung and others take various forms of IP and integrate this into a final SOC design. This IP might be in the form of designs for graphics processors from Imagination Technologies, CPU cores from ARM Holding (NASDAQ: ARMH ) as well as so-called physical IP that determines how the transistors and other devices are fabricated on chip. Those of you who have read past articles by me on this topic may be getting a little tired of my bringing it up. Sorry. But I do that because, first of all, it would be bad journalistic form to assume too much prior reader familiarity, and because the theme really has taken time to sink in to participants and observers of the semiconductor industry. So I was very gratified when Mark Liu, co-CEO of TSMC pointed to the growing role of what he terms the "fabless system company" in his opening remarks: We now see a new breed of fabless system companies coming to join the plate of semiconductor product innovation. With the enhanced SoC integration and system software and hardware integration, new usage models with brand-new markets are opening up for the semiconductor industry. We have been working with these fabless system companies for several years. Of course, the most important of these is Apple. During the telecon, TSMC made it clear what I have pretty much taken for granted, that "just one customer" is taking most of TSMC's 16 nm FinFET production. That one customer cannot be other than Apple. Given that TSMC had only started ramping their 16 nm production at the beginning of Q3, and that reports have it that TSMC is supplying more than half of the A9 SOCs for the iPhone 6s/6s Plus, it's unlikely that TSMC has much production left for anyone else. TSMC was asked about the apparent superiority of TSMC's version of the A9 (in terms of power efficiency and battery life) that has been widely reported in the media for the iPhone 6s. Rather than try to capitalize on the advantage, TSMC pointed out that "our customer" has already addressed the subject, noting that the differences were small. The differences in performance at the chip level really aren't that small, but in "real world" tests, the chip difference gets diluted by other factors such as screen power consumption. The important takeaway here is that TSMC does seem to have the better process compared to Samsung, even if it is a little bulkier . Apple is not disadvantaging itself by shifting its business to TSMC. That shift appears to be running ahead at full steam. TSMC indicated that the 16 nm production ramp will continue during 2016 Q1. This implies that the ramp will continue until Apple's full demand can be met (along with other customers), so I still consider it likely that Samsung will be out as a source for the A9 by the end of the year, or early 2016. TSMC management also had a great deal to say about the overall smartphone market and China in particular that has direct bearing on expectations for Apple in calendar Q3. Mark Liu pointed to the ongoing "bifurcation" of the smartphone market between the high end players, Apple and Samsung, and the rest of the market, something which has been observed by many in the industry, including Qualcomm's (NASDAQ: QCOM ) management. This is hurting TSMC in the short term. TSMC noted that demand had slowed for its slightly older, 20 nm process as the high end players moved to 14-16 nm FinFET, while the rest of the industry suffered. Even though TSMC is ramping the 16 nm process as fast as they can, this isn't making up for the lost business at the low end. TSMC guided to a 9% y/y reduction in revenue to $6.26 billion. TSMC says it started noticing the drop off in demand from the budget smartphone makers in China from the beginning of the year, which is when TSMC thinks the slowdown in China started. What's interesting about this is that the slowdown didn't impact Apple adversely in China for either the March or June quarters. This confirms my belief that the slowdown in China will have minimal effect on Apple in the September quarter (fiscal 2015 Q4). Also, given that both Samsung and TSMC are supplying chips for iPhone 6s, this also suggests that demand is quite strong. I'll have more quantitative analysis for my earnings preview article. One of the topics that seemed to perplex analysts during the telecon was the reduction in projected capital expenditures (CAPEX) for the year to $8 billion from a more recent forecast of $10.5-11 billion. TSMC cited various reasons for this, including operating efficiency gains and tool reuse in the conversion from 20nm to 16 nm production capacity. Still, it made analysts uncomfortable. It seemed to suggest that the outlook for 16 nm production was much less than TSMC's bullish, though non-specific pronouncements. Let me offer an alternative theory. One of the explanations offered was a rather vague "changes in the investment projects". A possible change that could have occurred is that Apple stepped in with significant capital investment, to the tune of about $2.0 billion. Apple is known to do this with supplier partners, as a way of guaranteeing production availability, as well as providing a useful outlet for Apple's abundant overseas cash. In Apple's June quarter SEC 10Q , Apple notes that it has numerous off-balance sheet commitments for the purpose of acquiring capital assets including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment. Current obligations as of the end of June were $4.8 billion, and in addition, the Apple noted that it had incurred another $2.1 billion in obligations after June 27. Nowhere is the importance of the new paradigm shift more apparent than in the way it is driving innovation in the semiconductor industry. It's clear that Samsung and TSMC are going to move forward to 10 nm as fast as they can. In my recent TSMC article , I pointed out that TSMC had projected being in production on 10 nm by the end of 2016 during the Q2 earnings presentation. This naturally raised some eyebrows, and TSMC was asked during the Q3 telecon if they still believe that they can get into production that fast. The answer was a little equivocal, and seemed to imply that their principal customer, Apple, wasn't driving the schedule. Probably, Apple wouldn't want to assume that 10 nm will be ready in time for the Fall 2016 launch, and so took some of the pressure off TSMC. On the other hand, I expect Apple to be highly motivated to start producing 10 nm SOCs as soon as the process is available. This year, Samsung was able to put their own Exynos 7420 chip into production on the 14 nm FinFET process ahead of Apple. I'm sure Apple doesn't want to repeat the experience. Part of the advantage of having a foundry that isn't also a competitor is that Apple won't have to wait when TSMC starts 10 nm production. TSMC was unequivocal when asked if 10 nm would be in production in 2017. That seems like a safe projection, and probably will be earlier in the year rather than later. I expect that when TSMC is ready, Apple will want to move to that node as quickly as possible. So the initial next gen A10 SOC will probably be produced on 16 nm FinFET for the next iPhone (7). Then once 10 nm is ready, Apple may want to switch production for it, even before introducing a successor SOC. It really depends on the timing of production, and whether Samsung is ready with their own 10 nm process. Having TSMC as a trusted supplier gives Apple this flexibility. The key takeaway for Apple is that this is really a much better situation than what it had with Samsung. Apple gets a foundry that doesn't have conflicting motives and which Apple doesn't have to worry about in terms of product information leaks. I really doubt that anything Samsung offered by way of "firewalls" between its foundry and the electronics business could really have satisfied Apple in the long run. Also, with TSMC, Apple has a great outlet for its offshore cash that can be used for competitive advantage. We might be surprised and see TSMC jump out in front in the race to 10 nm on the strength of Apple's capital infusion. I certainly wouldn't be surprised if TSMC's capex continues to be "mysteriously" low. The partnership with TSMC will lead to competitive advantage for both companies. TSMC will see its process development accelerated, and Apple devices will achieve superior performance as a result and enter the market more quickly. TSMC management repeatedly referred to other opportunities in computing devices, based on their association with this "new breed" of company, but wouldn't go into details on the extent of the market opportunity. TSMC spoke in generalities about general purpose computers, wearables, data center, networking, and Internet of Things. Clearly TSMC expects its business with Apple to expand beyond the iPhone, at the very least to iPad, and probably beyond. TSMC sees its partnership with Apple as a continuing source of growth, and so should investors.
