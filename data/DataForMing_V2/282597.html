Disney makes it official: 'Star Wars' is all-time domestic box-office king - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha To screen ETFs by asset class, performance, yield and more, check out the ETF Hub. ETF Hub Jan  6 2016, 19:44 ET | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Star Wars: The Force Awakens has gone farther, farther away than any movie in domestic box-office history, as Walt Disney ( DIS -0.5%) says it has passed Avatar's $760.5M total in just 20 days. It might have set the mark yesterday, but sat just on the cusp with $758.2M. Avatar had set its record with a complete 34-week theatrical run in 2009 and a special re-release in 2010. On a global basis, The Force Awakens' $1.56B makes it still No. 4, behind Avatar, Titanic and Jurassic World. That last film is next in Disney's sights, with $1.669B worldwide gross, and that should be easy pickings with The Force Awakens set to open in China, the world's No. 2 film market, on Saturday. A rampaging success there is no sure thing , however, as the series doesn't have major history in the Middle Kingdom. A Hollywood Reporter poll of theater-chain CEOs suggests the film will draw just $200M-$330M in China. Previously: Report: Starz gets bargain pay-TV rights to 'The Force Awakens' (Jan. 05 2016) I heard a commentator on Bloomberg yesterday call the "Force Awakens" old news and in the past from the analysts perspective.  They are still myopic on this cord cutting theme.  It all reeks of manipulation to keep the stock price down until Disney comes out with a monster beat at next earnings announcement.   Waiting for price to stabilize on the downside, then time to buy more. I hope the headlines are as bullish as they have been bearish on the success of Star Wars? It seems like no matter what they want to beat the mouse up. I hope Bob I. Drops a huge number next earnings and the shorters feel the dark side of the force!!! At least that's one positive for this year although it obviously isn't enough to help Disney's stock price or anyone else's for that matter.
