Why Fitbit Doesn't Need To Worry About The Apple Watch - Fitbit (Pending:FIT) | Seeking Alpha Many analysts consider the Apple Watch a threat to Fitbit, but there is little actual market overlap. Single-purpose wearable devices have distinct appeal, separate from multipurpose smartwatches. There are technical and practical advantages to dedicated devices which smartwatches cannot match, including battery life, durability, and ease of use. Insurance company data collection, patient generated healthcare data, and corporate wellness programs will all drive the dedicated fitness tracking market forward. Given Fitbit's (Pending: FIT ) upcoming IPO - which has generated considerable excitement - it's a good time to look at the overall wearable market and its current trajectory. As other Seeking Alpha articles have pointed out, there are some major new entrants into the wearable space. The Apple Watch (NASDAQ: AAPL ) in particular has been held up as a potential Fitbit-killer. This is unlikely for a few reasons, which I'll discuss below. The wearable market is, however, at an inflection point. Up until recently, the market was dominated by dedicated fitness devices. Going forward, it will likely segment into three broad categories. These are: Smart clothing that relays muscle-activation data and breathing patterns Many assume that the Apple Watch and other smartwatches will take significant market share from dedicated fitness-trackers, or replace them entirely. Here's why that's unlikely. While some people will use smartwatches as a replacement for dedicated fitness trackers, there are practical and technical factors holding back the widespread adoption of smartwatches as fitness devices. One of the main benefits to single purpose devices is that they can specialize on one task, and focus their design entirely around that function. For Fitbit, this has meant creating a durable, easy to use device that can last multiple days on a single charge. Multipurpose devices, in contrast, have to make compromises in their design. The Apple Watch is larger than a standard Fitbit, the interface is less intuitive (i.e., you have to think about it), and the battery has to be recharged at least daily. While these are all benefits to the Apple Watch in other areas (the larger screen allows for useful apps, the interface supports more functions, etc.), they are hindrances to pure fitness tracking. These issues are also unlikely to dramatically change within the next few years. Fashion is another component. While the Apple Watch needs to looks good (and therefore draw attention itself), Fitbits are largely designed to be invisible. You can wear one throughout the day and forget about it. They upload data automatically, and provide a constant record of your activity. Users don't have to worry about them being scratched or damaged either - one of the key selling points is durability. There's also the issue of price. The basic Fitbit model starts at $59.95, which puts it firmly in impulse-buy territory. The lowest-priced Apple Watch is $349. While there are cheaper android-based smartwatches, none have shown any true ability to break into the fitness tracking market. This is likely because the simplicity and clear use-case of fitness trackers is more appealing to customers than the more complex, less intuitive uses of current smartwatches. In these ways, Fitbit can be viewed as roughly analogous to GoPro (NASDAQ: GPRO ). While there are plenty of multipurpose devices that record high quality video (read: smartphones), people are still willing to pay for a well-designed single-purpose device that's dead simple to use. Fitbit fulfills this definition for activity tracking. In April, life-insurance company John Hancock became one of the first major insurance companies in the U.S. to launch an activity tracking program for its customers. Other major insurers will almost certainly follow suit. In a recent survey of insurance executives , 63% predicted wearables will have a "significant impact" on their industry. As has happened with auto insurance, health insurance companies are beginning to see the benefit of directly monitoring their customers' activity and adjusting premiums accordingly. And while some customers may voice privacy concerns, recent data suggests that most Americans are willing to accept such monitoring in exchange for potentially lower insurance premiums. As insurance companies begin to adopt these programs, they'll need devices that are intuitive, inexpensive enough to be distributed to millions of customers, and compatible with most smartphones. Fitbit's product line fulfills these needs. Which is probably why John Hancock chose their devices to distribute to every new policy holder. This will likely be one of many such deals to come. Hospitals and physicians are also increasingly embracing patient generated data for use in tailored diagnoses and preventative care. The latest Meaningful Use guidelines proposed by the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) call for 15% of patients to contribute patient-generated health data into their electronic health record. It will be up to the provider to collect this information. Since Meaningful Use is the certification system that the CMS uses to determine which providers are eligible for financial incentives (and soon, which providers will face fines), such rules have an outsized effect on healthcare technology. Some vendors have already begun to build out integrations with fitness trackers in order to help providers collect this patient data. Major ambulatory EHR vendor eClinicalWorks, for instance, now has integrations with Fitbit, Jawbone, and Withings. As patient generated data becomes more important for healthcare providers, there will be an incentive for them to encourage patients to adopt fitness trackers. Dedicated devices again provide the simplest entry point for most people. Corporate wellness is now estimated to be an $8 billion industry , and shows no signs of slowing down. As healthcare costs have risen, employers have turned towards in-house programs in an attempt to minimize their risks. A recent RAND study found that half of U.S. employers now offer wellness programs. A common feature of these programs are activity goals, which are tied to financial or social rewards. For such programs to work however, the experience has to be simple enough for employees to easily grasp, and cost-effective for the company. While smartwatches fulfill the data-collection needs of wellness programs, they remain far from cost-effective. There are also issues surrounding corporate network security, potentially time-wasting apps, and smartphone compatibility. Fitness trackers, on the other hand, work with all major smartphones, pose no threat to corporate networks, and are inexpensive enough to distribute at scale. As such, they will likely remain the default choice for corporate wellness programs for the foreseeable future. The Apple Watch is a great product, but there's far less market overlap with Fitbit than many analysts would have you believe. Additionally, there are a number of large trends driving the adoption of single-purpose fitness trackers, and Fitbit is better positioned than any other company to benefit from this. When deciding whether to invest, due diligence is always crucial. But investors shouldn't let supposed competition from Apple discourage them from evaluating Fitbit on its own merits.
