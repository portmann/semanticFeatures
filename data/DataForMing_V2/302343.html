With analyst expectations almost 50% above Apple's current price, and only 1 "sell" recommendation among the 52 analysts covering the "no brainer" stock, one has to wonder how long it will be before the 45 "Buys" downgrade their permabullish perspective..

The market bubble just kept expanding. Watch the Fed get scared again and double their balance sheet and do QE4.
