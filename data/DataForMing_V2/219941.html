The Market Got Ford's Earnings Wrong - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha We think the market has it wrong. It's not about short term outlook or next year's outlook, it's about 5+ years from now. While the market seems ambivalent about how it wants to react to Ford's (NYSE: F ) earnings, we are not. The US automaker came out Tuesday and beat on revenue while slightly missing on earnings-per-share - but only due to a higher tax rate that analysts were not expecting. Momentum with F-150 sales, global sales, and continued investments in itself were all positive, topping off a generally positive report that we think the market got wrong. The company continues to update it shareholders on its progress globally, and we are happy with how things are going, despite the headline miss. This drubbing in the stock comes after what has been a great month, where Ford has rallied from $13.25 all the way above $15. We think the market has it wrong selling off Ford here. First, credit and incentives continue to help fuel the business, but not so much that it has become a detriment. While there is continued easy access to credit, and while Ford still has the incentives lever to pull a little bit more, the company should keep coasting on sales. We saw this same type of positivity in sales from General Motors (NYSE: GM ) just days ago. We remain confident in the core fundamentals of the business moving forward here. Third-quarter revenue rose 9% to $38.1 billion due to higher sales in the U.S. and Europe, but softness in China and emerging markets is tempering the company's outlook. Ford said sales volumes in Asia Pacific fell 12% compared with a year earlier. The auto maker, a late mover to China, the world's largest car market, spent heavily to add significant production capacity in that country just as demand started to cool. While stronger demand in Europe helped offset China's sales decline, those gains haven't yet benefited the bottom line. The loss in Europe narrowed to $182 million, from a $439 million deficit a year ago. Ford hasn't forecast when its European losses will end. Operating profit in Asia-Pacific was a modest $20 million in the quarter, less than half of the earnings there a year earlier. Ford lost $163 million in South America, slightly better than a year ago. Its Ford Credit finance arm contributed $541 million to the quarter's profit, up from $498 million in the same period a year ago. There seems to be a lot of confusion about the quality of Ford's earnings. The company only missed its headline estimates because of a higher tax rate. The company paid 33% in taxes, as opposed to the 32% that analysts were predicting. There were also concerns about whether or not the company would be able to meet its estimates for fourth-quarter and for the full year. The company reaffirmed it's outlook for the full year, and CFO Bob Shanks, in an interview with Bloomberg, made some very bullish comments about the company's future. Here are some highlights, "I don't think we're peaking," Bob Shanks, Ford's CFO, said in an interview. "It's bizarre, if you just meet expectations, somehow you've let the market down." The earnings per share miss "is entirely due to a tax rate difference," Shanks said. "We came right on in terms of operating results, but we had a 33 percent tax rate. The analysts on average had a 32 percent tax rate." "The fourth quarter is usually the weakest of our four quarters," Shanks said. "But it's going to be an extremely strong quarter and on a year-over-year basis the numbers are going to pop. It's going to be extremely impressive. I'm not talking about a bad quarter." "Shanks said this is not as good as it gets for Ford." "We've got several years ahead of us that are going to be really, really good," Shanks said. "North America is going to continue to run and operate and deliver very strong results." We also read a couple of articles that suggested that General Motors was the better bet over Ford, because of the dividends and the buyback. As we've said, this is an area where we disagree. We think the problem is that those looking "long term "at Ford are only looking out till next year. Even then, consensus estimates are for $1.92, We believe investors in the company, not traders, should be looking at the company's plans for the next 5+ years. We see a company that is setting itself up on the global stage for significant international growth. We think that this choice of investing in itself, versus buying back stock, will pay off for shareholders with a much longer term view of the company. Investors have to remember that Ford is a multi year hold for us. While we were expecting a beat this quarter, we are encouraged by the company's revenue numbers, and we see the same type of strength in areas that we saw for General Motors. The company's decision to spend its capital on continued investments in itself, as opposed to going out and buying back stock, could have been the difference maker in the headline number. If Ford was buying back stock, it would have made the headline number. We're glad it didn't and that it's spending that capital on things like continued investments in smart cars in China. Once again we are left trying to determine if Ford's investments in itself now will pay off in the future. We believe that it will. Again, one of the nice things about holding Ford for the long term, is that it is going to continue to provide investors with a nice dividend yield that they can reinvest. F Dividend Yield (NYSE: TTM ) data by YCharts If you are bullish on the long term story the same way that we are, we do not mind compounding our dividends quarter over quarter while we hold onto our core shares. We remain encouraged by this quarter's results, and we continue to believe that Ford is on the right track. The market got this one wrong, and we continue to be long.
