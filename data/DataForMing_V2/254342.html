10 More Reasons Why AMD Will Be $10 In 2017 - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) | Seeking Alpha Graphics market share coming back incrementally. $320 million in cash coming soon from Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics deal. I have previously written about reasons to buy Advance Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) for a multi-bagger gain in 10 Reasons Why AMD Will Be $10 By 2017 and AMD: This Intel Ankle-Biter Is On Its Way To Substantial Profits . My basic argument is AMD is priced for failure - even bankruptcy - and this gives investors an opportunity to make a lot of money in the next two years or so. The longer AMD survives the more likely the huge gain in price is coming. In October, AMD announced an agreement with Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics for the sale of 85% of its SATS facilities for net cash of about $320 million. This gives AMD enough money to complete all the important product developments, especially the new Zen processor. See AMD: Cash Infusion Means It Is Time To Buy This Beleaguered Laggard for more on the subject. Sony (NYSE: SNE ) just announced that sales of PlayStation 4 have exceeded 30 million units. Although Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) has not announced unit sales of Xbox One, it is certainly on an upward trajectory too. Increased game console sales adds more viability to AMD's future growth. And it looks like AMD will be adding Nintendo ( OTCPK:NTDOY ) to its game console stable. For the first time in at least a decade, AMD will be on the same production node as Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ). CEO Lisa Su has announced that two products have been taped out for 14NM production in 2016. This means, for example, that AMD will be making a big leap in technology from the 28NM Carrizo chip to the Zen's 14NM FinFET and will immediately be much more competitive in the CPU and GPU market. This should result in market share gains beginning in 2017. Per CEO Lisa Su, on AMD's Q3 2015 earnings conference call , more custom SoC contracts have been signed and will start generating revenue in 2016. This is in addition to the game consoles SoC: Yes, so the way I would think about the enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom segment in terms of longer-term revenue growth, in 2016, as we said, we will have additional semi-custom revenue ramping in the second half of 2016, so I think that would be one driver. Rumors have it Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is looking to AMD for a custom x86 SoC for 2017. Obviously, you must take all rumors with a huge grain of salt, but if this one comes true AMD's stock price will zoom. Why would Apple switch from Intel to AMD? How about custom design to Apple's specs (CPU and GPU) similar to the iPhone, lower cost compared to Intel and a future choice of x86 or ARM. Of course, the whole thing, including the rumor, could just be a negotiating ploy by Apple to get a better price from Intel. Time will tell. For the last few quarters, AMD has been losing GPU market share to Intel and NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA ). However, it looks like market share has increased marginally in Q3 and on increasing GPU sales too. AMD shipments increased by 16% quarter to quarter. This is certainly a big step up from ever decreasing unit sales seen in the previous quarters. And the latest AMD add-in-board (AIB), the R9 Nano, has received rave reviews . The steady lowering of SG&A expenses over the last five quarters is a big plus for future profits. And the sale of the SATS facilities will lower it even more in 2016. In addition, CAPEX should decrease also after the sale closes. Since the taping has begun on Zen (see above), you can reasonably expect the Zen desktop chipset to at least be available for testing in 2016. To me this is the single biggest event in the last 10 years for AMD. With the Zen capabilities certainly matching at least the low and medium range of Intel chips and possibly the highest, Zen should allow AMD to capture the biggest market share of desktops (and later servers) since the Athlon was released in 1999. As a personal observation, I looked through all the Christmas ads for PCs and laptops over Thanksgiving, and of the 37 ads I saw, 36 were Intel and only one was AMD. That says it all about the current state of affairs and I am confident the Zen chip will change that come 2017. CEO Dr. Lisa Su has impressed me with her leadership and determination. To be honest, I was not completely enamored when Su took over the helm of AMD. I am not a big fan of engineers as CEOs because, in my experience, business leadership skills are very different from technical skills and they are seldom found in the same person. I think perhaps Dr. Su is one of the exceptions. She has been relentlessly focused on developing products that can be sold and delivered now as opposed to years from now. She has cut costs and raised needed cash from the sale of the SATS facilities. And her calm and professional demeanor adds an air of confidence to her presentations. I will reserve final judgment until 2017. Who would buy or make a large investment in AMD? Well, anyone looking for semi-custom SoC capabilities with high IP content, such as the game consoles or Zen and GPUs. Add in membership in the x86 duopoly (along with Intel of course) and this is a very interesting company on the cusp of a big breakout in revenue and profits. How about Tsinghau Group, the Chinese company that recently invested $6 billion in Western Digital (NASDAQ: WDC ) and enabled WDC to take over SanDisk (NASDAQ: SNDK )? Tsinghau also made a $23 billion bid for Micron (NASDAQ: MU ) and recently announced it would build a $13 billion fab in China to enhance China's position in the integrated circuits market. In total, Tsinghau has $47 billion to spend, and making x86 and semi-custom chips in China may have a lot of appeal. Interestingly, Tsinghau has a $1.5 billion joint venture with Intel related to Spreadtrum and RDA Microelectronics. And, no, cross licensing of x86 IP would not be a problem as explained here by AMD. I have often been asked why I like AMD so much more than Intel. The reasons are many, but the biggest one is the huge upside of AMD over the next two years. I think, barring a buyout, AMD has an excellent chance to be a four-bagger by the end of 2017. Intel, on the other hand, has a driver in 3D XPoint, but other than that, it will at best be a mediocre investment over the next two years. And I am not sure exactly what profits will be generated over that time period unless 3DX ramps up to high-profit volume a lot faster than it looks like it will. With Intel's management projecting a pedestrian "mid-single digits" revenue increase in 2016 (the same as their 2015 projections), it is difficult to see a huge price increase anytime in the next two years. In all other areas, Intel has companies such as Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ), ARM (ARM), Xilinx (NASDAQ: XLNX ) and, yes, AMD gunning for its high margin products. In any event, I don't see how Intel can be even a double by 2017 while AMD most certainly will be, and more, if it just delivers what is in its house right now. Obviously, Intel is the much safer bet with its generous dividend, huge cash flows and its semi-monopolies in desktop and server chips. But for my money, I will ride with AMD for the potential for huge capital gains by the end of 2017. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
