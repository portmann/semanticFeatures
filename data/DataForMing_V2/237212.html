2016 Will Be Apple's Biggest Year - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Supply check worries have Apple shares declining. I believe Apple will continue to set new corporate records. Last week, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) lost more than 7.20%. Credit Suisse issued a negative note regarding supply checks, and a lot of panic ensued regarding iPhone sales during the company's fiscal 2016 period. This resulted in a number of negative Apple articles, including one from fellow SA contributor Alex Cho, who detailed why he thought the year wouldn't be Apple's best . I disagree with some of his points, and I think investors are overreacting a bit to one analyst note. In this article, I detail why I still believe Apple can have a decent year. Let me start with the Credit Suisse note. I think this is just part of the usual rhetoric regarding Apple. With dozens of analysts covering the stock, not everyone is going to say something positive all the time. About a year ago, we saw a similar note out of Pac Crest, believing iPhone growth had peaked and demand had been pulled forward. Apple continued strong iPhone growth throughout the year, with management discussing conversion rates continuing to rise. Don't forget, Credit Suisse reiterated an Outperform rating and $140 price target with this "negative" note, and that implies nearly 25% upside from Friday's closing price. Apple shares had rallied almost 35% from their August low, so perhaps the stock was due for a pullback. In regard to Mr. Cho's piece, he makes a number of very logical arguments, but I disagree with him in regards to the iPhone. Even if the company doesn't show that much growth in unit sales during calendar Q4 (fiscal Q1), I don't see the fiscal year being as weak as he believes. I still believe there is a massive upgrade opportunity, which management continues to detail. Also, I do think the launch of a 4-inch phone sometime during the spring of 2016 will provide a late fiscal year boost to iPhone sales. I also believe that we'll see strong growth in markets like India, where Apple is looking to substantially boost sales. Even in a worst case scenario, I don't see fiscal year unit sales of the smartphone dipping below 225 million, compared to the 231.2 million seen in fiscal 2015 . As seen in the table below, IDC shows how Apple still has tremendous global growth potential in terms of smartphone market share. My biggest disagreement overall is when it comes to average selling prices of the iPhone. Alex has an ASP of $640 for the year, down about $30 from what Apple recorded in fiscal 2015. Even if Apple does launch a smaller phone, which probably won't be as expensive, I don't see it impacting ASPs in a dramatic fashion. Apple did not upgrade the storage size in this year's iPhones, which means many of the newer buyers have to go with larger storage (more expensive) options if they want to fully utilize all of the phone's features. I believe iPhone selling prices will at least be stable, and could in fact see slight upside as the company has tried to combat the issue of a stronger dollar. Between the iPad and Mac, I don't see any major differences in our forecasts. I'm a little more positive on the Mac line, because I still believe in Apple gaining some market share. I do believe we'll see a further decline in iPad unit sales, with the size of the drop based on when Apple refreshes the iPad Air. Average selling prices will bounce thanks to the more expensive Pro, and we'll see additional revenues from the new device's accessories. When it comes to everything else, I believe that there is some upside from Alex's forecast. We'll have a full year of Apple Watch sales, including this year's holiday period, compared to less than two quarters in fiscal 2015. Also, I think Apple Music can provide at least one or two billion in yearly revenues, with the actual number depending on how quickly the service is rolled out in more international markets. I also see Apple launching its streaming TV service in a couple of months, which also should provide a small boost to Apple TV sales. Apple will be hurt if the dollar continues to rally, although the quarterly comparisons are getting somewhat better as we enter 2016. With lots of recent product launches in the rear view mirror, I think the recent surge in R&D spending will subside a bit, providing slight room for operating margin improvement. While I'm not as positive on gross margins as Mr. Cho, I don't think he added in any "other income" items, which have averaged more than $1.1 billion over the past three fiscal years. In the end, these are my current forecasts for Apple's key items: Unit sales (millions): iPhone - 225; Mac - 21; iPad - 47. Total revenues of $241.2 billion. Gross margins of 40.00%. The headline numbers would represent yearly records for Apple, although my forecast is a little below what analysts are currently expecting . The main difference is most likely due to my iPhone forecast, which is a little weaker than the street expects. However, I still think selling prices will do well, and I think new products/services have a bit more potential than most realize. In Mr. Cho's article, he gave Apple a 13X multiple on his EPS forecast, a price target of $116.34. My forecast calls for higher revenues and earnings, so I think a higher number, say 13.5X, is completely justified. That gives me a price target of $131.30, which is below the street average but quite reasonable in my opinion. My valuation implies that Apple's multiple expands by about two points. I see Apple with a solid dividend raise in Spring 2016, especially if rising interest rates lead the company to scale back a little on the buyback. I also think investors will start to buy the stock ahead of the iPhone 7 launch, which I think will return the smartphone to growth. Next year, the upgrade program will start reducing the length upgrade cycle, and I think that Apple could launch the program on other devices in an effort to drive sales. Apple shares lost more than 7% in the past week, primarily thanks to one negative analyst note. We've seen this story before, and a number of other analysts came out and defended Apple. I don't think we'll see as weak of a year for Apple as some expect, primarily in the case of the iPhone and its ASPs. In the end, I see Apple reporting another record year, which I believe will ultimately send shares of the company back towards their all-time highs.
