Apple could pursue details about FBI iPhone hack - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Mar 30 2016, 02:59 ET | About: Apple Inc. (AAPL) | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) may have the chance to return a punch thrown by the FBI, by using a Brooklyn drug case to force the government to reveal how it hacked into the iPhone belonging to one of the San Bernardino shooters. Questions are still lingering over how the FBI found a backdoor into the device, but the agency reportedly hired Israeli-firm Cellebrite for technical assistance in accessing the phone. Shares in the cybersecurity company's Japan-listed parent, Sun Corp., have leapt more than 60% since the hack was first publicized. Apple should pursue this.  There is a "need to know" principal as it has the potential to negate their advertising and make iPhones not fit for purpose.  If people have confidential financial information that could influence stock markets then markets could be thrown into turmoil by such a hack as the FBI seem to have performed. If Apple was cooperative there would be no hack. If terrorist phone contained possible info of a Silicon Valley ceo kidnapping, what do you think they would do. Well, if Apple doesn't use the precedent, this will confirm my suspicions that it was Apple itself who secretly aided FBI to get out of this slippery situation and keep their face. We shall see soon. The security on the i phone is a joke.  If they don't understand their own vulnerability like the number theory pHds at the NSA, then they have too many artsy employees and a derth of tech competent people.   I would be very embarassed, as they definitely will be in a few years when their phones can't access the Samsung network of 900 communications satellites.
