Ford: Why The European Comeback Will Continue - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford has made an impressive comeback in Europe, consolidating its number two position and outpacing the industry's growth so far this year. Ford has been cutting its losses in Europe at an aggressive pace, with its loss expected to go down to $250 million this year from $1 billion last year. Ford has a strong pipeline of new vehicles to be launched in Europe this year, including the iconic Mustang, along with facelifts, which will help it sustain the momentum. Ford's investment in plant capacity in Spain will allow it to churn out more types of vehicles from a single point, thereby helping it reduce costs. Ford (NYSE: F ) has made an impressive recovery in Europe in the past couple of years. Back in 2012 , Ford was struggling in Europe on account of an economic crisis, which had decimated the company's profitability in the region due to weak vehicle sales. But things have changed for the better, as Ford's sales in Europe have increased just over 7% in the past two years. Now, European sales account for close to 22% of Ford's overall wholesale unit volumes. Thus, this is a key market for Ford, which is why we will be taking a closer look at Ford's performance and position in Europe. Ford is performing very well in Europe this year. It has shown positive growth in each of the first five months of 2015. Overall, it sold 542,000 vehicles in Europe till the end of May, an increase of 9.26% over last year's 496,049 units sold for the same period. In comparison, the growth of the auto industry in Europe so far this year stands at 6.9% up to May. Thus, it is evident that Ford is outpacing the industry's growth in Europe. Ford's robust performance this year is the result of strong demand for its all-new and updated models that it has launched recently. For instance, Ford launched the all-new Mondeo late last year. This upgraded version is selling well with a 75% rise in sales year-over-year. Meanwhile, the new Focus ST model contributed 4,700 units to sales in May, an increase of 45% from last year. Additionally, the Ford Fiesta has remained the best selling small car of Europe over the last 3 years, and the trend is continuing this year too as sales are up by 23% than last May. Additionally, Ford has done well in the commercial vehicle segment as well, clinching the number 2 spot among the best-selling commercial vehicle brands in Europe year-to-date. In this segment, Ford has expanded its Transit range of vehicles that now includes the Transit, Transit Custom, Transit Connect, and Transit Courier. Ford's total commercial vehicle sales were up 16% in May and 36% year-to-date, and the company now holds 12.7% market share of commercial vehicles in Europe, an improvement of 2.5 percentage points over last year's first five months. One of the big reasons behind Ford's success in Europe is that it is selling in higher value sales channels, which include private retail and fleet segments. These together accounted for 72% of its passenger car sales in the first five months of the year. Thus, Ford is making the right moves in Europe by improving its sales and market share. Ford was losing its hold on the European market year after year since 2009. In 2009, its market share was 8.9%, while at the end of 2012, it was down to 7.5%. For the next two years, it remained flat, showing signs of a possible trend reversal. This year, the company seems to have made a comeback as Ford's market share has jumped to 8.1% for the five months of 2015. This is shown below: In fact, Ford is ahead of everyone in Europe except Volkswagen (OTCQX: VLKAY ), which is slightly ahead with a market share of 11.7% at the end of Q1 2015. The next two competitors are a safe distance behind Ford, and have lost market share this year, while the American automaker has improved. Thus, Ford could consolidate its second position in Europe going forward. In fact, even Volkswagen is losing market share in Europe this year, while Ford is gaining. This is shown below: Sales of vehicles in Europe have rebounded with stronger-than-expected volume growth. More importantly, Ford has outpaced the industry's growth. However, a profit still remains elusive for the company in Europe. The main reason that Automotive News Europe cites is the heavy fixed costs and huge price reductions required to sell higher volumes in the continent. Additionally, there is excess capacity for automobile production in Europe. This has added to Ford's costs and reduced pricing power. In fact, Ford had lost $4 billion in Europe from 2012 to 2014, but the good thing is that the trend is improving. The company lost $1 billion last year, and expects to lose another $250 million for 2015. Thus, it is evident that the Blue Oval is cutting its losses in Europe at a good pace. In order to consolidate its position in Europe, Ford has invested $2.6 billion in the continent, beginning with Spain in 2011. It has cut its manufacturing operations elsewhere in Europe and reduced the workforce to combat losses. This investment has helped Ford set up a manufacturing complex in Valencia, Spain, which is key to its restructuring efforts. This plant will have a capacity of making 450,000 units per year, which is one of the largest of all Ford facilities. It will have a flexible line to accommodate 6 different vehicles this year. Thus, at a lower cost, Ford will be able to churn out more quantity and types of vehicles in Europe with the help of this plant. Ford Europe had already announced earlier in 2015 that this is going to be one of its busiest years in terms of new product launches. The company is going to launch a range of all-new as well as face-lifted vehicles this year. For instance, the all new Ford Galaxy seven passenger vehicle will hit the European market somewhere in the mid-year. Other new models that would go on sale include the all-new S-MAX, C MAX, Grand C-MAX, and C-MAX Energi plug-in hybrid electric vehicle that launches first in the Netherlands. In addition, the all-new Edge SUV will go into production in late 2015. The all-new Ford Mustang will be sold for the first time in Europe after completing 50 years of existence. In fact, 5,000 customers have already ordered the new version of Mustang that goes on sale in Europe this summer. Thus, Ford will be flooding the market with a number of models this year, apart from face-lifting existing models, and this will allow the company to sustain its momentum in this market. Ford has made a tremendous comeback in Europe on the back of new model introductions and a smart restructuring. Looking ahead, the company has a strong pipeline, which will help it get better in Europe. Also, the company's restructuring is leading to a drop in its losses in Europe. Thus, in my opinion, Ford will continue getting better in Europe going forward, and since the market accounts for more than a fifth of its sales, it will have a positive impact on its financial performance.
