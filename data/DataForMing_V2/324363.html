"It Just Occurred To Me" - Trump Proposes Boycott Of Apple, While Tweeting From An iPhone | Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! Authored by Steve H.

Moments after AAPL announced on Wednesday that it would not comply with FBI demands to hack into its phone, Donald Trump was already arguing vehemently that Apple should help investigators crack the phoneâ€™s encryption system: "To think that Apple won't allow us to get into her cell phone," Trump said on Fox and Friends Wednesday morning. â€œWho do they think they are? No, we have to open it up." "Apple, this is one case, this is a case that certainly we should be able to get into the phone," he said. "And we should find out what happened, why it happened, and maybe there's other people involved and we have to do that." "I agree 100% with the courts," the mogul added. "In that case, we should open it up. I think security over all â€” we have to open it up, and we have to use our heads. We have to use common sense." And then, moments ago during a campaign event in Pawleys Island, South Carolina, Trump had an epiphany: "It just occurred to me." His solution: a boycott of Apple Inc products until the tech giant agrees to U.S. government demands that it unlock the cellphone of the San Bernardino killer. "Boycott Apple until they give up the information," Trump said. "The phone is owned by the government... Tim Cook is looking to do a big number probably to show how liberal he is. Apple should give up." The billionaire's call to action followed an interview with Bloomberg in which he offered harsh words for Cook. "Tim Cook is living in the world of the make believe," Trump said Friday in a telephone interview. "I would come down so hard on him -- you have no idea -- his head would be spinning all of the way back to Silicon Valley." "I think Tim Cook is totally out of line and I think the government should come down on Tim Cook very, very hard," Trump said in the interview Friday. "I think it's a disgrace what he is doing, we're talking about lives, potentially thousands of lives, and we should find out who else was involved in the plot where 14 people were killed." It was unclear initially it Trump had a specific cell phone company as an alternatives, or if this was all part of a grand marketing ploy by Tim Cook to get Trump's opponents to rush out and purchase iPhones in retaliation. We will keep an eye on channels checks over the next few days for the answer. Update: less than an hour later, Trump appears to have realized his error by tweeting from a Google-based platform, the same Google which supports Apple in its fight with the government: Fri, 02/19/2016 - 16:13 | 7208812 Kreditanstalt Fri, 02/19/2016 - 16:18 | 7208839 The Juggernaut Fri, 02/19/2016 - 16:20 | 7208855 ToSoft4Truth Fri, 02/19/2016 - 16:21 | 7208864 OrangeJews If they use say AT&T, they can get the phone numbers from the phone  company.  Emails?  I haven't heard of Google or Yahoo in the news not  giving up Email accounts.  This just doesn't make sense. Fri, 02/19/2016 - 16:28 | 7208895 Say What Again This is almost as good as the Kon-Yeah tweet to zucerberg to fund his projects.  As a reminder, Zuckerberg runs FaceBook Fri, 02/19/2016 - 16:37 | 7208923 Zoomorph Dead Islamic terrorists have no rights. No right to privacy. The government owns their phone and should use it if it helps catch their accomplices. Just like the government can search their house, they can search their phone. Do ZH commentors seriously disagree with this? Are ZHers seriously making this into a big issue and going to stop supporting Trump because of it? Isn't immigration the biggest issue of this election? Don't we all know that Apple is already in cahoots with the government and this is a publicity stunt on their part? ZH has always been anti-Trump. No coverage of his 9/11 conspiracy remarks or anything else. Only focus on one tiny issue and blow it into something big. Typical dishonest reporting. - We need to open the 28 page document to find out what happened What happens? You'll quickly be directed to another candidate's website: Donald Trump's. As it turns out, the Bush campaign doesn't own jebbush.com. The domain  name is owned by a company called Fabulous.com Pty Ltd., an Australian  company that helps people monetize their internet domain names.  The  site was apparently created on Nov. 19, 1997 and updated on Oct. 20,  2015, according to a domain registration search. Fri, 02/19/2016 - 17:08 | 7209111 Say What Again He is going to use his Apple, to tell everyone to boycott Apple? That is the joke here. If it is a publicity stunt as you say, Trump is buying into it. ZH posts all kinds of pro-Trump stuff too, you're the one being dishonest. They are neutral to slightly sympathetic, but they support no one (except Ron Paul). They support giving this corrupt system shit (they like when Trump does that). Fri, 02/19/2016 - 16:56 | 7209051 SirRobin While I'm fine with unlocking the phone, giving the gov the codes to do it is not part of the deal.  There is a process for that its called a warrant and if they have one Tim should unlock the phone and give them the data.  This seems pretty clear Don Don making statements that he will use government resources like a mob boss, is not helpful to his conservative position.  This is inspite of the fact that this is currently standard operating procedure for most agencies.   Business as usual...The Donald should fit right in. Fri, 02/19/2016 - 17:05 | 7209097 Citxmech Fri, 02/19/2016 - 16:58 | 7209067 Demdere Last thing Trump said about 9/11 that I attended to was the bit about "1000s of dancing Muslims".  Right after that, AIPAC decided Trump was a great guy, Presidential debates treated him like an actual candidate, and MSM gave him even more time, ran his ads free all the time to show the people what Trump was doing. The dancers, of course, were Mossad agents, as a result of which we know the names of the Mossad agents who transported and set the explosives in the WTC complex.  All those buildings were gutted, not just the 3. Fri, 02/19/2016 - 17:09 | 7209117 SirRobin Yep, Donald has never commented on Audit the Fed, the SEC etc...  its unclear what he really stands for (other than his own ego and self promotion).  In addition to what big players are supporting him to you point. Fri, 02/19/2016 - 16:53 | 7209039 Demdere Yes, it doesn't make sense.  That is because the Feds are intentionally confusing 2 different issues, so people like Trump say dumb things like that. First issue, Apple, help us get into that phone for reason of national security. To which Apple properly says "But, you see, we can't, because our very best security people designed and implemented the hardware so that we can't.  It is a sales point in foreign countries, all the places that killed electronic sales because of the backdoors you guys put into everyone else's devices." Second issue, Apple, put a backdoor into your system so that we can see into the phone for reasons of national security.  Oh, yes, it would be good to be able to do that at any time without the user knowing. To which every security professional says "That would be dumb.  Look at your record of keeping secrets! Snowdon's most important info was that you guy's can't keep secrets, we certainly should not assume Snowdon was the first, certainly should assume that the Chinese and Russians have read everything.  Teenagers read your director's email accounts.  OMB's databases.  The whole government is vulnerable to hackers and spies, and we are supposed to give you more secrets to keep?"

Fri, 02/19/2016 - 16:36 | 7208947 NihilistZero He's playing the political game.   The tough talk is his shtick and he's gotta stay on message.  I doubt Trump sincerely believes any of the truly outlandish things he says.  The  positions page on his website has his tax plan in detail (which is spectacular and could get us a step or 2 from repealing the income tax completely on individuals), the border security stuff and trade/foreign policy.  All the rest is window dressing to keep him perpetually in the new cycle.  Every politician does it, Trump just used his existing celebrity to perfect it. Wrong. Ron Paul never did it. Fuck this country for not electing the closest thing we ever had to Cato the Younger. Fri, 02/19/2016 - 16:48 | 7209008 ejmoosa Let's see what happens when Trump finds out that Apple has had back doors in for years, and taht the feds have always had access. Like many Americans, he may believe this tragicomedy at the moment.  But sooner or later we all will see the truth. Fri, 02/19/2016 - 17:09 | 7209115 1033eruth I'll admit he says some stupid things, but that's not against the law until IDIOTS make it against the law.  Fri, 02/19/2016 - 16:18 | 7208837 t0mmyBerg Yeah I am actually now looking into buying my first iPhone.  And also less likely to vote Trump.  Maybe I will vote for that crazy bastard McAfee.  Or maybe I just will not vote at all. Fri, 02/19/2016 - 16:21 | 7208857 Pheonyte If Trump ever had my vote (he didn't), he'd have just lost it. Shove it up your statist ass Donald. Fri, 02/19/2016 - 16:30 | 7208904 Say What Again I have no doubt that McAfee and a few of his buddies could crack that phone in less than 24 hours Fri, 02/19/2016 - 16:37 | 7208941 peddling-fiction Fri, 02/19/2016 - 16:48 | 7209009 richinSpirit Fri, 02/19/2016 - 16:55 | 7209049 yellensNIRPles Yeah, this fucks with me hardcore. I was going to vote for Trump just to tell TPTB to suck it, but this is his official embrace of TPTB. This is a clear violation of 4th Amendment rights, since what .GOV wants is the backdoor to ALL iphones. It isn't just about this one phone. They can get that information and Apple should give it to them, but Apple should NOT be forced to give our government a backdoor to our own security. Like many here have warned in the past, Trump wants to fuck you before he's even in office and he's finally showing it. Bad news. Although the concept that any one person can fix our fucked up system is laughable in the first place this is sad. I was really, truly hoping Trump would get this right but he's screwing the pooch as they say.  Fri, 02/19/2016 - 16:39 | 7208861 peddling-fiction Fri, 02/19/2016 - 17:00 | 7209073 TradingIsLifeBrah Fri, 02/19/2016 - 16:40 | 7208968 SirRobin Agree, its a sad state of affairs.  The people could have backed Rand but instead choose a former??? liberal blow hard because they had seen him on their mindless idiot box a few times.  Run Away Run Away!!!!

They read a single negative article about him and now they're all against him. Whimsical fools. They gobble up whatever Tyler feeds them (mostly crappy articles). Fri, 02/19/2016 - 16:57 | 7209062 MsCreant ZHers are not "all" anything. If you spend time around here you know that. I have been anti-Trump all along. So have a number of posters here. Lots of folks like him too.  Fri, 02/19/2016 - 16:34 | 7208932 jomama Fri, 02/19/2016 - 16:37 | 7208952 Mr Pink I'll vote for Trump if there is at least a 1% chance he blows the lid off the 9/11 cover-up Fri, 02/19/2016 - 16:52 | 7209030 t0mmyBerg Apple is not protecting trash like you only lettered accounts. Are you saying that Apple will lose sales selling your info to anyone who pays or only to those Trump inc. pays.
