Fantasy trading: If Apple were listed in the Dow Sustained dominanceÂ has turned Apple into a cultural force.Â Imagining what the tech behemoth could do, buy or influenceÂ with its vast hordes of cash has become something of aÂ parlor game.Â After a record-setting first quarter Â yielded $74.6 billion in revenue and a quarterly net profit of $18 billion,Â  Kristen Scholer blogged for the Wall Street journal : Also standing at record levels: Appleâ€™s cash and marketable securities. That figure ballooned to $178 billion last quarter, up from $155 billion in the prior period. With that money, Apple could: 1) Buy Merck, which had a market value of $175 billion at Wednesdayâ€™s close; or 2) Purchase the bottom 38 companies in the S&P 500 by market cap for a total of $174 billion; or All of this success has been great for holders of Nasdaq or S&P 500 index fundsâ€”both indices include Appleâ€”but what if the company’s stock were listed elsewhere?Â  Using this interactive Reuters graphic ,Â substitute Apple for any one of the 30 stocksÂ that comprise the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and track how differently the index would have recently fared. Spoiler: likely better. AsÂ  Rodrigo Campos and Chuck Mikolajczak write for Reuters , “If Apple had replaced a badly lagging stock such as IBM, which has dropped more than 13Â percent since Appleâ€™s split, the Dow would now be about 450Â points higher than its Friday close at 18132.70 (and have gained 9.8 percentÂ rather than the 7.1 percent increase it has recorded, without dividends).” We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion, anecdotes, links and data.
