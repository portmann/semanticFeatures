Fitbit IPO: Fears Over Apple Watch Competition Will Prove Unfounded - Fitbit (Pending:FIT) | Seeking Alpha Fitbit aims for a conservative $3 billion valuation in its upcoming IPO. The introduction of the Apple Watch is considered a key risk for future growth. However, Apple Watch customers are not likely to use their 'toy' for fitness tracking. Fitbit has also a competitive pricing advantage over the Apple Watch. One of the most exciting IPO's this year is the IPO of wearable fitness device company Fitbit (Pending: FIT ). The San Francisco-based company sells activity trackers and wireless-enabled wearable devices that measure all sorts of data. Fitbit has also a very active online community and offers a premium subscription service to its customers, including personal training, a nutritionist and sleep consultant. In my opinion, the combination of both the sale of devices and premium subscriptions is one of the key financial advantages of Fitbit compared to the company's competition. An in-depth analyses of the company's business, competitors and financial performance can be found in this article by contributor West Coast Growth Picks. Fitbit's IPO is not like any other tech-related IPO. Unlike recent IPO's (e.g. the IPO of GoPro (NASDAQ: GPRO )), Fitbit actually is looking for a conservative valuation. According to this report, Fitbit aims for a $3 billion valuation. I find this valuation conservative considering the company's strong growth in the first quarter of 2015 (see prospectus ). Fitbit will begin trading below 3 times projected net sales and 15 times projected earnings per share. As a result, the company will be valued in the same category as another fitness wearable competitor Garmin (NASDAQ: GRMN ). This seems to make sense. However, Fitbit posted much stronger growth numbers compared to Garmin and has a market share of 34% compared to just 6% for Garmin (see this report ). The most important reason for Fitbit's conservative valuation is likely the fear among investors that the introduction of Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) smartwatch will diminish Fitbit's growth potential. Fitbit fueled this fear by pointing at the introduction of the Apple Watch as one of the key risk factors in its IPO documentation. In April, Apple launched its Apple Watch and according to this article demand was very high. The high popularity of the Apple Watch will probably not ease the fear among investors. The Apple Watch has several features to track fitness performances and health data. As a result, some of Fitbit's potential customers may pass on buying a Fitbit fitness tracker, because they already own an Apple Watch. From this perspective, I can understand the logic of the Apple Watch being an important competitor for Fitbit's high-end products. However, this impact is likely to be limited. The Apple Watch should be considered as a luxury item. This is also reflected by the premium retail price of the Apple Watch compared to Fitbit's products. The strong demand in April is very likely caused by the high degree of loyalty by Apple's customers and not so much demand for another fitness- and health wearable device. Since I consider the Apple Watch a luxury item, the question is whether customers are likely to use this watch for tracking their fitness performance. I find that it is very unlikely, because customers will be careful with their new high-tech 'toy'. Compare it with buying a brand new premium car, for example a Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ). Changes are slim that customers will go out for a rally ride soon after the car is delivered. In my opinion, demand for fitness trackers will not drop significantly following the introduction of the Apple Watch. According to Forbes' columnist Dan Diamond, the introduction of the Apple Watch should help Fitbit in the short term. He stated: Apple's entry into the wearable market will likely help Fitbit in the short-term, by increasing awareness and interest. Especially because Fitbit devices cost a fraction of Apple's watches: Fitbit prices range from $59 to $249, while the Apple Watch entry price is $350 (source: Forbes ). Especially the cost advantage of Fitbit will prove very competitive as 43% of fitness tracker customers earn less than $50,000 per year (source: Broadcom ). For most potential customers, the cheaper Fitbit tracker seems much more affordable than the Apple Watch. This will moderate the effect of the Apple Watch introduction as well. In my opinion, the introduction of the Apple Watch will not have a significant effect on Fitbit's growth potential. First of all, customers are less likely to exposure their luxury Apple Watch to outdoor elements and fitness activities. Second, Fitbit has a pricing advantage over the Apple Watch. This will prove very helpful, especially retaining younger customers earning less than $50,000 per year. Therefore, I am very bullish on Fitbit's growth potential in the next three to five years. According to Juniper Research, the market for fitness trackers will triple by 2018 compared to 2014 (source: Juniper ). With a market share of 34%, Fitbit will be able to benefit from the higher demand for fitness trackers. Considering my arguments above, Fitbit's upcoming IPO is very interesting for investors. Fitbit aims for a conservative valuation of less than 3 times projected revenue and 15 times earnings per share. This is comparable with navigation service provider Garmin. However, Fitbit should be able to grow revenue and earnings per share at a much faster pace than Garmin in the upcoming years, even considering the introduction of the Apple Watch. Therefore, I find that Fitbit is poised to outperform both Garmin and the market after the company's IPO.
