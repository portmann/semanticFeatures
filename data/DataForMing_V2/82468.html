Has Apple Made Pandora A Buy? - Pandora Media (NYSE:P) | Seeking Alpha Apple Music set to come out June 30th, but high price point may make competition difficult. P shares dip on expected competition from AAPL in music streaming, but does that make the stock a buy? P financials still show net losses despite growing ad revenue and listening hours, but geotargeting has helped the company stem the red ink. Remember when the mere mention of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) jumping into a new industry sent shivers down the spines of startups and dominant players in the market? On June 8, Apple sought to take its talents to the growing music streaming business with Apple Music. While investors initially responded to the news through a sell-off of would-be rival Pandora (NYSE: P ) shares, most in the industry shrugged off Apple as just another competitor in a crowded industry. Some have also speculated that Apple Music is more to push hardware sales then a meaningful attempt to disrupt music streaming, especially since it provides very little that's new and it will be competing with free services. Streaming music has continued to grow in popularity, with over 135 million subscribers across the industry with further growth expected over the next few years. However, only 18 million of these subscribers actually pay for subscriptions, which in the case of a company like Pandora, just entitles the listener to ad-free content rather than better quality streams. With Apple Music expected to go on sale for $10/month or $15 for a "family plan", it is entering a market where free is expected and subscriptions are just an added bonus. Moreover, going off the announcement made at the Worldwide Developers' Conference, there aren't many distinguishing characteristics that separate the service from its competitors aside from the emphasis on human lists vs. computer- and data-driven lists. Apple will likely bank on its decade-long relationship with major record labels and its larger library of music compared to Pandora, as well as instant availability on Apple devices with a three-month trial period, but it is unclear whether this will be enough to get people to pay for something they could get for free elsewhere. Despite Pandora founder Tim Westergren repeating his lead talking point about how there is "room in the market" for multiple streamers (which sounds more like a way to keep Pandora's investors on side and stave off the inevitable stock dip that comes with news of a new entrant), analysts have found that there is really only need for one stream at a time for music, and Apple Music is entering the game very late. According to industry research group MusicWatch , Pandora and Spotify combine for over 60% of streaming listeners on the iPhone, compared to only 21% for iTunes Radio, Apple Music's precursor. Moreover, iTunes Radio represents only 5% of listening hours. With such statistics working against Apple's favor on their own phone, competitors have a good reason not to be worried about losing business. In fact, it is as likely that Apple Music will cannibalize its own radio service listeners rather than win market share from Pandora or Spotify, the latter of which will soon be offering videos and podcasts available for streaming. Along with the congested market for listeners, there also isn't much room for profit off of streaming music. According to Pandora's recent quarterly earnings report, revenue grew YOY by 19%, along with a 23% growth in mobile revenue despite a $1 million drop in subscription revenue over the same time. Despite these improvements, which sent share prices as high as $18 due to the report, Pandora has not been able to record a yearly profit in the last two years, and has reported losses in seven of the last nine quarters, with Q1 2015 being the heaviest at over $45 million in net income losses. While Pandora's yearly losses have decreased, the fact that it is taking so long to make the streaming business profitable for a first-mover in the business should signal that the market might not be able to handle another entrant. Granted, this is likely going to be nothing more than a side project for Apple in the hopes of using Apple Music as a way to consolidate its ecosystem and keep more of its consumer data in-house, as some have theorized, but it would be uncharacteristic for Apple to make a big showing of a new product, at its marquee event, if it's meant to be a loss leader. How to invest in Apple's competitors With revenue increases for Apple appearing minimal for the music stream compared to its other products, and the difficulties it will space within its own ecosystem in gaining followers, it may be more worthwhile to look at its immediate competitors for potential investment opportunity. At the moment, Spotify ( if it ever actually becomes an IPO ) is the better streaming service from a financial perspective. Over 25% of its 60 million subscribers pay the $10 subscription fee for ad-free listening, and is venturing into live video and podcast, making it a real multi-entertainment platform. Until then though, Pandora will likely be worth watching. As expected, its share price dipped 3% the day after the WWDC, a slightly larger drop than the one experiences right after the announcement of iTunes Radio, which many thought would be a Pandora killer but has not come to pass. Pandora's financials are slowly improving thanks to more targeted advertising and mobile revenue growing along with mobile listening hours. It is still the leading dedicated music streamer on the market, and while it is nowhere near the hype-induced $40 mark it once got to, its Apple-inspired sell-off makes it a cheap pick-up with good upside despite Q1 losses. It's risky, and Westergren doesn't inspire confidence with his constant lets-all-play-nicely sound-bites, but there is enough upside to make Pandora a good play. Source: Has Apple Made Pandora A Buy?
