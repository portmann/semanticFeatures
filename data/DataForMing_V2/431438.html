Orlando Gunman Reportedly Scouted Disney World As Potential Target | Zero Hedge by Phoenix Capital... - Jun 13, 2016 8:49 AM by globalintelhub - Jun 13, 2016 12:27 AM by Knave Dave - Jun 13, 2016 1:27 AM Have you ever wondered why politicians make some immigration illegal and then turn a blind eye to illegal immigration wherever it is happening? by Tyler Durden - Jun 13, 2016 12:18 PM Despite being investigated by the FBI twice before Sunday's tragedy in 2013 and 2014, Orlando gunman Omar Mateen managed to legally buy weapons and scout various venues for his attack before the weekend's disaster at Pulse nightclub. Perhaps even more worrisome is that he recently scouted Walt Disney World as a potential target, a federal law enforcement source tells People magazine . Salman told federal authorities on Sunday that her husband had more recently been "scouting Downtown Disney and Pulse [nightclub] for attacks." Unlike the four Disney World theme parks, Downtown Disney, which was recently renamed Disney Springs, doesn't have security and bag check before entry. Metal detectors have been installed outside Magic Kingdom, Hollywood Studios, Animal Kingdom and Epcot since 2015 and guests are selected at random for screening.

Isn't that called conspiracy? onewayticket2 minitrue Jun 13, 2016 12:23 PM THIS is the issue.  WHERE ARE THE "MODERATE" muslims to stand up to this?  We get lip service from CAIR (if anyone actually believed the guy), but no ACTION. froze25 onewayticket2 Jun 13, 2016 12:27 PM Part of Jihad is being deceptive, so the Moderates if they exist may be truly good people or just being the deceptive arm of the Jihad.  Its hard to tell.  One thing we do know is that our President and Hillary are quick to blame the 2nd amendment and not the people that repeatedly do these acts. Buckaroo Banzai onewayticket2 Jun 13, 2016 12:31 PM No "moderate" Muslims stand up to this because "moderate" muslims are quite happy with the way things are going. The Koran admonishes the "moderate" muslim for his laziness and love of the easy life, and ranks the jihadist above him; but the Koran is also quite clear: the worst muslim is infinitely better that the best infidel.
