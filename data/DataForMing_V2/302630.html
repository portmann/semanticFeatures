Inc. Yahoo â€œis just not worth a candle unless, essentially, you got it at such a discounted price,â€? Diller said in an interview on â€œBloomberg Go.â€? The Web pioneer could also â€œstand aloneâ€? because it has about 1 billion monthly active users. â€œIf you canâ€™t make it through that, something is wrong,â€? he said. The discounted price that Diller might be looking for, according to Bloomberg , might be in the range of zero dollars. Yahooâ€™s main business — excluding the stakes in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan Corp. — could be worth zero or less, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. But Diller wasn’t satisfied to just ruin Marissa’s day by using a 16th Century idiom to piss all over what’s left of her company, he also felt compelled to stick with his rhetorical history lesson and use an analogy in which Yahoo is a sh!t-covered peasant toiling in the fields of its competitor. â€œAll of us are serfs on the land of Google,â€? Diller said. â€œI told Google, itâ€™s sensible to treat your serfs well. If you donâ€™t, they rise up, get on horses and kill you.â€?
