Boeing: Dividend Play For Global Economy - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Boeing recently announced a big order from a Chinese buyer and expects more orders from Asia and the Middle East. Boeing’s 2nd Quarter earnings announcement is due shortly and investors might be attracted to the stock given its high dividend yield and low valuation. We believe that a bet on Boeing is ultimately a bet on the Global Economy and that investors should therefore exercise caution when buying the stock. Farnborough and Second Quarter Earnings. Boeing (NYSE: BA ) was in the news recently, announcing at the Farnborough Air Show that it had received $3 Billion worth of orders from an unnamed Chinese buyer - most likely Xiamen Airlines - for 30 of its 737 planes. The aerospace and defense giant also expects a $4 Billion order for 30 planes from Donghai Airlines and possibly a 25- to 30- vehicle order from Qatar Airways. Boeing's busy Air Show schedule occurs against the backdrop of its looming earnings announcement in late July, when the company is expected to report 2nd Quarter income of $0.78/share on the back of $23.7 Billion in revenue. Dividend and Outlook. For the most part, 2016 has been a challenging year for Boeing: the company's first quarter earnings missed analyst estimates by $0.09/share and the stock is down by 9.5%. That performance is in contrast with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (of which Boeing is a component), which recently hit a record close and is up by 5.3% in 2016. A tepid global economy, which resulted in fewer new airplane orders and Boeing's own tepid results have driven the negative sentiment against the stock. With Boeing's stock down for the year, dividend investors are looking at a 3.3% annual dividend yield. This means that a $10,000 investment in Boeing will generate passive income of $330 a year. Given Boeing's high sensitivity to global macroeconomic trends and government spending, it can't be qualified as a defensive play so much as a macro bet: you buy Boeing when the outlook for the world economy is strong and governments are flush with tax revenues to spend on military orders. Boeing actually raised its dividend by nearly 20% in 2016 - adding to its run of double-digit dividend raises that began in 2014. With a Working Capital ratio of 2.56-to-1.00, which is considerably higher than its peer group's reading, Boeing has liquid resources to spare - and therefore the capacity to continue paying (and even raising) dividends. Indeed, in its most recent earnings release, Boeing indicated that it expects approximately $10 Billion in operating cash flow for 2016 - more than enough to cover dividend payments of around $700 million per quarter and chip away at the $10.5 Billion remaining in its stock buyback program. Boeing doesn't have much debt, carrying just under $10 Billion. Consequently, it paid only $73 million in interest during the last quarter - or around 10% of the amount it returned to investors as dividends. The reason why Boeing's Debt-to-Equity ratio is more than double its industry's is that similar to Dow components such as Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO ), McDonald's (NYSE: MCD ) and 3M (NYSE: MMM ), it has engaged in sizable stock repurchases over the years. This in turn has reduced its equity base and made its Debt-to-Equity ratio look unattractive. However, with its sizable operating cash flow and strong liquidity Boeing's debt is manageable and credit ratings agency Fitch recently affirmed Boeing's 'A' credit rating. For 2016, Boeing expects to report earnings of between $8.45 to $8.65/share, but analysts anticipate that its actual results will hew towards the lower end of this range. Despite this less-than-sunny outlook for Boeing's current prospects, analysts are forecasting that, over the next five years, Boeing's revenues will rise by over 10% a year - better than the 9% expected for its industry. A positive view regarding the pace of global output and interest in Boeing's newer offerings such as the 737 MAX are behind this positive outlook. Boeing's stock is trading at a trailing Price-Earnings ratio of 17.7x and a forward Price-Earnings ratio of 13.7x. Both these measures are lower than that for both the Dow and the S&P500 , suggesting that Boeing's shares are undervalued. Indeed, Boeing's trading ratio is also below that of its industry and that of the broader capital goods sector. Dividend investors looking for other reasons to buy Boeing will also note that, unlike a number of its fellow Dow Components which are trading close to their 52-week highs, Boeing is trading in the middle of its 52-week range - the stock has clearly not benefited greatly from the market's record-setting rally. That said, Boeing shares have rallied by 28% since hitting its 2016 low in mid-February when the markets were roiled by plummeting oil prices and fears of a global recession. It also remains to be seen what impact Brexit will have on Boeing's future prospects. In the immediate aftermath of the Leave vote, the UK government reaffirmed its order for 50 Apache helicopters and actually signed a new contract for 9 new P8 Maritime Patrol Aircraft. However, the long-term effects of Brexit are not yet apparent and is one headwind that will bear watching for Boeing. Another is China: the headline-grabbing deals Boeing announced at Farnborough were from Chinese airlines but the mainland's economy is in a decidedly soft spot . While advance orders from Chinese commercial carriers are a positive sign, the fact remains that these orders can be cancelled and very much depend on a Chinese economic recovery that has yet to gain traction . All things considered, the outlook for Boeing's shares is mixed. On the one hand, its shares are relatively undervalued and investors can expect a dividend that is among the highest of the Dow components. On the other hand, betting on Boeing is betting that the global economy will be in a much better place five years from now. We therefore recommend that investors take a cautious approach when investing with Boeing. In our view, the best strategy for the stock is to dollar cost-average and to mix that approach with heavy buying during market dips.
