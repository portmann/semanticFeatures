Verizon adds 1.5 million new monthly users; revenue beats estimates | Reuters Verizon Communications Inc on Thursday reported higher-than-expected revenue for the fourth quarter as heavy promotions helped it counter aggressive offers and discounts from rivals and win new users. Shares of the No. 1 U.S. wireless service provider, whose profit edged past analysts' estimates, rose 0.5 percent to $44.65 in premarket trading. At Wednesday's close, the stock was down about 4 percent this year. Verizon added a net 1.5 million wireless retail postpaid, or monthly, subscriptions in the quarter, below 2 million a year earlier but exceeding the analysts' average estimate of 1.42 million, according to market research firm FactSet StreetAccount. The company, which is known for its high-quality network, withstood stiff competition from rivals in the saturated U.S. wireless market. Competition typically mounts in the fourth quarter, when customers upgrade to or buy new phones. Smaller rival Sprint Corp offered 50 percent off to encourage users to switch to its network, and T-Mobile US Inc launched a free video streaming plan. Customer defections, or churn, in Verizon's postpaid business fell to 0.96 percent from 1.14 percent a year earlier. "The margin performance on wireless was better than anticipated really on the back of lower-than-expected postpaid churn," Evercore ISI analyst Jonathan Schildkraut said. Average revenue per account, however, fell 6.6 percent to $148.30, below the analysts' forecast of $149.61, according to FactSet. Jefferies analyst Mike McCormack said Verizon must curb such declines in this measure this year. Sales at the company's FiOS high-speed Internet, TV and phone service rose 6.8 percent to $3.53 billion. Net income attributable to Verizon was $5.39 billion, or $1.32 per share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $2.23 billion, or 54 cents per share. Excluding special items such as pension adjustments, Verizon earned 89 cents per share, above the analysts' average forecast of 88 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Operating revenue rose 3.2 percent to $34.25 billion. Analysts had expected $34.10 billion.
