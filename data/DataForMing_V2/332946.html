Report: Yahoo may cede board seats to Starboard Value - Yahoo! Inc.

The proposal, if made, could be seen as the board buckling after months of relentless attacks from Starboard, whose founder Jeff Smith is looking to oust CEO Marissa Mayer as he agitates for a sale of the company's core Internet business. Insiders, however, are skeptical whether Starboard will accept anything less than majority control of Yahoo’s board, which recently dwindled to seven seats.
