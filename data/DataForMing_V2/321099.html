Apple: The Myth Of Enormous iPhone Profitability - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha An SA contributor has asserted that iPhone gross margin is greater than 70% and the rest of Apple is unprofitable. This assertion confirms the bears' view of AAPL as too dependent on iPhone. Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPhone enjoys a reputation for very high gross margin. Exactly how high a margin is unknown since Apple only reports gross margin on a company-wide basis. Some have assumed that the iPhone margin is greater than 70%, but this is a myth that runs afoul both of common sense and Apple's financial history. The idea that iPhone garners enormous profits is an appealing one to Apple bears. A recent article by SA contributor Michael Blair asserted that AAPL makes about $500 on average per iPhone. According to the company's December-quarter earnings , Apple's iPhone ASP was $690.5, which would put the iPhone's gross margin at 72.4%. Such an assumption is appealing to bears for a number of reasons. For one, it makes Apple seem enormously greedy, to be gouging consumers to such an extent. And it makes the consumers who buy iPhone seem almost incomprehensibly stupid. Anyone who would buy such an overpriced product must be a pathetic Apple Fan. The assumed gross margin also reinforces the notion that Apple is too dependent on iPhone. Michael Blair goes beyond mere over dependence to assert in effect that Apple would lose money without iPhone. His $500 gross profit per phone translates into $37.39 billion in gross profit for the December quarter with 74.78 million iPhone unit sales. Apple only reported a company gross profit of $30.423 billion in the December quarter, so Blair assumes that the rest of the company must be suffering a gross loss. Does this make any sense at all? Through the wonders of the Apple Wayback Machine (otherwise known as SEC filings ), we can journey allllll the way back to 1 B.i. (Before iPhone, otherwise known as fiscal 2006). In those ancient times, which no one living can now remember (since we all live in the United States of Amnesia ), AAPL was forced to subsist on sales of crude calculating machines and toy music boxes. Poor Apple scratched out a meager existence on the leavings of the glorious Wintel Empire. As we examine Apple's 10-K for fiscal 2006, chiseled as it were on stone tablets, we, financial archaeologists, make an astounding discovery! In the year 1 B.i., ancient Apple was actually profitable! Not only that, but also Apple's gross margin was a quite healthy 28.9%. Nor was this any fluke. In the following fiscal year 2007, iPhone had been introduced, but its revenue was a mere 0.5% of Apple's revenue for the entire fiscal year. In that year, gross margin rose to 34%. What the bears seem to forget is that the factors that contribute to the profitability of iPhone apply as well to its other product lines. By 2004, Apple had offshored the last of its Mac manufacturing. Most of Apple's products were being made by contract manufacturers such as Foxconn ( OTC:FXCOF ) in China, so AAPL already enjoyed these benefits to its bottom line before the iPhone was introduced. All of Apple's products command a premium relative to competing products in their markets, so the combination of price premium and low cost manufacturing could hardly be expected to yield a negative gross margin. With the reasonable and historically justified assumption that non-iPhone revenue has about a 30% gross margin, we can easily back out the iPhone gross margin with a little algebra. For the December quarter, it works out to 44.8%, or about 5% more than the company average. More than anything else, this really bears on the issue of iPhone cost. For the December quarter, this says that each iPhone cost $381 to make on average, not the roughly $200 Blair assumed. For years now, analysts have been coming up with $200-250 estimated cost to build the iPhone. The BofA Merrill Lynch estimate that Blair cites is just the latest example. One can find a similar estimate from TechInsights . The iPhone cost estimates keep coming in around the same number despite having been repudiated by Apple CEO Tim Cook in the fiscal 2015 Q2 earnings conference call where he said: ... there's cost breakdowns that come out around our products that are much different than the reality. I've never seen one that is anywhere close to being accurate. I've pointed out before that the cost estimates from analysts such as TechInsights are too low. The basic problem with these estimates is that they price the iPhone as if it were composed of off-the-shelf commodity parts. Almost nothing important in the iPhone is a commodity part. Certainly not the processor, which is custom-designed by Apple, and most of the other major components are custom developed in conjunction with suppliers. This includes the distinctive retina display screen, cameras, battery, circuit card assembly, and aluminum housing. The cost estimates also appear to allow nothing for Apple's supply chain management and engineering support, which would normally be charged as cost of revenue (against gross margin). Finally, the cost estimates appear not to allow for profit, either for prime contractors such as Foxconn, or subcontractors such as Jabil Circuit (NYSE: JBL ). iPhone is clearly an important profit source for Apple, but the idea that it's the only one simply doesn't withstand reasonable scrutiny. This is important because it bears on Apple's long-term future. Apple is making efforts to diversify its products and services. If the company were truly unprofitable outside of iPhone, these efforts could be regarded as futile. But I think it's clear that non-iPhone Apple is quite a viable company. In fiscal 2015, Apple's non-iPhone revenue was $78.7 billion. That's still larger than all of Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) 2015 revenue of $75 billion. Besides developing new products and services for consumers, Apple has the ability to develop important new cloud services for developers, as I've pointed out previously . The company has many avenues available to increase its revenue and profit. The myth that Apple is dependent on iPhone for profitability conveys that it is paralyzed by its own success. This may be appealing to Apple bears, but it defies logic, common sense, and recent history. I remain long Apple and recommend it as a buy.
