We Can Do Better Than Buffett: 2 Dividend Stocks For 2016 - Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) | Seeking Alpha Warren Buffett is unlike the average dividend investor in that he does not purposefully seek out dividends. While many investors might pooh-pooh the act of following Buffettâ€™s investments, others likely see the benefit. Warren Buffett is unlike the average dividend investor in that he does not purposefully seek out dividends. Rather, Buffett looks for great companies that can consistently produce cash. If some of that cash happens to turn into dividends - great: He'll reinvest in other great companies. While many investors might pooh-pooh the act of following Buffett's investments, others likely see the benefit: Buffett spends most of his working life analyzing the intrinsic valuation of a company so as to increase the probability of buying a stock on the rise. As most investors are not full-time fundamental analysts, they would be wise to at least consider Buffett's picks - especially recent picks. Recent additions to the Buffett portfolio show not only that a stock is likely undervalued as per Buffett's valuation but also are likely to boost the stock simply by having Buffett as a backer. In this article, we look at two dividend-paying stocks that have recently been the target of Buffett. We then find a way to add these stocks to our portfolio to generate even more income. Let's begin: Buffett's recent addition of PSX comes after a dividend hike of 12.5%. The company has consistently increased its dividend by large degrees since 2012. Although the stock price has made the yield bumpy, it clearly is on the rise in the long-term: A stock increasing its dividends with such aggressiveness better have the income to sustain the raises. For PSX, this is no problem whatsoever: PSX seems to be on its way to becoming a strong dividend growth stock. Another important aspect to consider when analyzing "Buffett dividend stocks" is that Buffett prefers buybacks to dividends. But remember that buybacks are only effective if the stock is undervalued when the buyback occurs. Obviously, if Buffett is buying a stock with buybacks, he considers it undervalued, which therefore implies that he believes the buybacks are warranted. PSX is set to buy back over $2B worth of stock in the future. This will lead to an inflation of the stock price. That is, all things being equal - i.e., if PSX were to trend sideways without the buybacks - the stock should still rise, making it a strong investment both for the growth and for the dividend growth. The only problem is that the yield, a little over 3%, is not exactly large. Sure, it's decent, but we can do better. One thing of note is that PSX is showing a slow but steady decline in volatility: With the statistical volatility and historical volatility roughly the same, options are neither expensive nor cheap. However, that downward decline does tell us that selling options with high vega could bring us quicker-than-average income. For such a case, I recommend selling long-dated naked put options. This put is far enough out of the money to where we should feel safe, but it's close enough to where the income is decent. We will be adding over 7% to our yield if we roll this over after November. This gives our strategy of holding PSX a total yield of 10%: 3% from dividends and 7% from naked puts. Buffett is not a gambler. He invests in companies that will likely be around after he himself is gone. For the most part, he is a value investor. I've written two articles on Apple's recent emergence as a value stock, not a growth stock. Apple has lost its monopoly - and this is not a bad thing . Still, this upset many Apple fans, as a major base of the stockholders became involved when Apple was constantly producing innovative products. Buffett's recent acquisition of more shares further points to Apple being a value-based company, not an innovative company. In addition, the company has restarted its dividend growth, having raised the dividend twice in the past two years. With a strong consumer base and products that almost necessitate further purchases, Apple is a brand that should hold a significant market share in its industry - Arguably Apple is the Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO ) of personal computers, an analogy that certainly meshes with Buffett's portfolio. To take this analogy further - perhaps to the Apple growth stock holder's chagrin - is that Apple products are necessarily redundant. A can of Coke is drank and disposed of. An Apple computer is used and disposed of - but not because it is used up. No, unlike other computer and smart phone users, Apple's users tend to upgrade to the newest model, despite the current model being perfectly usable. This points to a constant stream of cash a la KO's business model, albeit much more expensive and complicated. It is no wonder Buffett likes Apple. While the stock has struggled over the past year, Buffett saw this as an opportunity to buy a strong value stock at a fair price. Arguably, Apple was trading as a growth stock when in fact the company is more like KO in nature. But Apple's dividend yield is only 60% of KO's. Apple investors looking for income should look to options strategies to supplement the low yield. Much like PSX, AAPL shows no arbitrage opportunity between the statistical and historical volatility: Yet both volatilities are falling. Perhaps this is a pattern (most likely unintentional on Buffet's part) of stocks Buffett adds to his portfolio. Regardless, such stocks point to naked puts being comparatively profitable at such times. This is much like the PSX naked put in risk, in length and in the greeks' profile. Vega is high, which implies the option has much of the declining volatility priced in. In other words, as volatility continues to fall, this option will lose much of its value, which allows us an opportunity to buy it back at a cheaper price in the future, even if AAPL begins to fall. Selling one of these puts for every lot of AAPL stock will give you an extra 4.5% yield annually, rolling the naked put over as it expires. This brings AAPL's income up to 7.5%, which is attractive by any measurement. With Buffett's favorite dividend stocks for 2016 showing volatility patterns characteristic of profitable naked put selling, we should consider adding this income strategy to our portfolio. After all, if we are to use Buffett even as a general example of a good investor, we are aiming at long-term profits. These two strategies give extra income on two stocks that already have solid forward outlooks for 2016. My Exploiting Earnings premium subscription is now live, here on Seeking Alpha.
