Apple Watch: Expect Much Better Sales In The September Quarter - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha According to IDC, Apple shipped 3.6 million Apple Watches in the June quarter. This put Apple second only to Fitbit in wearables unit shipments, while Apple was almost certainly first in revenue and profit. IDC's recent report on the wearables market placed Apple Watch at the number two position just behind Fitbit (NYSE: FIT ) in June quarter shipments. More importantly, IDC stated that the wearables market had grown 223% y/y. Once again, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is positioning itself to earn the most profit in an exploding new personal electronics market. IDC's report estimated shipments of Apple Watch in the June quarter to be 3.6 million, behind Fitbit's total of 4.4 million. This was much better than what I had estimated as of the June quarter Apple earnings report. Assuming an ASP of $450 and Watch revenue of $952 million, I had estimated about 2.1 million unit sales for the quarter. Even if you assume that the ASP was just the base price of the Watch Sport of $349, and you round up the revenue estimate to $1 billion, that only comes out to 2.86 million Watches sold. As far as I can tell, IDC is estimating shipments into distribution channels for which Apple hadn't yet received payment as of the end of June. Regardless of whether Apple got paid for all the Watches it shipped in the June quarter, Chuck Jones pointed out in a recent Forbes article that Apple shipped more Watches in its first quarter of availability (according to IDC), than it did iPads (3.3 million) or iPhones (1.1 million). Apple needed to create some channel inventory after the painfully slow start of Apple Watch sales in April. At this point, I see no reason to be concerned that the inventory is going to sit around gathering dust. Here, the statement regarding Apple Watch in the Q2 earnings conference call by Best Buy (NYSE: BBY ) CEO Hubert Joly is very encouraging: Now because demand for Apple Watch has been so strong in these stores and online, we are excited to share that beginning September 4 we will be carrying Apple Watch in more than 900 of our big-box stores. Apple Watch will be available in all 1,050 of our big-box stores and in approximately 30 of our Best Buy Mobile Stores by the end of September. Apple currently has 453 stores worldwide, so the addition of Best Buy triples the retail presence of Apple Watch. Ever since the Slice data came out purporting to show a steep drop off of sales in June, I've been arguing that this was an artifact of sales shifting to in-store as store inventory became available. Slice could only measure online sales in the U.S. The importance of in-store availability was probably the single biggest miscalculation Apple made in the Watch launch. If Watch had been just another cheap plastic fitness watch, then I could see most people being willing to order it on line. But Apple Watch was too expensive, and just too nice for prospective customers to want to make a purchase decision without trying on the Watch. Customers naturally want to make sure that the Watch they select looks good on the their wrists That means sorting through all the color, band, and size options for the Watch. The process of making appointments just to try on the Watch, while having to order on line, was too cumbersome from the start, which is why Apple quickly pivoted away from it. But the lack of availability of many models and band options, combined with the cumbersome ordering process, doomed Apple Watch to a slow start. Having retail stock in all Best Buy big box stores by the end of September will certainly facilitate greater sales. Even now, selection in Best Buy's online store is very limited. Watch Sport is fully stocked with size, color and band options, but Watch is limited to the sport bands or Milanese loop. No leather bands, no stainless bracelet, and no space black color option. A quick check of in-store availability showed that only about half the stores in L.A. had stock on hand. The limited selection and lack of stock shows that Watch is still somewhat supply constrained. Didn't Tim Cook say during the June earnings call that supply/demand balance had been reached for Watch? Yes, he did, for the demand generated by Apple's retail and online stores. With Best Buy in the picture, that demand goes up a notch. By choosing premium materials and by endowing the Watch with capabilities that no other smart watch can match, Apple has positioned Watch at the top tier of the market. We can now expect Apple to begin pressuring the profit margins of its competitors, such as Fitbit. For the June quarter, Fitbit posted a healthy operating profit of $80.4 million on revenue of $400.4 million for a respectable operating margin of 20%. At the previously estimated Watch revenue of $952 million, Apple's profit would have been approximately $266 million, assuming their corporate operating margin of 28% for the June quarter. So Apple is already clobbering its most important competitor in terms of revenue and profit. And it's only going to get worse for Fitbit. Fitbit's plastic sports bands will get forced down market as it seeks to maintain unit sales. Apple's superior margins immediately give it the ability to out-invest Fitbit in wearable technology. The next major innovation for Apple Watch is right around the corner. This is the arrival of Watch OS 2 which will allow developers to create native Watch apps. The impact will be to give Watch an even greater ecosystem advantage. The next major advance for Apple Watch will be the application of 14 nm FinFET process technology to the Watch. This is already expected to improve the performance and battery life of the next iPhone. The new fabrication process is, if anything, even more important for Apple Watch. Frankly, Watch still feels a little under powered for the burden of functionality it carries, and battery life is ... well ... acceptable. The FinFET process will improve both performance and battery life, and will probably become an Apple Watch exclusive when Apple upgrades the Watch processor some time next year. Just on the basis of Best Buy retail participation and greater general availability, I expect Apple Watch to easily exceed June quarter sales at about 5 million units. At the assumed ASP of $450, this yields about $2.25 billion in revenue. At an operating margin of about 30%, this yields an operating profit of $675 million, which is easily more than Fitbit's expected revenue for the quarter. As Apple continues to invest in its wearable tech, its dominance of the premium tier of the wearables market will only increase. Before long, we may see Apple taking most of the industry profit in smart watches as it now does in smart phones. Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL.
