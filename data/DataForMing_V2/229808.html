Why Do You Own Disney? - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Disney and Star Wars are now synonymous and the franchise remains a massive growth catalyst for many more quarters. Merchandise can be consistently strong if marketing efforts pan out. Disney (NYSE: DIS ) has done a 180 since August. After scaring shareholders by dipping to incredibly low levels, the stock has rallied to just a few percentage points off its all-time highs. While the focus remains on ESPN subscriber growth amid cord-cutting concerns, the company has a lot to offer on other fronts, notably studio productions and a merchandise expansion, leading me to believe this company is a buy from a growth perspective. If you effectively did not check your holdings for the last three months, you missed a lot. After dipping into the low-$90s in late August, in a trend correlating with the broader market, the stock bounced and went on an uptrend to its current level of $115.67. It has surpassed its 50 and 200 DMAs of $106.18 and $107.62, respectively. While the stock has been overbought in the last few sessions, the RSI sits just under 70. Below you can see the summer and current trend: If you haven't circled the Star Wars release date (December 18) on your calendar or pre-ordered tickets, you're out of the mix. More broadly, Disney has an excellent lineup of growth catalysts for the quarter and while expectations may be increasing given the hype seen around certain segments, I believe this company will continue to raise the bar. My trading strategy with Disney has not changed, even given the recent dip in price. It revolves around understanding the growth catalysts in each individual revenue stream. The next installment is already bigger than itself. It is expanding into a Disney XD series called Star Wars Rebels and in partnership with Electronic Arts (NASDAQ: EA ), is about to release Star Wars: Battlefront, a highly anticipated video game that is the first related title released in eleven years that is projected to sell 13 million copies by the end of Q1 2016. This was raised from previous guidance of 9 million copies. The company is even creating Star Wars-themed additions in Disneyland and Disney World. When you think about the long-term effect of Star Wars, one word should come to mind: consistency. With three movies coming out by the end of 2017, there are multiple billion dollar top-line boosts on the way. The only true downside that comes with Star Wars is high expectations, not just in terms of reviews, but in box office tickets. Estimates are ranging from $2 billion to $2.2 billion in gross sales, which is an incredibly high bar to reach. However, if preorders are an indication of what's to come, then that expectation will be met. We saw the consumer products segment notably increase 11% last quarter, with the base growth still being driven by strong Frozen sales, as well as Avengers merchandise. These numbers will likely see a pickup this quarter as well, considering the imminent release of Star Wars. While we should expect the revenues from Frozen and Avengers to slide based upon the decreasing relevancy, Disney isn't about to let this segment suffer. Think about the success of movies this summer, too. Ant-Man has grossed nearly $515 million at the box office and Inside Out is another Pixar hit grossing $845 million. Bumping up marketing expenses to gain a larger recongition in the holiday retail push could really help the company see new highs. Looking to 2016, Disney has some significant film-related merch opportunities. The Jungle Book is due out in April, followed up by Captain America: Civil War in May, and Finding Dory in June. Queuing up hype around these films will be key to continued double-digit growth for this segment. The Shanghai Disney Resort has been a development a long time coming. The Parks and Resorts segment was up 10% this past quarter and this is going to help keep the double-digit growth sustainable. This resort will open in Spring of 2016 and is gaining popularity by the second in Shanghai. While trademark infrigement will continue to be a headline revolving around this $5.5 billion park, a Chinese agency is helping to preseve Disney's integrity. After the park opens, I'd expect significant weight to be on the average amount spent per person. We get it. Watching baseball all summer can be quite miserable and when streaming is gaining as much popularity as it is, concerns about cable networks seeing diminished growth are real, material movers. The fall lineup is now in fall swing with hockey and football dominating air time and cable once again has relevance. Q3 showed us that Media Networks increased 12% to $5.8 billion in segment revenue, and furthermore, operating income in this segment was up 27%. Yes, ESPN has laid off 300 employees, which is certainly not a growth indication, but live sports continue to be a major contribution to the company's long-term health. The fears of cord-cutting are overblown, as many authors before me have stated. Disney has strong cash flow, showed double digit growth in a majority of segments for Q3, and has good growth prospects both short and long-term. That signals a buy to me.
