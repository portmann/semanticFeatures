Amazon Reportedly In Talks To Purchase Luxury Online Retailer Net-A-Porter â€“ Consumerist Amazon appears to be on the cusp of its largest purchase ever with the potential purchase of luxury online retailer Net-a-Porter. Citing a person close to the matter, Forbes reports that negotiations for the potential $2.16 billion acquisition are still in the early stages. Amazon has a long history of high-dollar purchases. Last year, the company shelled out $1.1 billion for video game streaming company Twitch . Before that, in 2009, the e-retailer purchases online shoe retailer Zappos for $1.2 billion. Forbes reports that Amazon’s previous pushes into the high-end retail world have largely fell flat, because consumer generally associate the online retailer with discounts and non-luxury brands. Back in 2006, the company acquired Shopbop and retooled the site to focus on more designer brands. Then, in 2012, Amazon executives made a push for what they deemed a significant investment in luxury brands.
