Apple With A 10% Yield - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. Apple has a short but solid dividend history. However, many income investors see the low comparative dividend yield and simply move on to other possibilities. Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) recent dividend history has thus far been short but sweet. The company began paying a $2.65 quarterly dividend in 2012 (closer to $0.38 on a split-adjusted basis), which at the time took up a fourth or so of the company's profits. Since then, the company has increased its dividend by 15% in 2013, 8% in 2014, and nearly 11% during 2015. This represents a dividend growth rate of about 11% per annum, roughly in line with (actually trailing) the earnings-per-share growth, resulting in a payout ratio today of closer to 20% or so. This has prompted many to call for even faster dividend growth as the ability is certainly there. Yet, the company has remained prudent in utilizing both dividends and share repurchases, thus keeping its flexibility intact. Moreover it should be noted that even "moderate" growth could still be quite solid in the coming years. Today, the company pays a $0.52 quarterly dividend or $2.08 on an annual basis. In reality, you would anticipate receiving more than this in the coming year (another increase is likely), but this is the number you'd see quoted on most financial websites. With a share price under $105, this has led to headlines of Apple with a 2% dividend yield. For most companies, this would be uninspiring. For a massive corporation in excellent financial condition only paying out a small portion of profits, it becomes a bit more interesting. Still, for income-focused investors, a 2% yield isn't especially compelling, even if superior growth is expected. As a point of reference, it would take Apple 15 years of growing its payout by 10% annually to match the yearly income from AT&T (NYSE: T ) growing its dividend at 2%, and that's prior to thinking about reinvesting the larger payout to start in addition to the higher aggregate payouts along the way. Naturally, the capital appreciation of Apple could be greater (and indeed income may not be a consideration for a good deal of investors). Yet, the idea is that even with the now higher current yield and solid expected growth, the security isn't the most compelling from an income standpoint. With this information in hand, the income investor could do one of three things: 1) pass on the security, perhaps waiting for a higher yield in the future, 2) invest in the security, accepting a lower comparative yield but faster growth prospects or 3) look for a way to both own the security and generate a greater cash flow. Let's explore the last option (quite literally). At the time of this writing, shares of AAPL are trading a bit above $104. If you were to buy today, a $10,500 investment could purchase 100 whole shares of the company. Based on the current $2.08 annual dividend, this would equate to receiving $208 in annual income plus whatever happens to the underlying security. If partnering with the company, I'd contend that it's prudent to have a long-term mindset such that you're happy to own the company for years. In this way, at the end of the year, you'd be fine with selling at a higher price, but not obligated to do so if shares happened to be lower. Now, let's look at a way to increase your cash flow. As I write, the bid for the January 20, 2017, call option with a $105 strike price is $11.05 or thereabouts. This means that someone is willing to pay you $1,105 (less commissions) for you to sell your 100 shares of Apple at a price of $105 during the next year. This would be a "covered call" where you own the underlying security and agree to sell at someone else's discretion. Now, let's look at the possible outcomes from this agreement. In its simplest form, there are only two: either the option is exercised or it is not. If the option were to go unexercised - as would likely be the case if the share price remained under $105 - you would collect your dividend payments and still have your option premium, call it $1,080 after transaction costs. In this instance, you would receive ~$1,288 or a yield of about 12.3% based on your initial investment. Your return would be different, but this is your expected cash flow, with the vast majority coming upfront. A second possibility is that the option is exercised. Say shares go up to $130. You still have to sell at $105 - thus missing out on the larger gain - but you get to keep the option premium and any dividends received along the way. To make it easy, we'll assume that you received no dividends (although it's certainly plausible that you would get a few payments). In this case, your immediate cash flow would be $1,080 (a 10% yield as indicated in the title) to go along with a small capital gain. The downside relates to "missing out." In the second scenario, you could have simply held the shares for a 25%+ gain. By selling a covered call, you capped your gain at 11% or so. For many, this is a true cost to consider; for others, the cash flow component is the most important part. It's not often talked about, but you can generate a 10% annual yield from owning companies like Apple. The "risk" is not capturing all of the gains. The benefit is that you get substantial cash from a security that you'd be happy to hold, which, by the way, is an important sub-point: this is only useful for companies that you'd be happy to hold. If you wouldn't be happy to hold shares of Apple if the price dropped 25%, a 10% premium doesn't do you much good. Yet, if you have a long-term mindset, this sort of agreement can provide a true boost to your yield. It's certainly well beyond anything the same amount of cash value could earn. Of course, you don't have to agree to sell your shares near today's price. There are many alternatives. Here's a look at various strike prices and potential premiums for the January 20, 2017, call date: Here I've assumed transaction costs of $0.25 to come to a "net" premium, which could naturally be much higher than what you would pay. The idea is to allow for fluctuations and demonstrate some costs involved. It's not exactly what you'd pay or receive, but it gives you an idea as to what could be available. Note that this table only represents one possibility - the option being exercised - and thus paints a rosier picture than what could actually happen. As an example, if the share price were to decline by 25%, the $145 strike would not be exercised, and thus, your total return for the year would be closer to negative 24% (plus dividends received). Selling a covered call is not a sure way to have a positive gain. The above table simply shows you the arrangement to which you are agreeing should your shares be called away. As a further illustration, let's say you own 100 shares of Apple and are happy to hold for your years. You could do simply that, collecting your dividends along the way. Your shares would be worth 100 times whatever the share price happens to be. Alternatively, perhaps you sold the $120 call option. In this case, you would be agreeing to sell your 100 shares at a price of $120 in the next year. The downside is that you likely don't get to hold your shares if the price goes above this mark. The upside is that you're paid upfront for this "risk." If the option goes unexercised, it's the same as holding your 100 shares; you still collect your dividend payments and your shares are still worth 100 times whatever the share price happens to be. The difference is that you also received $530 upfront, perhaps 2.5 times the annual dividend paid, to do with as you please. If the option is exercised, you don't get the extra upside, but you keep the $530 in premiums to go along with a 15% capital gain. In total, you would be agreeing to a gain of 20% should your shares be called away. And that's prior to thinking about any dividends received before the shares are called away. You begin to "miss out" if the share price were to increase above $125, but I'd contend that it's hard to suggest that a 20% annual gain is especially troublesome. In short, a lot of income investors see AAPL's comparatively low yield and move on to the next possibility. Yet, I would contend that this mindset could be missing out on significant opportunities regarding one's investing goals. The first step should be to consider whether or not the company is sound, has a reasonable future and is being offered at a price that gives you a "fair shake" with regard to capturing business performance. If these don't hold, that's the time to move on to the next alternative. Yet, if these do hold, a low dividend yield may not be the "deal breaker" that it appears to be. As illustrated above, by agreeing to sell your shares, you can significantly increase your immediate cash flow. If you agreed to sell just above today's price, you could have an immediate 10% yield. The downside is missed gains, but the upside is a substantial upfront cash flow. Moving to higher strike price agreements, the immediate income goes down, but the downside of missed returns becomes less and less. It's possible to double or triple your expected income by agreeing to 20% or 30% annual gains. This isn't covered as often in the income world, but it's certainly a tangible possibility for those looking for higher cash flows derived from quality businesses.
