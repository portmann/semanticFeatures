AT&T: Still Facing Pressure - AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) | Seeking Alpha AT&T reported Q1'15 earnings that exceeded analyst EPS estimates. The reported numbers were a decline from the previous year due to lower margins from declining phone ARPU. When reviewing the quarterly numbers for AT&T (NYSE: T ), one needs to keep in mind that the quarterly beat was still a reduction from prior-year levels. The wireless provider produced contrasting numbers to the earnings growth delivered by Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ ). Similar to Verizon, AT&T is no longer an expensive stock if it can return to growth. The Q1 numbers aren't nearly as convincing considering the continued margin pressure that led to adjusted earnings declining 10% over the prior year. All while the company ironically reported the best ever churn rate in the quarter at 1.02%. The numbers suggested either AT&T is willing to engage more in the domestic pricing war or the wireless provider is required to lower prices in order to keep customers. For Q1, AT&T reported an adjusted operating margin that was actually lower than the levels of 2013. This trend is the absolute opposite of Verizon that was able to report a rebound in margins to the 2014 levels, if not higher. As the Cowen report suggested, the domestic wireless providers continue to face pressure for ARPA (average revenue per account). In the case of AT&T, the company is seeing ARPU (average revenue per user) gain. These numbers though include monthly billing for equipment. In reality, the key phone-only ARPU continues to drop with the company reporting a 1.7% sequential decline and a 9.6% decline from last year. Typical of the wireless provider market, it is difficult to compare apples to apples with these numbers. The key is in the details of the services offered in order to obtain these rates. The major concern with the 5.75% dividend yield of AT&T is that the company only produced free cash flow of $2.8 billion. Not only was the amount substantially below the $4.2 billion level of Verizon, but also it was right above the $2.4 billion paid for dividends. The company has limited cash left to pay down the massive debt of over $96 billion, leading to the interest expense that grew 4.5% YoY to $899 million. As well, the company needs to layer on more debt for the DirecTV (NASDAQ: DTV ) deal that requires a cash payment of $28.50 per share. AT&T recently sold $17.5 billion in bonds to finance the deal. One major takeaway is the projected increase of the cost synergies from the DirecTV deal of at least $2.5 billion, up $900 million from original forecasts. The increase in these forecasted savings from this deal helps overcome the concerns that AT&T will continue facing margin pressures in the domestic wireless segment. After the quarterly reports, my preference in the sector remains Verizon that has already turned around margins and isn't also facing a transformative merger like AT&T.
