Expect A Flood Of Upgrades For Best Buy - Best Buy Co. (NYSE:BBY) | Seeking Alpha Best Buy posted game-changing earnings results, with strong same-store sales growth and online sales growth. The company is getting closer with Apple, which is likely to provide excellent financial benefits. BBY is executing well with an eye toward the long term while still managing to reward shareholders. Best Buy is still way too cheap, and no analysts have upgraded the stock since it posted earnings. This represents a near-term catalyst. Best Buy (NYSE: BBY ) reported earnings that destroyed expectations, and its stock soared, just as I had predicted in my earlier article . However, even with a 13% bounce, the stock price is still way too low, especially given how much of a shift this latest earnings report represents. The most critical factor in the earnings report was the fact that comparable same-store sales were up by 3.8%, and that online sales were 17% up. Regarding the former, Best Buy had been reporting flat or marginally up same-store sales. That's why it's so surprising and impressive that it managed to deliver such significant same-store sales growth. It's also a slap in the face to the idea that the company is just a dying retailer cash cow, with both Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) eating their lunch, especially in light of the fact that online sales are up by double digits - this represents superb execution on its omnichannel strategy and shows that Best Buy isn't going to be going away like its bankrupt former competitors like RadioShack and Circuit City. Such significant growth and solid execution deserves a much greater premium than the 12 P/E it has currently been awarded with (EPS was 11% higher than it was a year ago). Moreover, Best Buy is setting itself up well for the future. In the conference call, it talked a great deal about its growing closeness with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) - the most valuable company in the world, stating that it was "working with Apple to update the 740 stores-within-a-store that were first implemented in 2007". This is a good sign, and with clear financial benefits, and this fact was also clear from the conference call. CEO Joly talked about how Apple Watch (a product that no other electronic retailers but Best Buy and Apple are selling) demand was very strong, and how it has helped it appeal to the early adopter market. Demand is so strong, that it plans to bring the Apple Watch to all 1,000 of its stores vs. the ~100 stores it is currently in. By being the first retailer to sell the Apple Watch, a move that was largely ignored by analysts, Best Buy has set itself up to greatly benefit from the growing demand for wearables, as many consumers now associate their brand with wearables. It's especially beneficial to have used the Apple Watch to do so, given it is higher margin than the other wearable devices on the market, allowing Best Buy to make more money. The company is also aggressively cutting costs, with Joly mentioning that BBY has cut $100 million in annual expenses already, which has "a goal of 400 million over three years." However, the most significant part of this is that it is being exceptionally intelligent about what it does with these cost savings - the company is investing heavily in growth initiatives, such as its website and improving its store-within-a-store concepts. Most companies only get aggressive about cutting costs when they're losing money and/or near bankruptcy. Best Buy is still immensely profitable, but has realized it needs to plan for the future, and the results of doing so can already be seen, such as from the 17% growth in online sales. By cutting costs while still being profitable, BBY can invest in the growth initiatives that will help it survive in the future without risking bankruptcy in the present. Moreover, the benefits of cutting costs will be felt long after the company has stopped investing so aggressively - after that, all of these cost savings will flow to its bottom line. This means that its current 11% EPS growth rate is actually reduced from what it would usually be. Best Buy is also very kind to its shareholders, having repurchased nearly $400 million worth of shares in the previous quarter, and yielding 3.5%. The analyst community hasn't issued any upgrades for Best Buy since its stellar results. The last three ratings are still downgrades , which makes the coming analyst upgrades a potential catalyst in the near term. Funnily enough, the downgrades were partly based on worries about comps, which is something I addressed in my earlier article. I am confident that upgrades will be coming because of the magnitude by which Best Buy beat expectations (especially on same-store sales), the Apple Watch demand that BBY is capitalizing upon and that its strategic initiatives such as its omnichannel strategy and Renew Blue are both working. Moreover, there is plenty of room for upgrades, given that 8 analysts have it rated as neutral while another 4 have it rated as sell.
