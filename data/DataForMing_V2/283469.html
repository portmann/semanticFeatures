Apple: We Know That We Don't Know Anything - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. Without context, this information is meaningless. On Tuesday, Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) shares declined once again after a Nikkei report was published stating that the company was going to significantly cut production of its newest iPhones in the current quarter. While the headline of a 30% cut in output will certainly scare investors, one must examine this news in further detail before truly running for the exits. For those that did not read the above article, here are the two main paragraphs that need to be analyzed: The U.S. company had initially told parts makers to keep production of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus for the quarter at the same level as with their predecessors - the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus - a year earlier. But inventories of the two models launched last September have piled up at retailers in markets ranging from China and Japan to Europe and the U.S. amid lackluster sales. Customers saw little improvement in performance over the previous generation, while dollar appreciation led to sharp price hikes in emerging markets. Output will be scaled back to let dealers go through their current stock. Production is expected to return to normal in the April-June quarter, once inventory adjustment is complete. Apple's products and brand have not lost their appeal, and older models have continued to sell. The last sentence is perhaps the key one - that is Apple's products and brand have not lost their appeal and older models continue to sell. While the Nikkei article talks about production cuts for the newest iPhones, it doesn't mention any plans for older generation phones. What if Apple at the same time has increased production plans for the 6 and 6 Plus? Another item to consider here is the introduction of a 4-inch phone coming in the next couple of months. Perhaps Apple's original production plans for the 6s/6s Plus were at a time when management had not finalized its decision to launch the smaller screen phone. If the company then decided to push forward with the 4-inch phone, the demand for that product would likely account for a sizable part of the production cut mentioned by Nikkei. The other item to consider is one that Nikkei did point out, and one I've covered in the past : pricing in relation to currency movements. In a number of markets, Apple started the 6s/6s Plus at much higher prices than it did for the previous generation of phones. With the dollar strengthening, this was a way to combat currency issues that have taken billions off the top line. However, the dollar's rise in comparison to a year ago has come down quite a bit, as you will see in the chart below. Even if Apple sells fewer units, it can make up some of the "loss" if the models it is selling come at much higher prices. *Future values based on current DCI value of 99.42. So while investors are worried again about Apple, thanks to the Nikkei report, we must remember that things have to be kept in context. There was nothing in the report about production of other models, which is quite significant, along with the possibility of the 4-inch phone. Additionally, while Apple may be selling less units, a number of emerging markets saw higher prices to combat currencies, which could soften the blow. Thanks to a drop in analyst estimates , which I'm sure will continue after Tuesday's report, the street is currently expecting a 23.63% sequential decline in revenues from fiscal Q1 (December 2015 ending quarter) to fiscal Q2 (March 2016 ending). That's larger than last year's decline of 22.24%. Apple could have new revenue sources in this quarter from Apple Pay in China, the potential launch of the 4-inch phone, and the expected iPad Air upgrade. Also, if the new Apple Watch launches, there may not be as much of a sales falloff from that category sequentially. At some point, you have to figure that analyst estimates would be low enough that the company couldn't miss. In the past, Apple CEO Tim Cook has brushed off these "supply chain" notes, stating that many of them have not turned out correct. The Nikkei report seems to be the latest in that line, as it ignores a bunch of key items that would provide context. Apple will report its Q1 results on January 26th, and at that point, we'll find out what the truth is. Until then, there is only one thing that we do know, and that is that we don't know anything.
