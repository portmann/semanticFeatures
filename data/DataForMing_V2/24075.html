Apple Watch Success Not Limited To Unit Sales - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Watch will boost company's retail store traffic, showcasing entire Apple ecosystem. Retail stores accounted for nearly $21.5 billion in fiscal 2014 revenues. We are just one day away from consumers being able to pre-order the highly anticipated Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Watch, with the device becoming available two weeks later. Initial sales estimates of this new product vary substantially, mostly depending on which side of the Apple fence you are on. When looking at the success of a particular Apple product, many investors and analysts look at unit sales. That is certainly one important metric to follow, although average selling prices need to be analyzed as well. Apple is not planning on reporting the Watch in its own category early on. If Apple does not release a unit sales number for the Watch, there will be many trying to dig into the company's financials trying to extrapolate some information. You would think that if pre-orders are tremendous in the first day or two or the opening weekend is a blockbuster, Apple would come out with a press release detailing its success. One key I would like to hear from the company is how many customers are also purchasing other products (add-ons). The Apple Watch is sure to boost traffic to Apple's retail stores, and that means millions of extra customers over time. How many times does someone go to the store to buy a specific item, but if they see something else they like, they purchase that too? According to Apple's most recent 10-Q filing , the company had almost 450 stores as of December 27th, 2014. About 60% of those stores were located in the United States, which is important because the US is one of only a few selective countries to get the Watch this month . You can see the overall growth in Apple's retail store count in the chart below. I doubt analysts will ask about this, but I'd like to know how many customers that purchase a Watch in store end up buying another product. Apple's retail stores have generated about 1/8th of the company's sales in recent years, so they are certainly a key part of the business. Even if a consumer decides not to buy the Watch on their specific visit, they still might choose to purchase another Apple product, which might actually have a higher selling price. If someone walks into an Apple store looking to buy a $400 Watch and ends up buying a $700 iPhone instead, the company will probably be quite happy. The Watch should definitely help drive retail traffic, which will help showcase the entire product map and Apple ecosystem. Also, for those that want a Watch but don't have a compatible iPhone, the company could be looking at two sales in one. When it comes to Watch sales estimates, we've heard almost everything. Some believe that it is a niche product that might only sell a couple of million units in the first year, while others believe Apple's brand loyalty could help the company sell 50 million units in a year. Most reports have stated that Apple has ordered about 5-6 million units initially, so perhaps that could be the target number for the first couple of sales months. We might get an indication of how sales are doing based on Apple's guidance for the June-ending fiscal Q3 period. Remember, sales of the device will not impact the March-ending fiscal Q2 results we'll get in a couple of weeks. In the past two years, the sequential revenue decline from fiscal Q2 to Q3 has been 18.99% and 18.00%, respectively. Thanks to sales of the Watch, that decline is expected to narrow a bit, with the current average analyst estimate being for a 15.8% decline. If you were to take the average of the past two years (18.5%) and apply it to the current Q2 estimate, the current fiscal Q3 average implies about a $1.5 billion revenue bump. If the Watch's average selling price comes in around $600, that would imply about 2.5 million units in the first fiscal quarter. It is important to note however, that we have seen analyst estimates rise in recent weeks, for two reasons. First, Watch pricing seemed to be a little higher than most were expecting. The second item is Apple's recently reported price raises , which will help the company battle the sharp rise in the US dollar. The table below shows a history of fiscal Q3 analyst estimate averages over the past couple of months. Apple selected a decent time for the Watch to come to market. First, we are in the company's fiscal third quarter, where Apple's sales decline sequentially until we approach the next iPhone launch and holiday period. Even if the Watch only delivers a few billion in quarterly revenues, those dollars are more important during lower sales periods. The second major item is that competitor Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) is launching its new Galaxy S6 smartphone. The launch of the Apple Watch will take away some of the news flow from the S6 launch. Additionally, since the Watch relies on a connection to one of the newer model iPhones, there could be a sales bump for the iPhone when sales are naturally declining. Finally, the Watch becomes officially available on April 24th. That opening sales weekend is right before the company will report fiscal Q2 earnings on Monday, April 27th. Even though Apple is not breaking out Watch sales quite yet, as the product will represent a small portion of overall revenues, you can expect a heavy dose of Watch related questions on the conference call. In the end, many will be looking to see how many Watches are sold by Apple. However, we may not get an actual number from the company, especially in the first couple of reporting periods. I'm also curious to see what the impact is on other Apple products. Are consumers bundling when they show up at a retail store to purchase the Watch? Also, does the Watch's launch help provide a small boost to iPhone sales, since you need a newer model phone to use the Watch? One thing is sure, and that is that the Apple Watch will provide a boost to Apple's retail traffic, especially in the United States. That should help the company's top line number regardless of how many Watches are sold, and strong quarterly revenue figures could help this stock hit a new all-time high.
