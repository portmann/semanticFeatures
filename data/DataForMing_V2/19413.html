Google Taunts Microsoft With $149 Chromebooks - Google Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) | Seeking Alpha Google has recruited Chinese OEMs to create $149 Chromebooks. The company has also recruited ASUSTeK to create a sub-$100 Chrome OS dongle stick. This should help Google increase Chromebooks' market share in the U.S. education system. I thought Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) would be able to slow down the momentum of Chromebooks. Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) decided to intensify its campaign to defeat Windows computers in the U.S. education sector. The new $149 Chromebooks from Chinese OEMs Haier and Hisense would compete with the alleged upcoming Microsoft's $149 Windows 10 notebooks . Google gets the early-bird advantage, since the Haier Chromebook 11 would be available by April 17, while Microsoft will only release Windows 10 by summer. Chromebooks may not be able to play the most popular PC games like DoTA 2 or League of Legends, but they are very popular in the U.S. According to Gartner, the U.S. education sector helped buy 5 million Chromebooks in 2014. According to Future Source Consulting, Chromebooks were the best-selling PCs for two consecutive quarters last year in the U.S. K-12 education market. As per the chart from Future Source Consulting, Chromebooks accounted for 37% share in PCs sold to the U.S. K-12 education sector in Q3 2014. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Windows notebooks' share are declining. Tablets are also declining. Only Chromebooks have consistently increase their share in the education market for the last four quarters. The introduction of $149 Chromebooks could accelerate the continuing decline of Windows PCs in the U.S. education system. Budget-constrained school districts would probably succumb to the allure of $149 Chromebooks. Furthermore, the $149 Haier and Hisense Chromebooks are also ideal for emerging markets. Schools in emerging countries have far less annual budgets than their U.S. counterparts. However, the chart below from Future Source Consulting reveals that Chromebooks already had 16% share of PCs shipped out to the global K-12 education market. Lowering the price tags of Chromebooks makes them very attractive to price-sensitive school administrators in emerging countries. The company is also offering a free suite of apps to help teachers and students learn and work faster. The education sector is a very important market for all PC vendors, and success in the education market means the enterprise sector is just around the corner. Once enterprise IT managers realize that Chromebooks could also work well in the corporate environment, Chrome OS notebooks and desktop computers could dethrone office-centric Windows PCs. The " Chrome For Work " initiative is Google targeting next Microsoft's lucrative enterprise business . Google has recruited VMware (NYSE: VMW ) and Citrix (NASDAQ: CTXS ) to let enterprise users run their Windows-only apps on Chromebooks through virtualization. Another major win for Google is that ASUSTeK ( OTC:ASUUY ) will soon release a Chrome OS computer dongle stick that will sell for less than $100. The Asus Chromebit will connect to any TV or monitor via HDMI. This is the same concept first unveiled by Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) during CES 2015. However, the Asus Chrome OS computer stick will be much cheaper, since the Intel Windows 8.1 Compute Stick will retail for $149. Price-sensitive customers will likely prefer the Asus Chromebit over the Intel Compute Stick. IT managers looking to save money will also appreciate the low per-unit cost of the Chromebit in replacing older Windows 7 or Windows XP desktop machines. Google's search, advertising, and cloud services benefit from more users using Chrome OS computers. Even K-12 students are fair game for online display ads or links. Surging sales of Chromebooks helps Google hurt Microsoft and Apple's sales to the K-12 education market. Success in the education market could lead to Chromebooks also invading the enterprise market. Deploying and maintaining cheap Chrome OS desktops in schools is a test bed for Google's ambition to replace Windows PCs inside corporate offices. The consumer is the ultimate winner in Google's quest to cure the world's addiction to Windows computers. Chromebooks could chip away at Windows' dominance. The world deserves another alternative to the Windows desktop OS. Linux on desktop has been a dead horse since 2012. Aside from Apple's Mac OS X, Chrome OS is the only other viable computer operating system that has the backing of Google, Intel, and major PC manufacturers. GOOG is a Buy . Its long-term potential is very attractive. The recent eMarketer report says Google will continue to dominate the $81.59 billion global search-based advertisements this year. The search ads business will grow to a $130.58 billion by 2019, and I not see any serious competition to Google. The company, as per eMarketer's estimate, will earn $44.46 billion on net search ad revenue in 2015. This represents a 54.5% global market share. Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU ) is second with 8%, and Microsoft is third with 4.2% share. Baidu's success is largely due to Google's absence in China. Google, apparently, is not too evil to quit its boycott of China. Even though there's billion of advertising money in China's huge online population, Google remains faithful to its 2010 decision to leave mainland China. My Buy rating for Google is also supported by the predictive algorithm of I Know First Research. The 3-month and 12-month scores of GOOG are both positive, which means the stock is currently undervalued and offers the opportunity of future rewards.
