The MnM Portfolio, September 2015: Ep. 7 - The Portfolio Transformation Continues | Seeking Alpha This monthâ€™s article marks the seventh installment in my ongoing series, which outlines my efforts to achieve dividend growth success. I review my portfolio and discuss my actions for the month of September. The title of this month's article focuses on what I hope will be one of the last sales within the portfolio for some time. As I recently wrote about ( HERE ), I sold my position in Molson Coors (NYSE: TAP ), as the stock surged on potential M&A activity in the alcoholic beverages industry. I chose to capitalize on the rapid appreciation in the stock and used the proceeds of the sale to increase my positions in Fastenal (NASDAQ: FAST ) and Cincinnati Financial (NASDAQ: CINF ). Additionally, I used the remaining portion of the proceeds to initiate a new position in Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ ). I was not against holding Molson, but I chose to capitalize on the opportunity to exit with a gain and move the funds into other securities that I feel are more promising. The portfolio remains at 24 positions, though I continue to consider only 23 of them to be core holdings. I am still holding LinnCo, LLC (NASDAQ: LNCO ) for a recovery in oil prices, and a better price point from which to divest. I am still looking to increase the portfolio size to 33-35 positions over time. I feel that at that level, I can effectively follow them all, and equally weighted they would provide strong diversification, as each would represent approximately 3% of the portfolio total. I have captured the activity for September and for the year-to-date in the standard rollforward summary below. The portfolio collected $291.12 in dividends and interest and saw continued unrealized losses during the month as the overall market fell. I am sure most of you are aware of the turbulence we have experienced. *note that Linn Co, LLC is a common stock, which holds units of Linn Energy, LLC (NASDAQ: LINE ), a master limited partnership. I consider it to be a proxy for a master limited partnership that I am able to hold in my IRA. Note that holding LINE in the portfolio would trigger tax consequences via a schedule K-1. As previously mentioned, I sold my position in Molson Coors during September. I would refer you to my recent article, linked above, for a summary of my actions surrounding the sale. The bulk of the additions this month were from the reallocation of the proceeds of the Molson Coors sale, amongst Fastenal, Verizon and Cincinnati Financial. I intend to continue to build my position in these securities over time, bringing them up closer and closer to the $3k mark. You can find more details about my Verizon purchase in the article referenced above, but in summary, I find it compelling as it's trading at a P/E multiple under 12, pays an increasing dividend of more than 5%, and should benefit from increasing data usage in the coming years. I also remain bullish on REITs, even though they have underperformed the broader market this year. I added a few shares of some of my beaten down small cap REITs. As an investor who is always looking for value, it's hard to argue against the pricing multiples on these investments. On a P/FFO multiple, I am most interested in building my stake in Chatham Lodging (NYSE: CLDT ) going forward. As mentioned already, I collected $291.12 in dividends and interest during the month, all of which was recurring. I have updated my forward-looking dividend summary for the acquisitions during the month. I included Q1 2016 as I feel that it's time to start looking into the coming year. I'm optimistic that I have received the last of the dividend cuts/suspensions in 2015. I anticipate that 2016 will be much stronger. I am going to take credit in the portfolio for the Verizon dividend increase even though it was announced earlier in September, before I added the position. But hey, an increase is an increase. That being said, Verizon was the only increase in the portfolio this month, they increased their dividend by 2.7%. I'm not sure if we're entering a bear market or not. With the volatility we've seen, it does not seem unreasonable to predict that we could be up over the coming quarter. On the contrary, I see us just as likely to see further selling and market declines. Despite the loss of value, I like the prices on many securities a lot better than I did this summer. I'm happy with my moves in September. Selling Molson at a gain gave me the chance to fill in my Fastenal position and begin a stake in Verizon. In the coming months I plan to continue adding shares in common stocks as a first priority, but I am also going to continue selectively adding shares of my REITs. REIT prices are pretty depressed right now, and could go lower if the Fed ever does raise rates. Lastly, I'm currently watching bank stocks, such as Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC ), US Bancorp (NYSE: USB ) and Associated Bancorp (NYSE: ASB ), as well as other dividend stalwarts such as Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO ) as potential future adds. I recently wrote about Coca-Cola ( HERE ), and if the price falls a little further, back closer to $38, I might start slowly adding a few shares. I will make an effort to share some of my research on bank stocks in an article later this month as well. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
