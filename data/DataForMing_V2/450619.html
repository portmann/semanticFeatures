These Investing Legends Have A Large Percentage Of Their Portfolio Invested In Apple | Seeking Alpha It is pretty rare that we find three separate Superinvestors simultaneously put more than 10% of their portfolios independently into the same stock. Today that is what we have with Apple where three of the best investors of the last 15 years have all made a very concentrated bet on the company. Our experience has been that when multiple Superinvestors independently make similar concentrated positions like this it is generally worth owning the company in question. We spend all of our time trying to get the very best ideas out of the portfolios of the best investors in the world. There are a few things that we look for that get us particularly interested: Multiple Superinvestors (that is what we call them) getting interested in the same stock at the same time A Superinvestor taking putting an unusually large percentage of his or her portfolio into a particular stock (suggests unique risk vs reward opportunity) A company that a Superinvestor owns having a significant amount of insider buying A company that a Superinvestor owns that has a clear catalyst on the horizon to trigger a positive investment return (such as an activist forcing a corporate action) Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) popped up on our list because it ticks the first two of those boxes. How Much Of His Portfolio - David Einhorn has 15.18% of Greenlight Capital's portfolio invested in Apple shares at the end of the first quarter 2016. That is a high conviction portfolio weighting. Why Should We Care What Einhorn Thinks - We should care what Einhorn thinks because despite a terrible 2015 the man has an excellent long term track record. Since starting Greenlight Capital in 1996 the firm has returned 16.5% to investors (after fees) and has only had two down years. We believe long term performance is a much better indicator of investing skill than one year of underperformance. What Does Einhorn Likely See In Apple - In the recent Greenlight Re (NASDAQ: GLRE ) earnings call Einhorn commented on why he owns Apple. His exact words were: We believe there is tremendous value in Apple's brand in growing global customer base that periodically buys new devices and increasingly buys additional services. A pretty simple yet hard to argue with explanation. He owns it because it is cheap and believes it has a powerful brand. How Much Of His Portfolio - Michael Burry has 16.00% of Scion Asset Management's portfolio invested in Apple shares at the end of the first quarter 2016. That is a high conviction portfolio weighting from a very concentrated manager. We can't give you Burry's top ten holdings because he only has 8 stocks listed with the SEC in his most recent quarterly filing. Why Should We Care What Burry Thinks - From November 2000 until June 2008 when he shuttered his initial fund Burry returned 489% to investors (after his 20% performance fee). The S&P 500 returned 3% over this time. That is an incredible performance and we are thrilled that he has returned to managing money so that we can piggyback on his ideas. What Does Burry See In Apple - It is impossible to know for sure exactly what Burry likes about Apple given he never speaks publicly about his investments. Given the value investing angle he used while running the first version of Scion we would be willing to bet that he is laser focused on cash flow. The image below shows the incredible amount of cash that Apple has brought in over the past three years. Over a three year period Apple has brought in $194 billion! For some perspective on how large that is consider that IBM's current market capitalization is less than $150 billion. If you are a follower of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A ) you will know that several years ago Warren Buffett brought in two investors to groom so that they could eventually take over management of Berkshire's equity portfolio. As you might expect of the only two investors that Buffett selected to share his portfolio with both Todd Combs and Ted Weschler are outstanding investors. In the first quarter of 2016 one of these gentlemen invested nearly a billion dollars in Apple. How Much Of His Portfolio - What we can't tell you is exactly what each of these men hold in their portion of the Berkshire portfolio. We know that each invest roughly $9 billion and that " One has seven or eight positions and the other one has maybe 13 or 14". Given that the Apple investment by Berkshire was close to a billion dollars it means that one of Weschler and Combs have put roughly 11% of their portfolio into Apple. Like Einhorn and Burry that is big weighting for one company and suggests a high level of conviction. Why Should We Care What Weschler Or Combs Think - This is a question that hardly seems in need of an answer. These men had an investing track record that was so good that Buffett was willing to give them a significant chunk of the Berkshire portfolio to manage. There is no bigger compliment than that. Since joining Berkshire Buffett has continued to be impressed with how Combs and Weschler have performed. Here are Buffett's words from the 2015 Berkshire shareholder letter: A personal thank-you: The PCC acquisition would not have happened without the input and assistance ofour own Todd Combs, who brought the company to my attention a few years ago and went on to educateme about both the business and Mark. Though Todd and Ted Weschler are primarily investment managers- they each handle about $9 billion for us - both of them cheerfully and ably add major value to Berkshirein other ways as well. Hiring these two was one of my best moves. What Do Weschler/Combs See In Apple - Like with Burry these guys don't speak publicly about their investments. We would guess that like Burry and Einhorn the attraction to Apple relates to its strong cash flow and brand power. For Berkshire the income stream from dividends is also a benefit as it provides more cash for these great investors to work with. With the $194 million of cash that Apple has generated over the past three years (mentioned earlier) Apple has paid dividends of: In total that is $136.2 billion of cash returned to investors which is surely a multiple of the next largest three year return of capital in history. All three of the investors profiled here have a double digit percentage of his portfolio in Apple. These are investors with proven long term track records of outperformance. That doesn't guarantee success with Apple as an investor from here but it sure gets us interested.
