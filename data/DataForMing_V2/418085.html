Disney: So Much Growth - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Disneyland in Shanghai stands to be an excellent catalyst for the firm and comes at a time where pressure needs to be taken off of ESPN. The summer box office will be much more lucrative for Disney, even compared to last year. Disney (NYSE: DIS ) is continually hovering around the $100 level. It's been a rollercoaster ride for shareholders since August 2015, when the shares peaked above $120 and then crashed, along with the broader equity market. With fears around ESPN really becoming front and center over the last few quarters, shareholders need to remember that this company has a significant amount of growth potential remaining. There are several key catalysts that Disney has in its arsenal that warrant a price target of $120+ and a buy rating. The best thing about Disney in the current market is that the company still has many tangible growth catalysts that can help rid the market of recent disappointment of the Q1 ER. Also, since the ESPN subscriber loss issue is continually being worked on by Disney's management, these catalysts serve to offset these financial losses. This is where investors should place their focus. This is a landmark event for Disney and this catalyst is positive for the stock in that it will create a lot of media attention, similar to how Star Wars: The Force Awakens generated investor interest. Fortunately, the benefit from this park and resort doesn't end there as it will reduce the financial burden on more weighted parts of the core business, like ESPN. Disney has maintained an 8.3% CAGR on park revenue since 2011 and is coming off its best performance ever last year. While the deal between Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) and Disney is critical in Disney's process to diversify out of ESPN-linked revenues, the Parks & Resorts impressive CAGR is going to allow it to help offset the losses experienced due to ESPN. This is even more true with Shanghai Disneyland now coming online. Below is the Parks & Resorts segment revenue for the last five years, as well as the 5Y forward projection that stems past the $23 billion mark. The importance of this is that Shanghai Disneyland is going to be a significant addition to Disney's Parks & Resorts segment as it will allow the company to maintain the strong CAGR it has experienced the last five years and carry it on through 2020. The only change in growth rate that I've projected is this year's growth rate because Disney is going to have to make up the expenses it invested in Shanghai. Thus, this initial year of operation will naturally make the park not as profitable as it could be. The completion of this park is also critical in that Disney will likely generate a stronger level of free cash flow in the upcoming years as this park and resort has been a significant investment source. Since 2011, capex has risen approximately $700 million, from $3.5 billion to $4.2 billion. This park and resort has incurred over $5.5 billion worth of investment. This potential for increased FCF is crucial because it means that Disney can increase its dividend past the sub-par rate that it's currently at or it can accelerate an authorized buyback. Both options return more capital to shareholders in a shorter period of time. I really advise that investors watch the company's operating margin in 2015 compared to 2017 and beyond as it will be key in seeing how profitable Shanghai Disney is compared to Disney's other parks. Additionally, if the park is consistently generating a strong rate of return, future parks and resorts can be built in Asia, creating a continuous cycle of growth within this segment. Shanghai Disneyland opens up June 16, just a few weeks away. Disney already has three strong films in the box office at the present moment with The Jungle Book, Zootopia, and Captain America: Civil War. This is one more than last year when Disney had Avengers: Age of Ultron and Cinderella. The only way that Disney posts lower box office numbers than last year is if attention is directed away from their summer blockbusters towards the election news coverage or towards the Olympics in August. Other films that Disney has at the box office this summer are Alice Through The Looking Glass and Pete's Dragon. However, don't expect either of these to cause material shifts in the company's stock due to their low probable sales relative to the other films in Disney's arsenal. Perhaps shareholders are forgetting that Finding Dory is on track to not only be the highest grossing animated movie this year, but a significant help in Disney reaching the Street's EPS target of $5.82. Again, this should help to offset any loss in viewers to the election and/or the Olympics. I'm mostly focusing on Finding Dory and Captain America: Civil War beating their domestic box office sales against expectations. If Disney can do this, it'll post significant YOY growth that will undoubtedly serve as a strong rationale for investors to buy the stock. The consensus estimates is that these two films are to do a combined $1.75 billion in global box office sales, however Captain America has already crushed the $1.07 billion mark, with at least another weak in major global theaters. If Finding Dory can surpass the $700 million mark, expectations will be beat. The reason I find this to be more than probable is that the average gross for the top 10 Pixar movies is well over $700 million. Additionally, for a sequel film, there's precedents in Toy Story 3 grossing $1.06 billion at the box office, and considering that Finding Nemo was the #2 Pixar film grossing $896 million worldwide, the follow-on film, if it is equally as successful, will help Disney surpass expectations. Disney Cruise Line should not be new to investors, but the company is planning on launching two new ships in 2021 and 2023. Why is this important to the overall business and to shareholders? Each cruise ship, as of now, averages $220.55 million in revenue each quarter based upon 2015 and 2016 Q1 data. While this seems like a small fraction of the $5.92 billion average quarterly revenue in the same time frame, it leads to an EPS impact of $0.09 per quarter, or about 7% of GAAP diluted EPS per quarter. The cruise ships' financial performance are included in the Parks & Resorts segment, which is rather interesting when investors think about the major catalyst that is the new Shanghai park and resort. Cruise ships, on average, showed a revenue increase of 8.2% in 2015, but did decrease to just 5.2% growth in Q1 2016, underperforming YOY. Given that this is a seasonal part of Disney's business, the largest increases in performance should occur in the spring and summer, the latter of which is right around the corner. So, while this summer will likely see the traditional support from the Cruise Line, it's important to consider the new ships a long-term catalyst. GAAP diluted EPS, right now, is growing at about 12.8% per quarter. With the addition of two new cruise ships, another 4.5 cents in EPS could be added each quarter, which would increase the bottom line growth rate past current expectations. This catalyst isn't without its cost, however, as these cruise ships will cost a cool $1 billion each and nearly half a decade to build. Again, this is a long-term catalyst, but nonetheless important because it can impact the bottom line and lead to future earnings beats. Disney has a great mix of positive catalysts that can more than help solve the subscriber loss problem from ESPN. Disney Shanghai is the spotlight right now, given that the park will open shortly, and it will be a significant top-line addition after 2016. Disney Studios continues to impress with a high-quality suite of films this summer and Disney Cruise Line looks to be a long-term earnings boost with the addition of two ships after 2020. Disney is finding ways to protect itself against industry trends like cord cutting and will be able to return more cash to shareholders in quarters to come because of their decisive actions today.
