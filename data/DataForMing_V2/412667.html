Apple, suppliers gain following report of strong iPhone 7 production orders - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha May 23 2016, 10:53 ET | About: Apple Inc. (AAPL) | By: Eric Jhonsa, SA Eye on Tech , SA News Editor Taiwan's Economic Daily News reports Apple ( AAPL +1.7%) has ordered contract manufacturers to produce 72M-78M iPhone 7 units this year, a record figure for a new iPhone and above analyst estimates of ~65M. Apple is outperforming on a day the Nasdaq is up 0.3%. As are chip suppliers Cirrus Logic ( CRUS +3.1%), Skyworks ( SWKS +3.3%), Qorvo ( QRVO +2.7%), and InvenSense ( INVN +4.6%). Over in Taipei, Foxconn parent Hon Hai Precision ( OTC:HNHAF ) rose 4.6%, and fellow iPhone manufacturer Pegatron ( OTC:PGTRF ) rose 9.9%. TSMC ( TSM +2.7%), which is believed to be the exclusive manufacturer of Apple's A10 processor (expected to go into the iPhone 7), is also doing well. The report comes with Apple having guided calendar Q2 revenue to be down 13%-17% Y/Y due to soft iPhone 6S sales. The rumor mill has indicated the iPhone 7 will feature a dual-camera array and a 256GB storage option, and do away with the 3.5mm headphone jack. The 9.7" iPad Pro's improved display suggests display enhancements are also possible. @exposethetruth Apple has a good record not accumulate inventory. If anything there are short of units new products creating weeks to fulfill. That is one reason many lineup online to be the first to order. I am ready to be on that line for the 7. Of course they could front end load the orders, then when actual ip7 sales come in far below estimates they can scale back and new orders to minimize losses. Its important for AAPL watchers to understand that if the the Nikkei report is true, its good for apple suppliers but means nothing for AAPL prospects. Companies will generally get a good idea of demand from their customers through guidance before creating supply so they don't end up with huge amounts of leftover stock. Do remember that a huge amount of Iphone users had still not upgraded from previous models which generally means they are due for an upgrade. Sales from the 5,6,7 etc always have and probably will always be bigger than their 's' version counterparts. @exposed funny because if the report had been the opposite direction (<65M consensus) you would have said it definitely kills "AAPL prospects". No matter what news comes out at least exposed, dizzy, Benji, et al are predictable and that's comforting at least. Exposethetruth: yes orders may be revised or decreased, but this is unlikely to happen until Q4. When apple releases a new phone, they build up inventory during Q3 and announce and start selling the phone at the end of Q3/beginning of Q4. They always make sure they have large inventories before their announcements, so that they can handle the lines of people at their stores. For suppliers this means that Q3 will almost certainly be inline with the initial level of orders. If this report is true, it means that the initial level of orders is relatively high, so Q3 sales should be high. Yes, but this is great optimism. I've been waiting for the 7 myself. How does one listen to music / sound without a headphone jack? When Apple did away with Centronics Parallel ports, the techies screamed When Apple did away with the RS232/422 ports, the techies screamed When Apple did away with the floppy disk, the techies screamed When Apple did away with the internal CD/DVD, the techies screamed the new bluetooth Beats earphones already have 6 hours of battery life. More than enough time to listen to music through earphones in the day. I have BT headphones for my MP3 player - awesome for listening to music while working out or working in the yard, no stupid cord to get in the way - can't believe AAPL hasn't gone this way already - wonder about interference though? Then there will be the other impact of the SE which still seems to be understocked.   I wonder how current production mix looks : proportion 6s plus, 6s, 6SE???!   I suspect strongly leaning SE? I hope Apple comes out with more memory in one fabricated unit: what you pay determines how much is switched "on" : much like cloud storage expands.  memory is so cheap now, changing channel inventory wipes out the cost difference between a 16 and a 64 very easily.     It would vastly simplify their supply chain and channel inventory, something I'd have thought Mr Cook would appreciate (send me shares instead of royalties please!) MacAfrican, I like this idea. Tesla ships higher batter sizes by default, and you can "enable" the larger sizes by paying an upgrade. The upgrade itself is unlocked by software. if they use a lightning port it opens up a lot of options to make headphones "smarter". the 3.5 jack is now about 30 years old. it may very well be time for something new. Went to visit my cousin this weekend for the first time in about a year. They have a big family under 1 roof. Him, his wife, his mother in law, his brother in law, his 8 year old daughter, his 4 year old daughter and his 3 month old son. As I looked around, here is what I saw: I have a Samsung washing machine. Other than some difficulty getting small parts, it works fine. Staying with Apple on consumer electronics for now. Btw, am I the only one seen the importance of margins here. Apple SE is $299 , that means higher sales to maintain or increase profitability relative to pre-years. I was! But I m looking for opportunities to get in. So far no incentive in that regard. Sticking walmart instead. I wish Apple's CFO, accounting dept, CEO and Board members were as intelligent as Jaliya!! Thank you Jaliya for your unique insight! As I hv beat markets from the age of 18(now 25) I really don't care of ur opinion on me. Made dollars and will continue make dollars as usual. It's the 2 year upgrade cycle after the massive iPhone 6 upgrade boom. I'd expect at least an echo boom this year, more than is reflected in current sentiment. If QRVO soars on iPhone 7 like it did on iPhone 6, not going to let those profits slip through of my fingers this time - more good news for QRVO: "Qorvo's newest family of small cell PAs targets distributed antenna systems, or DAS. Systems using these PAs can eliminate the need for linearization or digital pre-distortion (DPD) correction, reducing system complexity. Qorvo's eight new PAs cover 3GPP bands between 1.8-2.4 GHz and are pin-for-pin compatible. Qorvo's multi-stage PAs integrate matching in a low-cost surface mount package to allow for compact system design. With superior linear performance at -47dBc ACLR using a 20 MHz LTE signal, the TQP92xx product family provides 24dBm average linear power, and the TQP94xx family provides 27dBm average linear power.
