Greek Tragedy May Bring Excellent Buying Opportunity For Disney Shares - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha The stock appears fairly valued on next year's earnings estimates and earnings growth potential while carrying great earnings growth expectations for the near- and long-term. The dividend is pretty small right now but the company has decent financial efficiency ratios. I'm worried that the Greek drama will unfold into a market selloff and that's why I'm waiting on buying shares in the stock. The last time I analyzed Disney (NYSE: DIS ), I stated, "The fair valuation right now makes me shy away from investing any more money into the name right now but if it ever pulls back to $95.92 consider me a buyer." Since that time I've held steady and haven't bought any shares. After the article was published the stock increased slightly by 1.08% versus the 1.05% drop the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA: SPY ) posted. Disney is a diversified worldwide entertainment company which operates in five business segments: Media Networks, Parks and Resorts, Studio Entertainment, Consumer Products and Interactive. On May 5, 2014, the company reported fiscal second quarter earnings of $1.23 per share, which beat the consensus of analysts' estimates by $0.13. In the past year, the company's stock is up 34.64% and is beating the S&P 500, which has gained 8.48% in the same time frame. With all this in mind, I'd like to take a moment to evaluate the stock on a fundamental, financial and technical basis to see if it's worth buying shares of the company right now for my portfolio. The company currently trades at a trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 23.98, which is fairly priced, but I mainly like to purchase a stock based on where the company is going in the future as opposed to what it has done in the past. On that note, the 1-year forward-looking P/E ratio of 19.59 is currently fairly priced for the future in terms of the right here, right now. The 1-year PEG ratio (1.95), which measures the ratio of the price you're currently paying for the trailing 12-month earnings on the stock while dividing it by the earnings growth of the company for a specified amount of time (I like looking at a 1-year horizon), tells me that the company is fairly priced based on a 1-year EPS growth rate of 12.3%. The company has great near-term future earnings growth potential with a projected EPS growth rate of 12.3%. In addition, the company has great long-term future earnings growth potential with a projected EPS growth rate of 15.18%. Below is a table of how the fundamentals snapshot each time I've written about the stock. On a financial basis, the things I look for are the dividend payouts, return on assets, equity and investment. The company pays a dividend of 1.03% with a payout ratio of 25% of trailing 12-month earnings while sporting return on assets, equity and investment values of 9.4%, 17.8% and 12%, respectively, which are all respectable values. Because I believe the market may get a bit choppy here and would like a safety play, I don't believe the 1.03% yield of this company alone is good enough alone for me to take shelter in for the time being. The company has been increasing its dividends for the past 5 years at a 5-year dividend growth rate of 19.7%. Below is a comparison table of the financial metrics for when I wrote all articles pertaining to the company. Looking first at the relative strength index chart [RSI] at the top, I see the stock in middle ground territory with a current value of 59.28. I will look at the moving average convergence-divergence [MACD] chart next. I see that the black line is just crossing above the red line with the divergence bars increasing in height which tells me bullish momentum is about to start in the name. As for the stock price itself ($111.49), I'm looking at $113.22 to act as resistance and the 50-day simple moving average (currently $109.44) to act as support for a risk/reward ratio which plays out to be -1.84% to 1.55%. Though the company has Star Wars coming up later this year, the investment in DraftKings, and the Shanghai park opening up next year I wish I had the guts to buy this stock. Owning it already is half the battle, the other half is buying more shares at a better price. I'm just hoping that this Greek drama that's taking place can bring down the price of the stock so that I can buy some more shares. Fundamentally I believe the company to be fairly valued now on next year's earnings estimates and on earnings growth potential with great near- and long-term earnings growth expectations. Financially the company pays a small dividend and has decent financial efficiency ratios which are increasing. On a technical basis the risk/reward ratio shows me there is more risk than reward right now. I want to see how this Greek drama plays out to see if I can get a better entry level.
