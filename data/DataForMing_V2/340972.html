Apple: What Will Excite Investors? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Analyst Gene Munster has provided thoughts on Apple's upcoming capital return announcement. Does a $30 billion increase move the needle? $50 billion? On Friday, we received some comments from analyst Gene Munster regarding the expected update to Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) capital return plan at the April earnings report. Over the next six weeks or so, we will likely be hearing from many more analysts, bloggers and others talking about what to expect (see my dividend thoughts here ). But with so much focus right now on product sales, primarily the decline in iPhone shipments, will investors really care about the expected buyback increase? First, consider what Munster detailed. He believes Apple will raise its dividend by 5-10%. That would put the new dividend in a range of 54.6 to 57.2 cents, although Apple is likely to use half or whole cents for its quarterly payout. Munster also believes Apple will tack on $30-$50 billion to the buyback, which he says will boost EPS by about 5% per year going forward. When Apple finished its December 2015 quarter, the company had $30 billion left on the buyback, as per the 10-Q filing . An average quarter would likely mean about $5 billion in share repurchases, although the low stock price during calendar Q1 2016 might have caused management to step in and buy more shares. A recent debt raise was probably executed to help in this process. So even if we say the company spends $10 billion during the current quarter, there will still be $20 billion left for share repurchases. This amount was originally expected to be utilized by March 2017, as detailed in last year's capital return update announcement . The chart below shows the history of Apple's buyback authorizations. Source: Apple financial filings page As I've always stated, the dollar amount of the buyback is really meaningless in and of itself, as the more important item is the timing involved. A one-year, $30 billion buyback is more influential in the short term than say a 10-year, $100 billion buyback. This is why I think investors will have a muted reaction to the increased amount, and the raise is only going to be a fraction of the total. With $140 billion already on the books, does another $30 billion really get you excited? Probably not, and I doubt that's the case with $50 billion either, if we use Munster's projections. From the investors I've talked with on Seeking Alpha, most say the more important part of the capital return plan is the dividend. If Apple were to surprise and announce a huge hike, say 25% or more, they would get more excited about the stock. A 2.02% annual yield now is not that enticing for income investors compared to other large cap tech names that offer 3-4% or more a year. Should Apple go to say 2.75% a year and hike the buyback by $50 billion, investors' eyes might water a bit. But from what Munster has said, and I mostly agree, a large dividend hike is probably not coming this year. Additionally, investors would like to hear from management about their plan for a return to revenue (and earnings) growth. Sure, this month's announcement of a new iPhone and iPad will get some people to upgrade , but at best that probably puts the company at flat revenues for the fiscal year. The changing wireless environment in the US has also caused some challenges. I believe a number of consumers aren't too thrilled with $30 a month or more payments just for a phone. IDC recently provided this summary of the iPhone's current state: iOS: 2015 was a tremendous year for Apple and the iPhone as shipments hit a new record of 231.5 million for growth of 20.2% over 2014, which was nearly double that of the overall smartphone market. More importantly, Apple was able to grow its ASP from $663 in 2014 to $713 in 2015. The continued upgrades to the newer, pricier iPhones were the primary catalyst for increasing ASPs at a time when the majority of the market is chasing low-cost models. IDC expects 2016 to be relatively flat regarding iPhone volume. However, growth should return in 2017 and beyond as its trade-in programs will expand into markets outside of North America and help drive churn. IDC forecasts Apple will see about 231 million shipments this year, with growth to 269 million by 2020. However, that growth is expected to lag the overall market, and Apple is forecast to lose a point or so of global smartphone share. The "race to the bottom" is likely to blame, as IDC forecasts the average smartphone price to fall to $237 in 2020 from $295 in $2015. Apple is dominating the upper end of the price spectrum, but will need to come down the ladder a bit if it wants to really increase market share, and get to 300 million units a year or more in the next couple of years. The return to growth for the iPhone (and iPad too?) is likely to be the bigger story over the next few quarters for Apple, so I'm not sure how much a buyback increase will really excite investors. In the coming weeks, I expect to hear a number of analysts coming out with their predictions, but what's another $30 billion or so among friends? Investors would be happier with a large dividend raise, plus a plan to get iPhone sales going again. If you are an Apple investor now or perhaps looking to be one, how much of a buyback increase (and give a time frame!) would move the needle for you? Please join the discussion in the comments below.
