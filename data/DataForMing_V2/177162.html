The MnM Portfolio Supplement - Trading Molson Coors For Telecommunications - Molson Coors Brewing Company (NYSE:TAP) | Seeking Alpha Molson Coors share price surged earlier this week on news of merger talk in the alcoholic beverages industry. It was an interesting week in the alcoholic beverages segment, when Anheuser-Busch Inbev (NYSE: BUD ) announced that it was intending to make a bid to purchase SABMiller (( OTCPK:SBMRY ), traded over the counter). The news of this potential merger sent shares in my holding of Molson Coors (NYSE: TAP ) surging, going up nearly 10% for the year, and leaving me sitting with a nice gain. Source: Yahoo Finance, 18 September 2015 I will be honest and say that after holding TAP for a year I was not terribly excited with it. The stock features a 2% yield, which is average, and while management has begun growing it again recently, it does not have a great long-term track-record. Further, since purchasing the stock in 2014, the share price had not held up terribly well either, as preceding the run-up in price, I was sitting at a decent loss. I will admit that ever since I first invested in the company, I have been slightly uncomfortable with the threat posed by the growing craft beer industry (personally I like craft beers as much, if not more than Molson's brands). I'm sure that over time there will be mergers and acquisitions leading to consolidation in this fragmented segment of the market, but in the near term, the growth in this part of the industry poses challenges to the traditional large-scale brewers. While I haven't seen statistics from 2014, I do know that craft breweries saw excellent growth through 2013, as evidenced by the following statistics released by the Brewers Association which claims significant volume share growth in recent years. Source: Brewers Association Press Release, 13 March 2014 So, when I saw the opportunity to capture some gains, I had to take it. I realized a gain of $340.74, or 11.55% on my initial purchase price. Most importantly, this gave me the flexibility to move the funds into securities that I am more excited about. I have increasingly felt it is important to get a telecommunications company into my portfolio. Why? Historically these companies served only the function of allowing us to communicate with one another, but as we have seen, and will likely increasingly see, the telecommunications companies are moving to be more of a content delivery service than merely a communications medium. You can thank smartphones for a large part of this. I see all of us continuing to gobble up more and more data as we connect more and more devices. I want to profit from this. Plus, you really can't argue against the outsized yield that these companies pay. So that left me with the age-old question of which telecom stock to buy, Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) or AT&T (NYSE: T ). Note that neither T-Mobile (NYSE: TMUS ) nor Sprint (NYSE: S ) pays a dividend, so I will not invest in either of them. When I look over the fundamentals of Verizon and AT&T I find that they are pretty similar, a little bit sluggish in the dividend growth, but both have nice yields and are trading well off of their normalized P/E multiples per fastgraphs.com Source: Dividend growth rates were obtained from David Fish's U.S. Dividend Champions spreadsheet available at dripinvesting.org, price and P/E data was obtained from fastgraphs.com Source: Fastgraphs.com 18 September 2015 I chose to purchase Verizon, as fundamentally it's trading at a slightly better multiple than AT&T, and on a non-fundamental basis I like their network better and am not altogether convinced that DirecTV will be a windfall for AT&T. I was not terribly impressed with their service having used them for five years. Either way, if you were to invest in AT&T or Verizon, you will likely do fine, particularly with the stocks selling as cheap as they are right now. Using most of the proceeds of the TAP sale, I purchased 35 shares of Verizon at $44.99 and 40 shares of Fastenal (NASDAQ: FAST ) at $37.37. I have discussed my interest in Fastenal already, so feel free to find my rationale for owning the stock in my last article . If you're currently a holder of Molson Coors stock, I would consider taking profits on the proposed merger speculation, as at this point that is all it is, speculation. I would think that any merger of the alcoholic beverage giants is likely to face scrutiny by the government, on fears that it will be anti-competitive and result in a company with outsized market share. Further, if the failed merger attempts by Sysco (NYSE: SYY ) and Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) tell us anything, mergers of this scale are anything but certain in the current business climate. At current prices, the market is betting that Molson will benefit from this merger, but it's hard to know if they will ultimately benefit at all, or at least more than is already reflected in the price. I violated one of my core principles of not selling, but I found this to be a rare opportunity to drop a stock I was not terribly excited about (at a gain) to get into stocks that I am much more excited about. Overall, I sense that Verizon, AT&T and Fastenal are all on sale, with great long-term prospects, so it's hard to argue against any of them. Disclosure: I am/we are long VZ, FAST.
