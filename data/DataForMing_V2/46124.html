Why Apple Won't Have A $1 Trillion Market Capitalization Any Time Soon - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha To screen ETFs by asset class, performance, yield and more, check out the ETF Hub. ETF Hub Many analysts expect AAPL's market cap to reach $1 trillion in the next year. That's unlikely due to its current buyback plan. It's even more unlikely given the likelihood of a bigger buyback program and what AAPL will have to do in order to add $350 billion plus to its valuation. With two consecutive blowout quarters, a market capitalization of $750 billion and a forward P/E ratio under 12 minus cash, many think a $1 trillion valuation for Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is possible within the year. After all, it seems inevitable, and while I believe Apple will one day be a trillion-dollar company, I do think it will be several years down the road. The simple reason why Apple won't reach $1 trillion anytime soon can be seen in the chart below, a comparison of its market capitalization versus stock gains since September 2012. This also represents the start of Apple's historically large buyback program, which also explains the disconnect between market capitalization and stock price. Despite its stock being nearly 27% higher since September 18, 2012, Apple's market capitalization has only increased 11.5%. The reason is because Apple has rapidly reduced its shares outstanding during this span via buybacks to the tune of 13%. That's why Apple's stock has outperformed its market cap by nearly 100%, reflecting the market's attempt to apply a higher value to Apple and reflect its very significant fundamental improvements. That said, Apple spent $45 billion on buybacks last year and then $7 billion during the first quarter. This buyback activity suggests that investors must continue to buy Apple's stock at a pace that outperforms the rate at which Apple will buy its own stock. The problem is that in order for Apple's market capitalization to rise over the next two years, investors must be much more aggressive than in years past. The reason is Apple's new buyback plan, increasing its current plan from $90 billion to $140 billion . After what Apple has already spent on this plan, it is left with $88 billion to spend on share repurchases. This is a plan that runs through March of 2017, implying that Apple will be very aggressive regardless of the stock price. Furthermore, despite Apple's willingness to spend billions quarter-after-quarter on buybacks, its cash balance continues to rise. At the end of the first quarter, Apple had over $193 billion in cash and equivalents . While $171 billion of that cash is overseas, Apple has historically used debt markets to fund buyback programs. With that in mind, investors must assume that Apple's remaining $88 billion for buybacks will be met with another $50 to $100 billion by the time its current $140 billion plan ends in two years. After all, Apple has increased its buyback program annually since it was first announced a couple years back, suggesting that $88 billion will likely become much higher over the next two years. Furthermore, Apple's annual buybacks have increased in each of the last two years, and the first quarter's $7 billion in spending, up from $5 billion in the first quarter of last year, puts 2015 on an even higher spending level than 2014. As a result, I'm estimating that Apple spends $130 billion on buybacks over the next two years. While speculative, this adds to my belief that Apple will increase its buyback allowance during this time, as cash will only rise and Apple must find somewhere to return that cash to shareholders. At this time, buybacks are the best way to return capital, as evident in the chart above. Therefore, if Apple's stock were to remain flat from now until March 2017, and Apple spent $130 billion to buy back stock, its market capitalization would be $620 billion. In order to support Apple's current market capitalization, the stock would have to trade higher by 21% during this span. To reach a trillion-dollar valuation, Apple would have to trade higher by over 60%. While very possible that Apple trades higher by 60% over the next two years, I find it highly unlikely over the next 12 months as some analysts expect. Personally, I think it will be closer to three years, and that's if Apple continues to gain market share with smartphones and has several successful new product launches over the next 24 months. In my opinion, $1 trillion is easier said than done, as the investor support needed to achieve such a feat is unprecedented, needing to add another $380 billion in market capitalization by the time its buyback program is complete, that's assuming Apple's buybacks aren't larger than $130 billion. All things considered, investors should keep in mind that despite a record first quarter where the average selling price of iPhones rose, its dividend was increased, and its buyback plan hiked by $50 billion, Apple's stock still fell. This essentially highlights the level of perfection Apple must achieve in order to add another $380 billion in market capitalization to its stock. It's that continued need for perfection and the effect that buybacks will have on Apple's market capitalization that makes me believe that a $1 trillion market capitalization is unlikely any time soon, if ever, depending on Apple's future buyback plans. In all reality, investors should be happy that a $1 trillion market capitalization is nowhere near in sight. Back in 2012, before Apple begun its steep stock fall, a $700 price target was almost universal by analysts. Once that target was hit, the stock began to fall despite continued fundamental growth from the company. If $1 trillion is a similar psychological limit, it could signal the next stock decline, as investors will be left wondering where Apple goes from there. With that said, at today's level Apple looks very attractive and thanks to the company's willingness to keep buying back stock at record amounts, investors should feel confident that Apple's stock will continue to outperform the market regardless of market capitalization growth. Apple is essentially handing investors stock gains with its large buybacks, keeping a potential psychological limit in the distance, and all the while accumulating even more cash to both reinvest in the business and fund larger buybacks in the future. Thus, Apple's buybacks are a great thing for investors, even if it prolongs expectations for Apple to soon become the first ever trillion-dollar company.
