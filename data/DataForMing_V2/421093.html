SunTrust's Peck: Three pricing scenarios for Yahoo bids - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha Jun  1 2016, 15:20 ET | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Second-round bidding for the core assets of Yahoo ( YHOO -2.5%) is coming in this week, and SunTrust's Bob Peck has taken a look at the remaining bidders and laid out three scenarios depending on just which assets make up the package. Peck reiterated his Buy on the company with a price target of $44; Shares are trading at $37 today, implying 19% upside. In a low-end scenario -- the assets draw $2B-$4B, in line with a recent WSJ report -- it's viable for a private equity firm to bid there, he says, looking at debt and ROE ratios and assuming cuts of about 2,000 employees. A slightly higher outcome is another scenario: “Leveraging the above math to justify the lower level of the range, we think there are two other assets one could add to Scenario 1 that would either be excluded from 'the core' sale or would be additive to the price": Net present value of the Yahoo Japan royalty for $1B and PP&E of $750M. The high-end scenario ($6B-$8B) is reserved for strategic bidders, he writes, who will justify the premium over the mid-line scenario valuing IP at $1B and pursuing more layoffs than others. I do not see the same bidder that wants YHOO Finance wanting YHOO Sports or YHOO Mail? I may be wrong. I cannot believe that anybody would pay a premium for this company when their biggest holder in Softbank walks away with a sweet deal that Marissa and crew will NEVER get.
