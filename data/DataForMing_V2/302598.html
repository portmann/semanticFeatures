(AAPL) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor Down just moderately after hours in the wake of its mixed FQ1 results and soft FQ2 guidance - some bad news was priced in following chip supplier warnings and iPhone order cut reports - Apple ( AAPL -4.5%) is seeing steeper losses today. Several chip suppliers are also off. Not surprisingly, many on the Street are nervous about earnings call remarks regarding macro pressures in general, and Chinese pressures in particular. However, bulls are also taking heart in Apple's efforts to highlight services growth - reported FQ1 services revenue rose 26% Y/Y to $6.1B, and Apple asserts its installed base drove nearly $9B in related purchases (+24% Y/Y). With revenue guided to drop 9%-14% Y/Y in FQ2, future iPhone growth is also the subject of much debate. Macquarie's Ben Schachter (Outperform, $117 target): "The company rang the alarm bells loud and clear on macro weakness ... Cook put something of a line in the sand in implying that the March qtr would be the trough for iPhone unit growth ... the new disclosures confirm our thesis that the % of profit contribution from Services is almost 2x its % of revs, i.e., Services should contribute almost 20% of profits in FY’16 despite representing only about 10% of revs." Deutsche's Sherri Scribner (Hold, $105 target): "We remain concerned about the lack of growth in iPhone units this year, the slowdown in China sales, and gross margin pressure from FX as we move through the year ... With AAPL becoming a recurring revenue story, we expect the valuation to rerate in line with other mature, services-type companies." Susquehanna's Chris Caso (Positive, $140 target): "We think the question about whether iPhone can grow was, however, a more relevant argument when the stock was higher. With the stock at its current level (AAPL’s free cash flow yield is now in excess of 10%), we think the more relevant question now is whether iPhone can continue to generate cash at similar levels over a reasonable investment horizon ... Nonetheless, what’s ultimately needed for AAPL to be viewed as a growth stock once again is for them to once again simply invent something new that will have the impact of the iPod, iPhone or iPad." (ed: could an electric car do the job?) Other opinions: 1) Jan Dawson still sees plenty of room to cross-sell new products/services to a base of 1B+ active users. 2) VentureBeat's Chris O'Brien thinks more transparency is needed on Apple Watch/Apple TV sales and services revenue (among other things). 3) 9to5 Mac's Ben Lovejoy argues it's time for Apple might need to rethink iPhone pricing in light of macro/forex pressures and competition. On SA, Bill Maurer notes Apple disclosed 60% of iPhone owners haven't upgraded to an iPhone 6/6+ or 6S/6S+, and that a rumored new 4" iPhone could appeal to some of them. Paulo Santos , on the other hand, is skeptical a new 4" iPhone will provide a big lift, and considers FQ1's 25% Y/Y iPad unit drop "more serious than it looks."
