Should Apple Copy Samsung's Promotional Success? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge were heavily promoted. Samsung increased unit sales in Q1 according to Gartner. There's no debate that Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPhone sales are struggling at the moment. Whether it be a changing US carrier environment, lack of technology, a lengthening replacement cycle, etc., the company does need to figure things out as we approach the launch of the iPhone 7. Recently, Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) has done a great job with the launch of its S7 line, but there's a major caveat here, one that Apple may not be willing to explore. Samsung has been the leading smartphone vendor for a while now, and in the chart below you can see how the company outsold Apple by almost 30 million units in Q1 2016. While Samsung did show a small increase over the prior year period, it did lose some market share thanks to gains made by smaller competitors. (Source: Gartner Q1 data, examined here ) The market share gap could expand during the second calendar quarter of 2016, Apple's fiscal third quarter, thanks to strong initial sales of Samsung's new S7 model line. However, according to Kantar's Lauren Guenveur, Samsung went all in this year with a very large promotional strategy : "The Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge appears to be one of the most heavily promoted phones, ever," she writes. "If you ordered an S7 before March 18th, you got a Gear VR and six VR games for free. AT&T and T-Mobile offered 'buy one, get one free' deals for a time. Best Buy included a Gear VR and a 64gb SIM card with the purchase of an S7. For purchasers of the S7 at Costco this month, they'll get a 32-inch Samsung HD TV. And that's barely scraping the surface of the promotions and trade-ins available for this device." Virtual reality sets, games, SIM cards, TVs and even 2 for 1s were offered in an effort to sell these phones. But Kantar also stated that Samsung got the specs right, including better battery life, camera quality and speed. I recently argued that Apple needs to work on its technology specs , going above and beyond what we saw with the 6s line and associated SE model. So to what extent will Apple go to get sales moving again? Well, we've already seen the iPhone upgrade program, which could be expanded to more markets. I also think an iPad upgrade program could help the struggling tablet as well. On the basis of items like this, Apple analyst Tony Sacconaghi recently detailed his idea for an Apple Family Plan, which he believes could look somewhat like this: His hypothetical example (his own family) requires 3 iPad Minis, 1 iPad Air - each with a three-year replacement cycle; and 3 iPhones, each with a 2-year replacement cycle. In his example, it could cost "only" about $140 per month, well below his current monthly cable bill and wireless bill. Adding Apple Music for $15 per month; iCloud storage for $10 per month; and a speculated but yet to be released OTTP television offering for $40 per month increases it to an estimated $207/month, still a savings. Obviously, Apple can't go as far as Samsung at the moment given the fact that Apple doesn't have a VR set or flat screen TV on the market. However, the company can do little things like perhaps give away a few more free months of Apple Music or some extra iCloud storage to entice consumers to buy an iPhone. Maybe the company decides to split its iPhone pricing tier when it launches the 7 later this year. In the end, however, it is all about keeping users in the Apple ecosystem. Obviously, the best way to increase overall sales is to reduce prices. Perhaps Apple should "pair up" products in an effort to boost sales of multiple devices. So maybe if you buy an iPhone 7 you get $25 off an Apple Watch, or $50 of an iPad Pro, for instance. I'm not suggesting Apple needs to go out and cut iPhone prices by $100 or something big like that, but little moves that go across product lines could work. Even though the company's gross margin percentage might take a small hit, Apple may actually be able to increase its gross margin dollars (and perhaps overall net income) if it is able to make up for it in sales volume. Samsung went very promotional with its launch of the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge this year, and the move seems to have paid off. While I don't think Apple would ever go this far with the launch of a new phone, I do think that the technology giant could learn a few lessons especially as the smartphone industry evolves. While having top tier technology is key, Apple could always use its other products as a way to increase iPhone and overall sales. This is key to getting revenues and earnings going again, which hopefully will lead to the company's shares heading higher.
