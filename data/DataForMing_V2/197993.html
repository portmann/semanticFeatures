Analog Devices Ready To Benefit From 3D Touch - Analog Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) | Seeking Alpha Analog Devices is a steady performer which pays a rising and dependable dividend of about 2.8%. ADI has good growth prospects with its proprietary technology, such as a popular touchscreen controller, that is being used by Apple to power its latest gadgets. The recent pullback in ADI stock provides a good value entry point and makes it a solid bet for the patient income investor. Analog Devices (NASDAQ: ADI ), a tech company that manufactures integrated circuits, has been one of my favorite tech stocks for years. It pays a solid dividend, has proprietary technology which gives it high margins, and is a major innovator in cutting-edge areas of user interface technology. I last wrote about ADI on September 2, 2014, when it closed at $54.59. It has had a bumpy year since then, along with the overall market, but is still trading several percent higher than when I wrote that article. Shareholders who bought last year should be pleased. Let's check in with ADI and see if it is still a good buy. The buzz around ADI is that it stands to benefit from its relationship with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ). Analog Devices has a good relationship with Apple as one of its major suppliers of several different products. For instance, ADI supplies the touchscreen controller that powers Apple's Force Touch in the Apple Watch. While buzz about the Apple Watch have been mixed, sales to loyal Apple customers have been solid . According to some reports , it had a more successful launch than some other fantastically successful Apple products. Others disagree and consider it a flop, so it depends who you ask. Apple is sure to nurture the development of the watch, since it is the company's first major new offering since the passing of Steve Jobs. It is not difficult to imagine it being a popular holiday gift. However, the Apple Watch is just one part of the puzzle. The ADI touchscreen controller also could find its way into other Apple products, such as the iPhone 6, iPad Pro and perhaps new versions of the venerable Macs. During the last conference call on 18 August 2015, CFO David Zinsner had this to say: Well, precision technology, we're attempting to leverage that across all of our end markets and all of our customers. The specific product that is driving some of the demand for next quarter is specific to one customer, and in a lot cases, we work with those customers to customize the technology for their needs, and obviously as we do that, we don't give that to another customer to be able to utilize. While the company has to be discrete about its customers, the "one customer" to whom he refers almost certainly is Apple. Analysts have been busy upgrading ADI recently. Citigroup and Evercore both upgraded ADI to Buy from Hold within the past month, while Sterne Agee initiated coverage at Buy. The third quarter of 2015 turned out to be another strong quarter for ADI, with revenue increasing to a record $863 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.77, both at the high-end of the range. Gross margin in the third quarter of 66.1% was down 40 basis points from the prior quarter and was well within our gross margin model range of 65% to 68%. The mention of margins was important because the rap against companies who supply Apple is that their margins get squeezed. That does not appear to be the case with ADI, at least so far. Analog Devices' fiscal year ends at the beginning of each November. Thus, the next earnings report will give the company's fiscal 2015 results. It is tentatively scheduled for 24 November 2015 before the market open. ADI pays a dependable quarterly dividend which it has been raising consistently for many years. The current annualized yield is around 2.8%. The ADI dividend is amply covered by free cash flows. Thus, even though the company's free cash flow varies, the dividend is never threatened.

As shown above, the forecasts are for earnings per share of $2.97 for fiscal 2015. Thus, earnings have rebounded nicely from their small slump in 2014. Institutional ownership is relatively high at almost 90%, led by Capital World Investors and Vanguard Group. The fact that institutions are so interested in ADI is a big positive, because institutions have extensive research tools to ferret out good value. Insiders overall have been sellers over the past year. However, the selling has largely dried up over the past few months, a period when the stock price was falling. Basically, they were exhibiting good timing, selling as the stock price peaked. ADI in a multi-year uptrend, but it has experienced an uncharacteristic price convulsion over the past year. After a dip that bottomed during the Ebola scare of October 2014, ADI went on a sustained uptrend that peaked in early June 2015. It since has dipped, and is forming a wedge. Chart patterns and technical analysis are always uncertain beings. They cannot be relied upon until they complete. However, many like to anticipate chart patterns as they form. A breakout above the 38.2% retracement line around $59 would be very bullish. Price chart of ADI, July 2014 - October 2015. Taking the start of the recent ADI uptrend at its lows in October 2014, and the end of that trend at its high of $68.97 in June 2015, a Fibonacci Retracement analysis shows that, since the peak, ADI's stock price has declined just past the 61.8% level.
