In a narrative-crushing print, US Services PMI dropped to 54.3 - the lowest since January 2015. Output and New business growth slumped to 11-month lows, optimism dropped, and input cost inflation continued to moderate as "suggests the pace of hiring has slowed since earlier in the year as businesses have become more cautious." Then, confirming  this plunge, ISM Services printed 55.3 - its lowest since March 2014 as unadjusted new orders collapsed to their lowest since February 2014. “The PMI surveys show the service sector losing momentum alongside a stalling of growth in the manufacturing sector, pushing the overall rate of economic expansion down to the weakest for a year." The survey also signals robust employment growth, but likewise suggests the pace of hiring has slowed since earlier in the year as businesses have become more cautious in the face of worries such as the forthcoming elections, the strong dollar, global growth jitters and the outlook for interest rates. The December survey data are consistent with non-farm payrolls rising by around 175,000 compared to an average of 200,000 in the first eleven months of the year.

(Professional, Scientific & Technical Services) "Holiday shopping volume is in line with forecast." (Retail Trade) "Currently very busy in the holiday rush season. Purchasing of supplies, postage & freight, and direct labor all more than double non-holiday periods."

They BUY congress to maintain this privileged position. It is in fact time to EXECUTE the middlemen!

Their correlation to the S&P is sinking further and further, just as it did before the collapse in August 2015. Since it is nearly impossible that transportation stocks will rise a lot in the next future, the S&P has to follow downwards to re-establish the near-100%-longterm-correlation.
