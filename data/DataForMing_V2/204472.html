2 Growth Stocks You May Want From The Market Selloff Discount Bin | Seeking Alpha The sudden stock market drop has opened up some nice share price discounts for two stocks. Amazon had a fantastic earnings result, but the gain that followed has been given back. Under Armour shed almost 7% in one day. yet expected earnings growth going forward is still high. Short stock market corrections like the one over the past several weeks are actually good for investors. During a strong bull market, you watch popular stocks get lifted up to much higher price multiples on market sentiment, and it's a little difficult to determine what's really supporting it. When the indexes quickly turn down and the froth is wiped away, you can better see how full the glass of value is. The traders will run for the exit, but that allows the stock to find firmer price support. That may not be the last of the declines if the market continues to dip, but now you have a price level gauge to compare market action to share price strength. Sifting through the bargain bin of the stocks that sold off, I noticed two stocks with good growth prospects that were offering nice discounts. Amazon ended the week down almost 7% at $494.47. Looking back over the month, the stock has given back most of the gains following its July 23 earnings release. There still remains a substantial portion of the gains achieved leading up to the earnings results. I want to see if the market will knock Amazon any further down over the next week to possibly test the $480 level. Amazon recently crushed the market earnings estimate, showing an unexpected profit. The company had a strong result for its Prime Day promotional sale earlier, which I think is a good sign for Fall and holiday sales performance. On top of that, Amazon's web service AWS raised its quarterly segment operating income from $77 million a year to $391 million. I don't think the growth is going to stop there. Amazon has turned over two good cards. This price drop is just an air pocket that the stock should recover quickly from if the sell-off is just the run-of-the-mill 10% correction. Under Armour actually held up well over the past week, that is, until Friday when it lost 6.8% in just one day. I'm not sure why investors waited that long to sell down. I don't think it had much to do with the China stock market tanking, so Under Armour could rebound quickly. That said, at $90.06, Under Armour is still trading at a pretty high forward earnings multiple of 62, which I noted earlier in the week was already high at 70. Analysts are expecting earnings to rise a little over 30% annually over the next several years. That's keeping the stock buoyant. If a little more of the heat came out of the stock, that would be a welcome move for investors. I want to see how the stock holds up over the next week around $90 after it closed the gap it made on July 23 when it reported earnings. Sales in the quarter were very strong, especially in footwear for the Curry One shoe named after NBA star Stephen Curry who wore them in the recent NBA Finals. The company is seeing substantial growth in overseas markets, with sales rising 93% on the year-ago period, and now generating 11% of total quarterly revenues. Online sales were also up in the high double-digits. The stock is still in its uptrend channel running since January. The price support level held in the sudden price fall, so I think the current price is a decent pullback level to start adding to positions from.
