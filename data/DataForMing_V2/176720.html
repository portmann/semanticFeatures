Sprint, Apple, And A Downgraded Credit Rating - Sprint Corporation (NYSE:S) | Seeking Alpha Thurman Dunn , God of Game Theory (115 clicks) The Sprint road to recovery recently hit a credit rating road bump. The downgraded credit rating was reasonable given the continually deteriorating cash position. Still, Sprint is making a strong push for a turnaround. If the trajectory of business prospects continues to improve, future prospects may well be good. Sprint (NYSE: S ) has not been able to keep forward momentum for long, before being knocked back by adversity. The company has been in a decade's long decline that just recently started to show signs of recovery. Still, that recovery has cost a bloody fortune, with free cash flow desperately negative. The current cash problem, as is often the case in business, was the result of multiple prior missteps in network strategy that left the company with an antiquated structure that was deeply unsatisfying to consumers. The network was unreliable, and offered intensely slower data speeds in comparison to competitors. This resulted in steep churn rates which caused falling revenues to combine with the large cash flow need to build out a competitive network: the net result has been billions in negative cash flow. As it is, the large CAPEX needed to turnaround network performance came along at a time when Sprint was at their competitive weakest. CEO Marcelo Claure pushed hard with steeply discounted prices in order to contain churn, Sprint spent gobs on network build out, and cash literally flew. And while the efforts have resulted in greatly rising RootMetrics rankings in network performance and much more positive churn rates, they have also created a financing concern and resulted in a deserved decrease in debt rating. Claure has stated his goal to have Sprint at number one or two in large cities by the end of 2017, and the stated plan shared between Claure and parent SoftBank is to contract lessors to build out a 70,000-unit small cell network . Given a reasonably healthy (and small cell advantageous) outlay of spectrum, if Sprint accomplishes this there is little reason to question that the carrier will produce strong network performance results. The combination of a much improved network with discounted pricing plans has clearly produced strong results as it relates to positive churn levels with Sprint. Though T-Mobile (NYSE: TMUS ) is still by far the best performing churn artist of the national cellular group, Sprint is gaining ground, and will likely continue the upwards trend as the year goes on. The rapidity with which Sprint has produced positive churn numbers in relationship to their increasing network performance is impressive: lag times are generally what we expect between network improvements and customer response, yet there has been very little lag for Sprint. Marcelo Claure has put a premium on customer convenience, and it has clearly produced a positive result. The recent vote of confidence by SoftBank ( OTCPK:SFTBF ) Chief Masa Son was likely influenced positively by the work that Claure has done: make no mistake about it, if Sprint does not succeed, it will not be due to a lack of effort by management. Strong churn numbers will obviously bolster market value for Sprint, but the bear in the room will continue to be free cash flow. In truth, both Claure and Son have acknowledged this in plans to create financial vehicles to remove phone financing from the ledger, along with continuing small cell build out. There is no free lunch, and so this process will inevitably result in expenses for Sprint, but the idea is clearly that a continual increase in network performance (along with price and handset plans) will produce churn gains that will eventually turn free cash flow positive. Sprint has to be a little creative in how they manage their balance sheet in the mid-term, but there is little question that their churn trajectory supports their long term plans. Of course, the market is not static; while AT&T (NYSE: T ) and Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) have been reluctant to dip prices to the same extent as Sprint and T-Mobile, anything will go if the cellular giants have a change of heart. Similarly, while T-Mobile has been aggressive against Sprint, there is always room for a more intense pricing war. As it is, if Sprint begins to have much success in mano-a-mano churn with T-Mobile (most churn success thus far has come at the expense of AT&T and Verizon) there is a reasonable likelihood that T-Mobile will respond with a renewed price slashing focus. Recent events with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) financing have raised question with regards to how the new offerings will impact cellular providers . Apple, for their part, is hopeful that the financing plans will keep consumers ever buying (with continual monthly payments) the newest phone models as they are released. And while the pricing war with cellular providers has been funded in part by shifting the old-school handset subsidy model to one in which consumers pay either upfront or monthly for their phones, it has allowed Apple room into the handset financing game: now that the subsidy model is dying, phone buyers no longer have a financial reason to not seriously look at getting their handsets directly from Apple. The question for investors relates to how the Apple plan will create a greater bucket of phone users who remain completely untethered to a particular phone plan: such consumers can simply move from month to month from one cellular provider to another with no associated penalty. Still, given the fact that cellular providers have begun a more routine policy of buying out the old plans of new customers, you must wonder how adverse the financial implications will be across the industry. In particular, the cost of gaining a new customer is larger than that of retaining an old customer. But if you remove the hundreds of dollars per customer of buyout options, the blow of adding new customers at increased advertising and retail sales costs begins quickly to be absorbed. And it seems apparent that value operations such as Sprint and T-Mobile will gain more in an unlocked environment than AT&T and Verizon: traditionally conservative customers for the cellular giants will be more likely to test the waters at Sprint and T-Mobile if they know that they will not be locked in, and can move back if they end up disliking what they find. Added to this, Sprint and T-Mobile offer slight discounts against Apple's financing plans (with handset insurance that covers loss and theft - Apple does not offer that service) while Verizon and AT&T are slightly more expensive. And while apples to apples comparisons are difficult based on a number of factors (i.e. how long you actually posses the phone before upgrading) the end result is that the Apple plan appears to be focused more on higher end consumers, which are the same consumers that typically fill out AT&T and Verizon: this should produce a greater percentage of untethered AT&T/Verizon customers than for Sprint or Verizon. Once again however, do not expect AT&T or Verizon to remain static on the issue if it results in particular losses for them. All of this adds up to a continuing shift in the cellular game-plan: prices are being unbundled in order to appeal to advertising techniques, with the lowest price gaining the most attention. Add-on pricing is simply a part of the game now. While the Apple move will create another shift in the overall market, it does not seem likely to result in serious financial harm to Sprint - on the contrary, Sprint may well benefit overall from the move: Son and Claure were already making moves to take the handset financing plans off of the balance sheet - Apple's plan should simplify that effort. Sprint value will continue the battle between positively trending churn and network performance rates, and cash flow uncertainty. Bull optimism on the carrier will wait out meaningful gains in free cash flow, yet even a minor shift in the metric with continued sharp increases in positive churn should lead to good investor returns. The newest Apple offering very well may be a boon to increased net adds for Sprint, while removing handset financing costs from the bottom line. The next couple of quarters will tell us much with regards to the continued prospects for a Sprint resurrection: the continued decrease in credit rating reflects the cash burn (as it ought to) but if the cash burn is being used effectively the end financial condition will improve. The lag between market value and improved business prospects is short, but continued attention to Sprint may well provide an opportunity for investors to benefit from the company turnaround, if it remains sustainable.
