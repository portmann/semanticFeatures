ETF Hub Jul  8 2015, 02:43 ET | About: Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) plans to announce a major new round of layoffs as early as today, as the company seeks to further cut costs amid a shifting technology landscape, NYT reports . The new cuts are in addition to the roughly 18,000 employees Microsoft said it planned to let go a year ago, and are expected to affect people in the company's hardware group. This is a major defeat for Windows 10 as it won't even appear on any phones. So much for seamless integrating a Win10 desktop PC with a Win10 phone. Instead of confronting Apple head-on on hardware, Microsoft and Google have to go to Plan B:  bombard everyone with free mobile productivity apps like Office and Google Docs, Gmail, etc. But such profitless offerings will never generate sufficient revenues to replace their dying, desktop-based cash cows of old like Windows and Google Search.
