Click to print (Opens in new window) Back in May, Amazon announced it was toying with the idea of creating its own house brand for everyday items like cereal and diapers. Not content to just stay in your cabinets, the e-commerce giant is apparently on the verge of infiltrating our closets with its own private-label fashion line.Â  The company would used the line to fill “gaps” in the marketplace, an Amazon executive said during the WWD Apparel and Retail CEO Summit on Monday, BuzzFeed New reports. Despite Amazon Fashion’s recent rise to the top of the retail ranks , it has often had difficulty attracting some big name, designer labels. “For Amazon, we know our customers love brands, many of the brands in this roomâ€¦and thatâ€™s where the lionâ€™s share of our business comes from,” Amazon Fashion’s vice president of clothing Jeff Yurcisin said. “When we see gaps â€” when certain brands have actually decided for their own reasons not to sell with us â€” our customer still wants a product like that.” In order to provide those things for customers, Yurcisin said the company could offer these products via a private label. The new label could also serve as a negotiating chip for brands that choose to forgo sales through Amazon. BuzzFeed reports that brands’ decision not to sell with Amazon often comes down to the e-tailer’s pricing strategy. On Monday, Yurcisin defended the company’s pricing model saying it was no different from other retailers. â€œWe work just like any other retailer â€” we buy at full price, try super-hard to sell at full-priceâ€¦then we follow a traditional markdown cadence,â€? he said.
