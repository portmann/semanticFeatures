Yahoo: Aabaco Spin-Off Is A Highly Unattractive Investment - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha Yahoo unveiled its plans to spin-off its 15% stake in Alibaba into Aabaco, an independent investment fund. Aabaco is an SPE de-facto for Alibaba shares that does not offer any additional benefit over investing directly in Alibaba. Investing in Aabaco for the sole purpose of profiting from a future acquisition that may never occur seems highly unattractive. The Internet giant, Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ), filed an N2 document with the SEC last week, unveiling its plans to spin off the rest of its stake in Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) into a newly traded investment fund named Aabaco Holdings. Yahoo holds approximately 15% of Alibaba's shares and prefers not to sell them on the open market to the public but to spin it off into a newly created investment fund. The fund's primary focus is to hold and invest in Alibaba's shares on the New York Stock Exchange, with at least 80% of the fund's assets held in Alibaba shares. The rest of Aabaco's assets will consist of the former Yahoo's Small Business that provided cloud-based services targeted at small businesses, including prepackaged options for web hosting, domain registration, e-commerce hosting services (including merchant billing and payment solutions), and other offerings. Aabaco expects that the value of Alibaba's shares will exceed 95% of the value of its total assets immediately after the spin-off is completed. This makes Aabaco a de facto special purpose enterprise (SPE) since its sole business is to own Alibaba's shares that were spun off from Yahoo. This makes Aabaco's stocks a separate class of Alibaba's shares or a derivative of BABA. Aabaco's stock price will be lower than Alibaba's price by default. Even if the number of shares Aabaco offers to the public is equal to the number of Alibaba shares it owns, the tiny operation of Aabaco Small Business (ASB) will burden the price and probably drive it down. In my opinion, Aabaco will offer more shares than the number of Alibaba's shares it owns and trade at a significant discount to Alibaba's share price to provide a cheaper alternative for investors interested in Alibaba. There is one problem with this idea. Alibaba is not Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A ) (NYSE: BRK.B ), and its stock price is only $83, which is tremendously lower than Berkshire's $216K unit price. In Berkshire's case, when every unit price is more than $216K, I can see the incentive to invest in such an SPE if it existed. However, in Alibaba's case, when the unit price is only $83, it seems redundant. The real reason behind the bizarre spin-off of Yahoo's $32B worth of Alibaba's shares is taxation. To avoid any tax liability, the Internet giant chose to pursue a tax-free spin-off mechanism in which the transfer of stock between two corporations has no tax liability. However, a simple transfer of Alibaba's shares to Aabaco does not meet the IRS spin-off requirements, so Yahoo decided to add its minuscule Small Business unit to give the transaction a legal status of a tax-free spin-off. As Aabaco offers a sole exposure to Alibaba, most investors will likely to be indifferent about holding BABA or Aabaco (symbol not revealed yet). The only incentive for buying Aabaco, that I can see, besides a lower stock price than BABA, is an expectation that Alibaba or a company that wants to purchase a large portion of the Chinese e-commerce giant will acquire Aabaco. Investing in an SPE with low add-value only for the possibility that it will be acquired sometime in the future seems highly unattractive, and investors should avoid this spin-off as it offers little (if any) additional value.
