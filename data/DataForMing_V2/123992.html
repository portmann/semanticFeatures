Microsoft guides light again; shares -4% - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Jul 21 2015, 19:38 ET | About: Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) guides on its FQ4 CC for its various reporting segments to collectively see FQ1 revenue of $20.7B-$21.3B, below a $22.8B consensus. The company has been guiding cautiously for several quarters. Forex is expected to have a 5% impact on FQ1 and FQ2 sales growth. Microsoft promises "Windows 10 momentum" will provide a lift during the second half of FY16 (ends June '16), and that Bing (responsible for major losses in past years) will turn profitable during the year. In the wake of the company's latest job cut announcement , FY16 operating expense guidance has been cut to $32.1B-$32.4B. The tax rate is expected to be at 24% (+/- 1%). Ahead of the job cuts and the related narrowing of Microsoft's phone efforts, phone revenue fell 38% Y/Y to $1.23B (feature phone decline), with a negative gross margin. Lumia units rose 10% to 8.4M, but Lumia revenue fell due to a lower ASP. Also: 1) Though revenue fell 5% Y/Y, the unearned revenue balance rose 1% Y/Y to $25.3B, and the contracted but not billed balance rose by ~$500M to $24.5B. 2) Office 365 consumer subs rose by nearly 3M Q/Q to 15.2M; traditional Office consumer revenue fell 42%. 3) Xbox shipments rose 30% to 1.4M. 4) Azure revenue and compute usage rose by triple digits Y/Y, and enterprise mobility management (EMM) software customers rose by nearly 90% to 17K+. 5) FQ4 capex totaled $1.7B. If you followed MSFT stock for 30 years, you would be aware that they are almost always conservative in their forward forecasting statements.
