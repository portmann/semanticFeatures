Amazon enters Britain's fresh food market - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Feb 29 2016, 04:11 ET | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) is stepping into the British fresh food market after striking a supply deal with supermarket Morrisons, ramping up competition in the already cut-throat sector. Britain's fourth largest supermarket said the deal would allow Amazon Prime Now and Amazon Pantry customers access to Morrisons ambient, fresh and frozen products in the coming months. Amazon previously launched a U.K. packaged groceries service in November, but it stopped short of replicating its broader U.S. Amazon Fresh service, which offers about 20K items from local shops.
