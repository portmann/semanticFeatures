Siminoff, who was previously the director of worldwide inclusion and diversity at Apple, replaces Janet Van Huysse. ( bit.ly/1Je2pAU ) Van Huysse, who has been with Twitter for six years, announced her departure on the social networking website on Tuesday. ( bit.ly/1NUff4 ) Van Huysse in an earlier post had outlined 2016 diversity goals for Twitter including boosting overall proportion of female employees to 35 percent and underrepresented minorities to 11 percent.
