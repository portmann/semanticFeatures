Ford And GM: Short-Term Overbought, But Longer-Term Still At Big Discount To Intrinsic Value - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ultimately, I think Ford Motor's intrinsic value is in low-to-mid $20's. GM's intrinsic value is approximately low-to-mid $50's. Both stocks are overbought into March '15 monthly auto sales due Wednesday, Thursday this week. Ford Motor (NYSE: F ) and General Motors (NYSE: GM ) were two underperformers in client accounts in 2014, despite the decent economy and GDP growth, and the collapse in crude oil in q4 '14, which you would think would stimulate demand for the bigger SUV's and trucks in the Ford and GM lineup. In calendar 2014, Ford was almost exactly flat on the year in terms of the capital appreciation of the stock, ending 12/31/13 at $15.43 and then closing on 12/31/14 at $15.50. Investors earned the dividend in 2014, or the approximate 3.5% dividend yield, underperforming the SP 500 dramatically, given its 13.50% return on the calendar year. GM was actually a little bit worse. After never owning the stock for client accounts all through the 1990's and 2000's, I bought the first position ever in GM in May, 2014, after listening to Mary Barra's Congressional testimony on the ignition switch scandal. I thought Barra was very clear and straight-forward in her testimony, and if she leads GM like that, I think she could have a dramatic impact on the company over the next 10 - 20 years in terms of a culture change at the automaker. GM closed on 12/31/13 at $40.87 and then closed at $34.91 on the close of trading on 12/31/14, declining 14% on the year excluding the dividend. More GM was purchased in the low $30's in q4 '14 and if the stock would pull back again, I'd buy more for client accounts. Here is the what I see is the bigger picture on Ford and GM, and why I still like the shares of both companies: 1) The 2008 Financial Crisis was a watershed moment for both Ford and GM as it allowed both companies to offload some of their healthcare costs into the VEBA trusts. 2) In addition, because financial leverage was such a root cause of what happened in 2008, the GMAC (now Ally Financial) and Ford Motor Credit ((OTCQB: FMCC )) are much more manageable and less risky entities, since the US banking and financial system is on a more sound footing, has less leverage, and is taking less risk. Ford Motor Credit is now the only auto finance division still owned by its parent, Ford Motor, as Ally Financial was spun-off, and Chrysler's finance arm was sold. 3)Seriously, when you think about both GM and Ford prior to 2008, and early 2009, you could make the case that given the post retirement healthcare liability burden (PRHC) and the size that the financing arms of each company grew to, pre-2008 Crisis, Ford and GM were really healthcare and banking institutions, with auto manufacturing businesses attached. Ford's stock price peaked in April, 1999 near $39 per share, and that was just prior to the Associates spin-off I think, so when you think about Ford and the size of Associates and then the size of Ford Motor Credit (back then), to classify Ford as a Consumer Discretionary or an Industrial, might be laughable. Ford was a giant financial masquerading as an auto manufacturer. But to bring us back to today, I do think you have two cleaner auto manufacturer operations, still with sizable defined benefit plans that are an ongoing drag financially, but both companies are producing better products, better cars actually, that Americans seem more interested in buying today, than in previous decades. Ford currently has a free-cash-flow yield of 10% while GM's is 5%. The big disparity is the debt-to-capital ratio: F's is 55%, GM's is 18%. Intrinsic value estimates: My internal estimates for Ford and GM are $24 - $25 for Ford and GM is $51 - $52 per share. Morningstar's discounted cash-flow model which takes a longer view of the business cycle and competitive position, values Ford at $22 and GM at $50 respectively. Roughly speaking, at current prices that puts Ford at a 30% discount to intrinsic value and GM at a 25% discount to intrinsic value. If you look at the respective earnings growth rates for 2015 for both companies, this year is expected to be a strong year, and after the stock under-performed dramatically in 2014, I am expecting both stocks to make up the underperformance in the next 12 - 18 months. Summary / conclusion: I do think both auto OEM's are making better products at a better margin and moving away from the disastrous culture of the 1980's, and 1990's. Both these companies excelled at making truly crap products, and I think that is in the process of changing for the better. For both companies, managing the defined benefit plan is still an influence on the financials, but both companies can continue to boost the dividend and buy back stock, with GM in my opinion, having a little more room to return capital. Rising interest rates and a rising stock market have a positive influence on the pension plan from a shareholder perspective. Which stock would I buy first ? Today, I think Ford is the bigger discount to intrinsic or fair value, and more will be bought closer to $15, but GM and Mary Barra have the opportunity to generationally transform GM from a monolithic bureaucracy to a 21st century auto company. More GM would be bought closer to $34. March '15 auto sales are due out Wednesday or Thursday this week, so we'll be watching the F-150 sales to see if the new model continues to get traction. Ford will be lapping the Venezuela devaluation in q1 '15. However South America could continue to be a drag for both companies in 1 '15. What surprised me about recent Consumer Reports surveys was how well Buick was doing, in customer satisfaction surveys. Personally I've never owned an American car, and my current model has 70,000 miles. I would seriously look at an American car the next time one needs to be bought.
