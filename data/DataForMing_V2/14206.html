ETF Hub FB's valuation has grown to nearly $240 billion, but it might still present a good investment opportunity. The reason lies in its ARPU, and its disconnect from GOOG. New services like video and payments could add an extra $1 each to ARPU, and FB will continue to gain from ad pricing growth. There's a common thought among many retail value investors that Facebook's (NASDAQ: FB ) valuation of nearly $240 billion is leaving very little room for upside, and that investors are buying into a value trap. While I admit a $240 billion valuation based on today's fundamentals is certainly a stretch, investors need to remember one key thing when determining if Facebook is a good investment. That thing is that Facebook is in fact an advertising company and with 1.4 billion monthly active users (MAUs) - and 1.2 billion MAUs on mobile - Facebook has a great opportunity to grow significantly larger through more effective monetization of those users. That said, Facebook is unveiling and launching new revenue-creating services so fast that it is difficult to keep up. But rather than trying to determine how much revenue and profits Facebook can earn from each of these new services, investors are likely best served by looking solely at average revenue per user (ARPU) to see how much upside Facebook does in fact have. First off, Facebook does have the largest network in the world. If we account for its network on non-Facebook applications (Messenger, WhatsApp, Instagram) then that network is even larger. While the ARPU chart, courtesy of Digital Strategy Consulting , shows how Facebook compares to Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) as of Q1 2014, the point is to illustrate that Facebook still has a lot of runway to monetize itself. As of Facebook's most recent quarter, ARPU in North America had risen to $9 while overall ARPU increased from $2.14 to $2.81 year-over-year. Therefore, Facebook is seeing significant growth in ARPU, and what's impressive is that most of this growth in recent years has come mainly from growing its total advertiser base from one million to two million and more efficiently monetizing mobile. In essence, these things have taken Facebook's North American ARPU from $5.15 in Q4 2012 to $9 in its most recent quarter. Looking ahead, Facebook will continue to monetize its growing network of advertisers. While the 173% average ad pricing growth it saw last year may slow a bit, Facebook has given us no reason to believe that ad prices won't continue to increase. Yet aside from advertiser count and ad prices, what's really exciting for Facebook investors moving into the next 12 months is both video and payments. Specifically, Facebook just recently added a user-to-user payment option to its Messenger app, a feature that can be used by the app's sub-700 million users. Initially Facebook does not appear to be charging users to send or receive money, a move that many investors have criticized. However, investors must remember that Facebook is notorious for getting users to adopt a service on a large scale before monetizing it. Facebook did this with Instagram and also its core site; in the early years Facebook was criticized for not monetizing its platform with ads. All things being equal, investors should just assume that Facebook's goal is to attract widespread use of its payments service, and then to begin monetizing with PayPal-like services and fees, such as currency exchange money services with WhatsApp. Theoretically, if Facebook earns $1 annually in future fees per WhatsApp/Messenger user through payments, it'll have a $1.4 billion business, and consequently adding another $1 of ARPU globally. That said, I expect payments to be much bigger: if PayPal can generate $2.2 billion in revenue during its last quarter on just 162 million users, then I find it hard to believe that Facebook can't eventually generate at least a billion dollars quarterly with a combined 1.4 billion WhatsApp and Messenger users, assuming WhatsApp becomes a part of payments. As for videos, Facebook has quickly grown into a powerhouse in the online video space with three billion daily views of video content. However, like so many other new Facebook ventures, the company is still in the early stages of monetization. While Facebook is sure to monetize this content in many ways, one of the more popular methods discussed is by selling 15 second spots to advertisers. These spots would give advertisers a 24-hour window where their 15 second video ads would be shown to Facebook users across all platforms. Reportedly, Facebook is charging up to $2 million a day for these slots, but what's unknown is how many slots per day that Facebook is selling. What we do know is that Facebook has launched video advertising services in eight total markets , including the U.S., and Sheryl Sandberg sees it as a key initiative moving forward. In theory, Facebook could sell a dozen daily ad spots, or more, but even if it sells just two per day at $2 million each, that's an extra $1.4 billion in revenue. Thus, there's yet another $1 add to Facebook's global ARPU. The point is that because of Facebook's enormous user base, the opportunities for monetization are vast. Conservative payment and video monetization outlooks could very well add over $2 to Facebook's $9 North American ARPU, and double the ARPU in many of its emerging markets. Importantly, this doesn't even account for the new services that Facebook will unveil in the future, or continued MAU and ad price growth. While Facebook may never top $50 in ARPU like Google, I certainly think $25 is feasible long term, nearly triple its North American ARPU and an increase of 10-fold to many other markets. Admittedly, this is speculative, but given the separation that exists between Facebook and Google, I tend to believe it is far more likely that Facebook will create more efficient methods of monetizing its 1.4 billion users versus having its ARPU growth come to a sudden halt. Therefore, Facebook may look expensive now, but for a company that's expected to grow annual revenue from $12.5 billion to $22.6 billion over the next two years, and trades at 60x trailing 12-month free cash flow, I think Facebook is still a good long-term investment opportunity.
