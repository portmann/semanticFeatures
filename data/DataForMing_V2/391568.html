Is It Safe To Buy QQQ Again? - PowerShares QQQ Trust ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ) | Seeking Alpha With Facebook and Amazon still to report, we feel it may be too soon to buy the QQQ ETF. We are not convinced that Facebook and Amazon will beat analyst expectations. The Fed could potentially drive the QQQ lower if it is hawkish at the FOMC meeting and causes the U.S. dollar to strengthen. We believe sitting out until all companies have reported and the Fedâ€™s decision/statement has been absorbed by the market. As some readers will be aware we have been in and out of owning the Nasdaq 100 ETF (NASDAQ: QQQ ) in the last couple of months. We bought in when we felt things were looking incredibly undervalued, and were very fortunate to see a fantastic return of 14 percent. This return was far more than even the inner-bull was dreaming of, and thus we decided to lock in those gains ahead of earnings season because we were not sure the key players were going to deliver on expectations. Timing isn't always our strong suit, but we certainly did quite well with these. Since we closed our QQQ position it has dropped by 3 percent, as you can see below. With only the usually reliable Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) left to report from the big five companies within the index, we have been tossing up between opening a position or not once the market opens today. But we have decided against it because we are not as confident with Facebook and Amazon's results as we once were. Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) results were a bit of an eye-opener in our opinion. At this stage we believe it is hard to say whether Facebook has stolen market share away from Google, or whether demand is softer overall. We do fear that a negative result from Facebook could result in the index being sold down further as sentiment depletes even more. It has been well-documented that sharing on Facebook has been on the decline , perhaps thanks in part to the rise of Snapchat (Private: CHAT ). As Snapchat users we can certainly vouch for how it has dramatically changed our use of social media. Snapchat is usually the first thing we check in the morning and gone are the days of checking in somewhere, we'll just use our Snap story instead for that. Thankfully posting an image on Instagram still appears to be a popular way of alternatively checking in somewhere. So at least Facebook is winning there. Now don't get us wrong, we are not at all questioning the viability of Facebook. For us it is a model company with an outstanding leader and one that we feel sure has high levels of innovation which will see it grow for many years to come. We just feel this quarter its earnings may not live up to the high expectations the market currently has for it, through no fault of its own. That's the problem when you're such a fantastic company, the market keeps expecting you to smash their expectations. Amazon is another example of a fantastic company with an outstanding leader. U.S. retail sales have been incredibly underwhelming this year. This has us a little concerned that the retail side of the business may have underperformed expectations. Though we see little reason why the rest of the business wouldn't be continuing its excellent growth. We expect the company will match earnings expectations this quarter. This leads us on to the Federal Reserve. The Fed will decide on interest rates later today and although it is widely expected to keep rates on hold , it will be what Yellen says that could shape the market's performance. If Yellen uses hawkish rhetoric, possibly hinting at a rate rise in May or, most probably, June, then there could be a touch of panic returning to the markets. With the index already facing declines, this could compound things further leading to more declines. We agree with some market observers who are saying that a hawkish Fed could result in the strengthening of the U.S. dollar (NYSEARCA: UUP ). This seems like a natural reaction in the FX markets, as the U.S. dollar starts to become an attractive safe haven once again. The ramifications on a strong dollar divides opinion. Whilst a strong dollar is a sign of an improved economy, it is also rather troublesome for many companies as it undoes a lot of the benefits to corporate earnings that a weaker dollar has been providing. This could potentially cause a broad market sell-off dragging the Nasdaq 100 down further again. Whilst this is not a certainty, if you imagine the U.S. dollar index back over $1.00 again, it certainly will not make life easy for companies like Google when it comes to reporting in the next few quarters. So for this reason, despite the decline in the QQQ we feel it is too soon to open a long position again. Once Facebook and Amazon have reported and the Fed's comments have sunk in, then it might be time to reassess and look to see if there is an opportunity for an investment. An alternative to the QQQ could be the UUP, which we see strengthening quite a bit over the next few months if the Fed is indeed hawkish later today. Best of luck with your investments, we'll report back with any changes to our plans as and when they occur.
