Apple: Share Buybacks Are A Problem, Not A Solution - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Share buybacks are increasingly used but they are a questionable management tool. Apple has a lot of spare cash flow and has decided to spend a good chunk of it with buybacks. Only an extremely low share price gives safety margin to pursue a buyback. Generally speaking, companies are still striving to achieve past growth levels after the 2007-2008 Great Recession. At the same time, it is amazing to note that an increasing number of large companies use a smart scheme - share buyback - to boost earnings per share. While firms may also buy back their own shares to try to push up the price - among other reasons - these operations should be an exception, not a rule. Having started in 2012, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has one of the largest share repurchase programs in corporate history. The company increased again its stock buybacks, expecting to spend $175 billion by the end of March 2018. As of March 26, 2016, Apple had already utilized $117 billion. Dividends used to be the main way to give back cash to shareholders. Not anymore. Stock buybacks are growing fast enough to become a real interrogation mark within blue-chip companies. It's a kind of addiction because, in a simple way, it tries to achieve management goals - but not growth or value - outside normal business activity. When a company pursues a buyback it is investing in itself and the firm's management surely thinks that there is no better business than that. All this is very misleading - notably in Apple's case - by the following reasons: 1. While spending billions of dollars with the sole purpose to reduce the number of shares of the company its price has been going down over the last 15 months. 2. With the share buyback Apple has aimed to improve earnings per share which is not happening. 3. Even for Apple, hoping that its shares will climb due to buybacks is wrong. The company has a large floating stock and only the law of supply and demand will drive its price evolution. 4. Any rise through a buyback effect will represent a short-term play without consistency. 5. According to the rationale of share buybacks, Apple investors sell shares at a price low enough to make them attractive for purchase by Apple. 6. When a company repurchases shares to prevent or reverse undervaluation the advice to the market is that trading players for some reason are not supporting the supposed potential of the company. In order to clarify some topics, the following table shows that even after a relevant buyback the decrease in Apple's earnings per share remained equally significant. In fact, EPS decreased 18.5% while net income fell 22.5%. However, it can be noted that this slight improvement is misleading. In fact, with such a small difference our attention must focus on the repurchase price of Apple shares and the future profits of the company. If the stock prices fall or stay weak in the future and profits fail to be adequate the share repurchase may be a bad deal and lead to an increased risk for the company. Without a large margin of safety (which will be addressed below) there's a high probability that the buyback ROI will be poor or even negative. All this is harmful to long-term investors. On the other hand, share prices cannot be prevented from following their normal course through supply and demand. Share buybacks will not be able to increase significantly the share price, especially in the case of Apple which has a very large floating stock. The chart above is enlightening: from early 2015 until March 26, 2016, while Apple has repurchased shares in the amount of around $58 billion its price has declined most of the time. Additionally, from the data disclosed, the average price was ~$114 for the same period. It should be noted that the overall average repurchase price - since the program's inception in 2012 - was ~$92, which is a rather inadequate result. Under normal conditions, the only reason that should force a company to buy its own shares would be when its market price is exceedingly below its intrinsic value. And even then it would be an exceptional procedure. For long-term investors, raising earnings per share due to a share buyback doesn't increase fundamental value. In fact, Apple's assessment necessarily takes into account the reductions in both cash and shares. I believe that Apple will awake sooner or later for an aggressive performance in the marketplace. However, it is only my belief because currently facts don't confirm this hope. Share prices always reflect a company's situation and its strengths in the light of customers and competitors. Thus, it is not the share repurchase that will increase the value of the company. Long-term investors will not welcome a weak or negative buyback ROI instead of alternative investments that have to do with the core business of the company and its sustained growth. Although Apple's management has the utmost confidence in the future of the company and also in the value of its shares, an investment of such magnitude on share repurchases is not only a great risk but may also be a bad deal. This can be explained succinctly. First, over a period of 15 months Apple shares have been in a medium-term downward trend even with the help of a large portion of the share buyback program. Secondly, with a huge investment of this type, the company may get a low or negative buyback ROI and unfavorable consequences in the long run. Indeed, if Apple share price remains weak or even goes down, Apple will spend more money to buy back shares than its long-term value. It is a great risk that is only possibly eliminated if the repurchase price is dramatically lower than the intrinsic value of the company. Only then there would be the required safety margin. In any case, it will always be a tricky way of trying to increase earnings per share. Instead, effective management measures should be used to the launch of outstanding innovative products and investment in new generation businesses. - The Value of Share Buybacks by Magnus Erik Hvass Pedersen - Profits Without Prosperity by William Lazonick (Harvard Business Review) - The Repurchase Revolution (The Economist) Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.
