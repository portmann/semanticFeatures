Report: iPhone 7 will go on sale September 16 - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Jul 24 2016, 07:34 ET | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor According to prominent mobile phone leaker Evan Blass (a.k.a @evleaks), the world may be just under two months away from the iPhone 7. "iPhone 2016 release: week of September 12th," he wrote on Twitter. "Just to clarify, this refers to the retail release, not the launch event. To be even more specific, it should happen on Friday, Sept. 16th." Rumors are also swirling about whether Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) will offer a three model line-up for the first time, including a so-called iPhone 7 Pro. Now let's see if my prediction made a year ago (summer 2015) that AAPL would bottom in the stretch of the 2016 spring holds... Aside from the IPHO7 which no matter what you all bashers/haters think WILL BE A BIG SUCCESS (rich people have never been so many in the world and rich people buy APPLE so fear not - there are plenty of wallets ready to open come the fall), the WATCH 2 should debut as well a long overdue revolutionary line of MACBOOKPROs that will just reignite growth. Add to that all the services booming and a much bigger slice of the cloud business... all will be fine for AAPL longs. One of the major issues Apple has as a headwind is that cellular companies no longer offer the $199 phone with a 2 yr commitment. That was a huge advantage on a $600-$700 phone. Everyone could find $200.  Not everyone wants to make $30/month payments for 24-30 months.  But, with that being said, people aren't going to go without a phone so that headwind will only last so long. They will find the money or find a different phone to get.  We have become so reliant on our cell phones!  Cell phones makers and cellular companies have become much like a utility. People will go without a lot of stuff before giving up such a big communication device.  For instance 2 weeks ago while on vacation my phone accidentally went swimming...  I felt naked without my phone.  When I arrived back home I bought a refurbished 5s so it can get me through until the iPhone 8 comes out next year.  I'm long Apple I have to disagree with you. I think more people are going to be willing to put the phone on payments then we're willing to pay the money up front. Especially once the consumer understands that they were still paying for the phone over time with a two year contract. Actually often times they were paying quite a bit more. If the absence of a two year contract is a headwind for anybody, it is they cellular companies because now they make almost no money on the devices. I can't wait, and someone in my family also expects to get soon my 6S. I am happy to use new features, enjoy the consistency of aggregate innovation, including faster processors, brighter screen, new home button, and no earphone connector. I know we will hear so many voices trashing the phone, telling how little change it has, how Apple lost its touch, and many will find something to criticize. That is the nature of Apple products. Unfortunately, many of critics have never used or even see first hand the Apple product they criticize. Well said, jpin. I'm waiting for the string of negative comments below from people that never used an Apple product. For example, a well known korean manufacturer, alongside its discounts on 2016 models (1+1 free...), heavily discounts the previous year model (60% off)... My 4S (i have to say i am ashamed as i own a 4S while i could buy so many 6sPLUS but that is how i was taught about spending money -...) could still be sold around 100USD.... i guess an S3 would not even sell as they are all obsolete/dead by now. Apple fanboys seem to forget how product life cycles work. Their beloved company was once nearly in the grave for failing to recognize this fact. iPhone won't last forever, so they better get something new out soon that can replace it...going to need to replace A LOT or revenue at some point.  Over-confidence is a sure killer... PS : would people call WARREN BUFFET a KO or IBM fanboy as he owns shares of those companies for so long ? Well call me whatever you want. It makes me rich. Are you sure this isn't the announcement date as opposed to the sale date? They usually start selling in October don't they? A month after launch event? The device will go on sale (i.e. can be ordered) on Sept. 16. The unknown is the wait time until the customer receives the device. i think that the device will be introcuded on tuesday 6th of september, preorder on the 9th and in the hands of customers on the 16th. I am very good at predictions. I predicted 3 weeks before it happened (i said it will happen soon - check my history) that BUFFET would invest in AAPL. Do we know if Apple was able to pull off the new color?    Or is the only differentiator going to be the headphone removal?
