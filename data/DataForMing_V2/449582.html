Matt Graves, whose son Lane was killed in the Seven Seas Lagoon at Walt Disney World's Grand Floridian Resort & Spa after being dragged off in shallow waters, gave details about the attack to a fire captain, the Orlando Sentinel reported on Sunday. The disclosure came via email messages obtained by the newspaper from the Reedy Creek Fire Department, in which Captain Tom Wellons relayed the father's account from the day after the incident to his supervisors, the newspaper reported. Graves was en route to a hospital for treatment on injuries he sustained while trying to save his son when he shared "the horror that he experienced" as his son was being pulled into the water and "how another gator attacked him as he fought," Wellons wrote in the email, according to the report.
