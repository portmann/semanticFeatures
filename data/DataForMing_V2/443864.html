A California woman tells the Seattle Times that a few days after Windows 10 launched, her computer started trying to download and install the upgrade, despite the fact that she hadnâ€™t authorized it do so. The result? Her computer, which she uses to run a travel-agency business, started acting up, crashing, running super slowly, and becoming unusable for days at a time. â€œI had never heard of Windows 10,â€? she told the Seattle Times. â€œNobody ever asked me if I wanted to update.â€? She tried to reach out to the company, and when that failed, she took Microsoft to court in an attempt to get compensation for lost wages, and to cover the costs of a new computer. She won an initial judgment, which Microsoft appealed. The company then decided to drop its appeal last month â€”without admitting any wrongdoing â€” and agreed to pay her $10,000. She’s far from alone in her anti-Windows 10 angst: ever since Microsoft launched Windows 10, users have complained over the companyâ€™s various tactics to get people to upgrade. Stories of computers installing the software unbidden , or confusing prompts that led users to upgrade when they thought they were saying no to the update have stacked up this year. It’s all leading up to July 29, which marks the last day that Windows 10 will be a free upgrade for existing Windows users (itâ€™ll be $119 to upgrade after that point), and itâ€™s also the last time anyone will see an annoying pop-up notification encouraging them to â€œGet Windows 10.â€?
