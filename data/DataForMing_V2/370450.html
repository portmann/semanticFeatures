UBS: Verizon's Go90 mobile video off to 'slow start' - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha Mar  9 2016, 15:34 ET | About: Verizon Communications (VZ) | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor A UBS report notes that Verizon's (NYSE: VZ ) mobile video service Go90 is " off to a slow start ," based on a look at Apple app store downloads. Its best showing, UBS says, was "around No. 300 when ranked against all apps in the iTunes store and No. 20 when ranked against other entertainment apps." While it's usually linked with other video services like Sling TV, it's also competing with other millennial-friendly attention-grabbing apps, the firm says. Verizon hasn't disclosed any subscriber data, but the service isn't expected to be profitable for a few years. It launched in September. “We believe Go90 will be hard-pressed to mount a meaningful challenge to mobile video and social networking leaders YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Netflix and Hulu,” writes analyst John Hodulik. “That said, Verizon is pulling various levers to ramp up interest in and usage of Go90, including more live and exclusive content and free data for Verizon Wireless customers.” Previously: Verizon, Hearst solidify millennial video efforts with joint venture (Mar. 02 2016) ETF Screener: Search and filter by asset class, strategy, theme, performance, yield, and much more ETF Performance: View ETF performance across key asset classes and investing themes
