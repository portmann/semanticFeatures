Spherical Samsung Gear S2 Can Still Challenge The Apple Watch - Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) | Seeking Alpha Samsung has lost its crown to Apple as the worldâ€™s biggest vendor of smartwatches. The new spherical Gear S2 smart watch might help Samsung improve its position against the Apple Watch. Before Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) released its watch last April , Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) was the runaway leader in smartwatch sales. Samsung sold 1.2 million units of its Gear watches in 2014 - almost double that of second-ranked Pebble (700,000 units). Samsung also had quarterly sales of 600,000 units of its Gear products for the first two quarters of this year. However, this accomplishment is now overshadowed by newcomer Apple. Statista's chart below reveals the Apple Watch sold 3.6 million units during the April-June quarter. Apple is now the No.2 player in sales of wearables, just behind Fitbit (NYSE: FIT ). I now opine that Samsung's Tizen-powered Gear S2 is its best hope of maintaining its 600k/quarter performance for the second half. The round-face design of the Gear S2 might help it compete better against Apple's watch. The iPhone company has not yet released a spherical version of its best-selling watch. Samsung was likely inspired by Motorola's Moto 360 watch and the LG Watch Urbane . Traditional form factors do apply sometime even to smartwatches. Samsung's decision to also use round UI icons gives the Gear S2 an Apple Watch-like vibe. Getting inspiration from Apple's watch is still fair game for Samsung. The evolution of Samsung's smartwatch design is illustrated below. The need to differentiate is strong because aside from Apple, Samsung is now also competing with other firms . Fitbit has started selling its own smartwatch product this year. Garmin (NASDAQ: GRMN ) also sells its own smartwatch . Xiaomi only sells the $15 Mi Band but it might also release a full-pledged smartwatch before 2015 is over. In spite of the rising competition, I have great faith in Samsung's multibillion annual marketing budget. The four major U.S. carriers will also be backing the Gear S2. Samsung can maintain or even improve its 600k/quarter sales when major carriers around the world also support the new Gear S2. The three variants of the Gear S2 can appeal to different type of buyers. The Gear S2 Classic will charm people who still like their smart timekeeper to look like traditional wristwatches. The Gear S2 3G will appeal to nerds who want their smartwatches to make phone calls like Dick Tracy. The IP68 certification also allows the Gear S2 to be used for long duration under wet or dusty conditions. The Apple Watch has a an IPX7 rating- meaning it can survive getting submerged in 1 meter deep water for 30 minutes. However, the Apple Watch has not been rated if it is protected from dust ingress. The smartwatch product category is important for Samsung and other smartphone vendors. The prevalent cutthroat pricing strategy of Android smartphones OEMs has contributed greatly to Samsung's misfortune. Samsung desperately needs new products to offset the rising competition on tablets and smartphones. As long as Apple doesn't release its own circular face watch, the Gear S2 will find many willing buyers. The Gear S2 is not a small fry venture anymore. Statista predicted that 26.1 smartwatches (excluding smartbands) will be sold this year. A Tizen watch that sells 3 million units/year at an average selling price of $200 gives Samsung an extra non-phone related $600 million. Samsung also has the muscle to invade Fitbit's core fitness & health tracking wristbands by coming up with sub-$100 smart bands. The $50 Fitbit Zip and Jawbone UP2 are still way cheaper than the $100 Gear Fit . Low-cost basic fitness/health monitor bands are worthy of Samsung's attention. Gfk reported that 13.5 million health & fitness trackers were sold in 2014 and 25 million units will be sold this year. If Samsung comes up with a $50 Gear Fit and sell 3 million units of them, that's another $150 million/year of non-phone related sales. According to IDC's Q1 2015 forecast wristwear devices (including fitness trackers/watches) will comprise most of the 72.1 million wearables that will be sold this year. This trend will continue until 2019. It will be a shame if Samsung lets Fitbit or Xiaomi continue to dominate the fitness & health tracker industry. There is still decent money to be made in selling sub-$100 wristwear devices. FitBit reported Q2 revenue of $400 million on sales of 4.5 million fitness trackers. FIT's stock price has dropped big time since its IPO last June. However, it still outperformed SSNLF and AAPL. Samsung ought to adjust to the current reality that many investors believe affordable fitness trackers are on an upswing trend .
