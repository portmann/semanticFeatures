Apple 2016 Outlook: The Sun Can't Shine Everyday - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Jan.  2, 2016  1:23 PM ET  |  About: Apple Inc. (AAPL) , Includes: FB , GOOG , GOOGL , LNVGY , PYPL , T , ZTCOY by: WestEnd511 Tough iPhone comps and competitive risk to limit iPhone adoption. Shift in carrier distribution will further weigh on shipments. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) finished 2015 on a painful note with the stock down -7.7% vs. +4% of the Nasdaq Composite as new iPhone shipments continue to decelerate and non-iPhone products severely disappointed the market due to lack of broad adoption. 2015 performance is a clear reversal from the +40% return in 2014 and it appears as though my bear thesis on AAPL is gradually playing out (see: Apple: The Party Is Over; Initiating With A Bearish View ). Investors will no doubt continue to look for positive catalysts in 2016, but I suspect they will likely be disappointed again as the reality of decelerating iPhone sales, tough iPhone comps and the eroding ecosystem catch on with investors. At the end of the day, AAPL generates more than half of its sales from a single product that is highly commoditized and faces higher comps (and consumer expectations) year after year. Additionally, the gradual acceptance of Android (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) by the mainstream consumers and the overall improvement of the Android OS are key risks to AAPL's ecosystem (see - Apple: The Challenged Ecosystem ). First, non-iPhone products and services will continue to see structural challenges that prevent broad adoption. I note that Apple Watch sales continue to be immaterial, while Apple Pay has yet to drive adoption to a degree many previously expected. With rival Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), Google and smaller fintech payment peers, such as PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL ), quick to act on the mobile payment front, Apple Pay is unlikely to gain an edge over its rivals as the iPhone once did back in 2007. Second, the changes in the smartphone distribution model in North America as carriers shift to equipment installment plans will push out the handset upgrade cycle, presenting another challenge for iPhone adoption. Although AAPL has rolled out its own smartphone leasing plans, it is difficult to see how it can stimulate demand as consumers are looking to lower their wireless bill after the two-year handset payment period. In the light of the risks to AAPL's hardware and ecosystem, I would underweight AAPL in 2016 and stick with smartphone makers that are gaining share globally, namely ZTE Corp ( OTCPK:ZTCOY ) and Lenovo ( OTCPK:LNVGY ). As for ecosystem plays, my preferred pick remains GOOG given the diversified revenue stream and attractive call options in robotics, home automation and other moonshot projects. Given that Apple Watch has failed to gain mainstream traction, Apple Pay is less disruptive than many had anticipated, Apple Music lacks material differentiation and Apple TV fails to take as AAPL capitulates to the content owners, many investors wonder what AAPL's next game-changing product will be. In short, I continue to see new product challenges for AAPL in 2016, which places greater pressure on the company to monetize its non-iPhone products such as payments, the App Store and other digital services. On payments, AAPL is slowly losing its edge over other upcoming payment products from internet companies, such as FB, which is already rolling out P2P payment services via its mobile messenger. Overtime, I believe that FB Messenger could follow its Asian rivals such as WeChat and LINE to incorporate merchant payment services that allow users to pay for restaurants, auto repair, and other local services, judging by FB's recent integration of local services into its mobile messenger. The key message here is that the North American payment market has multiple contenders such as GOOG, Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ), PayPal ( PYPL ) and Square (NYSE: SQ ), to set a mobile payment standard whereas in Asia the market is more mature and gravitates toward a handful of players (i.e., Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) and Tencent ( OTCPK:TCEHY ) in China). Given that AAPL has yet to gain a material first-mover advantage over Android Pay or Samsung Pay, the market is wide open for AAPL's rivals to take additional share, which is ultimately a negative to AAPL's ecosystem. Just last week, AT&T (NYSE: T ) became the latest carrier to shift from two-year contracts to an equipment installment plan. Now all four major US carriers are encouraging EIP. I consider this to be a fundamental headwind for iPhone adoption as it pushes out the smartphone upgrade cycle beyond two years when customers will be qualified for a discount on their monthly bills after they pay off their device. It's worth reminding investors that under the EIP model, a majority of the subs put off an upgrade because there is significant savings (i.e., monthly payment for the device) at the end of the two-year cycle. Given that the premium and mid-end smartphones are becoming increasingly reliable, subs are pushing out the replacement rate of their devices over time and this will significantly impact AAPL's replacement cycle in 2016 with increasing magnitude becoming evident in early 2017. Additionally, there is growing evidence of the enlarging used smartphone market where consumers purchase refurbished iPhones over the latest model. While the bulls may argue that this is a positive as it highlights the attractiveness of the iPhone ecosystem, I would argue that the growing demand for refurbished iPhones would ultimately impact the demand profile of new iPhones. For the skeptics, we can just simply take a look at the y/y smartphone activation rate that is taking a turn in recent quarters, a clear sign of lengthening upgrade cycle and this is a negative to the iPhone adoption. AAPL is facing a shrinking ecosystem as handset shipments decline, and I believe one solution is to unbundle its services by allowing them to be available on multiple platforms. AAPL Music's availability to Android users in China is a clear example of how AAPL is trying to expand its addressable user base when faced with a maturing handset market. It makes sense for AAPL to unbundle its services from the hardware to drive higher penetration of its ecosystem and increase its non-iPhone revenues. Mass commercialization of Apple Pay will be particularly necessary given that AAPL is on equal footing with Android and Samsung Pay in mobile payments in North America, similar to that of the competitive dynamic AAPL is facing in China where it is competing against Tencent and BABA. That said, it is necessary for AAPL to introduce an Apple Pay app for Android to drive payment penetration in non-iPhone devices. The integration of merchant services such as movie/entertainment, food delivery, travel booking and so forth is a logical step given how FB recently embedded local services with ecommerce functions in its mobile app. Failing to scale up its services will likely make AAPL lose out against FB in mobile payments. Looking at other AAPL services, I can argue that Music, iTunes, iBooks and Apple TV lack material differentiation against those offered by rivals so it does not make much sense to isolate its services only on the iOS platform. Ultimately, I see Apple unbundling other services such as iTunes, Movies and Apple Pay to drive adoption of its services. I note that AAPL's decision to make iTunes mainstream planted the seed for the adoption of its ecosystem well before the launch of the first iPhone. The mass commercialization of Apple Music is the second catalyst for this trend, and we can certainly see the unbundling trend to flow to iBooks, Movies and Apple Pay. 2016 could potentially be a rocky year for AAPL investors in light of risks on higher iPhone comps, poor traction in non-iPhone products and decelerating iPhone demand due to the shift in carrier distribution models. I remain cautious on AAPL stock and prefer FB and GOOG as my top tech picks for 2016 (see - Facebook: 2016 Outlook - Messenger And Virtual Reality The Key Catalysts and Google 2016 Outlook: The Changing Face Of TV As We Know It ).
