Disney: A Fairy Tale Growth Story - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Disney has provided exceptional investment returns over the past decade. However, the way in which these returns were generated may not be intuitively obvious. Everyone knows Disney (NYSE: DIS ). Whether it's the Disney movies (including Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm), the toys, ESPN, ABC, Disneyland and Disney World (not to mention the international parks and vacation club properties) or the cruise lines you probably have a reasonable idea of what the business does. As the company puts it : "(Disney) is a leading diversified international family entertainment and media enterprise with five business segments: media networks, parks and resorts, studio entertainment, consumer products and interactive media." Incidentally, the order of these segments is no mistake. Last year Disney had revenues of about $49 billion . Here's a look at how that revenue was divided among the company's segments: So Disney is by and large a media network and park / resort company, with the added bonus of creating blockbuster and adored movies and products on the side. From that $49 billion in sales, Disney was able to generate an operating profit (before shared expenses and taxes) of about $13 billion. Here's a look at how that operating income was divided among the various segments: This set of data points continues to tell the story. Once more you have media networks and parks / resorts dominating the operating income segment. This makes sense. If most of your revenues are derived from these two segments it seems like a reasonable expectation that your income would be largely attributable to these divisions as well. However, the amount allocated can be instructive. Disney had operating earnings of about $13 billion on sales of $49 billion last year, or an operating profit margin of roughly 27%. In viewing the amount of profit and revenues made up by each division, you can tell whether each segment was above or below the company's total operating profit margin. For instance, media networks contributed 43% of the revenue but 56% of the operating profit. As a result you know that this segment had an operating profit margin above 27%. Indeed, this leading segment had margins of nearly 35% last year. On the other hand, you also know that the parks and resorts segment had an operating profit margin below 27% as its portion of the income was less than its revenues. Indeed, this segment had margins of "just" 18%. In working through a company with data points, you can begin to tell the story. It takes you from an abstract view of a Mickey Mouse toy to the tangible bones of the business. You might think of Disney Princesses or theme parks when you hear the company's name, but by profit Disney is very much a cable network. Once you start developing a story, you can see how the numbers interact. It's easy to look at a stock chart and think you have some insight. For Disney, at least over the last few years, it looks like a middle school math problem: a linear path upward. Yet it's important to understand where this growth is derived. At the end of fiscal year 2005 (ending the Saturday closest to September 30th) Disney reported revenues of nearly $32 billion. That's a sizable number. That averages out to nearly $5 spent on Disney products and services for every person in the world. From this $32 million in sales, Disney was able to make a profit of about $2.7 billion. This equates to net profit margin of roughly 8.5%. By the end of fiscal year 2014, as described above, Disney had revenues of nearly $49 billion. This too is a large number. The average Disney expenditure per worldwide person went up to almost $7. Perhaps more pertinently, this represents an annual average compound growth rate of about 4.8%. Now this does demonstrate reasonable growth (the company showed higher sales in every year but one) but it's nothing to text home about. It's certainly not the explosive sales growth demonstrated by say Chipotle (NYSE: CMG ) or Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) during the same time period. To give you some reference, over the same time period Coca-Coca (NYSE: KO ) was able to grow revenues by 8% per year. Even Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ), which by 2005 was already selling $316 billion worth of stuff, was able to grow revenues by 4.9% per annum during the same time period. In other words, Disney's revenue growth hasn't been especially impressive. That's not the "secret sauce" as it were, in this growth equation. On that $49 billion in sales, Disney was able to generate about $7.5 billion in net profit. (Note that the above $13 billion referred to operating income). Contrary to the average revenue growth, this number is indeed notable. Profits went from $2.7 billion in 2005 to $7.5 billion by 2014 - representing nearly 12% annual growth. Suddenly we've knocked on a more impressive door. Net profit was able to increase much faster than sales due to margin improvement. In 2005 Disney's net profit margin was 8.5%. By 2014 this number had reached 15.4% - about 80% higher. The sales more or less moved along, but the quality of those sales improved dramatically. The net profit margin improved in eight of the nine years, resulting in a much larger bang for your revenue buck. And the story gets better. In 2005 Disney had roughly 2 billion common shares outstanding. As a result, the $2.7 billion in total profits equated to earnings per share of roughly $1.30. If the share count remained constant, the $7.5 billion in total company earnings of 2014 would have equated to an earnings-per-share number of roughly $3.75. This too would have represented annual growth of approximately 12%. Yet the number of shares outstanding did not remain the same. By 2014, via share repurchases, Disney had reduced its share count to 1.7 billion. As a result, long-term shareholders didn't have to split the underlying earnings claim with as many people and thus the earnings-per-share was higher. By 2014 Disney was earning about $4.30 per share - indicating a growth rate of 14% per year. This is an important realization to make: 4.8% total sales growth had been transformed into 14% earnings-per-share growth. Yet the tale is not yet fully spun. With such accelerated earnings-per-share growth the share price of Disney did not sit idly. At the end of the 2005 fiscal year, shares of Disney were trading hands around $24 . On a trialing basis, this would have represented a P/E ratio of about 18. Today shares of Disney exchange hands at a price around $116. Depending on how you think about trailing / current earnings, this represents an earnings multiple in the mid-20s, call it 25. So in addition to the three growth drivers listed above, investors also would have seen multiple expansion. The earnings-per-share, which grew faster than company profits, which outpaced Disney's revenue, were given a greater market value. Over that time period Disney's share price increased by nearly 18% per year (prior to thinking about dividends). That's a true fairy tale of a growth story. Perhaps that's not the perfect phrasing, as it actually occurred, but I think you get the idea. Four factors came together to allow Disney to provide exceptional investment growth over the past decade. While revenue growth was reasonable, it wasn't spectacular. Coming in at 4.8% per annum, you're not exactly primed to anticipate that you would make five times your money in just 10 years. Yet this is only the beginning of the story. Through margin improvement Disney was able to post total profit growth of about 12% per year. Add in the buyback boost and suddenly you see earnings-per-share grow by 14% per year. Finish it off with some multiple expansion and you have a storybook ending: 18% annual investment growth. The interaction of these factors is important in both understanding a company's past results along with determining their repeatability moving forward.
