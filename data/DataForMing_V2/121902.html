What Type Of Economy Will Disney Face In China As It Goes All In? - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Disney launched its largest store to date in China in May. launching the initial phase of its branding strategy. In early 2016 its Shanghai Disneyland should open, costing about $5.5 billion. The question now is what type of economy in China will the company face when both of these operations are running. With the May opening of its first store in China, the entertainment giant launched a major phase of its branding strategy to expand its brand and brand image in the Middle Kingdom. It's the largest store Disney has opened to date, as it prepares for its even larger launch of its Shanghai Disneyland in the spring of 2016. Disney (NYSE: DIS ) management is downplaying the recent crash of the Chinese market, but has to be concerned about the strength of the economy of China when the foundation of its initial plans for the country is completed. This stage of its branding efforts has focused on big, as evidenced by the Disney store, which includes 53,000 square feet of space . There is also an outdoor plaza for guests. The specific location in Shanghai was chosen for the approximate 40 million tourists to the city each year. That of course is the reason for placing Shanghai Disneyland in the area as well. Yet to be determined is the way the customers break down. Will they be primarily visitors from outside of China, as Disney hopes, or will a larger portion be from the domestic market? Either way, not only is China's very suspect economy a potential negative catalyst, but Asia itself has been struggling to maintain growth, with the exception of Vietnam, and that could pose a problem for Disney as it increases its exposure to China and Asia. Disney recently released more detail of its theme park in China, the first one to be developed on the mainland. It already has one in Hong Kong. According to CEO Bob Iger , the goal is to "create a truly magical place that is both authentically Disney and distinctly Chinese." The new theme park should open in spring 2016. Along with the six themed lands included at Shanghai Disneyland, there will also be two hotels and a theater, along with a number of shops. In a first for Disney and its theme parks, it will have a pirate theme, which will be named Treasure Cove. It will also build another Enchanted Storybook Castle there, with this one being the largest it has ever designed. Also part of the entertainment will be attractions with a Marvel and Star Wars theme. None of this has come cheap, as the company will spend approximately $5.5 billion on the theme park project before it's ready to open. In 2014 Disney's theme parks generated a little over $15.1 billion in revenue, and with its China theme park presumably opening in the spring of 2016, that could jump significantly up. The combination of all theme parks accounted for 31 percent of Disney's 2014 revenue. If it's successful, its parks and resorts unit could over time challenge its media networks division as the top producer for Disney. On the other hand, if it falters and China's economy underperforms, it could weigh on the company for some time. That's especially true if Chinese consumers start to hold more cash and cut back on spending. This would cause problems in the short term for Disney if that's how it plays out. Over the longer term, it's could be a nice additional revenue stream for the company. Where investors get concerned is in the lack of visibility in China, and not being able to completely trust the official data released by officials. What the recent market crash in China underscored and reinforced was it has been largely propped up by its government. That and the introduction of new rules on a daily basis during the height of the crisis revealed its leaders were in panic mode. The major problem for investors was the endless rule changes made it a game that couldn't be anticipated or analyzed in any consistent way. No one knew what new elements would come into the market on any given day. They still don't. What's most important about the Chinese stock market is it's still far too overvalued, and if Chinese consumers lost confidence in the government in regard to having an influence in its ongoing growth, it would get worse when the next correction comes. As for the economy itself, in the second quarter its GDP climbed 7 percent; in line with prior full-year projections. Even so, that's much less than the rate it has grown in the past, and there isn't much in the way of catalysts that would return to those levels. If consumers continue to be tight-fisted with their money after big losses in the stock market, it could take a lot more time than Disney believed to be profitable in China. As France has shown, not all theme parks of Disney are successful, and while the novelty of a Disney park in China, at the beginning, could overcome some of the economic obstacles that could emerge there. The good news is there are so many tourists, it could do well even if a number of Chinese decide to not travel to Shanghai. To me this is a long-term play by Disney, one that in the early stages is meant to be a marketing tool to get the Disney brand positioned in the minds of the Chinese consumer. That said, Disney will definitely want this to immediately do well in light of the growing economic concerns over China and that part of the world. If it opens soft, it will cast doubts on the project, which would take some of the sizzle out of the product. What happens in China between now and the opening of the theme park will be the key to its immediate success. If things appear to improve, consumers will soon forget the stock crash and be looking for a place to spend their money. If the Chinese economy slows and its stock market takes another downward turn, it would result in some disappointing numbers. Disney will take a hit if that happens, but for long-term investors the key will be to look at the Disney store and theme park as first, a branding tool, and secondly, a long-term strategy to boost its revenue and earnings in China. At this time the Chinese stock market and economy could go either way. That needs to be taken into consideration when considering the short-term impact on the share price and performance of Disney.
