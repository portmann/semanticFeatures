Facebook: Long-Term Investors Should Hold While Fleeting Capital Runs - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Facebook reported strong earnings results last week but the stock has shed value ever since. Opportunistic investors seeking breakout earnings performance bid up stocks like Facebook into earnings and leave them if they do not get their intended event catalyst result. But long-term investors should let that capital run off and not fret the temporary decline now being witnessed in FB shares, down nearly 5% in four days. The company's quarterly performance indicates the stock is on track for at least 20% average annual appreciation over the next five years. FB could do even better as it leverages the social media assets it is currently investing heavily in and the stock also could benefit from valuation expansion in that case. By now everyone should be aware of the fact that Facebook (NYSE: FB ) reported excellent earnings results last week. But the stock has come off its highs reached ahead of the report. That is because its performance, however excellent, was not good enough to keep the scarce capital resources of less patient investors in the stock at its valuation. Long-term holders, patient and willing to achieve a better than 20% annual appreciation rate in this stock, will be rewarded, but impatient speculative buyers who took positions into its earnings will seek more prospective pastures through earnings season. I suggest investors let the trading capital run away for now. It will return again at higher price levels to support even higher levels later on down the road. Followers of my column are well aware at this point of my long-term favor of Facebook shares. The stock is one of my favorite ideas for the next 3-5 years because of the earnings leverage I see coming across the important membership bases of many of its social media businesses. I have been on record with this view here at Seeking Alpha since the stock traded into the mid-$20s on its post-IPO falloff. It's also notable that I did not favor purchase of the shares at the IPO price on the IPO date. Despite my long standing faith in Facebook, I can understand why the shares gave way after earnings last week. It is because of the influence of the scarce but important capital resources of impatient investors (traders may be a more appropriate term) traversing from one stock to another through earnings season. It's "scarce" capital because it's a limited resource for investors on an individual basis who have many options to direct capital to. It's "important" because there is a lot of it across many traders willing to chase event catalysts during earnings season. That scarce yet important capital segment was bet on a blockbuster breakout for the stock on extraordinary and perhaps flawless performance. But in the run-up into the earnings release, the result was not enough to drive the stock even higher. Here's why long-term investors need not fret post-earnings slippage On the key measures for long-term investors, daily and mobile active users, Facebook excelled again in gaining the market share of the digitally inclined public. Daily Active Users (DAU) grew 17% year-to-year to 936 million on average for March 2015. Mobile DAUs grew 31% year-to-year to 798 million in March. Monthly Active Users (MAU) and mobile MAUs increased 13% and 24% to 1.44 billion and 1.25 billion, respectively. Upon this rock of users Facebook builds its church, so to speak, and leverages revenue streams. That process continues to be perfected and maximized, but is already at this moment generating astounding results , and more will come across some of Facebook's assets that it is just starting to monetize. Revenue from advertising increased 46% against the prior year quarter (55% before currency impact) to $3.32 billion. Mobile advertising revenue made up 73% of total advertising revenue, evidencing Facebook's successful transition to the clearly critical mobile platforms the world is using today. Most of Facebook's success is solely on its namesake social media site, but the company continues to grow memberships across its applications including WhatsApp and Messenger, and is investing heavily in Oculus. Revenues will continue to grow strongly as a result for years and may even gain pace, something sellers of the stock this week simply do not care about. FB shares are down 4.7% from their close just four days ago and since the earnings release. It is because of impatient trading capital flows now finding other stocks to seek big breakout gains from. I think we are seeing a similar trend in the shares of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) this week, as it reacted well after hours to its strong results but still shed capital nonetheless since. I do not make investment decisions based on technical analysis. But I will refer to technical price data to complement my fundamental research. FB shares are now testing their 50-day moving average, and the 100-day and 150-day averages are not far off. Thus, there is very strong technical support in the current vicinity to rest comfortably. Yet, long-term investors should not fret even despite that fact as the company continues to grow its top and bottom lines at great pace. Revenue rose 42% in the quarter and would have risen by 49% if not for the transitory impact of currency fluctuation. The bottom line increased at a pace of 20% because Facebook is smartly investing in its various assets. As a result, investors can expect the stock price to continue to rise at about a 20% pace on an annual basis if the stock is to simply keep its current valuation. But, if as I expect, Facebook begins to speed that growth pace up with the leveraging of its other social media assets, and also better leverages its Facebook namesake platform, well then investors will do better on bottom line growth and also possibly on valuation expansion. Estimates are seeing upward revision with the consensus for 2015 now showing $2.00 a share vs. $1.92 90 days ago. That trend is one I look for in growth stocks and I find reassuring to my thesis for this one. FB trades at 40X 2015 estimates and 31X next year's consensus EPS estimate at $2.61. Given expectations for further upward adjustment to these estimates, we must realize that this valuation is understating true value. Facebook is expected to grow its bottom line by 27% over the next five years, and this might also be understated. That means that its PEG value of 1.5X is likely understated, reassuring me that at minimum 20% annual price appreciation should be expected in FB shares. That's well worth some patience today as impatient trading money comes and goes. Hold on to your FB shares for the long-term, and I suggest new interests are wise starting here at the 50-day line.
