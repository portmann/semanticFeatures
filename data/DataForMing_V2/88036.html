Google: Payment Fees Aren't The Point - Google Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) | Seeking Alpha Google recently announced Android Pay as a launch partner with a new tokenization security service from Visa. The Visa plan includes blocking transaction fees on mobile payments for technology companies like Google. Google is positioned to benefit long term via other arrangements including marketing fees from credit card issuers and loyalty programs with consumers. Making money off any service is always a nice outcome, but sometimes the intent of services is to maintain customer loyalty or attract new customers. In the case of mobile payments, the vision heading into the end of May was that new payment providers would collect small fees that might eventually add up to billions. The news of the day suggests that the apple cart might have been turned over by the payment processors of Visa (NYSE: V ) and MasterCard (NYSE: MA ). With the recent release of Android Pay by Google (NASDAQ: GOOG )(NASDAQ: GOOGL ), the expectations were that the tech giant would garner transaction fees similar to Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). It only seemed logical that Google would sign a similar deal. The news though suggests Google was blocked out of the mobile payments fees and that Apple might be next. The payment networks including Visa introduced a new "tokenization" standard for card-security. The new Digital Enablement Program by Visa (VDEP) is designed to allow for financial institutions and technology companies to quickly scale mobile payments without complex connections. The company made the following statement in the press release regarding the fees for the platform: No-cost commercial framework: Financial institutions, merchants and technology companies can drive growth through a simple, scalable commercial construct with no pass-through fees between technology partners and financial institutions. At the time of the May 28 release, Visa listed Google as a launch partner. What isn't as obvious is why Google would so freely forego the fees that the card issuers agreed to pay Apple. Not to mention, the mobile payment services are the ones that control the consumers. Why allow Visa and MasterCard to dictate the transaction fees? The part that isn't clear - and what the market might misunderstand - is that the terms clearly state no pass-through fees, but the original Wall Street Journal article clearly states that marketing arrangements can still exist between technology firms and financial institutions. Otherwise, it seems very odd that Visa could legislate that it collects tons of fees while also blocking other participants from making money. Michael Cheng from paymentweek went further to explain the potential arrangements that will allow Google and possibly even Apple to make money without direct transaction fees from credit card issuers: Many expect Google to offer other types of moneymaking arrangements to affiliated banks. Marketing arrangements such as logo placement and other promotional terms could help the tech business profit from Android Pay while keeping its services enticing and affordable for consumers. The deal Apple obtained from the major banks is 0.15% of the credit card transactions values and $0.005 for each debit card purchase. The individual amounts are relatively small, but it would eventually add up to billions if enough customers use the service with trillions spent annually via debit and credit cards. If the news is accurately covered by the media that Apple will increasingly face pressure to not collect fees in Europe and eventually sign a similar deal in the U.S. when the current contracts are up in roughly two years, it ushers forward the theory that Apple and Google will look to push the payment networks out of the picture. The ongoing theory all along is that the technology companies would work out a method to eliminate the high costs and big margins that go to Visa and MasterCard that don't even take the financial risks. A couple options already in the works is the IBM (NYSE: IBM ) test using blockchain technology for a low-cost payment network and the major retailers working on their own payment system called CurrentC. Neither system appears a legitimate threat to the current payment networks, but the backing of a scorned Apple or Google that control the mobile customers could quickly kick start these or similar efforts. For now though, the amount that is at stake for Apple and Google is minimal. According to the numbers calculated by payments expert Karen Webster, Android Pay will only have an estimated 6 million phones with a current enough operating system and NFC capabilities to handle mobile payments. At the same time, common knowledge is that Android phone owners earn and spend considerably less than iPhone owners. Remember that $1 trillion spent via credit cards on Apple Pay is only equivalent to $1.5 billion in fees. Google expects total revenue to approach $75 billion this year and Apple is headed towards $230 billion in total revenue. The revenue potential from mobile payments is immaterial at this point to the levels the tech giants generate from current business lines. Visa alone processes close to $5 trillion in annual payments so it isn't that the payments spend doesn't exist for billions of fees, but the ability to capture a large percentage of the market will take a considerable amount of time and likely fail to match the other revenue buckets of the tech giants. One thing to keep in mind though is that Visa is worth $170 billion and produces annual revenue of around $13 billion. Combined with MasterCard, the top two payment networks are worth over $275 billion and generate annual revenue of $23 billion. These amounts are far from insignificant if Google or Apple could capture more of the revenue from payments in the future. Since a fraction of a percent of a small user base would add up to very little revenue currently, the impact is very minimal now. The bigger issue for Google is keeping consumers searching with Google on mobile phones. Google pointed out in its own blog post that 10 countries including the U.S. and Japan already see more searches via mobile devices than via desktop. The news of the last few weeks regarding mobile payments are no doubt interesting. Google apparently accepted a mobile payments agreement that doesn't include transaction fees, even though Apple managed to work a arrangement that included fees. The news is peculiar because it appears that Visa and MasterCard are trying to dictate terms to the technology giants. It doesn't appear all that clear whether Apple agrees with them. At the same time, the lack of transaction fees isn't as important to Google in the near term. The number of potential customers and the level of mobile payments won't add up to material revenues for a long time. Ultimately though, one needs to consider that the technology giants will eventually control the consumer payments experience via their mobile phones and the payment networks will disappear into the background. Google will eventually make its money from payments, but it just won't occur now. Source: Google: Payment Fees Aren't The Point Disclosure: The author is long AAPL.
