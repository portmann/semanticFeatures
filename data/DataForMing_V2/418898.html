Apple Watch: Still In Front Of The Growing Smartwatch Pack - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple Watch had the dominant share of smartwatch shipments in 2016 Q1. Shipments of smartwatches exceeded those of the Swiss watch industry in 2015 Q4, contributing to a marked decline in the Swiss watch industry. Recent articles by SA contributors Robert Lehar and Seth Golden presented dramatically differing views on the potential of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Watch. In this article I'll contribute my thoughts to the debate as well as indicate where I think Watch is going, both in terms of technology and market potential. With the advent of the smartphone, many don't bother to wear a watch. According to the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry , 1.026 billion watches were shipped in 2015. This compares favorably with the total number of smartphones shipped in 2015 of 1.433 billion, according to IDC . Despite the impact of the smartphone, there's still a sizable market for wrist watches. Unlike fad products such as 3D printers, smartwatches have a predecessor industry in electronic watches, and Lehar makes a persuasive case that the advent of the smartwatch is disrupting the watch industry. In addition to the steady decline in Swiss watch exports over the past year that Lehar pointed out, Strategy Analytics estimates that smartwatch shipments overtook Swiss watch shipments in 2015 Q4. According to Strategy Analytics 8.1 million smartwatches were shipped vs. 7.9 million Swiss Watches. The impact of the Watch is analogous to the iPhone itself. When iPhone entered the market in 2007, mobile communication was dominated by cell phones and features phones. Feature phones had more capable internal processors than the standard cell phone and could run simple apps for messaging, web browsing and games. Feature phones were an evolutionary step toward the smartphone made possible by continuing technological progress in microprocessors, displays, battery technology and wireless communication. iPhone carried these advances further by offering what amounted to a miniature personal computer with a touch screen for the user interface. The key features that distinguished iPhone from feature phones and the other smartphones of the time were a full fledged operating system, iOS and the ability to install apps to customize the phone. But iOS and apps would not arrive until later iterations of iPhone. The situation with smartwatches is very analogous to the situation in mobile communications when iPhone was introduced. The vast majority of watches sold in 2015 were electronic, about 1 billion, not the costly mechanical timepieces that the Swiss are noted for. Most of these are the wrist watch equivalent of the cell phone or the feature phone. Generally, electronic watches either just show the time or provide a few functions besides timekeeping. Smarter sports watches from the likes of Garmin (NASDAQ: GRMN ), Polar, Suunto and Timex offer heart rate monitoring, GPS capability and fitness tracking. Just as smartphones came to dominate the mobile communication market, I consider it inevitable that smartwatches will dominate the electronic watch market. The same technology innovations in processors, displays, batteries and wireless that enabled smartphones also are enablers for the smartwatch. This expectation is consistent with IDC's forecast for smartwatches. IDC predicts that by 2020 unit sales will reach over 82 million per year. For 2016, IDC predicts sales of 28.3 million, with Apple Watch having a dominant market share of 49.4%. For 2016 Q1, Apple Watch had the dominant share of the smartwatch category at 46% with 1.5 million units shipped, according to IDC . One way to think about the ascendency of mobile devices is to look at their energy efficiency. Although there are a number of factors that one can point to in terms of convenience and portability of mobile devices, energy efficiency is a metric that neatly sums up technological advances incorporated into mobile devices. Just as microprocessors have become smaller, they've also had to become more energy efficient simply to avoid overheating. In becoming more energy efficient, processors enabled the mobile device revolution. In the chart below, I illustrate the progress we've made in reducing the electrical power of our computing devices while at the same time increasing their computing power. Computing elements can be either a vacuum tube, transistor or a neuron. As we've increased the number of transistors on a chip, we've also decreased the power required by each transistor. This trend has allowed devices to get smaller and smaller until it's possible to put a fairly capable computer on somebody's wrist. I've argued that energy efficiency has been the key driver in market adoption of new more efficient electronic technology. The greater energy efficiency of mobile devices (both to manufacture and operate) makes them more cost effective for consumers. The cost effectiveness of mobile devices combined with their convenience and portability have driven market adoption. Even though progress in shrinking microelectronics seems to be slowing down, the continuing trend is for electronic devices to become smaller, more compact and more energy efficient. Shrinking the smartphone down to wristwatch size is a natural evolutionary step. Even though I believe Watch represents a natural evolution from the smartphone, evolution is not a smooth, frictionless process. It involves intense survival-of-the-fittest conflict and occasional dead ends. There were many attempts to build the smartphone before iPhone, including those by Nokia (NYSE: NOK ) and BlackBerry (NASDAQ: BBRY ). The small screen of the Watch does limit its functionality along traditional smartphone lines. Based on what we heard at Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) IO, I believe that the smartwatch industry is going to emphasize AI assisted voice input for smartwatches. With advancements in microphone technology and AI assistance that we're currently seeing in the Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Echo, combined with intelligent voice recognition and noise filtering, we'll be able to look at our watch as we normally would to tell time and do voice searches, dictate messages or make calls. Whether the next Watch will be able to operate fully independently from iPhone is doubtful. Although there are already some smartwatches on the market, such as the LG Watch Urbane 2 that features cellular LTE connectivity, Apple will probably elect not to include that in the next iteration of Apple Watch. There are still significant challenges in terms of the power drain on the battery due to the wireless radio. I expect Apple to phase in communications capability gradually with each succeeding generation. Probably the next generation will be capable of independent WiFi reception. This will allow it to make VoIP calls and receive updates and install apps without the assistance of a connected phone. These features will greatly enhance the usability of the device. Of course, we can expect a more powerful Apple designed SOC with more memory and storage, making the device more useful as a portable media player. Siri, Apple's sort of intelligent voice activated assistant, already is available on the Watch. With the more powerful SOC and WiFi will come the ability to use Siri without being tethered to an iPhone. Siri is still just an initial step in making Watch a link to a voice-controlled AI, but an important one, and we can expect Siri to be further enhanced in succeeding generations. It has been reported that Siri APIs will become available to developers, and, if so, this could be rolled out at WWDC in June. If the smartwatch is going to become our principal communications device, where does that leave the smartphone? Well, pretty disrupted, although it may take time (years) to become apparent. Yes, people will still need a larger portable screen, but here consumers will have a range of choices to suit their needs from larger tablets to smartphones. In effect, the smartphone will become just another tablet option. Traditional voice calling will fall by the wayside, although cellular connectivity will be an option, just as it is now with iPad. Apple's first generation Watch is not a perfect device primarily because it anticipates too much of the future that hasn't arrived yet. We're not quite to the point of being able to do reliable cellular comm on our wrists. We're not quite to the point of having an AI on our wrist either. But the technology is clearly moving in that direction. Certainly, Google made it very clear at IO that that's where they think the technology is going, and moved Android Wear 2 to anticipate that. The smartwatch isn't just going to be about Apple. There's going to be intense competition between Apple, Google and probably Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) that will drive innovation. A few years from now we'll be literally amazed at what they've been able to pack into the humble wrist watch. Apple critics don't give Apple enough credit for being willing to disrupt what is, after all, Apple's bread and butter product. But Apple has done this before. It disrupted the iPod with the iPhone, and it disrupted the Mac with the iPad. Generally the trend has been smaller, lighter, more energy efficient devices replacing larger, heavier, less energy efficient devices. The first generation of Apple Watch is in many ways less mature technically than the first generation iPhone. So it's a very good sign that Watch sales in the first year have outpaced iPhone sales in its first year, according to Daisuke Wakabyashi of the Wall Street Journal (also carried on Market Watch ). Considering the size of the wrist watch market and the smartphone market, I consider the prospects for Watch to be excellent. I remain long Apple and consider it to be a buy for investors with a 3-5 year investment horizon. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
