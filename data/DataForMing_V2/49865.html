Disney's Dividend: Eliminate It - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Disney pays a dividend, but many shareholders and pundits think the yield is low. There has also been criticism about the policy of paying the dividend only once per year. Disney's (NYSE: DIS ) dividend has been the subject of a lot of discussion over the years. Many observers believe the dividend yield on the stock is too low given the company's cash-flow-generation characteristics. Others talk about how Disney's policy of paying the dividend on an annual basis is unattractive to income investors. I think those who have made such observations are entirely correct. Disney is a powerful media brand that booked over $6 billion in free cash flow in fiscal year 2014. The amount in dividends paid for that time period was about $1.5 billion. The company also used $6.5 billion to buy back shares. The annual dividend is particularly quizzical. It has been stated in the past that paying a quarterly dividend is expensive; there are many shareholders who only own a few shares from what I understand. Not sure how prohibitively expensive it actually is; I asked the company what the cost to pay the dividend is, but I received no answer, as one would probably expect. In some sense, it seems as if the dividend is an afterthought to CEO Bob Iger and the board. That got me thinking: perhaps Disney should simply eliminate the dividend. I enjoy total return; I like it when there is growth matched with a real payout. There's obviously nothing wrong with such a setup. Disney, however, has been a tremendous growth stock. All one has to do is look at the chart. Currently, the 52-week low is $78.54 and the 52-week high is $111.66. The shares are priced much closer to the high. Iger has been pleasing Wall Street for a long time. The stock has done very well against the broader market, and his investments in content have not only resulted in blockbuster films that have returned excess cash against their budgets, but they have helped power the theme parks, the consumer-products portfolio, and other business segments. What could Iger do with an extra $1.5 billion? What if he didn't have the pressure to increase the dividend? Let me stop here for a brief moment and say that I don't mind earning a dividend on my Disney shares. Why would I, right? However, if it's only going to be paid annually -- a practice that I do mind, very much so -- then I do sometimes wonder what the point of it is. The yield is low, the payment arrives once every year, and it's not like the stock hasn't been growing. An extra $1.5 billion could be used for more movies and TV shows. Maybe a small acquisition (perhaps Disney could go shopping for more multichannel networks on YouTube). More risks could be taken, which isn't a bad thing considering how Disney seems to approach the risks associated with Hollywood. The quality-tentpole strategy is certainly working out. The board could also work toward reducing (and hopefully one day eliminating) the debt on the balance sheet (Disney listed borrowings at about $12 billion on its balance sheet as of the end of 2014). Yes, debt is cheap, but a lower quantity of debt is always preferable. Let's be honest: the premise that an annual dividend is necessary to contain costs may not be entirely credible (let us know what it costs under a quarterly schedule, Disney). I find more probable the idea that the company may simply want to hold on to the cash for a longer amount of time. If that is the case, and if many shareholders do indeed wish for a higher dividend paid out on a quarterly basis, then maybe Disney might be better off going for all-out growth by retaining all monies and investing in its mighty brand power and its successful intellectual properties.
