S&P 500 flat; Yellen sees no reason to reverse hike plan | Reuters The S&P 500 ended flat on Wednesday, losing gains late in the session as investors digested comments by Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, who kept options open for more rate hikes but also saw risks to the U.S. economy. The Dow and S&P posted their fourth straight day of losses while the Nasdaq ended its three-day down streak. The market had traded higher for much of the session after Yellen told Congress she does not expect the central bank to reverse the rate hike program it began in December. But Yellen also acknowledged tightening financial conditions and uncertainty about China. "The market was strong (early in the day) because Janet Yellen confirmed the fact the Fed would go very slow on rate hikes because the economy was showing some signs of sluggishness," said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI closed down 99.64 points, or 0.62 percent, to 15,914.74, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 0.35 points, or 0.02 percent, to 1,851.86 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 14.83 points, or 0.35 percent, to 4,283.59. U.S. stocks have struggled since the start of the year amid mounting worries over a slowdown in global and U.S. economic growth.

Materials and energy shares were Wednesday's biggest losers following further losses in U.S. oil prices. A 3.8 percent drop in Walt Disney (DIS.N) shares was the biggest drag on the Dow. Disney dropped to $88.85 after reporting lower profit at its ESPN sports network. Technology and healthcare shares rebounded from recent losses, however. The S&P technology index .SPLRCT was up 0.4 percent while healthcare .SPXHC was up 0.9 percent.
