ETF Hub Aug 31 2015, 16:25 ET | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor "Apple is going to create a massive consumer appetite for blocking ads," says an online ad industry exec quoted by the WSJ in an article about Apple's plans to support 3rd-party Mobile Safari ad-blockers within iOS 9. Another exec: "The ad-blocking problem is real and growing, and ad-blocking on iOS is only going to accelerate it." The paper notes (per Adobe and PageFair) an estimated 198M users worldwide ran ad blockers as of June (up 40% Y/Y), and that Wells Fargo estimates ad blockers will hurt 2016 Internet ad spend by $12.5B. The performance/battery life benefits of ad blockers can be particularly big on mobile devices. Notably, Apple isn't supporting the use of ad blockers for mobile apps, arguing ads don't hurt app performance as much as they hurt browsing performance. Apple competes in the iOS in-app advertising space via its iAd platform. Criteo, which delivers retargeted e-commerce ads both to sites and apps, tumbled to $39.26 today. Its shares also fell in June when news first emerged of Apple's plans to support ad blockers within Mobile Safari.
