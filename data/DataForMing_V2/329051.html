Intel And Qualcomm Have Jumped Into Bed Together, Part 2 - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Qualcomm has recently joined Intel-backed Internet of Things group OCF. The upcoming end of Moore’s Law is bringing Intel and Qualcomm closer. Koomey’s Law will drive chipmakers to produce technologically advanced chips in the absence of Moore’s Law. Since the Internet of Things and WiGig/Wi-Fi don’t need huge processing power, Intel and Qualcomm are well-positioned in these areas, compared to other chipmakers. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ), the semiconductor arch rivals, are continuing their efforts to come closer to each other. In a previous article , I explained the rationale behind the collaboration between the two companies for taking WiGig mainstream. A few days ago, Qualcomm joined a new Internet of Things group, named the Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF, in short). OCF is actually the new name of the Intel-backed group Open Interconnect Consortium (OIC, in short). In this article, I explain how OCF will help the chipmakers grow together. End of Moore's Law Bringing Intel and Qualcomm Closer Intel was at the forefront of the OIC, which was formed in 2014 for addressing the challenges of the Internet of Things. Qualcomm was not a part of the group. Instead, it was a part of a competing group, namely AllSeen Alliance. Why has Qualcomm joined OCF, which was originally backed by rival Intel? I am coming to that point. In addition to Qualcomm, Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) have also joined OCF. However, the initiative has different implications for Intel and Qualcomm than the rest of the companies because both Intel and Qualcomm will face a stumbling block going forward that won't be conducive for their growth. What's that? The end of Moore's Law. For Intel, Qualcomm and other chipmakers that depend on consumers replacing the chips of their devices every two or three years, the end of Moore's Law could lead to significant revenue loss. Amid such a situation, Intel and Qualcomm have joined hands to grow together by taking advantage of their leadership position in PCs and smartphones respectively. Intel has acknowledged that in future processors will become slower in terms of performance. But, at the same time, they will be more energy efficient. William Holt, head of Intel's Technology and Manufacturing Group, recently said : We're going to see major transitions. The new technology will be fundamentally different. The best pure technology improvements we can make will bring improvements in power consumption but will reduce speed. That's a revolutionary revelation, which in essence means that Moore's Law will come to an end. The law suggested that the density of integrated circuits doubles every two years while the manufacturing cost reduces, and therefore the chips become faster as well as cheaper. Here's the paper containing the law, which was published back in 1965. Once the chips hit 5nm on silicon, chipmakers have to deal with quantum mechanics in terms of preventing quantum tunneling via logic gates. Since quantum mechanics allows electrons to penetrate logic gates, it is widely believed that 5nm will mark the end of Moore's Law. How would chipmakers make money when Moore's Law ends? The Internet of Things will save the chipmakers, especially leaders like Intel and Qualcomm, when Moore's Law ends. However, they need to develop a well-defined ecosystem to retain their market share. The primary problem with the Internet of Things is that most of the devices can't communicate with each other in the absence of a common ecosystem. Intel and Qualcomm know this. Qualcomm has agreed to become a part of Intel-backed OCF for developing an ecosystem. Unlike the world of PCs and smartphones where the existence of a common ecosystem wasn't essential (and therefore the Intel-Qualcomm rivalry wasn't a problem), a common ecosystem will be most essential for the world of connected homes and cars. When the Internet of Things will become full-blown, there will be hundreds of devices (in contrast to primarily PCs or smartphones today), that will talk to one another. Intel said : By allowing providers to build on a single, open standard, OCF will drive secure interoperability for consumers, business, and industry, which is key to unlocking the massive opportunity, accelerating industry innovation, speeding product development and spurring adoption. Interoperability of different devices will create demand for more such devices. For example, a connected bulb will create the demand for a hub and a remote controller for switching the bulb on and off. The bulb can also be operated without a remote controller, using a smartphone or a tab. In any case, the demand for chips will rise to keep pace with increasing availability of different devices. An article written by SA author Mark Hibben suggested that the collaboration between Intel and Qualcomm on WiGig doesn't necessarily imply they are becoming friends. Hibben criticized my article mentioned in the beginning saying that it's not unusual for rival companies to play nice to each other when it comes to developing standards, and beyond that they remain competitors as usual. I welcome constructive criticism, because this helps us become better investors. The things is, after developing a common standard for the next technology frontiers, such as WiGig/Wi-Fi or the Internet of Things, chipmakers have to support hardware (including chips) made by even competitors to ensure smooth adoption of devices. This is the building block of interoperability. In the absence of Moore's Law, chipmakers will be driven by Koomey's Law to produce energy-efficient chips. Koomey's Law says , "At a fixed computing load, the amount of battery you need will fall by a factor of two every year and a half." Koomey's Law doesn't deal with computing horsepower. But that's not a problem. The Internet of Things and WiGig/Wi-Fi, the new growth areas for Intel and Qualcomm, don't need much computing horsepower. Both Intel and Qualcomm are "long-term buys."
