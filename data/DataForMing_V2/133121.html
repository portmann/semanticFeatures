Netflix Uses TCA Presence To Re-Establish Messaging And Strong Industry Presence - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Netflix's TCA day reveals were very status quoist, but that's okay given the strong position the streaming service holds in the industry. Other networks are beginning to stop complaining about the network's competitive advantage and to start trying to mimic it in their own unique way. That's how long it took Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) topper Ted Sarandos to get asked a question about Adam Sandler at Tuesday's start of the summer edition of the Television Critics Association press tour in Los Angeles. The questions didn't get any easier from there, but Sarandos knew that. This isn't his first time at the TV industry staple, and with a stock price of over $700, it won't be his last either. Netflix is a beast - there's no other way to put it. It's a legit beast, and it is coming hard at the traditional networks. Let me put it like this... almost a decade ago, when the major league baseball team, the Tampa Bay Rays, were still the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, a popular sports website posted fake mock slogans for all 32 MLB teams. At that point, the Rays were not the powerhouse they eventually came to be (for a time), but they were close, and their slogan was "Last chance to laugh at us." During that time, the streaming giant, at its start , had just two original series - now it has 16, and all total 475 hours of original programming. It also had 11 panels at TCA this year... the most of any network. Of course, by far the most interesting panel is the one that featured Sarandos alone on stage being grilled by members of the media. The whole thing in general is a fascinating exercise that still shows the value of critics, analysts and the media overall. These executives voluntarily sit down for 30-45 minutes twice a year to get basically attacked by reporters. Some executives are cocky, and have every reason to be, and some would be dead in the water if it weren't for extensive media training by expensive PR teams. Yet, they all do it, one after the other. What's interesting, though, is seeing the ebb and flow. NBC, for example, was at its lowest low a few years ago, but as of late, it's king of the hill (for now). Netflix, though, has always remained among the more steady networks, and that's because it holds a competitive advantage above all others... it doesn't release ratings. As proved again on Tuesday, during the panel for Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, even the show's creators have no clue as to how many people watch their series. That means Tina Fey, one of the industry's top and most respected showrunners, is as in the dark as you and I. Say what you want if that's fair or not (and I know someone is bound to comment on it below), but the point is moot. This is not going to change, and rival networks have even begun to take a page out of that playbook and realize they don't need to report on their online offerings either. Check out NBC's wording of who was watching its Aquarius. Remember, this is a series that did so badly in the traditional ratings, it was bumped to Saturday night... TV's graveyard. And it still got RENEWED. Even Sarandos poked fun at that scenario. So what did Netflix say during its panel that would be of interest to investors? Would it take the stage and make a bombshell announcement? No... it didn't, but again, it didn't have to, as status quo is good for the network, and quite frankly, it had nothing to prove that wasn't already clearly on display. For a organization that, for years, wouldn't fully welcome bloggers into its membership ranks to now have days devoted to streaming media is a very powerful statement. Among the announcements made on Tuesday were air dates for the new season of Bojack Horseman, the re-birth of the resurrected Longmire and what seems like a laundry list of stand-up specials from "A-list" level comedians. In addition, Netflix is working on locking in another season of Arrested Development and getting the Olsen Twins to participate in Full House spin-off Fuller House (which actually sounds like it could be possible now). Paired with the success of series like House of Cards, Orange Is The New Black, Bloodline and Grace & Frankie (not to mention Daredevil), Netflix continues to look like the powerhouse it has proven to be. Now, I'm not saying this to get a fight going in the comments or get a bump in my page views. I'm saying this because it's the truth, and that's evident by the fact that all of this has happened in a three-year span - and in the TV industry, that's a record pace. It's also what has inspired Netflix to jump into original films, which takes me back to Adam Sandler. As I mentioned, it took six minutes for someone to ask Sarandos about his network's four-picture deal with the comedian. As I mentioned last week before Pixels even the theaters, a lackluster performance should have minimal impact on Netflix, and that's what exactly what Sarandos said to reporters looking for red meat. We did our deal with Adam Sandler because he is an enormous international movie star. We are as encouraged as ever. Sarandos wouldn't be baited into saying something salacious... he is too smart for that. He later went on to double-down and say "I don't feel I have to defend Adam Sandler," and he's right. Netflix makes original series based on what the network perceives to be the best for its audience, and there's no reason for that strategy to change with original films. It's also worth pointing out that what Netflix is doing here is no different from what its rivals do... it is just perhaps doing it better. All of the networks have the ability to mine their data for what their audiences like and mold their plans from that point... it is just that in this case, nobody knows what is in that data, which is what's become the news. Now yes, you can say there's no hard numbers proof that House of Cards and its brethren are ratings successes, but it's hard to deny that they are successful in general. The boost that comes from critical buzz, word of mouth and awards season glory is hard to deny. The truth is that the old school method is fading, and this is the future, and in case you forgot that, Netflix is happy to remind you... over and over and over again.
