Zillow: The Perfect Opportunity For Aggressive Growth - Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) | Seeking Alpha Have a question? Google it. Heard about a show? Netflix it. Interested in a house? Zillow it. There is something about today's culture that we enjoy making proper names into nouns. It is an idiosyncrasy in which the growth investor can profit enormously, because this language trend reflects the moat of a company in the minds of its users. Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) became the go-to for search and then monetized and expanded. Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) became the go-to for on-demand entertainment, and then transitioned and created its own source of "upstream production" by creating original content. By continuously developing Google and Netflix have dominated their markets. Zillow (NASDAQ: Z ) has cornered the marketplace for real estate advertising, an industry estimated at $13 billion by Zillow CEO Spencer Rascoff. Shareholders in the three previously mentioned companies have been generously rewarded for their investment in the past 5 years: Google's 5 year average annual return has been 31.6%, and Netflix has put up 45.4% per year (helped along by its staggering 125% increase YTD). Zillow, having just reached its 4 year anniversary of IPO, has increased at 29% per year. All three have greatly outperformed the S&P's 88% return in that timeframe. Well they should as they are all fantastic companies with growing revenues as well as exciting future prospects. Speaking about revenues, the Google and Netflix juggernauts have increased the money brought in by 125% and 150%, in the past five years. Zillow has increased their revenue in four years by almost 1000%. Another way to put it is that is more revenue growth in one year for Zillow than revenue growth (%) for Google and Netflix's last five years combined. These revenues show no real signs of slowing, as the housing market is really just beginning to rebound from fallout of the housing bubble. This is the first and most important catalyst to future earnings. A Bloomberg article speaks to this microeconomic tailwind for Zillow which is just beginning. Housing starts, an indicator which tracks new building permits issued, rose 9.8% from May to June. More homes means a broader market and user base for Zillow. The chief economist of the National Association of Realtors summed it up the rise in home starts this way: "Home values are rising too fast and we need more supply to bring the price growth down, consistent with income growth." The housing recovery is just now gaining real steam. A casual viewing of census.gov's Houses Sold by Region log shows first that the market is recovering, and second that we are a long way from the norm. Starting in 2011 one can see the annual houses sold rising from 306K to 368K to 429K to last year's 437K. Disregarding the home sales numbers directly after the housing crash, the last time this few houses were sold was in 1982. In 2003, long before the bubble's zenith, over a million houses were sold per year. Home sales have a long runway to even attain normalcy. In addition to this, interest rates are set to rise for the first time in 6 years by the end of this year. If anything will spur people to go out and buy homes, it's the fear that rates will rise before they can lock down a fantastic rate. 2016 should see an explosion of home buyers, as this becomes a more common trend of thought. The first question is how Zillow makes money. Zillow's business model relies on partnerships with realtors for the majority of its revenue, with the rest coming from ads. It is very simple, the kind of business everyone can readily understand. That's the kind of business that I like to invest in. The realtor network partnership growth is exploding, while the display revenue is still growing swiftly though outstripped by the marketplace revenue. Z was able to build on brand recognition in order to move from ad revenue to the much larger realtor partnership model. Zillow's unaudited operating metrics clearly point to the transition from advertisement-based revenue to valuable partnerships. "Marketplace revenue" rose to 82% of total revenue in 2014, up from 78.3% in 2013 and 74% in 2012, and only 64% in 2011. Marketplace revenue is growing at an outstanding rate. From 2011-2012 it more than doubled, and in the past two years it has increased by more than 72% each year. In all of these years the housing market has been very slowly recovering, and with an inevitable housing recovery catalyst for the foreseeable future, marketplace revenue should continue to grow aggressively. Display revenue, while not a driver on the earnings as much as marketplace revenue, is still growing at a 35% annual clip. Advertisements will continue to be a source of stable revenue, as average monthly unique users was over 75 million in 2014. Investor sentiment has lagged this rapid increase of revenue, particularly in the last year. Z is down over 40% in that timeframe, as costs of incorporating Trulia into Zillow Group hit the balance sheet and the impact of ex-CFO Chad Cohen's resignation. I believe these two occurrences to be short-term drags on the stock price, and fantastic opportunities to buy on the pullback, as the incorporation of Trulia's business constitutes the second catalyst for Z. Z hasn't done so hot since announcing the Trulia acquisition plan. Zillow's $3.5 billion acquisition of Trulia was a monumental one. In acquiring the #2 player in the real estate advertising market, and added on Trulia's focus on renters. Zillow cut duplicate functions in sales and support in order to maximize acquisitive synergies. This is a very important consideration for a growth company; its speaks very well to the future prospects of a growth company when they prune costs as they are rapidly growing. This acquisition certainly has short term negatives on Zillow's balance sheet in fees (legal, accounting, regulatory filing, etc.), as well as Trulia's debt taken on by Zillow and dilution of shares in the share-for-share acquisition. The long term positives include business synergies, a greater market share, and an expected $100 million in annualized cost savings by 2016. Considering that Zillow paid a premium of 25% to Trulia's stock price, the $3.5 billion represents an $875 million premium for added value to Zillow (assuming investors had valued Trulia fairly). Zillow's investment will thus be paid for in less than 9 years in synergies alone (at the $100 million/year rate of savings). Although the price for Trulia was dear, the long term benefits of this acquisition seem to justify the expense. Spurred on by tailwinds in the real estate industry, the combined Zillow-Trulia marketplace will be in prime position to capitalize. Zillow has kept mum about Cohen's reasons for leaving, as he himself has, but there are too many considerations to try and play a guessing game. The financial picture is trending in the right direction, and with a lot of momentum. That is what matters. The last catalyst is an opportunity to receive share dividend in mid August. Class A and B shareholders will receive two shares of new non-voting "Class C" shares for every share they have. While many will be quick to point out this is just a dilution, it is one which will greatly benefit Class A shareholders compared to future investors. If there is a perfect time to invest in Z it is before August 14th. As a post-script to the catalysts, a hidden future opportunity might lie in Zillow's newest acquisition of DotLoop, a company that "simplifies real estate transactions by enabling brokerages, real estate agents, and their clients to share, edit, sign and store documents digitally." ( Zillow Press release ). According to Zillow, 500,000 people sign real estate documents on Dotloop per month. As compiling documents and organizing appointments to go into banks to sign terms is one of the most annoying things in the free world, DotLoop could spell a huge future profit center. This could be a gem of an acquisition for Zillow. Zillow is an aggressive growth company that will explode in stock price within the next year. Various factors lend credence to this claim, including market position, past earnings, and macroeconomic and microeconomic tailwinds, and synergies. The dividend of Class C shares round out the opportunity and make this the perfect time to act. Sun Trust analyst Bob Peck sure agrees : he calls for $130 PT and $685 million revenue for fiscal year 2015 (110% yoy increase). Next time you see a house for sale, don't just "Zillow it," buy Z.
