Submitted by Mac Slavo via SHTFPlan.com, Iphone maker Apple, Inc. claimed last month that their latest iteration of the wildly popular handheld device was unhackable. According to HackRead , the company is so convinced of its security successes that they issued a statement saying that data stored on a phone secured with a front screen passcode was impossible to access – even by highly talented intelligence agencies: The CIA and the FBI are always looking for backdoors in Apple devices, in fact, the agency spent years trying to hack iPhone and iPads according to documents released by NSA’s Edward Snowden. Now, with the new upgraded operating systems, Apple  has termed it “impossible” to access any data from Apple devices. Though, the company can still access data from older phones. According to the Apple’s response to the court, 90 percent of the devices has ios 8 installed and with the type of encryption already there in the phone, it’s nearly impossible to access the data without the passcode, which is only known to the original owner. Even Apple itself cannot find the code. But as we already know from recent hacks of Department of Defense computers, essential domestic grid infrastructure computers, and even NASA’s in-orbit spacecraft , in the digital age nothing is ever really secure. Within hours of Apple releasing their latest iOS 9 update a cyber security firm known as Zerodium issued a challenge to the hacker community and offered up a $1 million bounty for any team that could bypass Apple’s latest security features. For weeks it appeared that Apple was right. Scores of hackers around the world burned the midnight oil trying to hack the iphone before Zerodium’s bounty expired. But just few hours before the challenge came to end, one team submitted their exploits and vulnerabilities and Zerodium has confirmed that the Apple’s iOS 9 has been compromised. The exploits, according to experts, would give snoopers the ability to not only access the data on your phone, but intercept calls, text messages and even live chat conversations. Here’s the kicker: the exploit is remote, so it can be launched on your phone without you even knowing about it. Simply visiting a web site or receiving a certain kind of text message could initiate the jailbreak process on your phone and then install unwanted (and hidden) monitoring apps. According to Motherboard , the unhackable has been hacked… again: Bekrar explained that the winning team found a “number of vulnerabilities” in Chrome and iOS to bypass “almost all mitigations” and achieve “a remote and full browser-based (untethered) jailbreak.” If true, this is a considerable feat. No one had found a way (at least that’s publicly known) to jailbreak an iPhone remotely for more than a year, since iOS 7 . there’s no doubt that for some, this exploit is extremely valuable. Intelligence agencies such as the NSA and the CIA have run into problems when trying to hack into iPhones to spy on their targets, and the FBI has publicly complained about Apple’s encryption for months. This exploit would allow them to get around any security measures and get into the target’s iPhone to intercept calls, messages, and access data stored in the phone. A source, who used to work for the NSA, told Motherboard a few weeks ago that $1 million is actually a good price for such an exploit, because “if you sell it to the right people” you can fetch much more. You probably already know the answer: Bekrar and Zerodium, as well as its predecessor VUPEN, have a different business model. They offer higher rewards than what tech companies usually pay out, and keep the vulnerabilities secret, revealing them only to certain government customers, such as the NSA. So just in case you thought your data and private activities were safe from spying eyes, think again. The very people who we want to keep out of our private lives are the ones who will be the beneficiaries of the jailbreak.

Tue, 11/03/2015 - 17:53 | 6746237 The Pope Y'ad think that the NSA would just automatically put you on a 'douche' list just for buying an iPhone. As such, the need to hack appears redundant. The "intelligence agencies" have made sure there are no "communications devices" that they cannot listen in on. It seems a self-aware system would make it job 1 to prevent being hacked. But could an A.I. system be "bought"? Tue, 11/03/2015 - 19:29 | 6746598 uhland62 Every wall one man can build another man can tear down. Am I to believe that 'the agencies' engage in hacking to access phones? They get all the passords on a silver platter - or else. But they pretend to stick to a process, because it looks good. But training in hacking never goes astray.  When money vanishes from your account, the agencies might well have done self service - after all they have all passwords. But they always say it's the Chinese or the Russians. The only way to avoid getting fleeced by the agencies is not to do online banking. When your account is not registered for online debits from you, nobody can pretend digitally to be you. If money vanishes the account holder cannot be blamed and the bank must refund illegal outlflow - and you do not have to argue about the safety of your device.  Tue, 11/03/2015 - 17:59 | 6746266 Boris Alatovkrap Funny thing... you are notice once Barry is neuter NASA, remove Aerospace function, all is left is NSA which is now where much funding (and all of Amerikanski personal information) is go. This is coincidence, or evil plot to destroy Amerika? Tue, 11/03/2015 - 19:29 | 6746609 Eng7 MsErable. As opposed to Android devices, whos manufacturers stop giving security updates after less than a year! Apple have been giving 4-5 years of update support for their hardware.

Both my laptop and my desktop are set up to run Windoze (if I absolitely have to), Linux (Ubuntu) and Mac OS Security is a whole different ball game. I've always assumed that if I can access another computer remotely that some other bugger can access mine, and have acted accordingly. Tue, 11/03/2015 - 20:07 | 6746745 Groundhog Day Other then the better resolution and slightly better speed, their is nothing special about the high end phones.  I already know so many people buying refurbished androids for around a hundred bucks.  They are tired of the anxiety of not dropping, getting it wet, losing it.  Just this week a friend dropped left one in a cab.  Ordered another refurbished one that day for next day delivery.  A galaxy s4, just as good as any new 900 dollar phone and no hassles about insurance and all the other bs Who waits in line for days to be one the first few to say they have a new Tim Cook product?

My bill is cheap too. Go ahead hack it, lol like I give a shit.

Jeez, if you want to wait 8 hours to read your email after you get home...  Tue, 11/03/2015 - 20:37 | 6746844 logicalman Tue, 11/03/2015 - 17:45 | 6746196 weisswurst Tue, 11/03/2015 - 18:22 | 6746354 omniversling There is much more, but here is a basic oveview of NSA hacking capabilities.

Tue, 11/03/2015 - 18:22 | 6746364 Shift For Brains Bekrar and Zerodium, as well as its predecessor VUPEN, have a different business model. They offer higher rewards than what tech companies usually pay out, and keep the vulnerabilities secret, revealing them only to certain government customers, such as the NSA. I've said this before. The vast majority of these corruptions and obscene acts against We The People will slow to a trickle is the day these companies start having employees missing, employees families missing, employees cars and homes missing...you get the picture. Tue, 11/03/2015 - 18:49 | 6746450 Implied Violins Using it for anything except phone calls you don't care about others eavesdropping upon is fucking retarded. And, leave your global citizen monitoring / tracking device / smart phone at home if you have any fucking sense at all.
