Veterans Day Is Armistice Day In Wireless: Which Company Wins The Price War Truce? | Seeking Alpha T-Mobile's recent announcement of its new Binge On feature overshadowed a fundamental shift in their market strategy. Prices and fees have reached almost Big Two levels. The new Big Three's convergence on price means that they are now competing essentially on data bucket size and network quality only. T-Mobile wins on one but not the other. Verizon remains the most reliable network and recently tweaked its own pricing plans to better resemble T-Mobile's. It should benefit from the easing of pricing pressure. T-Mobile faces increasing risks as its new initiative strains its network just as it's about to abandon its low-price position. Sprint may now have an opening to become the new market disruptor, but the continued hemorrhaging of cash will still pose a risk for investors as it tries to execute. Almost all world nations mark some sort of holiday on November 11th commemorating the signing of the initial cease-fire with Germany that ended World War I. Some call it Remembrance Day, in honor of the soldiers, while others call it Armistice Day, honoring both the soldiers and the idea of peace itself, whose arrival the treaty was meant to herald. The U.S., however, has always rather gone its own way on these sorts of things. Feet not meters, pounds not kilograms. And so we call it Veterans Day. Apparently, though, someone forgot to copy the wireless industry on the whole no-armistice memo. Because this year we were treated to a sight that has been missing in the industry the last three years: peace actually broke out. Not that the competition seemed to get any less volatile. T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS ) had just launched the biggest volley in its Un-Carrier war since the original Simple Choice announcement the day before. As usual, Legere got a few digs in at "dumb and dumber," the Big Two wireless duopoly. He accused them of trying to copy everything he does, which actually isn't too far off lately. Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) in particular seems to be waking up to the threat, announcing a new overhaul of its pricing scheme, and in a way to make it unmistakably more Un-Carrier like. Legere also said their efforts were falling flat because they still charge too much, and that seemed to land home, too. Verizon matched T-Mobile's introductory price of $50 for 1 GB of data on one line with unlimited voice/text, but T-Mobile had retained pricing advantages on every other tier. It offered lower prices than Verizon on adding lines ($10 instead of $20) and adding data ($10 instead of $15) and it still offered an unlimited data plan for $30, which Verizon no longer did. The one price winner Verizon had , a 500MB option for $45 on one line, was eliminated. Legere was most proud, however, of T-Mobile's no overage guarantee, which he said saved customers much more than they realized because while actual overages charged only comes to about $2.5 billion a year, the Big Two's customers only protect themselves from overages by buying bigger data buckets than they need, resulting in $45 billion in data that goes unused and lost. Then Legere unveiled Binge On, T-Mobile's latest shot at the old wireless ways of AT&T (NYSE: T ) and Verizon. But buried beneath the pomp and festivities of the announcement there was a clear shift. Binge On is not so much a clear benefit as a trade-off, requiring downgrading streaming video to Standard Definition to reduce data consumption. And even then Binge On is only unmetered for those on 6 GB plans and up, making it likely that more T-Mobile customers than ever will be paying a $10-$15 surcharge per line. And even customers on their lower priced plans who don't get the free video data will see their streams default to the lower setting, a rather sneaky, duopoly-like move for the rebellious carrier. The fine print of Binge On was not the only way T-Mobile is becoming more like Verizon. Prices went up $5 per data increment, which greatly expanded the parity between T-Mobile and Verizon pricing. Now, the first three data tiers for T-Mobile and Verizon are priced identically, with each charging a $15 upgrade to move up to the next data bucket ($50, $65, $80.) T-Mobile did offer one way to avoid the price increases: join Family Match. Family Match is their new name for a program where data increments stay at the old $10 per line price, but only if everyone on the plan buys the same amount of data. That would likely mean that many T-Mobile customers would end up buying data they don't really need, just like Legere accused Verizon of doing. It's still not shared data with overages, but it's closer to it than T-Mobile has ever come before. Meanwhile, in addition to the changes to their Share Everything family plans, Verizon tacked on an additional $20 a month to its last remaining unlimited data users. Those users already lost the right to a biannual smartphone upgrade back in 2012. So this brings their monthly data plan to $50 a month plus the voice/minute charges and no subsidy on their smartphones. The cheapest voice/text combination available when Verizon was last selling unlimited was $45 a month, so that comes to $95 a month plus the cost of the smartphone. On Armistice Day, Legere announced that T-Mobile's unlimited data plan would be going up to the exact same price. Because of all the price hikes, Verizon has made on its unlimited customers only "about 1 percent," or 1-2 million customers, still have them. But it still seems pretty noteworthy. For the first time since taking over T-Mobile, "dumb" or "dumber" - Legere never said which one Verizon is - raised prices and Legere did not scream or shout. Well, no, he still did that. But then he matched the price increase. He's never done that before. Both companies' changes took effect November 15th and are now official. AT&T waited a few weeks and then announced a much smaller $5 hike for its grandfathered unlimited customers. But they were already sitting much closer to where Verizon and T-Mobile are headed. When AT&T stopped offering unlimited data, the best price one could get it for was $100 for unlimited voice and data on one line or $180 for two, plus a $20-$30 texting surcharge. But, unlike its two competitors, AT&T lets people with those old plans continue to receive discounted smartphone upgrades, a $450 biannual value per line if they buy an iPhone. That brings the cost per line down to about $96.25 per line, averaging the single and multi-line prices and including the small price hike. Right near or about where T-Mobile and Verizon are. Competition in wireless is far from dead, but it is changing. When T-Mobile first started Un-Carrier, almost everything it did pertained in some way to lowering prices. Sometimes it was clear, such as when it eliminated contracts, eliminated overages, or made global roaming free. Other times it was more subtle, but it was still there. Music Freedom, for example, was technically a new service benefit, not a price cut. But since music streaming was one of the big eaters of a data plan, Music Freedom meant that customers could downgrade their data plan without really losing anything, since music was now unmetered and wouldn't count against their smaller total. Now, the three biggest carriers, who are also the three fastest growing carriers, have suddenly drawn a floor under wireless prices. T-Mobile and Verizon both have the floor set at $50. AT&T's floor is technically set at $45, but only with a microscopic 300MB plan. To match T-Mobile's 2GB opening offer will cost an AT&T subscriber $55. Unlimited data matches too, at $95 per line. Verizon and T-Mobile stay in lockstep the next two increments up, and so does AT&T, more or less, with a single $75 offer for 5GB. The competition has shifted away from price and towards services. Verizon continues to bank on its reputation for being America's most reliable network, and now can offer that reliability for the same price as the competition. T-Mobile, meanwhile, will at least double the data Verizon offers for the same price, and also won't count music streaming or SD video streaming against the data cap. Global roaming is free and Data Stash allows unused data at T-Mobile to be carried over to future months, though that last is again limited to those who buy a data upgrade. T-Mobile's no overage guarantee remains intact. And the gap between their two networks is narrowing, though it's still there. AT&T is somewhere in between, offering slimmed down versions of rollover data and free roaming while being almost as reliable as Verizon. T-Mobile, however, is the only one hiking prices on all its customers, not just the unlimited ones who strain the network the most. So this must be considered at least mildly positive for the Big Two. Legere and co. seem to be banking on their superior data buckets and free goodies to entice customers to pay the same or nearly same amount for a network that is not quite as good. If they are right, T-Mobile should see major improvements in net income and free cash flow. The carrier's recent earnings statement featured a number of positive indicators , including positive free cash flow and cash-positive EIP for the first time - old balances were paid down faster than new ones were accrued. And T-Mobile already had 1 million new subscribers in just the first month of the new quarter. All of this was before the price hike, however. If this shift away from Un-Carrier principles is too much for customers to stomach, the damage to growth and to the brand could set the stock back significantly. And then there is the risk that all this free streaming will impair the reliability of the network. All this leaves Sprint (NYSE: S ) as perhaps the only real price competitor left in the market. Sprint was not completely outside the new spirit of wireless peace: it recently raised the price of its own unlimited plan as well. It also recently announced that it would match T-Mobile's no overage guarantee on its family plan, a further convergence. But then it cut the price for a 1GB line to $40, and its unlimited price hike was only $10, meaning that it is now $25 below the new consensus price of the Big Two/Three. Then it went and took a shot at T-Mobile by including them in their newly resurrected Half-off promotion. Sprint appears to be somewhat conflicted about its future direction at the moment, making smaller price hikes than its rivals but not willing to simply hold the line at the old price points as it cautiously probes how much its customers will tolerate before jumping ship, fearful to upset them even though it is now the undisputed price leader. A lot may depend on where Sprint goes from here. Parent company SoftBank ( OTCPK:SFTBY ) can't be happy with the continued red ink coming out of its American subsidiary. If the other carriers are all content to price at $50 for an introductory offer and $95 for unlimited, perhaps the word will come down that that is where Sprint should be as well. But SoftBank has a reputation for being willing to fight on price. At the last earnings call, CEO Marcelo Claure said that the recent unlimited hike to $70 had had no discernible impact on churn or growth, suggesting that most of Sprint's subscribers know that they're getting the best offer available. So maybe there is room now to shrink red ink and keep the price lead. If Sprint, whose network is also showing marked improvement, is allowed to tough it out in its current position, it may be able to lure Big Three subscribers as sticker shock from the recent round of price hikes sets in, especially T-Mobile subscribers who are more likely to have joined for the low prices. That in turn might prompt Legere to reignite the price war. The new paradigm in wireless is very interesting, but depending upon whether Sprint chooses to obey the peace terms or not, it might not last. T-Mobile in particular is making a substantial change in how it prices itself relative to the other carriers, and after so long as the price leader, it is not clear how its subscribers will react to that. Low-quality video streams may not be enough to hold them when Sprint's own unlimited plan is high quality and cheaper. Three weeks ago, I recommended selling T-Mobile stock if its announced video plan did not include a component to time-shift data demands. The stock is down about 8% since I made that recommendation, but I still don't call it a buy. At the end of the day, I simply am not confident its network can hold up under all this free streaming, nor do I believe it yet has enough pricing power to force its customers to accept these higher prices. Verizon retains its position as the high-quality network and the new pricing plan should be mildly accretive to margins and revenues. Sprint meanwhile, is the high-risk, high-reward trade. If it can stay alive long enough to fully deploy its high-band spectrum, it could take a commanding lead in the market as the new market disruptor, but only if it doesn't bleed to death first. But the new pricing paradigm and room to raise rates without sacrificing price leadership should help with that. I would take profits on any T-Mobile holdings (still up almost 50% since last December) and hold any Verizon stock. A Sprint investment also gets my endorsement. It is a risk, but a relatively small one relative to the potential reward if the new higher prices give it the breathing room it needs to execute its vision. I recommend Sprint and Verizon over T-Mobile and AT&T. Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
