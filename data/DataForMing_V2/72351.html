Apple: May Has Come And Gone And No $140; Where We Stand - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha The month of May has come and gone and shares of Apple never made it to $140 as I predicted. Am I disappointed? You bet I am. But don't confuse 'disappointment' with anger or even an apology. It seems the only ones making money during this tight pattern are the traders. Still, with the WWDC now just one week away, AAPL stock is back in play for a short squeeze. And $140 remains the target. The month of May has come and gone and shares of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) never made it to $140 as I predicted it would - not once , not twice , but on three occasions . In fact, the closest AAPL stock got to even sniffing my $140 target was when shares reached an intraday high of $132.97 on May 22, falling 5.28% short of my target. AAPL stock closed Friday at $130.28, down 1.14%. Although the shares are still up 18% on the year, the stock ended down for the week by 1.7%. And that's even with several positive rumors swirling. It was clear that $133 is now the area of resistance the for the shares. How can I be so sure? Well, the $133 level was tested twice just this week. First on May 22, reaching $132.97 and the very next day the stock reached $132.91, just before selling off with the rest of the market. AAPL stock appears to be consolidating. The good news is, while $133 is the area of resistance, $130 also seems to offer tremendous support. Accordingly, it seems the only ones making money during this tight pattern are the traders. At minimum, I expected AAPL stock to break $135 two weeks ago, well on its way to $140 by close of market this past Friday. Obviously the market had other ideas. Am I disappointed? You bet I am. But don't confuse 'disappointment' with anger or even an apology. I bought a new lot at $124.11 and I'm already up 5% on this position. Do I value my credibility? Of course. But not as much as I value making money. Look, I'm long AAPL shares and have been a shareholder for more than five years. As we've discussed throughout this experience, I'm also an active trader - never really subscribed to the idea that buy-and-hold was the only worthwhile strategy. If it works for you, great. Keep keeping on. But this a not a "one-size fits all" stock market. Don't presume to know that my goal (or anyone else's) should be the same as yours. Keep that in mind and we'll get along just fine. At the same time, I hold a core position in AAPL - one that is focused solely on Apple's fundamentals and the pace of the company's improvements and growth. This core position I plan to hold until the shares reach - at least - $200. And that's something I expect to happen in the next 12 to 18 months. And since I'm in the business of making predictions, so be it. What's more important to focus on is the direction of Apple, which I think will go higher over time. In that vein, I put my money where my mouth is and I don't mind putting my record on the line for anyone to scrutinize - hence the $140 prediction. It's not a matter of "if," it's a matter of when. And since you like predictions, try this on for size: the shorts that piled into AAPL stock recently will eventually get what's coming to them. The short position on AAPL stock spiked 26% in the two-week period that ended May 15. It seems the short sellers are betting that Apple's best days are behind it, especially with the stock still resting at near all-time highs. But why bet against a company with $195 billion in cash that just raised its buyback authorization? Will AAPL allow its stock to fall below its fair market value? The shorts are either dumb or stupid. Take your pick. Either way, with the WWDC now just one week away, AAPL stock is back in play for a short squeeze. And $140 remains the target. There, I said it.
