Windows 10 Will Come Pre-Loaded With Candy Crush Saga Because That Is The World We Live In Now â€“ Consumerist Get your best “back in my day” grumble face on: Solitaire and Minesweeper might’ve been good enough procrastination tools in times past, but Microsoft is getting hip to the times, and will pre-load Candy Crush Saga into its upcoming Windows 10. Anyone who’s looked up from their smartphone long enough on the bus, train or park bench knows that the addictive candy popping and dropping game from mobile game company King is the distraction of choice, and Microsoft says it’s definitely noticed. Noting that Windows Phone users have been able to play Candy Crush since it came to that platform in December, Microsoft writes on Xbox Wire : “As an added bonus, Candy Crush Saga will automatically be installed for customers that upgrade to or download Windows 10 for periods of time following the game launch. It will even include cross-play options for your iOS and Android devices.” And for those still firmly in the solitaire camp — you know, the kind of game you play that doesn’t intone “Taaaasty!” when you forget to turn the volume off — Microsoft r ecently announced it’s bringing Solitaire back for Windows 10 after leaving it off with Windows 8. Something for everyone, I suppose.
