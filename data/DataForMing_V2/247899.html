My Black Friday Specials | Seeking Alpha It is time to return to my old methods based on Warren Buffett, which have worked for me since 2003. My returns should improve from this point on. Using tools from Portfolio123 and Excel, I was able to find 23 companies that have a strong 10-year history and are unfairly valued. I predict these companies will double in 5 years. In the spirit of Black Friday, I decided to do my own bargain hunting and reallocate my portfolio. It's been a tough year for me given my affinity for commodity stocks. Commodities did not perform well, but that doesn't keep me from returning to basics to find good values. It was time to tear down my portfolio, and go back to my tried and true method of looking for undervalued companies that have a history of growing earnings and revenues. First, I had to find the right bargain bin in which to search. Using the Portfolio123 stock screener, I limited my universe using the following criteria: Positive free cash flow - Does the company have money left over after paying for capital expenditures? Adequate Daily Dollar Volume greater than $4 million - Is the stock actively traded? Increasing earnings each of the last 10 years OR positive earnings growth for the last 10-, 5-, 3-, and 1-year periods - Is the company growing the bottom line? Increasing revenues each of the last 10 years OR positive revenue growth for the last 10-, 5-, 3-, and 1-year periods - Is the company growing the top line? Average (five years) Return on Equity greater than 15% OR Average (five years) Return on Investment greater than 12% - Does the company have pricing control? If this looks a little like a page from Warren Buffett's playbook, it is, if one uses elements from Mary Buffett's writings. I am not ashamed to steal someone else's ideas if they work. Now, that I've found the right bargain bin, it's time to do some dumpster diving, and determine which companies are unfairly undervalued. I downloaded the data to Excel, and determined an unfair price where I can feel comfortable earning at least 15% annually on each investment. I made sure the downloaded data included Beta (5-year), EPS, EPS Growth (5-year), Sales Per Share, Sales Growth (5-year), Net Margin (5-year), Book Value Per Share, ROE (5-year), Payout Ratio (5-year), Current P/E, Low P/E (5-year) and High P/E (5-year). With that, I built formulas to determine future earnings for each of the next five years. Three different methods were utilized depending on whether I used earnings growth, sales growth, or equity growth. To be conservative, I chose the lowest earnings projection to determine a future value. From there, I used the payout ratio to determine potential dividend payments for the next five years. A real challenge, though, is how to determine a future price for each equity. Which multiplier should one use? I used the lower of either the current P/E ratio, or the geometric mean of the Low and High P/E ratios to calculate a future price. Using the Net Present Value function and the Internal Rate of Return function, I filtered for companies that had a positive NPV and a minimum IRR of 15%. The 15% IRR is necessary if I want to have confidence that the stock price will double in five years. On average, I used a discount rate of 8.93% to determine the NPV. For a particular company, that could fluctuate based on its historical Beta. The highest discount rate used for this group was 10.74% for Cognizant. While average P/E ratio is 14.20, it is best to use the more conservative current ratio of 12.92 as a multiplier. That gives Apple a $422 price target in five years. With an 8.5% required rate of return and the future dividends, that calculates Apple's net present value at $162. That means Apple is undervalued. Conservatively, that gives one an internal rate of return of 31%. These are the numbers to support my thesis about Apple I don't believe in predicting the future. I honestly believe that anyone who tries to predict economic or market trends is just guessing. In the case of a company like Apple, who knows what will be the new hot technology? We do know, however, that Apple has a ten-year history of getting it right. All I can do is look at the market universe, and try to find companies that have been executing, and determine whether they're undervalued or not. These eight companies have grown earnings, increased sales, and are sitting in the discount aisle. Buy them now. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
