Disney: Once Again, Star Wars And Media Segment Demise Are Overblown - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Star Wars is not going to have the illusionary impact most think. I show how Star Wars needs to be taken into context of the entire business. Disney's media networks is not in shambles as some professional analysts believe. There are two factors I believe are interrelated and hurting Disney's (NYSE: DIS ) performance. One is the belief that Star Wars will bring in bountiful revenue. The other is that the media networks segment will continue to decline. I will start with Star Wars, then tackle the latter. Yes, the new Star Wars movie is a hit. Also, I am one of the few who does not care for it. Confusing a hit franchise for a good stock is a common trait among investors. I remember how every single analyst was bullish about this space alien movie. Here is the cold truth, Star Wars will, at best, marginally aid the segment. You cannot tell me that this is the only thing Disney has going for it. This is the 2015 breakdown, although the breakdown has been pretty consistent for the past five years. According to Business Insider , the most optimistic estimate is from Entertainment Weekly who predicts $3 billion in sales globally. As we know revenues do not remain constant. So I took an average of the 5-year revenue growth to project 2016 revenues, which is approximately 8%. So, I will assume that revenues grow from $52.4 billion to $56.7 billion. Even with a conservative growth estimate, the Star Wars movie has a 5% impact. Assuming this comes true, then I could say that the movie may have an impact. However, I would like to throw a wrench into this analysis. Did you know Star Wars will not be Disney's highest grossing movie? Domestically, the following Disney classics grossed close to $3 billion with Snow White hitting the $6.7 billion mark. With historical numbers such as these, it is tough to justify the impact of the Star Wars movie given the fact that Disney has experienced these numbers before in their respective time periods. These numbers do not include the international numbers that are built into Star Wars projections. Merchandise is another segment many believe Star Wars will have an impact on. There already is an impact as stated in the 2015 10-k : The 14% increase in licensing and publishing revenues was driven by a 13% increase from our merchandise licensing business due to the performance of merchandise based on Frozen, Avengers and Star Wars classic ... When I researched past 10-ks, it appears that hit movies in turn drive merchandise sales for the consumer products segment. I agree there will be an impact. However, it is not going to be as big as most think if Disney's Frozen is any indication. Merchandising falls within the licensing and publishing segment within the consumer products segment. In 2015, revenues from licensing and publishing were $2.88 billion which spanned from Frozen, Avengers, and Star Wars. Three franchises grossed that amount. In 2014 , Frozen, Disney Channel, Mickey and Minnie, and Spiderman grossed $2.53 billion. Despite Disney's Frozen being a hit movie it was not the sole driver of merchandise sales. While the news of ESPN subscriber growth decline is fresh, the slow down in growth of the media network segment is not new. For past 5 years , the rate of growth has been slowing for the media network segment while the rate of growth has been increasing for the parks and resorts segment. Starting from a one-year growth rate and extending it out year-by-year, you can clearly see the slow growth and how it lags behind the parks and resort segment, Disney's second largest segment. It could be an indication that the media networks segment may be hurting. If that is the case, let's go one step further. Let's assume the worst case scenario where the media network segment becomes worthless. (Unlikely, but you will see where I am going with this.) The largest segment then becomes the parks and resorts segment which allows me to compare the company against other theme park stocks. I will compare Disney with Six Flags (NYSE: SIX ) and Cedar Fair (NYSE: FUN ) using its current market cap and revenue and earnings data without the media networks segment. (Note, since Disney is the only company with a 2015 10-k, I used the 2014 numbers in order to keep consistency.) The P/E ratio echoes a similar sentiment. This is to be expected since the market cap includes the media and network segment. If I adjust the market caps to assume that the media network segments never existed, the valuations become more realistic. I will adjust the market cap downward by the average composition of media networks percentage contribution of the revenue stream. On a P/S basis Disney appears to be fairly valued. On a P/E basis Disney appears to be undervalued relative to its peers. Now here is the twist. Disney's market cap had to be nearly halved to achieve those numbers. That is because media networks constituted approximately 45% of total revenues and have been relatively stable. The stock is currently trading around the $107 level. Removing 45% of the stocks value suggests that the stock should trade around the $59 level. How likely is this situation to happen? It is very unlikely and shows how the media network slow down has been blown out of proportion. This is also where Star Wars comes into picture. Investors appear emotionally attached to the media network segment and are looking for something else to fill that void, which is Star Wars. This is a huge blunder. To invest in Disney because of a single franchise is just hope. Even if Disney did not buy the franchise, nothing negative would have really happened to the company. Star Wars is nothing more than a diversification play. Theme parks operate on simple principles. An excerpt from CNN Money concerning Cedar Fair states the following: These new rides cost a fair amount of money to build. But Ouimet said that Cedar Fair has been able to raise ticket prices at all its parks pretty consistently over the past few years to help offset those expenses. This last quote should sound familiar because it is echoed in Disney's 10-k : Increased guest spending was primarily due to higher average ticket prices for admissions at our theme parks and for sailings at our cruise line, increased food, beverage and merchandise spending and higher average hotel room rates. Though attendance volumes may fluctuate every year, Disney and these theme park companies have the power to increase revenue because they control prices in the form of price increases. Thus, innovation and price increases are what drive theme park revenues. Star Wars may aid Disney in this aspect, but it will not be the main reason to own the stock or solely drive revenues as I have previously stated. Bottom line is to actually do your own research rather than getting emotional about a company's future. Both the media network segment decline and Star Wars impact have been massively overblown.
