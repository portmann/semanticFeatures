Apple: The Crying Need To Shorten The iOS Replacement Cycle - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple provides broad backward compatibility for iOS, but this probably lengthens the upgrade cycle for iOS devices. Broad iOS compatibility also limits Apple's ability to leverage its custom processor performance, as well as negatively impacts reliability on supported devices. At Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) recent March event , the company touted the 80% installation rate of its latest version of iOS (9) on compatible devices. While this is commendably high compared to Android, the strategy of providing broad backward compatibility has probably backfired by slowing iOS device replacements. Apple clearly needs to accelerate device replacements in order to stimulate sales. At the upcoming World Wide Developer Conference (WWDC), we may see a change in the current policy. It wouldn't be WWDC without at least one unflattering comparison between iOS device adoption and Google's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Android. Android Marshmallow (6.0) adoption stands at just 7.5%, while by far the largest fragment of usage goes to KitKat (4.4) at 32.5%. Undoubtedly, Apple will extol the benefits of its lack of "fragmentation." But developers know that the lack of fragmentation is more apparent than real. iOS developers are told to test their apps on all compatible devices for the iOS version supported by the app. Why? Because each device generation is significantly different, especially in its system on chip (SOC), and each device receives a version of iOS specifically tailored for it. iOS isn't quite the monolith Apple would have the world believe. Each iOS generation is itself "fragmented" to a greater or lesser extent by the need for device tailoring. When iOS 9 was rolled out at WWDC in 2015, it was made backwardly compatible with iPad 2 and iPhone 4s, both introduced in 2011. Backward compatibility has been a mixed bag to say the least. As a developer, I'm forced to keep the old devices around for testing. iOS 9.3 works surprisingly well on iPad 2 and iPhone 4s, yet it's total crap on the 3rd gen iPad, the first with retina display. iOS 9 works best on any of the later devices using Apple's 64 bit SOCs (A7 and later for iPad Air etc.) In addition to device tailoring, Apple introduced essentially three tiers of the iOS 9 at WWDC. The top tier, which runs only on iPads using the A8X (iPad Air 2) and A9X (iPad Pros), features full split screen multitasking. A lower tier features some multitasking capability but not split screen, and runs on the iPads using the A7 SOC. Finally, there is the tier of pre-64 bit SOC devices that don't have any iOS multitasking functions, as well as all iPhones, even the newest A6s. For the sake of ensuring broad device compatibility, Apple has created its own form of fragmentation. Certainly, the problem isn't as severe as in the Android world, but it has had negative consequences. I believe that one of the more serious consequences has been the relatively slow sales of the iPhone 6s. Obviously, there have been a number of factors bearing on iPhone sales this year, but I'd like to focus on a key area, which I think should be an ongoing concern. I often encounter statements by analysts that the processor upgrade of the 6s was "incremental." This is complete nonsense. By virtue of design improvements as well as moving to the 14-16 nm FinFET processes of the Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) and TSMC (NYSE: TSM ) foundries, Apple was able to achieve impressive performance gains of 70% in CPU performance, and 90% in GPU performance over the previous generation. But there is a grain of truth in the description of the upgrade as "incremental." The performance gains were not that apparent to the user. There were no killer features that relied on the higher performance of the processor. Apple could have implemented multitasking on the 6s generation (some features on the 6s, all of them, including split screen multitasking on the 6s Plus), but chose not to. In effect, the 6s was burdened by a dumbed down version of iOS that didn't fully leverage the advantages of Apple's processor leadership. The need to provide broad platform compatibility probably entails some degree of dumbing down, even for iPad Pros that use the top tier multitasking version of iOS. This is simply due to the need for economy of scale. The OS developer has to ensure that there is a large body of OS code that is common to all devices, or else economy of scale is lost. So there are a number of problems associated with the broad compatibility that Apple provides with iOS. Apple doesn't fully exploit the processing advantages of its latest generation devices. Broad compatibility also means that the body of common code in the OS is reduced, reducing the benefits of economy of scale. The OS tailoring required for each device is simply added expense. Users are also seeing issues with reliability and performance that crop up when a new version of iOS is introduced. In the case of my own experience with iOS 9 on the 3rd gen iPad, the problems have never been resolved, now almost a year after I installed the first developer beta. Clearly, Apple is straining to create a broadly compatible iOS, to the detriment of user experience, and not merely for older devices. The most important disadvantage of broad compatibility is that it simply disincentivizes upgrading. If one can run the latest iOS version with no apparent performance detriment, why bother with a hardware upgrade? Despite the fact that long replacement cycle has been often pointed to as a contributor to the iPad sales decline, Apple maintains compatibility as far back as the iPad 2 from 2011. The obvious conclusion is that Apple needs to scale back device compatibility to shorten the replacement cycle for iOS devices, as well as provide a better user experience for the devices that are supported. Almost certainly, this year's WWDC will see at least one of the above issues addressed. The next generation of iOS will support multitasking features on iPhone. Why am I so certain? Because Android N is coming . Android N will support split screen multitasking. Android is still predominantly a smartphone operating system, so it's reasonable to expect that the multitasking features will be available on latest generation Android phones. But Apple needs to do more than implement multitasking on iPhone. It needs to rethink its whole compatibility strategy. At this point, iOS should only be supporting 64 bit devices, which means nothing older than the iPhone 5s and iPad Air. Investors should be alert to the device compatibility Apple announces for the next generation iOS (10) at WWDC. The iPad 2 and iPhone 4s can be expected to drop off the list, at the very least, but Apple needs to go much further. If it fails to do so, I would definitely be concerned for the sales potential of the upcoming iPhone 7. I remain a concerned Apple long. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
