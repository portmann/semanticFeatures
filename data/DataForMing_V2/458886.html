Sequans Communications: A Comeback In The Making - Sequans Communications (NYSE:SQNS) | Seeking Alpha 2011 shifts in WiMAX technology put Sequans Communications in a tough competitive position. Sequans quickly modernized their product portfolio to focus on key growth prospects. The new product applications are well positioned for industry growth, while Sequans forges key certifications and partnerships. When it went public in 2010, Sequans Communications (NYSE: SQNS ) was a blossoming chip producer positioned heavily in WiMAX hardware. WiMAX is a high-speed wireless broadband service similar to Wi-Fi, but it can accommodate a broader traffic flow. At the time, it appeared that some cities were looking at implementing this service for residents. President Obama even traveled to Marquette, MI, in February 2011 to speak about the impact WiMAX had on local business and university distance learning. It looked as though WiMAX would soon be the dominant technology. However, Long Term Evolution also was emerging as a competitive standard for wireless connectivity. Sprint (NYE: S ) had already invested in a WiMAX network, while AT&T (NYSE: T ) and Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) both committed to LTE networks. LTE is said to have benefits over WiMAX, including more bandwidth, reduced latency and easier integration into existing cell frequencies. At the time, Sprint's strategy began evolving to focus on adding the iPhone to its network. In part because of these reasons, Sprint began planning their own LTE network investment with LightSquared , marking the beginning of the end for WiMAX in the U.S. At the close of 2012, Sequans recorded $22.3 million in sales, marking a 77% decline from the previous year. Q4 of that year contributed a dismal $3.1 million in revenue and 9.4% gross margin. Sequans went through an overwhelming decrease in stock value while trailing industry peers in technology, breadth of line and financial strength. They would likely sit on aging inventory while their product strategy remained nebulous. If this company were to return confidence to their shareholders, it would require a significant shift in focus. Fast forward to the present day and the company has a well-defined product strategy, targeting growth in an expanding 4G LTE network. CEO Georges Karam focused on a niche strategy within IoT and M2M devices, while most industry peers went after the larger mobile device market. Their product range is small by comparison, but this strategy has created an exclusive offer that is positioned to prevail. The Internet of Things (IoT) is disrupting the world, paving the way for smart cities and connected consumer devices. There is a tremendous profit opportunity in the entire supply chain of IoT. Research predicts that worldwide IoT chip revenue will reach $10.78 billion by 2022 (Research and Markets, 2016). That's all great in theory, but with industry peers chasing this same opportunity, why should we count on Sequans to win market share? Peers like Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO ) do have IoT focus, but their portfolio is more concentrated on short-range Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connected devices rather than LTE optimization at this time. Broadcom also has an advantage of offering bundled hardware solutions to their customers, but they still cannot offer a comparable product solution to Sequans. Larger peers also need to divide resources across managing robust SKU portfolios, which can strain employee focus and form bottlenecks in operations. Comparably, Sequans may be more agile, allowing their leadership team to focus purely on 4G LTE profit contribution. If you're not convinced that Sequans can compete, let's look at product performance. In 2015, Sequans took home an "IoT Innovation Award" from Connected World Magazine for their CAT 1 trials with Verizon and Ericcson. No more than a year later they were honored with "Most Innovative IoT/M2M Strategy" by Leading Lights for their new CAT M technology. Sequans has three IoT platforms under the names Monarch, Calliope and Colibri. These provide CAT M, CAT 1, and CAT 4 classes, respectively. CAT M and CAT 1 are the only ones of their kind in the market, providing low cost and power consumption solutions for devices that require smaller data transfers (e.g., utility meters, asset trackers, and health sensors). On the other hand, the Colibri platform can support more robust connections required for tablets, routers and PCs. There are still more proprietary benefits, including CAT M's dynamic power management technology, which uses less power (saving you battery life) while also promising up to 15 years of operation (helping reduce warranty claims for manufacturers). Finally, Sequans introduced Sequans AIR in their CAT4 chip, which is an active interference rejection technology. As our LTE networks get more and more crowded, service providers need to find solutions to support higher traffic. Sequans AIR allows service providers to handle twice the network capacity and provides a throughput increase of three and a half times, which will allow companies like Verizon to offer better service to their consumers. Sequans CAT 1 and CAT 4 chips support Voice over LTE (VoLTE). Sequans is the first to bring VoLTE capability to a CAT 1 chip and the first to have it certified by Verizon. Compared to a traditional voice connection, VoLTE is said to provide a better quality sound and a more stable connection. However, where I see its largest opportunity is within IoT rather than traditional cellular applications. The verbal command creates an opportunity to enhance multi-tasking and replace some uses of touch screens. An example of this is for wearable health trackers, which may have compact screens that are difficult to navigate by touch. Peers like Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) also can provide VoLTE, but the unique positioning for Sequans is the low-cost and low-power CAT 1 product. Low-cost components help device manufacturers reduce COGS, expanding gross profit margin and also reducing consumer barrier to entry at more affordable retails. Sequans supplies chips for more robust devices as well, including modems and routers for residential and industrial applications. Their design wins extend to major names such as D-Link and Netgear. Verizon's JetPack produced in partnership with NETGEAR is a 4G LTE hot spot. Verizon is a great partner for Sequans as they can invest heavily in partnered product marketing support. In addition, Verizon's Q1 earnings presentation shows a steady growth in 4G LTE devices. Though most of these are phones, this growth rate is encouraging for the platform as a whole. Sequans also has potential to support Reliance Jio in India, though it is not currently in the forecast. Reliance is planning on rolling out their network in late 2016 to their 30,000,000 subscribers, and is testing on 500,000 subscribers this year. As a basis for population with disposable income it may be fair to compare to the middle class population in India estimated at 50,000,0000. According to Ernst & Young , that same middle class is predicted to reach an incredible 200,000,000 in just five years. Partnerships are forged on a few different levels and typically require collaboration for a successful launch. Network service providers are the key to Sequans' distribution success. A component would never be considered by an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) unless it earned validation for the end network. Therefore, it is important that both CAT 1 and CAT 4 chipsets have been validated by Verizon and AT&T. Sequans can now open up more opportunities with major consumer devices selling through these network providers. Sequans is additionally working to certify their CAT 1 chip with Telstra, which would open up their distribution to Australian networks. Other important partnerships forming include LTE for Thales aviation and a new partnership with Socle Technologies. Socle is a subsidiary of Foxconn, which I find very intriguing. Based on Foxconn's relationships with global technology manufacturers, this could be a great opportunity for Sequans' expansion. At the close of 2015, Sequans grew revenue to $32.7 million , a 45% increase over 2014. This is still a far cry from 2011's $93.7 million. To date, Sequans is not a profitable company, but they are effectively closing the gap in their operating loss. For example, their 2015 annual operating loss of $23.6 million compares favorably to a loss of $34 million in 2014. Q1 2016 also suggests that this trend may continue. In 2016, Sequans lost just $5.2 million, while in the first quarter of 2015 that number was $8.2 million. The weight of this operating loss to revenue also is improving due to an increase in design wins. Investors should be aware that the company has been in a tight cash position though, burning through 46% of their cash in the past two quarters. Because of this, they've recently issued an additional $7 million in convertible debt. Where Sequans has substantial pressure is on their gross margin contribution, which has struggled for years. Luckily, the company reached 40% gross margins at the close of 2015, a 33% increase over the previous year. In addition, Q1 2016 margins were 47.5%, which may indicate Sequans is returning to parity within the industry. Even with this accomplishment, peers like Qualcomm have heftier gross margins of 59% . Qualcomm also provides a stable 4% yield, helping cover any short-term volatility in the market. The point is that there are different investment strategies depending on if you are seeking value or speculative growth. Investors may look past these short-term issues if they are seeking a speculative growth addition to their portfolio. According to Yahoo Finance, six analysts have an average price target of $3.50 per share, while it currently resides around $2.21 per share. Sequans met a horrible fate while the market landscape evolved but adapted during this inflection point. Their product portfolio today is relatively small but unique in performance and exclusive for market applications in the short term. The company must continue to innovate their product portfolio in order to maintain shareholder confidence since industry peers can invest heavily in new product development. The company also needs to prove they can return to 55% or greater gross margins like their counterparts. Finally, they need to turn an operating profit and manage their cash positions more conservatively. Overall, their product portfolio today is one that meets a niche market need for low-cost and low-power chips. The booming IoT category will create enough opportunity for the majority of competitors to succeed. Though I'm confident in the payoff for design wins over the next three to five years, I'm not yet convinced Sequans can maintain proprietary advantages beyond the five-year mark. In the end, Sequans' growth in revenue, reduction in operating loss, certifications and proprietary product features are indicators of a hidden growth opportunity overshadowed by its peers.
