Why Investors Should Second-Guess Apple - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha When I review the comments section of my previous article on Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) I find exactly what I expect. There's one of the things that makes Seeking Alpha great: excellent reader insight. And, as is the case with battleground stocks such as AAPL, there's a dismissive defensiveness. A prevailing sentiment that even a slightly critical perspective is little more than clickbait to be cast off without consideration. Standard psychological principles explain why we see that reaction. And, to some extent, it's probably a good response for long-term investors to have. It helps you keep not just pure noise, but concerns that, although real, probably will not impact a buy-and-hold investment in perspective. For example, one of Seeking Alpha's most prolific writers on Apple (and technology ), Mark Hibben, recently noted : Based on the guidance, I can't in good faith recommend Apple as a Buy anymore. That may change, based on how things sort out in the December quarter, but for now, Apple has become a Hold. As an investor, I took that to mean now is probably not the best time to initiate or add to a position in AAPL. However I didn't take it to mean that Hibben is an idiot who hates Apple. I'm rational like that. Another Seeking Alpha contributor, Damon Verial, came to a similar conclusion using a completely different approach . But setting aside the veracity of Hibben and Verial's near-term calls, both scored high on the criteria editors at Seeking Alpha use to evaluate and ultimately decide on articles. (For the record, as my masthead states, I'm a full-time technology editor at SA). Let's pull the curtain back and detail a couple of these points because I think it can be instructive for readers/investors. That's really the key. And it speaks to the title of this article. Anybody can preach to the Apple choir. At the same time, anybody can misguidedly trash Apple and elicit a response. And while I'll be the first to admit that my work sits firmly on the provocative, if not relatively outrageous side, I explore statements such as If Steve Jobs Were Alive, He Would Fire Tim Cook because I firmly believe well-thought out and honest arguments on the extreme help make us better investors. They can be bearish or bullish, but ultimately they make us think and, maybe most importantly, help us find perspective and the all-important middle ground. That's one thing Hibben accomplished in the above-linked article. He dared to consider AAPL a hold. But he has a solid reasoning behind his decision and he succeeded with respect to question number two. I'm often criticized for being bearish one day, bullish the next. But, in reality, when I write I'm merely relaying to readers the conversations I have with myself on subjects that interest me. As I see it, you don't evolve in your thinking if you ride the mainline. You have to alternate between operating on the fringes and reining yourself back in from time to time. Not all writers - or humans - will approach life (or investing) this way, but I attempt to add value in that way. Come January, Hibben might call AAPL a buy again. That doesn't make him a flip-flopper. It just makes him somebody whose perspective changed with a tide he thought long and hard about. If he ignored his reaction to the ebb and flow and, against his better judgment, kept calling AAPL a buy he would not have been adding as much value to the Seeking Alpha community as he does. The best articles on Seeking Alpha showcase authors who take their own personality style (e.g., extremist, voice of reason) and components of it (e.g., quantitative, emotional, cerebral) and inject that personality into their articles. This process produces the best, most diverse (as the examples I use in this article aptly illustrate) analysis and kickstarts the conversation that often unfolds in the comments section. More often than not that conversation helps achieve the goal we focus on in question number one. Without second-guessing, you have none of this. Hibben second-guesses refusing to worry about what some call Apple's tepid guidance. Verial second-guesses the notion of long-term investing as a strictly buy-and-hold proposition. And I second-guess a decision Apple made in a space I think I know relatively well. To that end, you don't second-guess Tim Cook because you think you're smarter than him or to show off how much you know. You second-guess Tim Cook because entertaining the possibility that Apple Music symbolizes a loss of focus can help you reconsider where you stand on AAPL as a long-term investment. You might end up right back where you started, but over time, you're better off for having gone through the intellectual exercise of second-guessing. Maybe it doesn't matter to you if Apple Music succeeds or fails. Maybe you view the decision to go all-in with streaming music, rumors of a streaming video service and Apple's reported interest in developing an electric car in isolation from the whole that determines Apple's long-term fate. That's perfectly reasonable. However I argue that you can't have it both ways. You can't call Apple the best company in the world and, as such, the best stock to own on the basis of its ecosystem if you don't critically consider the way it chooses to handle the individual components that meld that ecosystem. I decided to start writing again not because I like the spotlight (believe it or not I hate it and it makes me anxious and uncomfortable), but because I have been working in the technology trenches at Seeking Alpha for more than a year now. I see most every article that comes through on Apple and other tech stocks. I review quite a few of them. And through this process, I have the advantage of being able to think about and develop angles on relatively under-covered areas. I see few people on or off Seeking Alpha asking whether or not Apple really needs to own and operate every facet of its ecosystem. But, as investors, we need to at least consider this theme. Apple is the undisputed champ with respect to designing, (let's just say) building, marketing and selling hardware. On the software side, it produces the best operating systems. But beyond that, there have been hits and misses. And that's where the healthy second-guessing comes in. Just as it doesn't make sense to go after the low-end of the market with, using Tim Cook's word, "crappy" mobile devices, does it make sense to leave other markets, such as streaming music, to others? Today I answer that question with a resounding yes. Ride the success of Pandora (NYSE: P ) and Spotify as go-to apps on the iPhone. However, as the situation develops, I might entertain and quite possibly take ownership of a completely different conclusion. It's that process that makes doing this day in and day out rewarding and exciting. And it helps make me a better investor.
