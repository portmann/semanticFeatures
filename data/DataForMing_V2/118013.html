The Impact Of Apple's Share Buyback Program - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple's share buyback program is estimated to increase the share price by 13%. A PE ratio of 15 and 13% increase from the buyback may result in a share price of $165. The stock price of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is estimated by using the currently published share buyback program and assuming a constant market value. Considering that the share price may hit $142 in March 2017, up by 13% from the current price of $126. By additionally assuming a PE of 15 the price may hit $165. Currently Apple is in a blackout period that lasts until the day after it announces its earnings on July 21. Thus, the company is not allowed to buy back stock. The black out period is five weeks before every earnings announcement. Apple share price broke down from the narrow trading range it had been trading in this quarter and hit the 200-day moving average ($119) before pulling back. The Apple share price is shown in the figure below (source: Etrade , line shows 200-day moving average). Also seen in the graphic is that the volume has increased substantially. This behavior has been seen before, as recently as last November (figure below, source: Etrade , upper line is 50-day and lower 200-day moving averages). Then the stock was trading in the range of $95 to $105 until slowing down and then moving up to a higher trading range of $120 to $105. Then it broke down twice in the blackout period in January before a record sales of iPhone were reported and the stock moved into the current trading range of $130 to $125. One may assume that the stock is showing the same behavior now after breaking down from the current trading range and testing the 200-day moving average before it moves up to a higher trading range, where $130 would be the lower level. If Apple posts good numbers next week then this is a likely scenario, but bad numbers might keep the stock in the current trading range. Note, analysts expect good numbers this quarter as iPhone sales have remained unusually strong (see SocGen upgrades Apple, hike FQ3 iPhone estimates ). The forecasted EPS for Apple is $9.04 and $9.72 for current fiscal year and 2016, respectively. Historically Apple's stock price has traded in the PE ratio range of 11 to 16 for the trailing 12 months (figure below, Etrade), except for the period in 2013 when it dropped below 10 as a result of a reduction in iPhone sales. The stock price next year for a PE ratio of 11 to 16 may be $108 to $156, respectively. If we look only at the recent narrow range of 14 to 16, the price range may be $136 to $156. For comparison Google (NASDAQ: GOOG )(NASDAQ: GOOGL ) has a PE of 25, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) has a PE of 18, Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) a PE of 15, Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ ) a PE of 12 and Samsung Electronics ( OTC:SSNLF ) a PE of 9. The current growth in sales is 40% compared with 2014 sales. This is mainly due to increased market share and a record number of Android users switching over to iPhone according to Tim Cook ( Apple earnings call ). The iPhone has been very strong in China (22% market share in May 2015 ) despite many cheap but good Android phones available there. Another interesting fact is that Apple had 25% market share for people earning $320 to $650 (RMB 2,000 to 4,000 per month, iPhone 6 Plus sells for RMB 6,088), thus there is no indication that although car sales are contracting that people will buy cheaper phones. Currently about 16% of Apple's revenue comes from China and thus the impact would be small on total sales. China car sales peaked in January this year and have been trending down since or about 27% in May (see figure below, source: Statista ). According to recent rumors , Huawei will produce the next Nexus Android phone. It's the first time that Google picked a Chinese manufacturer and indicates that Google also is focusing on the Chinese market. But Huawei phones are competing with Xiaomi, Lenovo and Android rather than Apple as people switch between Android phones more easily. Samsung is also rumored to be introducing the new Galaxy Note 5 in mid-August (from September) to get ahead of Apple before their introduction of iPhone 6S. This also is an indication that their new flagship Galaxy S6 has not been selling as expected. The main risks for Apple going forward are high expectations after such a strong turnaround since loosing market share to Android before the bigger iPhones went on sale and a 40% growth in earnings. Currently though expectations seem tampered and the media coverage last week was negative. Sherri Scribner, senior tech analyst at Deutsche Bank Research, who last year downgraded Apple to Hold, said that "Apple was out of surprises and trading near all time high, making it more difficult to outperform expectations." Now she says: "Apple has 40% growth this year and thus it will be hard to pick up growth next year and predicts that Apple will underperform next year" ("underperform" is the lowest grade and thus it can't be downgraded further by Deutsche Bank). Analyst mean price target is $149. The Apple Watch seems to have reduced substantially in online sales from its introduction in the US (source: Slice ), but it's not known how it is doing in other parts of the world or in direct store sales in the US. Apple initially didn't expect as much demand and the demand now is probably closer to their expectations. The iPhone sold 1.5 million units in its first two quarters and 5.5 million the first year of sales. The impact on earnings is small as the margin on the watches is negative according to Tim Cook in the last earnings call ( Apple earnings call ). Apple has decided to return some of that cash they have been hoarding by buying back the shares and thus reducing the share float. In April they announced a $200 billion buyback through March 2017. To estimate the effect on the future share price by assuming a constant market value ($730 billion diluted) the share buybacks are distributed evenly (shown in green in the figure below). Then the share price would increase from $126 to $142, or 13% as shown with the black dashed line. If we assume a PE ratio of 15 and 13% increase from share buyback the share price might be $165 in the beginning of 2017. The impact of the share buyback (calculated from Apple earnings releases ). The red columns show the decreasing shares and the green columns the cumulative share buyback (left axis). The black line shows the average share price and the dashed line the calculated share price increase due to the buyback if the market value would remain unchanged from the current price (right axis, USD). Net share settlement (new share rewards and options to employees) was only 3.6% of the cumulative total at March this year. The high increase in buyback should lower this ratio to less than 2% next year. This is quite low for Apple compared to many tech firms that lower expenses with stock issues to employees. It's doubtful that the increasing market share trend will suddenly stop in China or that the world market share will hit a ceiling (i.e. 22% which is still much lower than Android) or that there will be no new markets to penetrate (i.e. India and Africa). The biggest threat to Apple's share price are high expectations and constant worries from analysts, but none of them is hardly expecting another year of such a spectacular growth and neither am I. But it's important for every investor looking at a stock receiving this much attention to know the risks and the negatives as there is less risk of exuberant expectations and prices to develop. In light of the recent earning hikes from analysts, I wouldn't be surprised that after all Icahn would turn out to be correct and that earnings will be above $10 this fiscal year and $12 the next .
