Ford said to hire Tower as second supplier to build steel frames for F-150 - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha To screen ETFs by asset class, performance, yield and more, check out the ETF Hub. ETF Hub Aug  7 2015, 16:53 ET | About: Ford Motor Company (F) | By: Carl Surran , SA News Editor Ford (NYSE: F ) has hired Tower International (NYSE: TOWR ) as a second supplier to provide steel frames for its best-selling F-150  truck, hoping to better meet delivery demands amid a parts shortage from  its current supplier, WSJ reports. Ford is struggling to get as many F-150s on dealer lots as originally planned  because its supplier, Mexico-based Metalsa, is having trouble building enough frames to keep pace with production needs, according to the report. Meanwhile, Ford is said to be shipping frames to its factories by  truck rather than rail to get them there faster but at a higher cost. How can anyone long not wonder if the process of ramping up to meet production goals is about maintaining lower discounting.  Ford will pay more; with greater numbers in guidance for Q# and 4 we must wonder if incentives and higher production cost will really be worth it as far as impressing shareholders. For me the real question becomes "how will the new F150 and larger series going to aluminum translate to the competition of who has to discount the least?"
