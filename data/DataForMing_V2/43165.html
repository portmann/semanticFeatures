Facebook And Meerkat Need Each Other - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Facebook should acquire Meerkat or come up with its own live streaming app. I make the case why choosing to buy Meerkat makes sense. Live streaming can be a part of the "instant everything" phenomenon Jason Calacanis described on CNBC. Live video streaming has the potential to grab a huge chunk of the time people spend on social media. Live streaming puts a social media spin on produced videos like the ones you see on YouTube (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ). The fact that it is unedited makes the barriers to entry lower for users trying to create content on the service. It takes time and skill to edit videos, both of which most users don't have. It is easier to simply press a button and start filming. The video content is deleted either right away or after 24 hours depending on which app you are using. This makes it a "judgment free zone." Yes, it is the Planet Fitness of social media. A good analogy to compare YouTube and live streaming is the difference between Instagram and Snapchat. Instagram usually consists of polished photos, which are edited and touched up. They are judged by the number of likes they get and last on the internet forever unless you manually delete them. Snapchat stories only exist for 24 hours and cannot be liked. They are unedited viewpoints of your day. The instantaneous nature of the app is what differentiates it from other social media and has allowed it to amass millions of users. While there are likes given on live video streams, they are the ultimate unedited viewpoint into a person's life. Because live video streams don't have a clearly defined time limit, they allow for extended viewing times. There hasn't been much data to look into because the services are so new, but we were able to get a small glimpse into its potential in a statement given by Ben Rubin who is the founder of Meerkat. Sixteen days after the app was launched it received its 100,000th download. On this day Rubin stated more than 20% of people on Meerkat watch more than 2 hours per day, 8% watch 3 hours per day, and 4% watch 4 hours per day. These metrics may be distorted because they are still on a small scale. Early adopters may be more likely to binge on the new technology. On the other hand, it is worth noting that the amount of content on the app was limited because it had only been launched a little over two weeks prior. This makes it amazing that users were on the app this long. Whether it's Meerkat, Periscope, or some other app that hasn't been launched yet, the potential to gain an audience for a long period of time is there. Engagement is the holy grail of social media. The more you are on an app interacting with the content, the more ads will be viewed. On CNBC, there was a story, which quoted Weblogs' CEO Jason Calacanis as saying , "Meerkat is going to be bought by Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), I think, in the next six months." This is a reasonable prediction. I am going to explain why in this article. I will then look at how Facebook will be affected by having a live streaming presence whether it is Meerkat or another service. I have already explained the huge opportunity live video streaming is. This means Facebook can't afford to botch this opportunity. There is certainly a limited amount of time people spend on social media. Even if this category may have some room to grow, there is only 24 hours in a day. If people are spending an hour everyday on a streaming platform, they are on Facebook properties one hour less than they otherwise would be. The one situation Facebook botched in the past few years was Snapchat. Facebook attempted to buy it, but the offer was rejected. When Facebook attempted to make its own knockoff called Slingshot, it was unsuccessful. There may not have been much Facebook could have done to prevent Snapchat from growing in prominence, but it doesn't want to repeat the situation. Facebook could have acquired Snapchat by offering it more money or offering to buy it earlier. Secondly, it could have created a better knockoff app. The problem with the first option is maybe Snapchat wouldn't have accepted an offer from Facebook unless it substantially overpaid. The problem with the second option is Slingshot may not have been popular no matter how good it was because Snapchat already occupied and dominated the category. With live video streaming, Facebook may not be capable of creating a similar app in house without dedicating too big of an engineering team to do it. As you can see with its new video collaboration app Riff, it isn't easy to create a popular social app. The app now ranks 504th on the App Store in the social media category as you can see in the chart below . I'm not trying to say Facebook can't innovate, but if making Riff and Slingshot weren't successful and acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp were, I think it makes perfect sense for Facebook to buy Meerkat. Meerkat offers brand equity because of the media exposure it has gotten in the past month. As you can see from the Google trends data the search term "Meerkat" has gained interest since the app was launched. Anecdotally, I can say I've read many articles about Meerkat on most of the top business/tech websites. Of course, the other thing Meerkat offer Facebook is an app with a great experience. From using both apps, I can certainly see why a user would prefer the experience of Meerkat over Periscope. The problem with Meerkat is there are less people using it, which brings me to my next point. Meerkat had a fairly successful first few weeks, but after the launch of Periscope on March 27th the number of downloads has collapsed as you can see in the chart below . On March 27th, the app was 25th in the US social networking category; it is now ranked 129th. The reason why this happened is obvious. Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) doesn't need Meerkat and Meerkat needs Twitter. Meerkat is in a tough position because it has to compete with a Twitter service on Twitter. We saw this problem play out for Meerkat when after Twitter bought Periscope it cut off Meerkat's access to its social graph. The social graph allowed Meerkat users to automatically follow and be followed by their contacts on Twitter. In response to this, Meerkat created its own recommendation system. It also let users follow others within the stream and let users share a Meerkat profile on Twitter. Meerkat's downloads are clearly floundering. Integration with Facebook would bring Facebook's social graph to the platform, which would be even better than what Twitter was offering simply because Facebook has more users. Live streams need to be connected with a social media platform because users need to be instantaneously notified about the event as it is happening or else they will miss it. Periscope does have a function where users can watch the stream up to 24 hours later if they did miss it. Meerkat could duplicate this function, but judging from my own usage, watching an old stream isn't satisfying because you don't get to interact with the other users by commenting on the video. It is like watching an old conversation you weren't a part of. I am sure content creators already post about their upcoming Meerkat streams on social media such as Facebook, Snapchat, and Instagram, but users won't be notified immediately. Further integration with Facebook would be great. With Meerkat owned by Facebook it would be a role reversal because now Meerkat would have "home field advantage" over Periscope. The future is difficult to predict, but it is worth noting Facebook recently added a video chat option to its messaging app. Live streaming is distinct from both video chatting and produced content for YouTube. It is a hybrid of both because it has the mass appeal of YouTube videos and the connection of video chatting. The ads to service in front of this type of video may become a challenge because no one knows what the video is actually going to be about since it hasn't been filmed yet. Facebook would solve this problem by using the information it has gathered on each individual using the social network to service a curated ad. Facebook is clearly trying to create a family of apps so adding Meerkat would add to this goal since it already has a community of users. Although there are other live streaming apps, the only two that are in this distinct category which meld functionality, ease of use, and a social aspect are Periscope and Meerkat. Having only one major competitor is a great situation to be in. With Facebook on board Meerkat would likely gain all the users it lost to Periscope. It will be incredibly difficult for any new entrants into this space because they will face the same challenges Meerkat is facing now. Having a major social media player connected to this type of technology is necessary for it to flourish. Facebook doesn't have the engagement problem Twitter has. It probably can sit back and wait a few more months to have the concept be proved more if the management is worried the live video trend isn't sustainable. I am aware of the fact Meerkat was released before Periscope, but because Twitter has been working with the app longer than Facebook would be working with Meerkat I consider Twitter to be the first mover. Besides being a first mover, Twitter is a more instantaneous website, which makes it a perfect fit for live-streamed video. Even with these challenges Facebook can succeed. It has shown in video that it can take share from an entrenched player in YouTube. Twitter has only been involved with Periscope for a little over a month so the first mover advantage is much less than what YouTube had. I found the Jason Calacanis interview on CNBC to be enlightening. He made the point Google may have problems in the future because users will just turn on their phones and chat with experts instead of having to search for information through Google. Of course, these chats can be via texting or video depending on the circumstance. Live streaming apps can become a part of this because clearly there aren't enough experts in some areas to service one person at a time. If an expert streams out a live video and allows anyone to text in questions, this could be a part of the "instant everything" new way of gaining information. This entire article is about the future. I've asked many people what they know about Meerkat and Periscope and most still haven't heard of them. Facebook still has time to develop a live stream app itself or it can buy Meerkat if it can get it for a reasonable price. Live video will become mainstream in the next few years especially with the "instant everything" concept gaining prominence. Therefore, as an investor in the stock, I would like the company to come up with a strategy for the live streaming category and articulate it to investors by the end of this year.
