Learn more about PRO » Apple Hospitality REIT is owned by liquidity-starved investors who may sell upon realizing they can. We see minimal institutional interest to support the market price. Apple Hospitality REIT's (NYSE: APLE ) investor base has been liquidity starved for 7-10 years and will likely be disappointed in a listing price that is less than what they invested initially. Even at a listing price below what was initially raised, it is priced like a premier, bluechip, higher RevPAR hotel REIT with a phenomenal portfolio of assets. Instead, its assets are among the lowest RevPAR, and it has no clear value creation strategy. Consequently, we believe it should trade at a 9X multiple of 2015 FFO rather than the current 13X. This would entail a drop to $12.75 from the current $18.50 market price, with returns to short investors of over 30%. We believe there are numerous powerful catalysts in place to facilitate a drop to our price target. The rest of this article will detail why our price target more accurately reflects APLE's intrinsic value than does the market price and how soon it could get there. While I normally skip presenting basic company information in favor of getting straight to the analysis, the fact that APLE has only been trading for a few days suggests it will be largely unknown, so potential investors could benefit from an information dump. APLE's asset portfolio consists of 173 hotels with 22,003 rooms spread fairly evenly throughout the contiguous U.S. 15,520 of these rooms are in the upscale segment, with the remainder in the upper midscale and upper upscale segments. 93% of rooms are select service or extended stay with 7% full service. Apple Hospitality REIT has its origins in the non-traded REIT space where its parent company, Apple REIT, has been active since 1999. Over the past 15 years, it has founded 10 different REITs called Apple REIT 1 - Apple REIT 10. The now publicly traded one, Apple Hospitality REIT, is comprised of the combination of Apple REITs 7, 8 and 9 which merged in 2014 and became listed on the NYSE on May 18th, 2015. The history is captured in this snapshot from APLE's 2015 presentation. Apple REIT 9 raised $2B in late 2007 With a total of $4B of equity raised, it seems disappointing that its equity value as of 3/31/15 is only $2.98B. One could reasonably argue that the depreciation of $327mm should be added back in, but that still only takes equity value to $3.32B. What happened to the rest of the money? We believe it was a combination of two things; fees and unearned dividend distributions. Upon raising the capital, there is usually a substantial commission paid to underwriters/brokers. More fees can be attached to property acquisitions and dispositions and still more associated with the merging of Apple REITs 7, 8 and 9 and a final round of fees consequent to the listing on the NYSE last week. I am not insinuating that there was any illegal fee collection or necessarily any wrongdoing by anyone, but that in the non-traded REIT space, it can be the case that a surprisingly low portion of equity raised is actually invested in properties. This problem is compounded by the fact that dividend payments often start at very high levels and distributions begin before they are supported by property cash flow. Consequently, a large portion of dividend payments can be simply a return OF capital rather than a return ON capital. I do not have the information to prove that this is the case with APLE, but its dividend history supports my hunch. Dividends began at $0.073 per share monthly or $0.87 annually in 2008, and have been cut numerous times to its current $0.0567 monthly or $0.68 annually. Upon listing, APLE is executing a 1 for 2 reverse stock split and cutting its dividend to $1.20 annually as shown in its listing presentation. Adjusting for the split, the dividend is down to $0.05 monthly. This represents a 31.5% cut from the original dividend and a ~12% cut from current dividend. This brings us to the catalysts which detail how APLE could swiftly drop 30+% to $12.75. While the cut has been announced, I do not believe it has been informationally absorbed by the investor base. Non-traded REIT investors tend to be fairly inactive investors looking for steady yields higher than treasuries. Apple REIT 7 (now part of Apple Hospitality) was offered at $11/share back in 2005 with a 7.8% dividend yield. It has been illiquid for 10 years, with its investors simply getting dividend checks each month. It is likely that many of the investors do not maintain diligence as they have had no decision-making capacity due to the illiquidity. Many of them may not even realize the stock is publicly traded yet. When they do realize that they are finally liquid after being stuck for 7 to 10 years, I suspect the floodgates will open creating a massive imbalance between supply and demand of shares thus driving down market prices. What will make them suddenly realize it is public? The first public dividend is scheduled to be paid around June 15th, and the dividend check investors open up will be substantially smaller than what they normally get. This will trigger investigation which will facilitate awareness of liquidity. Immediately upon listing there are two strong forces encouraging the market price to drop. However, in its brief trading history, the stock is actually up ~3%. If liquidity-starved investors desperately want to be out of their underperforming investment, how can it possibly be up? Well, concurrent with listing, Apple Hospitality REIT announced a tender offer to buy the stock. APLE will redeem up to $200mm worth of tendered shares at the lowest tendered price between $19 and $21. Thus, investors must weigh their desire to get out against potentially getting more for their shares, as the $19-$21 tender is substantially higher than the $18.50 market price. I suspect the tender offer will be oversubscribed such that $200mm of buybacks will be split pro rata amongst the tendered shares. The tendered shares that go unfilled may end up getting sold in the market shortly after the offering period closes on June 22nd. That makes two back to back selling forces; on June 22nd with the tender offering expiring and June 30th when investors get a much smaller check than they were anticipating. More selling pressure may arise 180 days after the listing when the lockup on management-owned shares expires. All this selling pressure is only one-half of the equation as the supply of shares could potentially be absorbed by demand. If this is the case, the selling pressure would not result in a decline in market price. However, our valuation work suggests that buyside demand will be minimal at current pricing with the stock only representing a decent value proposition at or below our price target of $12.75. For our relative valuation, we will use the following set of peers which is basically the entire hotel REIT sector. *Cap rate, NAV and FFO data are FactSet consensus estimates as provided by SNL Financial **Apple Hospitality data is estimated by us based on information in company presentations and SEC filings The relationship between RevPAR and valuation is very strong. Among the peer set above, the correlation between RevPAR and cap rate is -0.8987. In other words, low RevPAR properties are valued at very high cap rates and the reverse is also true. At the high end, Pebblebrook Hotel Trust (NYSE: PEB ) and Strategic Hotels & Resorts (NYSE: BEE ) have cap rates of only 5.6% due to RevPARs of 199 and 224 respectively. On the other side of the spectrum, we see Hospitality Properties Trust (NYSE: HPT ) and SoTHERLY Hotels (NASDAQ: SOHO ) valued at 8.7% and 8.6% cap rates with RevPARs of 84.6 and 84.2 respectively. With a RevPAR of 92, Apple Hospitality certainly falls at the low end of the spectrum, so we have assigned it an 8.3% cap rate. This 8.3% cap rate translates to an NAV per share of $16.54. At its current market price of $18.50, it is trading at 112% of NAV, making it by far the most expensive hotel REIT on an NAV basis. Aside from Apple, the most expensive are Ryman Hospitality Properties (NYSE: RHP ) and Summit Hotel Properties (NYSE: INN ) trading at 102% and 101% respectively with the average hotel REIT trading at around a 10% discount to NAV. The companies at the lower end of the RevPAR spectrum trade at deeper discounts to NAV with SOHO, Ashford Hospitality Trust (NYSE: AHT ) and HPT trading at 75%, 71%, and 87% of their NAVs respectively. At our price target of $12.75, APLE would trade at 77% of its NAV, which puts it right in line with its low RevPAR peers. APLE looks equally expensive when valuing it on FFO multiples. In its listing presentation, Apple Hospitality revealed 1Q15 FFO of $60.75mm which it modified to $62.8mm by removing non-cash straight line ground lease expenses and one-time listing costs. These modifications seem reasonable, so let us use the $62.8mm figure for our analysis. After the reverse split upon listing, APLE has ~186mm fully diluted shares outstanding, so this translates to about $0.33 of FFO/share in 1Q15 which we need to annualize to perform valuation. Hotel REIT FFO tends to be somewhat seasonal with Q2 and Q3 being slightly stronger than Q1 and Q4, so we cannot simply multiply by 4 to annualize. Our analysis of peers with similar types of hotels in similar geographies shows about 22%-23% of total year FFO is earned in the 1st quarter, so multiplying 1Q FFO by 4.3 should give a reasonable estimate. By this methodology, our estimate for APLE's 2015 FFO is $1.42 ($0.33 in 1Q X 4.3). With a current market price of $18.50, it is trading at 13X 2015 FFO. We view this as exceptionally high relative to peers given its property portfolio. Only 4 other hotel REITs trade at a multiple of 13 or higher: DiamondRock (NYSE: DRH ), Host (NYSE: HST ), LaSalle (NYSE: LHO ) and Pebblebrook. These have respective RevPARs of 157, 162, 188 and 199. With a RevPAR of 92, Apple Hospitality clearly does not fit with this group. In fact, the correlation between RevPAR and FFO multiple is 0.7003, so we believe it should trade more in line with similar RevPAR companies. Companies with similar RevPAR are HPT, SOHO and AHT (note that I have excluded INN from the group despite similar RevPAR as it has a unique strategy resulting in rapid growth which throws off its valuation) with RevPARs of 84, 84, and 105 and FFO multiples of 9.0, 6.3, and 7.7 respectively. As APLE has relatively low leverage, we believe it should trade at 9X (the high end of this range). While we are short APLE and believe it is materially overvalued, there are some risks in shorting it that one should be aware of. The hotel industry is poised for strong performance with leading industry researchers predicting RevPAR growth through 2020. If this plays out, there is some risk of APLE trading up even if it substantially underperforms peers. At 2nd Market Capital, we are bullish on the industry and are net-long hotels despite our short position in APLE. At an enterprise value in excess of $4B, it is among the largest REITs in the sector, so it may see some demand from ETFs and top-down investors. Having raised money prior to the financial crisis, some of its properties may have been purchased at bottom of market pricing resulting in meaningful appreciation which has not shown up yet. Sale of such assets could generate a large gain on sale. Apple Hospitality REIT's investor base has been liquidity starved for 7-10 years and will likely be disappointed in a listing price that is less than what they invested initially. When combined with what we view to be substantial overvaluation, APLE could drop more than 30% in a short time frame. With the substantial selling interest on the horizon, there would need to be institutional buying interest to maintain market pricing, but we do not see institutions coming in at this valuation. The stock may not be desirable to institutions until it trades more in-line with its peers at $12.75. Thus, we believe the drop to our target price could be swift and largely uninterrupted with brief exception to the tender offer which may be the only thing holding up the price in the near term.
