Is Verizon Finally Set For A Breakout? - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha Verizon is set for a breakout above the $50 range that has held as resistance since 2013. Earnings growth and time has reduced the forward PE ratio to a more reasonable 13. After a couple of years of trading in a tight range, Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ ) finally appears ready for a breakout. While investors spent the last couple of years clamoring over the stock due to a high dividend yield and the excitement over 4G, the stock was extremely expensive when we turned bearish on it back in July 2012 (see articles here ). At the same time, along came a pricing war and the financials started feeling pressure at the end of 2014. Verizon spent most of the year struggling to even meet earnings estimates hampering any growth in the stock. In the process, Verizon has survived and still managed to grow earnings despite missing estimates. The forward PE ratio has dropped to a more respectable number over these last three years. VZ PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts For good companies, years of trading sideways can resolve a lot of issues. Verizon traded around $40 when we lost interest in the stock and now three years later at $50 it has seen limited annual gains in a bull market. For investors though, the story isn't about the past. The key is whether you should own the stock going forward. The intriguing part about Verizon is that it has survived the pricing war with improved margins. The wireless provider is producing strong cash flow from operations of $7.8 billion. After capital expenditures of $3.7 billion, Verizon produced free cash flow of $4.2 billion. That level of FCF will allow Verizon to do more than pay a high dividend yield. After the solid Q1 earnings beat, analysts are now forecasting that Verizon reports an EPS of nearly $4 in 2016. With earnings returning to a growth rate of nearly 10%, it will be difficult to keep the stock within the tight range of the last three years. While $109 billion in net debt remains a major issue, Verizon only has a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.5. The high FCF can quickly reduce this issue along with the $10.5 billion asset sale to Frontier Communications (NASDAQ: FTR ). All signs exist that Verizon is about to shake off the overvaluation that started in 2013 on the high hopes for 4G wireless. The stock is now attractively priced at roughly 13x 2016 expectations that might continue rising now that it has escaped the pricing wars. Verizon appears set for a breakout.
