Disney's Iger: Shanghai park near done; 'I believe' in ESPN value - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Mar  8 2016, 19:11 ET | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Disney ( DIS -1.5%) chief Bob Iger talked Shanghai, and gave a lot of air to much-discussed worries about ESPN, at the Deutsche Bank conference this evening in Florida. The company's Shanghai theme park -- its second largest, but with the biggest castle -- is on schedule for its June 16 opening, already more than 90% finished , he says: "It makes a loud statement." A branded subway stop will help deliver 20,000 people per hour to the gates. With regard to challenges at ESPN, Iger said there's still tremendous value in live sports that aren't a "niche" offering -- 95% of all pay-TV subscribers watch sports, he says, and more than 200M accessed content on various platforms during a recent month: "I believe in the brand value of ESPN,” even if it doesn't grow as quickly as it had in the past. Competitors to the "Worldwide Leader in Sports" are far behind and likely losing money , he said. There's still a challenge to crack the problem of younger viewers who are departing (or never signing up for) fat pay bundles. The company's not finished working on mobile issues, he says, and "some form of direct-to-consumer offering" of ESPN is being considered. Iger also said drama The Finest Hours -- which has made just $27M domestically and $40.5M total worldwide after five weeks of release, against a production budget reported to be $70M-$80M -- will result in a $75M hit to operating income this quarter. Isn't this stock almost impossible to price without the 10-K filing? With $2.5b in revenue (revenue not profit) back in 2014 and the extension of federal tax credits to solar beyond 2016, and recent sale of stock, wouldn't it be reasonable to assume SUNE (given the most recent news of Vivint terminating the merger) has the capital to stay afloat for a while? Maybe long enough for some financial restructuring to survive? I just don't understand the bankruptcy fears. I'm guessing that's why they settled their case with Latin America Power and failed to complete the merger, they're trying to hold reserves to avoid bankruptcy, question is what've been their expenditures and kind of liquidity do they have? Does anyone have any good references on that? you seem to be interested in sune on a dis piece. Dis is an investment;  sune is a gamble (I also have a sune position).
