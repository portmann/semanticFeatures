Ford: Why GM's Great Quarter Is Good News - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha GM just posted a fantastic quarter, beating on both lines and sending the stock up 5%. Ford shares many of the same fundamental basics as GM. We are hoping that General Motors' (NYSE: GM ) earnings tell us everything that we need to know about Ford's (NYSE: F ) upcoming earnings call. Ford is going to be reporting on October 27, and if General Motors was any indication how the domestic automakers are doing with their global rollouts, Ford investors will likely be very happy next week. We have already disclosed that we have a very long-term investment horizon for Ford, somewhere between 5 and 10 years, but while our investment focus is long term, we are of course interested in the short-term indicators of how the business is performing. This is part of the reason that every month, we monitor domestic auto sales, overseas auto sales, and monthly metrics like EU registration data, which gives us a look at the auto market in Europe as a whole. Judging by General Motors' last earnings report, all of the key points to our bull case on Ford seem to be "all systems go." To quickly review General Motors report, the company blew away bottom line expectations by posting $1.50 EPS, which was about $.30-$.32 above estimates. The company also posted $38.55 billion in revenue, which was slightly ahead of consensus estimates. Margins were well above 11%, and the company made the comment that "margins over 10% were here to stay." In addition, the company performed well in China and cited success overseas as supplementing its domestic success, where, fueled by easily accessible credit, US truck sales and SUVs outperformed. There are a lot of reasons why this is good for Ford, and we're going to run down the list of what we think is promising. First, the general narrative is exactly the same as what our bull case is for Ford. Since we have been writing about Ford, we have been stating that we believe the key to the stock driving higher is continued domestic demand supplemented by overseas operations that are trying to move toward profitability. We have been fans of the way Ford has allocated its capital in investing in itself and its operations in densely populated areas like India and China. GM's narrative to go along with this earnings report sounds very similar to what we believe Ford's narrative would be for a successful quarter. Second, the main focus was trucks and SUVs for General Motors. Since we have been writing about Ford, we have been stating that the company's F-150 line, supplemented by Mustang, was going to be the major driving force behind domestic auto sales. We are now officially over the question of whether or not the public is going to take to the new aluminum body vehicle, and we know now that the F-150 is a hit. Truck and SUV growth was solid for General Motors, and we believe that the signs of increased significant demand for these vehicles from Ford is going to propel Ford to also have a fantastic order. Third, General Motors' margins were fantastic. We also believe that Ford's margins are going to be impressive. We believe this because Ford had recently introduced a new higher-end luxury model of its F-150, specifically to meet the demand for consumers that were looking to spend additional money on this line of trucks. This type of demand at the high-end of the ASP spectrum tells us that margin for Ford could also wind up coming in as a very impressive number. Fourth, Ford consumers have essentially the same access to capital and credit that General Motors consumers have. If access to credit was what was really fueling General Motors' great quarter, we can expect the same to be true for Ford. In terms of the class of customer, and that consumers' access to credit between the two companies, there is likely very little, if any, difference. Ford consumers have likely taken advantage of very small incentives and the same easy access to credit that General Motors consumers have. Fifth, General Motors' success in China leads us to believe that Ford is also finding some success in China. As you may recall, Ford has invested a significant sum in China over the last 10 years, and the company actually recently added to that investment in the billions by investing in trying to create the next smart car. We wrote about this investment a couple of days ago, and we were pleased that Ford continues to use its capital to invest in itself, rather than making a significant buyback at these stages. Finally, in the data that we have looked at over the last 8 to 12 months, consisting mostly of North American auto sales and European auto registrations, Ford and General Motors have had very little deviation between each other. Thus, we believe that if General Motors can make these growth numbers work, that Ford can do the same. The main risk right now seems to be availability of credit. While this has been unfolding, there have been numerous questions beginning to rise about the state of subprime auto loans and whether or not we are beginning to create another bubble. Keeping one eye on subprime auto loans is a great way to keep one eye on potential risk scenarios for both US automakers. While keeping an eye on this risk, we continue to happily hold our Ford, collecting the company's healthy dividend, and awaiting this quarter's results. We think that applying a generous multiple of 10 times next year's estimates to General Motors shows that the company could be priced at above $53. We believe this multiple is fair based on the results that we got yesterday. Performing the same exercise with Ford, we would see a price target of about $19.30. Furthermore, we believe that the company will probably blow away analyst expectations after a few more years, once it has time to really dig in and saturate all of the international countries where it is still at the very beginning stages of its growth.
