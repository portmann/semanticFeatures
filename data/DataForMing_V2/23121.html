Disney Makes Wise Investment Into Daily Fantasy Sports - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Draft Kings will be enormous for Disney as the one-day fantasy market continues to expand rapidly. Disney can leverage its ESPN relationship to easily make Draft Kings the leader in one-day fantasy sports. When included into Disney's impressive portfolio, it continues to reiterate to us that Disney could be a great long-term hold. Aside from Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), there are not many companies we feel we can buy at any time and simply forget about. Disney (NYSE: DIS ) is right along these lines. It is one of the most diversified brands in the world and we estimate it's going to continue to be a steady, dividend-paying growth stock for years to come. We think Disney's portfolio of brands and revenue sources makes them a fantastic investment. We think their recent investment into Draft Kings is going to lead to further diversification of their sports offerings and potentially a big payday years down the road. Draft Kings has shown enormous growth, moving from 200,000 users to over 2 million users in a year's time. The company's founder is estimating 5 to 10 million users by next year alone. Disney isn't the first to invest in such a company. Draft Kings has raised over $74M in its first four years alone. FanDuel, its competitor and the company that founded one day fantasy sports, has raised $88M. Back home in the UK, when one wants to bet on a sporting event, all they have to do is go to their local bookies, or log on using the web. Shops like Ladbrokes and William Hill are all over the place. In places like Glasgow, where the populous is of lower means than other places, bookies literally can make their way onto every corner. The U.S. has nothing like this nationwide and thusly they have an untapped market for cash generation. The gamblers are out there, they're just limited to what they can participate in by geography. The internet solves a lot of that. The business has its pros and its cons. It's a tremendous generator of cash for the taxman, but it doesn't do well to help out areas that are already sitting on the lower end of the socioeconomic scale. This is why in the U.S., when a developer like Wynn (NASDAQ: WYNN ) wants to build a casino outside of Vegas, there's often pushback from communities and cities who lobby against it for the residual problems it can create, including crime and general misery for the populous. On the other side of the coin, it's an enormous multi-billion industry. In the U.S., gambling on sports is only possible in a couple of jurisdictions, including Las Vegas, and certain parts of certain states that have been designated as sports gambling friendly. New Jersey is fighting their own war just to try and get sports gambling passed in their state. They're having a tough go of it, although eventually we think it'll go through. For the most part though, online gambling is illegal in the United States and is heavily regulated. It's also for good cause. Full Tilt Poker's move into trying to get U.S. players to use their online poker site resulted in disaster when scandals were uncovered. The government should eventually realize that taking control over this sector, instead of shunning it and letting these types of shops sneak through the woodwork, would probably prevent issues like this from happening in the future. The solution to this problem has been found like most solutions to complex problems that could generate tons of cash; by finding a loop hole. The loop hole lies in laws governing fantasy sports and it was first discovered and exploited by a site named Fan Duel. Fan Duel offers one day fantasy sports just like Draft Kings. The loop hole is that because fantasy sports are "games of skill" and not bets on the games themselves, theoretically running a fantasy sports league for one day becomes a legal enterprise that you can risk real money on. Several American football seasons ago (six to be exact), Fan Duel was born and it began generating tons of cash from those in the states that were looking to spice up their sporting events by having something ride on them. In last December 2014 alone, Fan Duel made $2.8 million. It wasn't long after Fan Duel was born that Draft Kings came along (four years ago). It was another site that essentially offered the same service as Fan Duel. It was the Coke to Fan Duel's Pepsi (or vice versa). As these companies continue to grow and generate very real sums of cash, larger companies caught on. Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) invested in Fan Duel and just recently Disney invested $250 million in Draft Kings . In return, Draft Kings commits to spend more than half a million dollars to advertise on the ESPN platform in the coming years. While Fan Duel seems to be the preferred site between the small set we sampled (the guys in the office next door to us), we think Disney easily has the power to provide them with the capital and advertising space to make them number one, and leave FanDuel in the dust. Out of this chaos is eventually going to come a site that breaks out in front of the others. Since Disney already has such an impressive footprint into sports with owning ESPN, it's naturally going to leverage that relationship for Draft Kings ads. Investing here at a $900 million valuation is going to, in a couple of years, look unbelievably cheap (we believe). This will benefit Disney shareholders in the future. If Draft Kings continues to grow as it has been, who knows what will be next; a PE bid perhaps, or even an IPO. Such a situation could result in a significant return on Disney's investment that would benefit Disney shareholders. The risks to the business exist if the government finds a way to claim that these types of sites are breaking the law, or if sports gambling is some regard passes and becomes legal. Until either of those two things happen, it looks like one day fantasy sports is going to continue to grow. If we could have invested $500 million in Draft Kings at this valuation, we would have. Disney studios, which includes Lucasfilm, Pixar and Marvel Studios Disney consumer products, which includes the products based off of these films and TV networks We never considered ourselves Mickey and Minnie Mouse types, but that doesn't mean we're not contributing to the Disney revenue stream on a daily basis. It's so much more than that. Go about your daily business and see how many of the above subsidiaries of Disney you use, consume, or purchase on a daily basis. It's astonishingly everywhere. If it's not me checking footy scores on ESPN FC in the morning, it's my daughter that wants to go and see the next Pixar movie. Which is why we think Disney's stock continues to be one of the better buy and hold stocks that you can add to a portfolio with an outlook over 10-15 years. We'll be adding it to our dividend portfolio, which we're currently in the process of restructuring. The stock's dividend continues to grow as the stock does, for some compounding returns that could have been astronomical over the last ten years. Employing a simple DRIP calcuation would tell you that $10,000 invested in DIS at $30/share (333 shares plus reinvested dividends) could have netted you well in excess of $100,000 in just 10 years. Even with this broad diversification and continued strength in the brand, Disney only trades at a forward P/E of 19, price/book of 4 and price/sales of 3.5. Is the valuation towards the high end heading into a newer market climate when rate hikes hit? Yes. Do we think the valuation fits the current growth picture and longstanding foundation of the brand? Yes. Disney, we almost think, is cheap at any price if you're investing for the long-term. If we had our way, we'd like to see the company tend to it's debt as we move into the rate hike climate. Other than that, Disney is a cash flow generation machine, generating $10.42 billion in the last 12 months. We think Disney's investment in Draft Kings shows yet one more lucrative investment in diversifying its already fantastic portfolio. We are bullish on Disney for the long-term.
