Boeing: Some Challenges Await The New CEO - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha McNerney was unable to prevent major cost overruns on the Boeing 787 program. During the McNerney's lead the 737MAX and 777X were launched. Boeing (NYSE: BA ) shares dipped in after-hours trading on the news of CEO Walter James 'Jim' McNerney stepping down effective July 1st. McNerney will be succeeded by Dennis Muilenberg. In this article I will have a look at what McNerney is leaving behind for its successor and what to expect from Mr. Muilenberg. Boeing shares dipped in after-hours trading following the news of McNerney stepping down. McNerney became CEO of the Boeing Company in 2005, prior to that he was CEO of 3M and held various positions at GE. His 'GE training' brought the focus on financial performance, which is a good thing for investors. While McNerney was CEO Boeing increased production rates (to meet market demand and increase revenue) and launched the Boeing 737MAX and Boeing 777X, which should support Boeing's long term performance. McNerney's relation with Boeing's actual work force has been bad for years. In 2008 the union leaders called for a strike, which cost Boeing over $2 bn in profits. In the years after that Boeing management would move jobs from the Puget region and decrease Boeing's exposure to the unions. The South Carolina plant also gives Boeing some leverage in negotiating work rules with the workers in the union states to award assembly of aircraft. With this way of negotiating Boeing tries to squeeze out the maximum out of their workforce. For investors this is a good sign, but trust and moral of the workforce has been damaged and many hold McNerney responsible for this. Under McNerney's lead Boeing increased output on their popular 737 and 777 airframes. Although this might put severe pressure on the supply chain investors will be pleased as it increases the quarterly output of the jet maker and allows Boeing to pay higher dividends. Boeing has been increasing its dividend from $0.25 in 2005 to $0.91 in 2015. One of the aircraft that have been added to the product line is the Boeing 787. The concept was given green light before McNerney became CEO, but the multi-billion cost overruns that came with the program was not something that McNerney was able to turn around. The high costs have been caused by Boeing's effort in reducing costs by outsourcing work. As of 2015 the accumulated losses exceed $25 bn, while the Boeing 787 should go cash flow positive on a per unit basis later this year. In order to effectively compete with Airbus (OTCPK: EADSF ), Boeing came up with the Boeing 737MAX to counter the Airbus A320neo and the Boeing 777X to counter the Airbus A350 and strengthen Boeing's position on the market. Although McNerney is known for cutting costs, he was not able to prevent Boeing from a multi-billion cost overrun on the 787 program. About Muilenberg's view on how Boeing should be led we don't know much. The only thing that we know is that he supports Boeing's Partnering for Success program. The program is controversial as it is considered invasive by some suppliers and Boeing probably benefits more than its suppliers. Muilenberg has an engineering background and has been leading Boeing's Defense unit, where he led a major restructuring as defense budget decreased after the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. So Muilenberg is probably even more of a cost and job cutter than McNerney. He has no experience in the Commercial Aircraft department, so he probably will have other executives aiding him with that in the coming years. Although he has an engineering background, engineers probably will not benefit a lot from it. On the other hand as an engineer Muilenberg should have a better understanding of the production of engineering products and the development of aircraft. So whereas McNerney is seen as a business man that focuses on financial performance with very little affection for aerospace, Muilenberg actually has an aerospace background but will not be doing things differently as soon as he becomes CEO. So for Boeing investors I do not expect things to change: focus will be lying on financial performance under Muilenberg's lead as well. The Ex-Im Bank; In July a decision will be made about continuing the Ex-Im Bank. If it will be decided to discontinue the Ex-Im Bank it is interesting to see what will happen to Boeing jobs within US. McNerney said that if the Ex-Im Bank will be eliminated, a major relocation of jobs is required to remain competitive. Although McNerney's words should be taken with a grain of salt it is interesting to see how Muilenberg will deal with US jobs, relocating them to other countries will surely spark anger and will mean a bad start for Muilenberg. Filling the Boeing 777 Classic order book; Muilenberg and his team have to finish what McNerney already started: Selling enough Boeing 777 Classic airframes to fill the delivery slots until 2025. Ramping up production for the Boeing 737MAX and Boeing 777X; In the coming 5 years Boeing will bring the Boeing 737MAX and Boeing 777X on the market. It is up to Muilenberg to meet the targets set for both aircraft. Decision about a MoM aircraft ; Probably most challenging for Muilenberg will be the possible development of an aircraft family that can address the middle of the market and possibly replace the Boeing 737. Considering the cost overruns on the Boeing 787 and the tanker program, Boeing needs to make sure they keep development costs at a manageable level. Under McNerney's lead Boeing ramped up production and increased dividends, making McNerney a favorite for investors. Looking behind that McNerney also has been the man that fought unions and was unable to keep costs on the Boeing 787 manageable. Although Muilenberg has an engineering background, he will not be doing things differently than McNerney, but a major challenge awaits when Boeing is about to develop a new aircraft. Muilenberg and his team need to show that Boeing learned from its mistakes on the Boeing 787. For investors not a lot will change. McNerny and Muilenberg both have different backgrounds but their vision probably will be the same. Muilenberg has been Boeing's number 2 since December 2013 and nothing has changed in Boeing's strategy, a strategy that probably also has been laid out by Muilenberg.
