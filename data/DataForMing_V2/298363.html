Apple closes up 5.3% as markets jump; new 4" iPhone report arrives - NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) | Seeking Alpha To screen ETFs by asset class, performance, yield and more, check out the ETF Hub. ETF Hub Jan 22 2016, 16:47 ET | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor In his latest iScoop, 9to5 Mac's Mark Gurman reports a new 4" iPhone ( rumored to be in the pipeline for some time) will likely be called the iPhone 5se, and feature a design similar to the original 5S but with "upgraded internals, software, and hardware features." Among the new features: An 8MP rear camera and 1.2MP front camera (same as the iPhone 6's); an NFC chip/Apple Pay support (likely a positive for NFC chip supplier NXPI ); the iPhone 6's A8 CPU and M8 motion co-processor (NXPI supplies the latter); Bluetooth 4.2 and 802.11ac Wi-Fi; and the iPhone 6S' Live Photos feature. 3D Touch won't be supported, and the current 5S will be discontinued. The 5se is said to already be in production, and due to be unveiled at Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) reported March event "ahead of a late March or early April release." Gurman also reports the Apple Watch refresh expected at the March event will involve additional band color options and bands featuring new materials, with a full hardware revamp waiting until the fall. He adds Apple's "current plans call for an event-based introduction during the week of March 14th, but this could be reliant upon another product becoming ready for introduction in the spring, such as the in-the-works iPad Air 3." Apple rallied above $101 on a day the Nasdaq rose 2.7%, and the S&P 2%. Suppliers Cirrus Logic, Skyworks, Qorvo, and Multi-Fineline also posted big gains. FQ1 results arrive on Tuesday afternoon. "High-end" Samsung and Apple etc smartphone sales will shrink dramatically in the mass market in mid/late 2017 and going forward for the foreseeable future. Apple thinks it's a great strategy to go back to iphone 5 so that they can repeat the success of iphone 6. The death of the high end car, shoes, apparel, food, jewelry, wearables,... is coming sooner than most realize... An inconvenient truth, but you heard it here first. What is this, Apple? This game play was taken by Palm, when they came out with a tiny phone. Sounded like a joke.
