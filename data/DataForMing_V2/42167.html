Disney Ordered To Rehire Workers Who Refused To Wear “Contaminated” Costumes â€“ Consumerist Three performers fired from Disney’s Animal Kingdom in Orlando last June after they refused to wear costumes dubbed “contaminated” by other sweaty garments will be given their old jobs back and get back pay. A federal arbitrator ruled that the employees were in the right, and that Disney had violated a collective bargaining agreement by firing them, reports the Orlando Sentinel . The employees said the unitards they had to wear for the Festival of the Lion King show had been tainted by other sweaty garments that had been pushed up against their clean clothes. When they refused to put the outfits on, one of the shows had to be canceled and they were fired shortly after. That violated Disney’s contract, the local Teamsters union representing the workers argued, by giving them unsanitary clothing. “I’m really, really happy that everything ended up working out in the end,” said one of the performers, who will go back to the show. “This is just awesome news.” multiple unions are involved with disney. i was a member of the united food and commercial workers when i was there. and it saved my job more than once when there was a dispute with a supervisor. i had a supervisor who questioned my FMLA leave and decided i’d been at a wedding instead of out sick, because she had heard i was invited to a wedding (which was scheduled for two months in the future and she refused to accept the invitation as proof that the wedding hadn’t happened yet) the union had to step in and provide an arbitrator. but it happens all too often that arbitration is needed because disney will try to get away with everything if they can. it may be the happiest place on earth, but it is not the happiest place to work Using Times New Roman On Your RÃ©sumÃ© Is Like "Putting On Sweatpants For A Job Interview" Corinthian Colleges Completes Collapse, Closes Remaining Campuses Effective Immediately Consumerist is currently testing a new user experience.
