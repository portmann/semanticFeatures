Disney: What Does Star Wars Really Mean For The Stock? - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha The Force Awakens is a hit, so should you buy Disney shares? Disney is a media conglomerate with assets you might not realize. On Friday, Disney (NYSE: DIS ) released the newest edition of its Star Wars franchise, The Force Awakens. Even with high expectations (before the release analysts expected the movie to become the 3rd highest grossing movie of all time behind Titanic and Avatar), The Force Awakens beat expectations and has continued to break numerous global sales records. Disney bought Lucas Films for $4 billion in 2012, paying slightly more than it did for Marvel ($3.96 billion). Disney paid George Lucas with a mix of cash and 40 million shares of Disney stock (at the time making George Lucas the 2nd largest non-institutional owner of Disney, behind the estate of Steve Jobs as part of the Pixar transaction). This is great news for Disney (it will likely result in a great return on the company's $4 billion investment), but Stars Wars is just a small piece of the Disney pie. Most recently, investors have been selling shares on fears over declines at ESPN , which saw a 10% decline in viewership this year and is facing increasing pressure from cord-cutting. As an interesting note, ESPN is the most expensive channel for consumers when you break out a typical cable bill (the ESPN family of stations costs ~$8 per month). Disney also has a variety of other investments, such as its recent $400 million investment in Vice Media, its investment in cinematic virtual reality start-up Janut, its theme park assets, its broadcasting assets (such as ABC), and its movie studio. So the question is: Should you invest in Disney because of the recent success of Star Wars? We think the answer to that is no - it's just too small a piece of the company to justify investment. But, we do think Disney is positioning itself as a full-service media company that we believe can benefit greatly in an a-la-carte TV environment because of its unique package of TV content and its ability to leverage that content into revenues in other mediums such as its parks. So, even though Star Wars is a hit, and a great investment by Disney, this doesn't equate to a good reason to invest your money as an individual investor. The Actionable Insight Take: There's no doubt that the great performance of The Force Awakens is a positive for Disney - it shows that there is a big opportunity for the next films that will be released, and the ability for Disney to leverage this success into merchandise and attractions in its parks. But, we think this positive is incremental at best. Disney is a ~$200 billion conglomerate that is impacted to a far greater extent by TV broadcasting than it is by Star Wars. More importantly, the stock's price action shows that investors are looking past the success of this movie. The stock did rally on Monday off the news (most likely an influx of retail investors), but then quickly sold off and has been selling off since. What the price action tells me is that good news out of Star Wars isn't enough to offset the fears institutional investors have over other items, like ESPN. Trading at ~17x EPS, we prefer to stay on the sidelines and wait for a better entry point. Disney can be a core holding for those with a long term time horizon, but we'd prefer to start a position in the low 90s, where investors can get greater than a 1.5% dividend yield.
