Disney: Who Says This Old Mouse Can't Learn New Tricks - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Disney has been under pressure due to concerns over cord-cutting and a loss of ESPN subscribers. But the company has been a part of the streaming trend, albeit, with a one-third stake in the smaller streaming platform, Hulu. Ever since the end of last summer, many investors have predicted that this is the end for Disney ( DIS ), as consumers continued to abandon traditional cable and satellite subscriptions in favor of skinny bundles and streaming options like Netflix ( NFLX ). I mean, 96% of sports are watched live, but who cares about stats, right? Disney's ESPN unit was/is losing subs and therefore the whole company is finished. At least, that's what some would have you thinking. Back in September, I wrote that Disney isn't dead, partly because of its one-third ownership in the online-streaming platform Hulu. The other owners include Twenty-First Century Fox (FOX ) and Comcast's (CMCSA ) NBC, each with a one-third ownership stake as well, although Comcast doesn't have a role in management. I reasoned that investors should : "Think of Hulu like a hedge for the three companies. For Disney in particular, it could leverage Hulu to add on offerings like ESPN for an additional monthly feeâ€¦ Furthermore, between the content power and licensing agreements these three companies have, Hulu could become its own version of an online streaming skinny bundle service - where consumers have the power to start with a basic package, and pay for additional channel packages." For once, it looks like I might have predicted something that actually came to fruition. Apparently, Fox and Disney are working to create a $40 per month package of live and on-demand content containing programs like ESPN, ABC, Fox and FX, according to Re/Code. While this will likely stir the pot with its distribution partners, I think it's a good move for Disney. The company, while not exactly struggling, is clearly seeing a tipping point in the way consumers are taking in digital content. For the most part, Disney and Fox are in a very unique situation. In many instances, a company either has the content or the distribution channel. And while it's far from impossible for a company to have content and create a distribution channel (like HBO), or vice versa (like Netflix), it's not necessarily an easy task. Disney has an incredibly deep library of content it can tap and its sports content is very valuable. Having Hulu as a distribution unit can only serve to benefit the company at this point. It's a good thing the owners decided to pull this asset off the auction block, as they had previously looked to sell Hulu. I don't think ESPN is falling off a cliff, and given the rest of Disney's businesses like studio and parks, I do think the company will be more than okay. But its move from having Hulu as a "hedge" to a full-fledged platform to drive growth could be a game-changer over time. Disney's management is probably saying something like, "consumers are going to continue cutting the cord over the long-term. Why not let them cut and stick with us?" It's great to see this media juggernaut not only adapting with the times, but possibly positioning itself to (once again) be the leader of the pack. The other option is to close their eyes and hope it all goes away. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
