Robust Growth For The ARM Ecosystem Is Good News For Apple, Bad News For Intel - ARM Holdings, plc (NASDAQ:ARMH) | Seeking Alpha Oct. 22, 2015 12:36 PM ET  |  About: ARM Holdings, plc (ARMH) , Includes: AAPL , GOOG , INTC , MSFT , SSNLF by: Mark Hibben ARM Holdings 2015 Q3 earnings confirmed the continuing growth of the ARM ecosystem. ARM continues to benefit from the paradigm shift away from commodity processors to custom processors based on ARM IP. Apple pioneered the new paradigm and grew rich on the strength of iPhone and iPad sales. ARM Holdings' (NASDAQ: ARMH ) earnings highlighted robust y/y growth in revenue, operating income and ARM device shipments. This stood in stark contrast to the overall trends in the PC industry. Most importantly, ARM's smartphone revenue was up based on unit shipment increases as well as higher unit value. ARM noted that smartphones are transitioning to 64 bit ARM V8 faster than expected, and this will make it even more difficult for Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) to break into this market. In ARM's conference call , analysts expressed some surprise at the continuing growth of the ARM ecosystem and smartphone growth in particular. Based on assumptions about slowing growth in China, as well as the overall slowdown in unit growth for the smartphone market, it was assumed that this would negatively impact ARM's revenue and earnings. No such negative impact was in evidence. ARM's Q3 revenue in dollars was up 17% y/y to $375.5 million. Operating profit was up 31% y/y to $157.1 million. ARM device shipments on which ARM collects royalties rose to 3.6 billion units, a 20% y/y increase. Most importantly, the processor royalties were up 37% on the strength of the transition of the industry to the 64 bit ARM V8 architecture, which provides a higher royalty rate per chip. Uptake of the V8 architecture has been faster than even ARM predicted. ARM management originally thought the uptake of V8 would be 50% of smartphones by year's end, but it's already at 60% for smartphones. ARM now expects it to be 75% by year's end. This is good news for Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) in the sense that it validates Apple's decision to introduce the world's first 64 bit smartphone processor in the iPhone 5s back in 2013. I still get questions regarding the value of 64 bit processing and why it's of value for a smartphone. It's a tough question to answer without getting too technically detailed. In a rather general, simplified way, it represents a way to increase processing throughput without increasing clock rate. Data can be processed and moved around within the chip in 64 bit chunks rather than 32 bit chunks. The speed improvement can be as great as 2/1, but usually is less, depending on the specific operation. The designers of ARM chips are up against a clock rate limitation that's even more severe than for Intel based PCs due to the need to limit power consumption. Given this limitation, the move to 64 bit was a logical way to improve performance without sacrificing battery life. That's why it has become so popular in smartphones. Of course, Apple faces greater competition going forward. ARM noted that 64 bit, combined with multiple core (often octacore) processors are moving into the mid tier and low end of the smartphone market. But ARM also noted the "bifurcation" of the smartphone market into the high end (Apple, Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF )) and the rest of the smartphone industry that TSMC made note of in their earnings call. As I've pointed out, Apple is on its third generation (A9) 64 bit smartphone system on chip (SOC) and continues to lead in performance . Apple's custom designed SOCs continue to lead the pack, especially for ARM SOCs that use ARM generic designs such as the Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) Snapdragon 810, the mainstay for current high-end Android and Windows Phone devices. This SOC performance advantage, combined with Apple's superior integration of its mobile operating system and superior hardware design and quality, will assure that Apple's leadership position is secure for the time being. And it's worth noting that ARM's results don't convey a dramatic slowdown in China, at least not at the high end of the market where Apple reigns supreme. The other aspect of ARM's report that reflects well on Apple is that ARM is seeing the broad industry trends that I have been pointing to as the "paradigm" shift away from the commodity processor to the custom SOC. ARM has played a pivotal role in this move as the purveyor of CPU and GPU designs that can be used to create these custom SOCs. In the conference call, ARM made note of trends that bear on the paradigm shift. First, ARM noted the ongoing consolidation in the traditional commodity semiconductor industry. But even as the traditional semiconductor company customer base shrinks, device OEMs are starting to take up the slack by acquiring ARM licenses of their own. This is confirmation that the custom SOC paradigm is starting to take hold among other device OEMs beyond Apple and Samsung. An analyst also asked if ARM sees a move beyond the smartphone to "content creation" devices as ARM processors become more powerful. ARM management confirmed that they do see this trend and gave as an example Google's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Pixel C Android 2-in-1 device. ARM sees this as an ongoing trend. Companies such as Apple, Google and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) are all taking advantage of this trend to field more capable tablets and hybrid tablet/laptop devices. While the ARM-based devices are not yet as capable as their Intel-based counterparts, they offer greater mobility, battery life and light weight. In this space, Apple also is in a leadership position by virtue of the iPad Pro. Microsoft's ARM based Surface tablet isn't really as capable. Even as Apple continues to lead the new paradigm shift and benefit from it, Intel continues to resist it. To the extent that it does so, Intel has turned itself into a semiconductor Luddite that stands in the way of innovation. Intel's tablet and smartphone devices are so inferior to current offerings from Apple and Samsung that Intel has only been able to gain market share at the very lowest end of the market. In tablets, Intel has had to buy its way into the market by selling its processors below cost. Intel's current product roadmap calls for its SoFIA smartphone chips to be made on its own 14 nm process next year. Currently they are made on a 28 nm TSMC process that is two generations behind the current state of the art in ARM processors. But innovation in the ARM ecosystem is now so fast that even when Intel moves SoFIA to 14 nm, it won't be enough. At the high end of the market, Apple, Samsung and Qualcomm will all offer higher performance. At the low end of the market, companies such as Mediatek will have SOCs that are faster and cheaper. Intel simply has no way to pump more life into the x86 architecture where mobile is concerned. As ARM devices become more powerful, while maintaining their cost advantage, they will continue to drain consumer and enterprise dollars away from the traditional PC market. This trend, which started with the first iPad, will only accelerate. Every quarter, Intel predicts that the PC market will stabilize. This is wishful thinking. In the Internet of Things (IoT), Intel has claimed some growth, and conveys to investors that a huge IoT opportunity awaits Intel. The massive volume of non mobile device ARM chip production, approximately 3 billion of the 3.6 billion devices ARM reported shipped for Q3, belies this. For the vast majority of IoT applications, the lower cost of ARM chips makes them a better choice. ARM's stock has been in the doldrums for the past year but got a nice pop following the earnings report. It's clear that the perceived threat of Intel had much to do with this, as Intel mounted its tablet and smartphone initiatives. Part of the surprise of analysts may have derived from the expectation that Intel's efforts would be more effective. I'm not surprised. As readers of my past articles on ARM will realize, I've been a longstanding champion of the platform and its most prominent beneficiary, Apple. ARM and Apple have been at the forefront of the new SOC paradigm. As the paradigm shift gains momentum, ARM and Apple most stand to benefit. ARM continues to be highly valued, in terms of P/E. However, I doubt that the stock will slide any more than it has. Now is probably the best opportunity for investors to buy ARM.
