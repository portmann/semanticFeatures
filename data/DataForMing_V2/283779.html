(TWX) | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor On a media-blitz day for Time Warner ( TWX +2.3%), between a Citigroup investor conference and the Television Critics Association press tour, the company says it will take on Netflix ( NFLX -2.7%) by pressing for more "stacking," negotiating for full-season rights to shows for on-demand viewing. TNT and TBS have "made it clear" to studios that they want to be able to air full seasons, and "you are starting to see momentum," says CFO Howard Averill. “We have to continue to move along that path to make sure we provide the consumer what they’re looking for.” The prospect of binge watching could help slow the erosion of pay-TV subscribers, many of whom are only able to watch the past few episodes a show via authenticated "TV Everywhere" services. Recently, for the first time, the company's Warner Bros. studio sold a show to Twenty-First Century Fox (Lucifer) allowing cable subscribers to view the first season on demand. For its part, Fox is responding to Netflix by selling more content to Hulu, which it co-owns with Disney and Comcast. Averill today said Time Warner was going to end the fiscal year "just above the high end" of guidance for $4.60-$4.70 of EPS.
