New Disney signs will warn about gators - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Jun 17 2016, 02:48 ET | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor Disney (NYSE: DIS ) is installing signs that warn theme-park guests about alligators after a 2-year-old boy was snatched and killed by one of the animals at the company's Orlando resort on Tuesday . The boy's family has not yet announced if it will file suit, but relatives said that they are "devastated" and thanking "local authorities and staff who worked tirelessly" after the attack. i despair of mankind in general when i read something like this.....well i suppose one has to be  eaten by a gator before one can whip such signs out...... that area was infested with these animals...it seems there are so many around that even golfers recline on them between rounds.....something had to give There's a story floating around that a gator came up on shore during a fireworks show in the exact same spot a few months ago.  Disney did nothing from preventing it from happening again or to warn guests. I'm long Disney (have been for 2 decades) but they screwed the pooch on this one. Get your checkbook out Mr. Iger, this one is going to sting.
