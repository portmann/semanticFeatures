Frontier Communications: It's Almost Over - Frontier Communications Corporation (NASDAQ:FTR) | Seeking Alpha The long saga of the Verizon asset purchase is nearing an end. The story hasn't received the coverage I think it deserves to keep investors up to date so I provide details as to where things are currently. The company has gone all in on this deal, its largest ever, and I report that it is nearly complete. Independent of the deal the company is performing well, but once it's closed and the deal is behind it I think shareholders will see performance improve. I recently covered Frontier Communications Corporation (NASDAQ: FTR ) as a stock that I have had my eye on for some time but had one substantial concern . After a few years of pain the company appears to be on the right track, though customer loss needs to be eyed. But I like the name as a dividend investor. I'm attracted to the fact that it pays a bountiful dividend and the stock price has stabilized. In fact, I support reader notions that you can trade this name around your core position. Buying when it dips well below $5 and selling when it surpasses that mark. This strategy allows you to hold on to the name, collect dividends, but make some trading profits along the way. The company recently reported Q3 2015 revenue of $1.43 billion, operating income of $207 million, and operating income margin of 14.6%, compared to revenue of $1.37 billion, operating income of $193 million and operating income margin of 14.1% in Q2 2015. I was pleased to see margins expand. When combined with expenses net loss attributable to common shareholders was $14 million, or $0.01 per share. However, if we exclude acquisition-related interest expense of $52 million and acquisition and integration costs of $58 million, adjusted net income was $35 million, or $0.03 per share. But what acquisition talks am I referring to? It's time we revisited the elephant in the room that has been holding the stock back a bit and generating expenses this year outside of the core business. So what am I talking about? I am referring of course to the purchase of Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) assets in California, Florida and Texas for about $10 billion. It's a big deal for Frontier. In fact it is the biggest ever . But I feel that this deal has been weighing as it still moves along. While Verizon has been making all sorts of moves, Frontier has stuck to its core business waiting for these assets to be cleared for sale. Now in order to finance the purchase, the company priced a $6.6 billion debt offering . It's using these proceeds to finance all three of the state level purchases from Verizon. It's among the largest junk bond deals this year. It's quite impressive. The company priced $1 billion of 8.875% senior notes due 2020, another $2 billion of 10.5% senior notes due 2022 and finally $3.6B of 11% senior notes due 2025. Let's not forget the company also set up a $1.5 billion term loan to finance the deal and conducted an equity offering in June . The company is all in on this one. The overall deal is expected to close in Q1 2016, Q2 2016 at the latest. But of course, there are many regulatory hurdles. First, the FCC. The company received antitrust clearance in May and thankfully the FCC has approved the deal. So that is out of the way. On top of that, the Texas Public Utilities Commission already approved a certificate of transfer, so the sale is cleared for the assets in Texas . No such approval is needed in Florida. The one state that I worry about is California. It simply is anti-corporate, despite it housing many of the tech giants of the world. Perhaps I am being biased, but it is ranked one of the least business friendly states for multiple reasons, one of them being regulatory hurdles. That said, we recently got good news. Earlier this month Administrative Law Judge Karl J. Bemesderfer with the California Public Utilities Commission issued a favorable proposed decision proposing approval of the deal to purchase the California assets. This is the last hurdle as I mentioned above that the company has already received all other necessary regulatory approvals. While I expect the deal to close in Q1, it is pending final California Public Utilities Commission approval in California. The full California Public Utilities Commission is expected to vote on the proposed decision by the end of the year which to my surprise actually follows the original schedule set out by the California regulatory agencies. Thus, it is looking very good for Frontier. Without this transaction the company is already seeing revenue growth was driven by strong pricing power and a shift of customer mix. Of course, for a high-yield company like this what really matters is cash flow. It helps cover dividends and is a measure of strength. The good news is operating cash flow was actually up quarter-over-quarter to $532 million from $528 million for Q2 2015. Further the company's dividend represented only a 46% payout of free cash flow for Q3 2015, an improvement from 53% in Q2. So the company is standing in its own, but I'm excited to see the impact of the new assets in 2016. I think this name still makes a solid addition to an income-generating portfolio. The payout ratio is favorable. Income metrics are improving, specifically revenues and cash flows. Finally, the long process of the Verizon asset purchase is nearly at an end.
