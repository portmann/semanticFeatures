Will Competition In China Upset The Apple Cart? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha The market seems to focus on the war between Samsung and Apple for high-end smartphone users. Apple has turned to China as its next leg of growth. But Xiaomi, Huawei and others are taking the China market by storm just as that market's growth sags. Smartphone market share wars have never been so intense. This chart based on Strategy Analytics data shows the tug-of-war between Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) for the past few years. At the outset, the iPhone ruled the roost with a 16.1% market share while Samsung's Galaxy S2 launch started with Samsung holding a 10.6% market share. By the time the Galaxy S4 was introduced, Samsung had carved out a market share over 30% while the iPhone was stuck about 20%, and it was a Mexican stand-off through the fall of 2014 with Samsung holding about 30% of the market and Apple less than 20%. Both Apple and Samsung saw their market share fall in parallel through the early part of 2014 as very good smartphones from competitors like Xiaomi; LG; Huawei; and, Lenovo ( OTCPK:LNVGY ) pushed the leaders backwards. Apple finally abandoned Steve Jobs's insistence on a four-inch screen and made real headway with the iPhone 6, capturing a marginal lead over Samsung in the fourth quarter of calendar 2014, but that lead began to vanish in early 2015 even before the Galaxy S6 was launched in early April. Apple's grasp on the top spot did not last long. By the end of the second quarter of 2015 iPhone share had fallen to 12.8% while Samsung held on to 20%. Apple's loss of share reflects both competition and the volatile nature of key markets. Just as Apple put its emphasis on China, smartphone demand in China seems to have peaked. Growth has shifted to Africa the emerging Asia - Pacific markets where Apple is poorly represented, while unit shipments in China have reportedly declined in the past quarter. Dollar sales have shown good growth despite the decline in unit sales in China and outpaced unit sales by 90% in North America where demand for flagship smartphones such as iPhones and Samsung's Galaxy S6 have impacted average selling prices. By contrast, faster growing markets in terms of unit sales have seen a shift to lower priced phones - for example, in Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe where sales in dollars have suffered double digit declines despite higher unit sales. Foreign exchange has no doubt had an impact with the dollar surging against many foreign currencies. Other than burgeoning demand for higher priced smartphones in China and a few developed markets, the trends do not favor Apple. Indeed, the rise of Xiaomi and a resurgence of Huawei are making it hard for Apple to build on earlier advances in the key China market, made even more complex by declining unit demand overall. In China, the real story is not the classic battle of the titans, however, but the emergence of strong Chinese competitors who are equally battering Apple and Samsung in this key market. Xiaomi is now 50% larger than Apple in China and twice as big as Samsung. Hot on its heels is a resurgent Huawei climbing to 16% of the China market. It should come as no surprise that iPhone sales have flat-lined in the past couple of weeks in the face of these trends, as shown by this chart of Mixpanel.com data. This is an "off-year" for the iPhone, with the September launch of the iPhone 6s and its variants likely not much more than a tweak of the existing iPhone 6 models albeit with a somewhat faster processor and the introduction of "ForceTouch" screens both possibilities. Neither of these is likely to prompt much enthusiasm. The expected A9 processor will do well to match the Samsung Exynos AP in the Galaxy S6, and "ForceTouch" seems more like a gimmick than any meaningful innovation. In parallel, the slowing economy in China coupled with the recent devaluation of the Chinese currency just makes the iPhone less affordable and no doubt less in demand in that key market. Apple is falling behind top Android phones in performance, with Galaxy S6 variants 50% to 70% faster than the iPhone 6 Plus based on multi-core Geekbench scores. Apple may remedy that gap this month with its new A9 processor, but spring 2016 is sure to see a response from Samsung and Qualcom (NASDAQ: QCOM ) as the game of leapfrog continues. It has taken a while, but in my opinion the bloom is finally coming off the rose and Apple shareholders have had their day in the sun. Noted analyst Ming-Kai Chuo of KGI Securities sees iPhone sales falling below last year's 74.5 million in the current quarter. Declining iPhone sales cannot be good for Apple. Apple Watch has been lackluster and for all the fanfare Apple Pay is a rounding error in Apple's income statement. Apple has enjoyed a terrific run. Its iPhone 6 phablets have been a blowout success. I think they will be a hard act for Apple to follow. I am short the stock through puts. Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
