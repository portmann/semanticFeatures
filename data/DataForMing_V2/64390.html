Intel's (INTC) CEO Brian Krzanich Hosts Annual Stockholders' Meeting Conference (Transcript) | Seeking Alpha Good morning. As the voice said, I am Andy Bryant, Chairman of the Board of Intel. I would like to take this moment; it’s my pleasure to welcome you to the Intel 2015 Annual Meeting. With me is Suzan Miller, inside the company we call her Sam. So, I am not forgetting her name when I say Sam will do such and such. It is her name as we know her. The meeting will be live in the auditorium in Santa Clara and will be webcast as well at the Investor Relations site intc.com. We have eight proposals today. We will elect directors for the coming year. We will vote on the selection of Intel’s auditors. We will hold an advisory vote to prove executive compensation. We have an amendment and extension to the 2006 equity incentive plan. And we have an extension of the 2006 stock purchase plan. And we will have three stockholder proposals to consider. And I would like to note that all proposals must be presented properly to be considered. The polls are now open for those who have not already voted and wish to, and will remain open until 9:00 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time. Then we will have our CEO, Brian Krzanich reporting the state of the company. We will have a question-and-answer session. And in the question-and-answer session, we will take questions, both from here and from the Internet live. Refer to the printed program for the agenda and also the meeting. And with that, I would like to introduce Sam, Corporate Secretary who will take you through the formalities of the meeting. Thanks Andy. On April 2nd, we began to distribute our meeting notice and the Proxy Statement and March 23rd was our record date for the voting of approximately 5 billion shares outstanding at that time. Approximately 85% of those shares are present in person or by proxy at this meeting. This is the majority of the shares outstanding which is a necessary quorum for the meeting. If you have already voted as Andy said, you don’t need to do anything further. If you want to change your vote or have not yet voted, you can do so with the representative of our voting tabular forum who is in the back of the room. Jim Alden [ph] from American Election Services will be serving today as our Inspector of Elections. The polls close at 9:00 a.m., so all voting must occur before then. Now also the part that I know is the reason all of you came and it may not be exciting to you but it is my inaugural reading of forward-looking statements. Finally, some of today’s presentations including Brian Krzanich’s business update contain forward-looking statements. All statements made during the annual meeting that are not historical facts are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially. Please refer to our recent Q1 earnings release, our Form 10-K and most recent Form 10-Q for more information on the risk factors that could cause the actual results to differ. If we use any non-GAAP financial measures during the presentations, you will find on our website, intc.com, the required reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. And a remarkable reading that was. I was sure that the audience was going to break into applause when you finished. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank the stockholders who returned their proxies and are here to vote in person. We have eight items to deal with today. Our first proposal today is election of 11 directors. I would now like to introduce the nominees. I will ask you to stand and remain standing until all have been introduced and of course hold your applause so then we don’t want the meeting interrupted by constant applause. First, Brian Krzanich, CEO of Intel. Next, Charlene Barshefsky, Senior International Partner at the Law Firm of Wilmer Hale. On the phone is Aneel Bhusri who is Co-founder and CEO of Workday, Susan Decker -- that was Aneel, Susan Decker, Principal of Deck3 Ventures, also attending by phone John Donahoe, President and CEO of eBay, Jim Plummer, Professor of Electrical Engineering at Stanford University, Dave Pottruck, Chairman and CEO of Red Eagle Ventures and Frank Yeary, Executive Chairman of CamberView Partners and me, Andy Bryant, the Chairman of the Board. And with that, you all may be seated. So, I’ve begged and got your applause. The other nominees Reed Hundt and David Yoffie were unable to attend the meeting today. There were no other nominations submitted in accord with the bylaw requirements and nominations are now closed. The second matter today is ratification of the selection of Ernst & Young as our Intel’s independent auditors for 2015. I would like to introduce the two partners here and ask you stand as well Geoff Lang and Matt Sapp [ph] from Ernst & Young. Our third item on agenda will be an advisory vote to prove executive compensation. We are asking stockholders to prove on an advisory basis, the compensation of Intel’s listed officers, as described in detail in the proxy statement. We have a long history of strong pay-for-performance alignment and we believe that our compensation programs operate in the best interest of our stockholders. While this is an advisory vote, the Comp Committee and the Board take it seriously, if issues arise through the vote that will certainly research those issues to directly better understand any concerns of the stockholders and take appropriate action. The next item is the amendment and extension of the 2006 Equity Plan. This is the plan we use to grant stock options and restricted stocks to employees. Our policy is to present the plan every two years for approval by the shareholders, the stockholders, so that they can actually see how we’re using the plan on a fairly frequent basis. Next item will be the extension of the 2006 Stock Purchase Plan. This is a plan we use to give employees the opportunity to acquire stock through periodic payroll deduction, apply towards the purchase of Intel common stock at a discount. The primarily purpose of this plan is to provide employees with the opportunity to acquire ownership stake in the Company. We present this plan for approval every five years so that again the stockholder could see how we’re using the plan. The final agenda items today are votes on three stockholder proposals. The first stockholder proposal was submitted by Mr. Harrington and his representative, Father McManus will be presenting the proposal. Is Father McManus here? Please step forward to the microphone and we’d like to offer you five minutes to present your proposal. Good morning, Mr. Chairman and all here. I rise to move the resolution on the Holy Land Principles. The Holy Land Principles are pro-Jewish, pro-Palestinian, and pro-Company. The principles do not call for quotas, reverse discrimination, divestment, disinvestment or boycotts. The principles do not take any position on solutions to the Israeli-Palestinian issue. The principles do not try to tell the Palestinians or the Israelis what to do. The Holy Land Principles only call for fair employment by American companies in Palestine-Israel, who could even begin to argue against that. Irrespective of what Americans think about the Palestinian-Israeli issue, one thing is certain, all Americans expect American companies in the Holy Land to practice fair employment. Our resolution calls on Intel to set the standard by signing and implementing the Holy Land Principles which are best on the very effective MacBride Principles for Northern Ireland. Initially American companies doing business in Northern Ireland resisted signing the MacBride Principles, but now 116 American companies doing business in Northern Ireland, eventually saw the light and signed the principles. Intel tried to get the SEC to exclude this resolution, naughty-naughty, but the SEC in its great wisdom and profound knowledge, ruled against Intel and in favor of the Little Holy Land Principles. So that tells everyone the world over that the Holy Land Principles therefore are intrinsically valid, inherently fair and reasonable and in the best American tradition. This is a historic moment and that it is the third time ever that an American company is voting for the Holy Land Principles. Intel should sign the Holy Land Principles that is the American way. God bless America. Thank you. It will be. So called progressives have really been in action for the 2015 proxy season. 433 right thinking shareholder proposals were submitted dealing with environment, political activity and human rights. Proxy Preview, a group who tracks this stuff calls Father McManus’s proposal, a human rights proposal. It is not. The proposal is a polemic and not a serious attempt to cure any evils on the part of Intel management. We know this right off because the authors choose to call the land in which Intel operates Palestine-Israel. The Romans in defeating the Jews in 70 AD renamed the land Palaestinia. When I was a boy, I made donations $0.05 at a time to Jews of Palestine. But in 1948 the nation of Israel came into being. This proposal attempts to change the name of Israel back to Roman times as if the Queen of England decided to bring the name of the state of Maine back to its 18th century name Massachusetts. It’ll never happen. If you read this proposal carefully and related items on the web, you will see the proposal for what it is, an anti-Semitic screed against the Jews of Israel and an argument against their continued survival. Good morning. I am here like, I live in this county. Welcome Father McManus. I will speak against the proposal. I invested in Intel Corporation because of its activities in Israel; I was so impressed by that. Intel-Israel, it’s good for the corporation; it’s good for Israel; it’s good for the world. Intel has an exemplary, exemplary human rights policy for which I commend the leadership of this corporation and its development. I looked at the HLP, the Holy Land Principles in detail. I read the pamphlet over and over. I was shocked by the omissions in the principles. Yes, it’s a good thing to say there should be no discrimination on basis of national, religious, ethnic origins. But there’s nothing about gender; there’s nothing about sexual orientation; there’s nothing about disability in these eight principles. In other words, one, if I were being snippy I might ask does that mean that the HLP thinks it’s okay to discriminate against people in Israel or anywhere else on the basis of gender, for being a woman, for being LGBT, for being disable, for being pregnant. But if you read that, those proposals, that would be a logical conclusion. I don’t understand why those are admitted. Intel’s principles at governance operation in Israel are 10 times better than the HLP, I’m sorry to say. And so I understand the, by reading carefully the language that the HLP is anything but neutral and unbiased. And reading the language, the weak-weak language, you’ll understand that. But I’m going to ask that we reject these on the basis that it’s a shockingly inadequate set of principles that allow discrimination that Intel would never allow on its own. Thank you. Thank you for your comments. And thank you Father McManus for describing the proposal. Intel recognizes and the board recognizes that the importance of equal employment opportunity for all applicants and employees. I’m proud to say that Intel’s policy and practice in Israel and around the world meet the tenets of the Holy Land Principles. We believe that adding staff and compliance process for principles to which we already comply to be redundant and unnecessary cost as well. For that reason, we recommend against the stockholder proposal as well. The next item is a stockholder proposal submitted by Mr. Chevedden. Is Mr. Chevedden or representative here today? Please step to the microphone, we would like to offer you five minutes to introduce your proposal as well and can you please state your name for us? Good morning, my name is Barbara Flaherty [ph] and I stand on behalf of John Chevedden to move proposal number seven, Independent Board Chairman. Shareholders request that our Board of Directors adopt a policy that the Chairman of our Board of Directors shall be an Independent Director who is not a current or former employee of the company, and whose only nontrivial professional, familial or financial connection to the company or its CEO is the directorship. The policy should be implemented so as not to violate existing agreements and should allow for departure under extraordinary circumstances such as the unexpected resignation of the chair. Shareholders are best served by any independent Board chair, who can provide a balance of power between the CEO and the Board empowering strong Board leadership. The primary duty of a Board of Directors is to oversee the management of a company on behalf of shareholders. A combined CEO chair creates a potential conflict of interest, resulting in excessive management influence on the Board and weaker oversight of the management. Many companies already have an independent chairman. An independent chairman is a prevailing practice in the United Kingdom and many international markets. This proposal topic won 50%-plus support at five major U.S. companies in 2013, including 73%-support at Netflix. Please vote to enhance shareholder value, both for Independent Board Chairman, proposal number 7. Thank you. Thank you Ms. Flaherty. [Ph] The Board’s general policy, based on experience, is that the positions of Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer should be held by separate persons. And as an aid to the Board’s oversight of management, if the chairman is not an independent director, the Board appoints a lead director to serve as the independent lead director. The independent directors are a significant majority of the Board, currently 9 of 11 directors, and the Board’s policy allows the independent directors to implement the Board’s leadership structure that they believe is best suited for the Board at any particular time. The Board believes that its existing policies empower the independent directors to act independently of management and better serve our stockholders than the inflexible rule requested in this proposal. For these reasons, we recommend stockholders vote against the proposal. The last agenda item today is submitted, a stockholder proposal submitted by Mr. Rehm and Ms. Geary. They have appointed Ms. Larry [Ph] as their representative, standing in front of the mike at the moment, so I don’t need to ask her, she is here. Please take five minutes to describe this proposal. Thank you. I stand on behalf of Investor Voice of Seattle, to move proposal number 8, which calls for simple majority voting. Currently a number of corporations like Intel choose to use two different voting formulas when tallying votes at their annual meetings. This simple majority proposal seeks to remove abstentions from the formula and to harmonize how our company counts and reports, votes’ results to the SEC, its stockholders and the press. Intel already uses a simple majority formula for director elections. So it should be neither cumbersome nor difficult to adopt simple majority at the uniform standard across the board. A recent white paper study, the impact of counting abstentions. It examined voting in the S&P 500 and Russell 3000 over 11 years. We’ve evaluated more than 20,000 individual votes. The Wall Street Journal published an Exclusive on this research and Corporate Secretary magazine named a simple majority issue in Must Read for Executives. One key finding among many, rather than having a neutral effect, counting abstentions creates 7.6 times greater negative impact on shareholder proposals than on management terms. The study’s findings correlate to make it clear that when Intel pushes abstentions into its formula, the result is not neutral and all items are not treated equally. Intel shareholders deserve a harmonized, fair and consisted voting system, not a two-count system that creates multiple outcomes, advantages Board’s elections, skews other vote and disproportionately harms shareholders. Three points in closing: Number one, from data provided by Intel, 61% of the Company’s own peer group already use the simple majority standard and 48% of the S&P 500 and Russell 1000 do as well, which makes this a reasonable and mainstream request. Number two, a third of companies receiving this proposal have adopted simple majority to enhance their governance; all these are from S&P 500 and half are Delaware chartered like Intel. Number three, simple math shows the counting abstention skews votes and research now provides conclusive evidence that it also inordinately harms shareholders. Shareholders deserve accurate, equitable and consistent vote counting. And Intel should match the governance standards set by 61% of its peers. Therefore, please vote for proposal number 8. Thank you very much. Thank you. The board certainly recognizes the importance of good governance and we have evaluated this topic and have not found any indication that the vote counting standard requested in this proposal is viewed as a corporate governance best practice, or otherwise as an emerging trend. We view the proposed changes unnecessary and contrary to the best interests of our stockholders. The vote counting standard, Intel currently applies to both company and stockholder proposals other than election of directors as required by law, acknowledges and gives effect to stockholders’ affirmative action to abstain on a specific matter and is the standard applied by most large public companies incorporated in Delaware. For these reasons we recommend against the proposal. The next order of business will be the CEO report. But before we get to that, I would like to take a moment to thank Cary Klafter. Cary, please stand. Cary, recently stepped down as Corporate Secretary, plans to retire from Intel later this summer. He has presided over 18 annual meetings and we thank him for his service. Thank you, Andy. Good morning everybody. It’s good to see everybody here this morning. I thought I would give -- just start with a summary of 2014 and give you a picture of how I saw the company’s performance and then will spend a little bit of time on 2015 as well and just talk about what are our objectives and what do we see as our imperative. So, let’s start with just a quick look at 2014. We really look at 2014 as a strong year when we really performed well and our technologies really came into its full maturity. For 2014, there was a total shareholder return. This is including stock appreciation, plus dividends and so on 44%. And if you take a look over the last decade, we’ve returned about $94 billion over the past decade. The cumulative investments in our business over that period of time, has been the $149.6 billion or roughly $150 billion. So investments in the business and shareholder return has certainly been a focus. I think 2014 really represents the results of that. $55.9 billion of revenue was a record year; gross margins of almost 64%, at 63.7%; generating net income of $15 billion -- or operating income of $15 billion and net income of $11.7 billion and a dividend per share increase to $0.90. And for us that really represented quite nicely, our performance and how the technology demonstrated over the year. I’d like to take that 2014 perspective and turn that into our -- what is our vision, mission and strategy for growing this company moving forward. Our mission is pretty simple and that is, utilize the power of Moore’s Law. By the way this is the 50th anniversary of Moore’s Law this year. To bring smart connected devices to every person owner. And the real objective here is that smart and connected. And we believe and you’ve seen our investments in our communications technology that almost everything that you build moving forward will have some form of connection, whether it’s Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, LTE, things are going to mean to be connected whether you go from data center down to the smallest of the wearables or Internet of Things, all of those things have to have this connectivity. And that keys into some of our strategy, which I’ll talk about in a bit. Our vision is if it’s smart and connected, it’s best with Intel. We’re really trying to use Moore’s Law and our architectures to really drive that best in performance. And best in performance sometimes is in form factor, small and light, low power or sometimes it’s in just pure raw performance in nips or instructions or how we want to measure the performance, graphics capability. And our growth strategy is really driven off the combination of these two, that is -- we believe our highest shareholder return, our highest shareholder value will come from a strategy that uses our core assets to move into profitable complementary markets. The good example of that is how we’ve started with the PC and what I’ll call client computing and moved that in both directions. And we’ve taken those technologies and moved into the data center and have built data center products now that have built off those same cores, those same silicon technology. And we moved down into the Internet of Things. Many of the cores that we use, many of the products that we develop for the Internet of Things are simply products that we scale down or made small altercations to, to bring them to the Internet of Things. So, those are two good examples that demonstrate that strategy and action. I thought I would take a look there at what we said last year. This is my third shareholder meeting. And I think that one of the things that Intel prides itself is being held accountable and showing performance. And so, we went back and we pulled up our foil from 2014 and we thought we would grade ourselves a little bit, and we’ll talk about this. We said we would do five things in 2014 that we would continue to lead in Moore’s Law, we’ll talk a little bit about that we build on our ultra mobile momentum. And this is really around tablets and phones, and we’ll talk about that both in 2014 and we’ll talk about that again in ‘15. And we continue PC innovation, core of the business, the majority of our revenue and income comes from, and we need to continue to innovate there. And we delivered double-digit growth in the data center and we’ll talk about that, but as we said, this really drives off the fundamental technologies and architectures that we built in the core products. And then drive leadership in the Internet of Things and wearables and we’ll show you some examples of that this morning as well. So, let’s take a look at these, one at a time and how to break them down and look at the performance in ‘14. If I take a look at the first one, continue to lead in Moore’s Law. We continue to think that this is really one of the core-strengthens of Intel. Last year in 2014, we introduced our fifth generation core products on our 14-nanometer technology. But in addition to that we’ve introduced products in the memory space that are really leading in both density and cost with 3D NAND. We believe we have a world-class leadership position here with 3D NAND. And then just our overall silicon technology; 14 nanometers is our second generation of 3D transistors or FinFETs for those who know the real definition of it. And it’s our true 14-nanometer technology, leading in density and compaction. So, we continue to see that our Moore’s Law leadership continues. We continue to see Moore’s Law beyond what you might read in the press that Moore’s Law’s ending; we see a future of Moore’s Law well beyond what is presented off and out there. So Moore’s Law is alive and going. The next thing we said we would do is PC innovation. And I really think this has been a great year for this space. We said last year we would accomplish a couple of things. First was we said we’d establish a footprint in the critical tablet business. And if you remember at the beginning of the year, we said we would go out and we would ship 40 million units of tablets. At the end of the year, we were really proud with that, so we’d actually beaten that by considerable margin; we shipped 46 million tablets. We actually became the number one merchants’ provider to the tablet industry. And what’s also great is we led with innovation. And if those of you attended 2015 CES innovative product events, was a tablet that was built between Dell and Intel. The Venue 8, which is just a phenomenally the world’s thinnest tablet, great screen and was the first product that introduce RealSense. Since then we’ve also in 2014 introduced a number of form factors and really innovated, two in ones, all in ones; they’re becoming thinner, lighter and more mobile. You can see that people are starting to utilize those much more. And an entirely new form factor with the Compute Stick where you can now take a full computer with you in your pocket and plug it into almost any monitor. We really believe this is a form factor that will continue to grow as we look forward and you’ll see even more innovation in this space. With products from all price points and we introduced the product last year SoFIA. SoFIA is a product I’m very product of. SoFIA was not even on our roadmap as we entered into the fourth and third quarter of 2013. And by the end of 2014, not only had we qualified that product for production but we’ve gone into China and built a partnership with Rockchip to produce those parts as well and they do their own designs around that architecture. And I can tell you that towards the end of Q1 of this year, 2015, they actually qualified their products as well. On both of those products we’ve already gotten orders for over 1 million units on each. So a product that was not even on our roadmap a year and half, has already have orders for over 1 million units in each and is shipping in production. We’ve worked really hard to become OS agnostic and we make sure that our products run on over OS out there. I think this is critical for the growing markets and the diversity of the markets that we’re into. And really where I see a future of computing is in these experiences and innovations there. We started to see really just the inkling versus what we see in our labs and we’re starting to see wireless charging. As we go through into the second half of this year, more and more of our products will ship with wireless charging and then you’ll begin to see RealSense. We have product shipping right now with RealSense but as we go in again through the remainder of this year and into next, RealSense which is really giving compute, eyes; the ability to both see you and see the world and understand it; do something with it. It’s going to really change computing as we know it. You’re interaction with computing but computing’s interaction with the world. All of those things will shift we believe with these experiences. So we really feel good about the innovation that we’ve done on the client space in this last year with a lot more moving forward in ‘15. The data center I think is -- we look at it as our next big growth engine for the company. It’s a business that’s over $14 billion a year now; it grew at 18% last year and it’s being fueled by almost every segments of the data center, from software defined networking and infrastructure to enterprise computing; high performance computing; Big Data applications. And you saw our relationship with Cloudera this year and our efforts to really improve Big Data applications and the speed at which they can be implemented. And then one that’s the big driver is the cloud. Remember, we said everything needed to be connected and the importance of that, that’s because everything feeds into the cloud now. And all your data and your information tends to move there and that connectivity provides that ability. But our data center products are really what fuels and powers the cloud as well. That’s allowed to grow at 18% last year. We’ve committed to grow at 15% through this decade. And as I said, this will be the next real engine of the company for revenue and growth. The next area is really driving some of the next, I would say the future of where computing is headed and that’s really the Internet of Things and wearables. And you saw us really drive a new energy and a new focus on the Internet of Things. Internet of Things business grew 19% last year and it’s over a $2 billion business annually now. So this is not a new and emerging business; this is a $2 billion business, growing at 19%. We said we can commit to grow through this decade in those mid to high teens as this business continues to expand. And people talk about 50 billion devices by 2020 that will be tied into this Internet of Things and again that connectivity comes to play there. We’ve got products like SoFIA, Edison, the Galileo boards and you saw us introduce at CES of this year, Curie, which is a full computer that can fit in a button on your jacket. The products that are being innovated will come out on all of these devices over the next few years are amazing. And in wearables, you saw use-- we have the Basis Peak watches which are, really if you look at fitness tracking and fitness monitoring, one of the best products out there. You saw us introduce the MICA bracelet with Opening Ceremony which is really a full cell-phone on your wrist from a data standpoint and a variety of partnerships with companies, leading companies like Fossil and SMS and Oakley and Luxottica, all of these companies are working with us now to build products over the next couple of years in this wearable space, using these innovative technologies like Edison and Curie and products beyond those that we haven’t even introduced yet. So, those were our key imperatives for 2014. We feel very good about our progress there. I thought I would then take a look so you can measure us again next year at the same meeting and what our imperatives are for 2015? First is to continue to innovate in the core business. The client computing, PCs, desktop, mobile and tablets will continue to be a core of this business. We need to continue to innovate there. We think this year we will ship somewhere between 10 million and 15 million phones into the market. Asus ZenFone 2 which launched earlier this week in the U.S. is just one example of products now coming to the U.S. with Intel Inside. So, we’re making progress in all areas of the mobile in this segment. Profitably grow our mobile business. We’re committed to reduce our losses in this space by $800 million this year and we are on target to do that. Stacy and I report at every quarterly meeting our progress and we are on target there. Deliver double-digit growth in the datacenter. And as I said we’ve committed to have 15% through this decade; we will continue to grow that this rate. You saw results in Q1 continued to meet or beat those numbers. Grow our next new big businesses, which we really look at is the IoT space and that memory space. 3D NAND we believe gives us a very competitive cost and density advantage that will let us continue to grow, what’s over a $2 billion business in memory already. And then we talked about the IoT, which again is an over $2 billion business which grew at 19% last year and will continue to grow in those teens for this year as well. And then lastly is continue to lead in Moore’s Law. The fundamental driver of this company will always be Moore’s Law and the silicon underneath it. And we need to continue to be seen as the leader and to actually deliver those leadership products. And so Moore’s Law is critical to how we drive the growth. The last thing I want to talk about is that a company needs to do all of that while taking care of the community and planet we all live in. And so, we call that doing the right things, the right way which is really delivering those results in a way that has a corporate responsibility and a community responsibility. Today we released our 14th Annual Corporate Responsibility Report and we invite you to go visit our website to download and learn more about the responsible businesses and practices that we follow in all around the world. I am very proud of that as a company. I’ve been a part of this company for over 30 years and that’s always been an area that I personally have engaged in. And I can tell you with high confidence that’s an area that we as shareholders should be proud of. And so I really invite you to go look at that report. And as you drive out today, if you look up on the roof of our main building, you will see, I think there’s about 15 micro turbines and there will be over 60 level; largest micro turbine installations in California at least, as we continue to generate power in alternative ways so to say. So with that, I would like to invite Andy and Renée on stage, Andy back on stage. Renée, let me introduce Renee James, our President of Intel and we are -- I am going to hand it quickly over to Andy in order to take questions. We’re not going to sit down because we’re trying to keep this media a little more informal. And Andy, you know how to control. So we’ll take questions from this audience, we also will take questions from the web. If you have questions, we have two mics set up, so please get to one of the mics. In fairness to all who wish to speak, we ask each speaker to limit their time two minutes. Any specific topic will be limited to six minutes. And with that we’ll take the first question, actually we have one in the room. I’ll go and take one in the room here. Please state your name and your question. My name is Peter Fant [ph] and I came all the way New Mexico. And I appreciate, thanks for the presentation. I appreciate the corporate response because particularly I wanted to address that or bring that up as -- also the diversity in the workplace that Bryant had been in the press that Bryant has been the champion because what I do right now I have a company in New Mexico and I work with your New Mexico operation for outreach to Native Americans and particular we have a STEM scholarship program that Intel’s now been involved with and they’ve been working with us and we’re looking at students that we’re getting out of program and getting into internships with Intel. And it’s a particular challenge just because with this particular ethnicity, it’s not only working with the students but it’s getting back into the communities. And your guys out there Sean Sabeti [ph] in the Rio Rancho Facility is doing great job working with us, getting into the communities, getting that message back to grade schools. So, it really ties the corporate responsibility that Brian mentioning and I just wanted to let you know I really appreciate that and look for continued support in the future. So, thank you. It’s our transparency I should say. And Peter is a good friend of mine. And it just shows you that people who are raised up in similar ways, end up in similar type of jobs and with the similar value set. So his effort on social responsibility with his company has been equally as good as well. Let me take the next question from the web. Question is what mechanism does the Board use to evaluate the performances of directors? And for that one, I would like to turn it over to our Lead Independent Director, Sue Decker, who is here in the front. Do we have a mic for Su. Yes, we have been evaluating director performance for over 15 years. We have an annual process that we go through as a team. We take into account individual performance; we take into account committee efficiency and effectiveness; and we take into account how the Board works as a whole. This last year, we decided to add to that a deep interview system of all of the directors and that will be overseen by the Lead Independent Director, but conducted by an independent third party. So we plan to start that in January 2015 and do that annually to coincide with the performance evaluations of employees. Thanks. My name is Sheldon Ehrlich, [ph] I am a very small shareholder. How can we get business from Apple? That’s my question. That’s good. All the Mac lines, whether it’s an iMac or Mac Pro or MacBook Air, all of those products and innovation that goes in side of our -- are based on Intel architecture. And we worked together very-very closely with Apple team to deliver those products. I think they represent the innovation in the industry quite well. So that’s if you take a look at it, that’s a growing part of our business and it’s a growing segment and I want to continue to earn that business. And that’s what key with Apple. There is that iPhone. Again, you see us -- we’ve had to point the Company to the mobile space, to the phone and the tablet space. We made great inroads in tablets last year and we said we’d be shipping somewhere between 10 million and 15 million phones this year. The way to win Apple is that you have to build the best products for the best price and that will be when we get into those other apple products. We have to go with it. And so we’re working on it, we’re constantly working on it. There is -- but it ends up, it’s always about whether you can build a product that meets their needs at the right price. So, we’re working. Okay. Next question from the web will be what does Intel do to align the pay of executives to drive value to stockholders? For that one I would actually turn to our Compensation Committee Chair, Dave Patrick. Good morning, everyone. We work very hard at this. We believe that we have alignment of the way we pay-for-performance. Our bonus plans have very specific metrics that align pay-for-performance in terms of annual performance and setting the stage for the future. The best majority of compensation for our CEO, our President, our Senior Executives and even going down into the company is around the incentive comp and that’s bonus plans and stock options, restricted stock, a very large portion of our senior executives equity compensation is tie to the performance of our company, total shareholder return of our company versus a comparable list of 15 other tech companies. And we make sure that we’re providing a total shareholder return that meets and exceeds these comparable companies in our industry and our executives are held accountable for that and their equity awards go up and down based upon that relative performance. We consider that to be extremely important. So, we constantly monitor this. We hire consultants to help us. We try to have best practices. We study other companies to make sure that we’re at the leading edge of making sure that our employees’, our leaders’ compensation is fully aligned with the returns to shareholders and the benefits to shareholders. Is there anything also I should add to that. No? That sounds okay. All right, there you go. My name is Joseph Pruss. [Ph] Intel has been kind of around the block on content streaming devices, thought a lot of that was abandoned couple of years back. Can you explain where you see this relationship with the Chinese company Rockchip in your TV dongles or your HDMI TV sticks? Where do think Intel is going with that relationship and your new product? Our relationship with Rockchip is around building products like SoFIA. What they provide is a channel. Actually they provide two things. They are in additional design resources, so they actually take our first generation SoFIA, as an example. And they may do additions or changes, so that it’s targeted towards the markets and channels that they are targeting. So in the cases of the 3GR, they did some improvements to graphics; they did some improvements to some of the memory modules and things like that. But what they really are is they are very, very good at what I’ll the Shenzhen and Beijing ecosystem which is working with roughly 1,000 ODMs, literally 1,000 ODMs that make sub $150 tablets for Asia. And that channel is one that for us to go and invest and get into would just take too much effort, too much money and we’re not as good as that matter. So, working through them as a partnership, we feel is a better way to enter to those markets. And that’s really the relationship. We will bring products as they see they want to grow into segments. So for example they’re 3GR, they just qualified for IoT, so they did expanded temperature and environmental specs for that product, so, they could take in into IoT applications and we’re helping them write software and applications for that. Things like the Compute Stick are products that they may or may not choose to take over time. You can’t really use SoFIA for that product; they just didn’t have the graphics and things like HDMI capability. But we could work with them to develop a product that could do that over time. But there is no plan to do that currently with them. Compute Stick is driven more by what I call, our classical OEMs partners. I’ll take the next question on the web. Can you update us on how your mobile strategy is progressing? What recent successes would you highlight again? Again that one is for Brian. Sure. So, I’d say, again, let’s just take a look at last year. We came out and said that we were going first target the tablet space, so we get to 40 million. I think when we started last year and we put out that 40 million unit target, people kind of questioned our ability to go from roughly 0 to 40 million in a year. And as I said, we hat 46 million tablets but really what’s neat to me is the innovation that we are able to bring as well. For 2015, we said we’ll grow what the market grows out for the tablet space. My guess is actually the tablet space may actually shrink a bit this year as two in ones and phablets the bigger phones kind of eat into that market. But our focus for this year was to really reduce our losses in mobile. That $800 million target was what spaces I put out there for reduction of that loss and we are well on our way to that. Every shareholder meeting people, come in and said when are we going to see you in a phone? We’ve been shipping phones starting in last year to some volume. But again, we think we’ll be in roughly 10 million to 15 million phones this year and you can actually start to see and penetrating the U.S with the ZenFone 2 is the first example of that. So we feel like our mobile progress is going well and our strategy of entering these markets using partners like Rockchip and Spreadtrum and now focusing on cost is the right one to go to. I am Shirley Lin [ph] of Silicon Valley. I appreciate hearing that the Company name a product after Madame Curie, someone who not only won a Nobel Prize but twice. I have two questions today. First, what were the lessons learned from some instances, some years ago and in 2014 they had come home to risk [ph] with a fine of $8 billion. The second question is without seeing any other soother, seeing that today is the annual meeting, how much factor does it play in the company resuming the talk with Altera so quickly? What I read was in 2014, some instances happened some years ago has caused the company to be fined for $8 billion. That was in the news I saw. Then I was wrong, I thought it was with Intel and it was some years ago and it might have been something related to the European… We did pay a fine over $1 billion several years ago based on European investigation of Intel that’s how many years ago, three, four, five? There has been nothing current; there has been no issues that we’re aware of. I thought that it was just decided, completed their investigation and then decided on a fine 2014, but were the lessons learned; even though there were instance that happened, I mean still billions of dollars are billions of dollars. I think what came out of that was a set of practice changes that we’ve been combined with the sales group and the legal team to really ensure that all of our sales are independent. In other words, we don’t tie them to any kind of market-share gains or competitive alternatives. So, when we go in and sell to somebody, we can’t tie our price to, if they give us a 100% share or they keep the competition out or any kind of competitive risks like that, with a very strong audit process, plus on a very strong audit process to make sure that we’re never selling below cost to ensure that our products are out there competing fairly with the competition and not below costs. And there is a very strong audit process that again the legal team and the sales team go through on a regular basis and is inspected by our auditors as well. So, we have an audit process, an independent audit process and a set of guidelines now for the sales and legal team to do pricing, how contracts are set up, and how negotiations are done to ensure that the practices are faired even. Well that’s good to hear because it’s certainly -- those practices are good, hopefully Wall Street will follow your kind of practices as well. So my second question… To your second question, we as a policy, don’t comment on rumors or reports on the papers that we -- we are not part of. So, I understood what your question was. We will not comment on any negotiations with any companies that may or may not be going on. The next question from bridge. What is Intel’s long-term plan as we begin to push up against limitations of smaller transistor geometries? That one, I turn to Renée. As you heard from Brian, it’s the 50th anniversary of Moore’s Law. And we feel that we’re in a normal 10-year horizon of development and the near in five-year we’re in execution. And this year we will take our 14-nanometer process, will crossover to be our predominant high volume process. The thing that follows 14 is 10-nanometer and the 10-nanometer development is progressing very well. You’ll start to see start-up cost in the second half of the year on 10-nanometer. And we will talk about the timing of that later this year, the early part of next year about when that will happen. After 10, comes 7-nanometer and we feel very confident that we have line of sight of how to manufacture that note. So overall, we think we’re in very good shape. My name is Guiney [ph] and I have couple of questions. Number one is that does Intel have a green energy initiative in the emerging market? Number two is does Intel have any initiative to encourage the growth of electrical vehicles in this country? So, I can answer both of those questions, especially since I own two electric vehicles. So, absolutely we have an effort to work with electrical vehicles. If you take a look, I think we have over 25 electric vehicle charging stations on this campus and we have them at every one of our campuses. So, we have actually, if you take a look at the charging stations per employee, they’re one of the highest densities or the largest numbers in the valley here. So, we are big proponents of supporting those kinds of products. If you just take a look at what do we do across the world from energy reduction and energy conservation; in the U.S., we are the number one purchaser of green power and have been for three plus years, probably four years now. So, we buy green power projects to offset a 100% of our operational cost in the U.S. There’s solar installations at almost every single one of our worldwide large locations. So, there may be small sales offices that we don’t have them at or small locations or least locations. But if it’s a company-owned and it’s out there, almost anywhere in the world now, we’ve installed a solar energy to pretty much maximum we can fit on our roof tops now. And we are looking at continuing alternatives. We’ve got Bloom Energy systems which are LP driven systems in Folsom and we are installing one in India now. These are first Bloom Energy system in India, powering our new building that we are building there. And then you see us experimenting the things like micro turbines that you will see on the roof here that if those work, we’ll carry them out to other locations as well. We also have in the audience here Michael Jacobson, Director of Corporate Responsibility. If you have any of these types of questions, you want grab some of the afterwards, he is the one who got to spend some time with. Next question from the web. What are your long-term prospects for the PC market; are you seeing continuing secular decline; are you seeing a cyclical impact? Brian? Sure. So, we -- if you take a look at last year, PC market actually grew; it actually grew in the low single-digits. And we think that was largely fueled by XP replacement. And so we continue to see growth from that. As we entered this year, we are going through another transition, Windows 10 upgrades. And we are seeing some quarter-to-quarter pushing but we continue to take a view of our long-term forecast. A long-term forecast is the PC market should be flat to slightly down mid single-digits over the long-term. There are going to be years where it’s higher, it’s positive, and there is going to be years where it will be a little bit lower and it will certainly have quarter-to-quarters, call it, economic or macro implications. But over that long haul, we think it will be stable to down mid single-digits. We’ve built that into all of our forecasts and we are offsetting that with growth in the datacenter and those other businesses. And that’s how we grow the company. My name is Steve Young [ph] from Hillsboro, Oregon, I am a shareholder. I am concerned about the Folsom site, the lake or the Folsom Lake is the principal water source for Folsom; and last year it was on the verge of dead pool which is a federal designation where the water, the level drops below the water intake for clean water. Is there any plan to move Folsom site or any plan for the site at all? And is there going to be anymore expansion in Oregon? So, there is no plan to move the Folsom site. Remember, the Folsom site is not a manufacturing site; it’s mostly, I will call it office building kind of site, so it’s not a heavy water user in anyway. I agree California is state wide under a drought condition. And if you take a look at this site for example, we’re expanding it into other sites or so that’s surely pulling out of our lawn. If you go into -- our central courtyard, we have taken all our lawn. So, we’re trying to become more and more water wise and we will move that to Folsom as well. I can’t talk about -- there’s no published plans for further expansion in Hillsboro but I can talk about things that are on a public roadmap. Next question from the web. What is the company doing to increase diversity on the Board? I will take that one. Most people say diversity, they are talking about a general unrepresented minorities. So let me start there. We did adopt a policy; it’s in the Proxy Statement that says as we look at approval of candidate, we will ensure that we have both generative diversity and unrepresented minorities. We currently have I would say a list of potential future candidates who are looking at and then hat’s included that our policy says it will be. But really to us, diversity goes well beyond that. If you look at our Board, I think you would realize it has been thoughtful, everybody -- nominee gets elected a day, it’s 18% 11. [Ph] We have strategic professor, we have technical professor, we have two current setting CEOs, we have people from Washington D.C. legal representatives. So, if you look at the way we’ve built this Board, we’ve built it looking at a different skills and capabilities we might need. We’ve actually looked at international. We’ve had in the past, a Director from outside United States. So, our concept is to find what we think are the matching skills for the Board and to complement we do believe stronger that you get a better results if you have diverse skill in the room and hear diverse opinions and voices. I think you were on the mic next, so we’ll hear. Good morning. As one of the older member of the stockholder group, I remember when my first times in business, we were talking about never using germanium is the chip from which were working. And as a member and as working for California’s two technologies Jet Propulsion Laboratory that time we were one of the first to have to move to Silicon. So the question I’m asking is how far can we ride this silicon horse and what is Intel doing to take care of the limit of what silicon will eventually -- the limits that silicon will eventually impose upon us, and what alternative is available to us? As I said in my earlier answer, I think we have good line of sight with silicon for many notes to come. We have an advance R&D organization that looks at materials and is looking to beyond the 10 year horizon and experimenting. Would you add more to that? We put materials on silicon now to enhance silicon. So, we deposit germanium and we can deposit the films that you probably look at next for speed and performance truly just on the silicon itself to build those devices. Beyond that, we are looking at other products as Renée said. But right now, those are out-passed the 10-year mark. And the reason I don’t give you a list of them is because the way we have it always is in this funnel; and there is probably 20 of those elements today that will narrow down over time. Hello. My name is Shirley Lin Kinoshita, I am President of the Silicon Valley United Nations Association and Intel Shareholder. I just wanted to applaud you for your corporate responsibility. You live in a world that has many needs. One thing I did not hear was Intel’s corporate response to humanitarian needs. We are facing tremendous stresses from refuges and migrants in the world that are affecting us locally as well as worldwide. The United Nations is celebrating its 70th anniversary this year. It was founded in San Francisco. So we have close ties as a region to the principles of the United Nation which includes human rights as well as humanitarian aid. So what is Intel doing specifically in this arena? So, we do many things, to start with the Intel philanthropies and foundation. So, our foundation efforts, we work with a variety of multinational organizations, both on direct relief for things like existing disasters like earthquakes in the fall et cetera. We send technical people. We actually have an outreach team that comes in and mobilizing team and helps with technology and getting people back connected. When we had earthquake in Chengdu, we actually used our own facility for clean water and for housing people. So, we do have a response team as part of our foundation for immediate to faster. Then through NGOs we have foundation contributions and our employees are able to their own donating through our Intel matching program to their own charities of choice. Thank you. With I’m going to close the question-and-answer session. Brian, Renée, thank you. Hello. I am one of the electric car drivers also. Mine is not as nice as Brian’s but it’s still electric. So, I will do the preliminary results. The final results are going to be available early next week. Each Board nominee received a vote of approximately more than 65% of the shares voted and so each nominee has been reelected. On the ratification of the selection of the company’s independent auditors, approximately 99% of the shares voted were voted in favor of the proposal and so the proposal is approved. On the advisory vote to approve executive compensation, approximately 95% of the shares voted were voted for the proposal and so the proposal is approved. On the amendment and extension of the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan, approximately 92% of the shares voted were voted for the proposal and so the proposal is approved. On the extension of the 2006 Stock Purchase Plan, approximately 98% of the shares voted were voted for the proposal and so the proposal is approved. On the Holy Land Principles stockholder proposal, approximately 3% of the shares voted were voted for the proposal. So, the proposal is not approved. On the Independent Board Chairman, stockholder proposal, approximately 30% of the shares voted were voted for the proposal. So, the proposal is not approved. On the Simple Majority Voting stockholder proposal, approximately 80% of the shares voted were voted for the proposal. So the proposal is not approved. Final vote tallies including the ballots submitted today will be posted on our website at intc.com and in our next filing with the SEC within four business days. Thank you. Thanks Sam.
