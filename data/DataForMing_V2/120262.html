Netflix: Firing On All Cylinders - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha NFLX reported 2Q with robust user growth on both domestic and international markets. Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) reported a 2Q15 that underscored my bullish view on OTT services and that it remains to be the beneficiary of the cable unbundling and cord-cutting trend in North America. More importantly, international expansion is on track and NFLX's ability to create content based on local taste highlights the company's ability to adapt to new markets and cater to local viewer preference. And this could suggest that NFLX's entry in Japan and China may turn out to be successful and becoming a bigger catalyst for the shares in 2016. As such, I remain bullish on NFLX. Domestic streaming is growing steadily and benefiting from the cord-cutting trend in North America while user growth via global expansion appears to be sustainable. Consolidated revenue of $1.6bn, +22% y/y, was largely in-line with consensus while EPS of $0.06 beat. However, the revenue and the EPS were irrelevant for the quarter as the street focused on subscriber growth and NFLX certainly did not disappoint on this front. Domestic streaming subs net adds of +900k handily beat the 600k guided bymanagement. Of total streaming subs, 740k were paying subs with an ARPU of $25.22, +4% y/y. This is a stark contrast to that of North American cable companies such as Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) (NASDAQ: CMCSK ), Time Warner (NYSE: TWX ) and Cablevision (NYSE: CVC ), which have seen a net decline in subs due to cord cutting. In addition, higher ARPU highlights NFLX's pricing power relative to that of the cable companies that have been introducing ARPU dilutive skinny packages as consumer preference toward the big bund diminishes. Domestic revenue of $1.02bn, +22% y/y, and contribution margin of 33%, +120bps sequentially, clearly defined NFLX's ongoing success in North America. In short, the domestic segment's performance was nothing but spectacular. International did not disappoint neither with net subs adds of 2.37m vs. the 1.9m guided. Of the total net adds, 2.34m, or more than 99%, are paying users, highlighting NFLX's platform stickiness and user retention ability in the international market. This should come as no surprise given NFLX's offering of quality self-produced content along with popular movies and TV shows that resonate well with the global audience, which is one of the key reasons why NFLX has seen tremendous success in its overseas expansion. In my view, NFLX could translate this success for markets in Japan and China, which could be a bigger catalyst for 2016. I note that NFLX's entry into China via a partnership with either BesTV or Wasu Media, backed by Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ), is a sound strategy. However, the company may need to venture into the hardware business (ie. smart TV, set-top box) in order to compete or stand out among the competition as one of few fully integrated OTT players globally. As I mentioned before, there are over a dozen top online video sites in China led by Leshi, Youku (NYSE: YOKU ), Alibaba, Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU ) and Tencent ( OTCPK:TCEHY ) but one issue with the Chinese OTT players is the lack of material differentiation. This presents an attractive opportunity for NFLX, which has a portfolio of self-developed content that could prove to be competitive against the local players. I remain bullish on NFLX post results as the company is wel positioned for the cord cutting trend in North America and subscriber expansion globally.
