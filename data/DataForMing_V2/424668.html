Disney: The Happiest Stock On Earth - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Shanghai Disneyland should add incremental earnings in the near-term. The stock is off almost 8%, which to me is a buying opportunity. ESPN doesnâ€™t appear to be the problem some expected. I bought The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS ) on July 3, 1997 and have held it to this day. Here's why I think you want to buy it now. The newest DIS theme park will open in Shanghai in a couple weeks extending the Happiest Place on Earth brand further into China. Given the price movement of the stock in the last few weeks, I think that right now would be a good time to add DIS to long-term portfolios (I will be buying the October 100 calls after this article is published). I also think you definitely want to own DIS before they report 3 rd quarter 2016 earnings on August 9 th. Before I discuss the fundamentals and what, in my opinion, will drive earnings higher through 2017, let's look at what's going on right now. When DIS reported 2nd quarter 2016 earnings on May 10 th, they missed analysts' expectations by $0.04. The result is that the stock is off by more than 7% since then. As you pick through the numbers of the earnings statement you see increases in every business segment except DIS's Cable Networks and their Consumer Products & Interactive Media businesses. Interestingly, it does not appear that ESPN is the problem. This is important because it has been a concern of analysts for almost a year now. The decrease in cable revenue appears to be related to lower spending by advertisers on A&E. The weakness in Consumer Products & Interactive Media comes from every multi-national's nemesis, a stronger dollar, and plain-old bad results at Disney Infinity. There's not much DIS can do about the strong dollar, but they did announce plans to get rid of Infinity . In my opinion cable won't present a long-term problem for DIS (and so, it appears that neither will Infinity). The reason I am not concerned about DIS's cable business long-term is because of comments made by Chairman & CEO Bob Iger at the Deutsche Bank 2016 Media, Internet & Telecom Conference , where he told participants that DIS will "continue to focus less on cable growth and more on monetizing DIS's established brands across other platforms" (kinda like what Walt did when he opened Disneyland in 1955). Now, with that said, it is well to point out here that in the first quarter, DIS acquired Vice , a cable property that targets millennials. So, my sense is that cable growth will continue to contribute to revenues and operating income in a meaningful way for years to come. But, let's get back to the idea of monetizing established brands across other platforms, as this really is the strategic focus for DIS's long-term growth. I believe that the new park in Shanghai plays into this strategy and that DIS will benefit from continual growth of the middle class throughout the region. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), real growth in Emerging Asia is projected to average 6.2% annually through 2020. This could translate into a whole lot of new " Mouse Ears " being sold! The DIS franchise worldwide continues to expand and it's my expectation that we'll see further acquisition of established media brands that DIS will be able to exploit for decades to come. Consider the recent past. In 2006 DIS acquired Pixar. In 2009, they bought Marvel (Captain America, etc.). And, in 2012 it was Lucasfilm. Each of these brands contributes to licensing revenue as well as providing opportunities for film after film. In just the next 18 months DIS will be "monetizing established brands" in the following movies. "Finding Dory" (remember Nemo?) out this June 17 th. "Pete's Dragon" will be released on August 12 th. And, just in case you're not already tuned in to all things Star Wars, "Rogue One" will be out on December 16 th. Now, bear in mind, this is not a complete list of DIS releases this year. The total is closer to 10. And the list of new movies based on recognized "brands" goes on and on into 2017 and beyond. Next March DIS will release a live action version (that means a movie with real people, instead of cartoon characters) of "Beauty and the Beast". There will be yet another Star Wars movie out in May of 2017 (cha-ching!). Next June, we'll get another "Toy Story" movie. After that another "Pirates of the Caribbean" film will be released in July. And, then "Mary Poppins Returns" for Christmas 2018. So, clearly DIS has a well thought out plan to keep the franchise fresh with a cadre of characters that are older than Bob Iger! So, what do we have to pay for the potential all of this brings to the table? On a trailing basis DIS trades at about 18 times earnings. I think this compares favorably to the S&P 500's current 24 multiple. Granted, it's not a "value" stock. And, DIS does trade a little higher than its peer group, which Zack's pegs at just above 16.3 times trailing earnings. But, when you look at forward earnings, DIS is trading at a flat 16 multiple. If DIS has a positive earnings surprise in the next couple quarters, the multiple is very likely to shrink. All-in-all, I am completely okay paying 18 times trailing earnings for a company whose EPS have grown at a CAGR of 14.22% for the last five years! Finally, while it's not huge, I do like the $1.42 dividend DIS pays and I think that long-term investors can be confident in the income stream. DIS has paid a dividend every year without interruption since 2000 and has increased the payout seven times since then. I like DIS in the current price range (down about 7.5% from the date earnings were issued last month). I have every expectation that the stock will rebound to at least that level by the end of the year. But, DIS is in my opinion a must own long-term. ESPN seems to be on solid ground and Vice looks like it was a well thought out acquisition. So, I am confident that cable operations will continue to perform well. I expect Shanghai Disneyland to start adding incremental fuel to earnings this year and well into the future. And, I find the pipeline for potential hits at the box office very encouraging. DIS is a buy. When I bought it in 1997 the view was to hold it 'til my heirs had to figure out what to do with it. Hopefully they won't have to for a good long time!
