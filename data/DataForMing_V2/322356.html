Ford And General Motors Have Become Too Cheap To Ignore - Cramer's Lightning Round (2/17/16) | Seeking Alpha CarMax (NYSE: KMX ): Both CarMax and AutoNation (NYSE: AN ) are highly oversold. Cramer thinks that Ford (NYSE: F ) and General Motors (NYSE: GM ) have become too cheap after this industry has been overly hated. Carlyle Group (NASDAQ: CG ): When the IPO market opens up, everyone will wish they had not sold Carlyle. Blackstone (NYSE: BX ) has a similar case. Don't give up. WhiteWave Foods (NYSE: WWAV ): The stock is doing well and Cramer thinks it will go higher. He has been buying it for his charitable trust. Universal Display (NASDAQ: OLED ): It is valued richly, but they have got the correct technology. Cramer is backing it. HCP (NYSE: HCP ): Their 8% yield is a red flag. Stay away. American Water Works (NYSE: AWK ): It's a reliable and good company but yields only 2%. The stock has to come down for the yield to be good enough.
