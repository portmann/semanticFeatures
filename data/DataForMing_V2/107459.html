Consider Tata Motors While Everyone Else Is Considering Ford And GM - Tata Motors Limited (NYSE:TTM) | Seeking Alpha Shares of Tata Motors have cratered this year. Shares of Tata Motors (NYSE: TTM ) have dropped by over 20% this year, leaving shares unloved but not unforgotten. I've been watching Ford (NYSE: F ) as a potential investment, which led me to stumble upon the Indian automaker and owner of Jaguar/Land Rover. At a quick superficial glance, Tata appears to have a solid margin of safety baked into its shares. Now I'd like to analyze it and see if the discount is there for a reason, or if shares truly are a bargain. Tata Motors boasts ROE nearly double that of Ford and General Motors (NYSE: GM ). Below I've constructed a Dupont analysis to gain some more clarity as to what exactly is driving its ROE. We can see that ROE has been trending downward, dragged down by lower margins, weaker utilization of assets, and less financial leverage. GM's operating margins have been a little lumpy, so it's hard to compare, but 3% margin seems normal for the auto industry. Ford's operating margin is usually in that ball park as well. Tata Motors is arguably more complex than GM and Ford, and while it is primarily an automaker at heart, it also deals in industrial and marine engines, spare parts such as axles and transmissions, ATV's, and even construction equipment, just to name a few of its other lines of business. Due to its international sprawl, it's also been hit with negative currency impacts, which drained Rs19,104 (in millions) from the company. That's about $318.9 (in millions) when measured in dollars. With China appearing to show a possible slowdown economically, this could dent Tata's results going forward as well. Europe also accounts for a quarter of sales. Tata's capital structure looks healthy at an initial glance, with adequate working capital, as indicated by its current ratio a tad over 1. Looking at its efficiency in managing its cash, it also looks solid: TTM Days Sales Outstanding (Annual) data by YCharts We can see that the company maintains a negative cash conversion cycle (DSO + DIO - DPO), largely because it takes a long time to pay suppliers. The company's optimal CCC makes me think that the current ratio is just about right for the company and efficiency is very good. Turning to solvency ratios, we can see that despite a high debt to equity ratio, the company's overall capital structure looks solid and is on par with GM's, and maybe even slightly better than Ford's. TTM Debt to Equity Ratio (Annual) data by YCharts It should also be noted that most automakers have higher-than-normal debt to equity ratios because of financing activities. In this way they are similar to banks when looking at some solvency ratios. All-in-all, the company's financial condition looks healthy. Tata Motors is beaten down, but the company itself looks healthy. I think shares offer lots of value, but also contain lots of risk and probably lots of volatility as well. Morningstar seems to agree, giving the stock a coveted 5 star rating, explaining that its underlying results were "better than [the] market realizes". The company's crown jewel, Jaguar/Land Rover, is firing on all cylinders. JLR is growing revenues at a 40% compound annual rate, and accounts for almost half of overall vehicle sales. Morningstar also noted its impressive ROIC of 26%. It also does a lot of business in China, and with Europe looking a little shaky as well, it definitely has some geographical sales risks. The stronger dollar may continue to throw water on results, too, but on the flip side, emerging markets are expected to grow faster over the long-term. As an investment, Tata gives you a ticket to the growing middle classes of these countries. So if you're bargain hunting in the auto sector, consider Tata Motors at 7.7 times forward earnings. It's cheaper than Ford (9.35 times forward earnings) and on par with GM (7.4 times forward earnings). It should also be noted that GM and Ford pay substantial dividends around 4%, so they may be a better option for more conservative investors. For more aggressive investors, more risk usually brings the potential for more reward, however, and JLR should continue to drive growth at a solid clip for the overall company going forward. Just know what you're getting into and don't buy it for the tiny dividend. It's a speculative, value-based capital appreciation play. It's also a third option to consider if you're already looking into GM and/or Ford.
