Shares fell precipitously on September 23rd as an analyst note and other rumors cited the potential loss of the Verizon contract. The Verizon contract was recently renewed and expanded and obligates Verizon through 2018 with increased volumes as of May. On September 23rd, Synchronoss Technologies (NASDAQ: SNCR ) saw its share price decline by ~12% as investors fret about the potential loss of the Verizon contract. This presents investors a great long opportunity as the rumors are just rumors and the contract is still in force until 2018. Meanwhile, we think investors have been focusing on potential contract losses, buyout rumors , and other non-issues while missing the business model shift towards SaaS and an asset-lite, low-capital intensive business. That shift, along with substantial, scalable international expansion, should drive top line growth and expand margins over the next two years driving valuation. Synchronoss is a platform which, through their Activation Services, Synchronoss Personal Cloud, and Synchronoss Workspace technology, helps to automate the activation and provisioning of carriers, retailers, e-retailers and other connected device vendors. The company typically gets paid per transaction as consumers change carriers or activate a completely new mobile number and can do it for a fraction of what it costs the carriers. More recently, the company has been turning into a platform-as-a-service as they are at the center of a derivative play on wireless device growth in addition to an enabler of cloud platform solutions for carriers. The firm's technology has become integral and their new cloud services for customer content is helping to reduce churn with value-added services. Essentially, the company generates revenue by the activation fee business on a per transaction basis along with monthly subscription fees per active Personal Cloud subscriber under an SaaS business model. While it has become old news by now, the company purchased F-Secure Personal Cloud for $60 million in cash. The business fits nicely into the AT&T (NYSE: T ) Cloud Puzzle as F-Secure is one of the key vendors behind that Personal Cloud offering, the AT&T Locker. This is just one of a series of acquisitions including Voxmobil's Network Address Book, in addition to their launch of Mobile Content Transfer solution, which is allowing the company to make significant progress towards a complete Cloud penetration with AT&T and solution offering globally. We think the acquisition quickly moves them to expanding the company's personal cloud solution into major global markets while consolidating their position in AT&T's personal cloud which should help the amount of revenue derived from the relationship. At the end of 2014, the company had 130 million subscribers to its cloud solutions and is adding to that total by as much as half a million per week. The current penetration rate is still under 4% which we think provides a substantial runway for growth going forward. Given the proliferation of data usage, we believe the cloud storage service is going to only accelerate in its growth trajectory significantly benefiting Synchronoss as customers want to have more content available on their wireless devices at a moment's notice. Cloud Solutions rose to 46% of company revenue in fiscal 2014 and should be more than half in fiscal 2015. This Cloud Platform is what the company calls the Integrated Life platform- which unlocks new growth and diversity for the company. The company generates much lower churn rates of 0.25% to 0.50% on average compared to the industry standard of 1% to 2% or more. Synchronoss also sees a higher number of connected devices per account, which helps to create that stickiness and lower churn. Lastly, we think the fact that they are device and carrier agnostic provides a competitive advantage allowing the subscriber to pick the best device and operator for them instead of having to vertically align by device or operating system. The company has shifted their activation solutions to focus on global growth. The product is highly scalable and repeatable in any market as the technology is largely the same. In 2014, they achieved significant global expansion with many major carriers including Vodaphone in Europe and Reliance, Axiata, and Telkom Indonesia in Asia. There is still significant white space to add new carriers to their activation platform and diversify away from large customer bases. In addition, we think Personal Cloud growth is set to grow spectacularly internationally, especially in Asia, Latin America, and Eastern Europe. Emerging markets are a large opportunity for the company as they can offer a white label product which has integrated, end-to-end and value-add solutions for operators and regional solutions providers for limited cost. But we think the Internet of Things opportunity is where the greatest growth potential lay. The company should be able to pull more types of activation for home, car, and wearables and diversify their revenue base. This is a long-term call option outside of their Integrated Life platform which we think could add significant revenue drivers at high margins. The rumor mill is swirling today with several differing theories of what is going on. For one, some are saying that Synchronoss was losing Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) as a cloud customer and others saying that Verizon was in the process of changing their pricing options on Cloud services within their More Everything plan. However, we think both reports are unfounded or a complete overreaction. In terms of the loss of Verizon contract, the company recently renewed and expanded the relationship with Synchronoss earlier this year and is contractually committed through September 2018. In addition, the recently expanded contract laid out a doubling of the minimum committed transactional volume stream compared to the prior contract as Verizon plans to support video and their Fios business as well as other non-smartphone devices with the Verizon Cloud. The primary issue though appears to be Verizon's change of the amount of free storage for More Everything subscribers. Previously, it was 25gb and new users are now being capped at 5gb. But current More Everything subscribers are grandfathered into their free 25gb storage. The reason these rumors consider this a negative is the belief that this is the first in a series of moves to eliminate Synchronoss and go to other storage providers. One can simply go to Verizon Wireless and see the free storage changes and that it does not affect existing plan subscribers. Other rumors that are being floated is the loss of Verizon for their activation services. If that occurs, it would definitely hit earnings but at this point it's just a rumor and now the shares are pricing in at least some of that potential loss. Additionally, the company continues to diversify their customer base through international growth, which we highlighted earlier. Thus, the hit from one large customer loss would be mitigated, at least partially. Lastly, activation services continues to decline in importance for the company and is going to fall below 50% of consolidated revenue this year. We think this is a massive over-reaction to a rumor as no press release has been issued and no news (other than the stock price move) has come out today. As we noted above, the company is contractually committed with Verizon through 2018, so any loss beyond that is a long way off. Between now and then we expect the company could add significant global carriers while growing their cloud offering substantially by that time. Valuation by any metric today is absurdly cheap given the sell-off in the shares and the potential growth prospects. The market is clearly pricing in a large loss of a key customer, which we highlighted above is highly unlikely. As the company shifts towards the Cloud solutions offering, the business will transition towards an asset-lite model which should help expand EBITDA margins. In addition, as the company also focuses R&D efforts on more automation within its activation activities, which has traditionally been more capital intensive, it should also lower capital requirements and expand margins. We think the business is on the verge of some significant margin improvement firm-wide through these initiatives. EBITDA margins hit 27.1% in fiscal 2014 and should grow to the mid-30% this year on the above noted trends. We believe by the end of fiscal 2016, the company will be achieving EBITDA margins in excess of 40% on the low-end and 45% on the high. We used a 10x multiple on that EBITDA growth which is a substantial discount to the expected growth rate of 22.5% by the sell-side. Even if EBITDA grows at half that rate, the shares are cheap and the multiple we used is a discount with a margin of safety. The sell-off in the shares on September 23rd was a completely unjustified move due to rumors of the potential loss of Verizon as a customer. We think this is unfounded and that the current share price embeds a significant portion of that contract being lost. However, as we noted above, Synchronoss and Verizon recently renewed their contract and expanded it, which would belie the notion that Verizon was exploring other options. Meanwhile, investors are ignoring the potential growth opportunities within the integrated life platform, the Internet of Things potential, and the margin expansion story which is taking shape across the entirety of the firm through a business model shift. We think this is a golden opportunity to go long the shares with significant upside potential using very conservative multiple assumptions.
