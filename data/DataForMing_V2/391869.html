Fitbit Shares: The Reaction After Apple Watch Sales Deterioration - Fitbit, Inc. (NYSE:FIT) | Seeking Alpha FIT shares pressured by Apple Watch sales forecast and sequential declines. Apple's Other categorical sales decline 50% sequential as Apple Watch sell-through deteriorates. In a previous article titled " Fitbit Shares 'Surge' On Positive Analysts Updates " I offered Fitbit (NYSE: FIT ) investors to consider that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) would be reporting results in the coming weeks. The reason for this offering is that the Apple Watch results will be on display for investor consideration. With the undeniable and demonstrated understanding that Apple Watch sales were declining sequentially and significantly, this could impact shares of FIT even if for a moment. Here's the excerpt from my article as follows: While the two products do compete for the same space on the consumer's wrist, they will likely be pared in the minds of investors going forward as well. Within that context, FIT investors and traders would benefit from reviewing Apple's quarterly transcript for details on the Apple Watch as they may serve to "boom or bust" FIT shares if ever so briefly." As has been the case, this forewarning held true with shares of FIT falling by greater than 3% after hours yesterday and on the heels of Apple Inc. reporting its Q2 2016 results. While some may not realize the actual Watch sales numbers because Apple lumps them into the "Other" category, it is known that Watch has contributed the greatest sales growth for this Apple category since launching in April of 2015. In Q1 of 2016, Other sales, grew by 62% YOY and 43% sequentially. Total category sales were $4.35bn during the Q1 2016 period. But the situation coming out of Apple Inc.'s holiday period became significantly worse. In the Q2 2016 period, Other sales grew by only 30% and declined a whopping 50% sequentially . Total category sales were only $2.1bn during the Q2 2016 period. This signaled that Apple Watches sold during the holiday period were replenished to a greater degree than can currently be sold to consumers. Keep in mind that Apple reduced the Apple Watch price during the holiday period, and not surprisingly, has been forced to reduce the price recently due to negative sales at retail locations. Watch sales are expected to be very seasonal, with ~40% coming in calendar Q4. IDC estimates Watch shipments totaled 11.6M in 2015. I would be of the opinion that IDC will be forced to review their forecast for smart watches going forward given the severe drop off in Apple Watch sales. I had forewarned investors in the past that IDC estimates would not be realized for smart watches or fitness trackers long term. Like Apple Inc., Fitibit is a hardware company first and foremost. Despite the media hype behind the company's brand and product deployment into the marketplace, hardware companies rarely achieve high multiples. Growth wanes and eventually results in sweeping metric declines when hardware companies brush up against realizing their total addressable market (TAM). This is the present situation for Apple. There was never any secret as to why AAPL shares never really achieved a strong multiple even after years of growth and innovation. There was only the failure to accept the company was little more than a hardware company, like Fitbit. To further example the relative valuation and impact from Apple's latest quarterly results, GoPro (NASDAQ: GPRO ) shares also are trading lower in the pre-market trading session. So with shares of Fitbit trading off their closing price during the after-hours trading session yesterday, an opportunity may be at hand to scoop up shares of FIT should they remain pressured during regular trading hours in the coming days. Fitbit will find itself in the same situation that Apple Inc. and the Apple Watch find themselves, but that will come through time and market saturation. And that time is many months away. As I've said many a time in the past, prices for shares of FIT will likely expand and contract within channels before ultimately breaking to the upside and inevitably plunging post market saturation and sales declining. The market is a very rational place with the understanding of why events occur and how these events can be monetized to the benefit of the investor/trader. Regardless of Apple's current dilemma related to market saturation, Fitbit still has the ability to expand its distribution reach and product line. This will lead to near-term revenue and earnings growth and support higher FIT prices as well. Where retailers have been duped by the Apple brand image in their decision to support sales of the Apple Watch, they have yet to realize or accept the sell-through deceleration of Fitbit products. When they do and when Fitbit products are found to have saturated the marketplace, retailers will adjust their buying and inventory of Fitbit products strategy. Until then FIT shares are likely a good buy on meaningful dips. I'm not a willing buyer in the $17 range as I recently sold shares for $17 and would desire to buy them back significantly lower. Today will be an interesting day for FIT shares as it will be a good way for investors and traders alike to see how or if Apple Watch's shortcomings pervade the share price.
