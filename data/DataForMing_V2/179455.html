ETF Hub Sep 22 2015, 12:46 ET | About: Verizon Communications (VZ) | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Traffic checks of U.S. wireless carriers by Pacific Crest's Michael Bowen show slowness for the leaders and some momentum for challengers . Verizon ( VZ -1%) was "slow" and AT&T ( T -0.9%) "somewhat weak" in the past month heading into a key iPhone announcement. Verizon saw a lower amount of pre-orders for the iPhone and was coming off a data plan re-sizing ; AT&T is lower-key about pushing phone upgrades, though tablet promotions are going well and customers are responding to DirecTV bundles. Meanwhile, promotions are bearing fruit at T-Mobile ( TMUS -1.9%) and Sprint ( S -1%). T-Mobile traffic was "strong," Bowen says, with employees optimistic about iPhone pre-orders and new financing plans. Meanwhile, most Sprint stores met or beat August goals and expect the same for September, as the "iPhone forever" leasing plan is showing strong demand. These promotions can't last forever.
