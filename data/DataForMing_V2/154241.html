Apple Should Take Advantage Of Rate Pullback - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Last time we saw this was late April / early May. A couple of weeks ago, I wondered who would blink first when it came to Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ): Tim Cook or Carl Icahn? Shares dropped after the company's earnings report, and fell below the key 200-day moving average on fears of an economic slowdown in China. Apple shares are still about 10% off their pre-earnings levels, and another key number is coming down. If management truly believes in this company's future, this would seem like the perfect opportunity for Apple to make a move. What key number am I talking about? Well, I'm referencing US treasury rates. As you will see in the chart below, the 30-year has seen its yield pull back more than 40 basis points from 3.25%. Last week's 2.76% low point was the lowest yield for the long bond since late April. We've also seen the 10-year yield drop a bit. Back in early May, Apple came out and issued $8 billion worth of dollar-denominated bonds. With US rates rising afterward, it looked like good timing on the company's part. Apple has issued other bonds since then, but they were yen and pound bonds, not US dollar ones. Those two foreign issuances also were a lot smaller than the US-based one. US rates have come down in recent weeks as chances of a September US Federal Reserve rate hike have decreased . With China fears spreading over the Yuan devaluation plus some weak US economic data, calls for a rate hike have been pushed back. While I'm sure that homeowners will love lower mortgage rates, US firms like Apple that use debt for stock repurchases should be happy too. One item I find interesting is the lack of changes in analyst estimates . We keep hearing all of this negativity regarding Apple and the slowdown in China. However, after the initial Q4 revenue drop from $51.14 billion to $50.85 billion (due to Apple's guidance at its most recent report), the revenue average has ticked back up to $50.91 billion. If the Street was really concerned, you would expect to see estimates dropping. That's not the case, and the current average is just below the top end of Apple's guidance. According to page 17 of the company's most recent 10-Q filing , Apple paid over $124 in the last two quarters to buy back $11 billion worth of stock. If management was that willing to purchase shares then, you would think it would salivate over the chance to buy shares at $115. Additionally, the stock's dividend yield is now over 1.80%, and the next 12 months could yield more than that with a dividend raise in early 2016. A large part of Apple's debt issuances has been short-term maturity debt. These issues could carry interest rates that make it attractive for Apple to buy back stock. The company could recognize a cash flow savings because it would save money on dividend payments, more so than its interest costs. I still think Apple is a good buy for long-term investors, and these are the critical points I'd highlight now: We still have a huge upgrade base from 5S/5C/China Mobile early customers who want larger screen phones, which should lead to a solid refresh cycle. The "S" refresh generally leads to higher margins for Apple. New products/services like the Apple Watch, a larger screen iPad, and Apple Music will start to generate significant revenues in the coming quarters. Apple's Mac business continues to show strong growth in the face of PC industry weakness. A strong capital return plan, highlighted by a massive buyback and decent dividend yield. Apple is currently about a month away from the release of its next iPhone. While shares are off their recent lows, they are still down 10% since the earnings report. US interest rates are back down to levels we saw right before Apple's last large dollar denomination debt issuance, so the company might want to step in again and sell more bonds. If you see a filing from the company, it probably means management is looking to step in and buy shares, which would be a good buy signal.
