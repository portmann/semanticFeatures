Intel And Micron: Stock Prices Are In The Doldrums For Good Reason - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel’s predicted earnings miss caused the price to fall about 10%. Micron’s stock fell 5% in sympathy with Intel. I have been a sharp critic of Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) ( here and here ) and somewhat of Micron (NASDAQ: MU ) ( here ). Some people think they both have great promise for breakthrough technology, especially in 3D NAND. Some think they are part of oligopolies (Intel PC desktop and servers, Micron memory) and therefore deserve a premium PE ratio. And some think they are being held back because people do not really understand them and more explanation of their potential is needed. In this article, I will explain why I think Mr. Market is right on the money so to speak. "From the bluff head where I watch'd to-day, I saw her in the doldrums; for the wind Was light and baffling." Lord Byron Intel and Micron are two of the favorite stocks on SA. Since March 10, Intel has had 15 articles written about it and Micron seven. And oftentimes, a given article on one of the stocks will mention the other one. Of course, since they have a JV (joint venture) to build NAND, that should probably be expected. If we look at their stock prices over the last 10 months, you can see they usually follow one another in the same direction, although being more volatile, MU tends to have more amplitude for a given price movement. But the big kicker is the third line on the chart - the Dow Jones U.S. Semiconductor Index, which for the first time in over a year is higher than both INTC and MU. Some might consider that a buy signal. Just today (03/17/2015) RBC downgraded MU to $40 from $44 a day after Deutsche Bank said FQ3 estimates are probably coming down. The current Nasdaq earnings estimate for Intel is brutal with 16 downgrades and only 1 upgrade. Micron is not nearly as bad but still there appears to be little enthusiasm in the market for MU. Good news always seem to be down the road a bit In Intel's January CC alone, there are 14 mentions of "2nd half" or "back half" by Intel CEO Brian Krzanich (BK) and CFO Stacy Smith (SS). Here's a sampling: LTE version would be in the first half of next year." We are growing below the market in terms of bits" Wouldn't expect to have tools running in the new space until more like 2017." So INTC and MU are saying to Mr. Market "first half is kind of sluggish but the second half and beyond are gangbusters" and Mr. Market is saying "I think I will wait and see." That's really all there is to the lack of upward pricing in these two stocks. Various other reasons stock prices are down for INTC and MU Intel needs to limit contra-revenue going forward and this seems problematic at best. Samsung's ( OTC:SSNLF ) competition in DRAM and 3D NAND is worrisome to investors. Are ARM processors a threat to Intel's server and desktop dominance? Can Micron be underperforming in NAND right now but overperform in the future? Ivan Donaldson: "We have been underperforming overall in the NAND segments off late." So at these depressed prices why doesn't Intel just buy Micron? I think most Micron shareholders would jump at the chance to get a quick $40 a share in exchange for some cash and Intel stock. And $40 would only be about 10x MU 2015 earnings. The combined $70 billion company would be a monster with about $15 billion in capex and could provide most of the content for any given device. And with their size, they would be the new bully on the block, and could kick sand in the face of Samsung or anyone else who might challenge them. And if they moved the headquarters to Boise, then management of Intel might quit and we would solve that problem too. When it comes to Intel and Micron, Mr. Market is now from Missouri and needs to be "shown" rather than "told" how good things are going to be. So it will be slow going for their stock price until one or the other or both actually show some of the production and especially profits that they have been talking about for the last year or so. I would not be in a hurry to buy either stock right now. Why not wait until the second or, better yet, the third quarter conference calls to see if the future they predict now actually comes to pass? You might lose a bit of upside but predictability and clarity would allow plenty of upside with little risk.
