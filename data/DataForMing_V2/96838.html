What Would Amazon.com Without AWS Look Like? - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Rumors about a possible AWS spin-off moved Amazon.com stock. I built a model showing how Amazon.com's P&L would look without AWS. It doesn't seem likely that Amazon.com would want the market to see such a P&L. Thus, I believe the rumors are bogus. There was a rumor today which got Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ) moving. The rumor was that Amazon.com might spin-off AWS. While such an event is not impossible, I must say that the rumor alleging "unconfirmed chatter" is likely to be false. Indeed, any rumor mentioning "chatter" is probably false. Lately the market seems filled with these false rumors which are used to prop up stocks, just like the wave of rumors mentioning salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM ) as a possible acquisition target. Anyway, what if it wasn't false? How would Amazon.com's P&L look like if AWS was really spun-off? I might be able to provide an approximation. This is so because in Q1 2015 Amazon.com reported AWS separately, so with a few realistic assumptions, we can try to guess how AMZN would look like without AWS being present. I will remove AWS as per its performance over 2014. This includes large price reductions around Q2 2014 which took its CSOI (Consolidated Segment Operating Profit) lower than it would otherwise have been. However, since AWS might be near to having to implement new price cuts, the assumption is not that unrealistic. Technology and content, where all of AWS's costs reside, also includes other costs which would remain part of Amazon.com ex-AWS. In the 4 years to 2006, before AWS existed, these costs ran around 4.7% of sales (this can be seen in my article " Amazon.com: The Lack Of Profitability Is Structural "). Around $0.65 billion of content costs (0.7% of sales). These didn't exist back in 2002-2005. This warrants an explanation. Jeff Bezos has said Amazon.com invested $1.3 billion in Prime video during 2014, but investing it is not the same as expensing it. The content is not bought for a sole year, it runs over several, so I can't use the $1.3 billion directly - using 2 years as a proxy gives us $650 million at most. Now, how will I split the $804 million in SBC Amazon.com reported as being included in technology and content for 2014? Well, content costs don't compete for SBC, so I just need to see what's the weight of AWS on AWS+"Amazon.com ex-AWS and content". This comes to 51.3%, so AWS gets awarded 51.3% of the SBC, or $412.5 million. Now that we have a realistic set of assumptions, we can see how they fit the existing data. Over 2014, AWS had: AWS Operating Profit: $4644 million - $4425 million = $219 million AWS Operating profit using CSOI and SBC: $660 million - $412.5 million = $247.5 million As we can see, the fit seems pretty close. The difference between both measures is just $28.5 million or just 0.6% of AWS revenues. The assumptions are thus probably realistic. Using the assumptions above, here's how AWS and Amazon.com ex-AWS P&Ls would look like for 2014 (I won't go below income from operations as that will greatly depend on how Amazon.com would allocate debt): There are two main conclusions to be drawn from this exercise: Also, since AWS is presently accounted for at 100% gross margins and is the fastest growing segment of Amazon.com, taking it away would take away a large component that's driving the perceived gross margins higher. I have already written about this misleading effect . This wouldn't remove all of the effect because 3P (Third-Party) sales would remain, but it would greatly diminish the impact. Both of these effects argue against Amazon.com separating AWS. Even if AWS was separated at a $60 billion valuation, the whole of Amazon.com would still retain a massive $150 billion market capitalization - supported by lower growth, without most of the gross margin myth and carrying negative operating margins. There should be tremendous pressure from investment banks to do this operation because of all the fees it would generate. But for Amazon.com, the end result would look very ugly, so it isn't likely that Jeff Bezos will be convinced. Source: What Would Amazon.com Without AWS Look Like? Disclosure: I am/we are short AMZN.
