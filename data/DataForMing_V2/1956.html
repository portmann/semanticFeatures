Live Action 'Cinderella' Helping Disney Find Second Life For Fairy Tale Franchises - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha â€˜Cinderellaâ€™ is expected to top the box office with a sizable amount and help get Hollywood back on track. Disney has a number of popular franchises but as of late has figured out a new way to extend the life of closed-ended favorites. â€˜Cinderellaâ€™ is the latest example of Disney finding a way to mine its vault by creating live action versions of its iconic animated films. After two weeks of films topping the box office with "so-so" totals, Hollywood is about to get back on track thanks to a spell cast by who else but Disney (NYSE: DIS ). The house the mouse built is storming back into theaters this weekend with Cinderella, a live action retelling of the classic fairy tale. Now, I'll be honest, when I see early estimates begin to pop a few (short of American Sniper) really take me by surprise…this one did. Early tracking on Cinderella has the film in the $55 million to $60 million range and that's impressive for a tale literally as old as time. And speaking of Beauty and the Beast, that is the next Disney film to get the live action treatment with Dumbo (shockingly) getting greenlit this week as well. As you're reading this, keep in mind there have been 13 adaptations of Cinderella since 2000, so why is this one different? Because it's Disney! No, Disney didn't invent the Cinderella story, but it did perfect it and it's evolving it again here. This also isn't the first time it's happened , look at Alice In Wonderland which with Tim Burton in control turned into a profitable live-actioner back in 2010 and last year saw Sleepy Beauty re-imagined through the eyes of the villain Maleficent. This time is a little different though as unlike Alice you don't have a director like Burton and unlike Maleficent you don't have an Angelina Jolie-type star in the lead. In addition, unlike the other films this one is a more faithful re-telling, though it does enhance and focus on certain areas of the narrative previously undeveloped and that's part of why it works. Although with that said, let's look at what you do have…a very capable director in actor-turned-helmer Kenneth Branagh who helped launch Marvel's Thor franchise and the darling Lily James who broke through on Downton Abbey. Now here's the big reason why this is going to work and a big reason why Disney gambled on it to succeed in the first place; its budget . This was a nice test for Disney as unlike Alice and Maleficent which both cost upwards of $200 million, Cinderella was produced for (a modest by comparison) $95 million and it could easily hit as high levels of profit. So what does this mean for Disney? Well it adds yet another franchise to a list that already includes everything Marvel and Star Wars. Disney has realized they can mine their vault and put a new-ish spin on old close-ended faves and still turn a large profit. Remember when Disney realized it could convert their animated hits like Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King into 3D and make a ton of money? It's the same thing here, hence the upcoming Beauty and the Beast adaptation with Harry Potter's Emma Watson and Downton Abbey's Dan Stevens in the lead roles and the yet to be cast Dumbo (which with Tim Burton returning to direct has the potential to scar small children and certain adults). If I'm looking at Disney from an investor perspective though I'm happy and I'll tell you why…if you ranked all of the studio's 2015 films in order of anticipation and expected profit, Cinderella and her glass slipper don't even hit the top 5. That's a company with a roster worth watching. Remember, Disney also has Marvel's The Avengers: Age of Ultron and Ant-Man, Pixar's Inside Out and The Good Dinosaur and oh yeah, Star Wars: The Force Awakens slated for the remainder of the year. That's not even including the heavily buzzed about Brad Bird/Damon Lindelof/George Clooney collaboration Tomorrowland which will also cause cash registers to open come May. Together this is a powerful slate that next to Universal's stellar list of sequels and spin-offs (including Fast & Furious, Jurassic Park, Pitch Perfect, Ted and Despicable Me) is untouchable. Pay attention to what Cinderella does this weekend because its domestic total will be just the start as its international run will likely be even more successful…as if the studio needed more money.
