Apple: Who Blinks First? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple shares falling after breaking below 200-day moving average. Will we hear from Tim Cook or Carl Icahn first? After a decent but not great earnings report, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) shares sold off, and they've extended those losses this week after breaking below the key 200-day moving average. With shares more than $21 off their 52-week high at Tuesday's low, I would expect to hear something from either CEO Tim Cook or billionaire investor Carl Icahn soon. It was back in May that Carl Icahn came out and upped his Apple price target from $216 to $240. Icahn had a very rosy forecast for the company's earnings, based on some products (like the TV) that may not even come. He also believed that Apple should announce a larger buyback, even after the current program was increased by $50 billion earlier this year. With shares below $120 now, Apple would need to more than double to get to Icahn's price target. If Icahn really believes shares are worth that much, it wouldn't be a surprise for him to come out and detail how he added to his position. On the other hand, I'd rather hear from Apple CEO Tim Cook. It was back in February 2014 that the company's top man came out and detailed a large purchase of Apple shares. It was that support of the company's shares that helped to put a floor in Apple shares, and they've been higher ever since. The chart below shows this, and I put the red line in to show the floor. On a split-adjusted basis, that post-earnings pullback was about $10. The one we've seen in recent weeks is almost twice that (since the July 20th high). Remember, as Apple detailed on page 17 of its most recent 10-Q filing , the company spent $11 billion in the past two quarters on the buyback (open market purchases). The average cost of shares was about $125.53, $10 above where we are now. If management was readily willing to buy shares then, don't you think this would be an even better opportunity to do so? We've got about a month or so until Apple introduces its next iPhone(s), which will determine whether or not the company's smartphone growth continues. If management truly believes that its products will sell well, this pullback would seem to create a tremendous opportunity to buyback shares. Instead of waiting until the October report to detail repurchases, another announcement from Tim Cook would signal management believes shares are undervalued, and it would most likely put another floor in the stock. Given the recent pullback in Apple shares, I would expect to hear from Cook or Icahn rather soon. For investors' sake, I hope we hear from the man who runs the company.
