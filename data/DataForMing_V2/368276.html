40,000 Verizon Workers Go On Strike: How Will It Affect You | Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! Longer term the inflation adjusted 1980 high of $150/oz remains realistic â€“ especially given the increasing use of silver in various industrial application and silverâ€™s increasing investment demand... Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! Starting early today, over 36,000 Verizon workers will go on strike after the firm failed - after 8 months of 'negotiations' - to meet two union's demands (which merely includes controlling health care costs, protecting well-paying jobs and expanding the ranks of the workers who have them). The strike - one of the largest in years, according to NYTimes - will affect some consumers but Verizon has said that customers will be less impacted because it has trained thousands of non-union employees since last year to fill in for those who walk the picket line.   The employees, who work mostly on the company’s landline phone and Internet operations along the East Coast, have been working without a contract since August. The workers are represented by the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. In 2011, a strike lasted two weeks before a new contract was reached. The unions say they are trying to improve pension benefits and prevent Verizon from outsourcing jobs to contractors. The company, which has about 178,000 total employees, is looking to reduce retirement benefits and health-care costs. “We’ve worked hard in negotiations to find common ground, but working people at Verizon and across the country have had enough of the corporate greed that is destroying our families and our economy,” said CWA union official Dennis Trainor. Here’s a guide from NYTimes to which consumers may be affected, who won’t and how any disruption might manifest itself. The unions generally represent workers for Verizon’s wireline operations, which include the company’s landline, high-speed Internet and television services. These services are mostly available only in the Northeast, including Massachusetts, Rhode Island and the region from southern New York to Virginia. The unionized workers perform a range of tasks, like fixing a phone line that’s out of service, installing new phone and broadband Internet lines, or fielding customer support calls. Union workers say they plan to picket some Verizon Wireless stores, but only a small number of those employees are part of the unions. In other words, subscribers to Verizon’s cellular phone and data services should not notice any changes. There should be no major difference when you call Verizon Wireless or go into a retail store with questions about your cellphone bill, data usage or upgrading to a new smartphone, for example. Verizon says consumers need not worry about the potential strike. “We went through very extensive, good training and we’re very confident that we’re more than ready to meet the needs of our customers,” said Mr. McConville of Verizon. But judging from numbers alone, Verizon’s wireline customers can reasonably expect a deterioration in customer service quality. Even with preparation, the company said it has trained only upward of 10,000 employees to fill in for the nearly 36,000 workers who went on strike. In addition, many unionized workers who are striking have been doing this type of work for far longer than the one year that Verizon has trained nonunion workers to fill in. “There will almost certainly be some functions which may be slower or unavailable during the strike, because they require specialized skills or there just aren’t sufficient alternative resources available to fill all functions,” said Jan Dawson, an independent technology analyst for Jackdaw Research. Indefinitely. Verizon’s unionized workers have not specified how long they might go on strike, so it could last hours, days, weeks or even months. Mr. McConville said the strike would have no effect on consumers’ bills. Don't Americans have a right to wireline and wireless phone services? This strike seems very unpatriotic.

Have you now or ever been a CWA employee? Wed, 04/13/2016 - 12:01 | 7431418 NoDecaf yeah douche bag for 20 years.... so you sat your fat ass down at a desk for a short stint meanwhile I was ripping out D4 channel banks and replacing them with the newest stuff. I built the first FIOS system in NY state and worked every city from Buffalo to NYC. I know alot more about the physical layer than you could ever dream of. but fuck the company harder....fucking greedy bastards pulling in 1.8 billion in profits on our backs Wed, 04/13/2016 - 11:46 | 7431329 cheech_wizard I did a brief stint (during the great recession when there were 0 jobs) for AT&T working the phone banks for their DSL service. Long story short, after we debugged AT&T's new craptastic software written in India by people that couldn't spell English, we were let go. CWA union pukes kept their jobs even though the new hires were simply better at the job in terms of efficiency and technical knowledge. Heard of a press-gang? That is the CWA.  Standard Disclaimer: That was my one and only experience with a private sector union (CWA). FUCK THEM. Overpaid, worthless leeches, which goes a long way to explaining why our phone bills are so high. If you don't mind saying "Thank you for choosing _________" for the rest of your life as you grow fat in a chair, the pay isn't bad. ($14.25/hr to start, $22.50/hr after a year, and if you can fucking believe this $30/hr after 2 years. This was for the most technical non-engineering job at AT&T, which was basically their Internet DSL services.) But being in the union had some almost impossible rules. Seriously 2 5 minute bathroom breaks, 2 10 minute smoke breaks, and a half hour lunch break. Strictly monitored, and it was easy to get fired. Call in sick, or be late, was almost automatic termination. Other groups made a lot less, but then how hard is it to answer a phone and be pleasant to people that you don't care about.

Wed, 04/13/2016 - 11:32 | 7431226 TradingIsLifeBrah My guess is that this will impact businesses, those are the only people I can think of that might have a landline.  If its only residential then the Unions might have done Verizon a favor because Verizon may not need those workers back. all fiber optic backbone ROADM technology. WE the workers build this shit....the fucking walmart mentality workers in wireless storefronts sell packages and handsets....that's it Wed, 04/13/2016 - 11:57 | 7431400 cheech_wizard Again, you absolutely demonstrate you do not know what you are talking about. The last mile, not to mention a lot more of it is still copper. U-Verse - still copper to the premises. Internet DSL over land lines - copper again. Standard Disclaimer: Get back to me when it is all FTTP. (Fiber To The Premises) Now hush child, you're embarrassing yourself. Wed, 04/13/2016 - 11:49 | 7431353 More Ammo Stopped right there.  No impact on me (or most anyone, near as I can tell).  God forbid our landline phone system stops working. I can tell you that EVERY wireless call is carried by a landline. Wireless doesn't mean it magically flies through the air to the other phone. I would think that most ZHers are smart enough to realize that VZ is just a corporate extension of the govt. Sure the union is not filled with angels but in this case, the company is the greater evil. Wed, 04/13/2016 - 12:00 | 7431412 Emergency Ward Verizon has sold off large parts of their landline business to Frontier Comm (most recently the gargantuan California franchise).  Now they will "lease" the cell tower backhaul facilities instead of "owning" them. att (AT&T) is in the same situation.  They own the landlines in their franchised areas that feed the att cell towers.

Ended up in Milwaukee and worked as a garbage man. He lived through the unionizatin of the public workers in MKE during the depression. After one union meeting he came home and told my mother, "It's the Communists. I left them in 1914 and now they are here."
