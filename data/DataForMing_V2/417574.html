Buying This Dip In Microsoft A Smart Move - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft is striving to overcome the last top at $56. The company remains on a long-term uptrend for several years. I am going to identify Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) long-term trend. It is particularly important to define company's trend strength and find trend reversals while allowing the use of appropriate protective stops from a risk management perspective. It is decisive to keep in mind that technical analysis (TA) is the forecasting of price movements over time. Although it is not meant to be a precise prediction, TA can help investors anticipate future prices. Under normal conditions, share prices usually witness extended periods of trending, not random, fluctuation. The main task of an analyst is to find these large periods of trending prices which may be considered as major trends. As a technician my focus is only on Microsoft prices. Therefore, all information is always supposed to be discounted in the price. Let us begin with a 5-year daily chart of Microsoft. It seems obvious that a long-term trend is in place. One way to confirm this is to look to price levels relative to the 100-day EMA, 200-day EMA, and 300-day EMA. We can see on the chart below a well defined long-term trend as prices have stayed above those moving averages (with some exceptions with no real importance). In fact, true trend reversals don't seem to exist in spite of some relevant corrections. In more detail, we can watch on the weekly chart below the excellent support given by the 200-day EMA even in the complicated downturn of the last quarter of 2012. It has to be noted that the 50-day EMA is always above the 200-day EMA with the distance between them growing over the years. This is rather positive. Looking at the last 18 months it is clear that there are three extremely important price levels which are telling us what will probably happen to MSFT prices in the near future: - $39 was undoubtedly a strong support as it has kept prices higher in 2015. - $48 was a top over the past year which turned to be a support in 2016 when share prices rocketed to 56. Microsoft has found good support at the $50-$52 zone and is now prepared to challenge the top at $56 to continue higher. Last April MSFT shares have fallen suddenly showing a gap as we can see on the chart above. As prices appear to be well supported, buying this dip - and believing that the gap is closed - will be probably a good option. So, despite this last drop, the bullish case for MSFT shares seems well defended.
