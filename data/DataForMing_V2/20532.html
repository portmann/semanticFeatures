Ford (F) Presents at Bank of America Merrill Lynch 2015 New York Auto Summit (Transcript) | Seeking Alpha Next up we have Ford Motor Company, which we are very happy to have here at the keynote lunch position. It is one of the leading automakers, progressing well through a long transition; it's got a long way to go. Like a lot of other automakers, it did hit a few speed bumps last year with some recalls and some incremental costs from the F-150 launch, but that is going very well and now appears solidly on track to benefit the Company in the second half of this year. That launch, as well as many others on the horizon, continues to put forward at the top of the heap on refresh cycles and ultimately adjusted margins in North America. Now we are looking for the success to be repeated in other regions around the world where Ford is growing fairly rapidly, like China, and recovering in Europe and dealing with some of the stress in South America. We also are looking forward to how Ford will ultimately deal with their partners in the labor contract negotiations this summer with the UAW. I don't think we’ll get too much news on that today, but that’s an important thing to watch in the future. Today, we are very happy to have from Ford, Joe Hinrichs, Executive Vice President and President of the Americas. Joe, - I am sorry, Joe joined in December of 2000 at the Ford at the Van Dyke Transmission Plant in Sterling Heights, Michigan. But he has been in a number of positions at Ford, most – I think importantly is Group Vice President of Global Manufacturing and Labor Affairs and if you think about two things that are incredibly important about what’s going at Ford right now, it is manufacturing as they transition to fewer and fewer platforms and ramp up their global manufacturing efforts as well as the labor affairs that are on the horizon this summer. So, Joe has got not only great experience in his current position in the Americas, but knows a lot about some of the key issues that are going to be upcoming at Ford. And with that, I’d like to invite Joe Hinrichs to the stage. Thanks, John and good afternoon everyone. Enjoy your lunch please and we’ll get going. As John said, we are proud to be here today and thanks for the opportunity to have us. Let me talk a little bit about an update on where we are within the One Ford Plan, specifically in North America and South America which ultimately I am responsible for as President of the Americas. I’ll come back at the end, talk about our 2015 planning assumptions and key metrics and then give a few closing remarks and then of course valuable Q&A session at the end. So, give yourself time to think about those tough questions for John. As you know, our focus is to remain on our One Ford Plan. It served us well over the last several years. As Mark has come in, clearly one of the things we’ve talked about is accelerating our work around the world and the One Ford Plan that’s been the foundation of our business for a better part of – almost eight years now. We’ve been talking a lot about product excellence with passion. You saw that – I think you saw anything about the continental concept with Lincoln that we unveiled today and yesterday, and Monday throughout the week here in New York. And an important part of our business of course is innovation with what’s going on in the industry and what’s going on all around us and bringing that thinking around innovation every part of our business. So these are all the kind of our key focus areas that served us well and will serve us well. In September, at our Investor Day, we talked about our long-term objectives. These are consistent with what we showed in September and that is globally what we are trying to achieve and where we are working through to get to for the top five in sales, we are currently six as you probably know. Whether it’s a more balanced regional and segment profits, of course our strong business in North America, we want to keep that going while improving our business in other parts of the world, operating margins of 8% plus globally in – and great returns for our shareholders and then highly regard about all our stakeholders. It’s becoming more and more important in our industry, whether it’s partnerships, going on with suppliers or with others, even competitors, but also clearly with our union partners and governments, dealers, everyone are in the business. Remember, 2008, 2009, I certainly remember them well and with all the recession we did here in North America, but a great turnaround story as you know. We did get to 10 plus percentage margins in 2012 and 2013 with a record $8.8 billion profit in 2013. When you look at 2014, with a stronger industry, there are really two reasons why that number dropped to $6.9 billion. We signaled it was going to happen; it was a transition year for us. With 16 major launches in North America including the conversion of the F-150 and the lot production that went with that, and we also had about $1 billion worth of recalls last year which you are very familiar with. So when you add the transition in the F-150 and the recall, they kind of have an explanation for what happened in 2014. When we think of 2015 as a great opportunity and I’ll talk more about that in a little bit. But we’ve been very focused on watching our structural cost, watching the margins of our business while growing appropriately with the industry and with segmentation and very reliant upon our new products and whether it’s the F-150 or the Transit Van or the Mustang or other new products that we have coming into the marketplace. To keep that line-up fresh, which we want to be – if not the fresh, it’s one of the freshest in the industry in the showroom, which we know leads to good profitable growth. So our priorities in North America haven’t changed. If you heard me speak before in the last couple of years, these numbers – at least the word haven’t changed. We need to continue to deliver profitable growth. All three of those words are important for the delivery aspect, for the profit aspect and then as the growth aspect and we expect to have market share growth this year. We haven’t seen that yet in the first quarter because of the timing of our launches and of course, especially F-150, but also the Edge and the timing of where we are in that cycle. But we have great expectations for strength, especially in the second half of the year, when we get to full volume with our launches and our products. So we are working very hard and accelerating our quality improvements. I’ll talk a little bit about that. We are very pleased with the progress we are making there. Our develop and launch outstanding products, launch has been a big part of our business. Certainly, 16 launches in North America historic and record number for us in our 111 year history in that regard. But seven more launches in North America this year including important products like the Lincoln, MKX and the Ford Edge, the all new Edge and the Ford Explorer and the G-350, VVDR. Mustang and of course, not noted in that seven is the F-150 launch in Kansas City which is a sound launch and a big important part of our business. We are focusing a lot on the Lincoln brand a lot and we’ll talk a lot about that. We can talk more about that in a little bit and then controlling our cost as we grow our business which is historical then when the challenges in our industry is lot in the car space while our business is growing. If I look back of where the sales rates have been, in the last couple of years, we’ve seen tremendous growth as you know from 12 in the US from 2012 to 2013 to 2014, we had nearly a million or million plus unit growth. And we don’t expect that level of growth to continue this year but we do expect some growth. Our forecast is – remember, ours include the medium and heavy-duty trucks, so our forecast is 17 million to 17.5 million cars for the full year. In the industry for the full year, if you look at we were 16.8, it looks like Mark is going to come in around 17, 17.1 again with the medium and heavy number. And there we are racking up the numbers today as they are reported which is a strong industry. Remember, last year, we had a 17.1 industry because of how about February, January last year, so the comps year-over-year will top. But the industry is still strong and transaction part is still strong as well. So we are pretty much in line. Hope that kind of growth we are expecting in the industry and a lot of that’s being driven by retail demand. You can see the retail star down below. Strong retail growth, replacement demand and also new demand as the economy continue to improve. Of course, very important part of our business and very important part of how we look at the business is, pick-up truck sales and of course with our great new F-150 out, and this is a look back at where we’ve been in the last several years on both housing starts and pick-up sales. We know there is a strong correlation between the two and there is still room to run on housing as people know and so that voice – that could up the pick-up truck business for the next several years to come with the housing market continues to grow which we expect it to do. Now there have been some offsetting factors with the oil market in the US dropping up, all segmentation dropping up a little bit with the rig counts and et cetera, but the real gas prices have more than compensated for that. So it’s still a healthy environment for trucks seeing that in transaction prices and in the overall volumes. So our US market share that’s how we expect to grow this year. We lost about a point of share last year. A lot of that was – like six tenth of that was F-150 related and because of the limitations we had – the balance that we are giving out between pricing and volume, but we had a fixed number of vehicles to sell and that transitioned from our old model to our new model, it has gone very well, it’s been timed very well and our manufacturing launch has gone extremely well. So we were on this one year journey almost between summer to summer that we have to manage to maximize the margins and the revenue loss selling down and converting over to the new one. In the first quarter, this is through February, of course, if you looked at our numbers in March we are still racking up the numbers, but our sales were down 3% total in March, but that was due to fleet sales because we are not delivering really F-150 to fleet customers yet as we fill up the pipeline and we see strong retail demand for the F-150. Our three customers are waiting. They know they are coming in the second quarter. We timed it that way. So there is no lack of demand, but it’s certainly a lot of interest in the trucks at the retail level. At the same time, the Edge launches in the first quarter and we didn’t have a lot of Edge deliveries to fleet or in some cases to retail as well. So, that’s why we are looking forward to the second half of the year and most of our launches are based on the first half of the year including Edge and Explorer and F-150. If you look at – I mentioned that one of the key priorities we are going to make is on our quality improvements, we had a significant improvement last year in June in the JD Power Initial Quality Survey and we went above industry average from the bottom quartile the year before, but dramatic improvements in the brand, this represent the 14 mile year versus 13 mile year and we can see that, that gap to best-in-class dropped by about almost 60%. So we saw significant improvement year-over-year. I don’t have the data with me because we are not ready to share it yet, but I can tell you that 15 mile year progress continues and we are seeing significant progress in our 15 mile year quality results so far as well. That’s significant for two reasons, one, you can see the gap to best-in-class to 14 mile on TBWs things have gone wrong, have decreased significantly and we are seeing significant improvement in our 15 mile year on that subject and because we had 16 major launches last year. Historically, we haven’t delivered significant quality progress, while we had major launches. So, the teams worked really hard to bring those two together and I am hopeful you’ll see a lot of good data coming forth in that. We are at all time best levels on quality in the North American system today both on warranty and on things gone wrong. So, encouraging signs and hopefully more to come. This is a product slide we show at the business review every Thursday morning and the green represents, just a reminder on what we launched new last year, and the blue is what is launching new this year and just going back for a second, you’ll recognize a lot of those name plates from F-150 to Mustang, the Focus and Explorer and Edge and Expedition and Transit. We have a medium duty truck coming later this year as well. A big part of our portfolio is changing over the last year, this year. In fact, more than half of our sales in this calendar year will be products that’s all new in the last 12 months. So, you can see the transition we are going through and the opportunity that presents, because best part wins in the marketplace, if it’s well executed of course which we are pretty proud of that as well. This is the F-150, if you’ve been living in Iraq, you didn’t now we have a new one. As you may have heard actually it’s also have aluminum body. I will say that we are really proud of this truck. It’s one of our 28 major awards now. It’s won just about – almost every major award in North America and the consumer acceptance of the truck so far has been outstanding and the truck, the 15 mile year turn in 18 days in March and the lot turned 18 days in February and the lot 12 days in January. It’s turning much faster than we expected at a much higher mix which is great. And we are also seeing selling demand so far 14 mile year. That’s why the F series sales need to be very strong. And if you look at the launch itself, again lot of questions on this, Dearborn truck is up to full volume. IT has been now for over a month. It’s full production three crews running at jobs and everything that we are looking for and the quality looks great. Kansas City Assembly Plant is still on its launch curve. It’s on three crews and we expect it to ramp to full production over the next couple of months in the second quarter. We’ve been shipping for quite sometime out of Kansas City and we are looking forward in the summer getting our inventory levels up to levels where we can start to really run after the market and excited about that. So, so far so good in the F-150 launch and the consumer acceptance for the truck has been great and the sales have been very strong so far as well. Now, a little bit on the marketing update, because you don’t see this I mention all the time. Just to give you a little feel for the impact F-150 has in our business and just how much interest it generates. We got $52 million video reviews from different sources on YouTube and otherwise on the F-150, just think about that for a second. Our demand metrics remains very strong. Over 1.2 million online build and price, we’d still take the time to build and price to truck, may not buy, but they are still interested in it. So, that is great and an additional 410,000 requests for information from our dealer network. So you can get a sense for as to what that looks like. We sold 15,000 F Series in March, just to give some perspective here of what these numbers look like. As I said, we are turning – I gave you the March number, it’s actually 18 days again. In March we have our new mile truck with about clearly less than 30% of our sales represent and it still continues to climb up as the inventory gets out there. And the mix has been very strong and the transaction prices for F-150 or in total – or F Series in total were up over $2000 in March over last year. So you can see that the rich mix is dealing and the demand in the new truck. We are also very excited about the new Edge which is being launched as we speak up in Oakville in Canada. It’s a great all new product. It’s a little bit longer, more leg room in the rear, great new engine, the 2.7 liter eco-boost engine for the sport version. This is part of our most technologically advanced sport product we’ve ever built. It has almost all the features we can think of. Very exciting product and we began shipping those in March. So starting to arrive in dealership and we had a good month in March on the Edge sales. They were driven by the old model of course, but we are very excited about this new product and getting it in the marketplace. We also have assessing on the Explorer. I don’t need to tell you how important Explorer is to our business. We sold over 7 million of them since we started the Explorer in the 90s and our Explorer sales in March was very strong. Demand for the Explorer for the last – this segment and the SUV segment seems to be very strong. We’ve been prioritizing increasing production capacity in Chicago for the Explorer in the last couple of years. We’ve been building more and our inventory levels are rising which is allowing us to sell more which is why we are seeing so much growth in the Explorer sales. A very strong business and we are very excited about this, especially the platinum version which is good for the Explorer, again, high end. We have seen continued high-end content on these SUVs need to grow and we are very excited about what Explorer is going to do for us as new 2.3 liter eco-boost engine – at the eco-boost offerings, plus the sport version. So, very excited about this product and very important to our business. We’ve been talking a lot about performance, especially in Detroit and ourselves. We kept the DTA figures and we certainly got lot of attention for that as well since January. But this is just a representation of some of those great Ford performance products and this is really important to the brand, when it talks a lot about innovation and a lot of our new technologies, lot of our new development can first show up on performance vehicles, whether it’s carbon fiber tub to the Ford GT, whether it’s carbon fiber wheels in the G-350R and Mustang and whether it’s what we are doing on aero and light weighting of aluminum structures and et cetera. And also it brings a different kind of customer to our brand. On the FZ product, Focus is the FZ, 50% of the buyers – 54% of the buyers are new to Ford. And we’ve done some research and on our Ford performance products, the customers who buy a Ford performance product, half of them buy a Ford and that’s vehicle for another vehicle. So you can see the passion that brings to the brand. We are very excited about these products. We have the new Rafter coming out next year. We have the Mustang Shelby GT350R which is a Mustang on there. Of course, the GT, there is only going to be 250 on the year. So a wait line, but that’s the focus. We are showing it for the New York Auto Show and not on this show, but we also introduced the Focus RF going to be coming to the US next year and in the stand here in New York so if you want to see that. So lot of great news here coming forward. Of course, this week, here in New York, we spent a lot of time talking about Lincoln. And Lincoln is a very important part of our future. As you know, the luxury part of the industry is growing, it’s growing fast as the average industry overall. The fast part of the business generally speaking around the world and we have a lot opportunity and a lot of heritage with Lincoln, but lot of opportunity. So, our focus on Lincoln is around really three main priorities. A distinct brand, what is Lincoln going to stand for and how can it be different to the consumer both in their experience and in the product. So we talk a lot about that this year. Unique and compelling product. We just unveiled the continental concept, it’s been very well received this week. The fourth of the four new products that committed a few years ago to Lincoln and then really working hard on superior try and experience to make sure that people get a chance to really experience Lincoln in a new way, in the Lincoln way they were talking about both in China and elsewhere. Lot of good opportunity for China as well as we’ve just launched Lincoln in China in the fourth quarter of last year. We’ve been on a journey and we think it’s going to be a journey with an investment in the future but also it’s going to take time to get Lincoln where we wanted to be. This is just a little bit of reminder of where we been in that journey already over the last couple of years. And when you look at it, we have a steady plan to not only reinvent Lincoln as a brand but also have the right product portfolio and the consumer experience for that. If you look at the same product class, I said you before on Lincoln, also a lot of new products coming for that brand as well, where the MKZ which is all new last year, which is incremental volume to the brand, it’s been helping grow the retail sales increases. The Navigator was test in last year and it’s been selling extremely well over the last several months, actually exceeding our expectations. It was up another 80% or something in March in last year and then MKX, all new coming later this year which we are very excited about. This is the MKX. As you’ll recognize it’s great proportion, very excited about this product and importantly a great new version of the MKX in a high volume segment for the luxury industry. There is the continental concept. If you go to the show – I’d encourage you please to go to Lincoln stand and see it. We are biased of course, but I think it’s a beautiful car that also embodies where the front-end feature is going to be for Lincoln. We’ve been working hard on the next generation where Lincoln goes as of design and you can see a lot of design elements here. Very excited about this vehicle both inside and out and it does takes Lincoln to a whole new level of the experience in the vehicle and the design DNA both in and out. So, very excited about this product and very important to the Lincoln brand both here in North America and in China. So just to summarize here in North America, a few key takeaways, the industry is strong. We are forecasting some growth this year, but importantly, as you look at the first quarter results, transaction price to build to be strong in the industry. So it’s a good sign of a healthy industry where you are seeing a little bit of growth and good transaction prices. Of course, in North America we are focusing delivering the 2015 launches following the 2014 launches and then getting our inventory in line to be able to grow in the second half of the year. I’ve talked about our quality actions. We are very pleased with the progress we are seeing there and we are making sure that we have our focus on that. So we have a strong business going forward. We do project strong margins to continue. We talked a little bit about North America and I’ll talk about that at the end of my presentation. First quarter does reflect the impact of our launches. Edge launch, so it was down a lot in the first quarter and the Kansas City Assembly Plant being down a lot transitioning to the new F-150. So, our margins and our progress this year will be impacted by the timing of our launches, especially in the first quarter and we are maintaining a lean cost structure and of course working hard on the Lincoln plan, you are seeing that in the product portfolio and the retail sales growth that we are seeing in Lincoln. So, good times to be in business in North America and we are really excited about what looks like for both Ford and Lincoln in 2015. So that’s North America. Now, let’s talk about the other end of the section a little bit, in South America. So this is a bit reverse of what we saw to North America. We had a strong line of 36 straight quarters of profitability in South America. For those of you forgot those already, very strong business for us. As you know, the world changed in the economic environment and political environment certainly in South America. Weakening currencies, high inflation, in many cases, high interest rates and trade policies or currency policies and balance of trade that are also impacting industry. And if you look at the South American industry in the first quarter, our estimate was down 18% year-over-year in the first quarter versus the first quarter of last year. Brazil was down 17% and Argentina was down 28%. So you are seeing significant industry reductions in the first quarter versus they were last year. Essentially, this is where we thought we are going to be coming into the year. So, a lot of pressure on the business. Currencies have weakened even further to people are projecting. If you look at the Reais in Brazil, it’s weakened even further than people were even projecting maybe three, six months ago. So, a lot things going on down there and we’ll talk a little bit about that. This is a snapshot of the business environment, you know it well. I already talked about it a lot. A lot of things providing headwinds to the business in South America. So our challenge and responsibility is to manage the business quite profitable as possible. We got to take advantage of the business that we have in front of us. I mentioned the industry numbers in the first quarter, but our market share in South America, we project is up 1.1 – percentage points on a basis of 8.5 to 9.6. That’s significant improvement in market share in South America in the first quarter driven largely by our performance in Brazil and Argentina and largely by the new cars, that’s been very well received and it’s been doing very well. I’ll talk a little bit about that in a second. Our strategy in South America, given the macroeconomic environment is, you see that is the One Ford Plan but also frankly to – we sit that down the hatches and get through the storm. We are seeing significant improvements in quality and our new products have dramatically improved the fuel economy of our products in South America. We’ve been implementing the double-product strategy. So now, pretty much across the line-up in South America, we have global Ford products which we are doing very well as indicated by the market share growth and it helps the brand as a long-term growth. We are working hard on the revenue and market share given the economic environment and the political and industry dynamics going on down there. And watching our footprint in our cost base as much as we can. And of course, importantly, managing currency risk and balance of trade between the countries, you know we’ve de-consolidated Venezuela and won’t be reporting that in our numbers any more. We are watching very carefully what goes in each of the integral countries so to make sure that we know where our balance of trade is and also where our currency and risk is and it makes volume to the currency. This is the same chart, the BPR chart that we showed for South America. You can see last year, the KA, the green on the upper right was the major launch, very important product for Brazil and the rest of South America. We also import some of the Mustang and some heavy-duty trucks but, I want to talk about – we launched the heavy-duty truck again Brazil, very important truck actually down there. And we imported Transit into the market down there. This year is a big launch Focus, especially on the Focus, which is made in Argentina. We are also exporting to South America the Explorer and the Edge from North America and in few markets the F-150. But the big launch this year is focused as KA was last year. This is the KA, you look at the all new KA has been a leading seller in Brazil since we launched it, most months been a top five selling car and it’s led to that market share gain I talked to you about. We are seeing significant market share growth in South America year-over-year in a very pressurized market given the dynamics, but very strong acceptance of the vehicle. I’m very excited about what it means to our future. This is the Ford Focus which is the kind of embodies the brand in South America. It’s a higher end car as you can appreciate in those markets and it really crafting kind of great looks and lot of technology. This is a very important car to us in South America to help establish the brand. EcoSport and Ranger also very important to us down there as well. A few key takeaways for South America. You know, the macroeconomic and political situations are challenging they are fluid and they change rapidly and so our team down there led by our President, Steve Armstrong and the team down there everyday dealing with a little bit of uncertainty in change but we are working very hard to make sure our capacity, our inventory and our volumes are lined up. So we don’t we get ourselves in trouble there. We continue to launch the One Ford product which is certainly a critical part of our plan. I already mentioned the Venezuela and long-term we still view South America as a very important part of the business, an attractive business region. As I told you nine figures of profitability, good returns to the company, I get through where we are today. The question is how long it lasts and – but the good question, and also at least making sure that we have a business model that could sustain us though during this time period. In Venezuela, now going on – frankly, I didn’t talk about it much because until we get dollars, we don’t buy parts. And so we don’t have parts, we don’t sell vehicles and so, it’s been a very depressed industry given the dynamics of the dollar availability in Venezuela. So let’s go back and talk about 2015. This was the guidance we gave for the business units and our key metrics for 2015. They are unchanged which is good news, it’s talked about on April 1. We still expect higher profit in North America and operating margins in the 8% to 9% range. We are off to a good start. South America, we felt it will be substantially improved for the base of – almost $1.2 billion loss last year. I will say that, as I mentioned that the industry has been down more in South America in the first quarter then we were to project it given the plan and currencies have weakened even further and we planned for launching in South America very carefully. Europe will be improved results, we project it to be a lot but you can see as the primary in our loss last year. Asia-Pacific, profits will be higher this year versus last year. Our interest expense will be equal to or higher than last year and of course profits which is the great part of our business will be equal to or higher than last year. So, reconfirming the guidance we have given for the total profitability to be in the $8.5 million to $9.5 million range excluding special items and the break-up by the business units as they are described here. If you look at – importantly, both for – when we did the fourth quarter earnings call, we showed the slide in the last in Ford University we showed the slide in the right one that reinforces to our colleagues and all our investors and all the folks associated with Ford, we do expect our profitability, a conversation of our profits in 2015 will not be consistent with our typical year. The green line kind of represents historical and the blue represents kind of directionally where we’ll be in 2015. As I told John, these are not the scale, so don’t try and do the math and don’t try and get your ruler out and figure out what’s underneath the curve. We’ve already said that this year will be more profitable than last year. So you can understand we don’t want to give out too many hints. It’s abnormal because of the timing of launches, not just in North America, with fully the F-150 and the Edge launch has impact first quarter, but also in Asia-Pacific, where we’ve been – where we are launching a bunch of new plans in the first half of the year including – which Mark was there to open the last two weeks and also the new plant. And a lot of new investments and a lot of new growth in products and in plants in the first half of the year. So that also affects what’s going on. Also a reminder that, for 2015, we expect our full year operating effective tax rate to be comparable with similar 2014, but we do expect that rates to vary by quarter. So you can see that in the slide here and in the first quarter to be higher than the run rate for the full year. So we wanted to reinforce that with everybody out there. So they can make sure their models are working correctly. Let’s talk about 2015 planning assumptions and key metrics. We do expect the US influence earlier to be about $70 million. First quarter is off to around that kind of start as we look at it, high 16s will be the math I think is going to come in for the first quarter. We do expect our revenue on the automotive side to be higher than 2014 with the growth we expect to see here and also around the world. Our operating margin to be higher than what it was last year, our operating cash flow to be higher and of course pre-tax profit as I said earlier is equal to or higher and the corporate profits already talked about. So a strong business and a strong environment for most parts of the world. And just reaffirming where we think things will turnout for 2015. We think 2015 is going to be a really strong year for us and really have the opportunity to be a breakthrough year for Ford coming off of 2014. With the 24 global launches we had last year, especially the 16 here in North America, sets us up very well, especially with our launch timing this year for a strong year, especially in the latter half of the year both in North America and in Asia-Pacific and so that’s the plan. Next slide, here, if you look at, just in summary, our plan hasn’t changed which is great, where we are all working on accelerating the development to deliver the plan. Our long-term objectives haven’t changed. We are very excited about the future. We had our challenges and there is some uncertainty and there is some newness in the street that makes so exciting and also provides an opportunity. An opportunity for those – companies like ourselves to innovate and learn and grow and to be a part of the solutions for not just the industry, but for our consumers and for our economies and for our governments and we are excited about that future and we think that our plan is focused well to be able to do that to adapt and also be part of the solution to the issues and ideas that are out there. And we look forward to of course delivering our framework to be able to deliver and execute the business. So, that’s a quick run through the One Ford story for the Americas. A tale of two different continents to be sure. Exciting times in North America and exciting times for Ford and Lincoln, at the same time in South America, we are working through the challenges and looking for the opportunities to prevail for not just the near-term goals but for the medium and long-term. And with that, John, if we may – we can go to questions. I’ll kick it off with the first question. The pricing environment in the US continues to drive the upside particularly at Ford which is a really, really good thing. I am just curious if you are looking your products and your strategy and your capacity utilization level, how long do you think that will last? How long you can hold on to that and also, because it has been so good, it seems like you guys are really pushing mix, a lot of these platinum series vehicles, a lot of the Explorer. So, that’s part reflects that mix, but it’s very profitable actions that you are taking and we are trying to – how you think about where pricing and mix can go, because it seems like it just continues to surprise the upside? Yes, thanks, John. It’s an important part of our business. We do focus very much on profitable growth and the margins that go with that. Where we’ve been constrained F series lately and some of the SUV products, we’ve been working very hard to give content with value-added to the consumers that also provides the opportunity for more up scaling on the series and the mix and the opportunity to grow the revenue. So it’s for the good example, - Edge is another good example that and certainly F series has shown that on the F-150 launch as well. Because when you are constrained, we are obviously worked to break those constraints to a certain extent because that’s important and we’ve been seeing that, we’ve been increasing capacity on Super Duty on Explorer, we are working hard on F-150 and of course we have to get to the launch, the scope of the increasing capacity. But the industry has been – in some respects out running the capacity and so we’ve been – a the same time looking at mix and looking at our pricing to make sure we are optimizing that full equation. And as you’ve seen throughout the last year, even where we’ve been constrained, we’ve been working very hard on making sure those transaction prices are healthy and it can get even healthier. As we look at holistically, we don’t just chase share, we don’t just chase margin, we are trying to balance that equation. But we definitely are looking at in that way and one of the ways to do that is to give the customers who want that even more content which then provides more revenue and we are seeing – especially in the SUV side that opportunity has been very strong. Ford and Platinum and we are very excited about that as well as what we are doing with the Explorer. If you haven’t seen the Platinum version of the Explorer, it’s outstanding and that’s new, we don’t have a Platinum version of Explorer today. I’ll jump in for a quick one and – the move to aluminum, my crew it’s been a recent phenomenon and it’s a very big move. From a manufacturing side, can you share with us anything that your team would learn, positive or negative on the production side on some aluminum end F-150, has there been any surprises on the cost side, the pricing been great but, we don’t know much about the cost side and then maybe the customer talks you held with your dealers, is there an excitement about aluminum and now that gasoline prices are a lot lower that changed any of the dynamics of demand of that vehicle? Sure, let me just start-up saying that, the launch – we have not awarded – the launch of the F-150 has gone extremely well and we are proud of that product both in the consumer standpoint but also from a manufacturing and quality and engineering standpoint. The – from a manufacturing standpoint, I would say, we learned a lot from Dearborn which we are able to incorporate in the Kansas City and the Kansas City launch has gone even better than the Dearborn launch, because of those learnings. We’ve been very pleased to see the – well, I say the manufacturability of the F-150, I think I was quoted in January saying the truck builds well, which is in the manufacturing term, which means it doesn’t – it isn’t difficult but on the on the line, that some vehicles are harder to build and others and the teams are now getting job of making sure that we can do that. There’s been a lot of learnings on the stamping side, to be standard, we don’t talk about that a lot. But stamping aluminum in high volume is very different than forming metal, sheet metal or the steel. And as many a learnings on the stamping side has been on the buying shop side of riveting and bonding and everything else which has been important learnings for us, because of the dynamics of aluminum respond differently as you can appreciate than steel. So that’s the difference in learnings there, which has been great. I would say on balance, both Dearborn and Kansas City launch faster than I expected they would which has been great and bodes well for the future of my learnings. We have over 100 patents on the vehicle, more manufacturing related, so we are excited about that. The consumer acceptance has been great, you remember that was even the poor gas prices started dropping, we were selling a lot of times talking about the capability of the truck that was enabled by taking the read out. And that’s an very important part of equation, it was always as fascination on what the fuel economies are going to be because it’s aluminum and the light weighting. But equally important to the truck customer was the capability that came with that light weighting and that’s been an important part of the class leading payload, the great acceleration, the stamping distance, the maneuverability of the truck and how it drives and that’s the feedback we’ve been getting. People are so pleasantly surprised at how easier it’s to drive and that’s – where that comes from the light weighting and what it feels like the drive it and that was the very important part of our strategy all along, of course, we didn’t expect fuel economy be where – fuel prices to be where they are today, to be honest, couple of years ago. But the reality is for truck buyers that capability was always paramount and they want better fuel economy which we are also giving them. So, the other thing that people are realizing is that, let me take all that weight out, you get the benefit of weight out, you get the benefit of fuel economy savings no matter what you do. And there is always this debate on is it highway, is it city, is it – and our truck because the weight came out always, you get the benefit, no matter what you are doing, long something if you are going up the hill, if you are – what you are doing, so that’s the feedback we’ve been receiving. There’s been very little apprehension around the aluminum from what we get from our dealers. So aluminum noise we are on about what insurance rates would be and what that they been pretty comparable as these people see, now we’ve been selling them for several months. And so that has kind of died down and people are very excited about the truck and again they are turning about as quickly as we can get them in there. So, so far so good. Thanks, so we have the same question to GM this morning, again I would ask you. Regarding contract renegotiations or new contract negotiations with your suppliers, the annual price downs that you are getting, let’s say in the last few months, is that the same that you are getting in the last several years? Is it better, or is it worse and are there any trends, maybe by region or by products that you can talk to? I would say, I can just speak to honestly to North America, South America is at a different environment right now, but, in North America, I would say there is nothing demonstrably different from where we’ve been as far as cost downs and our TVM activity, our total volume – our working with supply bases to come up with ideas to reduce COGS. And what we are seeing there is consistence, I would say, it’s I would use the word I would use, of course commodity prices have come down. So, in conjunction with that, we are seeing lower commodity prices and, so if we have commodity price negotiations that are obviously different than your cost down, you are regular kind of a cost improvement initiative which are pretty consistent. So, we do have a lot of new products. So, when you go through a launch, you are going to leave yourself with a period where you don’t make it much change at all, because you want to stabilize the product and then you – once you get through the launch, you work with the supply base and your own engineering group to work with the cross-selling opportunities. So we are about to embark on a pretty busy stage in that regard, because we had so many new launches, but that’s not different because it’s more abundant and difficult. So, I have to say, there is not much difference as far with the supply base other than commodities being lower on most commodities and that’s a different dynamic. Yes, yes, right, either that of the F-150, both. There is a lot going on, I mean when we look at where you are positioned versus a company like Chrysler, I mean, obviously you have a lot fewer entry-level workers. So, there is going to be a debate of whether you get to raise your entry-level penetration or they get to lower their entry-level penetration or just goes away. I am curious what your thoughts are there. The union repeatedly to us highlights the fact that they've made a lot of concession since 2003 and at this point, they need to win for their membership. So I am just curious what you think that might look like from what we hear, it's about $1 to $3 raise, so something in that ballpark is what we have heard so I'm curious what you've heard there. And then, thirdly, whether you disagree with or agree with our idea that pensions could potentially ultimately be on the table and this round negotiations, or ultimately in the future so to tie those off and remove that risk, given really the risk of increased longevity or life expectancy that it may go up dramatically as signs really ramps up, particularly with stuff like immunotherapy. So, of course, you have negotiations this year are an important part of the plan for this year. Just a couple comments, first of all, now this start backwards, on the pension side of things, as you know, we’ve been working on salary over the couple of years of de-risking our portfolio and we were starting to see very strong benefits from that and we are starting to see probably good results from that. So we’ve been working on de-risking our portfolio on our own and want to continue to do that. Well, that’s the negotiations play out where they may, but certainly, we are very comfortable with how our pension strategy is working for us and we are seeing benefits from that. In regards to the negotiations themselves, there has been a lot of rhetoric and a lot of speculation on where the issues would be and where the priorities would be. I just make a couple comments. First of all, if you look into Dennis William’s comments and you are listened to the company comments, certainly understanding that for the investment levels to continue and the great job growth numbers that we’ve had in the US to continue, we have to maintain a level of competitiveness that makes sense. And so we will all work towards that and whatever that looks like. That’s number one, because the outstanding for those sales are - from history that don’t repeat it. There is a lot of cycles in this industry that we are all well aware of and we’ve all been through. So it’s in all of our interest to avoid those cycles at least with the dramatic ups and downs of those cycles in the future. And clearly the entry-level compensation of the entry-level employees and the percentage of the entry-level employees is something that’s getting a lot of attention and I’m sure that we can get a lot of conversation in the negotiations. It’s too early, we don’t talk many numbers or any directional things at this stage at the point where we are about getting more heavy in the summer. But clearly, we got to be open to – listening to each other to find out the solutions can be, but we all have the same interest which is ultimately to have a competitive business that can go over and compete so that we can continue to invest in the US and support the business here. Everyone have the same interest at heart. Interestingly just to call out, Dennis was very clearly called out the desire for patent bargaining in 2015 and so, how that looks and what it means for the fall will be something we all look together on, but ideally, some of those discrepancies that exist because of the bankruptcy at two of our competitors will set themselves out as part of our patent bargaining process. At the end of the day, I keep reminding people that what we did together while the master restructuring it works. And everybody is benefiting from that. The 14,000 jobs we’ve created in the US in 2011, the over $40,000 per employee of profit sharing in lump sum, our employees have – our UAW employees have gotten in 2011. So, if it don’t get balanced, that we all have to work with, but we have to remember how we got here and why we got here and then what we do about it going forward. And I am looking forward to the discussions and listening to where the opportunities are to keep our business competitive and also to be where would be the investments going forward. At the same time, we understand that we are ready with the big part of the restructuring took place in North America, so I know that personally. I was involved in all those negotiations and we’ll make sure that we have a business going forward that meets our expectations that we talked about but also meet the expectations of our employees as well. I have a quick balance sheet question. So as credit investors, we try to look at like what optimal liquidity on when your competitors brought out a $20 billion cover that was right for their company. How does your team think about what optimal liquidity on the balance sheet is, and how do you kind of weigh investor sense of it, share buybacks, rather to again investment grade profile, because it certainly circular in nature. Just kind of curious about where you are in the cycle? Sure, well, first of all we said very clearly that we want to remain investment grade status through any economic cycles, so that is an important part of our planning and part of our scenario. We do a lot with – leadership, our CFO, we do a lot of scenario planning, looking at different scenarios and making sure that we can have the right kind of liquidity. If you remember, one of the things that separated us from GM and Chrysler in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 was our liquidity. And making sure that we have ample liquidity to get through cycles is a very important part of our business planning. And in this industry, as you know, when the industry turns or the economy turns, especially in North America, you can burn through a lot of cash. So, we do a lot of scenario planning to protect for any kind of scenarios to make sure that we are we are comparable with our cash. As you know, we’ve given targets where we start debt levels to be and where they are going to be going forward and at par level than have been historically given the health of our balance sheet. And we talked about the funding of our pension plans, which is also very important and the de-risking nature of that. So we look at all these things in context together and of course, we have been increasingly rewarding our shareholders with dividends which has been an important part of our strategy and we’ve been raising the dividend over the last several years. And we’ve always said that we’ll continue to look at what that means. So, we’ve kind of tried to balance all these things very well, but it’s also very important to leadership team that we have the liquidity available to protect our – the viability of our business which is the product plan. Because we learned and saw the benefits of being able to continuing to keep our product plan heavily supported with liquidity and cash in the downturn and came out with healthier business because of it with a fresh showroom and gain share and we had a very profitable business. So, that’s kind of how we think about it. We do a lot of risk planning and risk scenarios. But we have been rewarding shareholders and we’ve talked about the willingness and openness of doing that in the future. As you remember Bob showed a chart or a slide in the Investor Day about talking about, if the future goes out the way we expect it to, that we will have opportunities to look at other opportunities to use our capital. But investing in the business for growth globally and making sure that we have the product pipeline full and fresh is a priority and certainly the de-risking and funding of the pension plan has been our priority as has been the debt reductions which you’ve seen and then importantly that growing contributions to our shareholder have also been priority. So we’ve looked at it in a very balanced way of making sure that we have liquidity for the future in any scenario.
