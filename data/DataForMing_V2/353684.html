Instagram Moves Fast And Breaks Things - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha This Seeking Alpha Eye on Tech column looks at Instagram’s plans to switch to an algorithmic feed from a chronological feed, and to increase its max video length. Both moves might have financial implications: Brands could spend more on ads to be seen on an algorithmic feed, and longer video ads could yield higher prices. Instagram’s willingness to make big changes in spite of seeing strong user and revenue growth fits with parent Facebook’s philosophy, and arguably contrasts with Twitter’s. Mark Zuckerberg once declared Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) has a "Move Fast and Break Things" development philosophy. The idea being that Facebook has to be willing to move quickly to build and change its products - even if the new offerings are imperfect at first - rather than miss opportunities by moving too slowly. Zuck changed this motto in 2014 to "Move fast with stable infrastructure" to account for Facebook's growth and the ripple effects bugs can have on its platform, but his company's willingness to make big changes to its core products, regardless of how successful they've been, remains intact. Facebook's recent willingness to replace its traditional Like button in favor of a Reactions feature containing six options (with Like being one of them) is an example, as was its 2014 decision to remove messaging from its core apps. And the same holds for two major changes recently unveiled by Instagram. The first change is Instagram's switch (currently in test mode) from a chronological feed view to a feed in which an algorithm decides the order in which followed posts appear (much as it does for core Facebook's news feed). Instagram: "The order of photos and videos in your feed will be based on the likelihood you'll be interested in the content, your relationship with the person posting and the timeliness of the post … We're going to take time to get this right and listen to your feedback along the way." As one would expect, the move has sparked a backlash among some Instagram users worried about a big change to a service they love. It has also led the owners of many popular accounts who are afraid their material won't be seen as often to frantically urge their followers to enable push notifications for their posts. But provided the algorithm is implemented well (and Facebook deserves the benefit of the doubt here), Instagram's reasoning for ditching the chronological view is solid. Unlike Twitter, whose users often rely on it to get a real-time "pulse" of what's going on in the world, timeliness is just one of several factors that typically determines what posts a user wants to see first. And with the number of accounts followed by many of Instagram's 400M+ active users having ballooned in Facebook-like fashion, there's a clear need to prioritize the accounts a particular user really cares about. At the same time, there could be a major financial benefit to an algorithmic feed: Many brands will likely have to buy ads to guarantee a user following their account sees their posts, should Instagram's algorithm push down the location of a brand's content. This is exactly what happened as Facebook changed its algorithm to lower the rate at which posts from followed businesses appeared on news feeds. The company insisted the move was strictly done to optimize the user experience. Instagram's second change - less dramatic, but also noteworthy - is its decision to increase the max length of a posted video to 60 seconds. Advertisers (previously at 30 seconds) received the feature two months ago, and Instagram began rolling it out to everyone else (previously at 15 seconds) yesterday. Instagram notes the amount of time spent watching video on its platform has risen by over 40% over the last six months, and proclaims "longer videos mean more diverse stories from the accounts you love." Longer videos could also mean more lucrative video ad sales, as Instagram (like Facebook proper, YouTube, and many others) tries to get a bigger chunk of the video ad dollars moving from TV to digital channels. No one can say Instagram's changes are being made out of desperation: The service added 100M active users between Dec. 2014 and Sep. 2015, and soaring Instagram ad sales - they follow the launch of many new ad options - are believed to be a big reason Facebook's total ad sales rose 57% Y/Y in Q4 (improved from Q3's 45%). Rather, the changes appear linked to a Facebook development philosophy that includes an openness to reshaping core products, even after they've seen tremendous growth. The contrast with Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ), which continues taking a more cautious approach to overhauling core features even as its active user growth stalls, is hard to ignore.
