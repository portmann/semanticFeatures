ETF Hub Jul 16 2015, 12:40 ET | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor Applied Materials ( AMAT -3.6%), ASML ( ASML -4.9%), Lam Research ( LRCX -4.2%), KLA-Tencor ( KLAC -4.4%), Ultratech ( UTEK -4.8%), Rudolph ( RTEC -3.1%), Mattson ( MTSN -2.4%), Advantest ( ATE -2.6%), Teradyne ( TER -0.9%), and Kulicke & Soffa ( KLIC -1.2%) are lower (in spite of a 1.1% Nasdaq gain) after Intel cut its capex budget for the third time this year, this time by $1B to $7.7B (+/- $500M). The chip giant spent $10.1B on capex in 2014, and $10.7B-$11B in 2011-2013. Also: Intel disclosed it now expects to bring its first 10nm CPUs to market in 2H17, breaking with its historical 2-year manufacturing process upgrade pace and leading some to wonder if Moore's Law is proving harder to maintain. Intel's first 14nm CPUs (based on the Broadwell architecture) arrived last September. Separately, TSMC (cut its capex budget in April) provided cautious remarks about global chip demand. The world's biggest foundry expects 3% 2015 chip industry growth and 6%-10% foundry market growth. The selloff comes shortly after Applied and Lam provided aggressive 3-year EPS growth targets ( I , II ) at investor meetings held during the chip industry's Semicon West conference. ASML rallied yesterday following a Q2 beat and positive 2H15 outlook .
