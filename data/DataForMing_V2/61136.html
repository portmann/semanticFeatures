Carl Icahn Would Like Tim Cook To Buyback Some More Of His AAPL Shares | Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! It takes a lot to kick a dying ailing man in the guts as he is already agonizing on the floor, but nobody wants to do it to poor old Uncle Sam, do they? The World Platinum Council do not believe that platinum stocks will be completely depleted and reach zero because the amount includes long term holdings by private investors, sovereign wealth funds...

Here is the only part that matters in the latest massive, 2000+ word letter Carl Icahn just "sent" to AAPL CEO Tim Cook, in which he advocates an AAPL stock price of $240/share or over $1.3 trillion, or 8% of US GDP: We are pleased that Apple has directionally followed our advice and repurchased $80 billion of its shares (yielding the companyâ€™s shareholders an excellent return), but the companyâ€™s enormous net cash position continues to grow while the companyâ€™s shares are still dramatically undervalued. With Appleâ€™s shares trading for just $128.77 per share versus our valuation of $240 per share, now is the time for a much larger buyback.  We appreciate that the Board just increased the share repurchase authorization by $50 billion, and that it continues to prioritize share repurchases over dividends (as it should). We again simply ask you to help us convince the board of how these two underlying issues (inefficient net cash growth and share undervaluation) persist and combine to enhance the opportunity for accelerated share repurchases in greater magnitude. We also ask you to help us convince the board that this is not a choice between investing in growth and share repurchases.  As our model forecasts, despite more than 30% growth in R&D annually through FY 2017 to $13.5 billion (up from $1.8 billion in FY 2010) and your updated capital return program, Appleâ€™s net cash position (currently the largest of any company in history) will continue to build on the balance sheet. Share Repurchases â€“ we assume share repurchases of $37.5 billion, $31.25 billion, and $37.5 billion over the next three year for our forecast and not the more aggressive pace we hope the Board will undertake Uncle Carl and his two analysts remain convinced they know how to run AAPL better than its CEO and his thousands of employees. Uncle Carl and his two analysts have built up a massive stake in AAPL shares which however they can't get out of in this illiquid market without tipping the market they are selling - a tip which would promptly send the stock plunging - and as a result have come to the only buyer who is big enough to buy all of Icahn's shares without causing a massive ripple: the company itself. And here is just the cash AAPL holds domestically , and which can be used for buybacks and dividends without being forced to repatriate and pay taxes on its offshore cash: For now, however, Icahn's opinion is all that matters, and the value of AAPL stocks has risen by $8 billion just on one tweet. We again applaud you and the rest of management for Appleâ€™s  impressive operational performance and growth. It is truly impressive  that, despite severe foreign exchange headwinds and massive growth in  investment (in both R&D and SG&A), the company will still grow  earnings by 40% this year, according to our forecast.  After reflecting  upon Appleâ€™s tremendous success, we now believe Apple shares are worth  $240 today.  Apple is poised to enter and in our view dominate two new  categories (the television next year and the automobile by 2020) with a  combined addressable market of $2.2 trillion, a view investors donâ€™t  appear to factor into their valuation at all.  We believe this may lead  to a de facto short squeeze, as underweight actively managed mutual  funds and hedge funds correct their misguided positions.  To arrive at  the value of $240 per share, we forecast FY2016 EPS of $12.00 (excluding  net interest income), apply a P/E multiple of 18x, and then add $24.44  of net cash per share. Considering our forecast for 30% EPS growth in FY  2017 and our belief Apple will soon enter two new markets (Television  and the Automobile) with a combined addressable market size of $2.2  trillion, we think a multiple of 18x is a very conservative premium to  that of the overall market. Considering the massive scope of its growth  opportunities and track record of dominating new categories, we actually  think 18x will ultimately prove to be too conservative, especially  since we view the market in general as having much lower growth  prospects. We are pleased that Apple has directionally followed our advice and  repurchased $80 billion of its shares (yielding the companyâ€™s  shareholders an excellent return), but the companyâ€™s enormous net cash  position continues to grow while the companyâ€™s shares are still  dramatically undervalued. With Appleâ€™s shares trading for just $128.77  per share versus our valuation of $240 per share, now is the time for a  much larger buyback.  We appreciate that the Board just increased the  share repurchase authorization by $50 billion, and that it continues to  prioritize share repurchases over dividends (as it should). We again  simply ask you to help us convince the board of how these two underlying  issues (inefficient net cash growth and share undervaluation) persist  and combine to enhance the opportunity for accelerated share repurchases  in greater magnitude. We also ask you to help us convince the board  that this is not a choice between investing in growth and share  repurchases.  As our model forecasts, despite more than 30% growth in  R&D annually through FY 2017 to $13.5 billion (up from $1.8 billion  in FY 2010) and your updated capital return program, Appleâ€™s net cash  position (currently the largest of any company in history) will continue  to build on the balance sheet. It is our belief that large institutional investors, Wall Street  analysts and the news media alike continue to misunderstand Apple and  generally fail to value Appleâ€™s net cash separately from its business,  fail to adjust earnings to reflect Appleâ€™s real cash tax rate, fail to  recognize the growth prospects of Apple entering new categories, and  fail to recognize that Apple will maintain pricing and margins, despite  significant evidence to the contrary. Collectively, these failures have  caused Appleâ€™s earnings multiple to stay irrationally discounted, in our  view. When we compare Appleâ€™s P/E ratio to that of the S&P 500 index,  we find that the market continues to value Apple at a significantly  discounted multiple of only 10.9x, compared to 17.4x for the S&P  500, awarding the S&P500 with a 60% premium valuation to Apple: Importantly, as we have noted previously, we assume a 20% tax rate  for the purpose of forecasting Appleâ€™s real cash earnings, not the 26.2%  â€œeffectiveâ€? tax rate used by Apple, and view this as a necessary  adjustment, often overlooked by both analysts and investors. For more  detail on our methodology for this adjustment, please review our letter  titled â€œCarl Icahn Issues Letter to Twitter Followers Regarding Appleâ€?  published February 11th, 2015, which you can find here: http://www.shareholderssquaretable.com/letter-to-twitter-followers-regarding-apple/ By applying this adjustment to the current consensus FY2015 EPS of  $8.96 (among the 45 analysts who have updated their EPS targets since  April 22nd), the adjusted result is $9.71. Notably, while  previously criticized by some of these analysts as being too aggressive,  this consensus EPS forecast, which includes interest income, is now  largely in line with our own forecast of $9.60, which does not include  interest income. And, once again, we exclude interest income from our  EPS forecast because we value Appleâ€™s enormous net cash balance  separately from the enterprise, unlike most analysts. While our forecast for FY 2016 EPS is significantly above Wall Street  consensus today, in October 2014 so was our original forecast for FY  2015 EPS, which is now in line with the Wall Street consensus. We are  optimistic that ecosystem improvements (Apple Watch, Apple Pay, Homekit  and Healthkit in particular) will drive modest growth in iPhone revenues  next year, despite the difficult comparison that will result from  iPhoneâ€™s tremendous performance this year.  With a new iPhone expected  in September 2016, Apple stands to benefit as iPhone continues to take  premium market share (switchers from competitors), as the middle class  continues to grow in emerging markets, and as the modest level of  upgrades (only 20% to date) indicates pulling demand forward from FY  2016 to FY 2015 may not be as severe as some have highlighted.  Along  with a more dramatic push into the TV market, increasing traction with  Apple Watch, and the introduction of a larger screen iPad, we have  confidence in our forecast for FY 2016. We believe Apple Watch, Apple Pay, Homekit, Healthkit, Beats Music,  and further innovation in existing product lines collectively represent a  tremendous opportunity that on their own justify a valuation that, at  the very least, reflects a market multiple. That being said, we share  your excitement that â€œour best days are ahead of usâ€? and that Apple has  â€œno shortage of growth opportunities to pursue.â€?  The companyâ€™s dramatic  increase in R&D spending should signal to investors that Apple  plans to aggressively pursue these growth opportunities.   It may be  difficult for some to fathom (only because Apple is already the largest  company in the world), but Apple is very much a long term growth story  from our perspective, which is exactly why we believe the companyâ€™s  shares should trade at a premium multiple to the S&P 500, as opposed  to the S&P 500 trading at a 60% premium to Apple.  While we respect  and admire Appleâ€™s predilection for secrecy, the companyâ€™s aggressive  increases in R&D spending (and some of the more well-supported  rumors) have bolstered our confidence that Apple will enter two new  product categories: television and cars. Combined, these two new markets  represent $2.2 trillion, three times the size of Appleâ€™s existing  markets (if we exclude Apple Watch). Excluding advertising, the addressable market for television is  approximately $575 billion, which is larger than the smartphone market.  Also, given that people spend an average of 12% of the day watching TV  (equating to 25% of their free time), we view televisionâ€™s role in the  living room as a strategically compelling bolt-on to the Apple  ecosystem.  In addition to an Ultra High Definition television set, we  expect Apple to launch a related suite of tiered products and services,  including a â€œskinny bundleâ€? of pay-tv channels (partnered with various  media companies) and an updated Apple TV microconsole (which will  continue to service the massive install base of televisions offered by  other OEMs).  This will enable Apple to pursue the entire market by  offering multiple products at various price points across the  demographic spectrum.  Netflix offers a similar tiered approach to  pricing today by charging a higher price for those seeking the ability  to receive ultra high definition content. We believe this move into TV will also benefit all the other devices  and services in the Apple ecosystem. As just one of many possible  examples of this, the Apple Watch could perhaps be used as a remote  control. Similarly, as we expect Apple to launch a larger 12.9â€? iPad, it  would offer an enhanced viewing experience for an Apple pay tv service,  or act an improved â€œsecond screenâ€? to an Apple UltraHD television. At $1.6 trillion, the enormous addressable market for new cars is  approximately four times the size of the smartphone market. Itâ€™s  estimated that people spend an average of 1 hour every day traveling,  mostly in cars, but not everyone drives, implying that the average time  that daily commuters spend in a car is much higher. We believe the  rumors that Apple will introduce an Apple-branded car by 2020, and we  believe it is no coincidence that many believe visibility on autonomous  driving will gain material traction by then. As autonomous driving would release driversâ€™ attention from the  activity of driving and navigating, and perhaps even increase the time  people actually want to spend inside a car, both an automobile and the  services provided therein become even more strategically compelling.  While Apple currently addresses this market with CarPlay, it seems  logical that Apple would view the car itself as a the ultimate mobile  device to which it could bring its peerless track record of marrying  superior industrial design with software and services, along with its  globally admired brand, and offer consumers an overall automobile  experience that not only changes the world but also adds a robust  vertical to the Apple ecosystem.  And for Apple, the car market is more  than big enough to â€œmove the needleâ€? significantly, even as the worldâ€™s  largest company. The rising cost of oil, its impact on global warming, the  geopolitical risks associated with oil dependency (especially as fuel  for automobiles), followed more recently by the rise of cost effective  alternatives presents a â€œchange the worldâ€? opportunity for Apple.  It is  widely believed that the electric battery will play a key role in this  transition. The lithium-ion battery already represents a critical  component across many of Appleâ€™s existing products (iPhone, iPad, Apple  Watch, MacBook, Beats) and any further innovation could be a â€œgame  changerâ€? in terms of both battery life and form factor across Appleâ€™s  entire ecosystem.  Since lithium-ion batteries represent a large  percentage of the cost of todayâ€™s electric vehicle, we believe Apple  should be well positioned to leverage its existing knowledge domain and  more robust R&D spending in this area, and in turn apply any energy  density / battery life improvements for a car across all the other  products in its ecosystem that will share the benefit from such battery  innovation (iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, MacBook, Beats). As a mobile device that is differentiated by design, brand, and  consumer experience where software and services are increasingly  critical, an Apple car would seem to be uniquely positioned. While the television and the car offer tremendous growth  opportunities, Appleâ€™s core ecosystem continues to improve and grow, now  sometimes referred to as a â€œmega-ecosystemâ€?, a term we find  increasingly appropriate, as we look at the breadth of its components,  which now include existing products (iPhone, Apple Watch, Mac, iPad,  Beats, Apple TV), software/services (Apple Pay, Homekit, Healthkit,  Carplay, iCloud, iTunes, and rumored Beats Music, pay TV service), as  well as possible new products in new categories (a Car, a TV set).  Furthermore, ongoing innovations and enhancements to all of the above  will drive even more premium market share gains for iPhone, which sits  at the epicenter of this mega-ecosystem. Apple has clearly demonstrated a track record of excellence and  success when entering new categories.  We expect this to continue with  the Apple Watch, the television, and the car, and the world will look  back on todayâ€™s undervaluation as a fascinating example of market  inefficiency (and likewise on our valuation at 18x earnings per share as  conservative).  Because of this, we encourage both accelerated and  larger-magnitude share repurchases as you consider how to allocate  capital going forward. As you continue to evaluate this opportunity, and  consider the right prices at which to opportunistically repurchase  shares, we hope you give credence to our advice in light of our  investment record. Unlike the many actively managed mutual funds and  hedge funds that are underweight Apple and have underperformed the  S&P 500, we have exhibited strong outperformance, thanks in part to  our large position in Apple.  The Sargon Portfolio (a designated  portfolio of assets co-managed by Brett Icahn and David Schechter within  the private investment funds comprising Icahn Enterprisesâ€™ Investment  segment and High River Limited Partnership, subject to the supervision  and control of Carl Icahn) has generated annualized gross returns of  36.9% since its formation on April 1, 2010 through April 30, 2015 with  $8 billion of assets under management as of April 30, 2015. If you choose not to pursue some of the new categories we  highlighted, or you find our growth forecasts too aggressive for any one  new category in particular, weâ€™ll be the first to admit that you are  more knowledgeable in these areas than we are. But we believe, that  under any circumstances, you would agree that in the aggregate, all  these new categories taken together (along with those of which we may be  unaware) represent one of the greatest growth stories in corporate  history, as well as one of the greatest opportunities ever for a company  to invest in itself by repurchasing its shares.

You can't do it because it is pure BS. Icahn is from the old days for you youngsters. He does whatever he can to pump up the price so he can dump. Back in the 80s, they were greenmailers. They would threaten a takeover and crap. Now their tactics have changed but the objective hasn't. These PE and various (hedge) funds aren't new. They have been around for decades. They just change their title and tactics from time to time.
