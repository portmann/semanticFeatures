Apple The Biggest Threat To Visa And MasterCard - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple attacks Visa and MasterCard through all three vectors: in-store payments, online payments and P2P transactions. The AmEx partnership in Canada and Australia is targeted to put pressure on local banks and credit cards companies. In the last few months, the competition over the electronic and mobile payments market has intensified as new players like Samsung Pay ( OTC:SSNLF ) and Google's Android Pay (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) joined Apple Pay (NASDAQ: AAPL ), PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL ), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and many more in the race to become the favorite payment processor. The increased competition makes it very hard for most players to generate adequate revenues in this market. However, the two biggest winners from this situation are Visa (NYSE: V ) and MasterCard (NYSE: MA ), which process the payments behind the scenes. As I described in an earlier article , having a large number of players in this market allows Visa and MasterCard to keep the control over the transaction processing fees in their hands as there are no immediate leaders to require terms or discounts. Visa and MasterCard maintain their position in the e-payments market as long as no one challenges their dominance in the market and questions that model. Most companies active in the e-payments market don't want to poke the bear and risk their relationship with Visa or MasterCard so they take the situation as is and try to work within their boundaries. However, the real threat to the credit card duo is Apple - the tech giant has already proved that it could change consumer habits and market dynamics and according to its recent actions, Visa and MasterCard should be concerned. The e-payments market has three vectors: in-store payments, online or in-app payments, and peer-to-peer transactions. Ultimately Apple's goal is to transact payments directly between customers and merchants and between two users of Apple Pay in order to cut the middleman fee and increase net revenue from the Apple Pay business. The first step toward complete independence would be to convince banks around the world to partner with Apple and bypass the large credit card companies. Apple and the banks could generate more cash from such a model than the current credit card model. However, banks have a lot to lose in such a move. Banks would be glad to work directly with the e-payment service. However, they need to keep their relationship with the major credit card companies intact. Moreover, this move could transfer traditional activities, like cash or check transactions, from traditional banks to e-payment services. To succeed, Apple challenges the financial industry on three fronts. Apple Pay's penetration into Canada shed some light on Apple's struggle to challenge the current credit card model. After months of negotiations with local banks and the international credit card networks, the company decided to launch the service solely based on the American Express (NYSE: AXP ) customer base. However, when AmEx holds only 6% of the credit card market in Canada, Apple Pay is not likely to become a huge success up north. In its fiscal Q4 2015 conference call , CEO Tim Cook mentioned that Apple will partner with AmEx not only in Canada but also in Australia when the service becomes available later this year. This strategy is different from the one that the company took last year when it entered the U.K. and partnered with all three major credit card companies and with the major banks. The change in strategy seems like a tool to put pressure on credit card companies and banks while Apple Pay expands worldwide. As the global banks and the credit card companies become aware of Apple's impact on consumers' habits, it's hard to imagine that they will decide to ignore Apple Pay worldwide. I believe Apple's partnership with AmEx is a move to expedite negotiations with banks and credit card networks worldwide. Negotiating with banks on a peer-to-peer transaction service adds another piece to the puzzle. As I mentioned earlier, the e-payment business has three vectors, and Apple attacks each one of them. Apple Pay's P2P transaction could impact not only rival services but also Visa and MasterCard services - by gaining more share and power in one vector, Apple could use it to receive better terms from banks and credit card companies in other vectors. On another front, to gain additional market share in the competitive e-payments market in the short term with a proven outcome, the company could acquire one (or more) of the existing players, like Square (NYSE: SQ ) and Stripe. This move could put much more pressure on banks and credit card companies to settle with Apple on fees and terms, and Apple could slowly expand globally with its massive power, leaving local banks worldwide little power to negotiate on terms. I believe Apple's multi-front move will succeed, and in a few years we will see Apple controlling a significant piece of the e-payments market. As only the in-store e-payments market is expected to be worth more than $800B in 2019, Apple Pay could grow to become a significant portion of the company's revenue mix in a few years.
