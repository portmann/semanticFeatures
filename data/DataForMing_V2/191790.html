Investors Are 'Frozen' By Disney's Recent Selloff - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Gary Jakacky , Touring the World By Bicycle (79 clicks) Disney's nearly 25% drop this past summer was its worst selloff since 2011. Should we wait till the shares fall back to more traditional valuation ranges? I have run numerous articles about Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS ) over the years, but my most recent one in February has become relevant and useful for the second time in the last 12 months. The basic premise of that article? Since the five-year bull market had broadened and matured in recent quarters, there was a willingness on the part of investors to pay more for each dollar of earnings (or cash flow). Thus, valuations and price targets, based upon recent historical parameters, would be too conservative, and investors risked leaving potential capital gains on the table. At the time the article was written, Disney shares had just popped along with the broad market amid company news that a sequel to the smash Frozen was in the works. I presented a chart, which I reproduce below. "So what do we make of the recent surge, which has brought the multiple back up to this level? I contend that P/E expansion is under way and this price level will not represent a near-term top, let alone a point where the shares should be sold. Given the stronger American economy , relatively and absolutely, I think investors are getting enough confidence to pay higher multiples, especially for companies like Disney, which boast solid balance sheets and brand names." This was a very timely call, as Disney shares continued to rise this year (see the updated chart below), in the face of a very punk performance by the S&P 500. I change the time fame to five years to make the point more clear that multiple expansion did indeed occur. Prices pushed higher with strong volume support through the first six months of 2015. (A glance at Value Line shows that cash flow multiples also expanded). Let our analysis walk before it runs: the new threshold for maximum P/E appears be 26 or so. Previously investors got the vapors at 21. A glance at the upper chart shows the minimum threshold (with the exception of the darkest days of the financial crisis) to be in low-teens. If we assume - reasonably, I would contend - that this should be revised upward by a comparable amount, we should grab more Disney if, and when, the P/E drops to 17 or so. Value Line's $5.00 per share estimate for this year gives us a buy price of about $105 a share. Cranking numbers similarly for cash flow (we can discuss this in more detail in the SA reader comments below, I am sure) leads to a very similar price as the "bottom" for this recent selloff. I suggest long-term investors acquire shares at or near current levels. Given the high level of volatility in the markets recently, some SA readers might want to write puts to acquire the shares near or slightly below the current prices.
