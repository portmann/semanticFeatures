China Holds The Key To Apple's Success In 2016 - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in AAPL over the next 72 hours. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. I see fears over decreased iPhone unit sales in 2016 to be exaggerated. As long as Apple can keep executing well in China, it will continue to beat lowered Street expectations. 2016 has started, and so has the skepticism of many investors and analysts over Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) prospects for the year. According to Yahoo Finance, EPS consensus estimate for the fiscal year ended September 2016 has been revised down by 3% over the past 60 days, from $9.85 to $9.58, while the stock contracted 13% over the same period of time. Much of the bearish sentiment has been driven largely by concerns, introduced by Morgan Stanley last month , over inventory cuts and weaker global sales for the iPhone. I believe these fears, at least in the medium to long term, to be exaggerated. In my view, as long as Apple can keep executing well in its most promising market - China - it will continue to beat lowered Street expectations. Although usually a top-of-mind topic of discussion, I believe China's potential to make (or break) Apple's year is still under-appreciated. A quick scan over the company's FY15 10-K reveals that 27% of Apple's segment operating income came from Greater China. This is a significant geographic share increase from FY14 (18%) and FY13 (15%). With China's op income having grown at an aggressive rate of 108% in FY15 and 30% in FY14, I expect the role played by the region in Apple's success to increase over time. Each 10% growth in Greater China's op profits in 2016 valued at the total company's trailing EV/segment op income multiple (currently 7.0x) translates into the equivalent of a $2.78 increase in the company's stock price. A 30% growth rate in Greater China's FY16 op income, holding all else constant and assuming no valuation contraction or expansion, could translate into a stock appreciation of nearly 10%. It is worth pointing out that the conservative 7x multiple is the lowest it has been in the past three years, as illustrated on the table below. Source: DM Martins Research analysis, using Company report data The key question becomes: can Apple sustain robust double-digit op income growth rates in Greater China in 2016 and possibly over the next couple of years? I believe it can. Apple disclosed last quarter that it had opened its 25th store in Greater China, and that plans to reach 40 by mid-year 2016 are on track. To me, the accelerated pace of Apple's penetration in China is not surprising. In its 2013 report " Mapping China's Middle Class ," McKinsey & Company stated that 68% of Chinese households in 2012, what I calculate to be about 930 million individuals, earn the equivalent of the average Brazilian and Italian household income in purchasing-power-parity terms. In other words, two thirds of the Chinese population can already be considered part of the country's middle class. And the consulting firm projects that this number will reach 75% by 2022. Most importantly, McKinsey expects "that within the burgeoning middle class, the upper middle class is poised to become the principal engine of consumer spending over the next decade. [...] The evolution of the middle class means that sophisticated and seasoned shoppers - those able and willing to pay a premium for quality and to consider discretionary goods and not just basic necessities-will soon emerge as the dominant force." By 2022, McKinsey estimates that the upper middle class will account for 54 percent of urban households, compared to 14% in 2012. This is great news for a company whose flagship product, the iPhone, sells for a high average price of $670 and appeals mostly to higher-income earning demographic groups. Of course, McKinsey's predictions may prove to be wrong, especially on the heels of a Chinese economy that many fear could slow down. But being exposed to a middle-class market of nearly 1 billion individuals that is expected to grow rapidly in the next 5-10 years is not a bad position for Apple to be in. Another key driver worth highlighting is the growth of the high-end smartphone market in China. Even though overall smartphone shipment growth in the country is expected to be anemic in 2015, Apple is much more likely to benefit from a shift in consumer preference toward $500-plus devices. A report released by research firm GfK in August indicated that, despite a 5% year-over-year drop in forecasted smartphone units sold in China in 2015, the total value of those devices were expected to increase by 10%. I see this is a clear sign that not all device makers, and especially not Apple, will suffer from a cool down in smartphone sales in the country. My view is in line with GfK's forecast that the demand for high-end handsets should "expand 28 percent year-on-year in China, the strongest growth in this price band of any region in 2015." And this expansion rate could very well persist in the next few years, in my opinion. Keep in mind that any potential tailwind discussed above pertains to iPhone sales only. There is much more to be said about the revenue and profit growth potential of the many other products and services in Apple's portfolio. For example, the company introduced Apple Music, iTunes and iBooks in China last quarter, and the Apple Watch is still in its infancy stage - despite the 15 million Apple Watch units estimated by research firm Strategy Analytics to be sold worldwide in 2015. The impact of these initiatives in China is yet to be seen and properly measured. I believe that the hypothetical 30% growth in Greater China's FY16 segment op income that I proposed earlier, given the potential tailwinds discussed, might be a reasonable ballpark figure. In absolute dollar terms, it would represent only a $6.9B increase year-over-year, just over half the growth observed in FY15 in the region. Yet, this conservative estimate accounts for nearly one third of the total company's op income growth achieved in the most recent fiscal year. Whether Apple will be able to fully leverage China to turn 2016 into a successful year is yet to be seen. But the importance of the country in the overall strategy is undeniable. I believe the cards are stacked in Apple's favor and, given the recent pullback in share price, I would not dare to bet against the company in 2016. Tagged: Investing Ideas , Technology
