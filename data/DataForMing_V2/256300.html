Is You Tube Red A Real Threat To Netflix? - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha You Tube is seeking streaming rights to TV series and movies to bolster its new subscription service, You Tube Red. By adding TV shows and movies to this service, You Tube Red will now directly compete with the streaming giant Netflix. Whether You Tube Red will be able to capture Netfilxâ€™s market share will depend primarily on the quality of content offered by both players. On Wednesday, The Wall Street Journal reported that You Tube (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) is seeking streaming rights to TV series and movies to bolster its new subscription service. [ 1 ] On October 28, You Tube had launched its ad-free paid subscription service called You Tube Red for $9.99 a month. [ 2 ] By adding TV shows and movies to this service, You Tube Red will now directly compete with the streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ), which currently has more than 40 million subscribers in the U.S. and with aggressive international expansion plans hopes to be present in nearly 200 countries by the end of 2016. While You Tube Red’s differentiation currently is in terms of original content being offered without ads and offline play functionalities, its subscription rates are slightly higher than those of Netflix. With TV shows and movies in its offering and its popularity with current viewers, You Tube’s subscription model definitely has the potential to attract young users, thus impacting Netflix’s market share. U.S. streaming services constitutes nearly 70% of Netflix’s valuation, in our estimation. A key driver of this valuation is company’s U.S. streaming subscribers and we expect this figure to increase from around 45 million in 2015 to more than 60 million by 2022. For international markets, we expect this number to reach 70 million by 2022. However, with You Tube Red now entering this space, Netflix will have to face higher competition and this could impact the growth in its subscribers. You Tube’s popularity can be gauged with the fact that it has over a billion users and You Tube mobile reaches more 18-49 year olds than any other cable network in the U.S. [ 3 ] If even 10% of You Tube’s users subscribe to You Tube Red over the next five years, it could have 100 million subscribers and come very close to Netflix’s Trefis estimated number of subscribers. Given that You Tube will offer TV shows, movies, and that its content will be compatible with handheld devices with an offline play functionality, You Tube Red should have everything that Netflix currently offers, along with its own original content. You Tube has the “You Tube Space” production facility, which is focused on generating original content. As of March 2015, this facility produced over 100,000 videos, which have generated over 1 billion views. [ 3 ] Netflix has shown its commitment towards high quality original content by planning to triple the number of hours of original content (320 hours) in 2015 compared to 2014. This strategy has improved viewer perception of the company and it is no longer considered as solely a content aggregator. Although You Tube is a late entrant in the streaming services space, it appears to have an advantage in terms of its huge library of original content and its popularity with the younger audience. We believe in the future, a focus on good quality original content will be the key differentiator in this market. Whether You Tube Red will be able to capture Netfilx’s market share will depend primarily on the quality of content offered by both players.
