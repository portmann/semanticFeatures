Is Apple A Good Investment For Dividend Growth Investors? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple is far from a dividend aristocrat, having only started paying dividends in 2012. The dividend growth over the past five years has been solid, and the company has shown a dedication to returning capital to shareholders. I started my investing journey last year, and the second stock that I bought for my dividend growth porfolio was Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). In late July last year, the stock hit more than $130 a share, and I started my position after a drop to around $120 just a few days later. I've seen the stock come within a few dollars of my initial purchase price on a couple of times since my first small buy. I've also seen it drop to ~$90 a share on a couple of occasions. The ebb and flow of stock prices are not a big concern at this point, and I've had small purchases at a number of price points in the months since. As noted above, I bought Apple as a dividend growth stock. Usually, dividend growth investors lean toward dividend payers that have paid out a growing dividend for a decade or more. Most of my portfolio would fall into the latter category. Also, the dividend yield that Apple had at that time was just around 1.8 percent, which is lower than I would usually buy. However, I chose to invest a portion of my portfolio into companies that has a smaller dividend with the potential of higher growth over the long term. After all, it is possible to do quite well with AT & T (NYSE: T ) payments over the long term, but the growth of the dividend for the telecom giant has been right around ~2 percent for several years. This is not a quick grower, and companies with lower payout ratios and higher growth rates can eventually catch up. Apple has the potential to grow its dividend much more quickly than a stalward like AT & T. Its first dividend in nearly two decades was paid out in August 2012, so there is only a four-year history of recent Apple dividends. The first payout was just under $0.38 when accounting for the 7-for-1 split that the company provided for shareholders in June 2014. There have been four dividend raises in the past four years. Shareholders have benefited from raises of 15, 8, 11, and 10 percent over the past four years, which is much higher than the growth exhibited by some of the most popular dividend-paying stocks like the aforementioned T. A dividend that grows by around 10 percent a year should double approximately every seven years, and Apple's payout is already more than 50 percent higher than it was just four short years ago. This shows that it should come close to doubling after about seven years if their growth remains fairly constant. The most recent quarter was a bit of a disappointment to investors, as Apple's earnings dropped by more than $3 billion in the most recent quarter on a year-over-year basis. However, this was just three months after the company set a record with an $18.4 billion profit in December 2015. Even in a "down" quarter, Apple was still a massive cash cow with a net income of $10.5 billion. According to dividend.com, Apple currently boasts a dividend yield of 2.3 percent and a payout percentage of just 27.5 percent on a annual net income of $8.29 per share. This is a very sustainable dividend. Furthermore, Apple just announced that it had authorized buying out $35 billion worth of additional stock. This buyback program follows a retirement of nearly 5 percent of outstanding shares in FY 2015. This means that the dividend payout will be higher for each share after the 10 percent increase in the dividend, but that the overall payout will grow at a much slower rate because it will be paid out over fewer shares. If revenue and income remain relatively flat over time, the earnings per share be positively affected as a result of the buybacks. While Apple did not have a quarterly report that was as great as some recent reports, there is a new iPhone coming out later this year, and there are millions of people who are loyal customers who buy every new upgrade that the company puts out. This should provide a massive infusion of revenue toward the end of this year. In FY 2015, Apple reported a free cash flow of more than $70 billion while only paying out $11.56 billion in dividends. All of this points toward Apple being able to continue to grow the dividend in future years. The biggest concern is the possibility of lower-than-normal sales of the new release of the iPhone 7. In spite of this concern, I am planning to continue adding to my position with small periodic purchases in the future to dollar-cost average.
