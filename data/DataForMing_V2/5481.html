Disney's 'Cinderella' Belle Of The Box Office Ball With Over $100 Million Globally - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Disneyâ€™s live-action â€˜Cinderellaâ€™ reboot easily won the box office courtesy of a strong showing from women and children. What makes â€˜Cinderellaâ€™sâ€™ performance so interesting is that unlike past films like it the movie had a lesser known cast, a lower budget and was shot in 2D. Warner Brothersâ€™ â€˜Run All Nightâ€™ was expecting to do better business as counter-programming to â€˜Cinderellaâ€™ but came in under expectations. Female audiences again came out in force this past weekend as Disney's live-action Cinderella charmed its way to the top spot and taught investors some interesting lessons. After projections showing Disney's (NYSE: DIS ) Cinderella would likely earn between $55 million and $60 million many were slightly bullish the latest adaptation of the classic tale would exceed expectations…and it did. While final numbers won't be available until early next week right now the film is looking at around a magical $68 million to $70 million total. Simply put, women and children supported this film in every way and that helped boost its total. On the other hand (or foot if you want to use that analogy) Warner Brothers' (a subsidiary of Time Warner (NYSE: TWX )) Run All Night ran out of steam early on and saw its projections of $14 million to $16 million shrink down to around $11 million. That marks a new low for a Liam Neeson movie which just strengthens the case against the actor doing these hard "R" type of films. Warner hoped to use Run as counter-programming to Cinderella but it didn't work out as well as hoped. Yet the lessons from Cinderella are what is going to be of most interest to investors. As I mentioned last week , Disney currently has a ton of bankable franchises (Marvel, Star Wars, anything Pixar - and all incidentally on the roster for the rest of 2015) but its main economic booster prior to all of them were their iconic "Princesses." Girls loved everything about Snow White, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella with more Disney-created variations in Jasmine, Belle, Mulan and (un-officially) Frozen's Anna/Elsa furthering that market. Over the last few years Disney's been trying to re-invent those stories as well their iconic films like Alice In Wonderland in unique ways. What's so special about Cinderella though was that there was no grand make-over. A Tim Burton-like director didn't come in and do his "vision," we didn't see the story from the point of view of the fairy godmother or other main character and aside from a few areas that flushed out the narrative audiences got a fairly faithful recreation. Although that wasn't all as the film also didn't have a "name" cast or a traditional "name" director and it still dwarfed all comers. Yet you can't overlook the appeal of leads Lily James and Richard Madden, neither of whom were big names when production stated but over the years have become bigger names thanks to their roles on their massively popular respective series, Downton Abbey and Game of Thrones. (Incidentally, Sophie McShera who plays one of Cinderella's evil step-sisters in the film is actually James' co-star on Downton.) Of course the film's director is no unknown himself as Kenneth Branagh is a five-time Oscar nominee with a rich pedigree of roles and performances on his filmography . He's also the one who helped Disney launch the Thor franchise of films back in 2011 and the one Warner Brothers turned to re-launch the Jack Ryan franchise last year. While Thor remains a huge success, Ryan didn't resonate with audiences, but that had nothing to do with Branagh whose work on the project was praised. Still, the biggest thing to me that is likely going to be ignored (because it goes against Hollywood's upcharge mentality) is that Cinderella was made in good old fashioned 2D. One of the reasons why you saw higher totals for Alice In Wonderland, Oz: The Great and Powerful and Maleficent were because the trio were made in 3D, but also because of that they carried higher than needed budgets. Unlike the triple digit totals of the above, Cinderella was made for $95 million and will easily recoup that domestically next week. Worldwide the film has already earned well over $125 million total and that's including strong showings in China and Russia, two countries whose audiences heavily support 3D films.
