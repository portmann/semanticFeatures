2016 Won't Be Apple's Biggest Year - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple's current device cycle is showing patterns of weakness from a multitude of channel-checking sources. Furthermore, these device production figures are pretty bad when compared to 2015. Following a weak quarter, Apple's stock price exhibits unreasonable amounts of volatility. As such, it would at least be prudent to wait and see. Furthermore, after factoring in the upside from new products like the iPad Pro and Apple Watch, the drop-off in AAPL's iPhone revenue is neutralized. After I include the currency impact, increases to R&D-related expenses and share buybacks, my EPS forecast indicates a 4% y-o-y decline. The stock is currently trading at a fair value based on my statistical model, and quite frankly, investors have a better chance of maximizing gains by buying AAPL after the Q1 earnings. While I do anticipate some near-term volatility in Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) stock over the foreseeable year, I do want to clarify that I'm not a long-term bear, but rather bullish over the long term. Despite a reasonable probability that iPhone sales won't be as strong as prior year, there's still hope in terms of other revenue-generating categories, long-term retention of Apple customers, and penetration into the smartphone market. It was only recently that Apple has taken meaningful share away from rivals, and I anticipate a pattern of installed base growth to continue despite weakening cyclical sales over the short term. Many can acknowledge that the mid-cycle update isn't the best, and quite frankly. Apple tends to do better when it launches the non-S line-up, as it tends to develop compelling feature sets over a two-year time frame, which increases the likelihood of device upgrades. In my prior article, I was worried the current generation smartphone wasn't a strong enough of an update from the 6 line-up, and many in the tech community mentioned that while force touch is a nice improvement, and a better camera does create better shots. It's not substantially better than the iPhone 6/6+. I figured better storage was going to happen in the current iPhone line-up as it would have bought time for the company to make substantial improvements to the iPhone 7. Instead, Apple took a pass on offering better memory configurations this year and is instead opting to move the entire product line down the pricing curve. The upcoming 4-inch model could be a game-changing device for Apple in terms of sales, so there might be upside despite headwinds from Q1'FY 2016. The phone won't be released until the first half of CY 2016, so relief in terms of cheaper iPhone sales won't arrive for a while. Between January of 2012 and June of 2013, AAPL fell by roughly 45% from its peak. Well, what happened? Apple's gross margin fell from a peak of 47.5% to a low of 37.5%. Profitability declined considerably, and the company's sales growth dipped into the teens. Its iPhone growth fell below the market's high expectations, as growth decelerated from 133% year over year to 28% year over year revenue between Q1 FY 2013 and Q1 FY 2012. Meaningful deceleration in sales is enough to stifle investor optimism. Furthermore, net income remained flat, so the argument over Apple's waning profitability in conjunction with uncertainty over a recovery dragged the price to irrational levels. It took an entire year and a half before investors were able to revisit the $100 price level after having bought near the peak. For the most part, production plans are very closely correlated to actual sales. Sure, there might be some variance, but the correlation coefficient is .95. There might be differences in the number of phones sold into the channel, and the timing of those sales into the channel may affect quarterly cut-off dates. However, the most important thing to notice is the rapid drop-off in production going into Q1'FY 16 when compared to Q1'FY 15 (it's way worse when compared to prior year). In other words, the reduction in production may be partially attributed to the production of smaller iPhones, but is also being mitigated by weakness in demand. There could be some unit growth in CYQ4'15, but I'm starting to become more hesitant on anticipating such a favorable outcome as other channel-checking analysts like Ming-Chi Kuo anticipates iPhone shipments of 70-75 million in the December quarter. Credit Suisse anticipates shipments of around 80 million units. However, the reduction in average selling prices will drag revenues as consumers have transitioned to buying the prior generation models. I create a financial model to rationalize the momentum of various revenue categories, and cost drivers. My stance may be interpreted as borderline pessimistic or overly realistic. However, I think it's important to anticipate pricing events by modeling a variety of outcomes, and selecting the most realistic outcome. What's driving my FY 2016 revenue estimate: Less iPhone demand could be partially offset with smaller iPhone models later this year, but would lower my own ASP assumption even further. Therefore, neutral impact, investors will have to wait until the next generation iPhone to see a meaningful unit growth. iPad revenue growth flat, weak shipments in line with historical patterns, channel check, and data from independent industry analysts. The segment's ASP increases from $464 to $563, driving flat revenue growth in the segment. iPad Pro shipments approximate to 7.81 million of iPad shipments. Weakness in PC demand offset by pricing gains at the low end. iPad Pro cannibalizes low-end PC demand, as such I anticipate pricing mix to improve, but unit growth to decline modestly. Both factors offset each other. Software and services continue to grow in line with the installed base growth. There could be upside to software services depending on the momentum from Apple Music, Apple Pay, and peer-to-peer payment services. Growth in Apple Care could also add upside as the upgrade program requires consumers to pay for additional support services. Apple Watch drives meaningful growth in the accessories segment offsetting weakness from iPod. The growth in Apple Watch offsets declining iPod sales. I operate on 20 million units for FY 2016. This segment offsets weakness in the remaining product categories. F/X reduces revenue by 5 percentage points, hence AAPL will likely report a modest decline in sales from prior year. Hedges are expected to roll off, and the amount of pricing recapture is mitigated by pricing sensitivity in emerging markets like China and India. What's driving my assumptions on cost for FY 2016: I anticipate similar gross margins to prior year. However, gross margin erosion seems probable if ASP mix worsens in the iPhone segment. Furthermore, the Apple Watch doesn't provide lift to gross margins, as such I'm borderline overly optimistic here. Operating cost increases modestly due to a shift in investment priorities for new products and services. The company will complete its new campus in Cupertino in late 2016. Headcount will increase over the course of 2016 to utilize the space. Continued investment into car-related technologies also drives my assumptions on cost. Most of these costs are concentrated in R&D. I calculate share buybacks at $38 billion (based on buyback authorization). 332 million share reduction, while aggressive, seems realistic given the cheap valuation Apple persistently trades at. I'm lowering my price target from $131 to $116.34. My base scenario factors in both weakening sales and earnings. I'm a little more optimistic than I should be given the prevailing data points. To factor in volatility/risk, I anticipate modest earnings multiple contraction. The valuation I assign already factors in weak fundamentals, however, the stock could easily fall below my target price following the announcement of sales and earnings for Q1'FY16. Investors have responded negatively in response to weak quarterly earnings calls in the past, but I'm not saying that the same pattern will happen from 2012. There's no denying that investors risk losing some money by holding shares following the announcement of next quarter earnings. Given the lagging impact of iPhone order cuts, investors should anticipate the company to meet expectations on Q1, but to offer weak guidance on Q2. It's hard to anticipate the exact degree to which the stock will fall, but history has shown that Apple's price falls after earnings in both good/bad quarters. The investment community is well aware of the degree to which AAPL is likely to beat or fall below expectations prior to the earnings announcement. The current valuation reflects some of this pessimism, but I anticipate more of this to be priced in upon Apple's management confirming investor suspicion of weakening sales on its outlook. Of course, the conference call will be that final nail in the coffin, and as such, it would be irresponsible for me to encourage readers to buy AAPL now as opposed to buying the stock after a weak Q1 performance. I continue to reiterate my hold rating as 2016 won't be Apple's best year. The momentum trade has died down, and I don't anticipate the stock to be as correlated to the S&P 500. Various data points from Morgan Stanley suggest that stocks have demonstrated the lowest inter-sector correlation. Performance dispersion has widened quite considerably, which implies that beta volatility isn't as accurate of an indicator to future returns. It's up to the individual skill of investors to select outperforming investments, but Apple's cash flow metrics and various other fundamental indicators are considered "high quality." The stock has traded at a discount relative to the S&P 500 for quite some time, and buying cheap is the mantra of many investors. There's the distinct possibility that the next quarter will shake out even weaker hands, therefore I'm hesitant to call this a core holding over the foreseeable 3 to 6 month period. I've also reduced my price target and rating to reflect these changes in my outlook. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
