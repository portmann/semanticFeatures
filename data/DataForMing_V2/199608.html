Ford Leads The Pack In September - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford saw a 23% increase in US auto sales in September 2015 compared to September 2014, which was ahead of other large auto manufacturers. The Ford Mustang saw the strongest September since 2007 as it looks to reclaim the best selling muscle car title from the Camaro in 2015. As the US economy stays strong, Ford is in an ideal position to take advantage of the booming US automotive market. Ford (NYSE: F ) announced September 2015 US vehicle sales of 222K, up 23% from the same month in 2014. This 23% increase came in slightly above expectations from analysts who were expecting an increase of 22%. Ford's large year-over-year increase was largely due to a late labor day, but it was the best retail results in September since 2004. More importantly, the increase led the pack as others reported monthly US vehicle sales - Toyota 16% (NYSE: TM ), Fiat Chrysler 14% (NYSE: FCAU ), and General Motors 12% (NYSE: GM ). These positive results for Ford come amidst an auto market that reached an annualized rate of 18.17 million units in September, which is the highest rate since July 2005. Furthermore, the year-over-year gain in September was 16%. Ford's impressive results from September are part of the strong second half that I have been expecting as a result of the new aluminum-bodied F-150 pickup reaching optimal inventory levels. It has become clear that as the US economy remains strong, Ford is in a great position to take advantage of the economy dependent auto market. The key to the company's turnaround has been the remodeling of the Ford F-150. The Ford F-150, which underwent a drastic model change to an aluminum body starting with this year's model, has seen tight inventory levels so far as the company has worked to configure their manufacturing plants. Because of the inventory constraints surrounding the new F-150 model, the company did not utilize heavy incentives to sell older models like competitors in the first half of 2015. However, the company has reached full production and saw a 28% increase in F-Series retail sales, which pushed total truck sales to their highest level in nine years. The F-Series pickup is the most popular vehicle in the US and is key to the company's future. The Mustang continued to build an impressive case for comeback car of the year in 2015. Mustang sales were at their highest September level since 2007 and continue to build its case to reclaim the title of bestselling muscle car in 2015. This is a title the company has not held since before the 2010 Chevrolet Camaro was introduced. During September, Mustang sales were up a whopping 199% with over 96,000 Mustangs sold year to date in 2015 compared to only nearly 60,000 year to date in 2015. I believe this is the resurgence of the Mustang and should provide long-term growth for the company in the reclaimed segment. While the turnaround looks like it gained traction in August and continued to thrive in September, there are contingencies that could derail the company's momentum. These include the overall health of the US economy, labor negotiations with the UAW, and emergence of new competitors in the auto industry. If there was an event or condition that forced the US economy back into slowing growth territory or a global recession, it would definitely have a major impact on Ford. Additionally, labor negotiations with UAW are key to Ford's bottom line as it employs more than 52,000 US UAW hourly employees . It is important that management keeps these costs under control and does not let costs get out of control. Finally, with new companies working to produce technology infused vehicles such as Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ), Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), it is important that Ford stays ahead of this curve and doesn't fall behind when it comes to technology used in the vehicle. Management should not be looking at the industry as theirs to lose, but they should rather be seeing it as an opportunity to lead the way. It was no secret that Ford was losing ground to competitors due to the inventory restrictions as most consumers purchase a vehicle when needed instead of waiting for the newest model. Because of this and other factors, the Ford resurgence is not guaranteed. However, it is encouraging to see Ford leading the pack again. This shows me as an investor that the new F-150's results are positive and the high end models are selling well, which is creating a lot of optimism around the new model going forward. Given this long-term optimism with Ford, I am extremely encouraged by the US sales results in September. I continue to be excited about the company's future as the new aluminum bodied F-150 is seeing quick turnaround times, the recent shift in consumer sentiment to higher profit margin vehicles, and the strong sales of the Mustang. With consumers purchasing more expensive vehicles, it will allow Ford to report stronger top line and bottom line growth in the end of 2015. I remain bullish on the US automobile industry and believe Ford has a strong product mix to take advantage of the growing market. I will continue to enjoy the near 5% dividend yield as the company prepares to be successful in the long term. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
