Microsoft understand that companies must invest today, even if their financial statements are punished by outdated accounting rules, if they wish to be profitable in the future. All in all, Microsoftâ€™s unique capital stock and commitment to investing for the future should enable them to continue to delivering impressive results for shareholders. Last week, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) released the latest Skype desktop update which is bringing reality closer to science fiction. The update brought to life real-time translation of six languages: English, Spanish, French, German and Mandarin. A universal translator was once just in the imaginations of Star Trek writers or in the world of Douglas Adam's Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy but it is now just Skype phone call away. And if users wish to converse through Skype's messaging platform than 50 different language translations are available. The Skype Translator is continuously improving as more people use it and it leverages Microsoft's cloud capabilities in order to access huge amounts of data and processing power. The Skype Translator has been a project that has been in the works for over a decade and while Skype has only been under the Microsoft umbrella for four years, long-term strategic investments in something Microsoft is very comfortable with. Microsoft understand that companies must invest today, even if their financial statements are punished by outdated accounting rules , if they wish to be profitable in the future. Microsoft has been a consistent investor in research and development (R&D) and other intangible assets since the company was incorporated. In the latest fiscal year, Microsoft spent 13% of its sales on R&D and another 6.7% of its sales on other intangible investments. They spend over 3x as much on intangible investments as they do on traditional capex. On average over the past 20 years, Microsoft has spent about 15% of its sales on R&D and has spent about 8% of its sales on other intangible assets. All of these investments in intangible assets has led to a gigantic reservoir of long-term productive assets that are currently invisible to the financial community. When we adjust Microsoft's financial statements for intangible assets, we see that Microsoft actually has about $50 billion more in assets on their balance sheet than what is recorded under traditional accounting rules. A substantial 20% of Microsoft's assets are in productive long-term intangible assets. The last point to make on Microsoft's balance sheet is that it remains in outstanding financial condition. Microsoft has over 60% of its capital in cash has a net debt position of -42.8%. The unique capital stock that Microsoft has created has generated impressive results for Microsoft over the years. Microsoft has managed to grow sales by an incredible 14.3% annually over the past two decades and increase earnings per share and cash flow by about 12% a year. Microsoft delivers a very impressive 38.2% intangible-adjusted return on their invested capital (and a huge 107.6% if you use unadjusted data) and 18.5% return on equity. Given the sheer size of Microsoft, it is almost hard to believe that they are able to remain so productive with their capital. From a valuations perspective, there seems to be further upward potential. Microsoft is currently trading at 7.1x intangible-adjusted cash flow, 3.8x sales and 2.7x intangible-adjusted book value. It is trading at a 10% discount to the average stock in the MSCI World (NYSEARCA: URTH ) on a price to cash flow basis and is trading at a 50% discount to its own 10-year average price to intangible-adjusted book value ratio. It is also trading at a 20% discount to its 10-year average price to sales ratio. Microsoft also pays out a dividend yield that is yielding more than a 30-year US treasury bond at 3.1%. Lastly, Microsoft's relative point and figure chart against the MSCI All-Country World Index (NASDAQ: ACWI ) shows that Microsoft is firmly in an uptrend against the overall equity market. After forming a nice, long base for several years, Microsoft has been in an outperforming trend since 2014. There are no signs that this should abate anytime soon. All in all, Microsoft's unique capital stock and commitment to investing for the future should enable them to continue to delivering impressive results for shareholders. Valuations remain tame relative to historical levels while growth continues on at impressive clip. It would be worthwhile for investors to give this stock market bellwether a close look.
