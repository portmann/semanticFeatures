I Bought A Fitbit, Buy Fitbit? - Fitbit, Inc. (NYSE:FIT) | Seeking Alpha The market assumes Fitbit has no long-term future against the Apple Watch. Fitbit has focused on the health niche, and will expand upward from there at a fraction of the Watch price. There is a huge difference between the Fitbit (NYSE: FIT ) activity tracker and the Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Watch. One is a sensor, the other a PC. Or there is a huge difference between the Fitbit and the Apple Watch. One sells millions, the other just pretends to. At this point, both bull and bear are right. The Fitbit IPO has done more for its inexpensive line of activity trackers than any event so far. The IPO has boosted the company's public profile, and probably sold a ton of the devices. After watching my wife and daughter go crazy for their Fitbits, I recently gave in, because the new Fitbit HR device can measure my heart rate in real time , and at 60, I would like to give the paramedics a heads-up on my heart attack. It was also cheap enough for a Father's Day present. The Fitbit HR is both incredibly simple and very limited, its functions being restricted to the time, your steps, your heart rate and serving an app on sleep. But then my smartphone rings, and hmmm, the thing is shaking like I just walked 5 miles and telling me who called. The point is that the Fitbit is aiming at the Apple Watch with a bottom-up approach. It's providing only the functions Fitbit defines as killer apps - health monitoring information - while hinting at multiple generations of replacements that can do much more. By contrast, the Apple Watch intends to be a complete adjunct to your iPhone from the start. It comes with thousands of apps, including maps, weather, music, calendar, communications, and camera functions. This is just the start, as the Apple WatchKit and Swift programming language promise a flood of such things real soon now. So why won't Fitbit quickly go the way of the Palm Pilot? It starts with pricing, which only starts at $349 with Apple, but should also include the cost of an iPhone and its monthly mobile bill. Fitbit has focused on the health niche people care about most, with no additional cost, and prices that max out at a fraction of that of the Apple product, starting at well under $100. By starting organically, with a single basic function, and keeping the price low, Fitbit sold 11 million units last year . It is assumed that it, and other activity trackers, "have" to fall to Apple over time, because once people have one thing they want more, and Apple already does that, so people will switch within a year or two. Maybe. The stock is certainly speculative. A $6.69 billion market cap on 2014 revenue of $745 million? True, it brought $131 million of that - 17.5% - to the net income line, but that means you're paying nine time sales and 51 times net for a company whose margins have to be getting squeezed as it pushes through a market with total demand that may not exceed 100 million units. On the other hand, Fitbit may be the last great opportunity for a company like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) or Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) to get ahead of Apple in a major category, and those numbers aren't that much different from what you'd pay for a good cloud computing outfit, or even Red Hat (NYSE: RHT ), presently trading at 51 times earnings. And do you know that the company behind the Palm Pilot, BlackBerry (NASDAQ: BBRY ), once sold at over $200/share? It may be a speculative momentum stock, but Fitbit might also be a speculative buy even at these levels. Source: I Bought A Fitbit, Buy Fitbit? Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL, GOOGL.
