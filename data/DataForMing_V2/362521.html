Yahoo jumps on news Verizon moving ahead with bid; Google considering as well - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha Apr  7 2016, 14:58 ET | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) shares have jumped into positive ground, now up 1.2%, on news that Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) is proceeding with a bid for its core assets. Alphabet unit Google ( GOOG , GOOGL ) is also weighing its own bid, Bloomberg reports, with interest also showing up from Bain Capital and TPG. Time Inc. (NYSE: TIME ) is still out there as well. AT&T (NYSE: T ) and Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) are losing interest, Bloomberg also said, with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) also deciding it wouldn't bid. Updated 3:06 p.m.: After a big spike into positive ground, Yahoo shares have gone negative again, -0.1%. Verizon is said to value the core business at less than $8B, vs. Yahoo's hopes for a $10B valuation, and has engaged three banks. "Verizon is said to value the core business at less than $8B" any idea on how that would translate in stock price? just under 1B shares so every $1B they get should raise the share price $1 as the core is currently valued at ZERO priceless. That "DIRE" financial statement was so bogus .........just a  scare tactic by a bidder concerned about a bidding war. Bring it on.
