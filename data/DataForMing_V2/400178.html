Apple: The Technology Laggard - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple needs to upgrade its technology to drive hardware sales. Scaling back compatibility is the first necessary step. Fiscal 2016 is going to be a tough year for Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), something hard for even the most bullish on the name to say. The iPhone 6s just hasn't worked out as expected, and sales of other products have not been able to fill the gap. As the company starts to look forward to its annual developers conference, which forms the basis for the next product cycle, it is clear that Apple needs to remember one key word: technology. There are a couple of points behind this argument, so let me start with one that isn't mine. Fellow SA contributor Mark Hibben had an excellent article Wednesday talking about iOS compatibility in relation to device replacements. He provided the following graphic showing how iOS 9 can work on an assortment of Apple devices. While I know that there aren't too many devices as old as the iPhone 4s still in use, providing too much backward compatibility is likely hurting the upgrade cycle. In my opinion, Apple should only put its newest operating system on a maximum of three device lines. So for instance, the next OS that comes out, designed for the iPhone 7, should only work for the iPhone 6 and 6s lines (plus SE). Cutting this to two device lines would probably be even better, but maybe that can happen down the road. Such a drastic change from the current strategy may be too extreme for one year. There is a two-fold benefit here, and it doesn't just relate to iPhones, it can work with other products like the iPad as well. First, Apple can push consumers to upgrade to new products. The second part is a potential and/or situation. The company may be able to save a little money by not having to support so many devices on the newest OS, or potentially that money can be shifted to providing a better user experience for a smaller amount of users on the newest OS (perhaps a little of both even). If Apple wants to keep backward compatibility for a number of older devices, it perhaps could charge users to upgrade to the newest OS, but I don't know how successful that would be. In terms of overall technology, Apple needs to give its devices strong enough specifications if it wants consumers to upgrade. Apple finally went to 2 GB of RAM for instance on the iPhone 6s, but Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) had gone to 3 GB of RAM months earlier with the S6. In fact, Samsung has gone to 4 GB of RAM on the S7, according to specs . There are consumers out there that are not technologically savvy, and will only look right at the numbers - so they will side with the Samsung phone(s) that show more impressive specs. One thing I've argued in the past, and I think is critical for the iPhone 7, is Apple finally deciding to ditch the base level 16GB storage. Even though going to a 32GB base will be a little more expensive, this needs to be done. Apple did a good job of getting iPhone 6 buyers to jump to 64GB and higher storage models, but that won't always work. I was okay with a 16GB base for the SE model this year, mainly because Apple was focusing on price point, but I think it would be borderline criminal for the iPhone 7 to not start at 32GB. Perhaps Apple could also release a 32GB model of the SE at a $449 price point to help offset some margin issues as well. Apple will do the usual routine of touting how much better the processor is for the iPhone 7, along with certain other specs. We also know that the camera will be a huge upgrade from the 6 line, which is the majority of consumers Apple will be targeting for upgrades. But especially in the changing US market, the company needs to do a strong job of communicating why a consumer needs this phone. If I have an iPhone 6 that works fine currently, and I already own the device, why should I go out and spend $25 or $30 a month for two years, in addition to the wireless service cost, just to get the iPhone 7? That's a key message Apple needs to figure out. There are those out there that will argue Apple has a technology problem, and lagging sales of the iPhone and iPad lend credence to that notion. When you make premium products that last for many years, upgrade cycles stretch out. Apple needs to reduce backward compatibility and improve the specs on newer devices to drive upgrades on a more consistent basis. This process will start next month at WWDC, and how it works out for the iPhone 7 cycle will be key to determining if Apple shares can rebound.
