How Facebook "Accidentally" Blocked DNC Email Leak Scandal | Zero Hedge Submitted by Everett Numbers via TheAntiMedia.org, Once again, the impartiality of Facebook’s news feature is being called into question. This time, the social network claims it“accidentally” obstructed all links to the leaked Democratic National Committee emails published by Wikileaks just ahead of the party’s convention. This past Friday morning, the infamous publisher of anonymous leaks released nearly 20,000 internal emails between members of the formal governing body of the Democratic Party. The news, where it was seen,  provoked outrage , especially among supporters of Bernie Sanders, who was shown to have received unfair treatment by officially impartial party operators. While social media outlets have helped facilitate the spread of uncovered information in the past, Facebook is no trusted ally of Wikileaks . “@Facebook is blocking #DNCLeak email links,” Wikileaks tweeted Saturday evening, following other individual reports of Facebook suppressing the documents hours earlier.“Monday is the Democratic National Convention.” In a reply about three hours later, Twitter user @SwiftOnSecurity said,“@wikileaks Facebook has an automated system for detecting spam/malicious links, that sometimes have false positives. /cc @alexstamos” Then, without elaborating, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos replied to both tweets: “It’s been fixed,” Stamos said. A Facebook representative attempted to clarify, telling Gizmodo, “Like other services, our anti-spam systems briefly flagged links to these documents as unsafe. We quickly corrected this error on Saturday evening.” But tech blogs aren’t just letting this go. The Next Web said Facebook’s correction “is great — but also not really the point,” adding that there seems to be a “very tight reign on what’s allowed on Facebook.” Complaining about Facebook is nothing new, but this episode of newswire censorship amounts to more than ignored demands for a Dislike button. In May, former employees of the social networking service blew the whistle on how news stories and trends were generated on the platform. Instead of an unbiased algorithm, human “curators” were revealed to be making decisions on what deserved to be a top headline. More recently, Facebook took down and re-uploaded a Facebook Live video showing the immediate aftermath of the police shooting death of Philando Castile — an anomaly the site chalked up to a “technical glitch,” TechCrunch reported . One of the more peculiar cases of Facebook post policing occurred in November 2015, when U.K. student Roua Naboulsi had a lengthy status update removed. Her criticism of the selective sentimentality over the terrorist mass shooting attack in Paris, France, asking why the same response didn’t come for brown-skinned victims of terror, garnered 9,000 shares and 12,000 likes before Facebook took it down, RT reported . In a twist, Facebook also faced harsh criticism for what it refused to censor earlier this month; it shared a graphic Instagram video of victims in the Bastille Day attack in Nice, France, proving that as egregious as Facebook’s latest censorship campaign may be, it is merely yet another expression of the same pattern.

I stopped  caring about this moment of truth moment, though, about a decade ago  when I realized that it would make no difference; to wit: Democrat  voters simply do not care if their elected officials are out and out  criminally insane and Republican voters are too stupid to see that their elected officials are criminally insane. FGH MisterMousePotato Jul 27, 2016 3:39 PM Bay of Pigs GadExp Jul 27, 2016 3:15 PM I posted the video to Clinton Cash and got TWO likes and ZERO comments from 382 friends. The sheep don't care and refuse to acknowledge the truth. malek Bay of Pigs Jul 27, 2016 3:33 PM Captain Chlamydia GadExp Jul 27, 2016 3:16 PM I did that too. FB kicked me off THREE TIMES. Yes, I insulted the King of the Netherlands, yes, I questioned certain affairs of IsraÃ«l, yes, I expressed concerns about America's Deep State, yes, I used EXPLICIT LANGUAGE.  83_vf_1100_c Captain Chlamydia Jul 27, 2016 3:46 PM Maybe post links to ZH. You can say fuck or Jooz or nigger or the C word (I'm a bit prudish about that one) and not get kicked or redacted. Bay of Pigs 83_vf_1100_c Jul 27, 2016 4:01 PM You post ZH links and you are branded a "conspiracy theorist" or worse. People really don't want the truth on Facebook or anywhere else. They prefer a steady dose of cognitive dissonance, normalcy bias with a dash of Stockholm Syndrome.

The managing partner of ACCEL is a man named James W Breyer. James Breyer was on the Board of the National Ventures Capital Association. A washington thinktank agency. He served personally with a man named Gilman Louie.  Gilman Louie is the founder and CEO of In-Q-TEL.  In-Q-TEL is a non-profit venture capital firm, a firm run by the Central Intelligence Agency peddling-fiction HelluvaEngineer Jul 27, 2016 3:16 PM This is without getting into the deep state funding through slush funds. Also the invaluable help of the alphabet soup agencies. Maybe data center storage and backup concessions, bandwidth. Etc, etc, yada yada. L Bean HelluvaEngineer Jul 27, 2016 4:07 PM Pokemon Go too,  which is an remake of an earlier In-Q-tel "game", and a cleverly crowd-sourced total spectrum dominance app which gives .gov detailed pictures of every square in of the ... well, the entire "civilised" world by luring smartphone users to photograph their surroundings whilst they hunt for fiat nostaglia-tokens. Those updates arrive on your smart phone over the public airwaves, which are regulated. But the tech people and the cable companies that need satellite downlinks to get their content to you want you to think that you have no say. And their front men in the government will pretend as well, so long as nobody makes a fuss about it. You mean lying is not just forbidden, but would also get seriously and sincerely prosecuted, if the people only realized their say??
