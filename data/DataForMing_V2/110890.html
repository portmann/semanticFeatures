How Will The Chinese Stock Market Crash Affect Apple? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Since June 12, the Shanghai Composite Has Lost An Appalling 32%. Apple's Chinese Market May Suffer A Significant Loss in Revenues Due To A Potential Economic Slowdown. I urge investors to consider the potential consequences a stock market crash in China may have on Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) future revenues. This article is not intended to be sensationalistic or bombastic. Instead, I hope to start a discussion on a subject that may not have been considered in order to work towards a collective understanding. Apple has one of the largest cash reserves with over 194 Billion dollars , and Apple has one of the largest market caps at over 724 Billion dollars. Apple's powerhouse marketing strategies coupled with its deeply loyal fan base indicate it will easily survive a crash in a foreign market. With that being said, a steep market sell-off may indicate a deeper economic slowdown in China. Apple relies on the serious cashflows it receives from one of its largest growth markets. This slowdown could cause Chinese consumers to consider more affordable alternatives to real Apple products in order to save money. Apple could potentially lose ground in one of its most rapidly expanding markets, and ultimately this might hurt Apple's future growth. The Chinese stock market is in trouble. Over 700 companies, accounting for nearly 25% of market have stopped trading in order to "self preserve." Prices are in free fall, yet the trigger in China's crash is perplexing. Growth, while slowing, has seemed to stabilize. The recent crash has brought prices back to March levels, and the market is still up on the year. Other asset markets, however, are heating up. The banking sector seems calm as money markets rates remain low. Property continues to perform well. What is fascinating (and frightening) about the crash is how China has responded. Policy makers seem to have entered full-blown panic mode. Opposed to just cutting rates (a reasonable and often effective action under the right circumstances) Regulators capped short selling. Pension funds pledged to buy more stocks. The government suspended IPOs in order to restructure and revise stocks in an attempt to limit supply and drive up price. The apparent desperation may be a sign that officials foresee a looming economic catastrophe, and are trying to mitigate the damage before facing political and social upheaval. The most disturbing part of the crash is how Chinese policyholder have tried to assert their own influence over the market in a show of force. The desire to control behavior can be detrimental to the efficiency of a free-market economy. The push for economic intervention may result in inefficient measures taken to control losses that could worsen declining market conditions. Apple has outperformed expectations constantly since its inception. Currently priced at 124.20, Apple's EPS is at 8.06 and P/E multiple is at 15.50. Apple's 1.68 dividend yield also increases their attractiveness. As I mentioned earlier, Apple has strong cash reserves and continues to innovate new ways to market and sell its products. The most recent product, the Apple Watch, is an example of how Apple effectively repackages and markets old ideas in a bold and innovative way. Interestingly Smart Watches have existed since IBM's (NYSE: IBM ) Watchpad in 2001. With 182.35 Billion dollars of revenue last year, Apple seems unstoppable at finding new markets to sell, innovate, and market its products. China has seen an explosion in demand for Apple products. With revenues increasing 70% year over year, China is now the third largest market for Apple products. Chinese revenues reached 16.1 Billion in Q1 alone, and based on current growth projections they will soon overtake Europe as the second largest market. Growth in Europe and America have remained steady at around 20 and 23 percent respectively. US revenues are massive with over 30 Billion in revenue in Q1, and Apple did an impressive 17.214 Billion in revenue in Europe. Apple's macro growth strategy is reliant on China. In fact, Apple's plan to sell gold plated phones is marketed directly at Chinese consumers. A crashing market in China may not be the end of the world for the Chinese economy. Chinese stocks represent 15% of total household financial assets, and 5% of total social financing. The subsequent reaction by political leaders in China, however, indicate the roots of potentially larger economic collapse. The housing boom may indicate unwillingness to invest in the markets, but rather to rely on a on real estate holdings instead. The current market reaction could further push China closer to a housing bubble that many believe has been a long time coming . The worst case scenario for Apple is that China collapses. Perhaps the slowdown has been indicative of a larger decline that has been growing for awhile, but the Chinese government may have been able to mask its full extent. In that case, Apple would lose steam in one of its largest growth markets. Apple could no longer count on 70% year over year growth in that region, unless it significantly lowered the cost of its products, which probably would not happen. Chinese consumers would likely substitute cheaper alternative s to Apple to satiate demand under the pain of decreasing employment and wages. Earnings projections that account for Chinese growth would be incorrect and would have to revised to account for newly projected cashflows. Apple would lose some value, and Apple would have to focus more on its primary market (US and Europe) as well as search for other emerging markets to capitalize on. Apple is not in significant danger, but it might lose a portion of one of its biggest emerging markets. Apple's growth plan may be subdued which ought to be projected in revenue growth models used to value the company. Apple's Chinese strategy is its biggest opportunity for growth going forward, but a slowdown in the Chinese economy could hurt Apple's ability to grow.
