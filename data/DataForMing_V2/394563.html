Apple: Why Icahn Is Wrong About China - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Carl Icahn announced he is out of Apple, pointing to problems with the Chinese government. The actions of the government suggest to some that it might block Apple from the home market. Carl Icahn has acknowledged selling off his Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) holdings and has pointed to "China's attitude" towards Apple as his principal concern. While Icahn regards the Chinese government as having unlimited power, in fact, the government is severely limited by economic realities, globalization, and its obligations as a member of the World Trade Organization. Apple needn't fear the government so much as legitimate competition from Chinese smartphone makers. Last summer, the bogeyman that haunted Apple investors was the Chinese economy, and the media were filled with all sorts of dire predictions, most of which never came true. At the time, I argued that the state of the Chinese economy wasn't nearly as bad as was being portrayed, and was eventually vindicated in Apple's September and December quarter results. In the September 2015 quarter, revenue from Greater China grew by 99% y/y. In the December 2015 quarter, revenue bumped up sequentially by 47%. By the end of the year, the thesis that the economic sky was falling in China had been thoroughly discredited. Carl Icahn has kicked off for the Summer of 2016 a new Chinese Bogeyman, that of the pernicious Chinese Government. Icahn said You worry a little bit - and maybe more than a little - about China's attitude. . . [The Chinese government could] come in and make it very difficult for Apple to sell there. . . You can do pretty much what you want there. It's obvious that this will be the new thesis that drives the stock down during the summer. This image of the government plays upon some longstanding and understandable fears and suspicions of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in the US. The government is regarded as a totalitarian Communist regime that has unlimited control of its people. The human rights record of the PRC is, in the eyes of most of us in the democratic West, deplorable. But human rights abuses are by no means the sole province of the PRC. In any case, the PRC's power over foreign companies doing business in China is far from unlimited. The PRC is constrained by the economics of globalization as well as the specific requirements of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( OTC:GATT ), to which the PRC is signatory as a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO). The PRC worked very hard to gain membership in the WTO and China has benefited enormously since the PRC became a member in 2001. This is not to say that the PRC's compliance with GATT has been exemplary. Far from it. China has often skirted the bounds of flagrant violation, but only just. Perhaps the most flagrant trade abuse by China was the trans-shipment of technology to Iran by ZTE , the Chinese telecomm equipment maker. Sanctions imposed by the US were subsequently lifted "temporarily" on March 21 following protest from the PRC. Since the sanctions prevented US companies such as Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) from doing business with ZTE, the lifting of sanctions was as much for the benefit of US businesses as it was the Chinese. The ZTE incident really demonstrates the interdependencies now inherent in globalization. Besides formal trade requirements, China is highly dependent on its trade relationships with countries such as the US. Apple is the premier example. Apple's manufacturing partner, Hon Hai Precision (Foxconn) is the largest private employer in China , with 1.4 million workers. As I've pointed out, Foxconn derives between 60-70% of its revenue from Apple, depending on the time of year. This makes Apple indirectly one of the largest private employers in China. Any attempt by the PRC to interfere with Apple's business in China that would be a flagrant violation of GATT would have dire consequences for the Chinese economy. At the very least, a direct attack on Apple would mean US sanctions, as well as the removal of all those manufacturing jobs to some other locale, such as India. It might be argued that domestic manufacturers would be able to make up the deficit from a Foxconn pull out. Not really. The PRC would gain the jobs due to Apple's share of the Chinese smartphone market, about 11-12 million units last quarter. But it would lose Apple's share of the global market, worth another 30-40 million units. So roughly 3/4 of the jobs at Foxconn would go away, never to return. The domestic Chinese brands would never be able to achieve the global market penetration that Apple has. They would be even further disadvantaged if Foxconn moved its manufacturing to an even lower cost area, such as India or Vietnam. My interpretation of the shutdown of the iBooks Store and iTunes Movies by the PRC State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television is that this was about the PRC's ongoing attempt to censor Internet traffic within China. It was not about disadvantaging Apple specifically. All technology companies, foreign or domestic, have to contend with the PRC's policies on the matter. Most likely, the PRC attempted to reach a "compromise" with Apple in which it would be allowed to ban books and movies it considered undesirable. Undoubtedly, Apple refused. This was a case of values trumping economics, and I doubt anyone in the US would argue with Apple's choice. The data currently available on the Chinese smartphone market does not suggest that Apple is being singled out. Far from it. Some of Apple's competitors, such as Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) and Lenovo ( OTCPK:LNVGY ) (incorporated in Hong Kong) fared worse than Apple in the March quarter. A year ago, the top five smartphone vendors were, according to IDC , Apple, Xiaomi (Private: XI ), Huawei, Samsung and Lenovo, as shown in the table below: We don't yet have data from IDC for 2016 Q1, but according to data released by Strategy Analytics , Apple fell to 5th place, but Samsung and Lenovo didn't make the cut of the top five: The growth of Chinese brands within the domestic market was inevitable. Undoubtedly, the PRC is doing whatever it can within the limits of GAAT (and probably a little beyond) to promote domestic smartphone makers. That's just a fact of the competitive landscape in China. Apple's y/y sales decline of about 15% was not that severe, but companies such as OPPO and Vivo grew dramatically, forcing Samsung and Lenovo out of the top five. Apple suffered a 26% y/y decline in revenue from Greater China in the March quarter, but even then, China remained the second largest source of revenue at $12.486 billion after the Americas. As Tim Cook pointed out in the conference call on April 26 , Apple's performance in Greater China was more driven by Hong Kong than the mainland. In the PRC, Apple revenue was down only 11%, better than the iPhone unit sales decline would suggest. Apple faces a tougher competitive landscape for iPhone, not merely in the PRC but throughout the world. Apple's decision to be more cost competitive, as I recently outlined , is absolutely the right response. Apple has no need, nor reason, to wither and become the niche player it was in the 90s. The demand for the iPhone SE may well indicate that it can actually reap more total profit by pricing its phones lower. Apple is just starting to probe the demand curve at the lower price points. Apple's engaging in a price war with its competitors does carry some risk. My use of the word war was meant to convey that the outcome is by no means certain. This is the real reason Icahn bailed out. Apple might no longer be the cash cow he wanted it to be. But Apple has tremendous advantages in technology and financial resources. I'm convinced Apple can win. I remain long Apple and recommend it as a buy for investors with a 3-5 year investment time frame. Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL, QCOM.
