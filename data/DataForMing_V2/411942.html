Tim Cook maps Apple's vision for India - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha May 22 2016, 10:05 ET | About: Apple Inc. (AAPL) | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor After opening a development center in his first visit to the country, Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Tim Cook concluded a four-day trip to India  on Saturday by meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. "Cook shared Apple's future plans for India," according to a statement from the Indian government. "He spoke of the possibilities of manufacturing and retailing in India." The visit comes at a crucial time for the tech giant as it looks for new growth markets following its first-ever quarterly decline in iPhone sales. - Cookie finally decided that India is a market worth taking seriously in 2016. Too little, too late again for the Apple?? - Cookie "invested" $1 billion of shareholder funds for a fractional share of a money losing PROFITLESS China based taxi hailing app that also has questionable legal standing in the PRC. Perhaps Cookie could have started Apple's own taxi hailing service app in the PRC for 1/10th the cost of what he threw at Didi. Dejavu 1999 mindless acquisitions? - It was discovered that one of Buffet's underlings (and all Berkshire shareholders) got royally burned by buying $1billion AAPL at inflated prices just prior to Apple's horrendous ER and the solid leaks concerning a likely DOA IP7 launch in September. Even though it was a relatively small new position relative to Berkshire standards, Buffet must be a little more than upset at that miss-step. Great example of how even the big playas can drink too much coolaid, and how their huge research operations cannot even figure out how the next quarter ER result will look. Gotta wonder if Berkshire has sold out of its position already? it just seems a little strange. ...almost like he is trying give investors reasons why the stock a buy.   this is not at all what Steve Jobs did... he let products speak for themselves. I'm sure you must be a billionaire right now since you pretend to be way smarter than Cookie, Buffett and everyone else in the world. -even by 2020, 50% of India will still be using 2G speeds. India isn't even in the first inning yet. Apple has it absolutely right. Their market share will closely mimic the amount of GOOD 4G available. -Apple spent 1 billion dollars to gain valuable information on 11 million rides *per day.* If you're building an Apple Car, and need extremely valuable data, spending a billion dollars is virtually free. Especially if you start seeing iPads pop up in these vehicles. -Buffett's stock picks generally go down before they go up. He likes to ride the cost down for awhile and, in case you haven't noticed, he's been pretty successful using this approach (as have his disciples). His time horizon is far more than 1 or 2 months. I'm sure he/they will be quite happy in a few years when Apple is hovering around $200. The float is evaporating at a pace that almost needs no growth for this to occur. Growth would only expedite this occurrence. Sounds Like Cook should be interviewing you for a position on his management team. You have all the answers that he is searching for. He is at the right time as India is starting to upgrade it's networks from Edge to fully deliver 3G and higher data transfer. An iPhone is not much use on a slow network. Exposethetruth.com didn't I see you in a documentary about exposing the truth of aliens from Mars visiting Earth and manipulating our gene pool? Lay off the coolaid and take off the rose-gold tinted shades for a minute. Blind sheep are not good investors. Taxi hailing is not rocket science, but perhaps the opposite in fact. Thats there is plenty of competition, no moats, and they loose money hand over fist. Buffet doesn't like tech and Berkshire's long underwater IBM position is an example of why he avoids it. His underlings are on the hook for the AAPL position. Even if only Dheli, Mumbai and Chinai have 3g and the rest of India didn't have phones, it would make India one of the biggest smartphone markets in the world, and it should have been taken seriously years ago. Hahaha! You were being mocked and you don't even know it, expose.  That says enough about you ability to grasp the simplest concept.  But don't feel bad, most children don't understand sarcasm either. Didi is in 400 cities in China, Uber is in 45! The one billion bucks is a chip shot for Apple, but it will help Apple resume iBooks and movies. Also Didi will be a customer for Apple's autonomous cars in the future. India needs to be the landing place for used iPhones.  In order to fully execute that they have to appease the Indian gov.  This probably won't be enough but is a start. Excellent comment!  Is it true the Berkshire apple investment that pretty much made the stock recover was bought at inflated prices? Inflated? No, for the price before earnings. AAPL price can be much higher than what they paid and still not inflated. I'm sure they did their dd before investing this much money. certainly makes sense. india certainly will be a consumer market, but the most importantly, a source of engineers. there is a reason why the middle class will be exploding there -- more productivity more education. I am back in AAPL as I feel it is back to undervalued.   India is a vast market with a great tech class that love cell phones. Nice to hide behind behind a number as a name lol.   We all invest because we have a feeling meaning an opinion that something is either undervalued (buy) or over valued (sell)  OR write puts (under) or CC (over). Um, wake-up, Yesterday.  We live in a global economy.  For better or worse it is what it is.  All companies must go to where they can build there products in the most cost efficient way to be competitive.  This is not an Apple phenomenon.  This is every global company on the planet. Added the new model which creates mid-tier pricing for India and attack Android...getting set for the iPhone 7 launch...will no doubt announce new software innovations shortly, further expansion of Apple TV, health, and Apple Home, and continued progress on the car, and who knows...maybe an acquisition or two?  Maybe even a Liquid Metal iPhone housing?  Did I mention the services business?  The Apple Architecture is now entrenched and growing.  And if Apple dividend were ever to cross a 3% yield, they'd change out their entire growth stock ownership to value stock ownership.  And WHEN the tax deal occurs, they'll be bringing home between $100-$200 billion. PE is nominally 10.5X and that's BEFORE adjusting for cash and backing out the share from buybacks this quarter.  Yep, Apple's dead.  You guys continue giving your shares away so I can load up at spring sale prices.   I appreciate the help.  I remember the same troll invective back when Apple was selling at $40. Biased comment. Not insightful. He has no idea what people at Berkshire are doing. No idea what next phone is. And no idea about what a taxi co. Is worth in China. It's okay if he dislikes Apple It says that "Cook shared Apple's Future Plans for India" with the Prime Minister and the Indian Government. It would be "nice" if he would take the time and effort to explain them to current Shareholders as well as the Investment community, especially Institutional investors. I, for one, and as a shareholder would love to know what Apple (Cook) plans on doing in India. I have not been able to find a definitive article outlining his initiatives other than hiring 4,000 people (for something?) and building some type of Technical Center (for something?) and that has all been thru news services and not Apple. Cook likes to communicate with everybody in the World (Pope, Chinese President, Indian Prime Minister, Obama, Cramer, GreenPeace, GBLT orgs., Awards Ceremonies, University speeches). I wish he could take the time to share some "Vision" with shareholders and possible future shareholders. I guess I will have to wait till he goes on 60 Minutes (TV show) again, and says absolutely nothing, about everything! Apple needs a better spokesperson or a CEO that is more willing to address the investment community with a narrative (Vision) outlining where he wants to take this company. I watched Zuckerberg do it, live, and the stock has responded well and shareholders know where they are at and also where they are going! Whenever I get to hear Cook speak, I walk away knowing less than what I thought I knew! LOL!
