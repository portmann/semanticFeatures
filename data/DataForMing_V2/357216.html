Reuters: Time considering private-equity team-up for run at Yahoo - Time Inc. (NYSE:TIME) | Seeking Alpha Apr  1 2016, 20:09 ET | About: Time Inc. (TIME) | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Time Inc. (NYSE: TIME ) -- considered a long-shot suitor for the core Internet assets of Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) -- is looking at partnering with private equity to make a run for the business, Reuters reports. The publisher has spent the past several months boosting its digital presence through a series of bolt-on acquisitions, with special focus on women and millennials. A partner in private equity would bolster Time's resources, considered insufficient in the face of interest from buyers that likely include Verizon, AT&T and Comcast alongside large P-E firms. Time's market cap is just $1.6B, while Yahoo may be seeking $10B for the assets. Here's an idea; Time buys the MM contract for just $1,000,000. MM can do for Time what she did for YHOO.  WIN/WIN/WIN. Yahoo would be very lucky to get $10 billion for the core internet assets (not counting stake in Yahoo Japan and BABA). Personally, I think they should take anything over $5 billion.
