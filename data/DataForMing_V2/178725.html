Pandora: Time To Sell? - Pandora Media (NYSE:P) | Seeking Alpha Company still losing money, diluting shareholders. One of the best stocks in recent months has been Pandora (NYSE: P ). Shares of the company have soared more than 50% since its Q2 earnings report, and they were helped on Monday by a favorable Copyright Royalty Board ruling. While the CRB news could prove to be a positive, I'm worried that this news was already priced in. With Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Music making its move in the space, I think investors may want to sell Pandora at this point. Back in July, Pandora issued strong Q2 results and gave solid guidance. Going into that report, shares were under $14 and now they are near $21 (hit $22.60 at Monday's high). As you can see from the chart below, this has pushed some of the stock's technicals to unreasonable levels, like its bollinger bands. With shares above the upper band, a pullback to the 50-day moving average (at $17.41 but rising) wouldn't be unreasonable. Next week, the free trial period for those who signed up for Apple Music at the start will end, and Apple will begin collecting a nice paycheck from users who continue with the service. I do think this will provide some stiff competition for the smaller Pandora. One article earlier this year did a comparison of the two services, detailing a number of extra features Apple Music contains, such as: Apple Music offers music video streaming. Apple Music is more costly at $9.99 per month or $14.99 for a 6-user family plan. Pandora costs just $4.99 or $55 for a year. The article above finishes with the following statement, one that I believe is key to the whole comparison: In any case, though, the extra cost of Apple Music for a single-user plan may still be worth it, as it looks to come with way more features than Pandora. Investors are betting on big growth for Pandora, with revenues expected to rise more than 30% this year. However, even with 25% revenue growth in the first half of 2015, the company still ended up producing a larger net loss. On a GAAP basis, Pandora lost more than $64 million in the first six months, up from a $40 million loss in the prior year period. If Pandora can't produce a profit when Apple isn't around, how soon can it get there with the technology giant now in the space? While Pandora's balance sheet is in good shape, free cash flow has also been questionable. Pandora's valuation also worries me at the moment. Shares go for about 51 times expected 2016 adjusted earnings, compared to a name like Sirius (NASDAQ: SIRI ) that goes for less than 26 times. While Sirius offers less potential growth, Sirius is also profitable and is buying back stock. Since the end of 2013, Pandora's outstanding share count has soared from 195.4 million to 212.3 million.

In the end, investors may want to look at taking some profits in Pandora, and those who believe in Apple Music may even want to consider a short position. Apple's music service offers more features, with a reasonable price if you purchase the family plan. Pandora hasn't been able to record a profit yet, and shareholder dilution is rising by the quarter. With a stock up more than 50% since earnings, technicals also favor a pullback in the short term given a very rich valuation.
