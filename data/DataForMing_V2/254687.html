Selling Yahoo Core Would Cost YHOO Investors Triple-Digit Gains - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha YHOO performed well to reports that the company is considering a sale of its core assets. This would mean that YHOO is not moving forward with a spinoff of its Alibaba stake. Apparently, Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) investors like the idea of its core internet business being sold, with its Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) and Yahoo Japan stake being all that's left. The stock jumped 5.7% in response to this idea, a report from the Wall Street Journal, and then another by FT.com that Yahoo is actually considering it. However, investors need to hope that there is no such substance to these reports, and more importantly, view the stock gains in response to this report as detrimental to your future return in YHOO. First and foremost, many investors still lack a basic understanding of what transpired with the IRS earlier this year. Everyone knows that the IRS did not give Yahoo its blessing to proceed with the tax free spinoff. However, as I reported back in October, this really means nothing in regards to what Yahoo can do with its stake in Alibaba, or Yahoo Japan for that matter. Sure, Yahoo may have to argue its case for a tax-free spinoff over a longer period of time, or the company may ultimately end up in court. However, chances are it'll be years before a final ruling determines what if anything Yahoo has to pay (in taxes) from the spinoff. In retrospect, Yahoo can still do whatever it chooses with the shares it owns in Alibaba, and personally, I do believe that Yahoo will complete the tax-free spinoff and will have history on its side to avoid taxes. Hence, why should Yahoo be treated different than the many companies before it to spinoff assets the same way? Nevertheless, I fully expect Yahoo to spinoff Alibaba, and afterwards, I believe that Yahoo will be one of the best value investment opportunities of my lifetime, maybe ever. If Yahoo were to sell its core business instead of completing the BABA spinoff in early 2016, it would absolutely destroy shareholder value. Thus, YHOO should have fallen 5.7% after the WSJ's report on Wednesday, not the alternative. The reason all comes down to Yahoo's sum of parts. Now, you can look back at just about any Seeking Alpha article over the last year to read about the value of Yahoo's assets. While everyone values these assets slightly differently, the bottom line is that Yahoo's assets are worth significantly more than its current market capitalization. Once Alibaba is spunoff, the majority of Yahoo's market capitalization will be gone, and then what's left of Yahoo is everything minus 15% of Alibaba's outstanding shares. I said back in August that investors should hope YHOO underperforms BABA from this point forward, until the spinoff is complete. Here's why. Back in March, Yahoo's stake in Alibaba accounted for 75% of its market capitalization. On June 30, it was 85% . Right now, Yahoo's stake in Alibaba is worth $31.65 billion, or 99% of Yahoo's market capitalization! The reason is very simple: BABA has traded higher by 3.3% since June 30 while YHOO has fallen 9%. Therefore, Yahoo's BABA stake has become more valuable whereas its own market capitalization has become less valuable. As a result, if Yahoo will just move forward with its plan to spinoff its Alibaba stake, and it would be transparent in stressing this plan, then YHOO would be an absolute zero risk stock at its current price. In retrospect, YHOO has fallen because of the uncertainty surrounding its plan to profit on all of these valuable assets, and all that management needs to do is present a plan with conviction and Wall Street would buy it. The news on Wednesday might have moved the stock a little, but it does not add value for investors long-term. Think about it: If Yahoo's core business is worth $3 billion, is that more meaningful to Yahoo's stock price now, or after the spinoff is complete? Right now, Yahoo is a $32 billion company, but if that spinoff were to be done tomorrow, Yahoo would be a billion dollar company max! At that point, Yahoo would have a $3 billion core business, a 35% stake in Yahoo Japan worth $9 billion, and $7 billion in cash. If Yahoo's market capitalization were to be $1 billion after the spinoff, it would have to surge 19-fold just to reach fair value. Therefore, investors should almost assume that YHOO doubles, if not triples very quickly following the spinoff as Wall Street has no choice but to recognize this value. This fact perfectly illustrates why Yahoo should move forward on the spinoff and consider no other option. After all, what could a sale of its core business right now really do for its stock, with the company valued at $32 billion? Even if Yahoo got $4 billion for its core business, it would be hard to imagine a 20% pop. Meanwhile, moving forward with the spinoff, and holding its other assets means the strong likelihood for multi-bagger gains thanks to its underperformance in recent months, and thanks to nearly all of its current valuation being tied to that Alibaba stake. In other words, YHOO is set up perfectly to give investors massive returns after the spinoff, so long as management doesn't mess it up by selling its core business beforehand.
