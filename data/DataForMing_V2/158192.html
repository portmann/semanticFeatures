Amazon Underground: 450+ Free Android Apps with Free In-App Purchases â€” My Money Blog August 26, 2015 By Jonathan Ping 3 Comments If you have an Android smartphone or tablet, Amazon just released Amazon Underground , which adds a collection of 450+ apps which have agreed to be 100% free, including all in-app purchases.    Amazon will somehow pay the publishers based on how much time you spend use each specific app.   You pay nothing. Looking over the list of available apps , I see an Office document viewer, a photo editor, a mobile PDF scanner, and a bunch of games.   I don’t play games much so I can’t tell which are good, but I recognize a few like Cut the Rope, Angry Birds, and Fruit Ninja.   There are also several Disney apps for those with young children.   I don’t really understand why a Goat Simulator is the #1 featured app, but hey it’s free! It looks like it’s just Amazon running advertising in the app instead of the developer. See the section on “Interstitial” https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/underground/docs/understanding-amazon-underground “”When a user launches an Amazon Underground app for the first time, a welcome message in the form of an interstitial ad plays. In subsequent times that a user either launches or resumes the app, paid interstitial ads will also sometimes play. You do not need to do anything to enable these ads. Amazon  configures the ads when your app is published to Amazon Underground.”” Interesting, so an ad up to once every time you start a new app.   Interesting that the developer gets paid 0.2 cents per minute.   That could add up I suppose. Notify me of follow-up comments by email.
