Microsoft: Dell Datawatch Integration Puts Pressure On Power BI And Designer Summer Update - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Dell has integrated its Statistica platform with Datawatch data visualization technology, of which I believe to be the best in the business. This makes Statistica an even tougher comparable and an even stickier platform when it comes to rip and replace efforts by Microsoft. Still, Microsoft could integrate with Datawatch as well or simply buy the company to make its tech exclusive; I believe Microsoft must do one or the other. Microsoft also has its much anticipated summer update for Designer and it has yet to be seen how that will shape the competitive space. It's not time to panic on Power BI or Designer but the "gauntlet hath been thrown" by Dell who is aggressively trying to take market in BI and Design. Just under a week ago I wrote an article about a then soon to be closing Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Power BI Designer poll which Microsoft would use to finalize development of its "summer update " to the platform. This will be Microsoft's first major iteration update in a while as the company has moved, smartly so, in favor of the monthly burst updates it's been deploying - making smaller but more agile changes to the platform, also to its connected Power BI platform. I also opined that Microsoft should consider, in conjunction with the summer update, acquiring either via straight acquisition or licensing, a best of breed BI data visualization technology as this is the majority of the updates promised. One name in particular that I mentioned was Datawatch (NASDAQ: DWCH ) - a stressed but best of breed data visualization tech provider. It appears, unbeknownst to me at the time, that Dell (formerly DELL) had already realized the foundational need for data visualization as the basis of a value-prop for BI and Design platforms; Dell had closed an integration partnership with Datawatch for its Statistica BI platform. Statistica already was the single most used and turned to platform for cloud-based analytics projects (according to "Analytics and Business Intelligence in the Cloud," a report by research firm Enterprise Management Associates (EMA)) - adding a best of breed data visualization integration that also allows for self-service data preparation from structured and multi-structured sources (such as PDF and log files) as well as real-time streaming data will only further its stickiness and use cases. Being a Microsoft bull and a currently bearish leaning Datawatch analyst (a company I have hammered in the past for poor management) it pains me to plainly state that I don't believe there to be a comparable alternative. If Microsoft doesn't integrate with Datawatch, to which the exclusivity of the Statistica partnership is unknown - a real threat to the integration efforts, I believe it will operate at a second tier when it comes to Design and visualization. The facts are the facts regardless of my prior opinings and current feelings towards Datawatch management - its solution is the best for what it does. "Dell today leapfrogs their competition with a combined solution that brings their advanced analytics together with the self-service data preparation and visual data discovery that only Datawatch can deliver. This offering provides a tremendous value proposition in meeting current and emerging analytics requirements" Dell GM for Global Advanced Analytics John K. Thomson followed with: "Today more than ever, the ability of companies to compete hinges on using data to better understand the behavior of their customers, and, as such, advanced analytics capabilities have become a must have for any organization, including Dell. That's why we prioritized making such capabilities available to our customers and our company with the acquisition of StatSoft, and, in the year since, we've continued pushing the envelope. Dell's new partnership with Datawatch, in tandem with its aggressive cross-portfolio integration efforts, makes Statistica one of the most comprehensive, easy-to-use advanced analytics platforms on the market today." Again, I have to agree entirely with both. So, is it time to panic on Power BI and/or Designer? I don't think so. Microsoft still has a great platform combination and for those who aren't needing to be professional data scientists the combination works excellent and has much, much better aesthetics than Statistica. It also has a huge surrounding productivity suite that creates a funnel to Power BI and Designer that Dell doesn't have. Finally, Microsoft has its upcoming summer update that needs to be evaluated prior to declaring a winner in this first round of "shots fired". All of these matter. But for those long Microsoft (quite possibly and probably Tableau Software (NYSE: DATA ) longs should be paying attention as well) the Statistica powerhouse is a monster that deserves close and steady attention. I know I'll be more closely following the action on the private front at Dell going forward. For now, consider this an informational update to the competitive positioning of Power BI and Designer but Microsoft has its work cut out for it. That's for sure.
