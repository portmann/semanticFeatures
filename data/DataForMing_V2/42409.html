As the de minimus supply of Apple Watches meets the stupendous demand from wrists everywhere, The Daily Mash offers one satirically-conjured man's perspective of his first day wearing the device... He said: â€œI had it all planned out â€“ not saying anything about it, but then somebody just notices and goes â€˜is that the new Apple Watch?â€™. I would respond simply with a wry Clooney-esque smile and they would mouth the word â€˜awesomeâ€™. â€œI explained that it was the brand new Apple Watch and they went â€˜HAHAHAâ€™ in a really deliberately hurtful way. The accounts assistant said it was the opposite of a fanny magnet and everyone cracked up. â€œThen everyone started pretending to talk into their watches, saying things like â€˜come in KITT, I am a massive tosser, please helpâ€™.â€? By 10am Logan had removed the watch. He explained: â€œIt wasnâ€™t because people were being sarcastic, I just had a hot wrist, everyone gets a hot wrist sometimes. â€œPeople get jealous of early adopters.â€?

Check this : http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/innovations/wp/2014/11/21/the-heartb... .  Apple will be at some point tempted to use that technology for mobile payment and secure the watch again theft (especially the gold one) Tue, 04/28/2015 - 19:38 | 6040770 MaxMax Kids and young adults don't wear watches anymore - they use their phones.  99% of them have a cell phone on them at all times.  I have been considering banning them at work because I see them being used often during the day.  Does Apple really think that kids are going to start wearing watches now?  Do they think the kids even have the money? Tue, 04/28/2015 - 20:20 | 6040905 UselessEater Actually I stopped wearing a watch in '93 after it was stolen and I found that there were so many time pieces around even then that it was unnecessary to replace the watch. Actually I found it disconcerting that I could function through the last year of uni and into work life without ever being late despite lacking a watch. I hate being late, and rarely am. Still do not have a watch. Tue, 04/28/2015 - 20:22 | 6040910 man of Wool No but rich people like like wearing expensive watches especially in Asia/China. (I watch the watch ads on CNN) They now can have an Apple Watch and look cool wealthy/techy with their other rich friends. Everyone else thinks they are douche bags. Tue, 04/28/2015 - 18:06 | 6040412 WhackoWarner I have not worn a watch in my life. NOT EVER.  No need.  I can look at the sun.  And like many other life forms who are tuned in to nature to some degree.....drumroll please.....I always seem to have a pretty good idea of what time it is. WTF do I need a watch for people?  It is not even well designed.  It is not attractive in any way and now proves to be a throw-away, obselete upon purchase piece of garbage. Tue, 04/28/2015 - 18:34 | 6040518 zorba THE GREEK Whacko....I can tell you within 20 minutes what time it is and I too have never worn a watch.  It seems that nowadays if you promote something, you could sell a turd on a stick.  Wake up sheeple, you are being taken. This Apple Watch is for true morons and retarded fucking sheeple. I honestly believe that this is Apple's REVERSE iPOD MOMENT (the iPod being the device/gadget that saved Apple and launched the maker of Chinese/Foxcon assembled gadgets into hyper orbit). IOW, Apple's toast, out of fresh ideas and useful products, and has morphed into a ridiculously overpriced (look at how diluted their shares are due to splits - so, so many) designer of outsource fabricators of less and less desirable trinkets, and will try to leverage media content now to preserve its insane valuation. And just for the "look at all of Apple's cash!" crowd out there, look at all of Apple's debt AND RISK OF CASH VAPORIZATION DUE TO MASSIVE STOCK BUYBACKS WHICH PEG MUCH OF APPLE'S "LIQUIDITY" AT PREVAILING APPLE SHARE PRICES (watch what way the wind blows).
