5 Lowest-Priced Dow Dogs Fetch 50.71% More Return As Of October 16, 2016 | Seeking Alpha Oct. 20, 2015 8:28 PM ET  |  Includes: CAT , CVX , IBM , MCD , MRK , PFE , PG , VZ , WMT , XOM by: Fredrik Arnold Ten top Dow Industrial dividend stocks by yield showed 50.71% greater net gain from $5k invested in the lowest-priced five than from the same investment in all ten. Annual dividends estimated by Yahoo Finance divided by closing stock prices as October 16 determined yields. Analyst net target prices calculated gains one year out. Five lowest-priced Dow stocks, per Yahoo Finance, are PFE, VZ, MRK, WMT, and CAT. Five higher-priced stocks completing the top ten are PG, XOM, CVX, MCD, and IBM. This article refines and distinguishes this earlier report that revealed Dow 30 bargain stocks to buy and hold for one year. See that article also for an explanation of the term "dogs" for stocks reported, based on Michael B. O'Higgins ' book "Beating The Dow" (HarperCollins, 1991), now named Dogs of the Dow . O'Higgins' system works to find bargains in any collection of dividend-paying stocks. Reference to analyst price upside estimates has allowed the dog stock universe to include popular growth equities, when desired. Yield (dividend / price) results from Yahoo Finance for 30 Dow industrial stocks as of market closing prices on October 16 did the ranking. Yahoo Finance provided this explanation for its calculation of dividends per share: "The formula for dividends per share, or DPS, is the annual dividends paid divided by the number of shares outstanding. The denominator of the dividends per share formula generally uses the annual weighted average of outstanding shares. The weighted average is also used with the earnings per share formula. However, there are key differences between these two formulas. The numerator for earnings per share is net income, or earnings. The numerator for the dividends per share formula is dividends. Earnings is effectively a continuous process throughout the year whereas dividends are paid at a given moment. How often a company pays a dividend may warrant consideration for how to calculate the per share portion of the formula when using financial analysis for investments... As with most financial formulas, perspective is important." The ten top Dow dogs by yield from Yahoo Finance after September tallied stocks from six of nine sectors: two technology firms, two basic materials firms, two healthcare concerns, and two services, plus one conglomerate and one consumer goods firm. (Financials and industrial goods failed to make the Yahoo Finance top ten, and the Dow rates utilities in a separate index.) Top Ten Highest Yield Dow Dogs Delivered 13.17% vs. (2) 8.74% Net Gains by All Ten by October 16, 2016 per Yahoo Finance $5000 invested as $1k in each of the five lowest-priced stocks in the top ten Dow dividend kennel by yield were predicted by analyst 1-year targets to deliver 50.71% more net gain than the same amount invested in all ten. The third from the highest-priced Dow dividend dog, Merck & Co. (NYSE: MRK ), was projected to deliver the best net gain of 27.76%. Five lowest-priced Dow dividend dogs for October 16 were: Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE ); Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ ); Merck & Co.; Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE: WMT ); and Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT ), with prices ranging from $34.41 to $69.68. Five higher-priced Dow dividend dogs for October 16 were: Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG ); Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM ); Chevron Corp. (NYSE: CVX ); McDonald's Corp. (NYSE: MCD ); and International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM ), whose prices ranged from $74.90 to $150.39. This distinction between five low-priced dividend dogs and the general field of ten reflects the "basic method" Michael B. O'Higgins employed for beating the Dow. The added scale of projected gains based on analyst targets contributed a unique element of "market sentiment" gauging upside potential. It provided a "here and now" equivalent of waiting a year to find out what might happen in the market. It's also the work analysts got paid big bucks to do. A caution is advised, however, as analysts are historically 20-80% accurate on the direction of change and about 0-20% accurate on the degree of the change.
