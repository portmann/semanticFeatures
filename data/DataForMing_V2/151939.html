Yahoo Is Dead: Buybacks Will Not Save The Giant - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha Yahoo was a great company 20 years ago, but now the business model is dead. Declining revenue, EBIT and net profit are the main factors that will soon destroy the value of the company. However, a lucky deal from the sale of Alibaba and recent buybacks made the stock price grow. Last week (on the 7th of August) Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) announced their quarterly report. After this event the share price of Yahoo fell about 2% to $35.82 per share. Still, Yahoo remains vastly overvalued. During last five years there was no evidence of any significant and positive change in the business strategy of this company. If we look at the dynamics of the revenue and gross profit, we would see that both of these items fall slowly each year. So does the operating income which is going to reach a zero level. However, there is an important feature the investor could look at reading annual reports from the company. This feature is actually a good cash flow from sales of assets. Getting closer, we could see that there was a 92% to a revenue level profit in 2012 and a 223% to a revenue level profit in 2014 from the sale of Alibaba shares. Actually, this lucky deal made the net income of the company boost nearly 5 times in 2014 and the stock repurchase after that made the stock price of the company rise more than 30%. But after that the stock price fell down. And now the price is even lower than the levels of a buyback. The reason for such a decline is evident as was said before - the company's business model is unprofitable. If we subtract the gains from selling activities we would see a huge decline in net income level of the company. And moreover - this decline is not temporary or extraordinary, it is permanent. (But to be frank the main reason for such a decline in Diagram 1 are $4 bln paid as tax due to sale of the Alibaba stake. However, corrected for tax the net profit is near 0 levels, so it does not make a difference.) Despite of the attractive current P/E ratio of about 5.26, there is no evidence that the company will remain a great investment. That's why my assumptions for a DCF model are: CAGR revenue is -1.89%, so in average it will remain the same; Operating profit (EBIT) margin average level is about 10.78%. But the downside tendency will make it 1% less each year after 2015, so in 2019 it will be nearly at a 7% level (frankly speaking, this level is too positive for Yahoo, and the quarterly reports show that, but I would make this assumption to average possible fluctuations in the future); Average effective tax rate is about 32.26% but note that the company at the end of 2014 had more than $17 bln. in deferred income tax, and that would result in a higher tax rate in the future. So, my projection is a statutory rate of 35%. Capital expenditure level is 11.29% lower each year - my projection that the tendency would not change. D&A level to capex is historically about 13.18%, so my projection will remain the same; Non-cash net working capital level, excluding the effect of the Alibaba sale, remains about 4.50% to revenue, so this level will be in the future. Note: Non-cash NWC excludes cash and short-term investments as they do not take part in the company's business activities. In 2014 I had to subtract $3 bln in cash to make the NWC change figures more realistic (= net cash from selling Alibaba); WACC calculation: Market value of debt was estimated as $2.72 bln. For Market Value of Equity I used the market cap figure ($34.12 bln.). Cost of debt was calculated using 2014 Interest Expenses divided by the market value of debt. The tax rate was set at a 35% level (despite the historical 30% level), so the after-tax cost of debt was set at a 1.65% level. Cost of Equity was calculated using the CAPM model (8.25%) with the following parameters: risk-free rate at a 2.2% level (10 year Treasuries YTM), beta at a 1.56 level, Market return of 6.08% (from Yahoo Finance). Using these parameters I figured the WACC as 7.77%. After calculating the figures for 2015-2019, I discovered that the company costs are nearly nothing, and this is not going to produce the appropriate cash flow. So I set the terminal value level at the projected tangible book value of the company that includes future net income proceeds (there are no dividends and there are no plans to pay them). The results of my model are presented in Table 1. You can maintain that discounted FCFFs are so low that we could use only TV for valuation and would not get roughly mistaken. In fact, I will subscribe to your opinion, because this company is really worth only its tangible asset value and nothing more. According to my DCF model the fair price of Yahoo is about $22.84 per share. This is 37% lower than the current level, so I make a strong SELL opinion on this stock. However, consider that the company holds more than $35 bln. in long-term investments (more than 70% of all the assets), so potential gains from these investments can make good cash that historically would result in the series of buybacks. As I see it, this is the only business strategy of this company, so look to buy when buybacks are going to be announced. Sell remains the long-term strategy. P.S. The fact that I used some of the Yahoo services in my research should not be used as an argument against my model.
