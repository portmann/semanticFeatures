Bernstein: Frontier revenues turning the corner - Frontier Communications Corporation (NASDAQ:FTR) | Seeking Alpha Dec  8 2015, 16:46 ET | About: Frontier Communications Co... (FTR) | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Frontier Communications (NASDAQ: FTR ) is headed for a revenue turning point, Bernstein argues. The firm sees Frontier's wireline unit acquisitions from Verizon providing the initial impetus. But after that, growth in broadband demand should supply revenue growth from 2018 forward. It says that revenue outlook isn't completely reflected in the stock's price. Shares closed today down 2.2% to $4.95, and shares are down 25.8% YTD.
