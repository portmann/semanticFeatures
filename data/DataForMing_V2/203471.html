Will We See The Apple Electric Vehicle On September 9? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Much has been written about the Apple EV here on Seeking Alpha and elsewhere. Now perhaps we have an unveiling date. Apple has poached employees from Tesla and seems to have assembled a formidable team. Much work has gone on at San Francisco's Bill Graham convention center and Apple has acknowledged they are having an event there next week. This Seeking Alpha cub reporter was recently in San Francisco. I photographed some of the busy preparations at the Convention Center, and prepared a scoop of an article suggesting Apple (first among several choices) as the force behind this upcoming event. SA editors turned that article down. Then they came out with their own news story with Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) acknowledgment. Here's the little article that tipped me off . Or I could have just asked a Square employee relation who walks by the place every day. Entire lanes of traffic have been blocked off by massive generators and air conditioners as these Seeking Alpha exclusive photos illustrate: Photo credit: Electric Phred via iPad Air, Polk Street side of arena Photo credit: Electric Phred via iPad Air, Larkin Street side of arena Lots of SFPD and rent a cops are posted at every entrance and at the air conditioners in the first picture. None of them have much to say. One mumbled, "They had to take a lot of stuff out and put a lot of stuff in." Most would only confirm that it was a private event and they had a permit through September 13th. Two guys guarding a stack of chairs in front of the adjacent City Hall said work had been going on for weeks. A camera crew filming something entirely different on the steps of City Hall said they'd run a piece yesterday supposing this was another Apple event. Knowing that the camera man knows all and wished he could tell all, Electric Phred quizzed him and got this response, "A friend who works for Local 616, Stagehands, has been working on it for weeks but has no idea what its for." (Boy must he have job satisfaction.) What sort of unveiling needs a 7000 seat venue, weeks of work, and likely millions of dollars? This wouldn't seem to me to be just the unveiling of the iPhone 6s or the iPad Pro (which one rumor has sporting an Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) Processor). I am betting we may see the Apple electric vehicle. Since the rental on the venue seems to stretch past September 9, perhaps it will turn into a mini Apple trade show and fans will be able to oogle and touch various types of unobtanium like the car, the iPhone 6s, the iPad Pro. Perhaps we'll see a Mac book, which some think may be equipped with the new 3DXPoint memory developed by Intel and Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU ). Certainly there is now a precedent of having unveiled the iWatch which was then first delivered weeks later. Mark Hibben wrote this recent piece here on SA, " Has Apple Found The Holy Grail Of Electric Vehicles? " in which he details the possible involvement of a British fuel cell company. Apple Is Working On Secret "Titan" Van-Like EV With Ex-Tesla Engineers Here is an article of February of this year proclaiming, " With 200-strong team, Apple "Titan" EV to be ready by 2020 " Apple is definitely working hard on an electric vehicle, as the many articles attest. They've now confirmed that they are behind the weeks of work and millions of dollars being spent at the Bill Graham Convention Center. Its fun and rewarding to be able to supplement the story with first hand accounts, interview snippets, and photos. I think the only product which deserves this level of effort is Apple's electric vehicle. What do you think we'll see? We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
