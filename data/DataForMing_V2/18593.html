What's the Deal with Amazon's New Dash Buttons? OK, so I was shown something new from Amazon today that I’m not too sure about. I’m literally on the fence about it. It combines convenience with the fast shipping of Amazon. Â Now, these new “things” from Amazon are new and by invitation only. They are also just for Amazon Prime members at this time. Â So, what do you think about these new things? Â Oh, they are called Amazon Dash Buttons and here is what they do. Amazon has been working hard over the years to make it super easy to shop on their site and get you products you need when you need them. They introduced Amazon Pantry to help you get the necessities your house needs when you need them. Â Over the past year, they have been working hard to perfect their new technology called Amazon Dash. Now, the original purpose was to allow you to scan a barcode and get it ordered on Amazon with ease. I don’t see they still offer the original Dash, but they have now come out with Dash Buttons. Dash Buttons are super simple buttons that are attached to a single product. Amazon has introduced 18 large brands at first. So, in essence, you put a Dash button in your laundry room and when you’re out of Tide, you can just press the button and it’s ordered. Easy as that. Â This is all about convenience, which we have all seen people will pay more for. This is like a Staples 'easy button' for buying stuff from Amazon. Click To Tweet As of right now, there are 254 products you can order with a Dash button. The thing is, you have to choose with product from a specific brand you want. Let’s say you like the 18-pack of Cottonelle toilet paper. If you set that product up for your Dash button, then it will order the 18-pack each time. You can’t get the 12-pack unless you change it. This process seems to be quite simple actually. You have to download the Amazon app to your smartphone. Then you can connect your Dash button to your Wifi. This allows you to choose which product you want to connect to that specific Dash button. When you’re ready to re-order, you just press the button once. It then automatically orders the product for you and you’re notified on your smartphone. If you need to cancel the order due to a miss press, you can easily do so on your phone. When I first heard about it, I worried about someone like me with a toddler. What if someone just presses the hell out of the button. Will I get 20 packs of toilet paper sent to my house? Â The answer it no. Amazon only ships out after the first button press. You can press the button all you want, but it won’t ship again until after your first order is delivered. This can still be dangerous if you don’t put the buttons out of reach of those who don’t control the finances. At least the put in some functionality around the button press ordering system and that you can easily cancel any order. Anyone who reads this blog knows I’m a fan of Amazon. I shop there regularly and I’m an Amazon Prime member. Heck, I just used it on Sunday to get a present for my nephew that I needed quickly. Gotta love that two-day shipping. Â Either way, I’m still on the fence about this new product from Amazon. I know why they created it. They want people to mindlessly shop at their store without thinking about it. This is like a Staples “easy button” for buying stuff from Amazon. The big difference is this button actually does something. If you’re interested in trying this out and are a Prime member , then you can get some free right now. It appears Amazon will only provide three per household right now, but they are free. Â It’s by invitation only, so head on over and try it out if you like to press buttons and like to buy stuff from Amazon! I'm a business owner, blogger, father, and husband. I used credit cards too much and found myself in over $50,000 in debt. I paid it off, started this blog, and my financial life has changed. I now talk about fighting debt and growing wealth here. I run a Wordpress management company , along with another blog. It is Empowered Shopper , which helps people get information about products they want to buy. What an interesting concept.  I have been in awe of the innovation and new ideas that Amazon has come up with over the years.  While I might not necessarily use this, I’m impressed with the ingenuity.
