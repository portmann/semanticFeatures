Apple: The Little iPhone That Could - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple's much rumored 4-inch diagonal iPhone is expected to be unveiled at a special event on Monday. The new iPhone will probably feature upgraded internals, such as the camera and processor from the latest generation iPhone 6s. The new iPhone will provide an affordable, entry-level alternative to the iPhone 6s and the iPhone 7 to come in September. At a special event set for Monday, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is expected to introduce a smaller iPhone SE with a 4-inch diagonal screen. Rumors vary as to the specific specs for the new phone, but there is a broad agreement it is intended to be a more affordable iPhone that will replace the aging iPhone 5s. If this expectation proves accurate, the little iPhone will mark a dramatic shift in Apple's product strategy. For the first time ever, Apple will have designed an all-new iPhone that is deliberately not the best it can make, but rather a lower-cost alternative to its best. Alert readers, recollecting the iPhone 5c, may take issue with the last sentence above. I would contend the iPhone 5c was not really an all-new phone, but merely the internals of the iPhone 5 repackaged with a less expensive plastic case. The 5c was a halfhearted attempt at an affordable iPhone that didn't do particularly well in the marketplace. Thankfully, since I last wrote about the rumored 4-inch iPhone last December, rumors have shifted away from it being a similar "6c." Rumor mills such as AppleInsider and MacRumors now agree the new phone will have a metal case, even if it's not clear what the case will look like. Most concept drawings show the case as a sort of melding of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 5s, as shown above. Most of the rumors have also converged to the SE having most of the features of the 6s: the Apple A9 SOC, the 12 Mpixel camera with 4K video capability, NFC and Touch ID for Apple Pay. Lacking only 3D Touch, the little iPhone is expected to be as powerful as the 6s. This may be at odds with the expectation the phone will be priced similarly to the current iPhone 5s, which sells for $499 contract-free. If Apple really is positioning the SE as the 5s replacement, there may need to be some compromises: use of the A8 SOC rather than the A9, an 8 Mpixel camera rather than 12 Mpixel. Even with the more premium baseline, the SE fits in with a Good, Better, Best product strategy once the iPhone 7/7 Plus is introduced in September. The iPhone 6/6 Plus will be retired, leaving the 6s/6s Plus to fill the Better slot. Apple needed something to fill the Good slot. Why not the iPhone 6? I think because Apple realized that there was a market for the smaller 4-inch diagonal iPhone that it couldn't fill with the 5s. Also, there wouldn't be enough cost savings with the iPhone 6, so there would be little spread in prices among the three generations. Most importantly, Apple is moving away from using previous generations of iPhones to fill the Good and Better slots. Most consumer product companies pursue a Good, Better, Best strategy, notably in the automotive industry. In cars, Good is entry-level and sub-compact. Good naturally tends to be smaller in order to save materials costs as well as some manufacturing cost. Especially in automobiles, the Good and Better slots are filled with specifically designed models, rather than previous model generations. This logic applies to the SE as well. The 4-inch screen from the 5s would be by far the least expensive screen since it benefits from being both smaller and the most mature from a manufacturing learning curve standpoint. A smaller screen also means a smaller battery and less powerful graphics requirement. Here, the A9 graphics is a total overkill for the SE, so we may see some modification of the GPU in the A9 for the SE, or use of a previous gen SOC. Automobile makers don't put their most powerful V8 engines in subcompacts. Designing an iPhone specifically to be low cost represents a huge break with the tradition laid down during the Jobs era of building the "best iPhone." The oft repeated mantra "we only want to build the best iPhone" always struck me as peculiarly inconsistent. Apple didn't shrink from offering its other products at a variety of price points and in a variety of form factors. One could see the Good, Better, Best strategy repeated in Macs and iPod, and even in iPad. The need to diversify the iPhone line has been a fundamental tenet of mine since 2013 . This is driven by competitive pressure from the variety of Android devices. And the mantra, as noble as it may sound, has always been somewhat disingenuous, as if Apple isn't a corporation with an obligation to its shareholders to be profitable. As recently as Apple's latest earnings report in January, the management claimed during the conference call that "Apple doesn't design to a price point" (to paraphrase). With the arrival of the SE, or whatever it will be called, investors are about to see that's no longer true. In fact, the statement couldn't have been true at the time it was made since the SE was already in the works. The statement represents a certain inertia in the thinking of Apple's management, even as that thinking continues to evolve. Whatever the SE turns out to be, it clearly represents a design to some form of price expectation, if not a specific price point. And that's a good thing. It means that Apple isn't retiring from the field of battle in the smart phone wars. Apple isn't resigning itself to niche status, as it had to do with personal computers. Lately, analysts have been warming up to the SE, with Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital predicting it could sell 15 million per year . Even Morgan Stanley's Katy Huberty now believes that the worst is over for "supply chain revisions" and is projecting 56.5 million iPhone sales for the March quarter. Some of those sales undoubtedly will come from the launch of the SE. Depending on how Apple prices the SE, it could do much better than 15 million per year in sales. I think it can.
