ETF Hub Oct 20 2015, 04:06 ET | About: Apple Inc. (AAPL) | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor Speaking at global technology conference WSJDLive, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) CEO Tim Cook finally gave some statistics surrounding the company's steaming music service, stating it had 15M users, including 6.5M paying subscribers. "I'm really happy about it, and I think the runway here is really good," Cook said, describing it as a successful debut. Other announcements: Apple plans to have 40 stores in China by the middle of 2016 and expects to start shipping the new Apple TV next week. Cook also spoke unusually frankly about the automobile industry, but declined to comment on the company's auto ambitions. 3,5 month and 6,5 Mio. paying subscribers. 11 Mio. users after 1st month. Conversion rate above 50%. That is truly phenomenal. That number can only be seen as a disappointment. I'm one of the (few) paying users myself (primarily because of the attractive price of the family subscription).  Apple Music has several good qualities, but a significant negative is the cluttered and complicated user interface. When I have time to navigate the app, I'm impressed by the vast catalogue of music. However, the user interface is primarily geared towards consumption of the curated playlists (which are great), whereas the navigation for us who know exactly what music we want to listen to - it takes time and it's not intuitive to find previous search results, unless you create a playlist of your searches. I totally expect Apple to address the complaints about the UI and release an upgraded version. The question is how long time it will take. Relax. They are aware of these issues themselves. This is Version 1, and it's their first dip of toe in the waters of music streaming. They're still learning their users, behaviours, likes and dislikes, and thinking on what values to add to make the experience simpler and better. They will update it soon enough to de-clutter the UI, bit by bit. Version 2 will then be a stronger product for it. 6.5m paying--after roll out 5 months ago--not brilliant. I went back to spotify-- they just offer things in play lists I wouldn't find normally. Apple Music was good at showing the latest chart offerings but thats not what I wanted. Having been long Apple before and making a fair amount of money are we beginning to see the end of growth and ideas that a) just work and b) give the customer something great that they didn't know they wanted? 6.5m paying is a pretty solid number. It's already reached to 1/3 the size of Spotify (20m paying as of June 2015). Here's hoping updates to the UI can keep it growing. thats >500m$ per year revenue rate. It took more than 4 years for Spotify for similar subs. I think ecosystem will make adaption rate faster, interesting to see when 20m subs will be reached Spotify has 20m paid subscribers after 4+ years. Apple Music already generates >$700m annual sales. I am annoyed by the constant bearish tone on this board regarding Apple.
