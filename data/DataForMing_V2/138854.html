The Dow Effect Has Made Apple Ridiculously Cheap - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple is down 6% since entering the Dow Jones Average in March. By any measure, Apple is priced very low relative to other Dow stocks. Since Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) entered the Dow Jones Industrial Average (NYSEARCA: DIA ) in March, it has gone nowhere fast. The shares are actually down 6%. The moves have been more ragged, but do mirror those of the average. Its latest move down, which began July 20, has taken it from $130/share to below $118, and could be signaling a tough day for the broader market. With a market cap of near $700 billion, Apple is by far the biggest and most heavily-traded member of the index. Since the index is price-weighted, Apple's entry into it was likely delayed by its June 2014 stock split, which reduced price volatility. That move did nothing to hurt it, but the Dow move did. Any wonder companies like Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ) aren't anxious to split-and-join? At its present level, AAPL sports a Price/Earnings multiple below that of Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ), which is near 15, but above that of IBM (NYSE: IBM ), which is at 10. In past years, rumors that it might be on the verge of becoming its own mobile virtual network operator, or MVNO , and launch a new Apple TV with an app store might be sending the stock rocketing upward, but now it's being met by yawns. Instead investors seem obsessed with the problems of Apple Music, which is not material to results, and the slow roll-out of the Apple Watch, which is also not material to results. Instead of looking at its huge cash pile - bigger than the GDP of Greece - they're looking at the company's growing indebtedness, now nearly 20% of assets - and forgetting that it only exists to distribute the cash. (It's also a tiny fraction of that cash). Apple is now cheap by any measure. A $260 market cap for a company that delivered $70 billion in operating cash flow last quarter? A P/E of under 14 for a company that easily delivers a yield of 1.76%? A P/E less than half that of Google? It might make sense if growth were less than Google's, but Google's revenues are up just 11% year over year while Apple's are up 32%. Profit margins are comparable at about 25% for each, and Google's operating cash flow of $15 billion last quarter was dwarfed by Apple's $70 billion. Yet, Google's market cap of $439 billion is now nearly two-thirds of Apple's $696 billion. The only explanation I can come up with is that Apple is now being valued as a Dow stock, like Wal-Mart, Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM ), and McDonald's (NYSE: MCD ), rather than like the growth stock is remains. At some point later this year, Apple will explode like a coiled spring, Dow effect be damned. You'll want to have money there to enjoy the ride.
