Apple Is Wrong To Limit Free Item Giveaways On Games - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple reprimanded Mixi, developer of Japan’s top-grossing Monster Strike iPhone game. Apple did not like Mixi’s strong habit of giving away free premium game items. Monster Strike’s average daily sales in Japan are $4.2 million. Apple gets a 30% cut of that easy money from iOS players. Some readers here at Seeking Alpha still doubt my contention that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) really cares a lot about the easy money it derives from App Store sales. However, the recent act of Apple banning Japan's top-grossing game Monster Strike last week should be enough evidence that Apple hates it when its App Store commissions are not maximized due to game publishers' habit of giving away free premium in-game items. Monster Strike generates average daily sales of $4.2 million in Japan. Apple already gets a 30% cut from iOS gamers but it still punished Monster Strike's developer/publisher Mixi. The iPhone company was not happy with Mixi's repeated use of serial code promotional giveaways that let players get free premium in-game items/currencies. Dr. Serkan Toto explained this sin of Mixi as detrimental because Apple doesn't get its usual 30% cut from serial codes-generated premium items. Dr. Toto also said the practice of serial code promotions is popular among Japanese publishers of freemium mobile games. Apple previously banned another top-grossing Japanese game publisher, Colopl , last June due to the same serial codes promotion habit. The surging mobile gamer population of Japan has helped Mixi and ColoPL join the ranks of the world's top-earning game publishers. Monster Strike and GungHo's Puzzle & Dragons were responsible for 70-80% of the estimated $5.8 billion that Japanese mobile gamers spent last year. The Q2 report of SensorTower reveals that Monster Strike's amazing $4.2 million/day in performance in Japan made Mixi the No.4 top-earning games publisher. Apple owns the iOS platform and its strong-arm chastisement of Mixi might also extend to other game publishers. Apple likely banned (temporarily, it's now up again in Japan App Store) Monster Strike to send a strong message to publishers that lost revenue from serial codes-related giveaways is now strongly discouraged on the iOS platform. The daily commission of Apple from Monster Strike players in Japan could have been higher had Mixi not aggressively distributed premium items via serials codes promotions. American publishers like Zynga (NASDAQ: ZNGA ) and Glu Mobile (NASDAQ: GLUU ) might also get the same disciplinary action from Apple soon. Glu often entices me to watch a video ad to install another mobile game to get free serial codes, which gives me free Gold in Terminator Genisys: Revolution . Gold in Terminator Genisys allows players to buy more powerful premium weapons. In-game Gold costs real dollars but we all know not all players can afford to spend $19.99 to buy a decent beginner rifle. We also know that the nature of freemium games forces publishers to offer something free to attract non-paying players. Non-paying players can remain loyal and increase the population of daily active players when they get something for their loyalty and dedication. Apple apparently now wants game publishers to reduce (or even abandon?) their use of serial codes-related marketing tactics. Giving away free premium items has contributed to the rise of TapJoy and other offer wall firms . TapJoy claimed last year that serial codes giveaways doesn't hurt revenue for games publishers. Apple's recent action against Mixi says otherwise. There's billions of dollars at stake. Apple made $1.7 billion in App Store commission last July. A majority of that is from games-related purchases. The disciplinary action of Mixi in Japan could be a precursor to what Apple will also implement among iPhone gamers in the United States and China. The U.S. and China are the biggest markets for iPhones. These two countries are now also the biggest sources for mobile games revenue. China's mobile games revenue is estimated to reach $5.5 billion this year and $11.1 billion by 2019. Apple, as the biggest beneficiary of the mobile gaming industry, therefore has every motivation to ensure that direct in-app purchases are not affected by too many third-party promotional serial codes giveaways. AAPL is a Buy. Tim Cook is ruthless when it comes to protecting/increasing Apple's share of the mobile games industry pie. Apple is obviously not happy that serial codes promotional giveaways are now obligatory to attract more active non-paying players. However, I firmly believe that attracting non-paying players for freemium games is important because they provide competition against the 1% or 2% of players who regularly buy Gold in Terminator Genisys or Monster Strike. Apple should still tolerate a disciplined use of reward-based serial codes promotions from game publishers. The risk I see is that, while publishers have no choice but to bow down to Apple's preference for reduced promotional serial codes giveaways, current top-grossing games might find it harder to attract and retain non-paying players. The $4.2 million/day feat of Monster Strike will not last long if a majority of non-paying players abandon it. Freemium games get pretty boring fast if they became limited-population, pay-to-win propositions. Retaining regular/repeat in-app purchases from the top 1% paying players require that Mixi or Glu spoon-feed the 99% non-paying player population. The macho factor inherent in fighting/action games like Monster Strike thrives on egos of the moneyed people. Premium item purchases helps the rich players beat poor non-paying players. There is little point in buying in-app premium weapons if Apple discourages non-paying players from being competitive through laying long hours (and hundreds of watching app install ads) just to get rewards-based serial codes promotions. Instead of aggressively clamping down on free premium items giveaways, I would prefer Apple find a way it can get a cut from the fees earned by offer wall firms like TapJoy, inMobi , and Fyber. There are now 320 million users of Fyber (formerly known as SponsorPay). Some of those people are likely using iPhones or iPads. Apple could also try strong-arming TapJoy and Flyber to use more of the iAD platform for their rewards-based serial codes-laden app install promotions. Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL, ZNGA.
