Here’s how to make sure you don’t wind up locked into paying for a service you don’t want. There are two ways to do this, through iTunes or through the Apple Music app. If you don’t turn off auto-renew in time, you’ll either be charged the monthly individual rate of $9.99 or the family plan price of $14.99. â€¢ Click on your account in the upper right hand of iTunes â€” this should have your name or Apple ID on it. â€¢ Navigate to â€œAccount Infoâ€? and then settings, and click on â€œManageâ€? beside subscriptions. â€¢ Click â€œEditâ€? which is located next to â€œApple Music Membershipâ€? â€” if you have multiple subscriptions. â€¢ Click on your account â€” again, the silhouette icon, on the upper left hand of the Apple Music app. â€¢ Next go to â€œView Apple ID,â€? then scroll down and hit â€œManageâ€? under the Subscriptions section.
