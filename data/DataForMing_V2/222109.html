Risks To The Micron Long Thesis - Micron Technology Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) | Seeking Alpha David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital has reduced his fund's position in Micron over the last quarter. While the company's shareholders are likely to be rewarded handsomely over the long term, there are many risks that could derail the Micron long thesis. Micron's 3D NAND and XPoint have the potential to significantly impact the profitability of the company over the long term. It is far from impossible that unexpected engineering challenges will emerge. The NVM oligopoly is not as strong as the DRAM oligopoly. Micron and Intel are likely to force the competition to spend and innovate to catch up. For those that have read my prior articles on Seeking Alpha , it is pretty obvious that I am very bullish on the prospects of Micron (NASDAQ: MU ). The company finds itself in the midst of a great transformation in the memory industry. While we are still years away, the beginning of the era of a gigantic shift from HDDs to SSDs is within view. In NAND, Micron finds itself partnered with Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ), the one constant near the top of the list of major semiconductor companies over the decades. Micron has the potential to become the lowest-cost producer of 3D NAND in 2016, and is also set to release the most important advancement in the memory industry (3D XPoint) in a quarter of a century sometime next year as well. In DRAM, Micron (via Inotera) is quickly closing its cost disadvantage through a node shrink to 20 nm. While the short term is going to be bumpy, the long term growth of the industry is virtually assured. This is all wonderful for Micron investors, and I have mentioned these points many times throughout most of my articles on Seeking Alpha. I now want to point out the risks to the long thesis that I firmly believe in. David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital is one of the largest hedge fund shareholders of Micron. Einhorn is, with good reason, one of the most respected hedge fund managers around. In his third quarter 2015 letter to investors , he writes about Micron and says: The problem is that structural industry improvement doesn't make DRAM less cyclical. The large capital requirements force participants to make large investments in anticipation of future demand. If the industry overestimates demand, it still makes sense to operate at full capacity and oversupply ensues. This year, demand came up short, DRAM prices collapsed, and despite our concerns about PC demand, we missed the turn of the cycle. Regarding Micron's NAND business, he writes: Micron Technology's other business is flash memory or NAND. We anticipated a significant recovery in NAND this year that failed to materialize. He also identifies two other risks: a possible Chinese expansion into DRAM and Micron's more aggressive capital expenditures plan. As a result of these risks, Einhorn has reduced Greenlight's stake in Micron. The highly cyclical nature of the memory industry is unlikely to change in this decade, the next decade or ever. The unfortunate nature of the industry is that demand can move up and down tremendously over a very short period of time, while supply is close to flat when looking at most small windows of time. It takes billions (and now more like tens of billions) to build a fab, and a few years before a fab can begin rolling out wafers of memory products. Going forward, the members of the memory oligopoly (and Micron (with Intel) in particular) should see higher highs and less frightening lows in the cycle. I believe we are seeing that already with the current cycle. The first potentially catastrophic risk that Einhorn mentions in his letter involves the desire of China to manufacture DRAM. With just three major manufacturers in Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ), SK Hynix ( OTC:HXSCF ) and Micron, the oligopoly seems to be strong and getting stronger, with Micron potentially eyeing an acquisition of Nanya, Inotera and/or Winbond. Last year, it was reported that China is looking to invest up to 1 trillion renminbi (~$157 billion) to develop the semiconductor industry within its borders. Rumors heated up earlier this year that Tsinghua Unigroup was looking to acquire Micron for $23 billion. In one of my prior articles, " Micron and China's Semiconductor Dreams ," I discussed how difficult it would be for a Chinese company (or any company for that matter) without the aid of Micron, SK Hynix or Samsung to break into the DRAM industry. At a Raymond James conference in September, Micron's Kipp Bedard estimated it would likely cost a Chinese firm $40-50 billion and 5-10 years to develop a viable DRAM manufacturing business (if it were to develop the business completely organically). That would seem to be a very large deterrent, but it appears Tsinghua is making moves that make me wonder if that large financial and technological moat is enough to prevent a new entrant into the industry. Tsinghua Unigroup has hired Charles Kau, the president of Nanya Technology and the chairman of Inotera Memories. Micron is the largest shareholder of Inotera and buys all of its DRAM output. Kau is leaving his position at Nanya, and it is unclear whether he will retain his role at Inotera. While it seems that Tsinghua Unigroup is positioning itself for an attempt to acquire Micron (or at least form a joint venture with the Idaho-based company in China), there remains the possibility that Tsinghua is unable to strike a deal with Micron and decides to attempt to go it alone in building a successful DRAM fab. There is no other company in the world (without the backing of a government with deep pockets) that could realistically even attempt this Herculean challenge. A new entrant into the industry who may not be as focused on the bottom line as its Korean and American counterparts could put the industry back into a dark age reminiscent of 2008. Ultimately, I believe China will either give up its DRAM dreams or find a way to partner with Micron (or another DRAM manufacturer). Tsinghua Unigroup recently purchased a stake in Powertech, a major Taiwanese chip packaging and testing company. Powertech and Micron have a joint venture in China to package the bulk of Micron's memory chips going forward. Tsinghua (and its affiliates) has now struck deals with some of Micron's key partners (Intel and Powertech), and has also poached an executive at a Micron affiliate (Inotera). There is risk of a potential catastrophe in the making, but I see very low odds of Tsinghua making a huge investment in building an independent DRAM fab that has what I view as a very high probability of failure. While I feel like I am not worthy of questioning a king (Einhorn), I believe the odds of a Chinese DRAM manufacturer emerging out of nowhere is low enough to not meaningfully impact an investment thesis. Micron has increased its guidance on capital expenditure for FY2016. In a perfect oligopoly, this should not occur often. One would expect all members of the oligopoly to keep capital expenditures low and supply tight (especially given how high the barriers to entry are into NAND and DRAM). However, in NVM (non-volatile memory), the thesis of a strong memory oligopoly being in place is starting to break down. We are headed down a path where four NAND manufacturers are going to use four different 3D NAND architectures. A next-generation NVM (3D XPoint) has been developed by Micron and Intel, which appears to have the potential to create enormous change in the memory hierarchy of electronic devices. We are likely going to see four (or more) next-generation NVM architectures emerge as a response to Micron and Intel's 3D XPoint. The NVM portion of the memory industry appears to be competitive going forward. The NVM universe needs to be viewed from a vantage point that includes not only Samsung, SK Hynix, SanDisk (NASDAQ: SNDK ) (with Toshiba) and Micron (with Intel), but also Western Digital (NASDAQ: WDC ), Seagate (NASDAQ: STX ) and potentially others. While I view Micron (with Intel) as the company in the lead by a wide margin with its 3D NAND and 3D XPoint, it certainly is not a foregone conclusion that the very talented and accomplished engineering teams of Samsung and SanDisk (and others) will not be able to create comparable, or perhaps even better, products in the near future. The first risk to Micron's goals in NAND is whether its 3D NAND solution really is as cost-disruptive as Intel and Micron believe it is. On paper, it appears the 384 Gb 32 layer TLC NAND die on 175 mm^2 will be the densest 3D NAND product in the market in 2016. There are no guarantees that Micron will be able to get this product out in high volume next year. The company expects half of its NAND bits to come from 3D NAND by the end of 2016, but unexpected technological problems could emerge. It is now approaching 18 months since Samsung has released V-NAND (Samsung's version of 3D NAND), and the Korean semiconductor giant is still having significant challenges with the "leakiness" of its product and low yields. Could Micron and Intel potentially face engineering challenges in 3D NAND that lead to multi-quarter or even multi-year delays or unexpected additional costs? It is something that seems to never get discussed, but it is not outside of the realm of possibility. The shift from planar NAND to 3D NAND is dramatic as the difficult problems of manufacturing shift away from the traditional lithography challenges of node shrinks to the new challenges of more complex etching and deposition steps. Another potential pitfall of Micron's strategy in NAND is its choice of using a floating gate 3D NAND design (along with Intel). There are numerous advantages of a charge trap flash design over a floating gate design. The incumbent leaders of NAND design (SanDisk and Samsung) have certainly not lost their minds by choosing 3D NAND architectures with this feature. The answer to the question - Which firms created the best 3D NAND designs (and which ones are headed towards catastrophe)? - will probably not be known for years. It is a long-term and significant risk that should not be ignored. Micron and Intel have seemed to jump to a huge lead in next-generation NVM by revealing 3D XPoint this summer. The planning for the initial presentation by Intel's Rob Crooke and Micron's Mark Durcan seemed extremely rushed. Unsurprisingly, the presentation did not "wow" the general public in a similar manner to the way Steve Jobs impressed Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) fanboys with new iPhones and iPads. The performance characteristics of XPoint are fantastic. However, the cost of manufacturing this new memory and its ability to scale (quickly and cost efficiently) are topics management of Intel and Micron do not seem to want to discuss with the investment community right now. Because of the poorly planned presentation, I initially believed that this technology was far from ready, and might be something that starts to hit the market in 2017 or 2018 (or possibly even later). Intel has announced XPoint-based SSDs (and other XPoint products) will be available in 2016. While I certainly expect this new memory to fundamentally change the memory hierarchy of electronics and make huge waves in the technology world, there are reasons to believe my expectations of Micron and Intel being 2-3 years ahead of the competition could end up being way off base. SanDisk and HP (NYSE: HPQ ) are working on a next-generation NVM with similar performance characteristics that HP representatives have stated should hit the market perhaps 2-4 years after XPoint. However, developing new memory technologies is extremely challenging. There's a very good reason why no new ground-breaking memory technology has emerged in a quarter century before XPoint (and that is assuming XPoint is, in fact, as wonderful as I think). There's a possibility that HP and SanDisk could catch up quicker than I expect, and there's certainly a possibility that they fall so far behind that their joint development effort has to get scrapped altogether. Samsung and SK Hynix have been mum about developments they are making in response to 3D XPoint. Could the Korean semiconductor companies be far behind Micron and Intel right now and not wanting to alert the industry? Could the Korean giants surprise the world much like Micron and Intel did by revealing their awesome new memory (PCM, ReRAM, MRAM, transistor-less memory or some new fancy memory) within the next year? Are they working on secretive projects to develop an NVM that is quicker than DRAM, has nearly infinite endurance and somehow is also cheaper than DRAM (and XPoint)? Just as quickly as Micron longs declared victory upon the announcement of XPoint, Samsung (or Hynix or SanDisk) could re-steal the show again with no advanced notice. DRAM spot prices have begun falling steadily over the last few weeks. The rate of decline in spot prices is not as dramatic as it was in June and July, but the declines are enough to worry Micron longs about the possibility of further compression in DRAM gross margins. In my view, DRAM gross margins will not serve as a major risk to Micron longs in the long term, as the industry should eventually start to shift DRAM capacity elsewhere if the trajectory of DRAM prices stays as is. 3D NAND, XPoint and logic chips for the IoT should present opportunities to reduce DRAM wafer capacity in the not-too-distant future (for Samsung, Micron and SK Hynix). Despite all of these risks and many others that I did not mention above (including a slowdown in China's economy, a slowdown in the worldwide economy, Intel possibly competing hard against Micron in NAND/XPoint and acting less like a partner of Micron, prices of HDDs falling faster than that of SSDs per GB over an extended period of time, etc.), I firmly believe Micron is very undervalued at these price levels. I have been increasing my long position by buying more MU shares over the last several weeks. While there are real risks that could damage Micron's value in the future, the risk-reward ratio is very favorable for longs right now. While I believe Einhorn is a fantastic fund manager, I think he is making a mistake by reducing his holdings in Micron now. I find myself on the opposite side of Einhorn's recent MU trades. It is going to be a very bumpy (and hopefully profitable) ride with the stock over the next 18 months. Over this time, we will likely get a clear picture of the potential (or perhaps failures) of 3D NAND and XPoint. I remain very optimistic about Micron's prospects.
