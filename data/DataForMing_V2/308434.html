Universal launches demand-based pricing for Harry Potter attraction - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Feb  2 2016, 12:37 ET | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor After Walt Disney ( DIS -1.7%) floated trial balloons last year over demand-based pricing at its theme parks, Universal Studios ( CMCSA -1.6%) is becoming the first to fully launch the model , anticipating heavy crowds at the April 7 opening of its attraction "The Wizarding World of Harry Potter." In Universal's case, visitors buying at the gate will still pay $95. But booking online for low-demand days can save park visitors up to $20. Discounts will still be smaller on weekends and peak demand periods. The move can help Universal manage demand and comes with perks for customers: Those who book online can enter the Harry Potter area an hour before the rest of the park opens. Harry Potter attractions have been a big revenue driver for Comcast, and no doubt Disney is watching closely: It may want to better manage demand for its "Star Wars" land when it opens in Anaheim.
