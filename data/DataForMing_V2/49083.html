Humes - Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Damon, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a solid start to the year with healthy local currency revenue growth across all regions and lines of business. The demand environment was relatively solid globally with Asia-Pacific and Latin America clear standouts as strong revenues were complemented by solid increases in profitability. As anticipated, our sales mix in Europe improved over the 2014 fourth quarter with lower sales into consumer markets leading to modest year-over-year improvement in the profitability of our European Technology Solutions business. In mobility, we had good growth across all regions while cloud and supply chain solutions continue to grow at robust rates. We delivered revenue and earnings per share towards the midpoint of our guidance ranges, despite lower profit contribution in North America and while expanding our capabilities and geographic reach in mobility, cloud and supply chain. Turning to some details on our Q1 results, revenue for the first quarter was $10.6 billion, up $260 million, or 2.5% in U.S. dollars versus last year, and up more than 10% in local currency. Our recent acquisitions of Armada, ANOVO and the distribution businesses in Chile and Peru contributed a total of 1% of our growth, with ANOVO and the Latin America acquisitions adding less than one month of sales. First quarter technology and other solutions revenue was $8.9 billion, up 6% in local currency and down 1% in U.S. dollars. Mobility revenue was $1.7 billion, increasing year-over-year by nearly 40% in local currency and 27% in U.S. dollars. Gross margin of 5.8% was up sequentially from the 2014 fourth quarter by 24 basis points, but down 8 basis points year-over-year. Q1 gross margin benefited from improvements in Asia-Pacific and Latin America as well as from recent acquisitions. These improvements were offset by lower North American contribution primarily due to lower mobility gross margins related to higher Verizon channel sales than last year. North America mobility was also impacted by lower-than-anticipated resale pricing of returned handsets in the secondary market. We are addressing the areas of the mobility business that are currently not performing as expected and our negotiating terms that meet our profitability requirements, or we will exit those portions of the business. Non-GAAP operating expense of 4.62% was favorable by 8 basis points versus last year and would have been a favorable by 18 basis points excluding acquisitions. Savings from our organizational effectiveness program and solid operating expense leverage in Asia-Pacific and Latin America more than offset strategic investments. Non-GAAP operating income of $125 million was up 2%, resulting in operating margin of 1.18% flat with last year. On a currency-neutral basis, non-GAAP operating income was up 9%. Non-GAAP interest and other expense of $29 million was up $3 million over the 2014 first quarter due primarily to our December bond offering and higher working capital requirements. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.43 was flat versus last year and up 9% on a currency-neutral basis as the translation of foreign currencies had a $0.04 impact when compared to last year. Now looking at some regional details, supported by growth across all business lines, North America revenue of $4.4 billion was up 7% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currency. North America technology and other solutions revenues was up low single-digits in local currency. Sales of datacenter and networking infrastructure solutions were strong. Specialty categories of training services and physical security solutions sales each delivered solid double-digit growth. Mobility revenue increased more than 100%, driven by Verizon channel sales. Our North America cloud business was up nearly 100% and supply chain solutions continue to deliver solid growth. Non-GAAP operating margin was 1.59%, down 29 basis points compared to last year primarily related to lower mobility gross margin as well as a modest decline in contribution from our core business. We also continued strategic investment in cloud and supply chain solutions. Europe revenue of $3.1 billion was down 11% year-over-year in U.S. dollars, but up 7% in local currency. Technology and other solutions sales were up low single-digits in local currency, benefiting in part from strong networking sales. We continue to see relative strength in SMB broadly. Double-digit growth in France and Sweden was driven in part by robust smartphone sales. Germany was relatively flat as the consumer business slowed as expected following strong Q4 sales. Non-GAAP operating margin was 45 basis points, down 20 basis points versus last year. As anticipated, our technology solutions sales mix improved over Q4 with lower consumer sales leading to modest growth in technology solutions margins over last year. The region also realized incremental savings from our organizational effectiveness program. However, these improvements were reduced by strategic investments in mobility, cloud and supply chain solutions. Asia-Pacific performed well again this quarter with revenue of $2.6 billion, increasing 11% in U.S. dollars and 15% in local currency. Non-GAAP operating margin was up 49 basis points to 140 basis points with the majority of countries delivering improvements over last year. Australia and India each continued strong double-digit revenue growth, driven by robust PC sales, good uptake of advanced solutions and strong demand for smartphones. System sales continue to be soft in China, but the country delivered mid-single-digit growth benefiting from strength in consumer focused product lines. Our Middle East business delivered robust growth in revenues and margins supported by strong advanced solution sales and benefiting from our recent acquisition of Armada in Turkey. In Latin America, solid growth in all countries delivered revenue of $580 million, an increase of 18% in U.S. dollars and 30% in local currency. Non-GAAP operating margin increased 11 basis points to 2.07%. Mexico saw strength broadly, including in SMB, consumer and commercial projects with solid advanced solutions sales, particularly in networking. Miami export also delivered double-digit growth, driven in part by strong smartphone sales and PC sales. Brazil continued to deliver solid growth with strength in advanced solutions and data capture point of sale. Peru, Chile and Colombia each had robust growth across most lines of business, benefiting from recent acquisitions and building momentum in mobility and supply chain solutions. Turning to other highlights in the quarter, HP represented 15% and Apple 12% of total sales in Q1. CapEx for the quarter was $22 million; depreciation was $21 million; and amortization expense was $16 million. Non-GAAP return on invested capital was 10%, more than 200 basis points above our weighted average cost of capital. At quarter-end, our cash balance was $510 million and net debt totaled $900 million. Cash generated from operations for the quarter was $60 million, a significant improvement to cash usage of nearly $430 million in last year's first quarter. Working capital days were 31, up six days sequentially. As anticipated, we had strong release of capital in Q1, more than $400 million from our robust Q4 mobility sales, which was largely offset by a seasonal increase in working capital days due primarily to an eight-day increase in DIO. The temporary increase in DIO is due to the strong sequential decline in revenues from Q4, coupled with inventory levels increasing modestly due to slower consumer sales in Europe and larger inventory buy-in deals in North America that will flow through in Q2. Working capital management is always a focus, and this year we're implementing additional programs to improve each country, including working capital day targets tied to incentive plans. We are confident that working capital days will come down as they historically do in the second quarter and third quarter. In that way, we will generate $350 million to $500 million in cash flow from operations for the 2015 year, which excludes our expectations for approximately $100 million in reorganization costs relating to actions Alain will cover shortly. Alain Monié - Chief Executive Officer & Director Thank you, Bill. Our Q1 financial results were in line with our expectations. We delivered solid local currency growth globally and a 9% improvement in non-GAAP operating income on a currency-neutral basis. Our end markets continue to grow, supported by macro trends, including the rising ubiquity of mobile and connected devices. Consumption of technology and services in the cloud and increasing requirements from our SMB customers to deploy more complex IT solutions on premise and off-premise. We're clearly well-positioned at the center of the mobility ecosystem and talk often about our rapidly growing cloud footprint, but we're also making strong progress in our advanced solutions. Over the past several years, we have added capabilities and expertise to move up the IT value stack, and Ingram has rapidly become recognized as a provider of choice for data center, networking infrastructure, and security solutions in our important SMB market. Our leading position as a cloud master service provider positions us even better in this space, as the hybrid environment with embedded cloud and mobile connectivity is fast becoming the norm. Advanced solutions are one example of the broad portfolio of interconnected businesses and operations we manage across the globe. We're carefully balancing opportunities to accelerate growth with our profitability objectives. We're also continuing to make share gains in important end-markets such as with larger enterprise and government customers, while gaining momentum in cloud and supply chain solutions. The steps we're taking now are important elements of leveraging our customer, vendor and global infrastructure basis to achieve our 2016 profitability targets. We're making good progress in a number of areas, while at the same time, managing through the normal dynamics of our business where change is constant and technologies more rapidly mature with the profitability opportunities stabilizing at a competitive level. We're continuously developing new and emerging vendors, while also increasing the contribution from our advanced solutions and associated services businesses. Remaining agile, innovative and managing through change means quickly taking the decisions required, both to invest in new technologies and adapt to the cost of serving maturing businesses. To ensure we maintain our path towards our 2016 financial targets, we're taking global cost actions, which are expected to result in savings of approximately $100 million in 2016. Currently, we expect to begin to realize initial savings in Q3, exiting the quarter at $20 million to $25 million annual run rate. We anticipate entering 2016 with most of the cost actions having taken place. Additionally, with now good progress on our strategic initiatives, we plan to resume share repurchases opportunistically under our existing $400 million authorization, which has approximately $124 million in remaining available capacity. For Q2 this year, we currently expect revenue in U.S. dollars to be relatively flat versus last year and up high-single-digits in local currency. Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $0.50 to $0.58, which reflects the negative impact related to currency movement of $0.04 when compared to last year. As shown by the combination of our strategic investments, our cost actions and our capital allocation plans, we remain clearly committed to taking the necessary decisions to deliver on both our near-term and our long-term financial objectives. Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Matt Sheerin from Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Matt J. Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Yes. Thanks and good afternoon, everyone. First question, Alain, regarding your commentary on the cost-cutting program helping you to get to the fiscal 2016 target of – I think the midpoint was around $3.50 in earnings. Is that correct? Is that basically the number that you're targeting still and you need an additional $100 million in cost to get to that number? Alain Monié - Chief Executive Officer & Director Let me start, I'll pass it on to Bill as well to complete. But the answer to that is yes. What we're doing first, though, is you need to take into account foreign exchange adjustments, right. So if you look at our prior targets and you assume the foreign exchange is going to stay where it is today, that would bring the range down to midpoint of around, what, $3.35, something like that. It's about $0.20 of negative impact. But to stay within that range, and we are fully committed to stay within our original range, those cost actions will help us get there in a way that we see much better way to that path. So, yes, we're maintaining our targets after you do the adjustments for foreign exchange. Matt J. Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. But it seems like the $100 million will get you, I mean, it should, in theory, get you more than $0.20, which would mean that there may be some margin or profitability issues in the rest of your business. And you brought up, which is, I guess, the follow-on question, but somewhat related to the fact that your mobility business now looks less profitable than it had been and it looks like that may have something to do with this big revenue swing you had related to the Verizon business. So I guess, the question is: are there other parts of the business where you're pruning costs, which will help you get to that number in addition to FX? Alain Monié - Chief Executive Officer & Director There are, in effect, as I mentioned, on the Verizon business, some portions of that business that are not delivering on our expectations. And as I mentioned, we are working on fixing those and we will fix it, or we will exit the portions that we don't like. So that's a piece of the impact that we're compensating. And as far as where the costs are going to be taken, they're going to be taken across the organization. It's not a surgical cut here or there. It's an approach that allows us to reduce the cost across the company in different geographies and different lines of businesses. Bill, you want to add anything? William D. Humes - Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Matt, this is Bill. I mean, overall, this – the overall cost actions aren't really to address the mobility side of the business in North America. It's more broader. It's really to address the overall trajectory towards our target. So we felt it was necessary at this time to be proactive and make these changes. So that's why, you've seen us communicate now. Matt J. Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Okay. And then, regarding the mobility business, it just seems surprising that you're seeing some profitability issues when you're really only maybe quarter two or quarter three into some of these ramps that you would have thought that there would have been some contracts or parameters where you would have had a good sense of where the margins shake out, or maybe there is a mix issue or some other issues that you're dealing with? William D. Humes - Chief Financial Officer Yeah, Matt. It's Bill again. Overall, it's really related to the new Verizon business that ultimately we grew from very small levels last year to very large levels. The profitability issues that we realized in Q1 really result from, I'd say, some growing pains and us really anticipating and being able to appropriately estimate the level of returns that come through and then ultimately the sales price that we realize on those returns from the big box retailers and some of the indirect channels. So they were substantially more than we expected and then the pricing was less. So we're having to adjust that model. We're addressing those issues as we speak. It worked well, the business for us very well in 2014 as we ran into the huge ramp in fourth quarter with seasonal business. Much more sales returns came back and the pricing as well. So we do believe that Q2 will be a fix-it quarter for the North America mobility business. And then it should look either much better or we'll exit that business and deliver the cash flows from exiting the business after that in Q3 and Q4. Matt J. Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Alexander from Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. Brian G. Alexander - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Okay. Maybe following up on North America. So growth slowed dramatically, margins were disappointing. And it sounds like all of this was driven by mobility, and it seems like within mobility, almost all of it was driven by the Verizon contract, which I know was an exciting opportunity a few quarters ago. So I just want to make sure that that's correct. And if so, how much money did you lose at the operating line on the Verizon contract? Because overall revenue was up in North America year-over-year, your operating income dollars were down and I'm just trying to quantify how much was isolated to Verizon. And were there any other issues in mobility when you talk about resale pricing being lower than you expected? Is that also Verizon? Or is that separate from Verizon? William D. Humes - Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Hi, Brian, it's Bill. I'd say the lion's share of the impacts on the operating margin do come from the Verizon business. The rest of mobility in North America actually did fairly well. The services business was doing strong and very, very profitable and some of the other business within the mobility side, the accessories was very strong as well. So Verizon business did lose a little bit of money relative to actually making money in the prior-year quarter. So the swing was bigger than you would have anticipated. And the resale prices is on the Verizon business on returns, so, yes, that's right. We also had – to address your second part of or one of your parts of your question – we did have incremental investments in the cloud and supply chain services business, so roughly about 10 basis points. Brian G. Alexander - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. William D. Humes - Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I mean, right now we're continuing to be investment mode probably for the next couple of quarters. Towards the end of the year, we should be starting to see some returns, mild returns at least in those investment areas and then increased returns in 2016 as an important element of our overall long-term profitability targets. Brian G. Alexander - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Okay. And then I want to ask a question about cash flow and the balance sheet. I think this was supposed to be a strong cash flow quarter due to the Verizon balance sheet issues you had in Q4 with the big receivable, I think you had previously said $600 million. So it's still not clear to me why working capital management wasn't a little bit better this quarter. I think you talked about inventory was up, but if you can just kind of help us understand why such a big increase in cash conversion cycle? And the second part, and I apologize for the multi-part questions, Bill. $350 million to $500 million in operating cash flow this year if you got there would basically put you at breakeven on a two-year basis given the operating cash flow losses or declines or negative number you had a year ago. So you previously talked about a three-year goal of exceeding $1 billion in operating cash flow and if you're just going to be breakeven on a two-year basis, it doesn't seem plausible that you can get there. William D. Humes - Chief Financial Officer Right. Let me address your first one. On the cash flows, yeah, I mean, one way or another, we are still pleased with the fact we're able to turn this year's quarter into a positive cash flow relative to last year's significant negative. But I think the dynamics in the business if you look at the last few years Q4 to Q1, we've generally had an uptick in working capital today then we definitely experienced that from Q4 to Q1 as well. And that really offset the cash flow generated from, one, the release of the balance sheet in revenues from mobility business as well as the rest of the TS business that you'd normally see in Q1. That was offset by an increase in the investment in days in working capital. Largely looking at inventory, I'd say a couple of different aspects. In Europe, as we have talked about last year when we did the Q4 earnings call, and then as expected, the consumer business was pretty slow with the big box retailers in Europe. So, therefore, we didn't sell much of the inventory through in Q1. Expect that to flow through in Q2, though. And then on the North America side, overall, we did have some additional kind of discount buy-ins in inventory both on the technology solutions as well as the mobility side. Again, expect those to sell through with nice margins into Q2. And then overall, we didn't adjust our inventory levels commensurate with the sales decrease from Q4 to Q1. So that is an element that has offset our cash flow, so we will work just as normally we see Q2 to Q3, we get the working capital days down, we'll flush out more cash flow in that period of time going through Q2 and Q3. Now overall to your second question on operating cash flows through the three-year period, we had a pretty significant dialog about the cash flows last year, negative cash flows, which was largely the investment into the Verizon business. As we fix that business or exit it, that should deliver excess cash flows as well overall. But we always said we would reinvest into the business and we did. We are generating cash flow besides that, but the – so the overall, the $1 billion target, we talked about this. You can – it's the way you kind of just, I'd say, to present it, but we did reinvest it in the business and we should be positive this year as well as driving it for next year. And if we can actually see on the operating cash flow a positive $1 billion, that would be easy to say, but we're going to have investments in business off and on large ones. So I can't necessarily say we're on that target the way you'd want to see it, but we are happy with ultimately the end goal that we see in 2016. Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC Hi, guys. Yeah. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I have a couple, if I could. The first is on the cost savings plan. I guess, by my calculations, it's somewhere in the $0.45 range incremental, kind of plus or minus. And, Alain, you talked about – sorry, Bill. I think it was Bill talked about sort of, kind of, using it to offset about $0.20 of incremental FX headwind. But I guess, in the context of your 2016 guidance, it would still give you a lot of room for upside into the 2016 guidance. So can you just talk about, at this point, do you plan on passing the lion's share of that cost savings through to the bottom line? And then if you don't, what might you do with it? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks. William D. Humes - Chief Financial Officer Yeah, Ananda, it's Bill again. Overall, I mean, I think the cost actions are not being put in place because of the foreign currency translation adjustment. That's just sort of mathematics, unfortunately. But that's just the kind of a baseline to start with. The cost reduction actions we're doing we do believe are appropriate to do. You are looking at our overall base business and the trajectories are going along as we want, so they're moving forward. But – and they're heading in the right direction, but maybe not at the speed that we originally anticipated. So doing these cost actions really are to help get that in the right trajectory and if we actually increase the speed of our improvements in the business, then, yeah, that's kind of the positive side of it. But this is really us managing the business, making appropriate adjustments and being committed to hitting our targets. Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC And how much of the readjustment is sort of taking place in the context of the Verizon business relative to some of the other areas? Because it seems like most of the other areas are either stable aside from maybe retail in Europe the last couple of quarters or actually growing kind of commensurate with the plan. So could you, Bill, maybe talk about which areas are driving, sort of, the desire to reduce the cost base right now? And I have one more question. William D. Humes - Chief Financial Officer Sure. Yeah, I mean, overall I would say, the general cost reductions aren't really being addressed to hit the Verizon side of the business, the mobility business focused around Verizon. It's more just overall we have some pretty – we've got pretty good improvements that we are driving for overall in our targets. And like I said, some of the business is not moving as fast as we would like it to because there's things that come up, commoditization on margins or other things and some of our investments are being – are actually working out well, but it's hard for them to show a huge, I'd say, increase in the results relative to the core. It's hard because they're dwarfed in size and performance. So really it's to adjust the overall areas of the business that we need further improvement in and to get to those increased goals in 2016. Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC Okay. Great. And then just the last one for me is, can you put some context around the reintroduction of the buyback? I think in the press release – I mean, in your comments, you talked about, sort of, opportunistically buying back stock. Can you talk about, sort of, what would constitute, sort of, opportunism? And you have – I think it's $124 million left on the buyback. There's room to do, sort of, much more than that if you would choose to. So, sort of, what might – what does opportunistic mean? And then, sort of, strategically, what might move you to, sort of, do something greater than opportunistic down the road? Thanks. Alain Monié - Chief Executive Officer & Director Ananda, this is Alain. We've spent the last three years in really focusing on growing the business, doing M&A, growing organically. What we're saying today is that we're no longer restricting ourselves to doing only that. And so we want to reopen the possibility then to look at share repurchases. So anytime you're below book value, it starts to be interesting and we're going to be considering that as another avenue to create value. We do have $125 million – $124 million remaining of the prior existing authorization. But as we – as the needs will come, we've had that discussion with the board already several times. And we will go back to the board and get more as we needed. Obviously, there is no limitation on the possibility to talk about that with the board right now. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva from Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. James D. Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker) Thanks, guys. And could you just clarify a little bit on the mobility challenges? Is it one issue that's all related? Or is it actually two issues? Meaning, from the press announcement the way it's laid out, there was, kind of a comma and talked about the Verizon business and then also it talks about the secondary or the reused reselling market. Are those the same or are they actually two different challenges? Then I'll have a follow-up. William D. Humes - Chief Financial Officer Yeah. They're one and the same, essentially. So within the Verizon business and returns ultimately that we then sell into the secondary market. Alain Monié - Chief Executive Officer & Director Yeah. If you – and Q4 is a specific quarter for that because of the very high rate of buy from the end customers from retail. And that's why the rest of the year we didn't see that. The returns – buyers' remorse, all those kind of returns that the retail observe and see were within the parameters of what we had modeled in our original business case. What happened is that in Q4, there was a lot more purchasing there. So that increases the number of returns. The second piece is the value of those returns once you dispose of them after having done some refurbishing and all that hasn't been at the level that we needed given the volumes. So it is the same issue, but it does have two parts to it. James D. Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker) Great. And then my follow-up question on that note is, you mentioned the cost savings program was not specific to the mobility segment, if I heard correctly, it was more overall. So if we were to focus on the most incremental area for improvement, which sounds like right now is really the mobility side. What specific actions are you taking then for that? Because I think it'd be incorrect to assume $100 million savings comes from mobility. So is it your pricing was off? Is it the market value of when you repurchase the phones and resold them changed faster than what you thought? Or is it your cost model that's misaligned? And what specific actions are you taking to remedy that? Thank you. William D. Humes - Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Are you talking specifically, Jim, on the mobility business, Verizon business or overall with our cost actions? James D. Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker) The mobility Verizon business because from the costs so far, it sounds like that's the biggest opportunity for incremental change or a delta? William D. Humes - Chief Financial Officer Right. But those – yeah, those are separate from the cost actions. So we're addressing that business working with all parties of those transactions. So the customers, the vendor and Verizon itself to establish terms that are, I'd say, adequate for us to make decent or acceptable return on capital and operating margins, addressing the areas that, I'd say, we have a little bit of leakage in the operating margin as well as on the capital side. So we're addressing it on both sides and certain of the business, if it doesn't take on the sense of the negotiations, we will walk from it. ... opportunity lower (36:18) cost savings. That's a very different program. James D. Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker) Okay. And those terms that you're kind of relooking terms, that you're renegotiating or relooking, are those designed on like a model basis, or annual basis, or quarterly basis, or what about the concern about we may hit this speed bump again in three quarters or four quarters down the road? Because it seems like maybe it's actually just a costing or is it a term sheet agreement challenge that we should think about for the mobility business? William D. Humes - Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I mean, I'd say, this is going to be more about the terms that we're willing to do business with in this channel at. So whether it's pricing, working capital, or level of returns, there are different factors for different areas of the business. So we're addressing all of them and there's certain limits or either maxes or thresholds that we're willing to do and we'll drive to those thresholds to get to the level of profitability and then some so – in returns on capital. So it's kind of hard just to give you exact specifics, but we're addressing all facets of the business. Good afternoon. This is Garrett Hinds in for Lou. Just had a quick question on the Latin America acquisition that closed March 18. How did that increase your inventory? William D. Humes - Chief Financial Officer This is Bill again, Garrett. Overall, I'd say, we closed it right at, I'd say, right in March. So we only had three days' worth of – or three weeks or so of overall business, but yet we acquired the whole balance sheet. So your comment is pretty – is right. It had an impact overall on Latin America, I think, by about six days, but it had very small amount of impact on the worldwide because just the very size of Latin America. And then how should we think about the cadence of working capital reversing throughout the rest of the year, second quarter and third quarter like you highlighted specifically, and then maybe fourth quarter also? William D. Humes - Chief Financial Officer Right. I mean, as you see generally on the fourth quarters, we drive pretty good working capital days and have over the last several years. We are driving for improvement from Q1 to Q2. It's hard to tell exactly how much, but we're driving for it. We have incentive plans at the country level and onwards tied to working capital days and achievement thereof for the year. So we have the right focus, and we're addressing it fairly hard. Some of it will naturally come out, such as the inventory levels that we've talked about on – in Europe and North America where we'll have some sell-throughs of the additional buys that we had. And Europe's consumer market is expected to open up a little bit more in Q2. So that should work its way out. It's hard to give you a quantity in the sense of days, but improvement is what we're shooting for. Appreciate that. Just one last one. The inventory buildup, was it more focused toward desktop PC, datacenter? Could you give us any color there, especially, with what we're hearing about weakness in semiconductors and desktop PC and then also some strength in the datacenter? William D. Humes - Chief Financial Officer Yeah, I'd say, all things consumer-oriented in Europe, I would say, but we're not going to give specifics on the type of inventory, but generally everything that addresses consumer. Osten H. Bernardez - Cross Research LLC Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Just real quick on the Verizon business. How would exiting certain contracts and certain areas of that business look for you? And could you remind me, I believe you're using your own refurbishing solutions or facilities, I should say. And just wanted to know if you can walk me through how we should be thinking about the timing of the potentially exiting certain aspects of that as well? William D. Humes - Chief Financial Officer Yeah. I would say, overall, we're addressing the business and the profitability and returns in Q2. So we believe that through most of Q2, we'll have either acceptance of the different terms and working out the fixes of the business or start exiting after that, at least portions of the business. If you remember, for cash flow-wise, you can think about it. Last year at year end, we had about a little over $600 million of capital tied up into the business at year end. At Q1, we probably had a little bit less than half of that amount. So as you would expect, we had the normal release of the balance from the capital. But if we had all the business, likely it would go up substantially again. But if we fix some of the working capital day terms, it wouldn't grow as much at least per working capital days. So – but I would expect the changes to happen in Q3 and Q4 for the most part. Osten H. Bernardez - Cross Research LLC Okay. That's helpful. And then when considering the global actions and the $100 million in targeted savings, is there a way we should be thinking about that from a regional perspective? Alain Monié - Chief Executive Officer & Director This is Alain. It's going to be across. It's really more related to the way we are structured and we manage the business today more than the regional drive. So it will impact all regions. Clearly, Europe and corporate are big chunks of that, but I would say, it's going to impact all regions to the benefit of each and every region. Osten H. Bernardez - Cross Research LLC And then lastly for me, can you highlight whether, I guess, what you're seeing just in general with respect to the PC demand in the first quarter and what you're seeing for the rest of the year? Anything different from what you've commented on, say, 90 days ago, not too long ago? Paul Read - President & Chief Operating Officer Yeah, Osten. This is Paul. The PC demand has certainly slowed in this first quarter, which isn't surprising after a very strong December quarter. In fact, it was so strong at the retail level it never sold through as much as that it was hoped. And so we have a glut of inventory in the channel in the quarter. And that's why, particularly in Europe for us, we had a buildup of inventory there in the March quarter. We don't see that changing too much. I think the channels will unload and there'll be modest sales. We had a probably, plus or minus, kind of, a 2% growth in PCs during the quarter. Our last question comes from the line of Keith Housum from Northcoast Research. Please proceed with your question. Keith M. Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC Thanks, guys. I appreciate the opportunity. Looking at your restructuring you guys did last year in Europe, I think you guys were hoping for $80 million or $100 million in savings. As you look back at what you guys had in the first quarter, are you satisfied that you were able to capture that $20 million to $25 million in the quarter? William D. Humes - Chief Financial Officer Yeah. Hi. This is Bill, Keith. Overall, the organizational effectiveness program we completed last year was not solely addressed to Europe. It was a global cost. There was significant amounts of cost that came out of Europe overall, but it was more of a global program. We are – so we are confident that we initiated the changes and realized the cost. We did invest in different areas of the business, plus there was a little bit of gross margin compression as we talked about in Q4 for Europe, at least. And the good part about it, as we saw in Q1, the technology solutions business-wise stabilized a little bit with less consumer demand. So overall, they actually had a year-over-year improvement in operating margins. So anyway, the overall new cost reductions here will be much more – it will be broad-based as well, but Europe will have its fair share. Keith M. Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC Okay. And then the cost savings you expect to obtain in FY 2016; is that going to come from additional head count reductions? Or is that from more efficiencies gained through recent technology? Or any color you can provide on that? Alain Monié - Chief Executive Officer & Director It's going to touch different areas. Obviously, when you look at head count, those come pretty quickly into it. The $100 million we have is a mix of systems improvements, but also, you're correct, head count reductions. So if you put it in perspective, though, you look at our total spend, we're talking about anywhere between 4% and 5% of our total OpEx, so you can pretty quickly realize that it's not a major effort. It is an important effort; don't get me wrong. But it is, in our opinion, pretty achievable with the degree of certainty that we require in those cases.
