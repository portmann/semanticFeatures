What To Consider Before Selling Apple - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha AAPL's stock is 12% off its 52 week high. Some investors fear that iPhone 6s and 6s Plus unit sales will represent a decline to its predecessor. AAPL is priced as a company with flat to slightly negative growth, has a decent yield and huge buybacks. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has the largest market capitalization in the world, is the most held stock among investment funds, and is also a top portfolio component for most retail investors. However, with the stock now trading about 12% off its 52-week high, and an iPhone 6 & 6 Plus refresh on tap, there's a lot of investors considering whether or not to take profits after a 47% return since 2014. But before you do, there are a couple things you should first consider. The iPhone 6, 6 Plus has been an absolute blessing for Apple investors. Apple seemingly put its best foot forward, launching several new services like Apple Music, Apple Pay, and of course larger screens to go along with a faster processor and a more user friendly operating system. These things have allowed Apple to enjoy its fastest unit growth since the 4s, which will easily top 35% unit growth. While Apple had two units with the current iPhone model((s)), the growth is still very impressive. Nonetheless, investors are now quite concerned that unit growth with its upcoming iPhone 6s and 6s Plus will result in Apple's first ever decline in year-over-year units sold. The reason is a very tough comparable period, and with analysts currently expecting revenue growth of just 5% next year, investors can conclude that it is going to be a tough call as to whether or not Apple sees unit growth with the upcoming iPhone refresh. Perhaps the most alarming metric for me comes from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who has been called by many publications the best Apple analyst on the street. Kuo is currently guiding for 6s and 6s Plus unit sales at a midpoint of 70 million for the first quarter, Apple's launch quarter. While we are still months from the launch and don't yet know what new services and features that will be associated with the 6s and 6s Plus iPhones, Kuo's current estimate would represent a significant slowdown from the 74.5 million units that Apple sold in the same period last year. With that said, it is no surprise that some are giving major thought to whether or not take profits and walk away from Apple. Here's the thing: Apple is not priced as a company with 35% to 40% unit growth, but like a company whose primary product has zero growth. Therefore, it shouldn't be too much of a surprise if the upcoming iPhone models have zero unit growth, or a slight decline. Apple trades at just 8.3 times next year's earnings minus cash. Furthermore, it has a dividend yield of 1.8% and the largest stock repurchase plan in the world, one that has led to very large stock gains in recent years. Therefore, before you sell Apple, in fear of a decline in iPhone unit sales, first consider expectations, the company's valuation, and what Apple gives shareholders to own its stock (ie buybacks and dividends). Given these things, how much downside really exists in Apple? My belief is that there isn't much, not compared to the upside. Beyond that, there is another big question that must be answered, and that relates to capital gains tax as an additional incentive to hold on to your Apple shares. More than likely, Apple has been a key component of your portfolio, and you have held it longer than a year. I say "more than likely" due to Apple's market capitalization and the fact that it is commonly the largest and most held stock of investment funds. My assertion is that Apple is also a top holding for retail investors. So, let's say you invested $20,000 in Apple back in January of 2014. Your return on stock gains alone would be nearly $30,000. If we incorporate dividends, the return would be even greater, but for the sake of argument and capital gains we'll look solely at the stock return. That $10,000 you earned from the investment is your capital gain, and unless you are in the 10% to 15% tax bracket for income then you will have to pay a tax on those gains, if you sell. For most, that capital gains tax is 15%, and if you fall into the highest 39.6% tax bracket then your tax would be a whopping 20%. In other words, $1,500 to $2,000 of your gains belong to Uncle Sam, and I think that is an important observation to consider before divesting your Apple investment. Specifically, let's just assume "your" $30,000 stake in Apple translates to 257 shares, which is the current stock price of Apple divided by $30,000. After your capital gains tax, you are essentially selling Apple's stock at $108 to $110 per share. In my opinion, that's very cheap, a price that's really selling Apple short. That's why I am holding my Apple shares despite the reality of flat to slightly declining iPhone 6s, 6s Plus unit sales. I think the stock has priced in this outcome, and because of Apple's dividends, buybacks, valuation, and the money I'd have to give back in taxes, it makes the most sense to hold these undervalued shares.
