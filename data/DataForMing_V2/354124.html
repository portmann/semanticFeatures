Fitbit falls on high volume; Argus report likely the cause - Fitbit, Inc. (NYSE:FIT) | Seeking Alpha Mar 30 2016, 17:27 ET | By: Brian Pacampara, CFA , SA News Editor Fitbit (NYSE: FIT ) closed down 4.3% on high volume of 16.5M shares, nearly double its three-month average of 8.9M. While no major news came out today, a Tuesday report from Argus Insights likely had something to do with the drop. Based on an analysis of over 136,000 consumer reviews of wearables, Argus finds that people who own Apple Watches and Fitbits are not pleased with the health and fitness apps tethered to them. Actually it had more to do with bears getting a hold of a Fitbit recognized glitch in the new Blaze. But that report from Argus was insightful. If you look at the dot plot Fitbit was actually rated fairly high comparatively speaking.  All gonna end the same way anyhow. Hmmm. Apple didn't drop based on the Argus report out today. Maybe some people understand that while the Apple Watch can be used as a fitness tracker, it's hardly just a "fitness device". Fitbit when it is all said and done will be like Facebook. Flounder and flap around for a couple of years, then become firmly esconced. Products and investors more than often do not see eye to eye. Fitbit is oversold, there's no if's and but's about that. Today's drop is still an overreaction despite this Argus non-news. However there is some truth to this report. It's not that the Fitbit apps aren't good at what they do, they are the best in fact in terms of pure fitness play. However they need to be great, they need to find whatever is missing in them, that holy grail feature which will make the biggest behavioral impact on users and draw them more frequently into the app. That will ultimately make the product stick. I love this company and their products and do believe that they will maintain their lead in the wearables. They seem to have a better understanding of what features should go on someone's wrist at this point in time, versus Apple who tried to stuff in a whole phone into the Watch. What should I do with my iphone? I'd rather have great products with not so great management then weasel managements with crappy products or business model!
