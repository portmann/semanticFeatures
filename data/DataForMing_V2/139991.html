Wall St. higher as data eases September rate hike worries | Reuters Markets | Wed Aug 5, 2015 11:22am EDT Wall Street was sharply higher on Wednesday, after three straight days of declines, as weak private sector hiring tempered expectations of a September interest rate hike. The ADP National Employment Report showed private employers added 185,000 workers in July, the smallest growth since April and lower than the 215,000 increase forecast by economists surveyed by Reuters. The weaker-than-expected data indicates that the economy lost some momentum at the start of the third quarter and reduces expectations of a strong reading in the government's payrolls report due Friday. "I don't think the Fed is ready to raise rates and is looking for reasons to not raise," Stansberry trading analyst Jeff Clark said. "The data supports the idea that the economy isn't overheating and so there isn't an overwhelmingly compelling reason for the Fed to raise rates in September." In other economic data, trade deficit widened in June as solid domestic demand in the second quarter and a strong dollar sucked in imports of food and automobiles. Some economists have said a bunch of tepid economic reports  - released in the last few days - could prompt the U.S. Federal Reserve to wait until December to increase interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. The Fed has said it needs to see a sustained recovery before it raises rates for the first time in nearly a decade. Stock market investors are keeping a close eye on economic data and the Fed's statements as a rate hike would increase cost of borrowing for companies, leading to lower profits. They got some succor on Wednesday when Fed Governor Jerome Powell told CNBC that the central bank's policymakers had not yet decided whether to raise rates in September.
