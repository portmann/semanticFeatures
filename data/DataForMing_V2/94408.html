ETF Hub Jun 22 2015, 18:56 ET | About: The Boeing Company (BA) | By: Carl Surran , SA News Editor Although the number of new aircraft orders at last week’s Paris Air Show fell Y/Y, Canaccord analysts remain bullish on Boeing (NYSE: BA ) and other aerospace companies, saying the sector is now focused on execution and investor expectations, as well as cash, as the plane makers and parts suppliers enter the "harvest” phase of the current cycle. The show brought no new program announcements from Boeing or Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSF , OTCPK:EADSY ) but the firm says both companies issued strong signals regarding production rate increases on narrow-body jets. Canaccord is confident in upside potential at Rockwell Collins (NYSE: COL ) because of better than industry commercial original equipment exposure and growth and the improving free cash flow profile. The firm says Precision Castparts (NYSE: PCP ) reaffirmed its desire for a merger or acquisition or other vertical integration opportunity in its segment. Spirit Aerosystems (NYSE: SPR ) could provide a surprise to the upside as part of its contract arrangement with Boeing, Canaccord says.
