ETF Hub Dec 31 2015, 18:43 ET | About: The Boeing Company (BA) | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor FedEx has committed to purchase another 16 Boeing 777s (NYSE: BA ) -- at an average unit price of $318.7M, a deal that comes to more than $5B (not counting any discounts for a deal that size), according to FedEx's Stat Book. FedEx already has 27 of the 777s, dating back to its original order in 2006, and the completion of that order will bring it to 31 by 2019, according to FedEx. Fulfillment of the new order will begin in 2020 with an anticipated three planes, and three more to follow in 2021. Earlier this year, FedEx confirmed it agreed to purchase up to 50 additional 767 freighters, to bring that total order to 106 aircraft through fiscal 2023 (about a $9.9B deal). Nice.   I use fed ex and am very glad to see that have continued to buy Boeing and not Airbus.
