GoPro: Is It Finally Time To Buy? Yes - GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) | Seeking Alpha The problem with GPRO is not that growth has stalled but that it was hovering at bubble valuations to begin with. No matter how great a company is, if you overpay, chances are you will lose money . Today however the valuation of the company is well within my buying parameters. As always I advise putting the stock on your radar and buy on technical strength . One of the biggest mistakes investors make time and time again is to overpay for a stock just because it has great growth. As a reminder to long-time readers, paying anything above a price/sales ratio of 5, in most cases, means you are looking for trouble. And that is exactly what has happened with camera maker GoPro (NASDAQ: GPRO ). GoPro was a very high growth company and the market had marked its stock to the sky. Just how high? Well as usual I take the price/sales ratio as a proxy: Let me repeat my theory on how not to lose money folks. NEVER pay more than 5X sales for any stock, unless you have a crystal ball and know that revenue and EPS will be increasing by more than 50% indefinitely. So after running up to almost $100 a share, GPRO landed on planet earth and has fallen more than 80% from its high. The question is, is it now a time to buy? I think so. The first reason is that as the chart above shows, the price/sales ratio of GPRO is 1.5. Long-time readers know this is well within the range of what I would be willing to pay for a stock. GPRO Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts The second reason is that the company is still growing at a very healthy pace. While investors should not expect the type of growth the company exhibited in 2014, nevertheless it's still forecasted to grow around 20% over the next 12 months. According to analyst estimates (data from yahoo.com), GPRO's revenue will be $1.7 billion in 2015 and $1.95 billion in 2016. That's not bad in my book. Earnings however are not expected to grow as much, with analysts forecasting EPS of $1.22 in 2015 and $1.29 for 2016. That means the current trailing P/E is 15 and the forward 12 month P/E of 14.4. While not dirt cheap, not expensive or a bubble either. Also, the balance sheet is in spotless condition. The latest quarterly report shows that GPRO has $1 billion in current assets, with $345 million in total liabilities (not just current) and with no debt. The company also has announced that it intends to repurchase about $300 million worth of its shares. While it has not acted yet, it's a good thing to know. And I think the company might just start buying at these prices. The company's current market cap is about $2.5 billion. While this is not a small amount for most companies, it is for Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). As reported in Barron's (via S.A's blog here ), FBR's Daniel Ives in a note about potential Apple buyout targets notes: Additionally, GoPro's new product cycles could open the door to areas where Apple's competitors are investing heavily (e.g., drones, VR), and Cupertino has been playing catch-up. We also see strategic value in GoPro being integrated with Apple's strong multimedia ecosystem (e.g., iTunes, Apple TV, etc.) I concur folks, I think that GPRO would be an excellent buyout choice for Apple. While I would not buy GPRO speculating on a buyout from Apple, it's a good thing to know that such a wild card exists. And in my opinion, the possibility of such a buyout has pretty good odds. Of all the above reasons, the best reason to put GPRO on your radar screen is that it has corrected by a lot and is not a bubble anymore. As always, since I do not know how low the stock can go, if you are thinking of buying GPRO, I advise buying on technical strength and not right away. I would use any technical indicator you are comfortable on a weekly scale. And when you get a buy signal, buy at will, because this is really a great company.
