Why Intel Could Really Sell 30 Million Smartphone Processors - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha The overheating issue makes the Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 a bad move for Asus Zenfone. The new Lenovo K80 Android phone boasts 4GB of RAM and a quad-core Intel Atom SoC. I argued before that Asus could help Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) sell 30 million smartphone application processors this year. However, my friend Ashraf Eassa said my estimate is more viable in 2016 . Ashraf argued that Asus will allegedly also use Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) and MediaTek processors for lower-cost ZenFone Android smartphones. However, Filipino blogger Yugatech's interview with Asus CEO Jerry Shen revealed that Asus is only "considering" future use of the mid-range Snapdragon 615 SoC for "select" versions of the ZenFone. Qualcomm-powered Zenfones might not even come this year. I think Mr. Shen is probably waiting for Qualcomm to fix the overheating problem of the Snapdragon 615. Samsung and OnePlus rejected the Snapdragon 810 because of the overheating issue. The Snapdragon 615 is the cheaper version of the 810. People who bought smartphones that used the Snapdragon 615 also complained about the very high temperature from their phones. The vehement reactions of readers on GSM Arena confirm my belief that using the octa-core Snapdragon 615 could damage the popular brand of the Asus ZenFone. The ZenFone 5 and ZenFone 4 became very popular in the Philippines because of their unique Intel-powered advantage. Unlike Mediatek or Qualcomm-powered low-cost Android phones, the ZenFone products could be used for long hours of gaming. The problem with the first batch of 64-bit Snapdragon 615 processors that Qualcomm released last year is that it is a miserable overheating experience for HTC Desire 820 users. The "extremely hot, painful" assessment after less than 5 minutes of playing 3D games on HTC Desire 820 also applies to the Micromax Yu Yureka. The Yu Yureka also uses the octa-core Snapdragon 615. Gamers are unlikely to buy a Snapdragon 615-powered ZenFone if it causes a painful experience. Putting octa-core processors inside fanless, zero air-vents smartphones is a disaster for hardcore mobile gamers. The reason why I like gaming on the Intel-powered Asus FonePad 7 and Asus ZenFone 5 Lite is that they never get hot even after 2-hours of playing the console-quality Marvel: Contest of Champions. The FonePad 7 and ZenFone 5 Lite are both powered by dual-core x86 Atom processors. It is why they do not overheat, dual-core does not generate heat as much as octa-core SoCs. I believe that Apple also continues to use dual-core A8 processors because of the same reason. My old iPhone 4 is a gaming machine that can do 3-hour heavy-3D gaming marathon without any overheating fatigue. Graphic designers know that dual-core workstations (that has lots of RAM) are best for long hours of HD video editing. Quad-core and octa-core processor-equipped computers get hot quickly unless they are equipped with liquid-cooling solutions. The same principle applies to smartphones, putting octa-core power in fanless devices is a temperature-raising problem. Sadly, there is no liquid-cooling solution to octa-core mobile processors so Qualcomm is unlikely to solve the overheating issue of the Snapdragon 615. The new quad-core Atom-powered Zenfone 2 offers outstanding gaming performance and there's no complaint of overheating after 10 minutes. Jerry Shen might risk alienating mobile gamers if Asus starts using the Snapdragon 615. My dual-core Intel Atom-equipped Asus Fonepad 7 has gorgeous console-quality graphics and smooth performance even after two hours of playing GPU/CPU-heavy games. I firmly believe that Jerry Shen will continue to favor Atom processors because even older Atom Z2520-powered phablets like the FonePad 7 can play very advanced, console-quality 3D games like Plunder Pirates without overheating. Using octa-core processors is just for show-off benchmark scores that do not really translate to real life usage. Lenovo, the world's top vendor of PCs and third-biggest vendor of smartphones, has also decided to use the Intel Atom for its new quad-core, 4GB RAM-equipped mid-range smartphone, the K80 . The $290 Lenovo K80, which is very similar to the Asus ZenFone 2 in terms of hardware specs, is another testament of Intel's better 64-bit SoC implementation. Lenovo apparently did not ignore the overheating issue of the Snapdragon 615. Even if Asus use Qualcomm SoCs for some of its Zenfone models, I still believe that Lenovo's support is enough to make my 30 million estimate reasonable. Study the chart below, Lenovo is a top-3 vendor of smartphones that has more brand recognition and distribution channels than Asus now has. While Asus only aims to sell 30 million Zenfones this year, Lenovo already proved it can move 100 million or more smartphones every year. The chart below is a simple explanation why I believe Lenovo's support is now a bigger tailwind for Intel's smartphone campaign. Krzanich has the charm to win the support of the leaders of the world's biggest phone vendors. Intel has also proven that its 64-bit Atom processors-equipped smartphones are not prone to overheating issues when people use them for heavy 3D gaming. Asus is therefore likely to continue using Atom processors for its smartphones and tablets. Lenovo and Asus are two very strong OEMs that made Intel the king of x86 PC processors. These two giant allies will also help Intel smite the mighty presence of Qualcomm SoCs in Android devices. Unlike Ashraf's speculation that Rockchip-made 3G-enabled Atom X3 processors will only be accretive in 2016, I firmly believe that Intel is now already working fast (but quietly) to deliver lots of its Cherry Trail Atom SoCs to Chinese OEMs. INTC therefore remains a Buy. Smart buyers (like mobile gamers) will not buy Mediatek or Snapdragon-powered smartphones that uses processors with overheating issues. Word-of-mouth and YouTube complaints over overheating definitely affects the decision of millions of would-be buyers.
