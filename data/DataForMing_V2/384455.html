Verizon: Dump Bid For Yahoo - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha Verizon continues making progress with building new media assets while wasting time on a bid with old media Yahoo. The latest earnings results from Yahoo show a business in secular decline that keeps getting worse. The latest news has Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ ) as the likely top bidder for old media Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) while buying a new media company. After the close Tuesday, Yahoo reported Q1 results that again question why Verizon wants to buy the core business of the company that's in big-time decline. Verizon has traded weak since the signs emerged that the company was likely going to purchase Yahoo and the union went on strike. The latest Yahoo numbers suggest the market is right that the deal is bad for the communications giant. My previous research recommended staying away from the stock with the deal pending. Investors need to only look at one short-term slide from the Yahoo earnings presentation to understand why buying the company at almost any price is a bad move. One though only needs to view the lack of traction in the Mavens (mobile, video, native, social) to understand why the user base at Yahoo isn't worth the money. The Mavens group only generated total revenue growth of 7% on a YoY basis. The mobile section only grew 11% YoY despite Yahoo placing a bigger emphasis on growing mobile. Remember that Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) is on target to grow revenues by over 15% this year, and this includes legacy business lines. The following slide shows the continual leak in net revenues. After reporting a nearly $200 million YoY decline in Q1, Yahoo forecast a further decline to below $850 million for Q2. The company even sees the possibility of revenues dropping to $810 million for an incredible 22% decline from last Q2 levels of $1,043 million. At the same time, Verizon is fooling around with the dying business of Yahoo, the company used a joint venture with Hearst Media to buy Complex Media . The total deal price was listed at up to $300 million and involves a 50% ownership in RatedRed.com and Seriously.TV that combine for 57 million MUVs and now 300 million monthly video views. The deal builds on the recent 24.5% purchase of AwesomenessTV. The senior vice president of consumer product and marketing made the following statement that sums up where Verizon is headed: The decision to acquire Complex is certainly a continuation of our media strategy, which is focused on disruption that is occurring in digital media and content distribution, and involves building a portfolio of the emerging digital brands for the future for the millennial and Gen-Z audience. Or at least with this deal as the Yahoo bid has the company going for content assets last hip with the young crowd about 15 years ago. Verizon could take the $10 billion that the core business of Yahoo might cost to make 40 purchases similar to the one for Complex Media. The key investor takeaway is that the interest in bidding for the declining assets of Yahoo becomes more troubling for Verizon on a daily basis. The Yahoo user base is highly overrated as the company quickly gained access to over 50 million users with a simple purchase of a new media company.
