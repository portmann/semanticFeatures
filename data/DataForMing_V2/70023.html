ETF Hub May 28 2015, 23:21 ET | About: Yahoo Japan Corp. ADR (YAHOY) | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Yahoo Japan ( OTCPK:YAHOY ) is up 8.6% in Tokyo, the biggest single-day jump in two months, as it says it's looking to team with Alibaba Group (NYSE: BABA ) to enter China's e-commerce market . The company -- Japan's third-largest e-tailer -- will help guide Japanese companies to sell products, especially household goods, on Alibaba's Tmall and Tmall Global sites. Japanese goods' increasing popularity in China is providing expansion opportunities, Yahoo Japan (a JV between Softbank ( OTCPK:SFTBY ) and Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO )) noted in a statement. Well considering that Yahoo has a 35% in Yahoo Japan, an increase in sp would be rational.  I would also guess that this will fuel speculation of an Alibaba buyout of Yahoo, whether that be warranted or not.
