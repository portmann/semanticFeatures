Disney: A Pullback Is Coming For This 'Must Own' Company - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Disney is an iconic American company and a must own stock for any long term growth portfolio. Current valuation levels are excessive due to an increased risk in Disney's ability to beat earnings expectations. A pull back in Disney's share price is very likely that will provide a far better entry point for the stock. In previous articles I have argued the Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS ) represents one of the best long term investment opportunities in the S&P 500. In summary, the iconic American company has built an incredibly well integrated media model to monetize superior brands across its Film/Studio, Media Networks, Parks and Resorts, Interactive, and Consumer Product Segments. Under CEO Bob Iger's leadership Disney has honed the model to near predictable perfection and delivered incredibly strong earnings growth over the past three years. (Read my detailed analysis of the company here.) The Disney/Iger model is an earnings juggernaut that is almost certain to outperform earnings growth in the broader market over the next several years. The current share price of Disney (roughly $107 at the time of writing) reflects all of the company's near term growth potential, however, and investors would be wise to remain patient for the inevitable pull back in share price. The catalysts discussed below reference the company's last few quarters of earnings reports. ( Click Here ) 1. ESPN's Growth Rate. Disney's earnings growth has been built on typically stable to modestly growing earnings from ESPN. Yet a pattern has emerged over the last three quarters that should be troubling to investors in the short term. ESPN has become a headwind to earnings growth as the company has been forced to pay rising programming fees, most recently for the newly negotiated NBA contract , and has seemed to reach a near term limit for significant fee revenue growth. Disney's phenomenal growth rates in film and its modestly improving performance in its other Media Networks properties has more than offset the lackluster performance of ESPN, but the size of ESPN and its contribution to earnings means that even a modest acceleration in the current trend could have significant impact on earnings. The Company's latest earnings report shows declining operating income in the Cable Network component of the Media Networks Segment. Source: The Walt Disney Company 2. A Thawing of Frozen. The company's mega-hit Frozen has driven earnings growth across the company, but in particular it has had a sizable impact on the company's consumer product segment with revenues up 22% in the segment last quarter and operating income up some 46%! While the Consumer Products segment's contribution to earnings is dwarfed by other segments, namely Media Networks and Parks and Resorts, it has played an outsized role in the earnings growth over the past several quarters. Any diminution in the popularity of Frozen themed products will impact the segment's earnings negatively. 3. A Marvel Miss. The company's studio business has been handed the growth baton from the Media Network's segment, leaving the company's earnings growth more exposed to the often unpredictable tastes of movie patrons. The company has leveraged the unsurpassed popularity of its franchises to mitigate the uncertainty of box office performance, but investors would be foolish to believe this strategy will work without fail. As Marvel studios turns from its more popular Avengers characters to less well known properties like Ant Man (due in July), and Pixar seeks to expand its catalog with this year's Inside Out and The Good Dinosaur, it is very likely that there will be misses. Perhaps the greatest unknown is how the company's treatment of the Star Wars franchise will be received by the space epic's legion of fans. A miss with Episode Seven or the inability to successfully spin off additional storylines with next year's Rogue One will significantly impact earnings growth expectations. 4. A Rich Target in a Broader Market Pull Back. Disney's valuation premium is well deserved (trading at nearly 24x ttm Earnings) but makes the company vulnerable in a larger market pull back. The Walt Disney Company is a must own growth story for the long term investor. The company is built for the 21st century media landscape on a foundation of world class iconic franchises. The company's current share price, however, reflects the company's perfect execution of its growth strategy over the next several quarters, which is likely unrealistic despite the company's superior management team. Investors should expect a pull back in the company's share price either as part of a larger market correction, or as a result of a company specific catalyst.
