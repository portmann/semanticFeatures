Yahoo: Daily Fantasy Sports The $1 Billion Call Option - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha YHOO's 1Q15 was largely expected by the market as display and search both showed minor weakness. Daily fantasy sports is a natural extension of YHOO's digital vertical, and I expect YHOO to become a meaningful player in this space. Options on Y!Japan, growth in digital assets and daily fantasy all point to the positive direction. Remain bullish on YHOO. Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) delivered an in-line revenue and EPS that fell shy of consensus estimates. The weakness in display ad and search revenue was largely expected by the market, in my view. What I believe is more important are YHOO's digital and mobile growth, the potential option of the Yahoo! Japan stake, and what I believe to be an overlooked area, fantasy sports. I believe that YHOO provides shareholders with attractive call options with its digital assets and monetization of its fantasy sports assets. Remain bullish on the name. Consolidated revenue of $1.04b was in-line with consensus while EPS missed by $0.03. Display ads decline of 7% was a further decline from Q4's 5% and it appears that YHOO continues to lose pricing power in this area with price per ad down 17% while volume was up 29%. Interestingly, search revenue also fell, down by 3%, suggesting that Mozilla may not be YHOO's only search savoir. The recent restructuring of the Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) deal opens the door for additional search partners in what I believe to include Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) given FB's prior interest in search and that search will be an important product for FB and its 2m clients. (see: Yahoo Q1 2015 Preview: Potential Tie-Up With Facebook? ) In short, I believe Q1's weakness was largely expected and that the market should not punish YHOO and focus on the growth of the digital assets, which I believe will be a bigger part of YHOO going forward. Yahoo's entry into the daily fantasy sports vertical is a natural extension of its fantasy sports business, which has traditionally hosted season-long fantasy games. Judging by the growth of FanDuels and DraftKings, each valued at $1b, I expect YHOO's fantasy sports to be as equally successful as the leading players, given YHOO's longer operating history and user base. While I acknowledge that the daily fantasy sports industry has been bubbly over the past several months with hundreds of startups coming online to capitalize on the fantasy sports market, there are an estimated over 40m fantasy sports participants in North America. That said, FanDuels and DrafKings only account for 5% of the total user base, which suggests plenty of room for YHOO to leverage its existing fantasy player base and fantasy news source, which are critical to participants when they select their lineups. While management did not give much color on the specifics, we can expect YHOO to have a launch by this summer, and I believe YHOO can be a formidable competitor to FanDuels and DraftKings on both PC and mobile fantasy sports. YHOO's digital assets continue to go gangbusters. YHOO clocked in 600 mobile MAUs, an increase of 20% y/y. More impressive is that Tumblr's monthly active viewers are inching closer to 500m with an expected $100m in revenue for this year. Engagement remains strong with 10% q/q growth and I see this to be accretive to Tumblr's long-term growth. Video stream growth of +262% suggests that YHOO, like most of the other video platforms, is also benefiting from the ad dollar shift from TV to video. While monetization may not come in as soon as investors had hoped, I sense that YHOO will continue to move towards the right direction. Remain bullish on YHOO on the back of growth in digital assets, potential search partnership with FB, ramp up of daily fantasy sports and additional clarity on the Yahoo Japan asset.
