Verizon: Little Dividend Growth Makes It An Overvalued Stock - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I am/we are long VZ. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. Verizon has been rewarded its shareholders with high yield and consistent dividend growth throughout the years. The company has now very little to offer besides its dividend yield. Unless it can unlock a lot of value from the AOL acquisition, Verizon should be considered a solid company paying a solid yield, but offering very limited growth perspectives. What Makes Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) a Good Business? Verizon is first and foremost a wireless carrier. The company covers 95% of the US and serves 109 million retail customers. VZ has been known for investing massively into its network year after year (they spent over $10 billion in 2014). Focusing on quality has secured VZ with the most loyal customers amongst wireless carriers in the USA. While margins are now under pressure due to higher competition from Sprint (NYSE: S ) and T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS ), Verizon and AT&T (NYSE: T ) own 60% of the wireless market. This oligopoly makes the industry very interesting for any dividend investor. The company has systematically shown strong revenue growth since 2011. Verizon has been very active in the acquisition of new wireless customers and focused on the reliability and quality of its network across the US to increase its client base year after year. We all have our methods for analyzing a company. Over the years of trading, I've been through several stock research methodologies from various sources. This is how I came up with my 7 investing principles of dividend investing . Let's take a closer look at them. My first investment principle goes against many income seeking investors' rule: I try to avoid most companies with a dividend yield over 5%. I make very few investments like these (you can read my case against high dividend yield here ). The reason is simple; when a company pays a high dividend, it's because the market thinks it's a risky investmentâ€¦ or that the company has nothing else but a constant cash flow to offer its investors. However, high yield hardly comes with dividend growth and this is what I am seeking most. From this point of view, Verizon shows a relatively high dividend yield as it is flirting with my highest yield acceptable. The fact that the company has been consistently increasing its dividend proves that the yield is not high due to a share price slump. VZ meets my first principle, barely. Principle #2: Focus on Dividend Growth My second investing principle relates to dividend growth as being the most important metric of all. It doesn't only prove management's trust in the company's future, but it is also a good sign of a sound business model. Over time, a dividend payment cannot be increased if the company is unable to increase its earnings. Steady earnings can't be derived from anything else but increasing revenue. Who doesn't want to own a company that shows rising revenues and earnings? The company has maintained or increased its dividend payment for 31 consecutive years. Most recently, we see a steady trend in the payment increase. Verizon is a true money making machine as its loyal clients subscribe to monthly plans and bring in the dough month after month. VZ meets my second principle. Principle #3: Find Sustainable Dividend Growth Stocks Past dividend growth history is always interesting and tells you a lot about what happened with a company. As investors, we are more concerned about the future than the past. This is why it is important to find companies that will be able to sustain their dividend growth. I like looking at both the dividend payout ratio and the cash dividend payout ratio. As you can see, the business has experienced periods where the regular payout ratio was completely ridiculous. This is because we look at an accounting number. The cash dividend payout ratio is more stable as it counts the company's available cash flow to be distributed to shareholders. We can see the company is getting closer to a 100% ratio in both cases. But for now, VZ meets my third principle. Principle #4: The Business Model Ensures Future Growth Verizon is the leader in the wireless industry in the USA with a 34% market share (followed by T with 30%). I believe its reputation based on quality protects VZ from many competitors over the long haul. The company understands its clients, who would rather pay a premium for a phone that will work everywhere than a cheaper package with occasional problems. I also like the fact the company is evolving in an oligopoly. While growth perspectives are not incredible within the wireless segment, Verizon has other alternatives to explore with the purchase of AOL in 2015. If it can unlock the value of AOL's internet advertising platform by merging it to its wireless services, we could be back to higher dividend increases for a while. As previously mentioned, the company has been a true ATM for any investor by providing steady and increasing dividend payments. Through its business model, the company shows the ability to generate strong cash flows. Besides dividends, VZ has been quite active in 2014 and 2015. Two years ago, management decided to buy back shares of Verizon Wireless owned at that time by Vodafone (NASDAQ: VOD ). Last year, it was the AOL acquisition at $4 billion. Finally, the company must invest over $10 billion to maintain and improve its network each year. This is a heavy cost of doing business. On one hand, this expense protects VZ from other competitors that want its market share, but it is also quite a burden to support during tougher years. Overall, VZ shows a strong business model and meets my fourth principle. Principle #5: Buy When You Have Money in Hand -- At The Right Valuation I think the perfect time to buy stocks is when you have money. Sleeping money is always a bad investment. However, it doesn't mean that you should buy everything you see because you have some cash put aside. There is valuation work to be done. To achieve this task, I will start by looking at how the stock market valued the stock over the past 10 years by looking at its P/E ratio: The company shows many ups and downs due to great variations in its earnings. Most recently, it seems the stock has been highly valued. This is probably due to a very low interest rate inviting income-seeking investors to acquire relatively high yielding companies such as telecoms and utilities. At this point, VZ seems overvalued to me. As a dividend investor, I will also use the dividend discount model (DDM) to see if VZ could be interesting as a dividend distributor. I use a 10% discount rate as I see Verizon as relatively risky due to its important need for cash flow to maintain its network. I used a 3% dividend growth rate for the first 10 years as it is in line with the past 5 years' average. Then, I used a 5% growth rate as I believe in the company's ability to generate more profits from the AOL acquisition: Source: Dividend Monk Toolkit Excel Calculation Spreadsheet As you can see, the company appears overvalued by about 10%. Since both methods lead to the same conclusion; VZ doesn't meet my fifth principle at the moment. Principle #6: The Rationale Used to Buy is Also Used to Sell I've found one of the biggest investor struggles is to know when to buy and when to sell holdings. I use a very simple, but very effective rule to overcome my emotions when it is the time to pull the trigger. My investment decisions are motivated by the fact that the company confirms my investment thesis or not. Once the reasons (my investment thesis) why I purchased shares of a company are no longer valid, I sell and never look back. The idea behind an investment in Verizon is obviously its steady and relatively high dividend yield. The company's dividend payment is safe for several years to come and this is the kind of stock that could easily replace a bond in one's portfolio. You don't expect too much growth from the stock price, but a steady 5% yield is more than any safe bond on the street. While the company is solid today, this doesn't mean an investor must become complacent. Technology evolves very fast and a few bad moves (like buying AOL and not being able to unlock its value) combined with a network demanding heavy cash flow could lead to some serious difficulties in a few years. Room for growth in the wireless business alone is limited and VZ must find other ways to increase its growth potential over the long haul. Principle #7: Think Core, Think Growth My investing strategy is divided into two segments: the core portfolio built with strong and stable stocks meeting all our requirements. The second part is called the "dividend growth stock addition," where I may ignore one of the metrics mentioned in principles #1 to #5 for a greater upside potential (e.g., riskier pick as well). Having both segments helps me to categorize my investments into a "conservative" or "core" section or into a "growth" section. I then know exactly what to expect from it; a steady dividend payment or higher fluctuations with a greater growth potential. Verizon is more a conservative stock that will generate a solid cash flow. At the moment, it could also easily fit into a growth portfolio if you are one of the believers in the AOL acquisition. This could be definitely be a game changer for Verizon. Higher risk, higher reward. Final Thoughts on VZ -- Buy, Hold or Sell? Overall, Verizon is a good fit for any investor looking for a steady high dividend yield. It is one of the rare companies paying a 5% yield and showing a safe outlook in the upcoming years at the same time. However, considering the current value, this is not the right time to buy it. The company is solid, but is trading at a 10% premium. Disclaimer: I hold VZ in my DividendStocksRock portfolios.
