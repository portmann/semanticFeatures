Why I Still Like Disney - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Shares of Walt Disney Company have pulled back from their unsustainable surge of early 2015 and now represent a much better value than several months ago. There are many catalysts for growth in the Disney empire, including a release schedule full of blockbuster sequels that should help theme parks as well. As I said in August 2014, Disney remains a buy on dips, and the current dip is worth considering for those who maintain a long-term perspective. I last wrote about Walt Disney Co. (NYSE: DIS ) in a August 5, 2014 article, Disney: A Buy on Dips . The stock closed at $86.75 on that date, and since has traded in a wide range. It traded as low as $78.54 on October 15, 2014, and as high as $122.08 on August 4, 2015, exactly one year after my article. It indeed was a great buy on dips throughout that period. At its peak, the stock was up over 40% in the year after I published that article. Since that latter date, the stock has pulled back significantly. Let's take a look and see if this is another good buying opportunity. The long-term chart shows that Disney has long periods where it generates a bandwagon effect and gets a little ahead of itself. A good example was during the latter stages of the Disney Renaissance era , 1998-2000. Ultimately, though, Disney plugs along and generates good returns for shareholders. The trick is just to buy it at the right times to maximize your long-term profits. As the chart shows, DIS currently is in one of its rare pullbacks. If you like Disney, this is the time to give it a long look. Based On Past Price Performance, Disney Has Returned To Normal Disney has been one of the prime beneficiaries of the stock market rally of the past three years. It rose in a very well-defined channel throughout that period. However, in early 2015 it broke through the top of that channel as it sought its highs in the $120s. DIS chart April-October 2015. The two parallel red lines indicate a price channel that extends back to mid-2011. The fact that Disney has returned to its long-term uptrend channel makes it a much more reasonable buy than it was when it underwent its most recent bandwagon effect and got ahead of itself. Disney Has Many Catalysts For Growth Source: Dailydot.com . Release dates are always tentative and subject to change. Regardless of whether Disney actually produced a film through its own unit or one of its subsidiaries such as Pixar (as with most of the films on the list), or simply is acting as the distributor, it stands to benefit from popular releases. There are several sequels in top franchises on the list, such as the two Star Wars films, the Toy Story sequel, the follow-up to the huge " Guardians of the Galaxy " smash hit of 2014, and the Johnn Depp Pirates of the Caribbean sequel. Sequels in a popular franchise are the surest revenue-producers in Hollywood and have many advantages over original films. There also is evidence that buying Disney before big releases is a good strategy . Picking up a few shares before the December 2015 "Star Wars" release may not be a bad idea. Theme parks are another major source of Disney revenue. They do not exist in isolation; theme parks benefit from successful film franchises, with new rides and other attractions . While perhaps not absolutely necessary to theme park survival, the continuation of franchises and initiation of new ones keeps the parks from getting stale. Disney Chairman/CEO Bob Iger announced recently that both Disneyland and Walt Disney World will be updated with "Star Wars" attractions. Disney, of course, knows all this. That is why executives there have begun floating the idea of demand-based pricing at its theme parks. CNBC calls this "Uber-Style Pricing" after the new taxi alternative company Uber, showing that the idea of tier pricing is cutting edge and facing customer acceptance across the spectrum. Disney also just announced that it is raising annual pass prices and introducing a new $1000 pass. It seems pretty clear that there is a direct connection between the loaded Disney release schedule and Disney changing its pass offerings and suddenly moving toward tier pricing after 60 years of resisting it. So far, the picture is all bright and sunny. The release schedule full with top-notch films, and that should help revenues at the theme parks. To be sure, there are legitimate concerns about some jewels in the Disney crown. About half of Disney's operating income comes from its cable channels such as ESPN and the Disney Channel. Some have questioned the future of cable offerings during an age of cord-cutting, which arguably is an accelerating trend . Those concerns are legitimate in the abstract. Disney's response is that ESPN has locked in long-term contracts with major attractions such as the NBA, and Chairman Iger floated the idea of new deals to distribute its cable offerings over the Internet should the cord-cutting trend become a real problem. Disney also has made a big bet on a new theme park in Shanghai, China. Called Shanghai Disneyland , it is scheduled to open in Spring 2016. The park occupies 1000 acres and cost $5.5 billion. Expectations are high , but not all overseas parks succeed. The shaky Chinese economy is a wild card, but there is a lot of evidence of Disney's popularity in Asia. Disney is a great company, and kids love it. But you have to buy it at the right times to do well, as the chart below of its stock price during the decade 1995-2006 shows. Insiders appear to like the stock around current levels, with several insiders making small buys at the end of September (which is not typical for every month). I don't want to make too much of this insider buying. Insiders were selling earlier in the year. However, that was when, as pointed out above, the stock price was surging in what I would characterize as an unsustainable fashion. Disney also pays a small dividend which currently is about 1.27%, which is always a nice quarterly bonus for owning the stock. Overall, Disney appears to be in solid shape as a growth company with good value characteristics. I picked some up in late August for the Generation Portfolio that I manage. Disney has pulled back from its recent unsustainable surge above its long-term price channel. Just as I said back in August 2014, it remains a buy on dips, and represents a good value at current levels. There are several catalysts for growth, and concerns about Disney's cable channels are real, but most likely manageable by Disney management. Disney remains a long-term buy, and I always keep an eye on it for its rare, but always appetizing, buying opportunities.
