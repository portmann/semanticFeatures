Paccar: Primed For Activism - PACCAR Inc. (NASDAQ:PCAR) | Seeking Alpha PACCAR designs and manufactures light-, medium- and heavy-duty trucks. The company has consistently grown earnings year over year. It has a large and consistent cash balance that is not being invested or being redeployed to accrete value. Activists could make a case for the company to take advantage of low rates to issue debt in order to repurchase stock or grow the dividend. PACCAR Inc. (NASDAQ: PCAR ) is a company that could see Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) like activism in the near future. The firm has consistently grown earnings, has a large cash balance, and currently has no debt. PACCAR is in a completely different industry than Apple. It designs and manufactures light-, medium- and heavy-duty trucks and operates globally under the Kenworth, Peterbilt, DAF, and Leyland Trucks brands. The company is one of the top 3 truck makers in the world. PACCAR has been consistently growing earnings per share (EPS), not unlike Apple. The company grew EPS by 16% from 2013 to 2014 and is expected to grow EPS by 18% this year to an estimated $4.51 per share. It is also expected to grow earnings next year by 5% over this year's forecast. If investors look over a longer time horizon, analysts are expecting earnings to grow at an average annual rate of 11% over the next five years . As of Monday, June 8th, the stock trades at a price of $63.35 per share, which implies a dividend yield from its regular quarterly dividend of 1.38%. Investors must note that the company pays a regular special cash dividend at the end of each year. This past year, the company paid a $1 special cash dividend , which would imply a dividend yield of 2.97% versus Apple's dividend yield of around 1.71%. The company grew the special cash dividend 25% year over year and is expected to raise it this year as well. The stock trades at a last twelve months' P/E multiple of 15.5x. Using the next twelve months' earnings per share estimate of $4.51, this implies a forward P/E multiple of 14x, which is well below the S&P 500 index's current forward multiple. The company sits on $2.7 billion in Cash and Cash Equivalents as of December 31st, 2014. This implies $7.60 per share on the balance sheet. The company consistently keeps large cash balances. If investors look at the ex-cash P/E multiple, which subtracts the cash per share on the balance sheet from the share price, the next twelve months' multiple is 12x. This is slightly higher than Apple's. Investors sometimes view the ex-cash multiples over traditional methods because if the company were to get acquired, this is what would be paid for it. To visualize this, if a consumer were to buy a $100 wallet with $20 already in it, the consumer is effectively paying $80 for the wallet. The company currently has no schedule 13D filings , which is the primary filing needed for activism with the SEC. With a lot of cash on the balance sheet, just like in the case with Apple, it's not uncommon for investors to want that cash to be returned to shareholders since it's not being invested or otherwise being redeployed to accrete value. PACCAR currently has no debt. Activists could make the case for the company to take advantage of low rates to issue debt in order to repurchase stock or grow the dividend. If PACCAR is able to issue debt at a lower rate than its dividend yield, it may make sense to use the proceeds to buy back stock. Ideally the company will be paying less to finance the debt than the stock. There are also other advantages to issuing debt. If PACCAR were to issue debt, it will be able to deduct the interest expense to lower its taxes. There are many strategies an activist may call for. Apple, just like PACCAR, had no debt, growing earnings, and large cash balances on its balance sheet before investor activism. Apple then issued debt at low rates to buy back stock and increase the stock dividend. This strategy is a possibility with PACCAR.
