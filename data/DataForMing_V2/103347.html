'Dumping Apple Makes Sense For Immediate Growth' - Or Does It? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Regarded Solutions released a hit article titled "Dumping Apple makes sense for immediate growth". I will contend that lower yield does not equal lower income over the long run for investors looking for DGI. On April 12th, Seeking Alpha contributor Regarded Solutions released an article titled "Dumping Apple makes sense for immediate income growth ". His article touched on the debate of whether Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) should be sold to buy shares that provide a higher dividend yield for investors. He decided to swap his Apple shares for the higher yielding AT&T (NYSE: T ). I will try to convey why I believe that taking this action was a mistake, especially for anyone with a medium to long investment horizon. I think it would be appropriate to give a little introduction of myself, as this will help you understand my point of view. I am a 22-year-old student who started learning about investing at 17. I started off by day trading with leverage but soon realized that although you can make large gains very quickly, you can also see your positions be wiped out in pre-market trading the day after entering a position. After 6 months, I decided to change my strategy to investing for the medium to long term with a strong emphasis on dividend growth, and have not looked back since. Apple shares now yield 1.5% after the price has appreciated by over 50%. Should I sell the shares and buy a company such as AT&T to increase my income? Should new investors of Apple shares be put off by its current dividend yield of 1.5%? As I own stocks for the medium to long term for their total return (capital appreciation and income from dividends), I do not sell when the share price temporarily falls. In addition to this, I do not sell when the dividend yield also temporarily falls due to capital appreciation of the share price. This is exactly what has happened here with Apple. As Regarded Solutions noted: "When Apple shares split 7:1, it was selling for $70.00/share, which at today's dividend rate of $2.08/share would have translated to a yield of nail-bitingly close to 3%." As previously mentioned, the share price appreciated over 50% in such a short period of time that the dividend yield fell to 1.5%. For any income seekers, this was absolutely nothing to be intimidated by as the income per share had not fallen. (Note $70/s refers to post split price). Regarded Solutions argued that for immediate income, AT&T would be a better choice. For IMMEDIATE income, that is definitely true, due to AT&T's dividend yield at 5.1% compared to Apple's 1.5%. However, I believe that acting for short-term gains is greatly detrimental to future returns. I will show you how by comparing these two companies. From the past 4 years, we can see Apple has delivered an average of 10% income increases compounded year on year, whereas AT&T has only increased the income on average by a measly 2.16%. Well, which stock provides the biggest income increase over that time period? The next chart will show the change in yield on cost over that same 4-year period using the average dividend increase of 10% per year for Apple and 2.16% for AT&T. As you can see, Apple's dividend increases over the last 4 years are far superior to AT&T's. Let's compare other statistics (provided by Wikinvest and Nasdaq.com) Apple has grown revenue by 20.5% YoY. AT&T has had EPS decrease of 6.9% YoY Apple has had EPS increase of 39% YoY An income-seeking investor might pose the question, "why should I care if my income stock does not have high revenue and EPS growth if it still provides a dividend"? It is true that many companies can continue to pay out dividends with flat revenue and EPS for long periods of time. But there are several risks inherent to this scenario. Companies can create a mirage whereby they offer increasing dividends by reducing the share capital, thus resulting in more money being allocated to each share for the dividend. This can give the illusion of growth. The earnings per share are increasing, however, the underlying growth in organic earnings might be flat or even negative. This can diminish shareholder value due to buying back shares when they are not presenting value, and can leave the company short of cash in market downturns, especially in cyclical companies. A company with increasing organic growth and revenue creates a margin of safety, or buffer zone, for the safety of dividends and generally allows that company to increase the dividend payout over time. Paying out increasing dividends when the dividend payout ratio is already high (I would say 70%+) puts your dividend AND capital at risk. Examples of this can be seen from companies affected by the sharp fall in the price of oil. Look no further than the high dividend paying offshore drillers such as Transocean (NYSE: RIG ) (which I unfortunately had a position in) and Seadrill (NYSE: SDRL ). Before the fall, both companies paid out huge dividends, but when they desperately needed to cut the dividend, many investors sold, causing the share price to fall dramatically along with the dividend payouts. Apple has a very small payout ratio of 23% compared to AT&T's 74.6%, giving it that much-needed room to increase payouts over time safely. In addition, Apple has approximately $200b in cash and equivalents. Even still, I think that most investors do not truly appreciate this. Apple is on track to produce over $200b in income every 4 years. This figure assumes flat growth and revenue, which is incomprehensible due to the large growth we are seeing across Asia. For those seeking income, chasing stocks with the highest dividend yield is not the right path. Yes, for that one year your income will be higher, but you could be putting your capital at risk. I would suggest looking for companies that might not necessarily have the highest dividend yield, but have the best ability to pay out increasing dividends over the long term. For the foreseeable future Apple is one of those companies, and I do not think there is any sense in making short-term income gains a priority over total return. On a final point: I know that many authors too commonly refer to quotes from Warren Buffett. One of the most common phrases I have seen is to treat your shares like the businesses they are, not a ticker on your computer screen with an ever-changing price tag. Every time I have seen this, it is always assumed to be referring to the share price. However, investors need to apply that idea when seeking income, too. The dividends are a result of the health of the underlying business. When you try to chase yield over a company's ability to pay increasing dividends, you are putting both your income and capital at risk.
