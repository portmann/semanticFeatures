Does Q1 Earnings Make Einhorn Right On Yelp? - Yelp (NYSE:YELP) | Seeking Alpha Since David Einhorn announced he was long Yelp, there's been a renewed interest in the company's potential and valuation. Following strong Q1 earnings, investors may be even more convinced by his thesis. Yet even with the outlook seeming bright, investors should be aware of the numerous competitive pressures and risks Yelp faces. Unless there's a near term sale of the company, Yelp faces the risk of becoming obsolete as competitors such as Google and Facebook may be better positioned. To be frank, I use Yelp (NYSE: YELP ) all the time. Whenever I'm looking for a business or restaurant review, I always seem to end up on Yelp. Then again, I always used to use MapQuest as well until Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) swooped in and took over the space. While I partially agree with David Einhorn that Yelp is impressive and quite dominant because of its massive database of reviews, I'm not sure how long that will last as competitors like Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) and Google gain ground. Revenues were up 34% quarter over quarter Cumulative reviews were up 31% quarter over quarter, breaking the 100mm mark Adjusted EBITDA was down to $13mm compared to $16.3mm in 1Q15. Notably, stock comp was $19.1mm, which is much greater than Adjusted EBITDA and a bit ridiculous in my opinion. Revenue guidance for 2016 is expected to be in the range of $690mm to $702mm. Adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2016 is expected to be in the range of $93mm to $105mm. Notably, stock comp guidance for 2016 is expected to be in the range of $84mm to $87mm, which again, is practically all of the company's EBITDA. If Yelp's stock price begins to appreciate to levels that Einhorn expects, that stock comp will most definitely be a real expense When you want look up a review for a business or restaurant, do you 'Yelp' it or 'Google' it? I can pretty confidently say that most people will head to Google first, THEN click on the link to a Yelp review. That's the key problem with Yelp's business model. Most users don't start out at Yelp. Google is the real middleman here. Notice Google Reviews starting to pop up more and more when you do a search? Why bother with Yelp if Google already has the results you need? As Google begins to generate a bigger and bigger base of reviews, users won't need Yelp any more. Yelp could go the way of MapQuest, and end up an afterthought. Google's not the only threat to Yelp. Facebook could become just dominant too. More and more businesses are starting to promote their businesses on Facebook. At the same time, advertising spend has taken off at Facebook and it has proven quite effective. Facebook can offer companies and advertisers much more than someone like Yelp can. The key is that Google and Facebook are PLATFORMS. Yelp is just a website. I believe it's only a matter of time before Facebook or Google's reviews database is just as competitive as Yelps. Yelp's main advantage now is that they do have the most dominant source of reviews. They've got a nice head start on their database of reviews, along with a base of users that are pretty familiar with using Yelp's platform. Then again, users are just as familiar with using Facebook and Google. Facebook and Google just haven't caught up...yet. Einhorn is probably right when he say's there would be a bidding war for Yelp if it was put up for auction. Someone like Google or Facebook could easily just roll Yelp into their platform, further bolstering their database of reviews. The question is for how much? Einhorn seemed pretty convinced that Yelp could hit $300mm of EBITDA by 2019. I would have to think he's adding back stock based comp, seeing as Yelp's true projected EBITDA for 2016 would only be $9 to $18mm if they didn't add back their ridiculous amount of stock comp. If we assume they hit that $300mm mark in 2019 and $150mm of that is stock comp, the company's real EBITDA would only be $150mm, placing a 9x EV/EBITDA multiple on the company. That may look 'low' to you, but remember this is a 2019 estimate, and the acquirer will most certainly be paying that massive stock comp expense if they buy Yelp. I'm not one to make a bet on companies solely based off of a potential future acquisition, especially when it's valuation would be based off a dramatically larger 3 year EBITDA estimate. I'm a bit too skeptical on Yelp's long term prospects to get comfortable with an investment here. More importantly, the valuation just seems a bit too ludicrous with such a ridiculous amount of stock comp representing the company's 'adjusted' EBITDA. While the quarter looked good, I wonder how many more quarters the company will have before Google and Facebook start eating their lunch.
