Sure, it works great for snapping self-portraits and means you don’t have to ask strangers to take your picture. But it sure as heck isn’t a good thing to use on a roller coaster while it’s in motion. Yeah, we’re looking at you, person who whipped out one of the gadgets on a ride at Disneyland. The rider’s ill-fated photo opportunity happened around 5:30 on Monday afternoon on the California Screamin’ Roller coaster at Disney California Adventure Park in Anaheim, CA, KTLA.com reports. A Disney spokeswoman said the rider was spotted using the selfie stick, forcing park officials to shut down the ride and remove all the passengers. FOX-LA reports that the riders were stranded for the hour that the ride was down, but it’s unclear how quick the evacuation process was. Disney banned selfie sticks in all its Disneyland and Disney World theme parks last June â€” a policy that went into place a week after another visitor pulled out a selfie-stick mid-ride on the very same roller coaster . â€œWe strive to provide a great experience for the entire family, and unfortunately selfie-sticks have become a growing safety concern for both our guests and cast,â€? a Disney World spokeswoman said at the time. Other places selfie sticks are not allowed: Smithsonian Museums , as well as a bunch of other cultural institutions like the Museum of Modern Art and The Guggenheim . It’s also not a great idea to get so distracted by your selfie stick that you get too close to a bison or a bear in the wild. A Good Way To Ruin A Roller Coaster Ride For Everyone Else?
