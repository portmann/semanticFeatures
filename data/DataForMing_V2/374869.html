Why Isn't Anybody Shorting Apple? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Short interest dropped another 9.8 million shares. Apple now one of least shorted large-cap tech names. A couple of weeks ago, I detailed how the sentiment around shares of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) was not what you might think . Despite all of the bearishness regarding iPhone sales and falling fiscal Q2 revenues, short interest was at a multi-year low. Recently, the end of February update on short interest came in, and the trend of short sellers covering has continued in a large way. In fact, Apple is now one of the least shorted tech giants in the market today. In my previous article, I mentioned how short interest for Apple was near its lowest point that I've seen since I started tracking this item in April 2012. Well, another 9.8 million shares were covered by the end of February. With short interest now under 50 million shares, I had to adjust the y-axis of the short interest chart, seen below. The latest short interest number marks a new low, the least amount of shares short in roughly 4 years (split-adjusted). Source: NASDAQ Apple short interest page The number of shares short is a single data point, so there are many ways to look at it. One primary way I do is in terms of the stock's float, the number of shares actually available for trading. According to Yahoo! Finance , Apple's float is 5.54 billion shares, meaning about 0.86% of Apple's float is short, less than 1 in every 100 shares. In the overall market, this number is relatively low. When you look at some high-growth areas, the 3D printing sector or stocks such as GoPro (NASDAQ: GPRO ) and Tesla Motors (NASDAQ: TSLA ), you can see times when 20%, 30% or more of the float is short. But to do a realistic comparison for Apple, we really should look at some other major technology names. In the chart below, I did just that, comparing Apple against Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), IBM (NYSE: IBM ), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO ), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) and Oracle (NYSE: ORCL ). (Note: Settlement date for short interest of names above is either 2/29 or 3/1, depending on NASDAQ reporting date.) For the ten stocks above, the straight average comes to 1.38% of float shorted. If we take out Apple which is well below that, the nine-stock peer group average comes to 1.44%. This means Apple is about 40% less shorted than average, which is a considerable amount. Only Microsoft is less shorted than Apple, and those are the only two stocks below 1.00%. Of the group above, Apple is one of four stocks estimated to show both revenue and earnings declines in its current fiscal period . Oracle is in a similar revenue situation to Apple, although Apple isn't expected to see as much of an EPS decline. IBM and Qualcomm are forecast to see even greater top and bottom line declines. Of these four, Apple has the best buyback program at the moment, while IBM and Qualcomm have the highest dividend yields. Microsoft, the only stock less shorted than Apple, is expected to see a revenue decline in its current fiscal year, but EPS are forecast to jump. In the second half of February, there was a bit of news regarding Apple other than the FBI phone saga. Apple launched another bond offering , probably for helping the buyback plan, although the coupon rates were a bit higher than normally hoped. On the negative side, recent Apple bull Carl Icahn trimmed his position in the stock, selling nearly seven million shares. Additionally, SMBC Nikko cut its iPhone demand forecast by 30 million units after another reported round of production cutbacks . Given mostly negative news, you might have expected short interest to increase for Apple, but it went the other way. Apple shares traded higher as the month ended, and have regained the $100 mark here in March. So, I ask the key question again in regards to Apple: where are all of the short sellers? I continue to hear iPhone sales are struggling, revenues and earnings are going to decline in the period, etc. However, short interest in the stock is actually declining, showing that investors don't believe the stock is headed lower. The number of shares short is at its lowest point in the nearly four years I've tracked for Apple. The stock is also the second least shorted of ten major large cap tech names. If things at Apple are really that bad, why are short sellers covering in large quantities?
