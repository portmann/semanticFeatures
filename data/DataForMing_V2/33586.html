2 Reasons AT&T Is The Better Dividend Investment Than Verizon - AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) | Seeking Alpha To screen ETFs by asset class, performance, yield and more, check out the ETF Hub. ETF Hub Morningstar's Josh Peters recently said Verizon is the better long-term dividend stock than AT&T. Despite AT&T's dividend being 30% higher, Peters believes VZ has more dividend upside long-term. However, AT&T has less debt and stock dilution. Josh Peters, editor of Morningstar's DividendInvestor, recently said Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) is the better dividend investment over AT&T (NYSE: T ). Peters claims that Verizon is allocating capital better, growing its dividend faster and can afford its dividend easier relative to free cash flow, thereby making it the better investment. However, Peters is wrong, and there are two very simple, fundamental reasons why. Let's ignore the obvious fact that AT&T pays a higher dividend than Verizon - 5.7% versus 4.5% - as the difference in yield pretty much explains the free cash flow to dividend payout argument: AT&T's dividend requires more capital to pay versus Verizon because it is higher. Verizon may be growing its dividend faster, but unless Peters anticipates a near 30% hike this year, Verizon will remain a laggard behind AT&T's dividend. That said, there are two very simple reasons why Peters is wrong, and the first centers around each company's potential to raise capital, fund operations and increase dividend payments long-term. While Peters believes Verizon has better dividend hiking prospects long-term, the following chart begs to differ. Verizon has $30 billion more debt than AT&T. With so much debt, it will be hard for Verizon to raise capital and protect its credit rating to fund spectrum bids, capital expenditures and future acquisitions. In addition, Verizon has increased its share count by nearly 50% over the last year compared to AT&T, who has reduced its outstanding shares by 12% in the same period. Thus, Verizon won't be able to increase its share count for future expenses either. In essence, Verizon has put itself in a spot where free cash flow must be used to pay off debt. With rising costs and lower profits its chances of surpassing AT&T's yield seems unlikely. This brings up the second reason AT&T is better, and that's each company's market opportunity. Just last week Cowen released its quarterly wireless survey, showing that monthly prices once more slipped. Verizon's revenue per user fell 5% quarter-over-quarter to $143 during the first quarter, whereas AT&T's was near flat at $143. With these two companies targeting the same U.S. market, being near the same size, and monthly prices falling, there's a good chance that profits will fall as well; especially on money earned in a mature, crowded U.S. market. In essence, that's why AT&T's opportunity to create higher free cash flow is greater than Verizon. AT&T has made a big move into Mexico and Latin America with two acquisitions in the former and the pending purchase of DirecTV in the latter region. Right now, AT&T offers services across the border, and its network is larger than Verizon by roughly 100 million potential customers. In other words, AT&T has a much larger market opportunity than Verizon. Even if AT&T can gain 15 million subscribers in Mexico, that's 15 million in a market that Verizon doesn't have, and according to CFO Fran Shammo , a market that Verizon has no intention to enter. AT&T then earns that $143 per month from those subscribers, and thereby creates higher profits for dividend growth. The bottom line is that AT&T has a stronger balance sheet, a less diluted stock, a larger market opportunity, and already has a big dividend lead on Verizon. Therefore, I am not sure how Verizon is the superior option. In my opinion, investors are much better off owning AT&T long-term, not only because of its dividend, but because its acquisitions and expanded market make way for new growth and higher free cash flow long-term.
