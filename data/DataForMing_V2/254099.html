Netflix Investors Whistling Past The Graveyard - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Investors have no rational basis to value Netflix as they do. Netflix cannot compete with deep-pocket rivals. We know that investors are valuing Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) at an irrational valuation. Yet it is worth examining just how irrational this valuation is. When coupled with a rational assessment of Netflix's truthful prospects going forward, it becomes apparent that NFLX stock represents the short of the century - provided you have the stomach to stick it out. The TTM P/E ratio of Netflix which, as of Wednesday's close, was 338. NFLX is not likely to make more than FY14's $267 million in net income, as it has only made $79.4 million YTD, per its Q3 report. Clearly investors are not valuing NFLX stock on a P/E basis. Are they valuing it on a rational cash flow basis? NFLX has negative TTM operational cash flow of $543 million. Non-GAAP free cash flow is even worse, coming in at negative $722 million. NFLX is burning cash to keep itself warm, and investors clearly aren't valuing the company on a cash flow basis. Is there something happening on a segment basis that is exciting investors? Domestic streaming is where things look bright, generating $1.252 billion in gross profit for the TTM. This is offset by international streaming with a $303 million loss in the TTM. Total streaming TTM gross profit is $772 million. Not bad. Domestic DVD profit is shrinking heavily year over year, but still pulled in $330 million in TTM gross profit. So in total, there's $1.014 billion in contribution profit. Alas, that is offset by $893 million in expenses. Domestic streaming margins have been consistent YTD, at around 32%. International streaming margins are worse this year, at -16%. 1) DVD profit will be gone in 2-3 years, and contributing less each year. 2) Domestic streaming will probably increase 25-30% YOY, down from the 50% YOY increase in FY14. 3) NFLX will continue to throw money at international expansion and continue to lose money there for some time. It will probably exceed last year's FY loss of $160 million by expanding to $290 million. 5) It has billions in off-balance sheet content liabilities. 6) It will have to raise prices and capital. Investors are valuing NFLX stock based on subscriber count for no rational reason whatsoever. Subscriber count means nothing. That's because NFLX is not Twitter, where subscriber count is everything. Twitter is a brand and platform that cannot be reproduced -- and guess what -- it still is losing money. NFLX is a brand in a rapidly commoditizing business, in which brand will soon mean nothing. Subscribers will go where the price is right, where the content they want is available, and every other competitor has pricing power over NFLX because they have way more capital - tens of billions more. NFLX is nothing more than a dumb pipe with a brand name, but there is nothing proprietary about it. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), and Hulu - owned by Disney (NYSE: DIS ), 21st Century Fox (NASDAQ: FOXA ) and Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) - are all viable competitors. None have totally committed to content streaming in the way NFLX has, but they will. When a studio produces movies or TV shows, it distributes them on DVD and streaming media. Anyone can buy DVDs and rent them out an infinite number of times. People still buy DVDs for their collections, and parents get lots of DVDs for kids. Studios make some money on DVDs. The studio can also license its content exclusively to one streaming provider. Because it is an exclusive deal, it will charge more for that content. For example, NFLX ponied up big bucks for Disney's movies. All other content is sold on a non-exclusive basis. So all streamers strike deals with the studio to exhibit their content. If NFLX doesn't have the content you want, you can rent it somewhere else on an a la carte basis, or subscribe to another service that does have it. Thus, there is very little that is special about NFLX as a streaming service. They have some exclusive licensed content. They produce some great original programming in an attempt to attract new subscribers and retain others, but it comes at enormous expense. Eventually, Netflix will run into cash flow problems. If it can't make certain content payments, it will re-negotiate those deals. Why would the studios do that? Because the studios want to bleed Netflix just down to where it is barely able to survive, so it can bleed it again and again. The studios will take lower prices on non-exclusive deals just to bank the revenue. NFLX has zero leverage. The studios don't need NFLX. They want it to live. They want it to raise capital, so they can bleed it again. But they don't need it. Just look at Disney. They made exclusive deals to license content to NFLX. If NFLX goes away, they can still offer both exclusive licenses, or license stuff on a non-exclusive basis. And you know what? There will always be buyers. Why? BECAUSE IT'S DISNEY CONTENT. And neither you nor I will care if NFLX lives or dies, because as long as we can get our content someplace, we will be happy. I own Disney stock for a reason. NFLX stock is the sucker's bet. Disney uses NFLX as its blood bank. Why are investors so excited to throw in with the blood bank when they could be invested with the vampire? If you've got the stomach, short NFLX. It's ultimate value will be determined by its ability to make good on content payments that retain subscribers. If international streaming becomes as profitable as domestic (a long way off) and domestic eventually nets $500 million in net profit, that's $1 billion in total profit, but without any growth. Give it a 5x value, and it's a $5 billion company...90% below today's valuation. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
