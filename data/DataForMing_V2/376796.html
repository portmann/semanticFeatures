Piper: 'Zootopia' success backs our bullish stance on Disney - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Mar 15 2016, 18:14 ET | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Walt Disney ( DIS -0.6%) is the beneficiary of bullish sentiment from Piper Jaffray, which is pointing to animation success Zootopia as reinforcement for its thesis. The firm's analyst Stan Meyers has reiterated Piper's Overweight rating and $120 price target, 22% upside from today's close of $98.22. Zootopia crested the $400M worldwide box-office mark this week and has benefited from strong positive audience reaction; it received an "A-" from audience rater CinemaScore and is currently "99% fresh" on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. The film is " outperforming expectations by 50-60% and supporting our thesis that Disney's film slate (combined with consumer products and theme parks) will drive the overall performance at an accelerated pace over the next three years," Meyers writes. Content strength leads to strong merchandise sales, including fashion at Forever 21, Meyers notes. "Based on our channel checks, merchandise (apparel in particular) is selling out quickly with dresses already out of stock, boding well for the Consumer Products segment."
