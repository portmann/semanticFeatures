Why I Sold My Position In Fitbit And Won't Be Returning - Fitbit, Inc. (NYSE:FIT) | Seeking Alpha Fitbit has seen its market share in the wearables space drop from 44% in Q1 2014 to just 24% in Q2 2015. Pressure is coming from the Apple Watch and Xiaomi's Mi Band. The Apple Watch could capture the top spot in wearables sales as early as this quarter. I was fortunate enough to pick up shares in Fitbit (NYSE: FIT ) shortly after it went public at $32 per share. I sold my position at almost $40 a share a couple of weeks ago and am obviously happy with the 25% gain I picked up in the process. However, I don't believe Fitbit is the same investment it was just a few months ago. The company's position in the wearables space has changed and that's why I won't be jumping on board again any time soon. While projected growth and increasing unit sales in the wearables sector get most of the headlines it's Fitbit's market share erosion that concerns me the most. Fitbit has gone from 1.7M units sold in Q1 2014 to 3.9M units in Q1 2015. In the most recent IDC survey for the 2nd quarter , Fitbit sold 4.4M units - a rise of 159% from the same quarter in 2014. But Fitbit looks like it's under a lot of pressure from competitors entering the wearables space. In Q1 2014, Fitbit was the undisputed king with a 44% market share with competitors like Jawbone and Garmin (NASDAQ: GRMN ) far behind. In 2014, Xiaomi introduced the Mi Band and by Q1 2015 had captured nearly a 25% market share and, in the process, dropping Fitbit's market share to 34%. In 2015, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) debuted the Apple Watch to compete with Fitbit. Shortly after hitting the market indications were that Apple Watch sales were dropping rapidly and that it perhaps wouldn't provide as much competition to Fitbit as was originally thought. But Apple debuted at #2 in the Q2 2015 survey with 3.6M units and a 20% market share. Apple had been pretty tight lipped about how the watch had been selling giving the impression that the sales were disappointing but this survey suggests it could actually be selling better than expected. In a year and a half, Fitbit has gone from dominating the wearable space with a 44% market share to leading the sector with just a 24% market share while Apple and Xiaomi right on their tails. We know what happens when companies try to compete with Apple so we could very see Apple in the top spot in these ranking as early as the 3rd quarter. Also concerning it Fitbit's lack of product diversity. Fitbit is currently limited to the fitness space almost exclusively. Obviously, Apple has a very diverse lineup of products and services and analysts had already been talking about the relatively minor damage that would be caused to the company overall if the product disappointed. Even a company like Garmin is diversified with its GPS unit exposure showing up in the fitness, automotive, marine and aviation industries. Fitbit will obviously work on broadening its influence over time but in the current environment it's dependent on the success of its fitness products. Fitbit is still the leader in the wearable space so it's not like its demise is imminent but the company has a lot of work to do to establish itself for the long term. There's no telling if wearable fitness items are more fad than staple so Fitbit will need to continue to evolve and may need to do it sooner than later. Fitbit is a stock I'll be avoiding for the foreseeable future. For those looking for exposure to this sector, Garmin and its nearly 5% dividend could be a consideration.
