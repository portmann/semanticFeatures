Research: In-depth coverage of more than 5200 stocks, many of which have little or no coverage         elsewhere. Besides Apple, macroeconomic weakness and China slowdown have hit the stock hard, but fears seem exaggerated. Apple has more models coming, while the increasing content per phone and strong position among the Chinese manufacturers should serve the business well. The IDP segment is largely ignored, but the business continues to grow nicely and is positioned very well for further growth. Qorvo Inc. ( QRVO ) stock is suffering along with the rest of the Apple ( AAPL ) supplier base. Besides the weaker than expected demand for iPhones, semiconductor names in the food chain are facing pressure due to the expected cyclical slowdown as well. Even though headwinds look strong right now, fundamentals suggest this might be a good time to take a closer look at the businesses that have already been punished, but may have positive catalysts on the horizon. The environment is definitely tough. Since the semiconductor sector has traditionally acted as a leading indicator, the stocks tend to react much harsher than what the fundamentals might project at that particular time. There is no shortage of Apple suppliers that have guided below estimates during the recent quarterly calls. For Qorvo, Apple is a big customer (unannounced, of course) and mobile business constitute almost 80% of the revenue, while the Street analysts are busy slashing expectations for iPhone unit sales and the market for smartphones is maturing fast, if not saturated already. Beside the Apple association, the market is worried about weakness in China, global economic weakness and the rise in competition. Even with a big list of concerns, the present correction seems overdone and the timing also looks right for a deeper study. The issues are mostly restricted to the mobile business and even within the mobile business, the Apple weakness story seems overplayed and the non-Apple customer expansion as well as content growth opportunity seems largely ignored, at least looking at the stock. Besides the top line growth, operational improvements and synergies should help improve margins. EPS trend QRVO. Image source: Y! Finance As the news/ rumors about iPhone 7, expected later this year, gains pace, the sentiment around the space may change. In the meantime, the estimates have corrected significantly. Even relative to other players that are believed to supply to Apple, the expectations from the business are lower and the valuation cheaper. As covered in my yesterday's note on M/A-COM ( MTSI ), a close competitor of Qorvo for the GaN solutions business, the chip industry is already under pressure, calling for a more bottom up approach to the stocks. The growth-challenged space may push players for consolidation to take care of cost structures and China may take a leading position in 5G cellular, a major growth opportunity for the industry. Qorvo, after the combination of RFMD and Triquint, is well positioned to monetize both these trends. The problems related to Apple's iPhone are relatively well documented, shipments were mostly flat last quarter and the expectations for the current quarter range around 45-50 million, significantly weaker than earlier expectations. The weakness is attributed to the China slowdown, channel inventory and the usual shift ahead of a new model. The argument for and against Apple phone's growth prospects seems to be mostly balanced with motivated investors on both sides of the argument, but for Qorvo stock, Apple's iPhone units for the quarter or two seem to be less relevant now, since the valuation suggest the fears are hardly related to the short term swing of a few million units, but more related to the long-term sustainability of Qorvo's business model. Apple is very important, but there is more to the business As for Apple's suppliers, it is easy to make an argument that the market may have exaggerated fears related to the group as a whole. The supply chain reduction may have been specific to a few models to better manage inventory, not unusual ahead of new models, and the rumors related to the next iPhone have already started to surface, be it a larger AMOLED screen or the noise cancellation headsets related to the upcoming model. As the excitement around the upcoming models builds up, the supplier group may also start to show a pulse. Secondly, the opportunity from smartphones gaining share, increasing content in those phones and the non-Apple business should support the growth. Like Skyworks and Cirrus Logic , among others, the company is widely believed to have bigger dollar content in the upcoming smartphone models from Apple and Samsung. As more and more smartphone manufacturers, including second tier manufacturers from China, adopt integrated solutions, the market share of the technological advanced players like Qorvo should grow. The next generation of RF solution from the company is also expected to ramp into production over the coming months. The IDP business is growing not just at a steady clip, but also faster than the underlying markets. The momentum should carry on with a rebound in infrastructure, with help from 4G base stations, and a focus on new growth drivers, including promising markets like IoT and high growth segments within aerospace and defense. As covered in the M/A-COM note, the company has a significant technological edge in providing GaN solutions. In the base station alone, GaN is projected to overtake LDMOS over the next few years. The company is a market leader in GaN for defense markets and has already secured a multiÂ­year win on a next generation electronic warfare system. Overall, expecting a decent double-digit growth from the non-mobile business may not be too off. Competitively, the combined entity is within a 'striking distance' of Skyworks, probably the largest RF solutions provider for the mobile market, and the talk of Qualcomm ( QCOM ) and TDK's entry into the RF space has started to capture the news flow, but considering the way design cycles work in the industry, there is little to get concerned about, at least far now and at these valuations. Compared to other semiconductor names known to be associated with Apple, the company clearly has room to improve on the margins front, even if we ignore the major differential on the GAAP numbers. The margins have already shown a significant improvement over the past few years, but there are opportunities for further improvement, especially if the top line holds up well. Even within the operating expense line, research & development expense has grown faster than the selling, general & administration, highlighting the spending opportunities of the management. The long-term goal is for a 55% gross margin. Besides the capacity changes underway, including new 6" SAW wafers and 8" BAW wafers capacities, expected synergies, almost $150 million run-rate by year-end, from the combination should also help improve the margins. * Keeping everything else steady as % of revenue. * Author's calculation. Only for academic purpose, actuals may vary significantly. Although the company has actively repurchased the stock, high free cash flow and a decent balance sheet may throw more opportunities to create value for the shareholder, even if the credit markets stay weak.
