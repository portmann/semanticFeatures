Microsoft Just Did Google A Huge Favor - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft is getting out of display ads, focusing on self-service Bing search ads. Its moves have whittled Google's desktop search share in the U.S. to 60%. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) is admitting its past online failures and dramatically cutting headcount while doing Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) a huge favor in refocusing on its Bing search engine. After spending billions to become a display ads leader over the last decade, Microsoft has dumped what is left of the business onto Verizon (VZ], in exchange for making Bing the default search engine on its AOL editorial sites. It has also given Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) a renewal on their search partnership, one that lets Yahoo take over ads on almost half that business. Microsoft's actions will reduce its own headcount because display ads and editorial content, which is also being de-emphasized, require people to service while search ads are usually sold self-service, through the engine's web site. Taken together, the moves make Bing far more competitive with Google, whose desktop search share in the U.S. is now down to 60%. You can argue this is no big deal, because Google is absolutely crushing it in mobile search , with over 90% of the market. But the value of mobile search is declining, as more-and-more traffic there is shifting to apps, where Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) is becoming increasingly dominant. What it all amounts to is an increasingly competitive online landscape, one where Google is in many ways on the defensive. Ironically, that should suit Google down to the ground. Why? Because if the market really is competitive, the government will find it more difficult to make a case that Google's algorithms, which naturally favor its own products, are anti-competitive. Tim Wu, a lawyer and former candidate for Lt. Governor of New York, who was once known as a Google defender, for instance, now says that Google is indeed treating competitors unfairly , in the wake of a study released by Yelp (NYSE: YELP ) on the subject. The study was released to get Google into more hot water with the European Union, where it just won a six-week extension to respond to anti-trust charges. But Microsoft's moves giving users and other businesses a viable alternative to Google could turn the heat down in the U.S., where a dominant market share is the antitrust test. It's just more evidence that Microsoft has learned the lesson of its own jousting with antitrust authority, namely that it's not something you want to do - it's something you want your competitors to do. This came at the cost of what had been a virtual monopoly in operating systems and software applications, but the result from here should be a healthier, more competitive player in the markets CEO Satya Nadella has chosen to focus on.
