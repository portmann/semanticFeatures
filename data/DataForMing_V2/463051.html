Microsoft Misses On GAAP Revenue, EPS; Beats On Non-GAAP After Using Lower Tax Rate; Stock Soars | Zero Hedge Over the past few quarters, starting with Warren Buffett's annual letter, and continuing with various WSJ reports that the SEC would crack down on the practice, there had been speculation that non-GAAP adjustments would be phased out. But not yet... because if it wasn't for non-GAAP addbacks, Microsoft would have missed badly on both the top and the bottom line. As the company reported moments ago, its GAAP revenue and EPS were $20.6 billion and $0.39, both far below expectations of $22.1bn and $0.58. However, when one adds back such items as Windows 10 deferrals to revenue (yes, Microsoft is not content with only fudging EPS, it did so to the top-line too, like Tesla), and "Impairment, integration and Restructuring charges" associated with the company's "performance" of its phone business, one gets non-GAAP revenue and EPS of $22.6 billion and $0.69, both comfortably beating expectations, and why not:after all courtesy of non-GAAP addbacks its actual EPS number was boosted by 77%. All thanks to the oldest accounting trick in the book. But wait that's not all, because aside from MSFT's revenue non-GAAP adjustments, the company decided to pull IBM's favorite trick, namely adjusting tax rates, Microsoft somehow ended up paying a paltry $225 million on pretax income of $3.3 billion, or about 7%.  To wit: The current quarter effective tax rate reflected a favorable mix of our income between the U.S. and foreign countries, as well as benefits associated with distributions from foreign affiliates. As such, the GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were 7% and 15%, respectively. In other words, if MSFT had used a typical corporate tax rate of 25%, EPS would have been sufficiently low to where the company may have missed consensus earnings, either GAAP or non-GAAP. For now, however, the market is delighted with this flagrant sleight of hand, and at last check, the company was trading about 4% higher in the after hours session. froze25 BullyBearish Jul 19, 2016 4:35 PM At what point do you look at a company and just call bull shit?  I mean really your either making money or your not.  Are you beating estimates that are based on GAAP or just being earnings based on whatever the hell you decide to base them on that fits what you want them to be?  Loony.

I hear the email virus stuff can burn you hard drive and give your info to fishers real quick like...microsoft likes crime. No way. Everybody plays acording to the rulles. No tax evasion no off-books accounting, no malverse practice of non GAAP adjustments. Steeley True Blue Jul 19, 2016 4:49 PM Cool, book income you'll never receive and tax it below the capital gains rate to distract attention from it - Sweet - I haven't seen anything like that since MidCom. As long as you don't try connecting ARs into the same system as APs it'll work. Freddie Steeley Jul 19, 2016 5:15 PM I keep getting upgrade to shit Windows 10.  I am really really considering moving to LINUX.  I hate MSFT and Apple "ain't" much better.  They both suck. Hey, say what you want about Bill Gates; it takes real guts to name your Fortune 500 company after the two most common adjectives women use to describe your performance in bed -Micro and soft. They're flooring it now, and they're going to floor it right up until the day the engine explodes. What else can they do? Admit they were wrong, change course? Nope. Probably they'll just start a war and try to run to Urugauy with the loot. Gawd I love the smell of cynicism...   And you gots to know that there are more than a few C-suite occupants at MSFT that read ZH on a daily basis, same as the rest.   Good... What an overbloated pig.  It used to be cheap at $27, now they basically have the same earnings and it trades at $55.  Oh the wonders of multiple expansion... Their business model is to make people pay to be spied on.  Windows 8, 8.1 and the really big one 10 SUCK.  The only decent operating systems they've had in the past twenty years has been XP and Windows 7.  From this point on it will be either OS X or Linux for me.  Dell Optiplex with a PD 3.4 & XP running it, 16 hours/day, for the past ~10 years straight and still going.   You know, one of those 'cheap Chinese junk' machines we hear about on a daily basis...   That said, I long for the days (and stability) of 10.6.8...   Releases since then really frustrating... Microsoft: It's why I use Chrome, Linux and Android. Is there any good reason to use Microsoft's bloatware and malware and become a serf, when there's so much FOSS that works? I have a Windows PC, but I only turn it on if I absolutely have to do so. I'd much rather use my Galaxy Tab A or Chromebook and now that 480GB SSD's are available, no good reason not to dual boot. gdpetti TheABaum Jul 19, 2016 4:46 PM Yes, I too, still have an old PC. I use it as a base for my monitor... perfect eye height! As an aside, Microsoft was more fun to follow with Steve "Float Like a Gorilla, Sweat Like a Pig" Ballmer at the helm... I have a small bottle of champagne tucked away. Will pop its top and gulp it down the day China announces that they no longer will load Micro$oft's NSA-ware on computers produced there for the Asian market.
