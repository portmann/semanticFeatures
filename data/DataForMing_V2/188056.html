Apple Titan? Or Titanic? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha It's reported that Apple has committed Titan to be ready for production in 2019. The company has authorized tripling current Titan management. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has been investigating various alternative products that might have sufficiently large markets to continue the growth of sales and profits. After a report on an ongoing study, it's reported Apple management has decided to commit to develop a new vehicle and to be ready for production in four years. The project/car has reportedly been named Titan. Toyota (NYSE: TM ) put the first Prius vehicles on sale in Japan in 1997. Since then, including all of the Prius varieties, they have sold 5,300,000 vehicles for approximately $115 billion. This does not include the hybrid Camry and the Toyota and Lexus SUVs. But it took them seven years before they were able to break the barrier and sell 126,000 cars in 2004 (for about $2.8 billion). And Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) delivered their sports car starting in 2008 and continued deliveries until 2012 when they introduced the Model S. There were only 2,500 sports cars delivered (at $100,000+ each) and the Model S volume was at 75,000 in June 2015 (at an average price of about $85,000). Tesla's total vehicle sales as of June 2015 were around $6.6 billion. However, they have just started to deliver their SUV and low-cost vehicles are scheduled for delivery starting next year. They also have gone into a sideline, selling battery storage systems for solar collectors. I reference a very good review of the latest variant of the Model S. So, it took seven years after introduction for Toyota to get into the billion-dollar per year club, and it also took Tesla about seven years. And we can argue that it actually took Tesla a lot longer because they copied an existing roadster design that they licensed around 2004, the AC Propulsion Tzero - shown below. But there is no argument over the fact that neither Toyota nor Tesla made any money at this for at least six or seven years. Apple committed to about four years of development work involving 1,800 people - probably at a cost approaching $2 billion per year. Also, they are investigating the use of GoMentum Station, a closed testing facility in California that can be used for testing electric and driverless cars. They also have talked with BMW possibly about using the i3 or i8 as a basis for their vehicle. Various sources have differing views about what happens in four years: Some say that Apple goes into mass production. Some say that Apple develops a demonstration vehicle that is loaded with Apple products and software that can be sold to automobile manufacturers. My impression from reading much more than is referenced here is that nobody inside of Apple seriously believes that the development work will be done in four years because they have all read what went on at Toyota and at Tesla. They also know about what happened at GM on their 1990s electric vehicle project . If Apple decides to produce the car in volume, it appears to me that it will take at least four more years after introduction before they reach profitability - two years faster than Toyota or Tesla. However, they will be competing in a new marketplace against the likes of Porsche, GM and many more new entries from deep-pocket automobile companies with much more experience in this market. Under these conditions, their market will be limited to a fraction of the available market and they will be subject to price competition that would limit their profits to the point that Titan would likely look more like Titanic. If they don't enter the market, then this looks like a very expensive experiment. 1800 heads x $1 million per head x 4 years = $7.2 billion, and that doesn't count most of the consumables or the real estate involved. It would probably be smart to make a deal with BMW or Tesla in order to get a platform that Apple can work its magic on rather than to try to develop the platform. But then Apple will be sharing the revenue rather than receiving all of it. And then where are the new products that will expand revenues and profits? Without Titan, there is nothing on the board that will get to the market soon enough with the punch needed. I don't see much room for expansion in their current markets - the iPhone is topping out, the Apple Watch needs much more development, more able competition is arising and there are a lot of loose ends that will take time to fix. Apple also has some looming problems of its own making that need addressing: The iPhone leasing program will be generating a mass of one-year-old phones that Apple will have to dispose of at bargain prices because Apple will be competing with Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) and Sprint (NYSE: S ) which also are leasing iPhones and who will be selling them on the market. The Apple Watch has sensor problems that need work. The pulse sensor doesn't work for everyone and Apple has acknowledged that fact. There is no blood pressure sensor - even though Apple originally planned one. And both of these sensors are needed and need to work well for any Watch destined for medical applications. There needs to be a way to upgrade the Watch and that needs to be publicly explained by Apple. There are too many loose ends and no vision of how Apple is going to continue to grow with satisfied customers. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
