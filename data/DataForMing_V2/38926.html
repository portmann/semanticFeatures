The Fate of The Tech Bubble Is In The Hands Of Just One Company | Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! Today, China remains central to the notion that the world is in recovery.  It is believed to be growing at 7%: not as rapid as the 9% growth we’re used to seeing, but still...

With the Nasdaq sitting at new highs having finally eclipsed the previous record of 5,048 set in March of 2000 and with consumers not-so-eagerly awaiting their chance to get in on the supposed wave of the wearables future by purchasing their very own Apple Watch, we learn that the fate of the tech bubble now rests entirely on the shoulders of Tim Cook because as FactSet notes, "blended Q1 Y/Y EPS growth for the Information Technology sector is 0.7% [but] excluding Apple, the blended earnings growth rate for the sector would fall to -5.1%.â€? And as it turns out, it's not just the tech space. Y/Y EPS growth for the entire S&P 500 is expected to come in at -2.8% â€” excluding Apple knocks more than a full percentage point off the already negative results: "The blended earnings decline for the entire S&P 500 is -2.8%. Excluding Apple, the blended earnings decline for the S&P 500 would increase to -3.9%."

Fri, 04/24/2015 - 13:57 | 6026951 zaphod I know more and more Apple people, who are switching from iPhone to Android, or who have all MacAirs but just got a Dell XPS.  There is no functional difference between iOS or Android for phones or Mac and Win8.1 for consumer PCs. Well except for the limited choice and high cost on the Apple side.  Fri, 04/24/2015 - 14:05 | 6026989 random999 Fri, 04/24/2015 - 14:35 | 6027170 Herd Redirectio... Whats funny is, Apple think their success was due to marketing (hence why change anything in the company, if the marketing is good, they can do no wrong).  They completely forget all the WORD OF MOUTH advertising Apple users USED to give.  Constantly promoting Apple products to their friends. Who in their right mind would do so today?  And which idiotic friend would believe that an iPhone, iWatch etc is worth the price? Fri, 04/24/2015 - 14:41 | 6027207 BobPaulson The stock buybacks were the first big sign of a coming iCrash. How can a company think there is more return on buying their stock than growing their business and developing new products? Fri, 04/24/2015 - 15:27 | 6027419 Karl-Hungus I confess I do love my MacBook. I have hated every new windows OS in years, and the phones are even worse. I like my iPhone too. But I won't be propping them my purchases. I actually use things until they quit working, and care nothing for having the latest and greatest. My MacBook is 3 years old and still going strong, just got an iPhone 5s about 7 months ago after my 4 year old iPhone 4 stopped working. In my personal experience they do make quality products, but the companies valuation is the pinnacle of irrational exuberance and I don't think it's going to end well for most holders of their stock. Fri, 04/24/2015 - 15:49 | 6027530 Au_Ag_CuPbCu I have a really hard time reconciling buying a watch that requires me to carry a phone that will pretty much do the same thing as the watch...sayin Fri, 04/24/2015 - 15:28 | 6027421 BullyBearish Fri, 04/24/2015 - 15:29 | 6027428 NoDebt It has nothing to do with that.  The C-suite is getting paid almost exclusively on share price of the company.  And it's not just Apple. Fri, 04/24/2015 - 15:40 | 6027485 BullyBearish OK...let's see how well the C suite can keep the price up when the OWNERS decide it's time to sell Fri, 04/24/2015 - 15:37 | 6027463 MonetaryApostate Success is only temporary and rarely long lasting, take what you can get, and then move on to something new... Innovation is what made Apple successful for a time, but if their innovation stalls or fails to deliver awesome products, down goes the legacy... (As we see is happening now) No matter what the price of the products were Herd, people still bought them regardless, and Apple had the capital to invest in more new innovations, but we shall see what comes... (Something tells me Jobs cashed out because he knew the end was near, not just for himself, but the company as well...  A Great Leader died, they can't replace him.) Also major team members left, like Guy Kawasaki, who went to Google, and so you can probably see the end drawing near...   (In the world of crony capitalism you have got to realize when the captain abandon's ship, it's time for you to as well!) Fri, 04/24/2015 - 14:49 | 6027235 Dubaibanker One of the biggest scams in the US is the corporations NOT paying most of their taxes while the individuals get thrown into jail and pay penalties for having a Swiss bank a/c! Go figure! As of 2015, Tech and digital technology being the leading contemporary and high potential growth sector, no one exemplifies tax evasion by US corporations better than Apple. Just like Apple, dozens of top US corporations either do not pay taxes or barely pay any. The stash runs into 2 trillion dollars kept overseas while the individual taxpayers bear the brunt of poor healthcare, low policing, crumbling infrastructure and higher prison costs etc. When will anyone call their senator to demand equality and grow some balls? Here's What Could Be Fixed by the Taxes on Apple's Offshored Profits Apple hoards 89% of cash overseas fearing high US tax rates On the other hand, we have CAPITALIST China where everything is run by the book and rules are equal and followed by all. Last week, Alibaba, the largest tech company and a major competitor to almost all US tech companies rolled into one, paid a solid USD 1.76 billion in taxes to the Govt of China! Alibaba Hailed as Chinaâ€™s Top Tax-Paying Internet Firm Fri, 04/24/2015 - 14:51 | 6027261 BeaverCream Yes we need more tax revenues so we can expand the welfare state and pay off Obama's hawaii vacations.  Federal taxes don't provide me with shit, so I don't care. Fri, 04/24/2015 - 14:57 | 6027287 Dubaibanker There is wastage for sure (like Obama's vacations) but we still need to pay taxes to have some form of civil society. You will get access to pensions, emergency health care, when required and a general sense of safety, hydro, decent roads and kid's education etc. You get all that like an umbrella. When it rains, you may get some drops of water on you but you wont get drenched when you need it the most. If you were the POTUS, would you not wish to have a few vacations as a perk (being the most powerful person and all that jazz!)? Fri, 04/24/2015 - 15:23 | 6027405 Dubaibanker US lost its grip in the last decade. MIC has overwhelmed the national fabric for the sake of greed and money and in order to continue to hold the grip on the slipping power. A MUST WATCH FOR EVERYONE WHO WISHES TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON FOR THE LAST 50 YEARS....I DID NOT REALISE UNTIL TODAY THAT THE BRITISH WERE RULING THE AMERICANS....FASCINATING WATCH. Fri, 04/24/2015 - 15:37 | 6027460 InjuredThales There's nothing "small government" about Somalia. Somalia is a civil war zone between multiple competing big government contenders. They all want to tell you who you can date, how old you need to be to do so, what you can eat, how many times you can pray each day, and so on, and then complete idiots like this fucktard try to tell us that this is the devolution of the libertarian ideal.  I'm sorry, but no thanks to the state I already have access to health care (and I take care of my own, and ask nothing for it). No thanks to the state I am saving enough (double no thanks) to provide for my future. I'm not having kids so fuck 'em. I don't want a fucking sense of safety - I want a sense of freedom, so fuck the state on that too.  I'm pretty sure that people would be lining up to sell me power no mater what, so fuck the state on that. Most of the subways in both New York and London were built before the state owned 'em, so, fuck the state, I'm pretty sure that roads that cost a fraction would be built without its machinations. Stay in your shithole. You deserve it. There is a bigger good to be had for all humans by living in a society being social animals. But you wont get it....because you want to live lonely and die lonely. A pity! Fri, 04/24/2015 - 16:13 | 6027633 TheAntiProgressive Yeah well society is full of people and generally people just are not that great especially if they want something and can't provide it for themselves.  Try dumping the bankster free ride role and try on a retail job for 3 months and comment again. Fri, 04/24/2015 - 16:23 | 6027676 Karl-Hungus Pull your head out of your ass. There is a huge difference between 'society' and 'government'. With all your 'muh roads' bullshit you would probably fit in  a lot better on huffpo or salon Fri, 04/24/2015 - 16:38 | 6027734 I woke up DB I've read alot of your posts and you have provided some good insight but I have to disagree with this greater good meme, it's what takes power from the people and gives it to a few.  It's readily aparent that it not working out so well so I'd like to try the opposite for a while. Fri, 04/24/2015 - 16:26 | 6027693 Ward cleaver Sir have you ever heard of a role model?  When 75% of the country is living paycheck to paycheck, do you think it wise for the POTUS to be so visible in his wasting of those same people's taxes?  It's just that he simply doesn't care. Fri, 04/24/2015 - 16:28 | 6027699 cnmcdee Taxes are horse shit - never in US history have either the democrats or republicans veteod a deficit budget - no matter what the income tax rate is they are incapable of managing their money. And it is completely irrelevant what the income tax rate goes to - governments *always* will spend every penny given them, and seek for more, consider places like Sweden and their national debt / deficit even though their taxes are approaching 75% The reality is - governments must be banned forever from borrowing or from taxing and derive their income through the issuance of currency as a percentage of gdp and encased in constitutional law with all departments, and employees payed as a percentage of of this figure.  If they need more money for a project it must be approved by the people via vote card, or it cannot be. Fri, 04/24/2015 - 15:09 | 6027343 kchrisc Fri, 04/24/2015 - 15:17 | 6027380 Dubaibanker Companies pay taxes in all other parts of the world except tax havens of which Delaware is also a part. A company is defined as a legal person in every corporate law book globally. Laws must be equal for every 'person', legal and individual alike. For example, if I sell something to you, I must pay taxes as individual on its profit, for example, could be an investment property or a boat or a diamond or whatever else. However, if I use my company to sell, why should it be any different? Income is an income. Most companies in other countries have not had the global reach that US corporations did over the last 100 years. Only China today is comparable in scale and size. When Chinese companies can pay taxes in their country or UK companies, then why US companies hesitate to pay and always use lobbyists to find a loophole? Fri, 04/24/2015 - 16:02 | 6027585 Mr Pink You failed to name one fucking thing that is paid for by federal income tax. Please enlighten me as to what we get from the feds, besides endless wars and bail outs for the TBTF. Fri, 04/24/2015 - 16:19 | 6027647 Dubaibanker All this radical polarization created by MIC started barely 10-12 years ago until when US was a prosperous nation. Now all money goes into the pockets of corporations, billionaires and a few banksters....and endless creation of new terrorists by bombing normal people's homes. None of the ZH spammers are reading you.  May be they can't and that is the problem. All you points are completely valid, only idiots are down arrowing you. Fri, 04/24/2015 - 15:45 | 6027512 Grimaldus China is run by the book huh? The book of one despotic regime after another for thousands of years, killing tens of millions of their own citizens? What is the police state doing in US for the last 10 years? How many blacks and others have been killed in the US? Is that not the same - killing own citizens? Fri, 04/24/2015 - 16:34 | 6027720 Grimaldus China killed moar of it's own citizens than the total number of death for any reason at the hands of American progressive criminal governments.

That is why she was so great as SOS cause u don't need to multi task. Fri, 04/24/2015 - 14:00 | 6026964 localsavage If they could get the cell companies and phone manufacturers to quit messing up and adding their shit to the android phones OS, Crapple would be done.

Fri, 04/24/2015 - 14:25 | 6027097 McMolotov Completely agree on all points. Windows is basically a virus masquerading as an operating system. I'm a Linux guy, but I use MacOS for work, and it's so much better than Windows, so much more "logical," there's just no comparison. Also no BSOD. I get that most people are forced to use Windows at work, but I have no idea why anyone would want to willingly inflict Windows on themselves at home when there are better alternatives. Fri, 04/24/2015 - 14:39 | 6027191 813kml Microsoft's only saving grace is that Windows was first to market and many people don't want to learn something new.  Windows and MacOS quality have been on opposite trajectories since XP, I made the switch about 10 years ago.  I will not buy another PC laptop, Mac hardware and Parallels to run Windows/Linux if needed is where it's at. Fri, 04/24/2015 - 14:50 | 6027251 MayIMommaDogFac... I @#$%^&* hate Microsoft but I have not seen a BSOD in about 10 years (3 versions of OS) and I really put my machines through the paces, both hardware and software wise. Fri, 04/24/2015 - 15:46 | 6027510 MonetaryApostate Regardless of it being a freaking NSA spy box, even linux has been proven to be nothing short of the same, and even Linus Travold said the code had become extremely over bloated & hard to manage with all of the new innovation out, so it's definitely NOT the original Linux that he originally produced.  (Far from it really)  Some distros will crash on you if they don't support your hardware (Often because it's too new) and so the tables have turned and Linux may be considered by the dumb masses as "Buggy"...  I don't care what the Linux fan bois say to the contrary, Linux is NOT perfect.  (Far from it really)  However, it's still suitable for certain task, and it's still far superior in Kernel to Windows. However, there is the hackablity of Windows Issue, which I hope they do one day put to an end, but I won't hold my breath, truly... Fri, 04/24/2015 - 17:00 | 6027792 EdSav On Windows 8.1... keeping with the theme, they really gay'd up the BSOD.. There is a frowny-face and everything.. and a cute message referring to the kernel dump as "We're collecting information about this crash and then we'll restart your computer". I have been "into" computers and technology for a very long time.. and I hate what it has become and what it seeks to be. I hope it implodes under the weight of it's hipster-douchiness. Also of note.. pretty sure that this is the first new generation of Intel processors in which their predecessors beat them in nearly every task (22nm vs 14nm).. So much that in most usage scenarios, it can result in higher power consumption via constant thermal throttling (14nm has less area to disperse heat from core). Give it a year and I'll move to Banshee, Pennsylvania and call myself Proctor.
