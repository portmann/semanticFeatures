Ford Looks Undervalued - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford is starting to get inventories of its new F-150 in line with demand. This should substantially benefit earnings going forward. Ford (NYSE: F ), the iconic US carmaker, has several good things going for it. First of all, it survived with the collapse of the American auto industry without the need for a government bailout, which is a testament to the company's management. Secondly, it makes the country's most popular vehicle. The new F-150 continues to see very strong demand and is selling well. Taking these factors into account, the stock should be trading in line with the market, but it currently sells at a significant discount to major indices. This leaves plenty of room for multiple expansion together with improving results. The days that Ford was woefully incapable of satisfying the soaring demand for the new F-150 seem to be largely behind us. Some analysts considered this lack of inventory a major issue for Ford. However, being unable to keep up with demand is certainly better than having inventory exceed demand, leading to a pricing edge among other things. With the two plants pretty much online, Ford seems like it can roughly meet demand for the country's most popular pickup truck. While it's probably not yet quite at the level of inventory it would like to see, September F-150 sales came in very strong, retail sales up a whopping 31%, while the F-series sales on the whole were up 16%. Deliveries of 69,651 were very close to the 70,000 mark analysts were hoping for. Getting the F-150 back online is of supreme importance to Ford, as the vehicle makes up a very significant portion of Ford's bottom line. Indeed, during the supply shortage as well as the retooling process, things were tough on Ford's earnings, full-year 2014 EPS down around 28% year-over-year. Things are looking up this year so far though, with a big beat in Q2 and full-year EPS consensus of around $1.70. Moreover, in the nick of time, Ford largely resolved a labor dispute that could have led to a potentially very costly plant strike in Missouri. As such, truck deliveries are likely to keep ticking up. According to a Ford spokesperson, inventories stood at around 100,000 units at the end of September, up from 92,000 at the beginning of the month. So far, the market doesn't seem particularly impressed with Ford's ramping up of the F-150 production. Over the last three months, Ford stock is down about 5.5%, roughly in line with the broader market. I feel like investors are not giving the company enough credit for its future earnings potential. Even on a TTM basis, the stock looks inexpensive, trading at around 15 times trailing earnings. Currently, analysts are looking for 2016 EPS of around $1.93. This puts the stock's 2016 P/E ratio at a jaw droppingly low 7.25. Even for full-year 2015, the ratio looks excellent at roughly 8.2. Moreover, the PEG ratio of 0.37 indicates that this growth is inexpensive. Although more expensive than GM on both a trailing and forward P/E basis, I believe that Ford will recapture much of the market share it lost in the light truck segment as inventories build up to better align with soaring demand. As such, Ford looks like the better option to me at the moment. As Ford's F-150 production ramps up to meet unabatedly strong demand, the company's outlook for the next few years looks good, if analyst estimates are anything to go by. Staving off a potentially disruptive strike at its Missouri plant, it looks like Ford will be able to keep building inventory over the next few months. The stock is moreover cheap not only on a trailing basis, but especially looking at forward multiples, which suggest the market is not giving the stock enough credit for its future earnings potential.
