The Case That Apple Is Worth At Least $200 A Share - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha After accounting for net cash, Apple's shares trade at a surprisingly large and unexplained discount to that of the average stock. This article argues that its known, ongoing businesses deserve a premium valuation equal to that of Google. The point also is argued that AAPL's free cash flow is much too high, also suggesting that the stock is greatly undervalued. Additional support for the shares comes from Apple's many areas of expertise and famous brand name, allowing it growth opportunities for many years to come. In the past year, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has turned the story around from stagnation to one of rapid, innovative product development. This dynamism has given the company stronger current growth prospects than the U.S. or global economy enjoy. With the advent of the Apple Watch and the CY Q1 results of Apple's main mega-cap competitors of Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) in the books, this article makes the case that the stars are aligning for AAPL's P/E to rise relative to the market (NYSEARCA: SPY ) and very possibly in absolute terms. Assuming this occurs combined with rising or even accelerating EPS, the stock could have very strong upside in the months and years immediately ahead. My point of view is that whether or not I agree with all his points, the lonely and self-serving investment thesis of Carl Icahn that AAPL is worth over $200 per share is reasonable and valid. Since Apple reports using GAAP, I use GAAP or as close to GAAP as I can throughout the article. This is fair to companies such as Google and most other companies, which do not have the free cash flow relative to GAAP EPS that Apple enjoys. AAPL has unusually strong risk-reward characteristics for a leading tech stock, especially given its many leadership roles in computing and telecommunications. I see Apple extending its profit leadership in tech, being relatively safe if the economy turns south and as having numerous diversified growth opportunities. AAPL is trading at $130. Using Value Line's (the oldest major independent stock analytic service) CY 2015 EPS estimate, AAPL is trading at about 14X forward GAAP EPS, which it projects at $9.35. The average stock Value Line covers is at more like 19X projected 2015 EPS. That in and of itself makes AAPL relatively undervalued. However, AAPL has something like $15/share (or more) in excess cash and marketable securities net of all debt, whereas most companies have little or no excess financial assets, including most large companies. Adjusting AAPL's share price lower for those net financial assets brings its relative P/E to about a one-third discount compared with the average Value Line stock. This makes AAPL probably the greatest bargain relative to the market that I have ever seen, adjusted for its massive size, financial strength and many other strengths. The next two sections address the questions of how cheap AAPL is to different comparators. The third section addresses whether the stock is truly attractive in the long run. I'll start with a comparison with GOOG, which has a higher P/E than either AAPL or MSFT. Both Apple and Google have cash-rich finances, brilliant CEOs, great growth records, and apparently bright futures. Both companies follow certain best practices, such as splitting the CEO and Chairman of the Board positions. Google, however, has three classes of stock that may entrench management, whereas Apple has only one class. That is a point in AAPL's favor. Now that Google has come out with Q1 earnings, its slowdown is clear. Per Value Line data, Google has grown EPS at a 54% CAGR over the past 10 years - this pace has decelerated to 20% for the past five years. It is clear from Q1's sales and earnings pace that as of now, Value Line's projected slowdown to about 12% growth through about 2017 is reasonable. This is reflected in Yahoo Finance updates on GOOG's EPS trends: The above is non-GAAP, cash-based "earnings" data, basically cash flow. It omits such material factors that Mr. Buffett fought so hard for so long to get accepted, namely that the value of stock-based compensation is a real cost that should be estimated when the grants occur. In February, Value Line projected diluted 2015 EPS of $24 for GOOG of $24. Note that Value Line in this case is not using GAAP in a strict sense, but it is mostly using GAAP by including options expense. This EPS estimate is good enough for my purposes right now. Value Line's estimate for GOOG's Q1 was $6.00. However, GAAP EPS came in at $5.20 , up only 3% over Q1 2014. In contrast, AAPL at $130 is at 14X CY projected EPS. I think that GOOG's multiple is appropriate after accounting for its massive cash hoard, which is not dissimilar as a percentage of market capitalization from AAPL's. So, now I will try to show that AAPL deserves at least a roughly similar P/E to GOOG. A. The diagram is from Geekwire: Microsoft exec: Why Apple and Google have an advantage, and how Microsoft plans to compete : The relative size of the circles indicates the number of users during the window of time that Microsoft conducted the study. The lines indicate when users of one product are more likely to use another. If one adds the Apple Watch and Apple Pay to Apple's very tight and intertwined ecosystem as shown above, two things happen. One is that the system, a veritable web, gets even stronger, just as a spider's web does. The other is that the iPhone becomes more central than it is shown in the diagram. In contrast, Google's ecosystem is less tight (though stronger than Microsoft's). And as we know, Apple's revenue per iOS user is much higher than for Android. Not only does Apple have the ecosystem lead, but its revenue and therefore profit per customer is greater than for Google. Ecosystems are more important than individual products over the long run. Products evolve, incorporate other functions, and make previous major products such as the iPod into insignificant parts of the enlarged whole - when the ecosystem is thriving dynamically. This is why I'm not overly concerned about the point that Apple is a one-product company. It is, for now, but increasingly it is a growing "spider's web" that attracts willing customers. These customers evince extraordinarily high satisfaction levels and participate financially in the ecosystem more than do Google's ecosystem customers. Apple's growing ecosystem thus leads the tech world and justifies a relatively higher P/E than companies with less tight ecosystems. This advantage of Apple is magnified when one considers the greater spending per customer it enjoys. Summarizing this sub-section, the portion of Google's business that competes more or less directly with Apple deserves a lower, not a higher multiple of earnings. Google's core advertising-related business is likely to receive a higher P/E than Apple's hardware-oriented business, but with an inferior ecosystem, it is unclear why GOOGL really deserves a higher P/E than AAPL. B. The other comparison method is more traditional: Apple is in a resurgent mode after a couple of years in which, following the momentum it had in 2011 into 2012, sales and earnings stagnated after an unbelievable decade of growth. Apple has rebounded from the many challenges it faced after Steve Jobs passed away and deserves a higher P/E appropriate to its recent sales and EPS momentum. Google, however, has seen decelerating growth in sales, profits, EPS and as discussed in the next paragraph, free cash flow. Google is finding that it must spend heavily now on fixed assets such as data centers. Using Value Line's historical and projected data for capital spending, Google has gone from spending (very roughly) 10% of sales on capital projects in 2006-12, to more like 17% last year and a similar percentage projected through 2018. This is harming the company's FCF generation. In contrast, Apple's capital spending is remaining minimal (5% or less) as a percentage of sales. Thus, AAPL's FCF is about equal to its EPS. GOOG, however, had cash flow of about $26 per share last year but about $16 in capital spending, meaning that it had about $10 in FCF. For a dominant tech stock trading near $580, it is not generating a compelling amount of FCF. GOOG is probably trading at only about a forward 2% FCF yield. Why should the FCF yields for AAPL and GOOGL be very different? Beyond the FCF and growth rate trends, other trends point in the identical pro-AAPL direction. Compare Apple Pay, and Apple's brilliant Authentec acquisition, and Apple Watch to Google's equivalent efforts. Then there's the fiasco of Google Glass. Apple is executing better than Google right now; that deserves to be reflected in a higher relative P/E for AAPL vs. GOOG. Thus even if Google's ad business is a "better" business than Apple's hardware-oriented business (I'm not certain that's correct, but for sake of argument I won't argue the point), putting all the other factors together, it's appropriate to give AAPL a similar forward P/E to GOOG. Using $9.35 for CY 2015 for AAPL (we'll know more soon) and using GOOG's 24X multiple gets AAPL right around the Icahn fair value estimate of $216. There's a second, completely different like-to-like comparison that helps validate the concept that AAPL's fair value is at least $200. 2. AAPL is dirt cheap compared to Apple's debt securities Basic financial theory posits that stocks and bonds are in some equilibrium with each other. An AAPL 10-year bond was very recently reported to trade at a 2.6% yield to maturity. In comparison, AAPL's FCF yield (the inverse of its price:FCF ratio) is 7% on a forward basis. If one excludes AAPL's net cash and marketable securities from AAPL's price, the forward FCF yield is around 8%. This is way too skewed toward the bond, especially with all the risks of owning a 10-year corporate bond yielding only 2.6%. It is rare to have shares of a financial powerhouse with strong growth ahead be so undervalued relative to its own debt. I would ask why AAPL should not trade at a 2.6% FCF yield, in line for now with the bond and similar to GOOG. After all, Apple Inc. is growing again, and given its leadership position in secular growth areas of the global economy, its FCF yield arguably might deserve to be lower than its fixed bond yield, not higher. I'm not expecting that to occur, but it's a reasonable thought. It is how tech stocks were valued relative to interest rates throughout the 1990s even before the final bubble. How much growth can we expect long term from Apple? American businesses have grown sales and profits at a 6-7% rate for decades. To assume less than that for AAPL is extremely pessimistic. I would assume a faster rate than 7% for the next decade. Perhaps later it is appropriate to be cautious and assume 6-7%, though I'm more optimistic than that, as discussed in the next section. In any case, given all the uncertainties, a 4-5% FCF yield for AAPL strikes me as not only fair but quite attractive given today's interest rates and P/Es and FCF yields seen in the stock market as a whole. A 4-5% FCF yield also points to a $200-plus fair value for AAPL. 3. Apple has numerous growth opportunities beyond its current ecosystem One of the semi-existential risks to Apple that bears point to is that it, the great disrupter, may get disrupted some day, and the deflationary pressures of consumer electronics may help lay it low. This could happen. But I think not. I think that Apple is growing to grow strongly in its current businesses. I believe that Apple has more major growth opportunities beyond its current operations in the next decade and even the next decades than any major company relative to the stock's market cap. Eventually it may be more, perhaps much more, than "just" a computer/phone company anymore. This possibility is not "in" AAPL's price. I believe there's a general under-appreciation of the numerous world-class and often world-leading capabilities Apple has developed in its long struggle to the top of the corporate heap. Apple is the best retailer in the world. Apple designs the most memorable, innovative retail stores in the world. Apple is a powerful materials company, as its new aluminum and gold alloys used in the Apple Watch show. Apple is a top-notch battery company and a great digital camera company. Apple also is a great fabless semiconductor company. More broadly, Apple is far and away the premier product designer (for a very large company) in the world, possibly the best the world has ever seen given the scale of Apple's business operations. As we see with the recent MacBook, with Apple Pay, and I believe with the Apple Watch, Apple is hitting on all cylinders in product design and attention to detail. In addition, Apple under Tim Cook may now be a brilliant corporate tactician. I suspect that its surprise alliance with IBM (NYSE: IBM ) may eventually go far beyond developing 100 apps. Maybe one of Apple's goals is to allow not just iOS but also OSX to penetrate the enterprise. Microsoft may in my view be a target of the Apple-IBM alliance. A major success in the enterprise is not in AAPL's valuation, either. All these positives meet up with a very strong, experienced management team that's highly loyal to the company. Apple will, in my view, be able to find plenty of growth areas in the knowledge-based future economy that extend beyond its current ecosystem - which itself may have massive growth ahead. Automobiles? Solar installations? Media creation, not just distribution? Expanded financial services? All these and many more possible large business opportunities have been suggested by a number of people who know Apple well. I'm confident that Apple has thought deeply about what businesses it finds most attractive not only for the next five years but for a number of years beyond that. I'll just ride along and see how their plan unfolds. There's little point in trying to outguess Apple's management. So, rather than fearing that Apple will sink like Nokia (NYSE: NOK ) or BlackBerry (NASDAQ: BBRY ), I look at the future for Apple Inc. much more optimistically. I think that the world is Apple's oyster, and that in the years and decades ahead Apple is well-positioned to grow by designing and marketing new products that build upon its many formidable strengths. No reward comes without risk, at least in investing. AAPL is the leading stock in the world and will tend to move with the market, even if it is operating successfully. Economic problems in the U.S. or China would hurt Apple's sales and profits. On a more granular level, Apple is highly dependent on the iPhone's success. The Apple Watch may not do much for the iPhone's sales, and for whatever reason, price-cutting and stronger competition than I anticipate could harm the iPhone in a major, secular fashion. While there's trading and fundamental risk in AAPL, I see it as less risky than many other places for capital, including some that traditionally are thought to be risk-free. So I agree with Value Line, which lists AAPL as a No. 1-rated stock for safety (top 6% of all stocks). Technicals and trading considerations One small knock against AAPL is that it has a low short interest relative to the float. So there's little upside from a short squeeze. That aside, the chart is constructive in all material respects. There's no meaningful overhead resistance. Can AAPL actually get to a theoretical fair value of or above $200 any time soon? I'm skeptical, but the older I get, the more patient I get. There's no rush. The dividend will increase and stay ahead of "risk-free" alternatives, and eventually relative valuations work themselves out. Trying to time when they may do so is so difficult that it's not worth the time and effort. I basically like AAPL's technical situation and think that the stock is well-positioned to move toward fair value at a rate that will make shareholders happy. Looking at AAPL from the standpoint of an observer of the tech scene for half a century, I disagree with Mr. Market on AAPL. Why might the market be inefficient in valuing AAPL? Who knows? It appears strange. This simply looks like a truly rare opportunity to buy a great company at a price that would be attractive in almost any market environment. In this era of richly-valued stocks and bonds, I like this stock that much more. This valuation discount offers additional upside potential if Apple succeeds in the quarters and years ahead as my base case suggests, and also provides some downside projection if business trends are disappointing.
