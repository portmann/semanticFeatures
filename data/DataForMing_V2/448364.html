AgroFresh: Better Weather Should Drive Stock Meaningfully Higher - AgroFresh Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:AGFS) | Seeking Alpha Shares of AgroFresh were pummelled last fall when the company missed numbers owing to a weak North American Apple harvest. Preliminary Apple forecasts released this week suggest 8% y/y crop growth this year. Better apple production, coupled with the growth of Harvista and RipeLock should position AGFS to achieve the upper end of guidance. With shares largely unloved and/or unnoticed, we believe risk/reward is attractive in light of the weather forecast. Potential catalysts include continued strong weather/crop forecasts, the naming of a new CEO, and the resumption, in earnest of the company's buyback. Since AgroFresh's (NASDAQ: AGFS ) merger with Boulevard Capital Acquisition (a former SPAC) it's been a bumpy ride. While shares went as high as $13 - and insiders were buying in late August/early September at prices over $10. Things deteriorated markedly when the company reported 3Q results with a bad apple harvest to blame (down ~20% y/y in North America) - and on the call management did not provide full year guidance, despite just 45 days remaining in the year. The stock traded to $4.50. Two days later the company provided guidance - about 13% below full year original full year expected EBITDA, not great, but far from the disaster implied by the earnings conference call - which was followed by 6 additional insider buys, and shares recovered to almost $7. The bumpy ride continued in early 2016 with the exit/termination of both the company's CEO and its President in early March. We believe it was a cultural mismatch, with AgroFresh's senior leadership coming from Dow (NYSE: DOW ), a company with a large firm culture, when the company, in fact, needed a much more entrepreneurial leader. In the interim, there are co-CEOs - who are exceptionally qualified to temporarily head the business - Dr. Nance Dicciani running the operations, and Stephen Trevor, running M&A. Management has indicated that it will have a new CEO named by it's 2Q conference call. We believe this is an exceptionally engaged management team and Board. According to the proxy statement, the Board met 18 times last year. If anyone is aware of a Board that met more frequently, we'd be interested to know. More recently, Avenue Capital founder (the sponsor of the SPAC), and billionaire Marc Lasry, joined the Board of Directors. Several weeks ago SA contributor Leveraged Loner wrote an excellent update on AgroFresh , with significant valuation work. It's a worthwhile read, lays out extensive financial projections, and provides detailed comps. It suggests a fair value of AgroFresh in excess of $10 - about 100% upside to yesterday's close of $5.31. We're not going to rehash the details, but we agree with the conclusion Instead, we're going to talk about the weather. This week, at the premier Apple Cooperative Meeting in Syracuse , initial production forecasts were provided for US apple production. Expectations are for production to be up 8% y/y and exceed the 5 year average by 3%. In addition, AgroFresh management has indicated that Harvista (a product which keeps apples ripe while on trees) should double this year, while Ripe-Lock, which keeps bananas ripe longer, continues to make progress. Given the US is the dominant and most important market for AgroFresh, these factors suggest that barring a sharp deterioration in weather/harvest forecasts, the company should be well positioned to achieve the mid-to-high-end of the 5-12% revenue growth projected for 2016. We suspect that if the company achieves the high-end for revenue growth, it will also likely achieve the high-end of EBITDA guidance of $90-$100 million. Importantly, Harvista and RipeLock should be ongoing growth engines for AgroFresh, with management guiding that they should account for $65 million, or >25% of company revenue within 5 years. While neither gained meaningful traction in 2015, we believe both are trending ahead of plan in 2016. The company also announced on its 1Q conference call a new opportunity with its core 1-MCP product (used in SmartFresh for apples). While they did not specify the fruit/opportunity, management commented to us, that we wouldn't have announced it "if it were for pomegranates." For a company such as AgroFresh, with a meaningful debt load, hitting the high-end of EBITDA, and presumably free cash flow guidance, in this case $40M+, can have a disproportionate effect on the equity. Just as last year's miss drove shares dramatically lower, we believe a change in weather can quickly drive a change in sentiment and stock price. Upcoming catalysts - We expect shares to be driven higher over the next 60 days. Specifically we anticipate: The naming/hiring of a new CEO prior to the 2Q earnings conference call. A reiteration of full year guidance, given preliminary North American harvest data (Northern Hemisphere is 80-90% of EBITDA). Confidence regarding the traction/momentum of Harvista and RipeLock. Clarity on/announcement of the new 1-MCP product. With 9 days of short interest and a low capital intensity stock (98% cash conversion and 1% of revs on cap-ex) at 7x EV/EBITDA, we think that if things go right, there's substantial upside to shares. Sometimes there are structural issues and sometimes it's just the weather - in this case we think the sell-off was almost entirely weather related, precisely the time we want to be buyers.
