To What Extent Will iPhone Shipments Grow Next Year? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha I anticipate 20% growth in iPhone 6s shipments when based on historical trends. Apple has retained the vast majority of its customers over the years, so arguing over refresh driven demand seems kind of redundant. To drive shipment growth Apple will need to increase the size of its installed base. Apple has done this consistently over the past five years. I think demand will be driven by low- to high-end device switchers, which is due to broader changes in macro related factors and the timing of carrier additions. On Monday, Seeking Alpha contributor Paulo Santos speculated over Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) upcoming iPhone 6s release, and for the most part, I disagree with the author's stance. There's the theory out there, sometimes repeated in Apple article comments, that the iPhone 6s will be favored by the iPhone 5s bump. This is based on iPhone 5s users coming off contract and finally being able to upgrade to the iPhone 6s. That being the case, Paulo's comments on the iPhone 6s stick out to me, because he believes that demand was more or less exhausted after the implementation of a larger screen. Sure, it's one factor to the puzzle, but not the most meaningful one currently. The smartphone refresh cycle has maintained its course due to the rapid depreciation of mobile components and the ongoing commitment to two-year mobile contracts. Sure, some have opted out of two-year contracts, but the vast majority of smartphone plans are sold on a two-year contract. Therefore, a refresh every two-years seems more or less intact. What gained Apple mobile subscribers was emerging market growth, and market share additions. The move to high-end devices has crippled demand for commodity phones, and as such, Apple is positioned for success despite the looming skepticism of the bears. I have constructed a brief model that captures the growth in iPhone units over the years. The cumulative installed base has grown, and at a pretty steady pace. Some years, the growth isn't as robust like in the case of 2013 and 2014. However, in 2015, the iPhone posted up some pretty spectacular numbers. The argument stems on whether that was due to refresh, or because of stronger demand in general. When averaging a two-year refresh, we can easily operate under the assumption that some years will perform better than others. In the case of the iPhone 5, the installed base grew by a decent number of units, however, the next year, the growth stalled out. Apple inked a deal with China Mobile (NYSE: CHL ) in Q1 of 2014, and NTT Docomo in Q4 of 2013. Apple's fiscal year 2014 wasn't impacted by the addition of these carriers until 2015. Apple had yet to build out a large retail footprint in China, and Japan didn't generate meaningful growth up until 2015. The launch of a new device created organic demand, while retaining the preexisting subscriber base. Apple continued to enjoy low turnover throughout the five-year period, so making an argument over whether the preexisting base will upgrade is kind of redundant. The loss of the preexisting base will determine whether Apple will report a decline in growth, but depending on a smaller base of iPhone owners to generate more demand for newer devices is illogical. The preexisting base will grow, and older subscribers will transition to a new iPhone upon the expiration of their mobile contract. Therefore, to grow the installed base, Apple has to generate more demand, and the growth seems to be coming from low-end to high-end device conversions, and growth in emerging markets. This trend isn't likely to change by much, which is why I forecast 267 million units in 2016. I anticipate growth in units at around 21% year over year due to continuous growth of the entire installed base inclusive of upgrades from iPhone 5 and 5s users. I think Apple could surprise investors by increasing storage capacity for the base model. This will encourage iPhone upgrades, and will boost adoption of more iPhones in this upcoming cycle. This change in strategy doesn't damage gross margins much, as the memory density and economics of flash storage have improved considerably due to the adoption of V-NAND, or 3D NAND. The point? Apple's upcoming refresh comes with more base memory, which could prove to be a selling point in the upcoming cycle. Furthermore, the iPhone 6s will come with a beefier CPU and GPU and will include iOS 9. The device will be smoother, which is kind of ironic, because that doesn't even sound logical anymore. That being the case, if the last cycle was all about the bigger screen real estate, the next cycle will be driven by performance and higher base storage. That's not much to work with, but when you're dealing with users who are transitioning away from low-end Android devices just about any high-end phone looks like a Maserati in comparison. Apple just happens to package luxury into its devices whereas everyone else cannot. The differentiation of Apple's ecosystems and the strong support for Apple's hardware juxtapositions the high-end from the low-end. While low-end commodity phone makers get crushed, the high margin, high value smartphone OEMs will continue to corner more and more of the smartphone profit pie. The stock continues to pull back, but in comparison to the broader stock market it has outperformed. Expectations were high going into Q3 earnings; however, the company wasn't able to deliver full-year outlook that was compelling enough to attract more investors. The broader market environment has been weak, and upon a more normal return to capital inflows, I anticipate fundamentally sound stocks like Apple to outperform in comparison to peers and the broader market. Assuming Apple is able to generate 20% revenue growth in the next fiscal year, the stock is a freaking bargain at these levels. Admittedly, everyone has postulated the same argument using a variety of different metrics. However, my argument directly counters the prevailing opinion of analysts. I highly doubt the consensus figures for revenue growth of 5% in FY 2016 are accurate. Investors could be over-estimating the accuracy of the consensus view at the present time.
