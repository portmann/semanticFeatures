(The Sports XChange) - For the third time in four years, the Washington Capitals and New York Rangers will require a Game Seven to decide who moves on in the playoffs after the Rangers beat the Caps 4-3 on Sunday. Chris Kreider scored twice at the Verizon Center, and Rick Nash and Dan Boyle tallied in the third period, as the Rangers staved off elimination for a second straight game. With the Eastern Conference semi-final series now tied at 3-3, the winner-take-all Game Seven will be played at Madison Square Garden in New York on Wednesday. The teams also needed Game Sevens in 2012 and 2013, with the Rangers coming out on top both times. Kreider scored twice in the first period before Jason Chimera pulled one back for Washington in the second. The Rangers looked to have put the game out of reach in the third when Nash and Boyle game them a 4-1 lead but the Capitals fought back. Washington rookie Evgeny Kuznetsov scored his fifth goal of the playoffs at 7:40 and winger Joel Ward made it 4-3 less than two minutes later to set up a thrilling finale. Rangers netminder Henrik Lundqvist withstood a barrage of shots in the final nine minutes, his biggest stop on Washington captain Alex Ovechkin, who has failed to score in fourth straight games in the series. The Capitals had a two-minute power play in the final three minutes after Rangers winger James Sheppard took a delay of game penalty for flipping the puck out of play.
