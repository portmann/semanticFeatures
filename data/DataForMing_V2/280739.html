It's A Trap! - Bezek's Daily Briefing | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I am/we are short EWZ. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. Markets careen lower out of the gate. China, Middle East, Fed all weigh on market to start the year. For anyone still in a holiday daze, Monday was a nice bucket of ice water to welcome them to 2016. Stocks got smashed, adding to last Thursday's selloff. The Dow (NYSEARCA: DIA ) dropped 277 and the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA: SPY ) was down more than 31 points. And both were down way more; the Dow was off almost 500 at one point before a sizable rally in the last half hour took stocks to their highest levels of the day. There were at least three things weighing heavily on the market. First up, bad economic news from China (NYSEARCA: FXI ) (NYSEARCA: ASHR ). This triggered a stunning selloff, with their market getting shredded for a 7% loss in the opening moments of trading before government authorities halted trading for the rest of the day. As anyone who has read up on the history of market panics knows, trading halts usually exacerbate the problem rather than relieving tension. Anyone remember the US government banning short sales of financial stocks (NYSEARCA: XLF ) in 2008? If you do, you'd remember that the XLF plunged 50% in the following two months following the move to rid maligned short sellers from the market. Oops. Long story short, government manipulation of markets is of limited utility, if not outright counterproductive. Still, China's problems aren't exactly new. They drove much of last year's selling in commodities and emerging markets. Without new information showing a fresh decline in the Chinese economy, I doubt these Chinese problems will be a catalyst for a great rush of selling. Of more concern are rising tensions in the Middle East. Over the weekend, tensions between regional powers Saudi Arabia and Iran mounted. Saudi Arabia made some political executions, Iranians responded by torching the Saudi embassy, and then the countries broke diplomatic ties. Is this a big story? Hard to say. There's an argument to be made that this is some sort of kabuki theater to try to boost the price of oil. Oil (NYSEARCA: USO ) in fact spiked by as much as 3% Sunday evening before giving back the gains Monday as the global equity rout intensified. On the other hand, if Saudi Arabia and Iran are really in danger of coming to blows, things could get ugly quickly. Syria and Iraq are already war zones. Having two other big regional states falling into increasing instability would be the last thing the area needs. To the average western investor, there shouldn't be a huge impact. It's nearly impossible to invest in the Middle East, it's not a huge profit center for most multinationals, and even a spike in oil wouldn't be a terrible thing, given the current low price. Still, any conflict that had wider implications, such as potentially dragging Russia into the fray, could lead to another round of jitters. As one might expect, gold (NYSEARCA: GLD ) finally got a bounce on the news. Gold has been totally out of favor recently, with the only real question being if it will trade under $1,000/oz soon. Still, at least for one day, it did its job as a geopolitical hedge, rallying $15/oz in an otherwise nearly bidless market. The third reason for Monday's selloff was yet more inopportune Fed comments. The Fed already made their ill-advised December rate hike. The market was able to withstand that, and so the Fed apparently feels it should keep up the pressure. Fed member John Williams repeated his desire for 3 to 5 hikes this year on Monday, despite the sharply weakening economic outlook. On the same day, the Atlanta Fed again downgraded Q4 GDP growth estimates, now to a measly 0.7%. That's down from 1.3% just two weeks ago, and that itself was a sharp drop from the previous 2%+ estimates. Let's put this clearly. The US economy is rapidly decelerating. The global economic crisis is coming home to roost, and the Fed is trying to execute a massive series of rate hikes into it. What are they thinking? Normally, a Central Bank would be on an easing trajectory when their home economy is growing at less than 1%, inflation is under target, and the world economy is in a funk. But no, this Fed wants to take dramatic steps to freeze up credit markets. Parallels to the 1930s are uncanny. I'll grant the Fed their one hike they "had" to make to protect their alleged credibility. But this current policy is blatantly counterproductive. The Fed needs to stop posturing this way immediately. They will cause great harm with their current na√Øve outlook. There have been 11 articles about Disney (NYSE: DIS ) here at Seeking Alpha since the Star Wars movie dropped to great acclaim and record breaking box office receipts last month. Almost all of these have been very bullish, touting the potential positive impact of Star Wars for the company. What happened? This was a classic buy the rumor sell the news event. Smart speculators buy ahead of a potential big event, thinking that as media hype and buzz builds, more and more less informed people will want to get involved. That was the mid-month rally in this case which ended abruptly on the 16th as the movie released. By the time CNBC shows up and starts filming the lines for the premiere, the stock-buying is done. All the late money is into the stock, and even the best box office gross of all time couldn't move the stock an inch higher. In fact, Disney has been one of the worst performing stocks in the market over the past two weeks. Star Wars simply wasn't a significant event. Disney has a near $200 billion market cap, you really think $1 billion of ticket sales (even if they got a 100% margin on them) is going to move the needle? Even including toys and the video game, it's a rounding error. The real lesson of Star Wars is that you can't win in the stock market with first order thinking. First order thinking is the sort of thing you see on CNBC. Some event is happening now, so we should buy stock to take advantage. But by the time the event is so obvious as to be on TV, forward thinkers have already positioned to take advantage. The stock market may not be efficient, but it isn't wildly inefficient either. Trust me, there were plenty of people thinking about the impact of Star Wars for months, it wasn't like the day it came out was time to say: Gee, there's a new movie out, I bet it will be a hit. By then, it's far too late. To make money in the markets, you need an opinion different from or ahead of the market. Before trading the news, ask yourself two questions. Will this event make a material impact on the company? And: Do I know something the market doesn't? In the case of Star Wars and Disney, the answers were no and no. As for Disney, the stock is still a short or at best avoid. At the risk of making enemies, let me be frank. There's little logical defense of shares above 100. An alarmingly high number of bull cases of this company are based on emotional arguments born out of how much people like Disney products. That's fine, but it's not an investment rationale. If Disney were selling packaged foods or toilet paper, would you want to pay 21x earnings for it while its main profit center (ESPN) is under heavy fire? I certainly wouldn't. Disney hadn't ended a year with a PE ratio this high since 2003. This is irrational exuberance for a business entering troubled waters. And the dividend is so low as to provide hardly any buffer if shares correct dramatically. Stay far away. People have been asking me when I'd cover my Brazil (NYSEARCA: EWZ ) short. I've been saying sub-20 was a slam dunk for 2016 and I'd reevaluate there. Well, it took all of one day to break 20, congratulations Brazil, you're still the weakest emerging market link. And it's still no buy here. Since you're probably tired of hearing me say it, I'll outsource my writing on the subject to The Economist for this week:
