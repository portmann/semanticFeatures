FBI offers hacking help to law enforcement - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apr  3 2016, 11:03 ET | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor After successfully cracking the San Bernardino shooter's iPhone last week, the FBI has assured law enforcement across the U.S. that it will help unlock mobile devices involved in investigations when it is allowed by law and policy. But according to Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) engineers, the agency's method for breaking into the locked iPhone 5c is unlikely to stay secret for long. Once it is exposed, the company should be able to plug the encryption hole, comforting iPhone users worried that losing physical possession of their devices will leave them vulnerable to hackers. Law enforcement should hurry up and unlock all these phones pronto, because soon Apple will patch the security exploit and we will be back at square one. Yep. Hacking vs security will always be a back and forth game. The fact that the FBI seems to be pounding their chest on this one confirms that Apple products remain the most difficult devices out there to crack.  The entire incident makes me feel better about using Apple products. I hope they require a warrant. If I offered this service would it be legal, or FBI would put me in jail? I wish the FBI could crack into Apple's finances and increase the Dividend Yield to at least 3% or it could be at least 5 more years before it gets there if Shareholders are waiting for Management to do it. Never a Cop around, when you need one! Clearly the terrorism excuse was the thin edge of the wedge. Shades of NSA encroachment on individual privacy. Welcome to the land of the free and the home of the bravado (Trump style). By the way, for those of you interested, a short movie describing the FBI's approach to rooting out terrorism, might prove educational and might suggest why silicon valley mistrusts them: It's the wars and terrorism that brought things like the Patriot Act into being. Trump's foreign policy would do a great deal to reduce foreign conflict. Some love him for his solution to anchor babies. Some love him for speaking out against the bad trade deals. Some love him for his foreign policy. Ann Coulter tries to say immigration is everything. Justin Raimondo tries to say foreign policy is everything. The NYT recently praised Trump on trade. Well, the truth is: all 3 are sources of Trump's support. Leave it to the Israelis to figure it out... look what they did to the Iranian nukular program,  instead of bombing them, they just send you an email to blow yourself up. The fellows in our government have never been able to keep a secret for very long whether it is on how to build a nuclear warhead or presently in safeguarding our privacy or personal security. Oh yeah? Where are Romney's taxes or Clinton's sex tapes. Think twice. There are LOTS of secrets you will never know. And how do you build a nuke? Just ask'n. I am an electrical engineer and told my wife that this thing between the FBI and Apple  was theater.  Sure it would be easier if Apple helped but any phone that you know the components can be jail breaker by loading your own bootloader and OS. You the brute force the encryption. It is not simple but doable. I do believe that hacking is illegal. I like this guy "ubeenfranked", he doesn't just condone this action but wants them to hurry up and do away with the security on all phones before they can change anything.....is this person an AMERICAN,,,,or just a plain stupid idiot?????????? How many tax dollars did the FBI spend to unlock the one phone? Maybe the FBI should charge a fee for unlocking any future phones to make up for how much they spent on the contract with Cellebrite. I may have missed something that was released but it seemed like by saying they have cracked the phone, they could drop the case without embarrassment due to their lack of merit on the case. There has still been no proof that the phone has been cracked. Even if it has been cracked, the encryption for phones released later can change thus making the original method obsolete. It is just a game of cat and mouse.
