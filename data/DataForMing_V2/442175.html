Apple Pulling The Plug On The Only Computer Monitor It Makes â€“ Consumerist Whoops! It looks like portions of our site are being blocked!

Thunderbolt Display apple Mac computer monitors technology It looks like Apple is done with the standalone monitor business: the company confirmed it won’t make any more Thunderbolt Displays, so once the existing inventory is sold, that’s all there is. The Thunderbolt Display, while popular, hasnâ€™t been updated in the five years it’s existed as Apple’s one and only monitor. Itâ€™s still for sale for $999 in the Apple store — a price that will stay steady until the end — while supplies last, the company says. “Weâ€™re discontinuing the Apple Thunderbolt Display,â€? a company spokesperson confirmed in a statement making the rounds today. â€œIt will be available through Apple.com, Appleâ€™s retail stores, and Apple Authorized Resellers while supplies last. There are a number of great third-party options available for Mac users.” Those other options wonâ€™t be sold by Apple, however, so if you want a monitor for your Mac, you’re on your own. And as for whether or not Apple will be coming out with something to replace the Thunderbolt, thatâ€™s still unclear.
