Intel Or TSMC? Which Deserves Your Investment Dollar? - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel and TSMC have close to the same market cap, but have radically different sales and trajectories. Intel is losing badly in the growing mobile market, while TSMC expansion with it, will allow a larger Capex than Intel in 2015. One of the more alarming phenomenon I have come across while posting and writing on Seeking Alpha is the attitude of Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) investors toward their company. It concerns me that they, at least those that comment and write, are generally non-critical to an alarming degree. It's easy to understand, because the company makes money, and has been for quite some time, but doubts are healthy, particularly with a company that is not growing in a market that is. Intel's recent fall, where the company warned that desktop PC sales did not meet expectations, is just another weak sign in the market Intel is addicted to. Yet, for Intel, failure abounds everywhere else they try. Similarly, many consider AMD (NASDAQ: AMD ) Intel's main competitor, but in this article, I am going to present a different company that better reflects the issues Intel faces, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM ), hereafter referred to as TSMC. The two are at the crossroads, where once Intel was far ascendant. While Intel's failures have sapped its strength, the continued growth of the mobile market has contributed to the burgeoning power of TSMC, so much so that TSMC will invest more in Capex than Intel in 2015. Interestingly, these opposing trajectories currently leave the market cap of both companies similar, $146 Billion for Intel, $128 Billion for TSMC, as of this writing. The P/E favors Intel slightly at 13.35 compared to 17.8 for TSMC. Where Intel still enjoys a very favorable edge is Price/Sales, which is 2.8 for Intel, and 5.9 for TSMC. I have always considered P/S more meaningful than P/E because it varies much less from quarter to quarter, but everyone has their own ideas on that. Although Intel enjoys a substantial P/S advantage, the trajectories of the companies clearly favor TSMC. Intel seems incapable of growth, having failed to profitably enter newer growth markets; TSMC has clearly benefited from the same market changes that have marginalized Intel. Although indirectly, TSMC and Intel are competitors, and when one wins, it narrows the opportunities for the other. Of course Intel's use of TSMC for the initial SoFIA products contradicts this. However, this is mainly because of Intel's slow development speed, which still has not moved the technologies they purchased from Infineon onto their own fabs. Clearly, this is the exception, and is only a short term situation. So, which of these two will win? TSMC has a far better chance of defeating Intel, mainly because they are part of a coalition of companies that dwarf Intel in resources, and are currently doing far better. They have Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) , ARM (NASDAQ: ARMH ) , NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA ), etc... all working with them, although not always entirely. Both Apple and Qualcomm have completely dominated Intel in the phone and tablet market, leaving Intel to look for the scraps that fall off the table. Without the processor development skill of these companies, Intel was forced to pay tablet makers to use their CPUs, while completely missing the phone market. The latter will change with SoFIA entering the low-end phone market in 2015, however. Intel so far has not seen much success in the IoT market, while ARM vendors currently do quite well. That's the strength of TSMC, they have partners, and if they have success, TSMC often does too. But not always. Intel, although certainly lacking the resources of the enormous coalition building processors at TSMC, has very important advantages. While TSMC profits from chips sold by its partners, this is not nearly as significant as the profit Intel makes when it does, presuming they are not subsidizing the chips. Also, Intel has a more stable market than TSMC, which could lose important contracts to competitors like Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) , and its "accessory", Global Foundries. We'll go into the relative strengths and weaknesses of each company, starting with Intel. Intel still owns the PC market, with AMD being hopelessly outclassed in the higher-end of the market. Although shrinking, it should remain large for the foreseeable future, and be a constant source of profits for Intel while it attempts to succeed in other, growing markets. Also, Intel has more experience in FinFets, and is on their second node, whereas both Samsung and TSMC are still very early in the learning curve. One most note, though, that even while using FinFets against planar products, Intel has not been successful in the mobile market, and the relative situation in fabrication technology is less favorable in 2015, and will be particularly so in 2016 as competitors ramp their FinFets. Although Intel has also shown interest of using its fabs for other companies, and this could eventually provide substantial revenue for Intel, they are currently non-competitive with TSMC and Samsung in terms of tools, costs, and accessibility. By contrast, TSMC does not have anything approaching the security of selling their own processors into a well-established market. Apple is an enormous source of revenue for TSMC currently, but this is no way guarantees future revenue, as Apple has used Samsung in the past. Many believe Apple was behind the licensing of Samsung's 14nm FinFet technology to Global Foundries; supply of 14nm wafers from Samsung alone may not be sufficient in 2015 for Apple's A9, and their own Exynos processors. If true, this would strongly imply at least some of Apples next generation production will be at Samsung. In fact, Samsung beat TSMC to FinFets, and even TSMC's CEO, Morris Chang, accepted that Samsung will outship TSMC in FinFets this year, while believing TSMC will ship more in 2016, when the market for FinFets is considerably larger. Although the big news lately was a report indicating TSMC will be getting 70% of Apple's next generation A9 processor revenue, this seems dubious. Given the timing of the release of Apple's products, and that it generally takes roughly 18 months, considering both design time and production time, it seems much more likely Samsung/GloFo will be the vendor for the A9 parts. Considering Global Foundries is currently installing capacity for FinFets, but will have no business from AMD in 2015, it seems even more likely TSMC will not see Apple's A9 business. In fact, this report , which seems more sensible to me given the time constraints, indicates the same. The link also indicates Apple leaving x86 for ARM on their Macs, which I consider inevitable. Although Morris Chang derisively referred to Global Foundries as Samsung's "accessory", it is dangerous to dismiss it so frivolously. Because of its relationship with AMD, and IBM, GloFo is not without assets. In the past, AMD had used TSMC extensively for video cards, and also some of their lower end APUs. While AMD has not closed the door on TSMC, and may use them in the future, the relationship has clearly been diminished, as AMD has moved virtually all its production to Global Foundries. One point that is rarely brought up is IBM's fabrication technology, and Global Foundries. IBM has very advanced processes, and is continuing to develop it despite the sale of all but one of their fabrication (which is kept for development purposes) facilities. IBM's 14nm FD-SOI FinFet seems extremely well suited for their server parts, which could provide a useful process for other companies wishing to develop CPUs in this segment. Qualcomm, which is currently using TSMC's 20nm planar technology, is believed to be using Samsung's FinFets for its next node, at least initially. NVIDIA has complained bitterly in the past about the cost of 20nm planar at TSMC, although it appears the density and price have improved dramatically since then. Even so, although likely, it is not certain NVIDIA will choose TSMC. It is not only in the latest nodes where TSMC has some exposure. Although Intel's management likes to talk about Moore's Law and how they are committed to it, it died many years ago, and now just means an advancement in fabrication processes, regardless of timeframe. However, even with the lengthening timespans, the benefits moving from node to node do not approach those of a decade ago. As such, older nodes, and in particular 28nm planar, will likely live a very long time, perhaps indefinitely. Recently, it was announced that TSMC's February sales were significantly down month to month. It's difficult to consider this anything but fluff, as year to year sales were significantly up, and February not only has fewer days than January, it also has more holidays in Taiwan. More than this, due to the lead time involved in production, short term blips are not meaningful. Even so, there clearly there are risks for TSMC. They have partners, but these partners are free to choose other foundries, and the Samsung/GloFo/IBM partnership is formidable. Intel is trying to get into the foundry business, but they are hopelessly behind real foundries in many parameters, and it's not clear if their choices in process are as well targeted as TSMC's in SoCs. After all, Intel's priority is always their mainstream "Core" processors. On a positive note, MediaTek is also rumored to be choosing TSMC over Samsung. Overall, TSMC is predicting 15% growth in 2015, and they have pretty good visibility due to the lead time involved in these partnerships. Much of it no doubt will continue to be 20nm Apple parts, and some will probably be the continued success of their 28nm processes. Which brings us to another strength of the company. Many consider the newest processes as all that's important, but this not nearly the case for TSMC. They continue to get solid revenue from processes as high as 180nm. More than that, these older processes are improved upon when TSMC learns from newer processes. Not every business needs the newest technology, so TSMC continues to provide and improve useful older technology, and it represents a significant revenue stream. However, Samsung has demonstrated interest in using FD-SOI on 28nm, which in Q4 generated 30% of TSMC's revenue, and likely will remain an important revenue node. Using FD-SOI would give very good performance, exceeding even 20nm planar on bulk silicon, while costing essentially the same as 28nm bulk silicon. This could be very attractive, as it is much easier for companies to design on, compared to later nodes, and the costs for taping out are significantly lower than on FinFets, close to an order of magnitude. This makes it particularly attractive to that are not large enough to afford smaller nodes. We now know that there are over 100 tapeouts for TSMC's 16FF+ process, and we also know their growth in Capex indicates the pipeline will remain strong in 2015, with more significant growth in 2016 when the 16FF+ process ramps, and perhaps Apple chooses it for their A10 line of processors. In fact, one of TSMC's advantages over Samsung is, they are a pure-play foundry and do not compete with their customers. This has to make them more attractive to Apple, which not only competes with Samsung, but also has a history of lawsuits against the company. Coupled with the strong performance and yields for the 16FF+ line, and it's very likely TSMC will enjoy significant design wins in 2016. When looking at both companies, their situations are radically different. One was very powerful, but constant failure, and the move to mobile has rendered it somewhat impotent and irrelevant outside of a shrinking legacy market. This market seems very secure, and is very profitable, however. There is the risk of a resurgent AMD, with its introduction of Zen is 2016, which could fundamentally alter Intel's profits in this market. Intel has no chance of winning the mainstream tablet market, as they have poor technology that has not been competitive, and has become less competitive with time. The fast growing low-end phone market is a real opportunity for Intel, but the general incompetence of management has to temper hopes there. IoT offers perhaps the best chance for Intel, but again, the lethargy and consistent failure of Intel management make any success seem difficult to predict. That is the risk for Intel. Victories mean more, but they seem unattainable for the degenerate giant. But, history tells us, that Intel can turn things around quickly, as they did in 2006. TSMC is far from perfect, having lost the race to FinFets with Samsung, and likely the next iPhone sales with it. The company also competes with Samsung very directly, as well its current partner, Global Foundries. The Price/Sales is less than half Intel's, which even with their current trajectory will take time to overcome. However, there is no doubt they are growing with the mobile market, even if it is uneven at times, and this growth gives the company more resources to expand further, to the extent its CapEx will exceed Intel's in 2015. 2016 should be a breakout year, as their advanced 16FF+ process ramps up, and designs move into production, albeit with the fewer 20nm Apple processor shipments. Although the FinFets and the continuing growth of mobile ARM processors should fuel most of the growth, it's also important to remember the older process nodes for TSMC make a solid profit, and are a stable business that shows no sign of waning. Anything can happen in technology, and no one can say for sure Intel will continue on the path of failure, especially with some promising products, like SoFIA and Quark. However, TSMC's path to success seems so much more likely. Its partners show no signs of letting up, and continue to release exciting technologies, that go into products that people want. The company's IP, both with older nodes, and the new 16FF+ node, looks very strong, and shows promise as the company appears to be leading in EUV development, and is aggressively moving to their 10nm node. For the first time, TSMC's CapEx will exceed Intel's in 2015, showing just how dramatically the company has grown. For this reason, I believe TSMC will soon surpass Intel in market cap and be a stronger investment as we move into the latter part of the decade. Intel's management leaves me cold, as does their inability to make compelling technology in the tablet and phone market. Hope remains for Intel, but I'll take substantial Apple contracts over vague notions of hope. Either way, it will be interesting to see how the mobile revolution reassembles the players, and where they sit when it stabilizes. Source: Intel Or TSMC? Which Deserves Your Investment Dollar?
