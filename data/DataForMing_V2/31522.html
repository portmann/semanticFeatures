Intel Train Is Leaving The Station - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha EPS is expected to increase during 2015 to an annual average rate of over $2.50 per year. The quarterly movement in EPS will be dramatic. 5 out of 11 top analysts have recently set Intel stock price targets above $40, as high as $48. Historically, as Intel EPS rises, its PE ratio also rises. With an EPS of $2.50 and corresponding PE ratio of 17, Intel stock would reach $42.50 per share by the end of 2015. A likely bump in EPS caused by the sales of Skylake with Windows 10 would increase Intel to north of $45 by December 2015, possibly much higher. With Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) recent earnings report and the Shenzhen Intel Developer Forum , the near-term future for INTC (2015) is becoming clearer. A painfully slow first part of 2015 will blossom into full bloom going into the back-to-school and Christmas shopping seasons. First, I will highlight the movement I see coming in each segment of Intel during 2015. Then, I will review Intel's movement in a more quantitative fashion. The article will conclude with a review of likely perception swing. All three of these analyses point to a great year for Intel. Growth in Intel data center sales, and more importantly, growth in the company's profits in this area, will drive significant increases in INTC's profits. In my recent article , I noted that the Intel Data Center group now provides 65% of the company's profits. The level of profit contributed by DCG over time will grow. Think of DCG as being on the beginning of the steep upward rise in a bell curve. The chart below shows growth in sales of the various platforms relative to each other (scales adjusted to show relative growth). The overall trends are important, and this article will focus on the part of the curves between the two vertical dashed lines representing the balance of 2015. Note, that as we move forward, the data center curve gets steeper while some trends are flat or declining. Over the next five years, the data center sales rate becomes the steepest curve. Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ) estimates that by 2020 there will be 50 billion Internet of Things devices connected to the Internet. Even at that point, we would have only penetrated about 3% of all objects that potentially could be connected to the Internet of Things. While the IoT will provide significant revenue growth for Intel, the IoT must be supported by growth in data center capacity (more Intel sales and profits). Intel, while dabbling in the high-visibility home automation area of IoT, is firmly focused on the industrial, automotive, and retail aspects of IoT. These IoT uses provide significant returns on investment by reducing business costs and increasing business revenues. In my mind, this group includes all devices that we personally use for computing, including desktop, laptop, ultra-thins, 2-in-1s, tablets, phablets and smartphones. The chart above shows that desktop sales have peaked, laptops (including ultra-thins) are still growing, tablets have slowed considerably, and smartphones are still growing but will slow over the next five years. Since Intel's investment in mobile is misunderstood by many, I provide here a summary of why the company continues to invest in mobile: Moore's law drives computing smaller and smaller makes computing more mobile. The continuation of Moore's law down to 7nm and then likely into more compact 3D and further integration will provide Intel with huge advantages in mobile. Previous management missed this point. Current management is investing in the future of Intel so it stays dominant in future digital revolutions which we can't even describe right now. Selling more mobile device chips helps to spread the cost of IP development over more units. More than half of the $4b-plus annual loss in mobile is to develop broadly-used IP (allocation of new node development, communications, integration, etc.). Selling more mobile device chips helps to increase the dominance of Intel Architecture platforms and helps drive more sales in the data center group. Note that eventually selling more mobile will be making more Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPhone chips. A reduction of $800m in Intel contra revenue for mobile device chips will provide a welcome boost to earnings in late 2015. A major factor in increasing PC sales in the last half of 2015 will be the introduction of Windows 10 along with Skylake during the summer. I think this combination will unlock significant pent-up demand for PCs in both the consumer and business sectors. Intel shows NAND sales in its "other" group, making tracking and estimates difficult. I prefer to think of NAND as part of the Data Center Group since Intel sells most of its NAND through solid-state drives to data centers for high profit margins. With the upcoming cost disruptive 3D NAND, profits in this area will continue to grow along with data center growth. A common method of estimating future stock price is to estimate earnings per share (EPS) and then multiply EPS times a price-to-earnings ratio (PE). EPS estimates can be taken from Intel's guidance, analyst estimates, and our own estimates. First, let's look at EPS estimates based on Intel's guidance. Based on Intel's latest guidance, it appears that EPS for 2015 will be in the $2.20 to $2.40 range, depending on how the guidance is interpreted. Analysts estimate a range of EPS from $1.97 to $2.98 (4/13/15 Jefferies: follow link for details). Apparently, some analysts have very little confidence in Intel's guidance (some much lower and some much higher). The analyst average EPS estimate for 2015 is $2.17, according to Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ). Below, I use the simple average of the high and low since Jefferies estimate is not included in Yahoo's average. Now, let's consider PE ratios. Over the last five years, the Intel PE ratio has ranged between a low of about 8 to a high of about 17, a huge range. The chart below shows the relationships over time between EPS, PE and stock price. Generally, as EPS increases, the PE also increases, providing a compounding effect on stock prices. The reverse applies when EPS trends down. Last year, as EPS trended higher, the PE trended higher, creating significant increases in stock prices. Now that the EPS has dropped, the PE has dropped, and stock prices have dropped dramatically. I relate the change in PE to the "shine" of the company. Growing profits add shine to the company, and the PE goes up. Other factors can also change the shine such as global economic changes, acquisitions, technology announcements, etc. The table below summarizes this review. The range of estimates to me is a matter of perspective. Different people look at Intel from different angles, just like people look at different sides of a statue and develop different descriptions of it. My perspective includes looking at Intel by evaluating the likely success of its strategic initiatives in data center, IoT, PCs, mobile and NAND. These are the core of Intel's revenue and profits. Tip Ranks provides an encouraging view of analysts' estimates. While the average price target for Intel is $36.48, five of the top 11 analysts have recent price targets of $40 and above. Balance of 2015: Increasing Sales/Profits Across all Platforms All of the platforms listed above will see increased sales and profits during the last half of 2015. Listening to various presentations made by Intel, including the November Intel Investor Day, IDF15 in Shenzhen, and earnings conference calls in January and April, it is clear that sales and profits will increase in the last half of 2015. Likely, these increases in the last half of 2015 will be not just significant (as guided by Intel), but dramatic. Guidance and analysts indicate that EPS will increase, according to the blue bars below. To get to Jefferies and my estimate of ~$3 in EPS for 2015, the increases in quarterly EPS indicated in the red are necessary. This dramatic increase in EPS is certainly possible and requires strong execution by Intel, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), various cloud providers, various OEMs and good global economic conditions. A lot to ask for, but possible and increasingly likely. Intel has made it clear that sales and profits will increase during the last half of 2015. This is becoming more clear to the market, as analysts start to recognize the potential. As more presentations are made and more information becomes available to confirm the dramatic growth in EPS described in this article, Intel stock price will climb. Intel options will rise dramatically. Imagine the interest in Intel stock if the EPS for the 3rd quarter is double the earnings for the first quarter.
