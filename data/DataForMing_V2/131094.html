Is Apple Making An iPhone Mistake? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Analyst details possibility of cannibalization. Back in May, I detailed how I believed Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) could launch three new iPhones in September for its annual refresh of the smartphone. My premise was that we would see updated models of the two larger screen phones that have sold extremely well. Additionally, we would see a significantly upgraded 4 inch version, where Apple uses the 5S/5C form factor as its starting point. This strategy would allow the company to satisfy upgraders that want both a larger screen and those who don't. Unfortunately, the latest reports state that Apple is not planning on launching a 4 inch smartphone in the next couple of months. Cowen and Company analyst Timothy Arcuri stated that evidence of the rumored low-cost iPhone 6C has disappeared since around March. Part of his research note to investors contained the following quote regarding possible cannibalization: "I think one of the reasons is because the iPhone 6 has sold so well," Arcuri said. "And they said, 'Look, why would we want to cannibalize? If we came out with an iPhone 6C, we would essentially cannibalize a price-reduced iPhone 6.'" We've heard conflicting reports about whether a new 4 inch iPhone was actually in production. Some firms in the link above detail the possibility of an iPhone 6C coming sometime in 2016, perhaps one that is compatible with Apple Pay. I don't see why Apple would wait that long, because those that like the 4 inch version of the 5S/5C are eligible for upgrades in just a few months. If they don't want the larger screen models, you are giving them a possible excuse to look elsewhere for a phone. Given Apple's history with phones, I would think that the 5S/5C will be discontinued with this year's launch. For Apple, this seems to be a debate over pricing and margins versus market share. Since the 4 inch model would be cheaper than its larger screen counterparts, it would likely be priced a bit lower. In this case, the smaller screen model would probably not be capable of achieving as high margins. In the end, Apple would see this basically as the 5C, version two, a strategy which I don't think the company is interested in currently. On the other hand, if the company is truly concerned with increasing its global market share, then it definitely makes sense to have three phones. Giving consumers the most potential options should get you the most possible customers. With a sizable upgrade base that may not want a giant phone, the 4 inch would fit that need. Even if only a few percent of current holders would stay with the 4 inch, you're talking about millions of iPhones annually. Does Apple really want to pass up say 10 or 15 million potential customers just so it can maintain super high pricing or margins? I think the company may be making a mistake if it decides against a 4 inch smartphone this year. It doesn't seem likely that the 5S will continue much longer, given how outdated the hardware is in that model. While I can understand how Apple wants to maintain its premium pricing and decent margins, investors want to see the smartphone continue its strong growth. The latest quarterly report ended up being a slight disappointment as iPhone sales came in a little light and guidance for the iPhone launch quarter seemed soft. For a stock that's always held to the highest expectations, I would want Apple to sell the most phones. Without a 4 inch model, Apple may risk losing potential customers that don't want to upgrade to a larger screen phone. Source: Is Apple Making An iPhone Mistake?
