Apple Sales Could Decline This Year: Investors Need To Lower Expectations - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha iPhone sales could miss the mark next quarter, based in part on recent iPhone supplier data. The data seems pretty convincing, and also comes from a reliable source. iPhone's product strategy didn't work this year and this could be blamed on storage and the slowing pace of innovation. Innovation doesn't happen overnight, but Apple could have upgraded storage without impacting margins too significantly. I'm a little more cautious on my outlook and I'm lowering my buy recommendation to hold. Yes, Apple is cheap, but it's also facing weakening fundamentals and issues with execution. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) took a bit of a hit in Tuesday's session, as investors called into question the Apple supply chain. Everyone else more or less piled on and started selling throughout the session, as data from some more reliable sources was released. I'm not necessarily a supply chain analyst, but I know that there's been a lot said about Apple's upcoming quarterly report when pertaining specifically to the iPhone 6s/6s Plus. In a report released on Tuesday from Credit Suisse , the data was pretty grimacing: We now expect the iPhone component supply chain to see single-digit Y-o-Y decline in 4Q15, and ~20% Y-o-Y decline in 1Q16. We expect the iPhone component supply chain to see negative earning impact, from lower blended ASP (given a less favorable product mix), and margin pressure, along with the earlier and deeper order cuts. The earnings impact on the iPhone component supply chain could come from two aspects: (1) lower blended ASP, due to a less favorable product mix (more 6 than 6s), and (2) bigger margin pressure, along with the earlier and deeper order cuts. It's hard to tell what the exact impact will be on Apple's next quarter/sales earnings because in the month of September, the supply chain ramped up and hit some pretty staggering sell-in figures. The supply chain grew by 23% year over year in the month of September. However, following the month of September, October orders were cut significantly by approximately 10% versus expectations of 5%, according to Credit Suisse. So, maybe Apple overproduced in September, and it's taking a while for the supply chain to lean out? Furthermore, the sales mix isn't as good this year, as analysts are anticipating iPhone 6/6 Plus to make up a higher percentage of the mix. I'm having a hard time imagining how Apple will sell more iPhones this year. In other words, if this pattern of weakening sales pertaining to channel partners continues, the impact on Apple's earnings/revenue won't be good. A recent report from MacRumors indicates that Apple is working on releasing a 4-inch variation of the iPhone 6s series in the first half of 2016. As a result of its smaller screen, Apple may price the device at an even lower price point. Therefore, I anticipate that the new product mix may impact ASPs negatively. I'm not sure if a smaller iPhone will appeal to Apple purists, as many have already moved onto the bigger form factor. The ASP mix is likely to weaken over the course of this quarter, as many believe Force Touch isn't a compelling enough feature to pay an incremental $100 from the prior year's model. And realistically, Apple needed to transition the iPhone 6s/6s Plus to higher memory configurations at the base and high-end given the falling price of flash memory in the trailing 12-month period. I don't understand why Apple, having the highest margins in the smartphone space, would skimp out and not offer 32GB or 64GB configurations as a base model. Perhaps it is worried consumers would not move up the stack to 64GB and 128GB. To offset that impact, Apple could have moved the storage mix from 32GB on up to 256GB. The extra storage wouldn't have impacted margins from the prior year too significantly, and it could have had a better product for the mid-cycle refresh. The price of 256GB MLC flash fell from $20.30 to $14.43 year over year, which represents a 29% reduction in price. The cost of implementing higher storage would not have put much of a damper on margins, as Apple can access spot prices as it's the largest purchaser of flash memory. Furthermore, various third-party firms routinely mis-estimate the cost of iPhone, as IHS mentions that the bill of materials is $211.50. The firm's estimate doesn't factor in warranty costs, deferred software upgrades and product support. Hence, Apple's reported gross margin figure is substantially less than the gross margin that's implied by the bill of materials. The cost of components could go down, but the cost of servicing devices, and labor costs pertaining to support, and warranties will either remain constant or increase. IHS estimates that Apple pays $.35/GB or less for NAND flash modules. So, based on that calculation, Apple would have to pay $89.60 for 256GB, $44.80 for 128GB, and $22.50 for 64GB flash modules? Memory modules for 16GB, 32GB, 128GB, 256GB NAND are substantially cheaper than what IHS estimates. In other words, Apple could have increased memory configurations without impacting gross margins substantially, because Apple would have paid $10 more for a 256GB flash module as opposed to 128GB. The falling price of NAND modules is driven by the rapid improvement in densities pertaining to flash modules, which reduces the cell cost without negatively impacting wafer yields. In other words, the price of flash has dropped so convincingly that there was no legitimate reason for selling 16GB, 64GB, 128GB configurations this year. It could have doubled memory across every product SKU and it would have impacted margins by a couple hundred basis points. A couple hundred basis points in margins sacrificed to prevent sales from declining year over year? Guys (Apple management), come on, it's such an easy decision to make. The stinginess of Apple will sting shareholders this quarter, as it could have doubled storage this year to encourage replacement demand. Instead, people passed on the upgrade, because the iPhone 6s is more about speed and user interface improvements. I think many would have upgraded had Apple readjusted the memory configurations this year as many are held captive to limited storage capacities. Furthermore, additional storage would have equated into more app/music downloads. Apple would not only have directly benefited in the form of higher iPhone sales, but users would have had the spare space to buy more apps and music offsetting the cost of higher memory. Instead, many will be limited by memory constraints, which has negative implications on Apple's software ecosystem. Who wants to spend $200 more for an iPhone that allows you to carry more apps, photos, and videos? Not many people, and quite frankly I'm kind of frustrated because I'm going to get duped into buying an iPhone with 128GB of storage at a ridiculous retail markup. I know I'll run out of space on 64GB once I start taking videos, photos, and download even more apps. In fact, I've already confronted this issue with my 128GB MacBook, so over the long haul even 128GB becomes a bit small, but more so for phones that have 4K camera/video capability. Hopefully, next year's iPhone 7 isn't the same, because memory prices are going to drop even further. But will Apple take advantage of those falling prices? History has pointed out that it hasn't, and if I'm not mistaken, the very first Macintosh didn't come with enough RAM. This year, the iPhone didn't have enough storage. These are easily preventable problems and Apple should have done everything within its power to stimulate demand for the iPhone even if it meant sacrificing a couple dollars to create a superior user experience. Since it has fallen below its usual quality threshold, Apple's sales have suffered. Tim Cook may face the peanut gallery for poor execution and judgment on next quarter's call. I'm downgrading Apple from a buy to a hold. I maintain my $131 price target. I still anticipate some upside given how cheap the company is on comparative value metrics. Additionally, there could be some room to offset the weakness in iPhone assuming other product categories perform better than expected.
