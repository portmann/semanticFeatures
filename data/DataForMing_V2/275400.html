Apple: Total Repatriation Is A Pipe Dream - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha SA contributor Alex Cho suggests Apple bring all of its foreign cash home. The scenario involved would not work in today's market. On Monday, SA contributor Alex Cho suggested that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) should bring its huge foreign cash pile home . By doing so, Apple could execute an extremely large buyback, significantly reducing the outstanding share count and tremendously boosting earnings per share. Unfortunately, the argument contains a number of issues, and the dynamics of today's market would not allow this scenario to work out as well as hoped. First, there is an error in the facts involved in this scenario. The article suggests that there is $56.5 billion left on Apple's current buyback, but take a look at what is stated on page 60 of Apple's most recent 10-K filing : In the third quarter of 2015, the Company's Board of Directors increased the share repurchase authorization to $140 billion of the Company's common stock, of which $104 billion had been utilized as of September 26, 2015. That leaves $36 billion on the buyback, and since we have just finished Apple's fiscal Q1 period this past weekend, another quarter worth of buybacks have likely been completed. If we assume about $5 billion for the quarter, that's a $25 billion difference right there between Mr. Cho's scenario and reality. Based on a Monday morning share price of $106.30, that equates to 235 million shares, or 4.21% of Apple's September quarter ending outstanding share count. The percentage is likely higher given another quarter of buybacks. The second item that's implied in the article is that the share price stays stagnant in this case. If Apple were to bring back all of its foreign cash to execute such a large buyback, this is a material event that would need to be announced. For the company to execute such a large executed buyback, it would likely need to execute a tender offer. In this case, who is going to want to sell shares to Apple at the current market price, when they can do so in the open market? Apple would likely have to pay a substantial premium, I'm guessing at least 10%, which would additionally reduce the amount of shares that could be bought back. The other problem that this big buyback would leave is the post-buyback balance sheet. If we assume all of Apple's foreign cash is used up, Apple would have just the $19 billion of its US cash left on the balance sheet, against nearly $65 billion of total debt at the end of the September quarter. While Apple did generate billions of cash in the December quarter, it's unclear at this point how much was returned to shareholders and if any more debt was taken on. While Apple generates a significant amount of cash on a quarterly basis, most of it is generated outside the US. Apple's first few debt issues launched when the capital return plan was started a few years ago are starting to come due in the next couple of years. With such a low cash balance and high debt load, the company would probably need to refinance at higher rates, which would result in additional interest expenses. Don't forget, the dramatic reduction in Apple's cash holdings would reduce interest income, reducing some of the benefits provided by the big buyback. With such a debt heavy balance sheet, higher interest rates could stop the company from taking out more debt, which could mean future buybacks would be extremely limited or nonexistent, given how much of Apple's US cash production is funneled towards the dividend. Sure, the outstanding share count would see a significant one-time drop, but if buybacks stop it would just start rising again. I also think this scenario would provide the Apple bear camp with even more fuel. The bears would say "okay, now what", as they would contend that Apple is out of ideas for growth. As Mr. Cho pointed out in his article, the company could buy 16 mid-cap companies at an average valuation of $10 billion or so with its foreign cash. This would instantly provide more revenues (and likely more net income, not just increased earnings per share). Since analysts are currently looking for Apple revenues to increase in the low single digits percentage wise this fiscal year, Apple's revenue growth rate would increase quite a bit thanks to acquisitions. With the market down on Monday morning, Apple shares are at a multi-month low, as seen in the chart at the end of this article. There has been a recent panic over iPhone sales in the March ending period, sending Q2 revenue estimates lower in quite a hurry: In my above linked article, many of the comments suggested that Apple management should not change its future strategy to please wall street. This would seem to be just what the company would be doing with a massive buyback. Mr. Cho's article overstated what would actually happen with the share count, given where the buyback actually is and how a tender offer would likely come at a higher price. After this occurs, the bear camp would come out firing again, and Apple would be unlikely to repurchase many more shares given its huge debt load and low cash position. A big buyback would probably result in a quick one-time pop for shares, but then they would likely come back down as the company would no longer be scooping up shares on a quarterly basis. So what should Apple do with its foreign cash holdings? Well, I agree to an extent that some of the money could be repatriated. Perhaps Apple could bring back a few billion each quarter, so that it doesn't have to pay such a large one-time tax bill, and the share count can be steadily reduced over time. However, I think depleting the foreign cash pile limits the company's financial flexibility for the future, and would send the completely wrong message to investors and the street. Apple has garnered a substantial market cap by following a specific and forthright strategy, and deviating wildly from the plan would seem to be an error.
