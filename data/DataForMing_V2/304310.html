There is evidence that the AMOLED industry is about to make a long-awaited shift to wet production. That would level the playing field for new manufacturers, and AUO would be the best play on this shift. AUO is also an ideal and much needed partner for Apple's designs on this space, and there is evidence that the collaboration is already underway. The world keeps on changing. Two-and-a-half years ago, I began writing about how AMOLED (active matrix organic light emitting diode) screens could begin taking over the display industry from LCD, just as LCD took over from CRT before it. Today, we are increasingly inundated with evidence of that change. Change is kind to some and very unkind to others. Shares of Universal Display (NASDAQ: OLED ), a key provider of AMOLED technology, have more than doubled since I highlighted the " last chance sale " on them, and its Korean customers, Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) and more recently, LG Display (NYSE: LPL ) have become the world's leading screen producers in the process. By contrast, screen makers in Japan, like Sharp ( OTCPK:SHCAY ) and Toshiba ( OTCPK:TOSYY ), have been hurt very badly by the shift. Then, there are those in the middle. Even though Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has been left behind on the technology, its margins have benefited from being able to source cheap LCD screens from desperate Japanese manufacturers. Another company that has been caught in the middle is the world's third-largest display manufacturer, AU Optronics (NYSE: AUO ). Unlike Apple, AUO has been a pioneer of AMOLED technology from the very beginning. It developed the world's first double-sided screen in 2004 and its list of more recent AMOLED technological achievements includes: 2014 - first in-cell touch for wearables 2015 - latest smart watch displays garnered the prestigious SID Best in Show award 2015 - demonstrated a flexible screen that can detect being bent in multiple directions Yet, anyone who knows the industry will realize that technological excellence has not translated into broad market success, as it did in the early days of LCD, when AUO shares traded between $10 and $20. The company did not invest heavily and struggled with manufacturing yields early on, thereby allowing Samsung to lead the way in mobile, while LG Display solved the large screen problem with its WOLED architecture for televisions. Still, there is reason to believe that Taiwan can leapfrog the Koreans. Part of the reluctance to invest heavily early on probably stems from the inherent expense of current AMOLED manufacturing methods. Even the current manufacturing leaders believe that current processes will be merely a transitional step toward printed screens that use soluble materials. There are signs throughout the industry that this transition is at hand. Industrial giant Merck KGaA ( OTCPK:MKGAY ) has focused on soluble materials and collaborated with Taiwanese development efforts for many years. Merck announced a new plant to produce materials for AMOLED displays and lighting devices this past summer. The company claims it will be a leader in these materials by 2018, and has just reaffirmed those intentions in its outlook for 2016. Mitsubishi ( OTC:MTLHF ) and Pioneer ( OTCPK:PNCOF ) announced that they have started to mass produce color-tunable lighting panels using a wet coating process. This is potentially significant for displays as well as lighting in that such methods could be a precursor to ink jet printing of displays. Ink jet display printing leader Kateeva began working with DuPont in June, saying "the industry is poised to take a significant step forward in achieving low cost mass production." Shortly thereafter, Kateeva more than doubled its manufacturing capacity to ramp up production of its YIELDjet platform. Kateeva also partnered with Sumitomo Chemical ( OTCPK:SOMMY ) at the beginning of the year to optimize YIELDJet for Sumitomo's polymer materials. Sumitomo's main customer is Samsung Display, which purchases panels for AMOLED touch screens. Sumitomo is now expanding its production capacity by 40% in order to meet increased demand and enable the use plastic substrates for bendable displays. Ink Jet manufacturing of AMOLEDs should be far less costly and more material efficient than any current processes for any type of competing screen. For example, the Mitsubishi/Pioneer panels mentioned above use just one-third the material of the evaporative manufacturing methods now being used to make AMOLED panels in Korea. Consequently, I question the market's assumption that UDC will continue to be the primary beneficiary, as implied by OLED valuation. Although, UDC has stated that its small-molecule phOLED emitters are compatible with soluble manufacturing techniques, that remains to be seen in practice. It is quite possible that polymer phOLED emitters could be better suited. Even if UDC is able to maintain its role through the transition, the efficiencies in material usage should go a long way towards balancing industry growth, as should continued pricing pressure. My concern is that the current flood of media on the company's shares is an attempt by institutions to cash out. For AU Optronics though, a jump forward in manufacturing represents a new opportunity to leverage its technology. Using solution-based processing will mean that existing manufacturers will have to go through the process of re-tweaking production to optimize yields all over again. A newly level playing field could well be just what AUO and Taiwan have been waiting for. Though Taiwan has trailed Korea in AMOLED production capacity, it arguably still leads in research and development. In fact, Taiwan's research institute, ITRI , seems to have uncovered the most important breakthrough in recent memory with its PCOLED method of solving the blue problem. Combining this approach with AUO's RGBY architecture should make for a clear lead in the mobile arms race. Taiwan's government has also shown willingness to support the industry, much as Korea and Japan have done, and foster cooperation in ways the chaebol have proven incapable of. In fact, the move may already be underway. The main thing that is needed to fast track such plans is a guaranteed critical mass of demand. That's where Apple comes in. Whether by coincidence or not, many of Apple's design aspirations seem to match up almost perfectly with AUO's technology demonstrations. Compare, for instance, this flex-sensing screen patent , with the prototype that AUO showed just last month. I think it is more than coincidence that Apple has opened a secret lab in Taiwan and employed former AUO workers. The interesting part here is that the lab also used to be used for Mirasol development. For those who don't know, Mirasol was a very promising color display technology. In fact, it was the only one that I regarded as a potential competitor for AMOLEDs before Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) discontinued its commercialization efforts in favor of licensing the technology instead, in order to give some much needed attention to decisions surrounding its core business. AUO's latest work in transflective watch faces shows that there may be great promise in combining these technologies. Apple is already using LG Display's for the AMOLED screen on its Watch, but there have been reports of dissatisfaction with that arrangement. In any case, neither LGD nor Samsung is an ideal source for Apple because both already produce competing mobile devices . By contrast, AUO is a potentially ideal partner because it is pure producer rather than a competitor. If Apple wants to leapfrog the display industry, the more than 15,300 patents and nearly 22,000 applications that AUO holds worldwide will be vital, especially considering that AUO has already been successful in proving them against both LG Display and Samsung . The most difficult part about investing in developing technology is often projecting the pace of innovation. While Apple's job postings and purchase of nearby pilot fabrication facilities indicate that its plans are fairly far along, delays and changes are always possible. Such uncertainty represents the biggest risk factor to the projections made here. That said, AU Optronics is not completely beholden to future developments. The company can continue to play both sides of the LCD/AMOLED battle in large screens via its alliance with 3M (NYSE: MMM ) on QDTVs . Furthermore, AUO's AMOLED screens for phones are finally competitive and the current lineup of watch faces looks to be clearly best in class and earning wins in new products already. To my eye, the market is valuing AUO simply based on the existing LCD market which has seen plenty of pain over the past year. Though this article obviously has a different focus, it should not be ignored that, on average, analysts expect the company to lose 1 cent per share when it reports again at the end of January. However, with PE of just 5 and 5% dividend yield, I think it's hardly a stretch to call the stock oversold even considering only the current business. Note also that cash flow is expected to almost double from 19 to 37 cents per share. Other SA authors have already covered the (under)valuation of the existing business. I would hope that any readers managing their own investments are capable of doing such basic research and math themselves, but I am happy to engage in Q&A. My experience is that markets are forward-looking, which is why this article focuses on new technology and evidence of impending business developments. Hopefully, Apple has learned the dangers of trying to micro-manage developing technology, and in any case AU Optronics is no GT Advanced ; its well-established business is easily profitable and its management ranked amongst the top 5% for corporate governance this year. The point here is that AUO doesn't need to execute on all this new technology overnight in order to succeed. It can start by supplying faces for the next Apple Watch, or a niche version of the iPhone, such as the rumored 4" model , and AUO investors should profit very nicely in 2016, with more to look forward to. In fact, I think Samsung's impressive sales of AMOLEDs to third parties shows that AUO doesn't even necessarily need Apple to succeed, as that market remains production constrained. Nonetheless, there is evidence of an impending collaboration, and the two are ideal partners with complementary resources for adapting to a changing world. Change is good; especially for those who see it coming . Tagged: Investing Ideas , Technology
