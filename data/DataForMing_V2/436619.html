The Disney Collaboration Can Drive Coach's Stock Higher - Coach, Inc. (NYSE:COH) | Seeking Alpha Coach has launched its Disney x Coach 1941 Collaboration with a lot of positive feedback. Its Coach x Peanuts limited time promotion was very successful, according to management. We believe this will be even more successful and comes at a great time. Its products are already in strong demand from Chinese consumers and the launch of Disneyland Shanghai could heighten this demand. We have been invested in Coach (NYSE: COH ) for a few months now with mixed results. Things got off to a great start with the stock climbing around 8%, but the retail apparel jitters that hit the market a month or two back certainly saw to that. Its stock is now down by about 1% from when we bought in. Considering some of the disasters in the retail industry, though, this is not a bad result. But we see a new catalyst that we expect will drive Coach's stock much higher, and that is its collaboration with Disney (NYSE: DIS ). We believe the "Disney x Coach 1941 Collaboration" is going to be a huge win for Coach, which is celebrating its 75th anniversary. The Coach brand had already been showing signs of a resurgence with a solid third quarter and now this collaboration should help the luxury retailer build on it. The Disney x Coach 1941 Collaboration is a great way for Coach to differentiate itself from its competitors Michael Kors (NYSE: KORS ) and Kate Spade (NYSE: KATE ). Although each brand has its own particular nuances that a trained eye would see, for the casual observer there is little way of noticing. As you can see on the image above, the collaboration certainly provides a unique touch to its designs and really catches the eye. It does appear to have caught the eye of consumers with reports that Coach's Instagram feed has been gaining more attention than usual. With influential celebrities such as Kendall Jenner helping to promote it as well, this certainly will not go unnoticed by the company's target demographic. As we briefly mentioned at the top, Coach delivered a solid third quarter . Although comparable store sales were flat, earnings were up to 44 cents per share from 36 cents per share a year earlier. The top line grew by 11% to $1.03 billion, which was ahead of consensus. This means that for the first nine months of the fiscal year, revenue is up 4.7% to $3.34 billion. With just over a week to go until the end of its fiscal year, we don't believe the Disney collaboration will make a noticeable impact to overall revenue until the first quarter. Although having said that, the media coverage and feedback on the launch has been incredibly good, so there is a chance that many consumers will flock to retailers in droves this week. Part of the reason for the solid third quarter was the success of its limited time Coach X Peanuts collaboration - better known as the Snoopy collection. On the earnings call , CEO Victor Luis remarked that: "We also had an exceptional response to the snoopy fashion vignette as mentioned, proving that this customer will respond to innovation and novelty." Peanuts and Snoopy are very popular, but in no way can they be compared to Disney and Mickey Mouse. This gives us a lot of confidence that the Disney collaboration is going to be a big boost to the top line in fiscal 2017. Considering the formula has been working well thus far, we expect there will be more limited time collaborations in the future as well that will help keep sales growing over the long term and not just the short term. In our opinion, this launch enhances our original investment thesis which was based upon strong demand from Chinese consumers, according to reports on CNBC . Research by Euromonitor had shown that Coach was amongst the top items being bought by Chinese tourists. These 120 million tourists are spending over $165 billion each year (as of 2014), so to be in demand with this demographic is fantastic. With Shanghai Disneyland opening, there could not be a better time to launch the product. As we said last time, with the strong growth prospects that lay ahead, we feel a price-to-earnings ratio of 23 is fair for Coach. For the full year, we still anticipate earnings per share of $1.95, giving us a price target of $44.85 for the end of FY 2016. But looking to next year, we see earnings growing at a good rate to $2.15 per share thanks to its Disney collaboration. If it can achieve this, then we would expect to see the stock climbing as high as $49.45, equating to an upside of 29%. In our opinion, this is a great time to invest in Coach.
