Jay Z Sells Out To Apple - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha While M&A Daily has long steered clear of the brewing hip hop battle between New York and Fairfield County, Connecticut, it is time to weigh in: Jay Z is selling out. He is talking with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) about selling them his streaming music service Tidal. Mr. Z bought the company for $56 million last year and could stand to make a substantial profit on the deal. Before entering talks with Apple, Tidal was looking to sell to Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) but those talks fell through and there no longer appear to be other suitors preparing bids. Tidal will help Apple compete with Pandora (NYSE: P ) and Spotify. This deal will also resolve acrimony between the companies related to Apple's delaying approval of Tidal's app updates.
