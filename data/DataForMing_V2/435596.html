Beijing orders halt to sales of two iPhone models - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Jun 17 2016, 08:41 ET | By: Stephen Alpher , SA News Editor Beijing's intellectual property regulator orders Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) to stop sales of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in the city, ruling the design infringes on a patent for exterior design held by Shenzhen Baili for its 100C smartphone. The impact isn't immediately clear given some stores in Beijing stopped selling those iPhones months ago, switching to new models. Apple itself will soon end production of both models. I had the same thought along with I wonder if they are trying to extort Apple in some way. This all seems very fishy Seeking Alpha did not do their homework in republishing a defective WSJ article. The text implies it's earlier iPhone models not the current iP6 and iP6S models. WSJ STOCK MANIPULATION AGAIN??? Well fact is CHINA does as it pleases and everyone bends backwards to do business there due to their buying power. I would not be surprised if it is an extortion ploy. Everyone wants a piece of that 200 Billion in Cash. If it's true what's the process here. Why is this a surprise. Was Apple not a participation in a negotiation before they were slammed.  A number of things don't make sense here.
