Apple Has Lost Its Monopoly - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Steve Jobs' aura is all but gone from Apple. We look at the safety of Apple's dividend and future dividend increases. The main concern is a possible cash crunch in a recession, resulting from Apple's high debt-to-equity ratio. Should Apple decide to admit it is now a value stock, young investors buying AAPL likely can live off the dividends in their retirement. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is near its 52-week low, bringing the dividend up to 2.2%, an all-time high since Apple re-instituted its dividend in 2012. Long-term investors naturally see this as a deep discount on a strong company. AAPL has long been considered a growth stock, but the outlook for "growth" has only recently begun to subside. The truth is, several factors have changed in both the internals of Apple and the overall market to re-position the company not as a monopoly on new technology, but as a pure competitive business wielding brand alone. In this article, we take a more in-depth look at post-dividend Apple. I hope you will agree with me that AAPL is no longer a growth stock, but a value stock that should be restructured as a future dividend aristocrat . Apple's insane growth was fueled by a monopoly. The company hinted at its ability to innovate with the iPod, but this product was not Apple's monopoly - it was merely an outlet for conspicuous consumption. No one needed a dial instead of a button to switch songs. Likewise, no one needed the massive amount of disk space to "place to 1,000 songs in their pockets," which would be the equivalent of 83 hours of music. And that was the original iPod. Later versions upped the disk space by over 25 times. You would have to listen to your iPod for three months before you've heard every song on a full iPod. It was the release of the iPhone and iPad that gave Apple its monopoly, as no products (successful products, anyway - there were previous attempts by other companies) offered what these devices offered. With iPhone 5 being the last product Steve Jobs touched, Apple has lost its innovation, now owning a brand that must compete with the likes of Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ), Sharp ( OTCPK:SHCAY ), and HTC ( OTC:HTCXF ). Apple lost its monopoly, the main catalyst of its growth. They might be pushing out new products, but whether Steve Jobs, whom many would agree was the driving force of Apple's innovation, would be a fan of these products is arguable. Apple has already dropped many of the strict design rules Jobs had stuck to during his time as the CEO. I am not saying post-Jobs Apple is a bust. A better way of looking at post-Jobs Apple is the same way we look at post-Kroc McDonald's (NYSE: MCD ). If you're familiar with the history of McDonald's, you'll know that Dick and Mac McDonald were not the ones to turn their restaurant into an Apple-scale growth story. No, it was Ray Kroc, who decided to innovate on the brothers' restaurant. Ray Kroc was perhaps a soulmate of Steve Jobs, as they took their companies to the big time in parallel fashion. Most important for their companies' growth were the strict limitations on what their companies did. Kroc greatly cut down on the McDonald's menu and focused on speed, creating the concept of "fast food." Jobs cut down on his company's products, famously pointing out that his best decisions were what projects to reject. Jobs didn't need a dozen colors and sizes for his product releases; he merely wanted a single product that changed the way people lived their lives. But the Apple of today has iPhones with increasingly large screens, and iPods of increasingly small size (these two products are now converging - do we really need both?). Apple's release of the Apple Watch polarized Apple fans. It brought the company in competition for expensive real estate (the wrist) against watch companies. But more importantly, it didn't drastically change the way people lived. Today's Apple has lost its innovation. It might continue to make small steps forward, much like McDonald's small steps forward. But Apple's versions of in-restaurant playgrounds and healthy menus are exactly what they seem: Incentives for brand advocates to stay with the brand - not incentives for non-users to begin using the brand. Let's face it: Apple's growth was as awe-inspiring as McDonald's. But both companies are done growing. With competitors diluting the market, Apple is all about maintaining its brand, which situates it as a competition company - not an innovation company. The natural result of such a transition is that the stock no longer can be seen as a growth stock. AAPL is now a value stock. Being so, if Apple has the ability to do so, it should focus on giving value to shareholders via a dividend, not expected growth. One only need look at the numbers to see that this is so. Apple's return on invested capital (ROIC) has fallen since Jobs passed away in 2011: This should not be taken as a downfall in Apple any more than McDonald's market saturation. Instead, we should look at the present as a time in which Apple must make the transition to a brand-based company, much like McDonald's. By keeping the brand in high regard, Apple can extract from its customers higher margins than its competitors, keeping profits high and allowing for a stable dividend as well as consistent dividend increases. If today's Apple does not accept its newfound place in the market, it will implode. Throwing money at new products when you have lost the ability to truly innovate will only harm the bottom line, and that financial damage will be passed onto shareholders in the form of a deflating stock. Investors do not want to see a repeat of the GoPro (NASDAQ: GPRO ). We will look at Apple's financials, starting from 2012, to analyze the safety and growth prospects of their dividend. The main question is whether the current dividend is safe and whether it can be safely raised. Many financial indicators will help explain how high Apple can raise its dividend without trouble. If we are looking to make Apple a long-term dividend aristocrat, we hope to see stability in earnings per share: Stability is the most important aspect of EPS for a value stock. Growth is also important if the company is to consistently raise dividends. We see both of these characteristics in Apple. Free cash flow is also an important aspect. Because a dividend grower must dedicate an increasingly large amount of its cash to dividend payouts, free cash flow must grow. This is another attribute that Apple possesses: I have performed dividend analyses for many stocks, finding many to be tapped out in terms of dividend payments versus free cash flow. Many companies, such as Kinder Morgan, actually are paying unsustainable dividends, with dividend payouts exceeding income. Apple is playing it excessively conservative: As a percentage of free cash flow, Apple's dividend costs are minimal. Apple could easily double its dividend and barely see a dent in free cash flow. In fact, Apple would have to quintuple its dividend to even begin to mimic a REIT, with all cash (not income) flowing to the investors. Of course, I'm not recommending a quintupling of the dividend. I am merely pointing out how Apple is miserly with its dividend. Doubling the dividend would cost little to Apple and be a large bonus to Apple stockholders. Another indicator of dividend stability is the dividend's ability to hold up in a bear market. With a bear market likely in 2016 , this is an important question for Apple. For this analysis, we turn to Apple's debt-to-equity: Apple recently broke the 1:1 ratio. As Apple is highly reliant on the macro economy, an increasing debt-to-equity that is also over 1 is slightly worrisome for the dividend. If Apple faces a cash crisis during a recession, it will be forced to cut the dividend or miss a debt payment. Perhaps in 2016, Apple actually should postpone a large dividend increase, waiting instead until the debt-to-equity ratio is below 1. A 1:2 ratio would even be better. Because 2016 is looking to be a dangerous year, perhaps a massive dividend increase now would be seen as a mistake later. That said, Apple's current dividend is secure. The payout ratio significantly under the free cash flow and even more covered by total income: Apple could stand to take the risk and double its dividend. Doing so would solidify its position as a value stock and likely bring in more investors, thereby raising the stock price. In fact, except for recently, the dividend trends well with the stock price: For many value stocks, the dividend trend is a form of analyzing the stock's trend. That is, perhaps we can use the dividend growth as a form of valuation for AAPL. If this is the case, AAPL looks underpriced, perhaps unfairly hit by investor fear. As I accurately predicted AAPL's price decline in November , I am now predicting AAPL to reverse the downward trend should it present itself as a value stock. As stated previously, institutional investors have much influence over Apple's stock price. Switching to a value-based stock model should help Apple improve stock sentiment with these parties. I give AAPL an overall buy rating, which I would change to outperform if AAPL doubles its dividend. For more on the benefits of doubling dividends, read this article. AAPL's future is one of a value stock. As the result of changing business practices and a loss of its monopoly, Apple must firmly grasp its status as a luxury competition stock. While many will point to iOS or the iPhone as Apple's most important asset, the truth is that Apple's brand is more valuable than anything else it owns now. Management would be well-advised to accept Apple as a business that must rely on maintaining profit margins and market share, not innovation, for growth. Likewise, investors should make their voices heard so that Apple maintains its status as a luxury consumer product in direct competition with companies producing equally useful products. Apple will become a gimmick company should management attempt to follow in its previous leader's footsteps - Steve Jobs took with him an irreplaceable and intangible asset that cannot be duplication. But what he left behind is a mammoth of a company, a company that can easily become a dividend aristocrat. Should Apple decide to go in this direction, young investors buying AAPL now likely can live off the dividends in their retirement. The only risks Apple faces in switching to a value stock model is the relatively high debt-to-equity ratio and its pride.
