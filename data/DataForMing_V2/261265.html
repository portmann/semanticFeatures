Ford: The 'Tesla' Of Conventional Automakers? - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford gets a multiple much lower than companies like Tesla, because it's not considered an innovator. Ford has a leg up on GM, as it allocates capital toward innovation versus returning it to shareholders. The world of automobile manufacturing, as an industry, is a relatively stable business. By that, we mean that there are some relatively decent barriers to entry and that the business does not fall into super volatile declines and advances, but rather it is a relatively steady industry that ebbs and flows with the economy. For that reason alone, automakers are not given multiples that are very aggressive. As you notice from Ford (NYSE: F ), Toyota (NYSE: TM ) and General Motors (NYSE: GM ), auto company PE ratios are generally between eight and 12 times earnings. This is why so many critics of the company Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) have issues. Tesla is not only trading at an enormous price to earnings ratio, but it is trading at an enormous price to anything (book, earnings, sales) ratio, that has led an unprecedented number of people on the short side of the case that claim that Tesla is overvalued due to the lack of cash that it generates and its poor earnings performance. So why has Tesla achieved such a multiple? Of course, this goes back to the age old public company buzzword of whether or not you have a "disruptive" technology. Tesla is getting its multiple because people choose to believe that the company is singlehandedly revolutionizing the automobile industry. Ford and General Motors get their multiples because people choose to believe that they will be safe, sturdy, conservative businesses for years to come. This is why Ford's latest move in investing $4.5 billion into electric vehicles by 2020 is such a brilliant one, we think. Here is a news release by the Detroit Free Press that was put out yesterday, Ford announced its largest five-year investment ever in electrified vehicles, with a pledge to spend $4.5 billion and introduce 13 new models by 2020, CEO Mark Fields announced today. Fields said 40% of nameplates globally will be electrified by the end of the decade, up from 13% now. They will be a mix of hybrids, plug-in hybrids and full battery-powered electric vehicles. It's a move driven by customer demand as well as the need to meet fuel efficiency standards, Fields said. Among the plans is an update to the Ford Focus electric vehicle coming at the end of 2016 for North America and Europe. It will have an improved range of 100 miles and can reach 80% of its charge in 30 minutes, considered the maximum length of time consumers will easily tolerate. The current Focus Electric has a range of 76 miles and can be fully charged in 3.5 hours with a 240-volt outlet. Getting to an 80% charge takes about 2.5 hours. Obviously, we think this is an enormous positive. Ford is thinking "down the line" when electric vehicles will no doubt play a much larger role than they do today. Actually, Ford is doing a great job playing to both crowds; 1. A newly innovated pickup truck line, running on good old fashioned gasoline for your "right wing, heading down to the ranch" type crowd 2. A new investment in electric vehicles for your "left wing, green energy" crowd and younger generations Now all that's left is to surround and capture those in the middle! When we look at the landscape of automobile manufacturers, and we try to locate the much longer wavelength in terms of this industry's adoption curve versus other industries, we see that Ford and General Motors are lagging behind Tesla. Tesla has the disadvantage of no conventional auto business, and Ford and General Motors have the disadvantage of not being known as innovators in the electric space. We think that this investment shows Ford's willingness to spend on itself in order to try and benefit over the course of the long term. We have time and time again criticized General Motors for their rush to deploy capital back to shareholders. We have also, time and time again, commended Ford for the cash that it has spent trying to innovate in places like India, Asia, and now here in the United States. If Ford is going to eventually want to command a higher multiple, it is going to have to show the market that it is a company that is slated for success, not just now, but in the future. Making this type of investment in electric vehicles which, no doubt, will play a much larger role in our future shows the continued focus on the course of the long term for Ford. It's also a brilliant business strategy in diversification of the company's vehicle portfolio. F Dividend Yield (TTM) data by YCharts We continue to think that the company's valuation at current levels makes it attractive, while its dividend yield also adds reason to hold the stock for shareholders. We see this investment in the same way we see Ford's international investments: we think Ford is the far more innovative of the two domestic automakers, and we believe that while companies like Tesla are valued based purely on innovation, Ford is at an advantage in having innovation, but with a solid underlying business to back it up. They could be the "Tesla" of conventional automakers and if the public starts to see them through that lens (and they start boosting the bottom line internationally), we can expect future multiple expansion.
