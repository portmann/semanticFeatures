Foxconn Branching Out Of Its Core 'Big Electronics Factory' Domain - Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. Ltd. (OTCMKTS:HNHAF) | Seeking Alpha Foxconn has multiple future growth drivers beyond being a very large electronics device manufacturer. Diversification includes industrial robots as well as investments in India and elsewhere, such as telecommunications and e-commerce services. Even without accounting for these new growth drivers, Foxconnâ€™s stock offers a solid ~15% upside using conservative growth assumptions which are below Foxconn's historical averages. Apple, China slowdown and currency wars are just some of the many future risks and headwinds. A return to historical growth of the core business plus growth boost from the new investments that are currently in the pipeline would mean a ~49% stock upside potential. Note: this article has been originally presented to my Seeking Alpha subscription service members about a month ago. The stock is up roughly 5% since then but still offers plenty of upside. The figures have been updated to reflect the latest data available. Foxconn (Hon Hai Precision Industry) (OTC: HNHAF ), (OTC: HNHAY ) is clearly operating in a low-margin business. The contract manufacturing side of its operations has a low chance of increasing margins significantly for a sustained period of time. However, thanks to its massive size, its in-house R&D and production of industrial robots and other automation tools, as well as its proactive drive to relocate factories to lower-cost regions closer to the future demand, such as India, Foxconn's margins are likely to be maintained and the company is an attractive long-term investment that is undervalued by ~15% now and should deliver double-digit long-term annual returns. Foxconn will most likely remain cost-competitive under most scenarios. I would characterize Foxconn as a medium-moat-company within a low-margin business. If the stock price paid is low enough, the investment can deliver solid returns despite the low margins. I believe Foxconn has currently approached such a low price area and should be bought for the long run. (The U.S.-listed GDRs are not suitable for investing due to very low liquidity, so I suggest trading HonHai under its primary ticker on the Taiwan Stock Exchange, TPE:2317 via Bloomberg ). Although Foxconn's sales are largely dependent from the final consumer demand and are inherently cyclical, there is a large difference between buying any one specific consumer electronics brand, such as Samsung, Sony, Lenovo, HTC, etc., because consumers may switch brands. But as long as they continue buying new devices yet to be invented, as well as smartphones and tablets every few years, and refreshing their notebooks and TVs once in a while, I believe Foxconn will be there to offer its increasingly integrated services to whichever consumer electronics brand owner will be in fashion in any given time. Foxconn's strategy to offer a one-stop-shop service experience to brand manufacturers, combined with its large size and low cost, will continue to provide a competitive advantage in a low-margin, highly-competitive business. Apple is not going away any time soon but it could diversify away from Foxconn Despite recent fears of Apple's revenue falling, Apple will continue upgrading its products and come up with new ones, as its customer base is very loyal and hooked to the Apple ecosystem. Foxconn as a key supplier will continue benefiting from the Apple partnership. Foxconn's other customers, such as Sony and Amazon, are probably not going to disappear. Even if they do, some of their competitors will likely take their place. Of course, the short-term shock from losing Apple's business would be significant, and margins would likely be hurt, so this is clearly a major risk. Foxconn realizes this, of course, and has been trying to diversify away by expanding sales to counterbalance Apple's gargantuan size. Lower-end Chinese smartphone makers, such as Xiaomi and Huawei, contributed to a surge in Y/Y earnings at FIH Mobile, which is partially owned by Hon Hai and assembles phones and provides other products and services for non-Apple brand owners. India is one of the fastest (sometimes the fastest) growing countries in the world in terms of the GDP. Unlike most developed countries and lately China, India has a very favorable population curve that is not aging as much as other economies. India is an over-billion-people market where almost all citizens speak English in addition to their local language or dialect, and the country has relatively central government policies and rules, as well as a common currency. In short, the Indian market has huge potential to become the fastest growing economy in the next 10 years. Its proximity to China means lots of cheaper manufacturing will move from India to China, as labor costs in China continue rising relentlessly. Therefore, it's no coincidence that Foxconn's expansion plans focus on India. For example, the company is planning to build up to 12 new factories and employ up to 1M workers in India by 2020 as one alternative to cope with rising Chinese wages and labor disputes. Another alternative is to employ more of its robots. Foxconn is also partnering with Indian companies to achieve the goal, for example with Adani Enterprises . Foxconn's other endeavors in India include a plan to invest $1B into India's startups, as well as its deal to purchase a $0.5B stake in Snapdeal . Foxconn will also co-invest alongside SoftBank and Bharti for a total $20B into Indian solar energy . In short, Foxconn is strategically becoming so much more than the largest electronics factory of the world. In addition to the initiatives mentioned above, Foxconn also has ventures in telecommunication services in Taiwan, retail business in China and its own e-commerce platform. Foxconn will become a R&D, technology and services powerhouse but current services sales are still too small to make a big impact In 2014, Foxconn has continued to accelerate its technical development by obtaining 1,537 patents, ranking it the 18th highest in the world. The company is also strategically moving more and more toward smart manufacturing, utilizing big data technology to understand and anticipate end-user demand, improving the production volume planning. Foxconn also strives to shorten the manufacturing time and chain by moving toward all-in-one solutions, integrating manufacturing services and e-commerce to the process. Due to its large sales volume, R&D expenses comprise only roughly 1% of sales. While the lion's share of Foxconn's revenue is driven by the products category, which has been growing by single digits, the services segment has almost tripled Y/Y between 2013 and 2014, showing the company's future focus. However, the services segment still accounts for only roughly 3% of the company's overall sales, so this is a long-distance run. Rage against the machines all over again Foxconn is at the front of the next stage in the global manufacturing, assembly and logistics revolution, in which robots and AI will be replacing many human jobs. This will be a structural change similar in magnitude and impact as the 18th century industrialization and the resulting "rage against the machines" movement. Foxconn's goals to have 1M robots working for it by this year have proven too ambitious (in part due to labor groups backlash against human labor cuts), but Foxconn's own factories are churning out 10,000 robots per year that are then used in the company's manufacturing process. And the company is also preparing to market these robots to other manufacturers. In short, Foxconn is the largest assembly line in the world by most criteria, and is now at the edge of becoming also a leader in the industrial robots area, which will be in high demand due to cost savings and efficiency it brings to the manufacturing process. Simply put, Foxconn is a company to own for the long run. The short-term headwinds are creating a solid buying opportunity. Most recent sales numbers from September show rising sales in U.S. dollar terms H2 sales are crucial for Foxconn as they are seasonally very strong, especially the Q4 sales. With several Apple product refreshes and releases being recently announced, sales should do relatively well in the second half of 2015. September sales have shown a ~11% Y/Y sales growth in Taiwan Dollar terms. Apple's numbers will be crucial to watch, of course. For the 9 months year-to-date, Foxconn's sales are ~12.5% higher Y/Y in local currency terms. Given the average level of Taiwanese dollar vs. the U.S. dollar is roughly 6.7% lower Y/Y at the end of September, the U.S. dollar YTD sales growth rate in U.S. dollar terms seems to be around 5.8%, with the cautionary note that the recent months have shown much lower rates of growth. Foxconn trades at a P/S of 0.32, TTM P/E and forward P/E below 9x. The company's FCF generation ability has been at least on par with the net earnings, so Foxconn trades at ~9x forward P/FCF. My base case assumptions in a DCF valuation are a very modest 3% CAGR in sales and FCF for the next 10 years (below global GDP growth and well below the emerging markets growth), followed by zero terminal growth rates. I am also assuming just 3.0% FCFE margins and a 10% equity discount rate. Even under these conservative assumptions, Foxconn is undervalued by ~15%, with the midpoint of its intrinsic value at ~$101.64 per Taiwan-listed share, which currently trades at ~TWD 88 per share. I used recent depreciation levels as a guide for sustainable future FCF and because current capital expenditures are low and underestimate the long-term needs required to sustain the current earnings power and earnings growth. The company often uses acquisitions to grow, so lumpy capex in the short run is not surprising and is nothing of concern, especially given the company's zero net debt. Should Foxconn manage to grow at its recent historical growth rate of 7% p.a., the company has a much more attractive 49% upside, assuming a 10% equity discount rate. Foxconn's average interest rate on all of its debt seems to be well below 2%, with the average duration when issued of roughly five years, ranging from two years to 10 years. The company has zero net long-term debt and has a solid net cash pile available, equal to ~15% of annual sales. This financial power provides room for further expansion to boost growth. Since growth priced in is very low, any speed-up would offer a significantly higher upside. Hon Hai's Chairman Terry Gou (Gou, Tai-ming) owns more than a 12% stake at the company, showing a strong long-term commitment and strategy continuity (He had been first elected 40 years ago!) More than 50% of Foxconn sales come from a single customer: Apple. The development of the share shows that Apple's share has been increasing, and with Apple's new product releases announced very recently, this share could temporarily increase. There is a large one-time risk that Apple will announce a plan to switch major portions of its products to a different manufacturer. With Foxconn's margins already razor-thin, the incentive to switch to another manufacturer entirely are not that high compared to the hassle. However, a gradual diversification of manufacturers is part of Apple's strategy, so there is a relevant probability that Foxconn's share of Apple's total production might gradually fall. In case of a catastrophic loss of 50% of sales (entire Apple), Foxconn's shares have a ~40% downside from the current price, which is a clear risk to the bullish thesis. The drive to be the biggest at all costs could cause continuous stock dilution and low margins Foxconn has been growing fast, and it has not shielding away to use stock and debt issuance to speed up the expansion, usually issuing shares to acquire companies. While debt issuance might be seen as mere optimization of the capital structure in light of growing sales and balance sheet, stock issuance has been clearly dilutive. Hopefully, the high insider stake of over 12% will protect shareholders from excessive stock dilution without corresponding earnings increase. Hon Hai (Foxconn) is not a simple investment theme for the short-term oriented investors. There are many moving parts and risks, such as Apple's future performance and its potential diversification from Foxconn, the currency devaluation wars in the APAC region, and even the China-Taiwan political and military relations risks. However, the current China weakness and Apple's possible peak of the cycle, together with a substantial Taiwanese dollar devaluation, created an ideal opportunity to buy Hon Hai at a solid discount. The current price of ~TWD $88 per share (local currency) prices in almost no future growth while Foxconn has been diversifying from Apple and venturing into new growth areas such as industrial robots, India, e-commerce, and many others. At a 3% FCF CAGR in the next 10 years followed by flat FCF, Foxconn offers a ~15% upside. If growth remains close to recent historical numbers around the 7% growth rate, the stock has a ~50% upside. In any case, Foxconn should be viewed as a long-term investment with double-digit annual price growth potential, but also with its risks.
