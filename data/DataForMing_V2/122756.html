AT&T To Overtake Verizon? Or Simply A Bad Connection? - AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) | Seeking Alpha Telecommunications companies are preparing for auction in 2016. T should see marginal immediate growth but will outpace competition with extended growth opportunities. It's going to be a big week for the telecommunications industry as two giants prepare to unveil their second quarter results. While most investors might anticipate that earlier reporting Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) will maintain their rough parity over competitor AT&T (NYSE: T ), it seems that the latter's report on Thursday (after markets close) may have a surprise or two in store. For most of recent memory, Verizon has more or less dominated the telecom market, a fact that has not changed in the wake of increased wireless network sales. With another auction planned by the FCC in 2016 (and the anticipated valuation at $44.9 billion), it seems that VZ might be well placed to snap up and continue to control the market. You wouldn't know it based on the last 8 quarters, but AT&T is ramping up to outpace Verizon in both sales as well as stock performance. Though this may not mean as much when looking at the past two years, the last three months begin to suggest a different story. As of the time of writing, T is projected to grow average sales levels faster than its larger rival for at least the next two years (and then some), an opportunity driven by its possible acquisition of Mexican telecommunication market opportunities . (I refer to acquisitions of Nextel de Mexico and Gurpo Iusacelli in February of this year.) Though the move has not yet borne its anticipated fruit, the additional access to 40 million potential customers cannot be underestimated, and with more investment expected in the country, even a moderately successful venture will bear fruit. Less widespread than an entire country, T is looking into more extensive domestic contracts as well. In Kansas for example, the company has recently won a statewide contract to update the emergency services network to integrate cloud communications into all currently existing materials to improve processing and dispatch efforts. For the last two quarters AT&T has managed to beat earnings expectations from Wall Street, though this EPS is, in and of itself, not a massively sweeping success. Similarly, Thursday's report should not be excessively surprising, with earnings remaining in the area of $.63 a share. Revenues themselves should see a slight increase from the first quarter 2015, still looking to recover from a bumper fourth quarter late last year. Numbers should also manage to beat last year quarter's numbers, albeit by a comparatively slim margin. If estimates are where they are currently expected, than T should be reporting values in excess of $33 billion in revenue. All in all, financials do indicate only moderate growth in the immediate short term. But investors would be wise to consider the long term moves being made by an AT&T that seems to be wiring itself for the future. Source: AT&T To Overtake Verizon? Or Simply A Bad Connection?
