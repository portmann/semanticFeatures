Ford: Proof That F-150 Demand Is Still Robust - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Demand for the F-150 has been in question over the last two weeks, after reports of incentivized selling of "up to" $10,000 off F-150 was being offered. We quickly debunked that mostly misleading headline in an article out yesterday and presented our case for why we think Ford will be fine. This morning's news of a new luxury F-150 confirms that there is robust demand above current price points for Ford's F-150. We wrote an article yesterday about why we thought that the panic about Ford's (NYSE: F ) incentive pricing on its F-150 was overblown and why the pricing actually went on to support our bull case for the company. This morning, news was released that supports our rebuttal and supports the notion that F-150 sales are healthy, thereby firming up this leg of our bull case. Ford has been trying to push the luxury element of its business, especially outside of the United States. The company has done well in projecting the Lincoln line as luxury vehicles outside of the U.S. and now it looks as if Ford is going to try and combine the rugged tough guy "Ford tough" image of its pickup trucks with a bit of luxury. This morning, Ford announced that they're going to be offering a new "top of the line" F-150 that sits above the "Platinum" version of its truck (which is currently the most expensive offering). The new truck will come in over $60,000 and will help push ASP up significantly for Ford. Some people are apparently luxury truck buyers. Wired described them as "the ability to haul a 10,000 pound horse trailer without giving up the finer things in life." Here, from Ford's website , you can see the higher end models that the company currently offers. The new model would usurp the Platinum as the high end model. One thing is for sure here; Ford wouldn't be taking the time to make this model if they weren't confident it would sell. The company must be seeing encouraging data from the Platinum model to support this. After all, the company's ASP for an F-150 (as we stated yesterday) is $44,000. This falls toward the higher end of all models offered (we cut out the economy models from the above screen shot). If you recall from our article out yesterday, one of the points we made defending the F-150 was that the average price of a F-150 rolling off the lot told a very different story than some incentives that were being offered. The addition of this higher end F-150 to the company's line of already existing trucks shows us that there's demand for a very expensive pickup truck. It's at direct odds with the bearish thoughts a couple weeks ago, which basically amounted to "the F-150 has to get cheaper for anyone to buy it". With the F-150 a key component of our long thesis, we are happy to see this news today and are happier for what it will do for Ford's margin and ASP heading into future quarters. As we debunked yesterday, the $10,000 incentive figure is nonsense. Only in certain parts of the country, while taking advantage of all available potential configurations and options, is this available. The company is not hacking off $10,000 from every F-150, despite what the headlines make it look like. The company says the average incentive is just $3,100; big difference. Today's luxury addition tells us just the opposite is happening; demand must be robust. This news comes on the back of positive European sales numbers reported earlier this month. Ford registrations were up 16% YOY to 103,450 units and EU registrations were up 14.8% YOY. The company gained market share, moving to 7.3% from 7.2% in the year prior period.
