Keep Riding Verizon Despite The Recent Performance - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha Verizon has underperformed the broader market for the last two years. It looks like investors are holding on for dividends. I built a three-scenario DCF model to see how the company may perform in years to come based on various growth and margin scenarios. My findings made me issue a BUY recommendation on the stock with an upside opportunity of ~10% even in the worst-case scenario. Like many other telecom stocks, Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) has been having a bad year, especially given the market turbulence in August-September: Note: the stock's price returns are compared to S&P 500 Index's performance and returns of Telus Corporation (NYSE: TU ), Deutsche Telekom AG, Sprint (NYSE: S ), Rogers Communications (NYSE: RCI ), and AT&T (NYSE: T ). I chose these companies because they either operate in the same market and/or have similar market capitalizations. Fundamentally, the company has been doing much better: revenues have grown by almost 20% over the past five years, while operating income has increased by over 23%, which shows that there is a degree of successfully implemented operating leverage. In terms of free cash flows, the company has maintained the FCFF yield in the mid-teens, albeit the figures have been volatile over the years. What is more important that Verizon has produced free cash flows in excess of dividends and share buybacks. This shows that the company's shareholder compensation activities are well-funded. The company's debt levels have more than doubled in the past five years: from ~$53B to ~$114B. Although this may seem disadvantageous to the company risk profile, the multiple of debt-to-EBITDA has only increased from about 1.6x to 3.2x. With an interest coverage ratio of ~4.0x, Verizon is well-prepared for the debt levels. However, what interests investors more is how the company will likely perform in years to come. This is why I build discounted cash flow analyses for all my research articles. Verizon is no exception. Verizon's DCF model has three scenarios built-in: a Base Scenario (~4.3% CAGR in revenues in the next five years, a constant 30.3% EBITDA margin, and a 10% discount rate), a Bull Case (5.5% CAGR in the top line, an increasing EBITDA margin to 32% in 2020, and a 10% discount rate), and a Stress Case (3.5% CAGR in revenues, a declining EBITDA margin to 28%, and a 10% discount rate). The model's Base Scenario's output is provided below (see the rest in the model): Note: the percentages indicate a downside move in the share price from the Thursday's close of $42.84 required for the stock to reach the fair value range. I used an 8.0x EBITDA multiple in the model above. This may seem high in absolute terms, but before we jump to conclusions, let us see how the model's multiple is comparable to historical data: The above illustration shows the dynamics of Verizon's EV/EBITDA multiple over the last seven quarters (i.e. almost two years). There seems to be a considerable increase in the multiple in the spring of this year (from 6.0x to 8.0x). Note that EBITDA have been constantly increasing, while the stock's market price actually declined by about 10% since the end of March. Hence, the increase in the multiple is not associated with the company's operating performance or the market dynamics of its stock. I analyzed the numbers more deeply and found out that the reason is an increase in debt and a decrease in the cash balance (in short, Enterprise Value = Market Capitalization + Total Debt - Cash). This means that the current multiple of 8.0x is not an outlier in terms of market data. (Source: Capital IQ.

Compiled by author) The historical and the comparable companies' data show that the multiple chosen in the valuation model is fair and more or less conservative. Now that we know what the stock's fair value is, we can derive a reasonable price target range based on a desired rate of return (10%): I issue a BUY recommendation on the shares of Verizon Inc. with a target price range of $58 - $65 per share in the next twelve months, which implies a 30%-50% upside potential in the next 12-24 months. Keep in mind that, even in the most pessimistic scenario I considered, the stock is worth considerably more than what the market is currently offering for it. My calculations show that investors skeptical about the company's perspectives should still expect the stock to increase by at least 10% in the next twelve months. Finally, the stock is currently offering a 5%+ dividend yield, which should compensate for the opportunity cost. In fact, I analyzed the last five years' worth of dividends and found out that Verizon has been able to cover both dividends and buybacks and have a substantial portion of cash "leftovers" by the end of each fiscal period: (Source: Capital IQ. Calculations by author) This table shows that the stock is a BUY for dividend investors because the company has been generating sufficient cash flows to compensate shareholders without the detriment to the company's long-term value.
