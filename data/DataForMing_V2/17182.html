Apple Could Go Down In The Class Struggle - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple is setting up a special retail experience for buyers of its $10,000 Edition Watch. Apple has spent a lot of money bringing in luxury goods experts to remake its in-store experience. Will the class struggle take the Watch down? Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), which currently has a reputation for never putting a foot wrong (something it decidedly did not have in mid-2013, when the stock was less than half the price it is now) could well be stepping into that struggle with the Apple Watch. The Watch is the first new category opened by the company since the death of co-founder Steve Jobs, and a lot is riding on its success. How much of the company's current $717 billion in market cap depends on the Watch isn't clear, given that the Price/Earnings multiple on the stock is still close to that of the market at 16.6, but it's clear volatility could easily return if the watch is a failure. The problem isn't with the standard $350 retail Watch. It's with the $10,000 "Edition" version. To bring in the swells, Apple is breaking the middle class ambience of its own stores, adding a private room, and bumping such purchasers to the front of the line. Such buyers are also getting two years of phone support on a dedicated line. Ever since the high-end bling was announced I had been wondering how they would get of it to the market, whether it was, in fact, a joke. It's not a joke. Having hired top executives from Burberry, Louis Vuitton and Yves St. Laurent, Apple is creating a "store within a store" to go after the people who normally buy from Tiffany (NYSE: TIF ). Anyone who has ever gone inside an Apple Store knows that such places are crowded and solidly middle class. By making some pigs more equal than others, in Orwell's words, Apple is breaking what had been a covenant with its customers. Many of Apple's traditional buyers are choking on a price tag of $350 for something that requires at least an iPhone 5 to work. Now the believers who manage, through dint and sweat, to get up that money are going to watch some airhead who never cared about Apple before going up to the front of the line and inside a special room to get what you spent hours on a line trying to see? How is that not going to stir resentment, exactly? Apple shares peaked in mid-to-late February at a price near $130, and are currently hovering around $124, waiting to see how the Watch will do when it's launched on April 24. (Apple will also announce first quarter earnings on April 22, a few days earlier.) Any valuation of the shares, between now and some weeks after April 24, will be highly speculative, based mainly on anecdotal information. It's now clear that Apple is serious about trying to turn its consumer electronics into bling. What do the speculators say to that?
