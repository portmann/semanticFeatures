ESPN subscriber losses spur debate: Where's the bottom? - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha To screen ETFs by asset class, performance, yield and more, check out the ETF Hub. ETF Hub Nov 24 2015, 19:28 ET | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Disney ( DIS -1.2%) kicked off a great media debate this summer by pointing to (and then deflecting criticism about ) declining subscriber numbers at ESPN, its flagship sports network. Since then, some analysts have joined in with CEO Bob Iger in suggesting that reactions were overdone. Hedge fund manager Eric Jackson disagrees, suggesting the numbers may have a bigger drop ahead . He points to SEC filings in suggesting that ESPN subscribers peaked at 99M in 2013, vs. a Nielsen estimate of 92M today -- which comes with a corresponding drop in affiliate fees for one of the richest channels in subscriber cost. With ESPN getting an estimated $6.60 per core subscriber each month, Jackson figures the network is getting $650M less in affiliate revenues and $250M less in advertising -- close to $1B less in just two years. Open questions: whether the decline in subscribers will remain steady or if it's already moderating, and what the effect will be if ESPN goes over-the-top (as the company is testing with DisneyLife in the UK).

I can hardly stand watching football on local network TV which I now get OTA.   Understandably, it's free and supported by adverts but within the past 10 years the adverts have become outrageous - loud, annoying and just about every play is following by a dose of "let's dumb down America further.". Now, ESPN is loaded with adverts too. If Disney wants to keep subscribers it would be prudent that they give them premium content without all the crap adverts and headaches that comes with regular, free, OTA NFL and other sports. Cable - the joke is on the subscriber as it once was an advet free Zone - now cable subscribers pay for their content and STILL get subjected to advert after advert.   The greed of the network owners and providers have dug their own demise. ESPN might not struggle so much if it didn't become the eSECn. I know lots of sports fans can't stand their lovefest with the SEC conference and their favoritism towards their teams. I for one try to support Fox Sports 1 because my team is in the Big 12, which espn barely mentions.
