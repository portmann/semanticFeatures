Snapchat CEO: 'We need to IPO' - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha May 27 2015, 02:07 ET | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel has revealed plans for an IPO, but said he has no desire to field any acquisitions offers - like Facebook's (NASDAQ: FB ) $3B bid for the company nearly two years ago. Spiegel’s comments, coming at the Code Conference in California, were the first time he publicly acknowledged the possibility of an IPO. He stopped short of saying when the company, most recently valued at $15B, might try to go public. He needs to start considering striking while the iron is hot. It's a crowded field and new players getting in every week SpaceX is worth ~ $20B, and Snapchat is worth around $15B? I know I'm comparing orange and banana, but it's just ridiculous! I, myself, tried (and failed) at least 2 web start-ups, and this is how I interpret Spiegel: We need to IPO because we cannot find enough money to keep this damn thing running, we don't make much money out of it. Air isn't a power supply, and we don't know any other sustainable source! Good luck throwing your money away VCs!
