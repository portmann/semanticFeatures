Warren Buffett Buys Apple, One Of Two Things Buffett Is Doing That He Doesn't Do - Berkshire Hathaway inc. (NYSE:BRK.B) | Seeking Alpha  |  About: Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRK.A) , DLR , GCI , TPUB , BRK.B , Includes: AAPL , ALK , AMZN , ANAC , BBCN , CPGX , ETE , FDX , GG , IBM , KGC , KLAC , KMKGF , KNCRY , LRCX , MITL , MRD , PFE , PLCM , RRC , SHW , SPY , TEX , TNTEY , TRP , TUMI , TWC , UBER , VA , VAL , WIBC , WMB , YHOO Warren Buffett does not bid in auctions. With the relatively recent exception of IBM (NYSE: IBM ), Warren Buffett does not invest in technology. Yet he is doing both of those things by financing a bid for Yahoo!'s (NASDAQ: YHOO ) internet assets as part of a group along with Quicken Loans founder Dan Gilbert. Perhaps Buffett's previously long-held views were softened by working with Yahoo! on live streaming the recent Berkshire Hathaway ( BRK.A , BRK.B ) annual meeting. Buffett is bidding on assets worth between $4 and $8 billion (he is likely making an offer on the low end of that range). Perhaps Buffett is losing his shyness around tech - he recently bumped up his stake in IBM and bought $900 million of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). The whole world admires the achievements of Apple. On the other hand, you could hardly think of another business that is more un-Berkshire-like than Apple. We really hate trying to invent whole new, novel technologies, one after another. We wouldn't be as good at it as Apple is. So we're not trying to out-Apple Apple. Gannett (NYSE: GCI ) bumped its cash offer to acquire Tribune Publishing (NYSE: TPUB ) from $12.25 per share to $15 per share. I expected a bump to $14 but prefer $15. Pfizer (NYSE: PFE ) is buying Anacor (NASDAQ: ANAC ) in a $5.2 billion cash deal. ANAC holders get $99.25 per share. Range Resources (NYSE: RRC ) is buying Memorial Resource (NASDAQ: MRD ) in a $4.4 billion stock deal. MRD holders get 0.375 RRC per share. Terex (NYSE: TEX ) agreed with Konecranes ( OTCPK:KNCRY ) to mutually terminate their existing merger agreement. Terex agreed to sell its Material Handling and Port Solutions business to Konecranes for $1.3 billion of cash and stock. This is a great deal for both parties. Konecranes will be better off with the new deal and Terex is still free to sell the remaining business to the high bidder. Williams (NYSE: WMB ) filed an action in the Delaware Court of Chancery to block Energy Transfer (NYSE: ETE ) from terminating or otherwise avoiding its obligations under the merger agreement. Digital Realty (NYSE: DLR ) will replace Time Warner Cable (NYSE: TWC ) in the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA: SPY ) after the close on Tuesday, May 17. Lam (NASDAQ: LRCX ) and KLA-Tencor (NASDAQ: KLAC ) received a second request from the DOJ regarding their merger. They received regulatory clearance from Germany, Ireland, Israel and Taiwan. BBCN (NASDAQ: BBCN ) filed its second amendment to the S-4 regarding its acquisition of Wilshire (NASDAQ: WIBC ). Upon completion, the company will be named Hope Bancorp. Meh. Tumi (NYSE: TUMI ) filed an amended version of the preliminary proxy for its acquisition by Samsonite ( OTCPK:SMSOF ) ( OTCPK:SMSEY ). Samsonite executed a credit agreement and funding of Term Loan B tranche into escrow to pay for the deal. The preliminary S-4 was filed for the Mitel (NASDAQ: MITL ) acquisition of Polycom (NASDAQ: PLCM ).
