Yahoo's NFL Deal Is A Mistake - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha Yahoo will livestream a NFL game in October. This is a terrible London matchup in a bad time slot. The National Football League wanted to try something new this year by livestreaming a game online for free. On Wednesday, we heard that Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) won the bidding for this game, with a purchase price that's reported to be over $20 million. While the NFL is the giant of the US sports industry currently, I really don't believe this deal provides any long-term potential for Yahoo. First, the matchup is between the Buffalo Bills and Jacksonville Jaguars, two of the league's smaller markets. Both of these teams are expected to be middle of the pack at best, and neither of them have been really good in recent years. Additionally, since the game is in London, it will be airing at 9:30 AM Eastern, and 6:30 AM Pacific. I don't think a lot of West Coast fans will be getting up for a game that doesn't involve their teams. Even on the East Coast, the timing conflicts with church and other Sunday morning activities during the fall. If a big market team was involved, you might be able to make a strong case for viewership, but not with these teams. The second issue I see is that it is a lose-lose scenario. If things don't go well, Yahoo looks foolish. If things do go well, then the NFL will probably try to do something again on a larger scale, and at a much larger price tag. As detailed in the market current linked in my opening, a slate of Thursday night games becomes available next year. It was reported that CBS (NYSE: CBS ) paid $275 million last year when it bought 8 Thursday games. With the NFL's popularity and content prices soaring, you're probably looking at a $300 million to $400 million per year investment for an 8 game package. I just don't see that in Yahoo's long-term strategy, not for a company whose operating income was just $142 million last year . These games are more suited for a big network with deep pockets, one that already has the production infrastructure in place and has done this before. Plus, I don't see Yahoo trying to outbid one of the larger networks for a sports package like this. One game is a different story. Yahoo recently lost out on the bidding to Hulu, perhaps the third biggest streaming service currently, and that was for a deal of TV shows worth about $180 million. If Yahoo wasn't willing to go towards $200 million on that deal, I don't know if you can expect it to pay about twice that a year for just for a handful of football games. In the end, I just don't see this NFL deal being very important for Yahoo. The league is using a poor matchup across the pond as a test subject, with Yahoo being the guinea pig to determine if this is an effort worth expanding in the future. One article I read that likes the deal projects a potential $13 million loss for Yahoo when factoring in all costs, which is a real stinker. Even if this one game effort goes well, I just don't see Yahoo ponying up a huge amount of change for future games when the NFL can actually put decent games in a package for hundreds of millions of dollars per year.
