Boeing In Free-Fall Or Flying Free? - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Near future moves could allow the company to soar higher, including the recent change in leadership. A small concern for down the road could be seen in the international packaging standards for lithium, echoing concerns raised by the company itself. Boeing (NYSE: BA ) has seen its share of newstime recently, though the timing of this amount of ink seems to underscore the energy behind the aeronautics company. As the company prepares for its earnings report (due out this coming Wednesday before the markets open), there are a few things that need to be heard before the company reports. Financially speaking, the company is in a good place, expecting in excess of $24 billion in revenues, a safe increase of $2 billion over last year quarter's $22.05 billion. Given that the quarter over quarter increase keeps the company on rough parity with historical revenue performance while continuing to trend up, this should give potential investors a breath of fresh air when there have been concerns about the aeronautics industry. One could feel a measure of concern that the revenue streams over the last two years are slanting towards volatility, but the fact that the trend remains positive is an excellent sign for the company's future. EPS is a tad bit underperforming comparative to last year's numbers, though this underperformance can be traced roughly to the aforementioned industry concerns. Specifically, early estimates expect EPS to be in the range of $2.14, down about a quarter from last year. However, BA also generally posts an EPS beat (or at least has over the last two years). In several cases (including last year's surprise over $2.40 per), the mark has been exceeded by a safe, large amount. Considering near potential moves for the company, Wednesday's report should be nothing but good news. With Boeing heavily integrated into the defense apparatus of the United States as well as civilian aviation, new proposed government contracts could see the stock (already trading in the high 140's) soar higher. Couple the fact as well that Dennis Mullenburg has just taken the reins from James McNerney as CEO, with the former COO slimming the company down while looking to maintain current productive efficiency. There is a small amount of odd news coming from Boeing in the form of concerns over lithium battery transportation. Though the current international packaging standards seem to have this particular concern under control, the fact that Boeing has remarked on the situation could mean that the company will be seeking tougher regulations in the near future. While the initial effects will not be felt even into the second half of this fiscal year, the possibility remains that Boeing will see some additional costs on the bottom line that force a reorganization. All in all the immediate future remains bright for Boeing, and price targets currently posted in the area of $160 support the solid truth that BA continues to be a great investment pick.
