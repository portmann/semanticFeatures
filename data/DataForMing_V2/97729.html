Netflix: Forward Stock Split Is A Waiting Game, Not A Buying Opportunity - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha The Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) announcement made me be happy. The small investor can finally buy the stock at an affordable price. However, it is best to wait. I will take a look at Netflix's previous split and a few of the companies and the typical behavior that occurs before the split and after the split. The image above is NetFlix's first stock split. What does this image show us? It shows us that the hype of the split ran the price of the stock up. Afterwards the stock sold off. Had you entered into a position in Netflix's stock, you would have most likely been frustrated. It is better to wait and be patient because price will not immediately take off and leave you behind. According to a passage from the book , Stock Market Logic: a Sophisticated Approach to Profits on Wall Street, "one of the great popular myths on the Street is that stock splits are usually followed by dynamic upside price movements." In addition, William O'Neil of investors business daily has noted that investors should be alert if excessive stock splits come after huge price advances. In fact, the big players and institutions such as mutual funds may be using this opportunity to sell off. Though he mentions it for constant stock splits. I believe his words are still wise and applicable to all stock splitting scenarios. Prior to the split, the stock had a rapid rise. After the split, that's not the case. The stock did not rise quickly as most would believe. In fact, it was in consolidation of a couple of weeks before slowly rising. Prior to the split there was a run up in Under Armour's stock price. After the split there was a minor sell off, then a steady increase in price. Now, let me direct you to a study performed by David Ikenberry of UIUC. His study debunked a lot of myths regarding stock splits. In essence, for a similarly sized company, a stock performs better post-split than if it hadn't not split at all. This is over a one- to three-year period. Why does this behavior occur? There are a couple of reasons. It's mostly boils down to perception and psychology which manifests themselves physically. Companies will often report high earnings and raise dividends at the same time they announce a stock split. The synergy of these events can drive the price of the stock up even more. Many investors, especially the smaller ones, buy after the split because they feel they are getting a lower price, and this tends to drive the price of the post-split stock higher. So, stock splits are not just smoke and mirrors. They actually had value to the long-term shareholder. Below, I have included a table of the phases. There is the pre announcement phase, but I have disregarded that as most people become aware of the stock when the split announcement occurs. Pay attention to what happens in each phase, especially the post split row. After the split, profit taking begins. This is exactly what William O'Neil warned about and can be visually seen in the prior examples. Time and time again this behavior occurs. So, before you rush in to purchase Netflix, remember the institutions are smarter than you are. Be patient and you will not fall into the exuberance trap that occurs with the upcoming Netflix stock split.
