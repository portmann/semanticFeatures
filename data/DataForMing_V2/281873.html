Apple Rumors, I Bought Skyworks; Short Nigeria? - Bezek's Daily Briefing | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I am/we are short EWZ, VXX, UVXY. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. Apple's down on rumors. I'm taking a swing long with Skyworks. Tuesday wasn't a terribly interesting day for the markets. The markets initially dipped as uneasiness from Monday continued to percolate. But with another face-saving late-day rally, the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA: SPY ) pulled out a mildly positive close. The Nasdaq (NASDAQ: QQQ ), weighed down by Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) rumors, couldn't quite get it to green for the day. More on that in a second. One thing that receded nicely was volatility (NYSEARCA: VXX ) (NYSEARCA: UVXY ), which was down another 3% on Tuesday despite the flat markets. Volatility got hugely bid up the past few days with the strong post-Christmas selloff. Then, it faded 5% in the closing hour on Monday and dropped hard again on Tuesday. I was short VXX calls over the holiday weekend. Traditionally, markets rally to start the new year, and the first week usually features heavy money inflows that ensure flat or up markets. At one point Monday, my calls, which I was short, were up 175% against me. Two lessons from this. One, if you are trading volatility, keep your position sizes small. You never know when a market which is supposed to be up will suddenly swan dive. With volatility, if you have the margin and the stomach to wait it out, mean reversion occurs sooner or later - almost always sooner. The calls I sold, which were way against me at the worst of it on Monday, are already back to break even and will likely close the week with a nice profit (assuming this latest Chinese mess, which is developing as I edit this on Tuesday evening, blows over). Shorting volatility is a great long-term business, but you must use prudent position sizing, unexpected moves like Monday or last August will eventually wipe out the greedy trader who overleverages. On the flip side, this latest volatility event shows the futility of trying to go long volatility in a bull market. Even with numerous bearish catalysts, volatility still recedes rapidly. VXX and especially UVXY are so poorly designed that it takes a near-miraculous series of conditions for anything longer than a day trade on these names to be profitable. If you need to hedge your portfolio, there are much more responsible ways to do so. The Briefing frequently discusses more profitable short-selling opportunities to protect your portfolio from sell-offs. Look at this chart of UVXY. You'd think with the S&P spilling back under 2,000 there for a minute, volatility would have gotten back to somewhere near the highs from August, right? Nope, UVXY could hardly get off its 52-week low. Anyone who bought UVXY up in the $70s or $80s at the height of the panic last summer has a huge permanent capital loss that even an 800-point decline in the Dow recently couldn't come close to remedying. Volatility futures were at 13 when UVXY launched its spike in August. We're at 19.50 today on the futures. A drop from 19.50 back to 13 today would cause it to lose at least half its value from today's close. It may look like UVXY has done alright since August, but that's only because the market is now pricing in 50% more volatility than six months ago. If all those negative predictions for 2016 don't come to fruition, UVXY will trade in the single digits (or reverse split again) by the time summer rolls around. A report came out on Tuesday suggesting that Apple component orders for the iPhone 6 line of products would be 30% below original forecasts. That sounded really bad, and the shares got hit hard, falling almost 3% on the day. The shares continued to sell off further after-hours. If the report is true, look out below for Apple shares. With other products such as the iPod, iPad, and iTunes having seen better days, the Apple ship is firmly tied to the iPhone. If the iPhone has finally peaked and enters its decline, the company's shares are likely to go with it. It's not that uncommon for tech companies with declining market share/declining markets to trade at sub-10 P/E ratios for long periods of time. Look at a history of Dell, HP, and other such former high fliers to see how this goes. The phrase "value trap" is used liberally in such accounts. The iPhone has been on unsteady ground for a while now, and with it looking like the 7 isn't going to be transformative, there's no great reason for optimism. The bull case for Apple seems to consist of pointing to the cash pile, the P/E, and then saying the word "undervalued" repeatedly. In other words, put me in the "value trap" camp in regard to Apple shares. Still, a 30% decline in orders seems a bit steep, and as the day went on, it emerged that the news source reporting the story isn't widely known. Furthermore, it appears that the 30% decline account wasn't based on concrete sources. The story, in fact, appears to belong more in the rumor than the news pile. I've watched too many friends burn too much money chasing "cheap" tech stocks with declining markets that continued to get "cheaper" for years on end. I even made the same error myself, suggesting BlackBerry (NASDAQ: BBRY ) was cheap in the $20s years ago. It was way down from its peak and looked cheap on a P/E basis, but obviously, the bottom was nowhere near. Needless to say, I'm not going long Apple. Without innovation, the company will at best be dead money. Its suppliers interest me, though. The semiconductor space was hit hard on Tuesday as Apple suppliers got hit. What's bad for the goose is also negative for the gander. Skyworks (NASDAQ: SWKS ) seems like the easiest play on the trade. Its stock has been pounded recently, it was faring poorly even before Tuesday's 6% decline on the Apple rumors. My friend and fellow Seeking Alpha contributor SevenSeas Investment Research has been covering the Skyworks story, and he remains guardedly optimistic on the company despite the recent sell-off. See his lengthy update from Tuesday afternoon. He astutely notes that Skyworks has a strong position with rising smartphone stars Huawei and Xiaomi. Additionally, the company has a great balance sheet and other irons in the fire, including Internet of Things, smart home, and auto. Skyworks looks optically cheap enough that the downside should be fairly limited, and it could enjoy a swift bounce if the 30% Apple reduction rumors turn out to be false. I expect the market to rally over the coming weeks, and this looks like a good way to get tech exposure. Nigeria: Inept Government Sinking The Economy. Should We Be Short? As the seemingly solitary booster of Colombia here at Seeking Alpha, I must admit one of my personal shortcomings is getting miffed when other, weaker emerging markets get tons of positive press. Nigeria (NYSEARCA: NGE ) scored 8 positive articles in 2015 here at Seeking Alpha, while the Global X MSCI Colombia ETF (NYSEARCA: GXG ) got only 2. It makes my Colombia trade stronger - I'm driving an almost entirely empty bandwagon after all. But after a while, you end up feeling like the Israelites cursed to 40 years of wandering through the desert alone. Even feeble markets like Nigeria can still get respect, and Colombia gets nothing. As you can see, Nigeria (blue line) and Colombia (orange line) enjoyed similar fates in 2015. Nigeria even outperformed, which was especially odd when you consider the following: Nigeria gets more than 90% of export dollars from oil (NYSEARCA: USO ), compared to less than half being petro-based in Colombia. It is way more corrupt than Colombia. Colombia is an investment-grade credit. Nigeria is deep into the junk tiers. Colombia is the 28th best country in which to do business in the world. Nigeria is outside the top 100. I could go on, but there's simply no comparison. Whenever I chimed in on a Nigeria article saying, Colombia is a better market on every conceivable metric, people generally declined to respond to my claim. I assumed some sort of investing affirmative action was at work to include African investments in people's portfolios. However, the true reason why Nigeria's market hasn't collapsed yet was made apparent in a (long overdue) bearish article on the country's ETF yesterday here at Seeking Alpha. As it would turn out, Nigeria's government, no warrior for free market principles, has been drastically manipulating its currency. SA author Lucas Zimmerman writes: Currently the Naira is officially fixed at a rate of 197 Naira per USD and has been for several months now. To find the real value of the Naira, we will have to go to the parallel (black) market, where the rate is 270 Naira per USD. Why the huge divergence? The government refuses to devalue the Naira and has set a fixed exchange rate since early 2015, tightened liquidity and heavily depleted the Central Bank of Nigeria's foreign exchange reserves to maintain as stable an environment as possible. President Buhari and Kemi Adeosun, his finance minister , are both publicly against devaluing the Naira and have been for some time. They oppose this because they want to limit inflation in the country, which already faces rampant inflation. They have held this position for months while banks around the world cringe, knowing that it is unsustainable [...] President Buhari restricted the liquidity of the Naira shortly after coming into office, propping up the currency with billions from the CNB's foreign exchange reserves. To slow the depletion of the CNB's reserves, Nigeria has banned the import of certain goods, ranging from rice to private jets [...] In a drastic attempt to slow the drain of the CNB's foreign exchange reserves, the CNB has further limited the use of the Naira abroad. About 2 weeks ago, the BBC reported that the CBN has 'temporarily' restricted the use of Naira denominated credit and debit cards abroad. This is key because it slows the drain of the CNB's foreign exchange reserves. If this sounds familiar, this is exactly the same model Argentina (NYSEARCA: ARGT ) and Venezuela were running. Venezuela's currency is down more than 99% against the dollar in recent years, and the Argentine peso just enjoyed a 40% devaluation once a more responsible government was recently elected, ending the previous government's shenanigans. Assuming Nigeria is forced to devalue by 40% or so, as the black market suggests, the Nigerian ETF, which is valued in dollars but holds local assets, should devalue drastically overnight. Pretty juicy opportunity, right? And it would probably get worse in the ensuing days, as Nigerian financial institutions - a large component of the ETF - can be expected to take severe pain or fail outright following the devaluation. If nothing else, we've solved the riddle of why Colombia has been underperforming its fellow petro-state despite having a better economy by every measure. Colombia allows its currency to devalue rather than banning rice imports and prohibiting its citizens from using credit cards abroad to maintain a fictional exchange rate. As compelling as shorting the Nigerian ETF may look, a few cautions are in order. First, the ETF has no options, so you can only short outright rather than buying puts. And the borrow fee to short-sell NGE has been moving higher in recent days - approaching 10% on Tuesday. It appears plenty of smart people are figuring this trade out. At least from my perspective, I'd rather short Brazil (NYSEARCA: EWZ ), which is similarly poised for drastic downside, but whose ETF is easy/cheap to borrow and has far better liquidity. Still, on any oil bounce, I'll be watching Nigeria for a short opportunity. Government manipulations of currency always end in tears. As a free market capitalist, there's little that warms my heart more than seizing money from an incompetent government by selling it short. It's reverse taxation at its finest. Don't go long Nigeria under any circumstances, and keep ready to short the country on any bounces. I give my thanks to Mr. Zimmerman for making me aware of the opportunity.
