Movado trades at 4.9x next fiscal year EV/EBITDA (FY2017). MOV trades at lower multiple than its peers. The Apple Watch turns out to be a much milder threat than expected. Movado is an asset-light business. It doesnâ€™t manufacture watches. It's a cash-rich business. Movado Group (NYSE: MOV ) is one of the world's premier watchmakers. Movado Group designs, sources, markets and distributes fine watches in almost every major category comprising the watch industry. You have seen some of its many well-known brands. Its portfolio of brands currently comprises core brands such as Concord, Ebel, ESQ Movado and familiar fashion licensed names as Coach Watches, Scuderia Ferrari Watches, HUGO BOSS Watches, Juicy Couture Watches, Lacoste Watches, Movado, and Tommy Hilfiger Watches. The watches are fabricated through independent contractors in Switzerland and Movado is headquarted in Paramus, New Jersey. Movado is an American company, but has the majority of its watches manufactured in Switzerland and it has been a tough year for Swiss watchmakers. For the past year, Movado's stock price has taken a major fall. Movado is under attack on two different fronts, technology and the rise of the Swiss franc. China's recent stock market turbulence also took its toll on the stock. The introduction of the Apple Watch, combined with a surge in the Swiss franc, have sent Movado stock price from the $40s to a low of $21.42. But the single largest factor behind the decline is due to Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) entering the Smartwatch industry. Apple is casting a giant cloud over the entire industry. Apple has a history of disrupting and dominating an industry once it enters (iTunes, mobile, tablets, you name it etc.). "Apple Watch is the most personal device we've ever created. We set out to make the best watch in the world," said Tim Cook on September 9, 2015 during the Apple Watch announcement. According to the five-year performance chart above, the stock has seen better days. In November 2013, Movado hit a peak of $46.88 per share and traded in the $40s range weeks before the Apple Watch announcement. The stock has been on a downward trend most of the year to hit a low of $21.42 in August. The stock has since recovered with the release of good Q2 results on August 27, 2015. By looking at the graph, you might wonder about certain sharp fluctuations. The severe drop in November 2014 was due to disappointing Q3 results and revised downward guidance. However Q4 2014 results turned out above the revised guidance and the stock picked up to $30 to only make its way down afterward. YTD the stock is down -4.37% and the 1-year return is down -20.35%. Apple's entry into watches is definitely a concern, but the Apple Watch turns out to be a much milder threat than expected. There's positive side to the Apple Watch story. First it got millennials interested in watches or at least talking about them. One needs to look at a company like Shinola , which prides itself on manufacturing its watches in Detroit; it's a major hit among hipsters and I should mention that the company's watches are good old quartz ones, not smart. Swatch Group AG ( OTCPK:SWGAY ) said the company has been trying to sell its smartwatch since 2000. Now that Apple is there, demand for Swatch's smartwatches has boosted. Second, concerns about smartwatches are driving innovation across the Swiss industry, which could help longer-term sales. Most brands are coming out with some kind of wearable/smart device. Some will be hits, some will be mostly misses. However, this innovation will plant the seeds for the future of the industry. There will be trickle-down effects and lead to better products down the line. Movado doesn't have significant exposure to Asia, with only 8% of net sales. The U.S., a strong and growing watch market, is responsible for 55% of Movado's sales. Swatch Group AG, probably Movado's most comparable competitor, has a lot of exposure in Asia. Swatch posted a 20% drop in first-half profit, and noted weaker demand from markets, such as Hong Kong, but net sales increased 2.2% to 4.19 billion swiss francs from 4.1 billion swiss francs. Updates from the Compagnie Financiere Richemont ( OTCPK:CFRHF ) and Prada ( OTCPK:PRDSY ) were better than expected, despite the turmoil gripping China. Basically this is saying that China's thirst for luxury goods is still there. There are many things that I like about Movado. It is a business that has good or improving economics, and often generates sales and profits in multiple jurisdictions. Movado is cheap. It is attractively valued at 4.9x next fiscal year EV/EBITDA and a price to earnings of 11.3x (detailed valuation below). The balance sheet is mostly cash and inventory. The company carries net cash of ~$148m. That's a lot of cash when your market cap is about $600m. At the moment, Movado is completing a $100m share buyback program. It's expected to continue to aggressively buyback shares with a renewed program in November 2015. Usually when you buy 10%-15% of the float, it should fuel EPS higher. Movado trades at 1.3x book value and no value is given to its own brands. Movado's brands - Ebel, Concord, ESQ, and Movado - are given no intangible value on the balance sheet. They are obviously worth something on the open market, since they bring so much cash to Movado. The business model is asset-light, because the capital intensive process of manufacturing watches is done by somebody else. The latest quarter revealed that the Apple Watch threat was overblown. Sales were up 1.4% over the same quarter last year, and that's taking into account a $6.8m hit because of the currency fluctuation. Movado also maintained its full-year guidance for this fiscal year. As for the smartwatch threat, Movado is entering the arena in Q4 with its own "smart" device. And last, I'm not a watch connoisseur but I really like the look of the classic Movado Museum style. I find a lot of watches to be jam-packed with info and too crowded (Movado has those too). I just need a watch that looks good with a suit or to go out to a dinner, not a tool to control a space station. It's clean, simple, and elegant. There's an intangible there. Movado watches looked great forty years ago, look great today, and will look great in forty years. I want to make it clear that Movado does not manufacture any of the products it sells (just like Nike (NYSE: NKE ) doesn't produce any shoes). Movado employs a flexible manufacturing model that relies on independent manufacturers to meet shifts in marketplace demand and changes in consumer preferences. Except for certain models mentioned below, Movado's watches are manufactured in Swizterland through an independent third party. Movado (with the exception of Movado BOLD), Ebel and Concord watches are manufactured in Switzerland by independent third-party assemblers. All Movado, ESQ Movado, Ebel and Concord watches are manufactured using Swiss movements. All of Movado's products are manufactured using components obtained from third-party suppliers. ESQ Movado and Movado BOLD watches are manufactured by independent contractors in Asia using Swiss movements. Coach, Tommy Hilfiger, Hugo Boss ( OTCPK:BOSSY ), Juicy Couture, Scuderia Ferrari and Lacoste watches are manufactured by independent contractors in Asia. Movado is said to be highly selective in its licensing strategy and chooses to enter into long-term agreements with only powerful brands. The following table sets forth the brands licensed by Movado. Movado Group portfolio of brands. Source: 2015-10K. Movado Group sells all of its brands in the U.S. wholesale market primarily to major jewelry store chains, such as Helzberg Diamonds Corp. and Sterling, Inc., department stores, such as Macy's (NYSE: M ) and Nordstrom (NYSE: JWN ), as well as independent jewelers. Sales to trade customers in the U.S. are made directly by the Movado's U.S. sales force and, to a lesser extent, independent sales representatives. Internationally, Movado's brands are sold through a combination of department stores, its own sale force and independent distributors. The company also operates Movado Retail Group, which has 38 outlet stores located in centers across the U.S. The current Movado Group was founded by Gedalio Grinberg (1931-2009). Mr. Grinberg is a legend in the watch industry for recognizing the potential cachet of luxury watches and marketing them accordingly. Mr. Grinberg was born in Cuba and escaped to Miami in 1960 after receiving death threats from Fidel Castro's secret police. With two other refugees, he set up a Piaget distributorship in New York. The company, known for years as the North American Watch Company, first distributed other companies' Swiss watches. It then acquired watch companies, including Movado and Concord, to build its own portfolio of bands. Movado went public in 1993. Mr. Grinberg helped developed the "status" watch market. Watches were considered utilitarian and Americans, unlike Europeans, regarded watches as a gift for high school graduation. Mr. Grinberg helped changed that perception. In 1988, Forbes said, "Grinberg helped make Americans conscious of their watches and made the glint of gold on a male wrist a status symbol." Mr. Grinberg said he wanted people to believe that a watch on a wrist could be as impressive as a Cadillac in a driveway. Watch Time said Mr. Grinberg had led "a revolution in watch marketing in America." Movado was a struggling brand when it was acquired by Grinberg in 1983. Sales that year totaled just $4 million. The Grinberg team created a new product line around the Museum Watch and a new advertising campaign aimed at a younger, more educated audience, with an interest in culture and arts. The formula worked. In 1987, Movado's sales reached $50 million. Since then, it has become the core brand and flagship of Grinberg's company, which officially became known as the Movado Group in 1996. His son, Efraim Grinberg , the current Chairman and CEO, joined the company in 1980 and is running it from the early 90s as the COO and became CEO in 2001. His two other kids, Alex Grinberg and Miriam Phalen, also worked for Movado and together they control the company through Class A shares, which is entitled to 10.3x votes per common share. I don't believe the market consensus that smartwatches is the major threat to the traditional watch industry. They are a threat, but milder than expected. Plus the industry is responding. Like Movado, Frederique Constant and Mondaine announced they will sell a smartwatch/device. Compagnie Financiere Richemont SA's Montblanc brand introduced an " e-Strap ," and Swatch Group AG has smart devices. Economic volatility is more of a threat to sales than Apple's latest fashion experiment. In August 2015, according to the Fédération de l'industrie horlogère suisse FH's report , Swiss watch exports decline of 1.6% compared to August 2014. Shipments to Hong Kong, the largest market, declined 18%, while China registered a 38.5% decline. Meanwhile, the important markets of the U.S., Japan, Germany and France all registered growth in excess of 10%. You can get a lot of Swiss watch industry statistics here . The report also goes on to explain the value of exported watches fell by only 2.4%, volumes for their part contracted by 9.6%.In both cases, steel products determined the overall result. The only significant improvement concerned the value of precious metal watches and gold-steel watches were down 1.6%. The price category that was hurt the most are watches costing between 200-500 francs (USD$204 - USD$511 @1 CHF=1.02 USD), while the 500-3,000 francs category remained close to the sectoral average, with a decline in value of 3.4%. Sales of watches costing more than $3,000 were up 1.7%. Source: Fédération de l'industrie horlogère suisse FH Basically, what I noted from the report, is that sales are down because of a very large drop in the Far East. For the rest of the world, in particular the U.S. and Europe, watch sales are doing fine. How does this relate to Movado? If the data is accurate, Movado's licensed brands were the most affected by the Asian summer slump. They are mostly metal watches and cheaper than Movado's luxury brands. On the other hand, its owned luxury brand portfolio, the $2,000 and up watches, wasn't impacted and maybe probably benefited. Also Movado is not as exposed to Asia as its competitors. In fiscal 2015, only 8% of sales were in Asia and 55% in the U.S, a more favorable growing market. Q2 2016, which included results in July 2015, showed increased sales in both luxury and licensed categories. We will know in November the exact impact of the volatile summer on the numbers. Part of this segment was derived from my blog and does not affect Movado's valuation. I offer my opinion on the Apple Watch and various devices, so feel free to skip it. With phones, tablets and other devices, do you really need a watch to remind you to check your Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) notifications? A watch is a fashion accessory. We obviously know that buying a watch has nothing to do with knowing the correct time; if it did we would buy a $5 Casio (plus isn't what a smartphone is for?). There are plenty of wrist devices on the market, but in this segment I mostly focus on the Apple Watch since it's the product generating the most buzz. At the moment wrist gadgets are a trend. That might change in the future but at the moment, just like a "dumb" watch, the Apple Watch is a fashion gadget accessory. Apple might think the company is in the luxury watch segment but it is not. The $350 Apple Watch, I get it and it will get buyers. It's a gadget, a toy, something cool to have, at $350, not $17k. The $17,000 gold Apple Watch, I don't get it and I'm not alone. When I talked to other people about the high-end $17k watch, their first reaction is not "OMG, I can't afford it" but it's more "wow that's stupid, who's going to buy that?" Clearly not the same reaction when you see a Rolex. It's probably one of the rare bad decisions Apple made (along with Apple Map and free U2 album .) Apple will not succeed in the luxury watch market. You can't be a mass consumer product company and pretend to be the Bentley of watches at the same time Apple won't disclose how many smartwatches they sold for "competitive reasons". "This isn't a matter of not being transparent, but a matter of not giving our competition insight." said Tim Cook. Apple didn't break out watch sales separately, as it does with iPhones and iPads. However Apple is not shy to tell us every three months how many iPhones they sold. Who cares now about giving competition insights? "270,000 iPhones sold in the first two days after it was released at the end of the quarter. The iPhone is off to a great start-we hope to sell our one-millionth iPhone by the end of its first full quarter of sales," said Steve Jobs. Same thing with the iPad when it came out, Apple didn't mind parading around their great sales. A fine luxury watch is cool, classic, and never goes out of style. A high-quality watch is a timeless collectible piece of micro-engineering. A watch remains a status symbol, and an important asset. A legacy watch is supposed to project success and lust. The kind of asset that keeps its value over time and that you might want to pass on with pride to your grand-children one day. I can't picture myself donating the Apple Watch (or you favorite wrist device) as part of the family heritage in 50 years or so. Imagine kids in fifty years receiving their grandpa's first gold Apple watch (Which would answer the question of what I did with their college money, but at least you could salvage the gold). Anybody who wanted an Apple Watch bought one by now. We don't hear anything about Google's Android Wear or the Garmin smart watch that you can buy at the Dell store . I'm surrounded with friends who are Apple lovers (I'm referring to the company in Cupertino, not the fruit, and I believe they are formally known as Mac Addicts ?). These Apple lovers I'm referring to have all the devices but have no interest in the Apple Watch. High quality, expensive Swiss timepieces will remain a means for the wealthy to distinguish themselves. With Apple playing the fashion card, it means that it could be unfashionable. At the lower-end of the segment, smartwatches have an impact on the market. In the high-end luxury segment, having a piece of software telling you how many steps you took waters down the prestige element. Movado conducts its business primarily in two operating segments: Wholesale and Retail. The Wholesale segment includes the designing, manufacturing and distribution of quality watches and revenue generated from after-sales service activities and shipping. The Retail segment includes the Movado's outlet stores. Movado also operates in two major geographic locations: U.S. operations and International. Movado has divided its watch business into two principal categories: the luxury and the licensed brands categories. The luxury brands category consists of Movado's own brands (Ebel, Concord, Movado and ESQ). Watches in the licensed brands category include Coach, HUGO BOSS, Juicy Couture, Lacoste, Tommy Hilfiger and Scuderia Ferrari. Key drivers are new product innovation and strong marketing. Movado has two major selling seasons. The spring season, this includes school graduations and several holidays and, most importantly, the Christmas and holiday season. Major selling seasons in certain international markets center on significant local holidays that occur in late winter or early spring. Historically sales have been higher during the second half of the fiscal year with ~55% of Movado's net sales. 55% of sales were in the U.S. That includes wholesale and retail. The rest was on the international market. The international sales are pretty diversified. During fiscal 2015, Europe accounted for 18.9% of sales, the Americas (excluding the U.S.) 11.4%, Asia 8%, and the Middle East for 7.1%. During FY 2014 whole sales to U.S. grew 4.9% while international sales were flat. Retail sales are up 9.2% which is primarily attributable to the opening of new stores. Comparable outlet stores increased 2.5% from prior year sales. All outlets locations are in the U.S. For the first six-months of fiscal 2015, net sales increased 0.6% to $266m compared to $264m. Source: Movado Group, Inc. at the 16th Annual ICR XChange Conference Presentation We are currently in fiscal 2016 and it ends on January 31, 2016. That means there's 6 quarters left of results to achieve their objectives. How is Movado going to achieve that? On the revenue side, Movado Group wants to hit $750m in sales by January 31, 2017. On the strategic plan that represents a CAGR on revenues of 10% on fiscal 2014 to 2017. Where are we now? Pretty far. TTM revenues are at $588m and guidance for FY 2016 is $590m (two quarters left, half year sales are at $266m). Movado's gross margins are primarily affected by four major factors: brand and product sales mix, product pricing strategy, manufacturing costs and fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates, in particular the relationship between the U.S. dollar and the Swiss franc. Movado's gross margins may not be comparable to its comps since some companies include all the costs related to their distribution networks and other expenses. Movado includes those as its SG&A expenses. Watches in the luxury category generally earn higher gross margin percentages than watches in the licensed brand category. The difference in gross margin percentages for the licensed brand category is primarily due to the impact of royalty payments made on the licensed brands. Movado's cost of sales consists primarily of raw material, component costs, royalties, labor, assembly costs, depreciation, amortization and unit overhead costs associated with the company's supply chain operations in Switzerland and Asia. The Swiss franc's appreciation has hurt Movado. The currency has risen more than 10% against the euro since the Swiss National Bank (SNB) dropped its cap in January. As Movado manufactures its watches in Switzerland with a cost base largely in Swiss francs and a portion of its sales in foreign currencies, the SNB's decision raises problems. Swiss watchmakers, which have long touted production in Switzerland as a guarantee of quality, can't shift production to cheaper countries. In response, Movado have been selectively raising prices but it hasn't been enough to compensate for the slight margin erosion. Below is a table of Movado's gross profit and margins. On a five-year basis, from 2011 to 2015, Movado has improved its gross margin and profit. However it has slightly been dipping since 2013. A large part of the dip is due mostly to the unfavorable impact of fluctuation in forex. A small part in the dip was due to severance agreements from Movado's operating efficiencies initiative. The decline was partly offset by the shift in product mix, price increases, and certain sourcing improvement. Operating income and margin, a key metric, has improved over the last couple years, in part because Movado has been focusing on becoming a more efficient and productive company. Because of reasons cited above, margins have dipped a couple basis points. Movado's goal (see slide above) to achieve 15% operating income margin by FY 2017, a goal that won't likely be achieved, but at least the company is heading in the right direction. A reverse of the Swiss franc would definitely help. And since the goal of achieving $750m in revenues won't be accomplished, the goal of $115m in operating income won't be attained. Movado had a goal of achieving $3 EPS by 2017. Again another ambitious goal that I doubt will be achieved. With sales growing slower than expected, the main EPS driver will be aggressive share buybacks and cost cutting. Analyst consensus for FY 2017 EPS is $2.31. That's a 15.5% growth rate over this year's target. This year's EPS guidance of $2-$2.10 includes a reduced share count but not for next year. So EPS could be higher if Movado renews its share repurchase program. The Grinberg family doesn't have a lot of common shares, but have control because of its Class A shares. Power is concentrated in three people's hand. Efraim Grinberg, Alexander Grinberg, Miriam Phalen. Each Class A share is entitled to ten votes per share. Unfortunately, management doesn't hold a lot of stock. Richard Coté, the Vice Chairman and COO, is also the largest holder and is currently selling. As of September 24, he holds 410,222 shares after selling 11,000 shares . He's gradually selling his stake but he remains the person with the largest stake. Of course, I don't like it when management is selling its shares, but Movado's aggressive buyback gives me confidence. Above is Movado's largest shareholders as of June 30, 2015. Most of them have been long-term holders. A few of them hold close to 10% of the common share even though you can't influence anything. One noticeable shareholder is Royce & Associates LLC with a 15.4% of the common shares in the company. Royce & Associates is highly regarded small cap value investor Chuck Royce's company. The Royce Funds is a family of funds that focuses primarily on small-cap investing, and has been considered one of the industry's most experienced smaller-company stock pickers. Having Chuck Royce's family of funds as shareholders is a vote of confidence. Another noticeable shareholder is Epoch Investment Partners Inc., which is another respectable fund manager. By the way, Sigma Capital Management LLC is not a shareholder. I don't know why it shows you because as you can see the latest data is 2014. Movado Group screens pretty well. Now I just have to make sure it's not some kind of value trap. Companies that trade at such low multiples usually warrant it. We are in a market where it's really hard to find good companies trading at good prices. It's a pretty tough environment to be a luxury watch manufacturer. First thing I did is that I made a comps table that you will find below. It's difficult to find pure-play comparables. Watchmakers and luxury apparel companies trade all over the world and they operate in many different fashion segments (watches, jewelry, apparels). Some of the comps above own several of the world's leading companies in the field of luxury good in jewelry and luxury watches. Swatch Group AG is the most similar watchmaker to Movado Group. It's a global company with many different luxury watch segments. The cheapest stock of the group by valuation metrics, Fossil (NASDAQ: FOSL ), deserves its valuation since it's not performing very well and has been lowering guidance. Without Fossil the group's EV/EBITDA average is 10.6x instead of 9.5x just to show how much Fossil drags the group's average down. Movado Group is by far the smallest company of the group and the only one with a market cap under one billion. What does it all mean? Fossil, the struggling company, is trading at 5.11x trailing EV/EBITDA. You could make the case that Fossil is also the worst performing company of the group. Movado, which is performing relatively well, is trading at 5.65x EV/EBITDA. As discussed above, Q2-2015 results have demonstrated that the company is navigating the difficult context pretty well. Swatch Group AG, which has a lot of exposure to Asia (50%+ sales), and despite the recent difficulties, is trading at a much higher multiple of 8.27x EV/EBITDA. MOV can't command an EV/EBITDA over 10x like the Compagnie Financière Richmond SA , Kering SA ( OTCPK:PPRUY ), or LVMH ( OTCPK:LVMUY ), because we are talking about companies operating in a different league. It wouldn't be fair to apply their metrics to Movado. I don't believe it would give you a reasonable valuation range. This brings me back to the 8.27x Swatch Group AG is trading at. The major difference between the two is size. Swatch is a ~$20b market cap company and Movado is hovering around ~$600m. There's a potential discount for the lack of control. The Grinberg family (Efraim, Alex, and Miriam) hold voting power through their Class A shares. It's good to have insiders that are heavily invested in the company but on the other hand one must wonder if their interest is aligned with the shareholders. Back to the EV/EBITDA multiple, Movado looks attractive in a takeover situation because of its small size and lack of debt, Movado could command a 8x EV/EBITDA. The FY2017 EBITDA derived from estimated FY2017 sales of $623.8m (analyst consensus). I apply a 15% EBITDA margin, below the 16.5% average of the last three fiscal years. I used a lower number to take into account the lower Swiss franc and other negative pressure. The projected sales is far from the $750m goal that was established in their strategic plan. Even if I used $600m in sales, up from $590m for FY2016, at 7x EBITDA I get an implied share price of $34 for a return of 28.1%. This is a very reasonable conservative approach. My valuation assumes a lower FY2017 revenues ($600m vs 623.8m analysts), lower EBITDA margin (15% vs 16.5% three year average), and a lower EV/EBITDA multiple (7x vs 9.5x average vs 8.27 for Swatch). Movado's strategic plan called for EPS of $3.00 by FY2017. Just like the sales target, I believe this is overly optimistic. Analyst average estimate is $2.31 FY2017 EPS, which I believe is reasonable. It could be higher depending on how aggressive the next share repurchase program is. During Q2-2016, MOV repurchased approximately 613,000 shares under its share repurchase program. As of July 31, 2015, the company had $24m remaining under the $100m share repurchase authorization. I assume that Movado will use the rest of the $24m. At current price, I estimate that between 800k to 900k will be repurchased. The FY2016 EPS guidance is not affected because it already includes a reduced share count. Movado might renew a $50m repurchase program and it could go as high as $100m again if it wanted to. Below there's a table on the repurchase program for FY2017. I also assumed a $28 and $30 repurchase average price. It sounds paradoxal, but the lower the share price the more beneficial it is to long-term shareholders. I know that my analysis below is a very straightforward linear example and life doesn't work out in a linear path. There's a lot of assumptions going into this such as 1) if they renew the share repurchase program 2) getting the average cost right, and 3)hitting earnings estimates. The point I'm trying to make is not projecting the right numbers but to demonstrate the effect of share repurchase on EPS. On a price-to-earnings approach, I relied on analyst's consensus for FY2017. It's could higher depending on how aggressive is the next share repurchase program mentioned above. Under this approach, the low range estimate derives an implied share price of $32 per share for 23.6% upside. A 15x multiple to earnings would deliver a 32.4% return. Under my valuation approaches, I get a share price range of $32 to $39. I think Movado is worth $35 a share which would represent a 32% return without dividends. MOV currently trades at 4.9x next fiscal EV/EBITDA and provides a 7% free cash flow yield. There's enough of a margin of safety to take into account potential misjudgement and protect against the downside. The brands Ebel, Concord, ESQ, and Movado must be worth something on the market. The balance sheet doesn't reflect that since there's no intangible recorded. Also my valuation assumes a lower FY 2017 revenues ($600m vs 623.8m analysts), lower EBITDA margin (15% vs 16.5% three year average), and a lower EV/EBITDA multiple (7x vs 9.5x average vs 8.27x for Swatch). Movado has a rock-solid balance sheet with lots of cash. A lot of that money is being used for an aggressive share repurchase program. Five consecutive years of growth in sales. Movado realized a compounded annual sales growth of 9% during that period. Movado has been decreasing operating expenses from 50% to 40% of sales. Movado continued to gain market share domestically (U.S.) in the $300 to $3,000 price range. Movado manages to grow in a weak economy and intense competition. Movado's portfolio of fashion brands are some of greatest brand names in the world have recognized Movado for its competency to develop its watch business. Very diverse portfolio that caters to many different demographics. MOV has developed strong new product pipeline. A smart device is expected in the fourth quarter. Movado brand, a leader in the $300 to $3000 price category in North America, continued to gain market share. Constantly introducing new products. Good product mix. Undertaking several advertising campaigns to market its products. U.S. sales of fine jewelry and fine watches increased by 3.5 percent in July, according to the latest data from the U.S. Department of Commerce. June sales gains reflect a modest increase. The Deloitte survey showed that Swiss watchmakers' optimism about sales in the U.S. - home of the smartwatch - was at a record high. The rise of the smartwatch. After reading my article my views are clear. However they remain a threat and compete for the consumer's dollar. The strong Swiss franc is a concern. Extreme fluctuation in foreign currency exchange impacts results. Movado is particularly affected by currency swing because most of its production is in Switzerland. The Swiss franc has risen more than 10% against the euro since the Swiss National Bank dropped its cap in January. Luxury spending in two major markets, Hong-Kong and China, is significantly down. A report by Deloitte showed that pessimism about the economic outlook was at its highest since at least 2012 Millennials who often don't wear watches. "Traditional" watches are not exciting. If the Movado loses any of its license agreements, there may be significant loss of revenues and a negative effect on business. The Grinberg family owns a majority of the voting power of Movado's stock. They control the family through Class A shares, where each Class A shares is entitled to 10 votes. That might at times be in conflict with shareholder interest. MOV is targeting EPS of $3 in Fiscal 2017. Even if they come close to hitting it, the stock remains cheap on a F2017 P/E basis. A drop in the overvalued Swiss franc. Market realization of Movado's own brands. (There are no intangible on the balance sheet). Although this is a challenging period for disciplined value investors, I remain confident that Movado will deliver satisfying results over time. This is not a pitch about a high-growth company with blue-sky forecasts. It's simply a case of market mispricing. Movado remains unloved or overlooked by the broader market today. The Apple Watch threat to the industry is overblown. Movado's first six-month results were encouraging. Despite the "Apple watch storm" and the "Swiss franc storm", instead of getting slaughtered, Movado still managed to increase sales. It seems that the Apple watch buzz is over. Anybody who wanted an Apple Watch already bought it. Baselworld (the annual Comic-Con of watch) turned out to be a success and pretty much shrugged off the Apple Watch. The market expected the worst, but the worst didn't come. Instead of a F5 hurricane, Movado was hit by clouds. When will the market change its mind? Well, Apple does cast a pretty large shadow. Movado can't control what Apple does or market's sentiment. But what Movado can control is its financial performance. If it can keep delivering on the results side, then the market will realize that Movado is fine. MOV maintains its guidance for fiscal 2016. So that's a good sign. Movada expects net sales to be in the range of $590m to $600m, gross margin of 53.5%, and operating income to increase approximately to $72m to $75m. Net income should be in the range of $48.5m to $51m, or EPS $2.00 to $2.10. The SNB decided to keep its main interest rate at -0.75%, saying that the Swiss franc was still "significantly overvalued." The SNB wants to make the Swiss franc much less attractive. A lower Swiss franc is in Movado's interest since a big part of its cost base is in Switzerland. As explained in the article, the higher Swiss franc has caused havoc in the watch industry. Lower cost base means better margins and better results. And better results should result in a higher stock price. There are several catalysts that could push Movado higher. The first one and immediately effective is Movado continuing to aggressively buyback its shares. Movado is finishing a $100m share buyback program; it's expected to renew it in November. Another $50m to $100m in buybacks would shave 10%-15% of the shares outstanding and would fuel EPS higher. Obviously, the two main factors is how big the share buyback program is and the average purchase price. Another catalyst is a market normalization of Movado valuation metric. MOV's valuation metrics are lower than its peers and is not warranted. Movado trades at 13.5x trailing P/E versus 17.7x for its peers. Next year's P/E ratio is a low 11.3x. At the current price, Movado could be a nice takeover target. It's a small target with global reach, it has $148m in net cash and generates plenty of free cash flow with a FCF yield of ~6.5%. Of course the only issue would be convincing the Grinberg family to sell. Another observation is that the market doesn't seem to attribute any value to Movado's own brands. On the balance sheet, there are no intangibles recorded. The brands Ebel, Concord, ESQ, and Movado must be worth something on the market if sold. Movado currently trades at an attractive entry point. Under my valuation approaches, I get a share price range of $32 to $39. I think Movado is worth $35 a share which would represent a 32% return without dividends. Movado currently trades at 4.9x next fiscal EV/EBITDA. There's enough of a margin of safety to take into account for potential misjudgment and protect against the downside. My valuation assumes lower FY 2017 revenues ($600m vs 623.8m analysts), lower EBITDA margin (15% vs 16.5% three year average), and a lower EV/EBITDA multiple (7x vs 9.5x average vs 8.27x for Swatch). While you wait you can rely on the small but growing dividend to compensate for your patience. Movado will be rewarding to the patient investor.
