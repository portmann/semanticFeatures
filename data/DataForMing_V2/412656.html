Has Ford's Ship Sailed? - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Despite operations performing better than expected over the past few quarters, Ford still trades at a very low multiple. The last few articles on SA have questioned whether or not Ford is worth investing in here. After a year and half of being bullish, we step back to ask whether or not a long term investment in Ford is still warranted. We have been reading the latest commentary on Ford (NYSE: F ) here on Seeking Alpha and wanted to step back and take a look at Ford as an investment going forward. Our previous articles about Ford have all centered around the company's performance and how the company's international expansion, we think, will help the bottom line and eventually move the stock price higher. In recent news, one of the metrics that we have been following very closely for the last year and a half, European auto registrations, again posted good numbers for April, despite Ford losing a little bit of marketshare, Ford (NYSE: F ) car registrations +4.0% to 89,145 units in April, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. Overall EU registrations +9.1% Y/Y to 1,273,733 units in April, driven higher by double-digit growth in Italy and Spain. Registrations were up 8% in Germany and 7% in France. While the loss of marketshare is to be noted, this still forecasts a boom in automobiles overseas, in key countries for Ford's international expansion. All in all, good news. Our investment thesis for the last year has generally been focused around these key metrics that we get about once or twice a month. We have been following them closely, taking into account small aberrations that are normal through the course of business, and we continue to think that Ford is executing well both domestically and internationally. The last few articles on Seeking Alpha have talked less and less about the company's performance over the last year and more about what the future is going to be holding for the automaker. Granted, this is the best way to look at publicly traded equities, but we think Ford's strong track record since the crisis in 2008 paints the picture of a company that is versatile and does what it needs to in order to adapt to its surroundings and flourish as a business. That should not be ignored. The disconnect comes from somebody that looks at the company's valuation and sees that it is trading between 6x and 7x next year's earnings. F PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts There are two scenarios when a company is trading this cheap. Either it is an unbelievable bargain, or it is trading this low for a reason. With Ford, we think it is a mixture of both and we are not afraid to keep long-term capital in Ford as an investment going forward from this point. First, you look at the fundamental business. The business is in arguably the best shape it has ever been in the company's history. The company has made a successful transition to aluminum with the F-150, it's trucks and SUVs continue to drive record sales both domestically and overseas, and the company's comprehensive effort to roll out to other geographies has taken hold. Ford is starting to turn a profit in international locations, albeit barely, and that is the first step to diversification that repels economic cycle downturns and adds further profitability. As we have said prior, despite the auto market looking like it is entering a bubble, the average age of a vehicle on the road is still at all-time highs and at over 11 years. Those two metrics tell us that this automotive cycle could generate higher than expected sales, while we do agree that the quality of credit that is being extended needs to be looked at. Obviously, when we are at the end of a short-term economic cycle, the quality of credit terms deteriorate in order to push through sales. We presented in the past, a pair trade by going long F and short CACC to short the finance bubble while at the same time having the benefits of being long the company that is paying the 4.55% dividend. F Dividend Yield (TTM) data by YCharts And that is one of the reasons that Ford as an investment doesn't bother us if it goes sideways. We are pleased with the company's ability to allocate capital, prudently managing it between returning to shareholders and investing it in the company's international projects. Ford has invested billions in Mexico and China over the last 2 to 3 years because they know those densely populous areas will be key to the company's global success. At the same time, management has not forgotten the shareholders and Ford continues to yield a dividend that is now at 4.55%. If the stock stays parked, or even if it moves lower, we suggest taking these dividends and reinvesting them if you have a long term multiple year outlook on Ford as we do. Our plan is to hold our shares through this coming short-term economic cycle move, and to continue to allow shares to collect dividends while we reinvest them no matter where the price moves from here. Back to Ford as an investment. If you were looking for a short-term 20% gainer, Ford is not the best place to look. As a matter fact, if you were looking at anything over the course of the short-term, Ford may not be the stock for you. However, if you have a multiple year outlook and remain confident that the company can execute internationally, Ford may be a great place to park a nominal amount of capital that you can use to take advantage of a great yield. The story is that we are waiting for Ford's management to execute internationally, and the company is paying us to wait. Knowing the pedigree of management and the company's track record for the last seven or eight years, we think Ford is still a good place to have some capital invested.
