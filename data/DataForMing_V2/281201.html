Altera Will Boost Intel's Network Function Virtualization Push - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I am/we are long INTC. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. Intelâ€™s next round of growth will come from network virtualization. Altera, now part of Intel, will help the company become the dominant player in FPGA-based NFV. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) completed the $16.7 billion buyout of Altera, which now is a part of Intel. CEO Brian Krzanich said: Altera is now part of Intel, and together we will make the next generation of semiconductors not only better but able to do more. We will apply Moore's Law to grow today's FPGA business, and we'll invent new products that make amazing experiences of the future possible - experiences like autonomous driving and machine learning. What Krzanich said is really significant for Intel's future growth and share price. Applying Moore's Law to grow today's FPGA business is the next big thing in the semiconductor industry. Fellow SA contributor Bruce Burnworth once commented in one of my previous Intel articles that network virtualization is an area that will drive high teen growth for Intel after 2018, when cloud growth will start to taper off. This area will make huge use of FPGAs, according to Mr. Burnworth. I completely agree with him. In his recent article Burnworth opined that after Altera Intel could buyout a company in the NFV (network function virtualization) field. However, I believe collaboration with VNF (virtual network functions) developers is the key to succeed rather than a new acquisition. It's really a complex topic. In this article I will try to delve deeper into this emerging area. The term network virtualization typically refers to the process of combining both hardware- and software-based networking resources into a software-based entity in order to enhance the efficiency of networks. In order to keep cost at a minimum level along with enhancing efficiency, telecom operators and enterprises are embracing network virtualization. Furthermore, the implementation of VNF has been rising steadily. Since VNF allows using software without depending on underlying hardware, both capex and opex savings can be achieved. Investors should note that NFV and VNF are different, although used by networking professionals interchangeably. Here's an example . In 2012, a group of major telcos took an initiative to apply the technology of virtualization and cloud to the telecom domain. The term NFV was coined then to represent the initiative. NFV allows running SDNs (software-defined networks) independent of hardware platforms and VNF is the building block of an NFV framework. Understanding the difference is important because Intel is trying to integrate SDN and NFV on standard x86 platforms to expand the competitive advantage of the platform. To learn more about the difference from an expert, click here . The current trend of implementing NFV predominantly depends on utilizing commodity processors. Intel is preparing its x86 platform to make it the default hardware platform for deploying NFV along with SDN in future. If Intel can offer telecom operators and enterprises a processor that makes proper use of FPGAs in implementing NFV, the potential of Intel's x86 platform will rise substantially. This will lead to increasing demand for Intel's products based on ONP (open network platform) server reference design, starting from processors to communications chipsets to Ethernet controllers. I discussed more rigorously about Intel's ONP server reference design is a previous article . A research paper proposed couple of years ago that the use of FPGAs could be an ideal platform for NFV. The paper also presented the opportunities for an FPGA-based NFV platform. Excerpts from the paper are presented below : By using FPGAs as the main hardware, NFV could achieve the flexibility and the fast deployment of the software-solutions and the high throughput of the specialized hardware devices. FPGA-based NFV can provide the flexibility of the NFV based on general purpose processors (GPP's) while at the same time providing the necessary throughput that the GPP cannot sustain. By the term general purpose processors researchers wanted to mean commodity processors. The industry is slowly but surely heading towards the FPGA-based NFV era, as predicted and proposed by the researchers. FPGAs make data processing faster by incorporating parallelism. According to an expert : An FPGA is, as the name would imply, a big old list of gatesâ€?AND gates, NOT gates, XOR gates... the whole familyâ€?a line of digital turnstiles stretching around the entire globe. These gates are designed to do something to a piece or pieces of data, and they're able to do it all at once. This is in contrast to a normal sequential computer processor which would instead iterate through that array of gates, doing one operation at a time. So: the parallel FPGA just takes a single step through the whole line of gates, while the sequential processor has to walk around the whole globe, going one turnstile at a time. Aside from Altera, Xilinx (NASDAQ: XLNX ) also helps chipmakers offer parallelism via processors. Xilinx offers SDAccel, a software defined environment, which can boost the performance of VNFs. It also offers SDNet which supports SDN. The moot question now is what's Intel's competitive advantage with the Altera buyout when every chipmaker can bundle FPGAs with their chips? So what is OpenStack? It's an open-source community that develops cloud management technologies, which RackSpace (NYSE: RAX ) and NASA jointly launched in 2010. The OpenStack Foundation was formed in 2012. OpenStack has the potential to unlock the full benefits of NFV with Intel at its forefront. Intel has been elected as the first new Platinum member of the OpenStack Foundation with effect from January 1, 2015, along with a seat on its Board. OpenStack is developing rapidly, and as it continues to grow, it will gradually help overcome the shortcomings today's NFV environments are facing. Telecom operators and enterprises desperately need a comprehensive NFV platform based on OpenStack. If readers want to learn in detail how OpenStack could help NFV become mature, I'd recommend reading this article written by an industry insider. Long story short, Intel's competitive advantage lies in jointly building the NFV platform mentioned above leveraging OpenStack's resources and exploiting its partnerships with OpenStack pioneers like RackSpace and VNF developers like Alcatel-Lucent (NYSE: ALU ). Intel's ultimate aim is to dominate the NFV space by making its x86 platform the default choice for telcos. In 2015, Intel and RackSpace agreed to build an OpenStack Innovation Center in San Antonio, Texas. Two 1,000-node server clusters were provided to developers for free for testing and validating OpenStack code. Intel has established a partnership with Alcatel-Lucent also for improving the latter's CloudBand NFV platform via OpenStack. A PoC (Proof of Concept) study conducted by ETSI's (European Telecommunications Standards Institute) NFV Industry Specification Group examined the benefits of hardware acceleration in NFV environments. In the study, the engineers installed Altera's FPGA card. They also programmed it using Altera's IPsec accelerator. They repeated the test and concluded the following: This test demonstrated exactly one of the two approaches to compute intensive functions. By pairing a CPU and FPGA, the heterogeneous hardware remains flexible and ready to implement any virtual network functions. Obviously collaboration between the VNF developer and the FPGA vendor must exist. This type of development is exactly what the ETSI NFV ISG PoCs are meant to stimulate. So it seems that the mission, in this case, is accomplished. It is noteworthy here that as the study suggests, Intel as an FPGA vendor is heading in the right direction by collaborating with VNF developers like Alcatel-Lucent. In this article I tried to establish the fact that Intel's collaboration with key companies will make it the dominant player in the NFV space. However, as I said in the beginning, this is a complex subject. Nonetheless, NFV is a nascent area that offers Intel meaningful growth opportunities. Investors should continue to focus on Intel's new collaborations to evaluate whether its competitive advantage remains intact. Tagged: Investing Ideas , Technology
