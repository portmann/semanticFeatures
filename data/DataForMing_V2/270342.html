Verizon: Don't Sell Even If Margins Are Peaking - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha Stone Fox Capital , Stone Fox Capital (1,681 clicks) An influential analyst downgraded Verizon to neutral based on peaking margins and concerns about phone payment plans. The stock has traded flat for three years now. For over 30 months now, Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ ) has gone virtually nowhere. The stock originally hit the $45 range in April 2013 and has mostly traded sideways ever since. The stock offers a nearly 5% yield with interest rates near zero even after the recent rate hike by the Fed. My investment thesis on Verizon turned bullish over the summer after the domestic wireless provider survived the pricing wars. A recent analyst downgrade though caught the thesis off guard as record margins appear to justify a higher stock price. Walter Piecyk of BTIG Research is one of the most influential and entertaining analysts in the communications sector. Walter boldly went on CNBC to discuss his negative view on Disney (NYSE: DIS ) in the face of the Star Wars movie release and the stock declined nearly 4% on the day. His opinion is very influential to the market. Back on December 15, Walter downgraded Verizon to a Neutral based on the theory that wireless margins are at a peak. He provided the following chart via Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) that backs my thesis of the company surviving the pricing wars. The main reason BTIG has turned neutral on Verizon is a belief that the wireless provider has reported substantially increased EBITDA margins due to phone payment plan benefits that will end next year. For this reason, Walter is predicting that earnings decline in the next couple of years. This prediction doesn't match consensus or the forecast by Verizon of flat growth in 2016 before starting back up in 2017. The accounting is confusing with the shift in payment plans from a subsidized method to monthly payments. Walter argues that EBITDA numbers will decline next year leading to a below consensus EPS of $3.89. What isn't clear is how BTIG is handing the expense side of the equation. The different payment plans from a subsidized method to monthly payments to leased phones impacts the revenue method and timing of cash flows, but doesn't appreciably impact the long-term profits of the business. Whether or not the wireless margins are peaking, Verizon is a cheap stock. The stock trades at only 11x 2016 consensus EPS estimates with a solid 5% dividend yield. Considering the aggressive marketing of Sprint (NYSE: S ) and even T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS ), the above margins speak to the impressive position of Verizon. The wireless operations might not see higher margins, but the stock only needs proof of stable profits for gains. Verizon generated free cash flow that doubled the dividend payouts in the last three quarters. With a flat stock and improving results over the last three years is not the time to dump the stock. The biggest concern with Verizon now is that the company makes the incredibly dumb move to purchase Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ). The CEO clearly stated to the market the interest in reviewing the company as it separates the Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) stake. The recommendation is that investors continue owning Verizon with an alert eye on the future financial impacts of the phone plans. The 5% dividend yield for the stable cash flows of Verizon are too attractive to pass up. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
