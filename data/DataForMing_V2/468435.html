2 Surprises From The iPhone SE - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha The iPhone SE is rumored to be selling around 18% of iPhone units. This will have a large impact on reported revenues and reported number of iPhone sold. On the other hand, when it comes to margins, this also led me to something of a surprise. When Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) reported Q2 FY2016 earnings , it provided the following guidance for Q3 FY2016 (to be reported on July 26): Gross margin between 37.5 percent and 38 percent This compared to $50.6 billion in revenues on sales of 51.2 million iPhones at an ASP of $641 each. This and the remaining product lines produced a gross margin of 39.4%. As per Apple, Q2 FY2016 didn't yet include any iPhone SE revenues. However, for Q3 FY2016, reports are that the iPhone SE represented a significant share of iPhone revenues, indeed leading to iPhone production being up sequentially (by 13%, according to telecompaper.com ). Also according to the same source, out of 48 million iPhone produced in the quarter, 9 million (or 18.75%) were iPhone SEs. Flat to up production for the quarter is somewhat surprising since Apple's guidance (at midpoint) implies a 17% sequential drop in revenues, much of which is to come from lower iPhone sales. For reference, Apple's Q3 FY2015 saw a sequential drop in iPhone sales of 22.2% which itself was the main factor in an overall 14.5% sequential drop in revenues. Thus, it would seem that if this flat to up sequential iPhone production is true, then iPhone sales stand to decline less than expected sequentially - all on account of the iPhone SE (whose Q3 FY2016 production largely exceeds the sequential growth in overall iPhone production). First implied surprise here: Apple has a good likelihood of beating the revenue and "iPhones sold" estimates for Q3 FY2016, entirely on iPhone SE sales (if production has translated to sales). However, there is more to this story. Apple's gross margin guidance represents a sequential 165 bps drop. But what is the effect if 18% of iPhone sales are iPhone SEs? As we saw in my article titled "Apple: If iPhone Keeps Shrinking ," the iPhone should roughly represent around 80% of Apple's gross margin. My model also shows the iPhone as having a gross margin of ~49.5% (after fixed cost allocation). The iPhone SE is estimated to have a $160 BOM (Bill of Materials), whereas the iPhone 6s had an estimated $227 BOM. Apple's ASP (Average Selling Price) during Q2 FY2016 was $641, which is close to the base price of the iPhone 6s. The iPhone SE, however, has a much lower base price ($399). Given the much lower price, what does this mean for the iPhone SE's gross margins? Instinctively we would think that they would be much lower. It is here that I came with my second surprise. Its margins that aren't much lower than Apple's previous iPhone margins. As I said, I found those to be ~49.5% after fixed cost allocation (which I assumed would the same percent per phone). Using the same logic with the iPhone SE, this brought me to its gross margin being 44.4%. Lower, for sure, but not incredibly lower (10% lower margins on a 38% lower price). Thus, the overall iPhone gross margin would go from 49.5% to around (18%x44.4% + 82%x49.5%) = 48.6%. Since this applies to 80% of Apple's gross margin, the impact on overall gross margin would be 80% x (49.5% - 48.6%) or 0.73%. Notice that this ignores mix shift effects (other than the SE conquering 18% of the mix). How does this 0.73% impact compare with guidance? Well, guidance was for a gross margin drop of 1.65%. As such, the impact from the iPhone SE alone seems lower than implied by guidance. Of course, it should also be noted that since revenues are still expected to show a decline year-on-year, the mix shift is not going to be the only negative effect impacting gross margins. Apple also will have to contend with less fixed cost dilution. There are some positive effects on component costs, though. Still, we cannot look to the iPhone SE and straight out say that it will kill margins. It will have an impact, but not enough of an impact to destroy margins. On the other hand, it might have enough of an impact for Apple to meet or beat revenue consensus and "number of iPhones sold" consensus. Putting it all together, it seems likely that: Apple will beat revenue guidance on account of SE sales. This isn't entirely surprising, since even 5 million iPhone SEs would add $2 billion in revenue, never mind 9 million ($3.6 billion). Apple will show less deterioration in number of iPhone sold than expected, on account of SE units sold. Even though the iPhone SE is lower margin than the overall iPhone product line, the difference isn't so large as to destroy Apple's gross margins. This is a positive surprise.
