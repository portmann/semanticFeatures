Expect Twitter To Continue To Fall - Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) | Seeking Alpha Twitter may have reached its IPO price, but it's long-term future continues to look bleak. The product is not 'hard to use' - it simply does not have that much use in general. Basing their operational strategies on the assumption that their main problem is that the product is hard to understand will hurt Twitter in the long-term, making it an avoid/short. Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) closed at its IPO price on Thursday, and I expect it to continue its downward trajectory in the long-term. The company is a mess, and both investors and management are constantly looking for a scapegoat/excuse to explain why Twitter isn't experiencing the same levels of growth as Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), rather than acknowledging that Twitter just does not have anywhere near as much user applications as Facebook. Before it was that Dick Costolo was holding Twitter back with his lack of vision and execution abilities. This was a viewpoint I tackled in my first Twitter article . However, the biggest excuse has always been that Twitter is simply "too hard" to understand for users. Honestly, this has always struck me as absurd. Facebook has way more features than Twitter - on that basis alone, Facebook is harder for users to understand. Moreover, there isn't anything that complex about Twitter. Twitter's real problem with user growth is that many people simply don't see a use for this product. Not everyone wants to publicly announce their thoughts to the general public - which is essentially what a tweet is. Given the slowing user growth, Twitter has already drawn most of the people who want to do so. Facebook can get so many users because nearly everyone wants to stay connected with their friends. The other niche market Twitter appeals to are the people that follow the people that actually tweet (of course these people generally follow "important" people/organizations like celebrities or media). These users still technically engage with the product, even if it is on a lower level. Again, not everyone cares about what celebrities tweet about. These are the two most obvious use cases for the product, and the fact that user growth is slowing is a sign that these two markets for Twitter are becoming saturated - not that other people who would fit into one of these two groups simply can't understand how the product works. There's really no basis for saying that, given that the product is fairly simple. Until Twitter realizes that their total amount of active users isn't going to grow that much more, it's going to make the wrong moves and flounder as a business. Even if the rumors of Jack Dorsey retiring from Square to become Twitter's CEO pan out, it wouldn't change the fact that I believe investors should avoid or short the stock. After all, on the earnings call both the CFO and Dorsey talked about how the product was too difficult to use, a major red flag for me. What would have to be done to convince me that the stock is worth investing in? Realize that the heydays of user growth are gone. Twitter still has hundreds of millions of active users regardless - that's a massive amount, even if it doesn't compare that favorably to Facebook's billion plus. The focus has to be on working on monetizing the users you have, and launching new products like Periscope (and effectively monetizing those as well). Continuing to base company strategy on the assumption that the problem is that the product remains too hard to use will result in big losses for investors moving forward.
