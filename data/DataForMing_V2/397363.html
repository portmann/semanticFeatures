Interview With Apple's Tim Cook - Cramer's Mad Money (5/2/16) | Seeking Alpha Tim Cook is optimistic about China and India. High numbers have switched from Android to Apple in China in the last 6 months. Hold Under Armour for the long term. Stocks discussed on the in-depth session of Jim Cramer's Mad Money Program, Monday, May 2. What is your investment time frame? This is an important question as it changes the perspective and views on stocks. The perspective of short-term hedge fund manager Carl Icahn versus that of long-term investor Warren Buffett is totally different. Buffett mentioned that he okay losing money on IBM (NYSE: IBM ) in the short term since the long-term vision holds good for the company. He invests in America for the long term and the quarterly performances do not matter to him. On the flip side, hedge fund manager Carl Icahn tracks quarterly performances because it matters in the hedge fund world. That is why he bailed on Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) even though he expected Apple to hit $240 by 2017. Icahn was worried about China sales and hence sold his huge position in the company. Choose your time frame wisely! Both Icahn and Buffett have the same goal of outperforming the market but have different timelines. In a first for Mad Money, Cramer interviewed Apple CEO Tim Cook to get clarity on Apple's long-term vision, goals and his views on everything surrounding Apple stock. Cramer has been fan of Apple for a long time and has constantly reiterated his strategy of owning Apple and not trading it. Cramer asked Tim Cook about the disconnect between the popularity of Apple products and media claims that Apple is dead. "I think that's a huge overreaction," said Cook. Their quarter was good by absolute standards although less than the street expected. They had $50.6B in revenue and $10.5B in profits. This is $10B more than any other company makes. "People are upgrading at a lower rate than last year, but significantly higher than the year before. The combination of declined upgrades, currency rates and macroeconomic issues has its effect on the company," he added. "The most important thing is that customers love our products. The loyalty rates for Apple are higher than ever before. That is the most important thing for the long term of Apple," said Cook. 'Services' is the second largest segment at Apple. It's a fast growing segment and things like the App store will keep growing. It is based on how many devices are in use. Cook mentioned that there are more than 1B devices in use which will help this segment grow. Cook also commented on China. They are seeing alarming rates of switching from Android to Apple. Two years ago, Apple had enormous sales in China and last year growth was 80%. This year the currency was down 7% in mainland China so on a two year basis, Apple grew 70% in China. "It's hard pressed to say those aren't good results," he added. He remains excited about the launch of iPhone SE. Cook agreed that the market in China is changing. The heat in the smartphone market is dying but there is more movement between different suppliers of smartphones. "I think in the areas where we play, we are doing quite well," he added. Apple is also working with local agencies to get back online by selling books and movies to Chinese consumers. "It was my error for not talking about it. I could not be more optimistic about China. I think the long-term thesis is intact," said Cook. The expansion of the middle class in China is nothing like anything that's happened in the world before. There are 50M middle class people in China and this number could rise to 500M in 5 years. The same thesis applies to India. "This is another huge one. India will be the most populous country in the world in 2022," he said. More than half the population is 25 years old or younger. LTE penetration is still very low in India and once that happens, there is huge potential. The retailers selling iPhones in India are not huge retailers and carriers do not sell phones. Last quarter Apple saw 56% growth in India on iPhone units which is pretty big. Cook remains optimistic about Asia and the growth of emerging markets. Cook spoke about how they spend their cash. After R&D, spending on stores and M&A, what's left over goes to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. Apple is buying companies every 3-4 weeks and mainly buys great technology from great people. Cook believes the company is undervalued but they don't have a process of buying back stocks. Cook mentioned that their profits are the best in the business and they are doing it better than anyone else. Commenting on the Apple watch, Cook said that it is not a flop as the media claims. People call iPods and iPhones an overnight success but in reality they took some time to mature. The same is the case with Apple watch. It can do many things for consumers and one day people will look back and call it an overnight success. To conclude, he responded to people's criticism of Apple not doing well in emerging markets. Cook said Apple did $58B in revenue from China last year and they know how to adapt to emerging markets compared to the analysts that look at China from the lens of the US. CEO interview - Newell Brands (NYSE: NWL ) Newell just completed the acquisition of Jarden last month. Cramer interviewed Michael Polk to find out more about what the acquisition means for the company. Polk said that the company is already doing great after the close of the acquisition in April. This can be seen in the 5.6% growth in the quarter. He said that business models of Newell and Jarden were different but their culture of innovation was similar. This makes both the companies a good fit. Polk forecasts synergies of $500M between the two operations. Their objective is to become a lean company, fix whatever brands they can and sell those they cannot. In Cramer's opinion, the combination has made it a housewares powerhouse. CEO interview - International Paper (NYSE: IP ) The paper business in cyclical. Paper giant International Paper reported a great last quarter and has entered into an agreement with Weyerhaeuser (NYSE: WY ) to purchase 5 pulp mills. Cramer interviewed CEO Mark Sutton to hear more on the merger. Sutton mentioned that the new acquisition will help the company expand into products that collect and retain moisture, such as medical and personal hygiene products. The market for these products is global but manufacturing for them is US-based. The company is also working on products that are waterproof and recyclable. Sutton is seeing a pickup in the container board business which is a sign that things are improving.
