SanDisk: Is There A Bigger Bid Coming? - SanDisk Corporation (NASDAQ:SNDK) | Seeking Alpha Oct. 26, 2015 11:57 AM ET  |  About: SanDisk Corporation (SNDK) , Includes: AAPL , INTC , MU , STX , WDC by: Overbet For Value SanDisk has agreed to be acquired by Western Digital for $19 billion. Apple is very unlikely to come out with a bigger bid for SanDisk that would potentially destroy its relationships with the DRAM manufacturers. Western Digital is going to be very highly leveraged after the SanDisk deal. Seagate would have to be even more highly leveraged if it acquires SanDisk. Micron, SK Hynix, Samsung, Seagate and Apple are all unlikely to make a big bid to spoil Western Digital's party. Western Digital (NASDAQ: WDC ) has agreed to acquire SanDisk (NASDAQ: SNDK ) for $19 billion. Assuming Western Digital's previous arrangement with China's Unisplendour goes through as expected, almost all of SanDisk's payment will be received in cash. Leading up to the Western Digital-SanDisk deal, the rumor mill produced several potential acquirers of SanDisk other than Western Digital. These names included Micron (NASDAQ: MU ), Seagate (NASDAQ: STX ), Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) and SK Hynix ( OTC:HXSCF ). According to Summit Research analyst Srini Sundararajan, there is a " 50-50 chance " that one of these other companies will come out with a bigger bid for SanDisk. There was also another rumor started by B. Riley analyst Craig Ellis that stated Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) could also be interested in acquiring the biggest pure play non-volatile memory company in the world. While it isn't impossible that someone tries to spoil Western Digital's plans, I believe the odds of a bigger bid for SanDisk are much closer to 5% than 50%. M&A activity in the semiconductor industry has reached a frenzied pace in 2015. Avago (NASDAQ: AVGO ), NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ: NXPI ), Freescale (NYSE: FSL ), Broadcom (NASDAQ: BRCM ), Altera (NASDAQ: ALTR ), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) and many others have been involved in major M&A deals already this year. PMC-Sierra (NASDAQ: PMCS ) finds itself in a bidding war between Microsemi Corporation (NASDAQ: MSCC ) and Skyworks (NASDAQ: SWKS ). I just don't see a similar bidding war emerging for SanDisk. Micron and Western Digital were rumored to be in discussions to acquire SanDisk for the last few weeks. While a Micron acquisition of SanDisk would eliminate a member of the NAND oligopoly and bring about a higher concentration of power in the industry, Micron's main benefit from acquiring SanDisk would be SanDisk's joint fab capacity that it shares with Toshiba. SanDisk would get to abandon its effort with Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ ) to jointly develop a next generation NVM (non-volatile memory) that will try to match the performance characteristics of Micron and Intel's 3D XPoint. A Micron-SanDisk combination could also abandon the expensive effort to roll out SanDisk's BiCS. Assuming a deal is mostly financed in cash, Micron would also likely see a short-term boost in earnings and free cash flow. While SanDisk's fab capacity would be nice to have for Micron, SanDisk's IP (intellectual property) is unlikely to be of significant value to Micron. Micron seems to be pleased with its 3D NAND solution and 3D XPoint, which would indicate that the Idaho-based memory giant would likely just scrap SanDisk's R&D efforts in 3D NAND and next generation NVM. SanDisk's planar NAND has significantly better cost per bit metrics than that of Micron's planar NAND, but the era of 3D NAND is quickly approaching. Micron is set to leapfrog SanDisk (as well as SK Hynix and Samsung) to reach the top of the list of companies in terms of cost per bit for NAND by the end of 2016 (or early 2017). On top of the lack of significant value that Micron sees in SanDisk's IP, Micron would also likely have to deal with the objections of regulatory agencies in the US (DOJ and FTC) and abroad, which would add delays and additional costs that a Western Digital-SanDisk tie up may be able to avoid. SanDisk shares fabs with Toshiba and it seems highly unlikely that Micron would be willing to share its 3D NAND (and 3D XPoint) architecture with rival Toshiba. It also seems unlikely that Toshiba would want to share its IP with Micron (and Intel) too. The only way to avoid this would be either Micron or Intel also acquiring Toshiba concurrently with a Micron-SanDisk merger. A Micron-SanDisk merger would already be complicated as is. Another deal with Toshiba would just compound the difficulties of getting a deal through (for financial, technological and regulatory reasons). Western Digital highly values SanDisk's IP and fab capacity. With Micron subtracting out the value of SanDisk's IP, adding costs related to delays resulting from regulatory activity, adding a premium relative to Western Digital's big bid and potentially lowering future gross margins due to sharing IP with Toshiba, Micron would have to value SanDisk's fab capacity at significantly more than $19 billion. There is also the sticky issue of having to get Toshiba and Intel to not vehemently protest, which seems unlikely to me. As a result, I believe there is close to no chance that Micron will present a bid that is better than what Western Digital has offered. Samsung made a $5.8 billion bid for SanDisk in 2008 and subsequently pulled the offer. Unlike Micron, there's a chance that Samsung can find value in both SanDisk's fabs and IP. Currently, Samsung is paying royalties to SanDisk for use of SanDisk's NAND patents. This cost could be eliminated with a SanDisk acquisition. Samsung is likely experiencing significant problems with its 3D NAND product that it has been shipping for over a year already. In the event that Samsung cannot cost effectively fix their issues with V-NAND, the Korean electronics giant could scrap its 3D NAND architecture and join SanDisk and Toshiba with BiCS. On the R&D side, it is highly probable that both Samsung and SanDisk are both hard at work on trying to find a response to Micron and Intel's 3D XPoint as soon as possible. By merging, the two NAND giants could focus their collective efforts on one next generation NVM architecture, which could lead to both shortening the time it takes to develop a next generation NVM as well as a potential huge cost savings of not having to run two separate development efforts. For unknown reasons, the 2008 bid from Samsung for SanDisk appeared to have led to minimal dialogue between the two. Samsung pulled its offer because of "SanDisk's refusal to entertain friendly discussions." SanDisk stated that it was Samsung who was uninterested to begin discussions on a possible merger. SanDisk also stated, "We believe this raises questions about the real motivation behind Samsung's offer." Whatever prevented even holding discussions in 2008 seems to present the possibility that a repeat in 2015 could occur even if Samsung and SanDisk were interested in a possible deal. The regulatory issues a Micron-SanDisk deal would have would only be magnified for a possible Samsung-SanDisk merger. While a Samsung-SanDisk deal offers more synergistic value than a Micron-SanDisk deal, the odds of a big Samsung offer for SanDisk now seem remote at best. An SK Hynix deal for SanDisk makes a lot more sense than a Samsung or Micron bid. Hynix has the weakest position in NAND of the major manufacturers and SanDisk currently has the strongest. Since SanDisk does not produce DRAM and Hynix is one of the big three in manufacturing DRAM, a single entity consisting of SK Hynix and SanDisk could make a very cost-competitive MCP (Multi Chip Package) consisting of mobile DRAM and NAND for the smartphone market. Seventy percent of mobile phones will have MCPs this year. As separate entities, SK Hynix and SanDisk would face significant risk of not being able to produce competitively-priced MCPs once Micron ramps up production of its low cost 3D NAND. Hynix's ability to scrap its own 3D NAND and next generation NVM development in favor of SanDisk's current NVM architectures would present significant cost savings. Risk of regulatory interference exists, but it is significantly less than that of potential bids from Micron or Samsung. In the comments section of my previous article, " SanDisk: The Acquisition Target ," the issue of Toshiba (SanDisk's fab partner in producing NAND) having trouble working with a Korean company was thoroughly discussed. While Japanese-Korean relations may not be ideal, I do not think it would be a major issue that would prevent a deal so long as the financial terms of the deal makes sense for everyone involved. While I see an SK Hynix bid as far more likely than a Samsung or Micron bid, it is hard to fathom the possibility of SK Hynix putting in an offer higher than $19 billion. Seagate would love nothing more than to drive up the price of SanDisk for Western Digital. Western Digital is going to become very highly leveraged if it must pay close to $19 billion in cash to close the deal. The combined Western Digital-SanDisk would create a company that initially has a negative tangible book value after Western Digital borrows up to $18.4 billion to finance this transaction. Seagate is already a more highly levered firm than Western Digital, and it seems unlikely that Seagate would be willing to become as insanely highly levered as it would have to be to create a compelling offer for SanDisk shareholders. Seagate would get the same benefits as Western Digital would with an acquisition of a giant NAND manufacturer, an ability to transition to a major SSD manufacturer in the post-HDD era (whenever that happens). However, a bid in excess of $19 billion would be difficult to pull off. Western Digital has a cleaner balance sheet than Seagate and also has a Chinese friend that may potentially be involved in financing the bid for SanDisk. Seagate does not have that luxury and will likely be unable to offer a significant premium over the mostly cash bid from its long-time arch-rival. There are some potential benefits for Apple if it is able to successfully acquire SanDisk. The memory industry is cyclical and prices of NAND can (and will) fluctuate significantly over time. While predicting the costs of producing NAND is fairly easy to do for a NAND producer, estimating the trajectory of the price per GB of NAND has been extremely difficult for everyone. As a result of a SanDisk acquisition, Apple could get some cost certainty (and more importantly supply guarantee) in a critical storage component in its iPhone, iPad and whatever electronic devices that the company will dream up in the future. The above chart represents SanDisk's revenues by segment. (The numbers don't add up to 100% always due to rounding. These numbers were pulled directly from SanDisk's quarterly filing in July .) It becomes pretty obvious that SanDisk's mix of end market demand for its NAND does not even remotely resemble the mix of end markets of Apple products that require NAND. It is important to note NAND is not just one type of memory product. There are actually several subcategories of products (under the NAND umbrella) including SLC, MLC and TLC as well as modifications to that NAND to suit the various end products the memory dies will end up in (USB flash drives, memory cards, SSDs. etc.) While close to all of SanDisk's revenue comes from selling NAND (if you ignore royalties), this revenue is actually derived from many separate products that are not interchangeable. Certainly, Apple could modify the mix of SanDisk's output to more closely match the needs of its iDevices. That will take time. However, it is inevitable that Apple will have to continue selling NAND-based products to other electronics companies as well as directly to consumers. Apple (with its new partner Toshiba) will become the fourth NAND giant. Unlike a possible Micron acquisition of SanDisk, an Apple acquisition of SanDisk is unlikely to draw objections from SanDisk's joint venture partner Toshiba. Apple's relationship with Samsung has been strained for many years now. While Apple's smartphones, tablets and Macs compete directly with Samsung's versions of those products, Samsung has been a supplier of critical components of these Apple products, including DRAM (in its many forms) and the fabrication of Apple's A series SoCs. By acquiring SanDisk, Apple will be entering another market in direct competition with Samsung. That really is not too significant as this strange relationship was and will likely remain tense for the foreseeable future. By acquiring SanDisk, Apple will now be in direct competition with the other two major NAND manufacturers, Micron and SK Hynix. This would not be a major concern if Micron, SK Hynix and Samsung did not completely control the DRAM market. Again, Apple would find itself in competition with suppliers of essential components of all of its products. Apple has been a customer of Samsung for many years and has been able to avoid punitively absurd prices because Apple has always had other (friendly) options (albeit inferior options at times) when it comes to DRAM, NAND and its SOCs. Unless there are some major advances in the performance (endurance and speed) of 3D XPoint or some yet to be announced memory solution, DRAM will continue to be an absolute necessity in virtually all iDevices for the foreseeable future. Does Apple really want to make an acquisition that will impair its relationship with all three manufacturers of a component that is absolutely necessary to build all of its iDevices? Apple can and has used its weight as the 800-pound gorilla to get preferential treatment from its suppliers. However, Micron, SK Hynix and Samsung are not like Cirrus Logic or Omnivision Technologies. The three DRAM manufacturers have formed a powerful memory oligopoly that could severely hamper Apple's business by restricting the amount of DRAM Apple gets when the cyclical DRAM market eventually finds itself inevitably undersupplied again. Apple is able to receive preferential pricing from its suppliers on many components. However, Apple is unlikely to get this treatment on next generation NVM (non-volatile memory) in the short-intermediate term. 3D XPoint is not yet available, but will begin rolling out sometime in 2016. There have been no major announcements from SanDisk, Samsung or SK Hynix that point to these three memory giants rolling out their respective version of next generation NVMs in the near future. It's not difficult to imagine a world where Micron and Intel either completely control this next generation NVM market or find themselves significantly ahead on cost and performance relative to their competitors. In this pseudo-monopoly structure (assuming partners Micron and Intel act rationally together), Micron and Intel have all the power in negotiations. While 3D XPoint will initially likely be used mostly in IMDB and data centers, it is hard to imagine that XPoint will not eventually find its way into the standard memory hierarchy of consumer electronics (sometime after the 2018 timeframe). Does Apple really want to be a direct competitor to the companies that may be the only viable producer of next generation NVM in the not too distant future? I don't think so. Apple is more than a technology company now. It is a fashion brand. On top of straining important supplier relationships, Apple is unlikely to acquire SanDisk simply because the biggest electronics company in the world has little to no interest in selling flash drives, memory cards, SSDs and other commodity products that are unlikely to command premium pricing from Apple branding. Enterprise customers aren't going to pay huge premiums for an Apple logo on SSDs. While I underestimated Apple's ability to maintain significantly inflated margins on its smartphones and tablets, it is probably safe to assume that nobody other than the craziest of Apple fanboys will pay enormous premiums for a USB flash drive with an Apple logo. An acquisition of SanDisk might lower Apple's cost of NAND in the short-term (assuming Apple acquires SanDisk at a reasonably low price). However, it is highly probable (in my view) that SanDisk is about to lose its position as the lowest cost producer of NAND. When Micron and Intel start producing their 3D NAND product in high volume starting in 2016, SanDisk could find its relative position in NAND significantly impaired. On top of the Micron and Intel solution, Samsung's V-NAND could also prove to be a lower cost NAND (relative to SanDisk's BiCS) solution when the planar NAND era comes to an end. The big four NAND manufacturers each have a different 3D NAND architecture and the cost per bit (and performance) of each memory may be vastly different. There's a good chance that SanDisk's solution is inferior to that of (some of) its competitors, which would only further disincentivize Apple from acquiring SanDisk as the cost of alienating the other memory manufacturers would only get higher. In the most optimistic scenario, I do not believe Apple could realize anything more than minimal cost savings by building NAND in-house (via a SanDisk acquisition) instead of buying it from a third party. Even if Apple has some interest in acquiring SanDisk, it is highly unlikely that Apple would put in a bid of over $19 billion. Just because Apple has a 12-digit cash reserve does not mean that it will be willing to significantly overpay for the value that SanDisk brings to Apple. SanDisk adds little value for Apple in the long term. For Western Digital, SanDisk represents a potential lifeline when the HDD market inevitably collapses (in a couple years down the road). SanDisk is a nice to have for Apple at best. (I am not even sure if it is a nice to have for Apple.) Western Digital likely views SanDisk as critically important to its technology roadmap. As a result, I suspect the probability of an Apple acquisition of SanDisk is very low and probably far worse than 100-1 odds. In the end, I believe SanDisk's shareholders are very fortunate to get the big bid from Western Digital. It's a great offer and I highly doubt there will be a surprise offer that initiates a bidding war for SanDisk. Western Digital's acquisition of SanDisk will likely be immediately accretive to earnings and free cash flow each quarter. However. the bloated balance sheet loaded with debt poses significant long-term risk if Western Digital-SanDisk are unable to keep up with Samsung, Micron and Intel in the move to 3D NAND and SSDs. There is potential for the new company to end up with an inferior position in the NVM cost curve coupled with large interest payments. While short-term prospects may have marginally improved, I would avoid Western Digital as a long-term investment. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
