Apple: We May See 3 New iPhones In September - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple needs to continue its iPhone momentum. Best way to achieve growth is for three different models. Last week, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) reported another strong quarter , thanks to more than 61 million iPhone sales. The larger screen iPhone 6 has been a huge hit with consumers. As the company's recent 10-Q filing details, unit sales of the smartphone are up 43% in the first six months of the fiscal year, as compared to the prior year period. The iPhone has shown great growth in recent years, as seen in the table below. Q1 of 2012 is highlighted as it contained an extra week in the fiscal period. IDC estimated that Apple's 61.2 million iPhones sold in calendar Q1 (fiscal Q2) was good for an 18.2% global smartphone share, up from 15.2% a year earlier. Apple's revenue share was likely above 40% according to estimates. Total smartphone shipments were reportedly up 16.7% in the period, well below the 39.9% growth Apple saw for the iPhone. Many are wondering what comes next for the company's flagship device, as we'll be due for a new iPhone launch in a little more than four months. I believe the best solution for Apple is to launch three new models of the smartphone. The 2015 refresh of the iPhone is going to be an interesting one to watch. Two years ago, Apple decided to go with a two phone launch, the iPhone 5C and 5S, and you can see the complete history of the device here . Those two models contained a 4 inch display, which was the largest for the iPhone to that point. Last year, the iPhone 6 had a 4.7 inch display, and the 6 Plus had a 5.5 inch display. While consumers have liked larger screens on their phones, this has hurt the tablet market a bit. Apple reported a 20% drop in iPad unit sales for the first half of the fiscal year, with many believing the iPad mini has been especially hurt by the 6 Plus. When Apple decides to launch its new set of iPhones later this year, I don't think the company can just hope that it produces more market share gains. I do think we will see a fair share of the current 5S/5C holders switch to the larger screen devices, so that will certainly help. However, there are probably a decent amount of those phone people that like the 4 inch size of the 5S/5C and don't want a giant phone. When you are selling roughly 200 million or so units a year, if even 5% want a smaller version, you're talking about 10 million potential sales. You can't ignore those consumers. This is the perfect time for Apple to go with three new phones. Apple can launch two new larger screen phones, and we'll call them the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus for now. Eventually, I think Apple will need a new naming system, because I don't think in a few years consumers will be out celebrating the "iPhone 12". The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus would be the same screen size as the 6 and 6 Plus, but would have upgraded specs. Apple would then discontinue the 5S/5C, but could use those production lines to produce a 4 inch model with upgraded specs, and this would be the third model. We'll call it the "7 Mini" for this argument. Thus, we would have new models with screen sizes of 4, 4.7, and 5.5 inches. Apple might also decide to stay with the 6 and 6 Plus, discounting these models a bit. A key part of this decision would be pricing of these models. The iPhone 6 launched for $199, $299, and $399 for the 16GB, 64GB, and 128GB models, respectively, with a two year contract. The 6 Plus models went for $100 more than their 6 counterparts. Apple will most likely keep these pricing tiers in place for the "7 and 7 Plus". However, I think it can launch this new "7 mini" for $149 and up, based on the upgraded hardware. This would basically be halfway between the original pricing of the 5S and 5C, and would allow Apple to mostly keep up its high average selling prices of the iPhone. While you might see a slightly hit to ASPs, maybe 1% or 2%, it would certainly be worth it if it helps boost your unit sales by say 5% or more. Considering the decent margins Apple maintains on the iPhone, the goal here is to boost unit sales and total revenues of the device, and this strategy would do just that. For Apple to keep its iPhone unit sales growth going later this year, the company may decide to launch three new versions of the smartphone. Consumers definitely loved the larger screen of the iPhone 6, and it is time for the initial buyers of the 5C/5S to upgrade. Some of those people may prefer a smaller screen, and Apple already has the production lines in place to launch to pull off this three model launch. Giving consumers three screen sizes should help with unit sales growth, allowing those who want a smaller screen or cheaper phone to get what they want. For Apple shares to continue toward a trillion dollar market cap, the iPhone needs to keep growing, and this is the way to do it.
