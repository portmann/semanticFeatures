A Super 'Simple Dumb Model' To Value Yahoo - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha Discounting cash flows is hard. Forecasting them is even harder. Fortunately, discounted cash flows are no longer needed in order to value shares of Yahoo! All you really need to do is make a good guess at what the board was up to this past weekend. Anyone can do it. So, without further ado, I give you my Super "Simple Dumb Model" which you can use to value your own shares of Yahoo! Have you heard? Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) is the new black. The last thing the Internet needs is another article about Yahoo. Nevertheless, I'll give it a go. A lot has been in the news. So let's get caught up first. The web is littered with chatter about what the "sum of the parts" are worth. Tanveer Signgh did what looks like a nice job here . This is a reasonable way to think about valuation. First you add up their cash. Then, add in their large stakes in Yahoo Japan and Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ). Finally, subtract out their debt. What you are left with is some number. Let's call it the value of Yahoo's garage. Like, it's all the stuff that Yahoo has sitting around in their garage. Yahoo has a lot of other stuff too. Like a core bushiness that Marissa Mayer has been trying to turn around. That core business should be worth something. But what happened was kind of strange. The market price of Yahoo's stock started trading below the value of all the stuff it had just sitting in the garage. So then you get some headlines that are all like "Is Yahoo's core business really worth $0?". (That particular one is from CNBC .) Yahoo has been dead set on spinning off their stake in Alibaba. They asked the IRS if they could do that tax free. The IRS decided not to give their opinion. Then the IRS started talking about dropping hot dog stands into pools of appreciated stock. Who knew the IRS was so colorful? Matt Levine at Bloomberg View breaks it down nicely here . But the IRS's answer was basically to lock the door, yell "we're not here," and then dig a tunnel out the back to escape. It refused to say yes, refused to say no, and "announced that it was reconsidering its ruling policy" in the hopes that no one would ask it a similar question ever again. The office of answering this particular question is closed indefinitely. This is a much worse answer than "yes," and looks sort of ugly even compared with "no." The lack of opinion didn't seem to matter much to Yahoo. They just kept going about their business. It appears they are still getting ready to spin off the Alibaba shares into a box called Abaco. This upset some activists . It also explains why shares of Yahoo were worth less than what it had laying around in the garage. Lack of an opinion from the IRS opens the door to the possibility of one day receiving a tax bill from the IRS. Yahoo analyst Bob Peck has a worst case scenario where the bill could actually turn out to be greater than 100% of the sale. You see? Worst case is 70% of what you have sitting in the garage (shares of Alibaba) becomes less than worthless. I am a big fan of Matt Levine's stuff. He seems to be ahead of the curve here. I remember reading his article from September of last year when he figured out that "Alibaba Could Buy Yahoo for Free". Yep, he pretty much had it nailed well over a year ago. If you missed it last year, you can check out last week's rehash here . His plan looks pretty optimal for Yahoo shareholders. The trick is to get rid of everything in the garage, except for the Alibaba holdings. Then Yahoo just becomes a box of Alibaba shares. Alibaba can then buy that box and retire the shares tax free. However, I tend to agree with him on the following points. Here he is again. This is a good trade. Yahoo and Alibaba should do this trade. Why won't they do this trade? One reason is that it is a little too obvious that Alibaba would be getting Yahoo (and Yahoo Japan for that matter) for free, and if you are a management team and board of directors and someone comes to you and says, "I want to buy your company for nothing," then your inclination will be to say no. Your company has to be worth something! Like, you're coming to work every day, doing stuff. Concluding that the stuff you're doing is worth nothing, or negative $8 billion depending how you count, is a little too much like staring into the abyss for most corporate executives. So with shame ruling a good plan improbable, let's assume Yahoo keeps working toward the Abaco deal. In that case, here is simple dumb model to value shares of Yahoo. A = the value of some of the stuff in the garage.The cash, the debt, and Japan shares. 38bn = the market value of the Alibaba holdings. B = the probability that the IRS would let the Abaco spin off tax free. C = the tax rate if someday the IRS decides to send them a bill. Got it? Yahoo is worth the garage, plus some probability weighted value of the spin off, less the expected tax bill. The value of the core business is assumed to be worth zero in this model. That could be an unreasonable assumption. I didn't really think about it that much. A quick glance at a company burning cash and a negative valuation in the sum of parts made me comfortable with zero. Plus, I heard dozens of executives are quitting their jobs at Yahoo. That is a pretty good proxy for insider selling. "A" was about $12bn in my mind. It was adjusted for taxes and market impact and liquidity premiums and things like that. If you plug B=70% and C=50%, you end up guessing that Yahoo is worth about $35 per share. Those are not reasonable estimates. 70% is a random guess. I'm not a tax attorney. 50% for C comes from Bob Peck's numbers on gains tax and indemnification. It's a dumb model. It might still be a good model? The stock is trading at $34.91. So at $35 we are not far off. But that's not really the point. The point is that the stuff in the garage is worth a lot relative to the core business. So much so that the value of the core business does not play a huge role in the value of Yahoo's stock. I mean, the fair value for core Yahoo is probably either so low relative to the value of the garage that it doesn't really matter, or it should be valued as a takeover target. So we can skip all the forecasting and cash flow discounting. Thank goodness! That stuff is a lot of work. Who has time for that stuff? Remember when I told you that Matt Levine had figured out over a year ago that maybe the best way for Yahoo to maximize shareholder value would be to consider selling itself to Alibaba for free? Now, imagine how surprised I was to see YHOO spike 6% last week on headlines talking about how the board is all of the sudden going to start contemplating a sale of the core business. Had they really not considered that before? It's a good option. The game plan has been sitting out there on the Internet for a year. The market should not reprice itself on these headlines. Right? I mean, prior to last week did the market think that regularly scheduled board meetings consisted of eating Popsicles and playing Twister? If that's the case then yeah, reprice Yahoo. My "Super Simple Dumb Model" for Yahoo's Shares A long time ago I decided the market is usually going to be smarter than me. It has become a kind of core principle. My investment process basically consists of trying to answer the following question. Who's the dummy? (It's usually me.) Here is what I will call my Super Simple Dumb Model for Yahoo shares. The Internet is full of goodies. There are some simple ideas (Mr. Levine often discusses his "Simple Dumb Models" in his daily column on Bloomberg View) and some more complicated ones (sum of parts and things like that). Why not combine some of that and see what happens? So here is my Super Simple Dumb Model. If you want to play along at home there is a Google spreadsheet for that. Here we go. Cash is easy. It's just the value of the cash and liquid investments ("Cash Equivalents") on the balance sheet. Yahoo has some long term debt too. We back that out. That's it. We cannot get very creative with CASH. This is where you can be as creative as you want. Tanveer Signgh went with a 7x multiple on EBITDA of $1.2bn in his analysis. Let's do an EBITDA thing too. Let's say that the value of core is EBITDA multiplied by some multiple. I call that multiple "HOPE". I just pulled the income statement from Google Finance (there is a tab in the spreadsheet for that) and summed up some of the rows. Here are the numbers. The sum of the last 12 months is $105 million. Without thinking too hard let's go with it. I assign a 1x multiple. If you are playing along at home you can make EBITA and HOPE whatever you want. As far as I know there has not been much talk about Yahoo doing anything with the stake in Yahoo Japan. So, we can give it a garage value. This is pretty straight forward. The value of the stake should be the market value (JVAL) adjusted for a liquidity premium (LPREM) and a tax rate (JTAX). JVAL is $7.8bn and if Yahoo ever wanted to sell something that big they are not likely to receive the bid price. This is the reason for LPREM and I have taken a wild guess at 10%. The sale would also generate a tax liability at something like 38% (JTAX). I am not really sure what Yahoo's cost basis is, so I just apply the tax to the entire market value less the liquidity premium. It keeps things conservative and keeps us moving along. Now for the fun part. This is for most of the marbles. Let us consider three scenarios. In the first scenario, Yahoo goes ahead with the spin off without a blessing from the IRS. We will call this scenario ABACO. The value of the stake in Alibaba in this scenario looks like this. BABA(ABACO) = BVAL - (BVAL * PTAXED * BILL) It is just the market value of the holdings (BVAL) less an expected tax payment. BVAL is just a market price on the Alibaba shares. No creativity there. The expected tax payment is BVAL times the probability of the IRS calling with a bill someday (PTAXED) and the expected size of that tax bill (BILL). I am not a tax attorney and 30% is my wild guess at PTAXED. The BILL I suppose would be something like 50%. It is the capital gains plus indemnification charges I saw in that article quoting Bob Peck. Yahoo would have to make it worth Alibaba's trouble to go through with the plan. Therefore, there is some discount involved called DEAL. Let's make it 15%. There would also be a sale of Yahoo's core. The value of that sale net of tax is called LEMON. Let's go with Mr. Levine's "extremely illustrative sample math" at $2.2bn. (This is a good opportunity to remind people they can play along at home on the spreadsheet . My numbers are just my numbers.) The third and final option for the board is to do nothing. Cancel the spin off. No sales. That would be pretty lame. BABA(LAME) = BVAL * (1-LPREM) * (1-JTAX)] This is just like JAPAN all over again. It is a garage value for the Alibaba stake. The market value of the Alibaba stake adjusted for market impact and a tax liability. Nothing fancy here. Now that we have our three mutually exclusive scenarios we can play with their probabilities. PABA is the probability that Yahoo goes for the ABACO option. The value of the Alibaba stake is just a probability weighted average of all three. I went with 70% for PABA. It seems pretty likely they will just stay the course. There is also this article . There we have it. A fair value model for YHOO and not a single discounted cash flow! There is a Google spreadsheet out there and anyone can make their own best guess. Just plug values into the yellow boxes and find out what Yahoo is worth to you. Enjoy!
