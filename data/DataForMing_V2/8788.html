Is Apple Shifting More Toward A Luxury Brand In Some Markets? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Besides the introduction of new products, Apple quietly raised the price of its existing products in several countries. Many people believe that the price hike was a reaction to the strong U.S. dollar. Besides the introduction of the Apple Watch and the new MacBook last week, many investors probably overlooked that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) quietly raised prices of several existing products in many countries all around the world. For example, according to MacRumors : A spot check of the Apple Online Store in Canada ... reveals that Apple has increased the price of the unlocked iPhone 6 from between $749-$969 to $839-$1,099, Thunderbolt Displays from $999 to $1,199, and 15-inch Retina MacBook Pros from between $2,099-$2,699 to $2,449-$3,049. Apple also hiked the price on the 15-inch MacBook Pro in France, with the base model now starting at €2,249 up from €1,999, and the higher-spec model up to €2,799 from €2,499. To find out whether these price hikes were really due to the strengthening U.S. dollar as it is generally assumed, I decided to construct a table with U.S. dollar prices of the basic model of iPhone 6 in various countries, as revenue from the sale of iPhones account for more than half of Apple's total revenue. Because the taxation systems of these countries differ significantly, I also constructed a relative price comparison of the iPhone 6 without the value-added tax (goods and services tax), or in other words a variation of the popular Big Mac index. The results of both calculations are captured in the charts below. The first chart shows the differences in U.S. dollars between the price of iPhone 6 (16 GB) in the U.S. online Apple Store and the prices of the same product in online Apple Stores in selected countries as of March 11, right after the global price increase of the company's products. Apparently, the place where you can buy the iPhone 6 and presumably all other Apple products at their cheapest is its mother country, as all the differences are positive. Anywhere else on the planet, particularly in Brazil, the prices of Apple products are substantially higher. This chart is primarily valuable for consumers; however, it tells us nothing about the international parity of Apple products prices, because of hefty taxes and tariffs in some countries. The second chart is more rewarding. It captures a relative price comparison of the iPhone 6 (16GB) to the same date after VAT/GST deduction. Similar to the Big Mac index, it also shows by how much the local currency would have to appreciate or depreciate to make the iPhone cost the same as it does in the U.S. As we can see, even after VAT/GST deduction, the purchasing power parity does not hold and iPhones in many countries are still more expensive than in the U.S. How is this possible? One probable explanation could be that Apple took into account some estimates of future rates, because it does not intend to change prices very often. Nevertheless, in some countries like China, the standard deviation from the U.S. price is simply too large. Moreover, the Chinese central bank has long been criticized for interventions in favor of local exporters, so the Renminbi should naturally be undervalued against U.S. dollar. This suggests that Apple's new strategy might in some particular countries be a shift towards a more luxury and exclusive brand. And especially in the highly competitive Chinese market, it would be a logical step. To sum up the thesis, the recent price hike for Apple products is probably partly a test of consumers' adaption to higher prices and not solely an adjustment for the strengthening U.S. dollar. As many loyal Apple customers might be willing to pay even double the price the products cost now, we can expect that Apple sales won't be affected by this price shift and margins will improve, which will already positively impact the next earnings. Without doubt, Apple stock still has a lot of space to grow. Source: Is Apple Shifting More Toward A Luxury Brand In Some Markets? Disclosure: The author is long AAPL.
