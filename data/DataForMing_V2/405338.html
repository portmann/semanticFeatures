Buy Disney After The Sell-Off - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha DIS posted a strong quarter to my eye but investors are disappointed. ESPN has weakened but Disney continues to grow anyway, driven by great content. Disney (NYSE: DIS ) has been one of my favorite longs in the entire market over the last couple of years. The company's ecosystem of entertainment that creates a virtuous cycle of profits is unbelievably attractive and I have a lot of respect for CEO Iger and his vision for driving the company forward. That worked out well for the run from $80 to $120, but in recent months, DIS has failed to reclaim its highs. Indeed, the stock has been very weak at times and in the days leading up to the Q2 earnings report, was trading at a recent high of $106. But after disappointing investors, DIS is back near $100 as investors digest what amounts to a disappointing report. With Disney investors feeling a bit like the lovable Sadness character above, does that mean that DIS is a buy here or has the magical run ended? Disney's success over the past few years has done what it has to many other companies before. Expectations are so high that it can be difficult to satiate investors even if record earnings are produced. Disney continues to post very strong results in its film division but the TV business has been weaker for a while. "Weak" by Disney standards means flat so we must keep things in perspective but the point stands that flat isn't good enough for investors in DIS shares. That is why the stock is getting hammered off of the Q2 report but is that a good enough reason to dump it for longer-term holders? When looking at the price action of the stock off of the report, you'd think DIS posted a huge drop in revenue and profits but if you simply look at the numbers, there is no cause for panic. Revenue was up 4%, segment operating profits were up 10%, adjusted EPS was up 11% and FCF was up 12%. What in the world do people want? Those numbers sound very strong to me and I suspect there are many companies that would love to be able to post a quarter like that. Disney has been doing this for years and while the law of large numbers has slowed its absolute growth, killing the stock because of a slight miss of high expectations seems a bit shortsighted to me. The studio business is obviously gangbusters right now (again) as DIS continues to pump out mega-hit after mega-hit. That is a big reason why I'm bullish on Disney; the studio business drives profitability for not only that segment, but merchandise and spin-offs to other segments. It is all about content for DIS and the studio business produces the best content in the world. As long as that's true, DIS will be hard to stop. The media networks business posted fractionally lower revenue during Q2 but profits were up 9%. Obviously, ESPN is a big concern for investors as it has been a major cash cow for DIS for as long as I can remember. The thing is that ESPN is still a cash cow and while it may not be producing growth like it once did, it is ludicrous to write off the company's future because ESPN is weaker than it used to be. Every great business reaches a point where it has become so successful that it simply cannot grow any longer. I think ESPN reached that point last year some time so of course growth is going to be difficult to come by. The key thing to remember is that Disney is not a TV company. It has a tremendously diversified revenue stream that can pick up the slack if one of its segments is weak. That's what bears don't understand. Disney also announced it would shutter its video game unit, a move that is long past due. I've always hated Disney's video game unit because it has never worked. The unit destroyed value and never resonated with consumers so while I wish it had been shut a while back, we can now move forward without it. The $147M charge is ugly but DIS can bid good riddance to its weakest unit and come out the other side stronger. Revenue is expected to rise by mid- to high-single digits for the foreseeable future, something that I find very reasonable. This quarter was slightly below that and while shutting the video game unit will take a minor toll on total revenue, it was still the right move. At any rate, I suspect analysts will revise these estimates down in the coming days and that should reset expectations favorably for bulls. All the negativity surrounding Disney's revenue streams could set the company up to beat expectations for the remainder of this fiscal year and into next fiscal year. The bottom line is that with the lineup of movies coming out in the next couple of years, Disney's revenue is hardly at risk. Disney's profitability has never been in question as the company's ability to turn revenue into profits continues to improve. That's key and as I mentioned earlier, the relatively weak revenue picture for Q2 was more than offset by strong profit growth. After all, the point of a business isn't to make revenue; the point is to make profit. Disney continues to find levers to pull to grow profitability well in excess of revenue growth and there is no reason to think that won't continue. The studio business will continue to drive strong profit growth for years to come and if analysts revise EPS estimates down off of the Q2 report, it will be a gift to investors. At just 16.1 times next year's earnings, DIS is very cheap again. This is a company that is going to continue to grow earnings at or near the low double-digit mark for the foreseeable future as the studio division and the media business continue to chug along. The addition of the Shanghai park should further bolster the parks business and produce some growth there as well, helping bridge the gap left by weak ad revenue at ESPN. The point is that the ecosystem of content and revenue/profit generation at DIS is alive and well and to presume otherwise from a +4% revenue quarter is bizarre. This company is as strong as ever and while I'd like to see ESPN's results improve, the fact is that no business can grow forever. The good news is that there are plenty of other businesses that DIS is growing to pick up the slack. I welcome the chance to buy DIS at $101 because it is going higher long term; nothing has changed there. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
