On October 27, I wrote an article about Multi-Fineline Electronix (NASDAQ: MFLX ), arguing that considering its compelling valuation metrics and high earnings growth prospects, the stock was extremely undervalued. Meanwhile, the company delivered strong results for its third quarter, and MFLX stock has gained 22.7% since my recommendation. Year to date, the stock is already up 103.3%, while the S&P 500 Index has increased 1.5% and the Nasdaq Composite Index has gained 7.8%. However, in my opinion, the shares still have room to grow. On November 05, Multi-Fineline Electronix reported its third-quarter 2015 financial results, which beat EPS expectations by a big margin of $0.22 (62.9%). The company showed significant earnings per share surprise in all its last five quarters, as shown in the table below. Net income of $13.7 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, increased 131% from $5.9 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, in the same period last year. Net sales for third quarter 2015 were $165.7 million, in line with the company's guidance range, compared to $172.9 million for the same period last year. In the report, Reza Meshgin, chief executive officer of MFLEX, commented: With outstanding operational execution during the third quarter, we achieved our fifth consecutive quarter of strong profitability with earnings per share more than doubling year-over-year. We saw a sequential increase in net sales driven by new programs that ramped during the third quarter. Gross margin also increased sequentially and exceeded our guidance range as we effectively managed the launch and ramp of these new programs. Additionally, we generated strong cash flows during the quarter, growing our cash position to $168.5 million, an all-time high for MFLEX. (Source: Current Investor Presentation ) I was impressed by the improvement of MFLX's gross margin in the last quarter. Gross margin was at 13.6%, compared to 10.1% in the same period of the prior year, and exceeding the company's guidance range. The 3.5% increase in gross margin was primarily due to a favorable product mix, as well as lower manufacturing overhead. Since Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is by far the company's largest customer, it is important to study the trend of net sales to Apple. In the table below, I have put together MFLX's net sales in the last three quarters, the percentage of sales to Apple, and net dollars sales to Apple. The table clearly demonstrates that while MFLX's net sales grew 8.5% in the last quarter compared to the previous quarter, sales to Apple grew much more at 20.5%. Moreover, compared to the first quarter, its net sales grew 11.1%, while sales to Apple grew 36.8%. On the one hand, it is quite impressive the company's sales growth to Apple. However, on the other hand, it demonstrates the high dependence of MFLX on this crucial customer. Since smartphones comprised 71% of the company's net sales in the third quarter, it also shows that Apple has increased buying MFLX's products for its iPhones, which is a good sign for Apple too. Tablet accounted for 10% of net sales in the last quarter. Additionally, MFLX had approximately 17% contribution from its consumer electronics sector, including wearable devices. The company is well positioned to benefit from the growing demand for wearables devices. According to IDC, the globally addressable wearables market is projected to grow at an average annual rate of 43% in the next five years. Flexible printed circuits are well suited for wearables given their complexity and the need to be light and bendable. Flexible printed circuits are essential also for many other applications, including smartwatches, headsets, gaming devices, fitness bands, smart-clothing and medical devices. As such, we can expect growing demand for MFLX products. Considering its compelling valuation metrics and high earnings growth prospects, the stock, in my opinion, is significantly undervalued. Multi-Fineline Electronix generates strong free cash flow; its price-to-free cash flow ratio is very low at 7.66, the sixth lowest among all 296 Russell 2000 tech stocks, and the company has no debt at all. The trailing P/E is very low at 11.30, the forward P/E is very low at 12.97 and the price-to-sales ratio is also very low at 0.82. The Enterprise Value/EBITDA ratio is exceptionally low at 1.86, and the PEG ratio is extremely low at 0.75. The PEG ratio - price/earnings-to-growth ratio - is a widely used indicator of a stock's potential value. It is favored by many investors over the P/E ratio because it also accounts for growth.
