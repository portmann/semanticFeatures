Intel: Low Expectations As Earnings Approach - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Analysts below Intel's Q3 revenue guidance midpoint. IDC reports Q3 PC sales fell more than expected. On Tuesday afternoon, we'll get a third quarter earnings report from Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ). While shares of the company recently crossed $32 for the first time since June, expectations seem to be low as the PC market remains weak. In this article, I preview the company's earnings report, discussing the major items investors need to watch for. Analysts are currently looking for $14.23 billion in Q3 revenues, down 2.2% from the prior-year period. While this number is within Intel's range for the quarter, analysts are a little below the $14.3 billion midpoint management guided to. On the bottom line, analysts are looking for EPS of $0.59, down from $0.66 in the 2014 period. Using Intel's guidance and the most recent quarterly diluted share count, the company roughly forecast $0.60 in EPS for the period. The first major item investors will be looking at is what management has to say about the PC space. IDC recently reported a 10.8% drop in Q3 sales, larger than its projection for 9.2%. On the other hand, Gartner estimated a 7.7% fall. IDC reports that the PC channel was focused on clearing Windows 8 inventory ahead of the Windows 10 launch. While reviews of the new operating system have been favorable, it seems a number of existing users have taken advantage of Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) upgrade program. Thus, sales of new hardware have been soft so far, according to IDC. The PC industry represents Intel's largest revenue and profit center, so any weakness will pressure results. Perhaps the most important item I'm watching for is a discussion on how Intel's mobile efforts are coming. During the Q2 conference call , Intel CFO Stacy Smith gave the following statement: "Tablet unit volumes were 9.9 million units, up 11% year over year. We are on track to our annual goal of improving mobile profitability by $800 million, with about a third of the improvement realized to date." That statement implies that roughly 2/3rd of profitability improvement will come in the second half of the year. Recently, Digitimes reported that Intel was planning to end price discounts for its Bay Trail tablet CPUs in October. If this is true, you would expect a significant amount of loss improvement in Q4, meaning Q3 probably wouldn't see too many gains. Intel's Mobile and Communications Group (under its old reporting structure) reported an operating loss of more than $4.2 billion in 2014 , so cutting losses here is key to Intel's long-term earnings potential. Intel usually provides some form of forecast for its future period (2016) at its Investor Meeting in late November, so I'll be listening to hear if the company can further reduce mobile losses next year as it makes a sustained push into tablets and smartphones. Last week, a report stated that EU regulators had approved Intel's purchase of Altera (NASDAQ: ALTR ), and the deal is expected to close in the next quarter or two. There have been many skeptics of the deal, primarily due to the price Intel is paying. The key will be how quickly Intel is able to achieve cost synergies in the deal. Intel's operating expenses have been steadily rising in recent years, which have significantly hampered the company's bottom line. If Intel goes through another full year of major restructuring expenses, it will be hard for the company to significantly increase its earnings per share. The other half of this equation relates to Intel's share repurchase plan. As management detailed on the Q2 call, it expects to get back to zero net cash sometime during the second half of 2016. The company is taking on a significant amount of debt to finance the Altera deal. Management has stated that the buyback is the last real use of cash (after capex, the dividend, and acquisitions). Thus, I don't expect significant share repurchases in the next couple of quarters, and that could lead Intel's outstanding share count to start rising again. If that happens, earnings per share will be pressured. Remember, Intel already needs to achieve enough profitability from the Altera segment to offset the interest expenses it will be incurring to achieve the purchase. The final key to this puzzle will be capital spending. Originally, Intel guided for capex of $10 billion for 2015, but the company reduced that expectation down to $7.7 billion as of the Q2 report. Will we get another cut at the Q3 report? If so, free cash flow will benefit, and that could be key to a potential dividend raise in 2016. Once we get all of the Q3 numbers and some more clarity on next year's forecast, I'll examine the dividend angle in more detail. As seen in the chart below, Intel shares recently broke above their 200-day moving average for the first time in a couple of months. A strong earnings report could help the stock stay above this key technical level, which would provide support to the recent breakout. This could set up the bullish "golden cross" where the 50-day moving average eventually breaks above the 200-day. Expectations are a little low going into the report, with analysts calling for a 1.6% decline in Intel's 2015 revenues compared to management's most recent guidance for a 1% decrease. If the PC market isn't too weak and Intel is finally able to cut some of its mobile losses, the company should be set up for a strong 2016 with a return to EPS growth.
