Disney's Share Price Rise Is Becoming A Stretch - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Q2 earnings per share are up double digits. Disney's main earnings generator Media Networks was down for the quarter. The cable networks business saw a 9% drop in operating income. Entertainment giant Disney (NYSE: DIS ) released its Q2 2015 results this week, scoring solid revenue growth and a double-digit earnings per share increase. The stock had been building up to the earnings release, hitting a new record high of $113.30 on May 5. Perhaps, though, not everything is as good as it could be. Hard comparables from the year-ago period made this quarter's decent performance look as if business slipped for the successful Studio Entertainment segment that oversees film production. Last year, the movie hit Frozen was bringing in record revenues and earnings, skewing the figures upward. Segment revenue for Studio Entertainment was down 6%. However, with the big opening for the new Avenger's movie Age of Ultron, I would expect to see the segment's third quarter revenues up. The film has already set new records for biggest first weekend opening, and has grossed over $630 million since its overseas release in April. Later this year, several more movies will be released , including the much-awaited Star Wars VII expected to generate huge revenues as well. This quarter's comparables are just a case of unfortunate timing. My concern would be more with the Media Networks segment, which oversees cable networks and broadcasting. The segment was down 2%, due to cable networks dropping 9% in operating income. Broadcasting rose strongly, but its proportion of operating income is one-fifth of cable networks. Rising production and programming costs for its ESPN sports channel lowered earnings. Operating results for the Disney channels and ABC Family were flat compared to Q2 2015, which benefited from a settlement of an affiliate contract dispute. Source: Walt Disney Q2 fiscal 2015 earnings release The Cable Networks business is under pressure from direct-to-consumer content distributors wanting to separate Walt Disney's sports channels like ESPN from cable channel packages so that customers can mix and choose the cable channels they want. Recently Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ ) attempted to split them to offer "skinny bundles" to customers at cheaper prices. By contract, ESPN and the others are bundled with other channels, protecting recurring income streams. ESPN channel prices are very high in comparison with other popular channels. Disney has started a suit against Verizon to halt this, but it does illustrate the rising competition cable TV providers are having with online streaming content providers. In the Q2 earnings call, CEO Bob Iger was asked if Disney would consider starting its own direct-to-consumer service. He answered, "…the distributors, whether it's cable or satellite or even some of the new platforms, create real value for us, too. They already are in the customer acquisition business. They've already spent significant amount of money in capital to create their platforms. And they manage the relationship with the consumer, whether it's billing or technology or whatever fairly effectively… as long as the current distribution ecosystem or the one that seems to be emerging continues to create value for us, then we'll rely on it to distribute our product. When we believe that our opportunity to distribute directly is bigger than or better than the opportunity for others to distribute, then we'll go into that business more aggressively." Despite the wide array of movies hits Disney has lined up for release, challenges to the cable networks business could present a problem for the entertainment producer since its Media Networks segment accounts for 46% of total quarterly revenues and 60% of quarterly operating income. Even with the success of film revenues, Studio Entertainment segment operating income was less than a third of what Media Networks generated in the past six months. What's more is that Media Networks operating income was flat over the last two quarters. This segment's importance for Disney's earnings shouldn't be underestimated. Disney's stock is at all-time highs, more than tripling since late 2011. Can the momentum from film releases continue to drive the share price up higher? The stock gapped up to $100 in early February following the company's Q1 2015 earnings report. Now I expect its rise will become tenuous before the December 2015 release of the next Star Wars film. Disney's good growth story has been followed by so many investors that the share price could "take a breather" for a while. That's good, though. Currently, it's trading at 19 times forward earnings, which is becoming a bigger premium to pay considering fiscal 2016 earnings are forecast to be up just 12%. Once it settles down, investors will have a chance to buy at a more sedate, secure price. You don't need to chase this stock up at these levels.
