Intel buys Israeli 3D video tech firm Replay Technologies  | Reuters JERUSALEM Intel Corp (INTC.O) said on Wednesday it bought Israel's Replay Technologies, which developed a 3D video technology that has started to be used by U.S. professional sports broadcasters. In a blog on its website, Intel did not disclose the purchase price but Israeli media said it was about $175 million. Replay's technology was used in the recent National Basketball Association All-Star Weekend, mainly giving fans a 360 degree view of the slam dunk contest. Intel worked with Replay's technology to create a 3D video rendering of the court using 28 ultra high-definition cameras positioned around the arena and connected to Intel-based servers. It was also used in the National Football League's Super Bowl. "Intel has been collaborating with Replay since 2013 to optimize their interactive, immersive video content on Intel platforms," Intel said. "Technology now plays an unprecedented role in sports - and weâ€™re just getting started." Founded in 2011 Replay last month raised $13.5 million in funding round led by Deutsche Telekom Capital Partners (DTEGn.DE) to bring total fundraising to $27 million. Mark Cuban, owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, holds a stake in Replay. Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps tests two missiles that it said were designed to be able to hit Israel.  Slideshow   Thomson Reuters is the world's largest international multimedia news agency, providing investing news , world news , business news , technology news , headline news, small business news , news alerts, personal finance , stock market , and mutual funds information available on Reuters.com, video , mobile , and interactive television platforms.
