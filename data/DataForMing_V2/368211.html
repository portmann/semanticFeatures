Apple Is Grossly Mispriced (A Rebuttal) - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha This is a follow up article where I respond to feedback and constructive criticism I received from the Seeking Alpha community. I still believe Apple is a fantastic candidate for an overweight position. I provide a bonus chart to illustrate where Apple lies relative to the other S&P 500 constituents in terms of return and leverage. This article responds to the feedback I received to my overweight Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) thesis, Apple Is Grossly Mispriced . I begin by responding to what I consider to be key points in Bram de Haas's Apple: Be Careful article as succinctly as possible. After that I try my best to respond to feedback I received in the comments. In fact, revenue stagnating is one of the optimistic scenarios. The market is pricing in a drop in revenue and earnings. ... That mean estimate is down from the current diluted EPS of $9.40 now. This is not a worst case scenario, but the consensus scenario. I am not one for relying on consensus data, but let's look at it since it is being discussed. This is what Bloomberg consensus data shows for Apple. Yes, revenues are forecast to "decline" for FY 2016, if you consider -2.4% to be a "decline." I consider this -2.4% revenue "decline" to be revenue stagnation from a practical standpoint. If one considers this consensus "decline" relevant however you will also notice revenues are expected to grow 6.1% for the following year. Similarly EPS is forecast to fall slightly next year, but jump to $10.08 the following year. So again, a "decline" in EPS is not necessarily the end of the world. Most investors have a time horizon that extends beyond a year. 2) Free cash flow is expected to fall. Free cash flow will fall faster than revenue ... The market is correctly anticipating free cash flow falling. I have also included free cash flow figures in the image above to address this point. Yes, free cash flow figures are expected to dip and stabilize at around the $58 - $60bn mark for this year and the next. In other words Apple is only forecast to generate a 9.2% free cash flow yield for the next two years, while the rest of the market currently sits at 5.5%. Again I fail to see how this is terrible for investors. Even if the underlying financials of a company do flat-line it can still be a great investment if the price you pay is right. Like I said in my previous article investors would be hard-pressed to find an alternative investment as attractively priced as Apple. Consider Blackberry's (NASDAQ: BBRY ) profit margins between 2005 and 2011. A long stretch of very strong margins. Currently, gross profit is still very good, but net profit isn't ... Today's winner can be tomorrow's loser. There are a couple of things wrong with this comparison. First the strength and stability of Apple and BlackBerry's margins are not even comparable. This is what they look like with the exact same scale for side-by-side comparison. Note that I had to cut these charts off at -40% for aesthetic purposes due to the drastic volatility of BlackBerry's net profit margins. As you can clearly see above BlackBerry's margins have always been volatile. I am unable to point out the "long stretch of very strong and stable" margins de Haas mentioned. Apple on the other hand has shown stable and consistent margin growth beginning 2001 and has shown no signs of slowing down ever since. Second and most importantly, Apple has developed a sophisticated ecosystem compared to BlackBerry's non-existent ecosystem. The convenience the integration of multiple products delivers to consumers not only makes it harder for them to leave, but it creates multiple cross-platform revenue generating opportunities. I will now respond to some of the comments from the readership here. I apologize if I did not select your comment. 4) The S&P 500 could be grossly overvalued instead of Apple being grossly undervalued. I do not dispute this. All I am disputing is the disparity between the two. Since writing the original article this disparity has only narrowed from 38% to 37% so there is still plenty of potential outperformance for investors if parity were to occur. To outperform the market you do not necessarily have to pick stocks that appreciate in value. Being overweight stocks that fall less than the market is another path to outperformance. As previously mentioned I consider Apple to be an ecosystem rather than a hardware company or a software company. If Apple were truly a hardware company it would be easy for competitors to crush; all they would have to do is produce products with better specifications or produce the same product at a cheaper price. However this has not transpired. Superior specifications do not necessarily translate into greater customer satisfaction. 6) Apple doesn't know what to do with its cash so it deserves a low P/E. I think Apple has plenty of ideas what to do with their cash, but they have been constrained due to the tax inefficiency of repatriating cash from abroad. This is certainly one of the largest negatives to Apple I can think of, however it could also result in one of the largest potential share price catalysts at some point in the future. Imagine for a moment what would happen to Apple's share price if it were to negotiate a more tax effective cash repatriation strategy with the U.S. Government. I would not invest in Apple on such a speculative basis, but it is worth keeping this possibility in mind. I have put this together as a rough guide so investors can appreciate where other individual stocks rank compared to Apple. The basic gist of this scatter chart is this: the further to the right the stock is along the X axis, the stronger its balance sheet as net cash makes up a larger percentage of the company's market capitalization. Negative numbers indicate a net debt position. The higher up the stock is along the Y axis the greater the free cash flow yield of the stock. Essentially this is a matter of return vs leverage. It is easy to find stocks with a low P/E, but you will usually find they have a lot of debt relative to their market capitalization. Conversely stocks with strong net cash positions can attract a P/E premium as they still have the ability to use their cash position and debt facilities to create growth. As you can see Apple is to the right and above the vast majority of constituents on this chart - a combination of both larger returns and less leverage than the rest. Again there are not many alternative investments as attractive as Apple considering its current P/E relative to the S&P 500. I am still overweight Apple with the view that it outperforms the market over the next 12 to 24 months. I don't see any realistic threat to Apple's ecosystem going forward. I think the risks are overblown and the current 37% P/E discount to the S&P 500 remains unwarranted. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.
