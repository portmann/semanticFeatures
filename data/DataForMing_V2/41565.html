Amazon Launches New Marketplace To Sell Specialized Supplies To Businesses â€“ Consumerist Amazon is gunning for businesses â€“ connecting them with sellers of everything from lab equipment to food service supplies. The online retail giant launched its latest marketplace Tuesday, aiming to provide businesses with the same shopping service the company offers everyday customers. Amazon said today that the new Amazon Business marketplace will connect individual businesses to third-party sellers of specialized office supplies, healthcare products, industrial equipment, IT equipment, and other unique business-only products. Businesses that sign up for the new marketplace can assign multiple users to the accounts with purchase and approval controls set to the company’s own procurement systems, Prentis Wilson, vice president of Amazon Business, says in a statement. Amazon says membership to the marketplace will come with several benefits including exclusive pricing and bulk discounts. Other features Amazon Business members receive include free two-day shipping for orders over $49, tax exemption and the option of an Amazon Corporate Credit Line. â€œAmazon Business delivers a new and expanded marketplace that brings the selection, convenience and value of Amazon to business customers, manufacturers and sellers with the additional selection, features and back-end integration businesses need to save time and money,â€?
