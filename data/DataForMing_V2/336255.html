Don't Count Ford Motor Out Just Yet - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford Motor released excellent U.S. sales numbers for February yesterday. Ford's February sales were up 20.4% Y/Y, handsomely beating the consensus estimate. Just a couple of days ago I penned a piece on Ford Motor (NYSE: F ), saying that the automaker is a solid income play despite concerns over a cyclical downturn that has gotten the best of investors lately. While I think that Ford Motor is indeed priced for a recession , I am also under the impression that investors have become too fearful of auto makers, and that could be a big mistake. Yesterday's surge in Ford Motor's shares proves just that. Ford Motor said yesterday that its U.S. sales in February surged 20.4 (!) Y/Y to 217,192 vehicles. In February 2015 Ford Motor sold 180,383 vehicles, a big difference. Surging vehicle sales in February, traditionally not a great month for auto makers, implies one thing, first and foremost: Ford Motor continues to enjoy strong vehicle sales in 2016, and investors betting on a cyclical downturn may have placed their bests just a little too early. Ford Motor's February sales announcement was very positively received by investors; the stock climbed 4.64% higher on Tuesday. Ford is still down ~7% YTD after a terrible start to the year for stocks, but better-than-expected sales numbers for the month of February have reignited interest in Ford's stock. Ford Motor indeed saw very robust sales growth in February: Car sales increased 18.8% Y/Y with 66,613 vehicles being sold, utility sales gained 29.2% with 70,328 vehicles being sold, and truck sales were up 14.8% to 80,251 units. Ford's retail sales surged 11% Y/Y, and made February 2016 the best sales month for the auto company in eleven years. What's not to like here? Tuesdays' sales update had an important lesson in store for investors betting that Ford Motor's sales are going to fall off a cliff soon: The automaker is always good for a surprise, and shouldn't be counted out just yet. Ford Motor's stock has suffered in 2016 for a couple of reasons. One, investors rebalanced their portfolios in light of the market slide and sold cyclical companies including auto makers. Two, analysts reduced their price targets on the stock, many of whom raised concerns over the maturity of the market cycle. In other words: Investors speculated that Ford's auto sales would fall off a cliff sooner rather than later, and that an economic slowdown would hurt the company and its shareholders. But not so fast. Ford's excellent February sales and significant beat of the consensus sales growth estimate of 17.1% prove one point more than any other: Investors speculating on a downturn may have arrived to the party way too early. Now is not the time to bet against Ford Motor. SUVs and trucks continue to drive Ford Motor's sales in the United States. Automakers had a strong sales month in February, which strengthens the notion that Ford's stock can appreciate further on the back of continued sales growth in the months ahead. I still think that Ford Motor is, first and foremost, an income vehicle, but Ford's common stock is certainly always good for a pop when it's time to release monthly sales.
