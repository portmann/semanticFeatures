Facebook: Removing Bottom Funnel Friction Will Further Drive Marketing, Advertising Efforts - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha As first reported by techcrunch, Facebook is altering the way that advertisers collect information from users. Facebook now will pre-fill user information it has collected for its platform (name, address, email, phone number, etc.) into an ad/call to action/landing page box for the user if opted-in. In the immediate term this will remove friction from users actually completing the process of giving information to an advertiser. The second share price driving reason this subtle change is important is that it could be used, eventually, to drive one-click, opt-in allowance enrollment in recurring content. As first reported by T echcrunch , Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) is altering the way that advertisers collect information from users. This update is one of the rare occasions where the change actually benefits both engaged parties - something that will make the third-party involved, Facebook, very happy. So the change is subtle and most users who find themselves interested in an advertisement or if they've never clicked an ad most likely won't notice the difference - this is an intended outcome of the change, but the change is meaningful. Facebook now will pre-fill user information it has collected for its platform (name, address, email, phone number, etc.), if the user selects this option, into an ad/call to action/landing page box for the user. Why does this matter? Two share price driving reasons that I can call out in the early going. The first is the obvious one in that in the immediate term this will remove friction from users actually completing the process of giving information to an advertiser. That's big for obvious reasons as well. Lower abandon rates, increased efficacy rates, better key metrics for both the advertiser and Facebook, better data collection for Facebook - stuff like what types of ads are you and I most attracted to, etc. I mean everything that you would expect. These are all things, by the way, that Facebook again can sell to follow-on advertising partners and marketers for a premium. What you're seeing Facebook do, inch by inch, is widen the top of the sales funnel and streamline everything below the opening lip. As for the second reason this is big, coincidentally a conversation I had this morning happens to frame it quite nicely. I was chatting with Playbasis , a gamification specialist tech company founder and CEO Rob Zepeda this morning and he was adamant in his belief that, "The smart companies are going to be investing heavily in improving outcomes - the bottom of the funnel. It's more important than the top of the funnel. The leverage is in improving conversion and increasing consumption." I couldn't agree more with that assessment and I think very obviously Facebook understands this. I believe the second share price driving reason this subtle change is important is that it could be used, eventually, to drive one-click, opt-in allowance enrollment in recurring content. I'll explain. So, I've opined many a time recently and tried to keep readers abreast of changes either productive or detractive to my thesis that Facebook is optimizing its core platform for content marketing, specifically the Inbound variety. If I'm right, this "easy opt-in" that Facebook is testing and priming its user base for could and should be deployed to Instant Articles as well as other content containing Author Tags. If Facebook can show traction early with this first initiative and subsequently show traction in launching this to broader content it would have serious ground to stand on in asking content generators to pay a huge premium for it helping build a following base. I believe both Facebook's Instant Articles and Author Tags are parallel value prop drivers that will be platforms to drive value from its auto opt-in initiative. Facebook being a proactive contributor to a paying advertiser or marketer' user/lead base would be a unique, verifiable asset it could sell similar to the value-prop that Inbound Marketing companies HubSpot (NYSE: HUBS ) and Marketo (NASDAQ: MKTO ) sell to their customers. A value prop that collectively, in the infancy of the industry, has already created $4 billion in market cap - this is without having a source platform to pluck leads from or any real infrastructure housing for a lead base. That's just two companies in the much wider, much deeper niche. Again, I continue to believe that Facebook sees the forest through the trees when it comes to the tectonic shift in marketing and advertising, as do the companies mentioned above, and that it's taking the adequate steps to insure that it's a major player when the movement settles. I continue to recommend FB as a core position. FB common is up 17.6% since I initiated a long position with the Facebook Jan 20, 2017 $87.50 CALL's up 44% since initiation five trading days ago.
