Facebook: Great Company But A Tricky Valuation - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Share-based compensation can lead to bad capital allocation decisions. The impacts of share-based compensation can be difficult to measure. Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) is a great company but understanding its valuation can be difficult. The company has a relatively high level of share-based compensation and this creates uncertainty. It i's wonderful the way the company is growing revenue but it's hard to know how much current owners will benefit from this growth as costs like share-based compensation continue to rise. I view share based compensation as a real expense and it confuses me when companies like Facebook and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) use non-GAAP numbers that exclude it. Leon Cooperman said that he once asked Andy Grove what statement Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) was making when buying back stock at 50 times earnings. Here is his recollection of Andy Grove's answer: We're not looking to make any statement, we just don't want the crap from the shareholders over dilution so we're buying back sufficient shares to keep the share count flat. ( NYSSA - A Case Study in Financial Brilliance: Dr. Henry E. Singleton of Teledyne Inc. 43:05 to 43:43) A hidden cost of share-based compensation is that it can lead to bad capital allocation decisions. One way to think about the cost of share-based compensation is to look at what a company has to spend buying back shares in order to keep dilution flat. It can cause companies to buy back stock based on dilution concerns without regard as to whether the shares are undervalued or overvalued. This is capital that could otherwise be allocated to things like dividends and acquisitions. Facebook is not yet buying back shares to control dilution but the company will have to face the dilution impact sooner or later. Looking at some numbers helps to put things in perspective. Again, Facebook is outside of my circle of competence because the impact of their high stock based compensation is hard to quantify. By contrast, I own Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and I'm comfortable with their relatively small stock based compensation numbers. Google's stock-based compensation is higher than I would like to see but I own them as well. Facebook has a high percentage of share-based compensation to revenue (19.2%, 14.4%, 11.6%, and 30.8% for first half 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively). Looking at the percentage against revenue alone can be like comparing apples to oranges since some companies have better margins than others. As such, it's good to look at things like net income as well. Facebook, Google and Apple all have excellent margins so comparisons against revenue have merit. Google has a lower percentage of share-based compensation to revenue (6.7%, 6.5%, 6%, and 5.8% for first half 2015, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively): Diluted Shares: 665 million from 10-K (Morningstar shows 645) Apple has an even lower percentage of share based compensation to revenue (1.5%, 1.6%, 1.3%, and 1.1% for nine months 2015, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively): We see that Apple's share count is going down. The company doesn't have much dilution from stock-based compensation and it has been buying back shares aggressively since 2013. The latest 10-Qs for Facebook, Google and Apple show unrecognized share-based compensation amounts of $8.2 billion, $8.2 billion and $7.3 billion, respectively. *Note that the fiscal year for Facebook and Google ends on December 31st but it ends on September 27th for Apple. The share based compensation expense has been included in the GAAP net income numbers above but Facebook and Google also use non-GAAP numbers that leave it out. Apple is the only one of the three that sticks to GAAP earnings. The Barron's How Much Do Silicon Valley Firms Really Earn article by Andrew Bary gives me concerns about Google: Google is a prime example, with a projected stock-comp expense of $4.4 billion this year, or an average of about $80,000 for each of Google's 55,000 employees. Google's stock comp has doubled since 2011. Google anticipates an increase to $5.9 billion in 2016. Again, their stock based compensation is higher than I would like but it's still significantly lower than Facebook's. John Bogle has pointed out that high stock based compensation can encourage manipulation: It (stock based compensation) encourages chief executives - and their chief financial officers, too often with the tacit approval of their public accountants and their directors - to manipulate the expectations market to their own benefit. (Don't Count on It by John Bogle page 93) The dilution issue is plenty to worry about. It's beyond the scope of this article to analyze the threat of manipulation. Still, Bogle is a highly respected authority and his words carry weight. We don't need to understand all the nuances behind share-based compensation in order to realize that it creates dilution problems. It isn't that Apple and Google are comparable to Facebook. It isn't that they are better investments either. It's more a matter of stepping back and reflecting on why I'm comfortable owning some technology companies like Apple and Google but not other companies with higher levels of share-based compensation like Facebook. It's possible that Facebook will be a great investment over the next 5 or 10 years. However, I don't have to swing at every pitch. Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL, GOOG, GOOGL.
