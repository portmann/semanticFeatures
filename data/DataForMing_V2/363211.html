Amazon may break Indiaâ€™s new foreign e-commerce rules, says NYT - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Apr  8 2016, 07:54 ET | By: Brian Pacampara, CFA , SA News Editor Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and several rivals in India seem to violate new regulations related to pricing and the sourcing of sales, reports NY Times. According to analysts, the new regulations appear to make Amazon’s reliance on one large seller on its site, Cloudtail, illegal. Amazon has more than 80K sellers on its India site, but Cloudtail is estimated to represent 40%-50% of sales. A trade group representing the e-commerce companies is considering sending a letter asking the Indian government for clarification or to delay enforcement until September.
