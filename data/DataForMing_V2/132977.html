Amazon Dash Buttons Are Finally Available To Everyone â€“ Consumerist Whoops! It looks like portions of our site are being blocked! Check your browser settings or contact your network administrator. Amazon just happened to announce their new ordering gadget, Dash buttons, on March 31, which earned them a lot of free publicity as people chattered about whether it was an April Fool’s Day prank or not. It had to be a joke, right? It was not. It was a real product that Amazon promised to make available in a few weeks. Now it’s sixteen weeks later, and there are eighteen different Dash buttons that you can order. There’s this essential one, of course: Other big-brand offerings include Gatorade, Clorox wipes, Maxwell House coffee, Tide detergent, Huggies diapers, Gerber baby formula, and Gillette razors. Amazon also offers a button for its own brand of baby wipes, and there’s a button for Wellness brand pet foods. You use your smartphone to connect the button to the specific product that it orders: the Wellness button, for example, can be associated with 14 different products from the company’s pet food brands, including kibble or canned food for dogs or for cats. The buttons were available by invitation for free as part of a test phase, and now any Prime member can purchase them. If that’s what you want to do.
