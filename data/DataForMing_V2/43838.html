InvenSense Guidance For Fiscal Year 2016 Means Everything - InvenSense (NYSE:INVN) | Seeking Alpha I am cautiously optimistic that InvenSense will guide above the Street estimates for FY2016; however, in order to do so, INVN needs to be inside the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6. I'm slashing my 12-month price target from $31 to $24 (25x FY2016 EPS est. of $0.92), which still represents a 50% premium over current prices. I believe InvenSense management will guide FY2016 revenue growth between 25% and 35%, which would put 2016 revenue levels between $445m and $500m and meaningfully above Street estimates. In the event that InvenSense does not maintain its position in Apple's flagship iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S, my price target will be reduced from $24 to $15. InvenSense (NYSE: INVN ) guidance for FY 2016 means everything. The company will report earnings on May 4th and the short-term direction of the price is on the line. I am cautiously optimistic that InvenSense will guide above the street estimates for FY2016, however in order to do so INVN needs to be inside the iPhone 6S coming out this fall and maintain its design win on the iPhone 6. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has already decided to go with rival STMicroelectronics (NYSE: STM ) for the Apple Watch and there is no telling if InvenSense will keep its market position inside Apple's 6S flagship iPhone this fall. InvenSense is a momentum stock. I recommend pairing back your position from 3-7% of your portfolio to 3-5% unless you can stomach additional potential losses in share prices to as low as $10 per share. I'm slashing my 12-month price target from $31 to $24 (25x FY2016 EPS est. of $0.92), which still represents a 50% premium over current prices. InvenSense is full of potential long-term, but the immediate path forward for shareholders is highly dependent on InvenSense's ability to maintain its design win on the iPhone 6S coming out this fall. Chipworks reported late Friday that InvenSense was not inside the Apple Watch. Instead Apple went with rival STMicroelectronics. This is an obvious hit to InvenSense's wearable market share and will take its share from near 90% to single digits in FY 2016. On the positive side gross margins should improve slightly based on customer mix since Apple was a lower gross margin customer vs. Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) and others. In the event that InvenSense does not maintain its position in Apple's flagship iPhone 6S my price target will be reduced from $24 to $15 and we will likely see shares of InvenSense fall as low as $10 per share following the conference call on May 4th. INVN will report its Q4 FY2015 results on May 4th and its FY2016 guidance means everything. The company will be setting revenue guidance for FY2016. The Street is expecting a 19% increase in FY2016 revenue to $442m from $370m in 2015. A full-year of strong iPhone 6/iPhone 6 Plus sales vs. a partial year of sales in 2015 should drive top line growth. InvenSense guided FY2015 revenue growth between 25% and 35%, however management is on target to deliver above guidance growth of 47% Y-o-Y. At this point, I believe InvenSense management will guide FY2016 revenue growth between 25% and 35%, which would put 2016 revenue levels between $445m and $500m and meaningfully above street estimates. In FY2016, I'm now modeling revenue of $500m, an increase of 35% YoY, but still down from $560m modeled in January 2015 and $600m I expected as of October 2014. The $130m increase over 2015 is split almost 60/40 between Apple ($81m) and growth opportunities in core/adjacent markets ($49m). Samsung's focus on reducing SKUs also should improve sales of its flagship phones containing INVN sensors as Samsung refocuses on the company's premium smartphone battle with Apple. Additionally there have been some reports that InvenSense has gained back smartphone market share that it lost with Chinese handset maker Xiaomi. Both of these developments would support higher gross margins and sales in FY 2016. My FY16 revenue estimate for Apple totals $204m, which is based on 194m iPhones shipped with InvenSense chips at an average ASP of $1.05, up from $123m for FY15 off of 135m handsets sold at an average ASP of $0.91. I'm no longer modeling revenue contributions from the Apple Watch. Right now I see a few scenarios playing out for Apple and Invensense as we head into the fall and Apple introduces the iPhone 6S. The bullish scenario is that InvenSense maintains its placement within the iPhone 6 and won the bid to appear in the iPhone 6s. My revenue estimate for FY2016 currently assumes InvenSense won the iPhone 6S design. If InvenSense failed to win the iPhone 6s design I'm estimating that Apple will ship 135m iPhones containing InvenSense chips in FY 2016, which represents a 0% unit growth year-over-year. My revenue estimate would fall from $204m for Apple down to $117m, which assumes a $6m decline in Y-o-Y revenue due to a lower ASP in FY2016 versus FY2015. This in turn would take down my FY2016 revenue estimate from $500m to $423m and lower my FY2016 EPS estimate from $0.95 to $0.62 and drop my price target from $24 to $15. In calendar Q1 2015, iPhone 6 sales are expected to make up about 70% of Apple's iPhone sales while older models (5S/5C/4S) account for the remaining 30%. What this means is InvenSense only receives revenue for 70% of the phones sold by Apple. In addition, InvenSense's ASP on the iPhone 6 is less than the iPhone 6 Plus, which means that nearly 75% of the phones sold by Apple that include InvenSense products are being sold at a lower ASP attached to the iPhone 6 model. Looking ahead to the iPhone 6S it is expected that both models will feature an OIS (optical image stabilizer), which should drive up the ASP for InvenSense in FY 2016 over FY 2015. Apple also will likely phase out sales of the iPhone 5S and 5C, which still account for nearly 26% of phones sold today. In theory by calendar Q4 2015 96% of iPhones sold could include InvenSense chips if the company can maintain its position within Apple's flagship phones. In terms of margins I expect management to guide non-GAAP gross margins between 47% and 49%, a slight improvement over the 2H of 2015. InvenSense gross margins are dependent on improving its manufacturing yield as well as its customer and product mix. My current model assumes an average gross margin of 48% in FY 2016.
