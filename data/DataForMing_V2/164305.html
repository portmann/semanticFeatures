Verizon: Investment Thesis Enhanced - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha Stone Fox Capital , Stone Fox Capital (1,507 clicks) Despite a compelling valuation previously highlighted as the best in years the stock dropped to new multi-year lows. Unfortunately the rhetoric regarding the domestic pricing wars are ongoing, but the damage appears easily contained. The investment thesis isn't altered at this point with the volatile market providing a better entry point at an even higher dividend yield. One of the most disappointing calls of the last few months was that Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ ) was set to rally. Having survived the domestic wireless pricing war, the company appeared poised to rally to new heights. The stock was deemed the " Best Value In Years ", but Verizon hasn't gained in the last couple of months. In fact, the stock actually hit multi-year lows if one counts the flash-crash type trading that took place on August 24. In reality, the stock has outperformed the market during that period with the S&P 500 index down a whopping 8.2%, nearly double the 4.3% loss of Verizon. This situation provides a prime example of where a correct thesis might provide a solid relative return, but the brokerage account doesn't look so good with negative real returns. When looking at the below three-year chart, one sees a stock trapped in a trading range. Any reason investors should abandon the original thesis now that the breakout hasn't occurred? While a lot of positives exist including an extremely appealing valuation that hasn't existed in years, the pricing wars aren't ending anytime soon. Sprint (NYSE: S ) continues to agitate with more pricing gimmicks and possibly the most damaging is the new attention from the T-Mobile (NYSE: TMUS ) CEO. CEO John Legere typically saves his attacks for Sprint and their CEO, but in the last few days he has become increasingly aggressive with Verizon. His latest attack on Verizon is via social media including the below from his Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) account. At this point, it isn't something that is going to concern Verizon, but a protracted attack could damage the brand. Verizon would much prefer that Mr. Legere spend his time slamming on Sprint. While the rhetoric regarding pricing wars hasn't disappeared, the reality is that EPS estimates continue to rise. The investment thesis that the stock would head higher was based in part on the fact that Verizon came through the big thrust of the pricing war mostly unscathed. As the below chart shows, EPS estimates dipped towards the end of last year, but the numbers are now rebounding solidly. It is unusual to see EPS estimates rise while the stock declines. Remember that Verizon now only trades at roughly 11x EPS estimates with the stock trading around $46. With the first chart highlighting how Verizon has traded in a tight range for going on three years, it sure is nice that the stock pays a nearly 5% dividend yield. The news is good in this area with Verizon declaring a 2.7% increase to the quarterly dividend. The company will now pay a quarterly dividend of $0.565. The new dividend is probably the best of both worlds. Verizon has a rather large debt load from purchasing all of Verizon Wireless and the dividend is already a lofty 4.9%. Investors may want a larger yield, but the company needs to reduce the net debt load that sits at $109 billion. Fellow contributor Bob Ciura highlights why Verizon can afford the dividend increase. He even suggests the company could pay even more based on free cash flow. While definitely agreeing, the preference is that the company reduce debt levels to provide financial flexibility in the future. Maybe the only scenario that leads Verizon into financial trouble in the future is a large debt load. While the amount is very manageable now, it is always wise to remain cautious when it comes to owing somebody else money. While relative performance isn't good enough when the outcome is negative, the ability to better withstand the recent market sell off highlights the value proposition of the stock. With a domestic focus, Verizon is ideally insulated from China and emerging market weakness and provides a very solid 4.9% dividend yield. At this point, the domestic pricing wars aren't much more then a headache. Verizon has already shown the ability to navigate the difficult market and grow earnings. The recent weakness in the stock only increases the compelling valuation proposition.
