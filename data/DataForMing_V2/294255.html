Ask the Readers: What's the Worst Job You've Ever Had? You've likely worked a variety of jobs, and some jobs may not be what you're interested in. That doesn't tend to be a huge issue (there are bills to pay, after all!) — unless there's something about the job that makes it really wrong for you. Personality clashes with the boss, mind-numbingly boring tasks, awful hours...these are just a few things that can really make you hate your job. What's the worst job you've ever had? What made it so terrible? If it was a previous job, how did you get out of the situation? If it is a current job, what do you plan to do to improve the situation? Tell us about the worst job you have ever had and we'll enter you in a drawing to win a $20 Amazon Gift Card! Post your answer in the comments below.
