High Opportunity Cost Of Owning Facebook Stock - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Lower profits than an equally-sized alternative investment. Higher forward P/E ratio than technology peers. Facebook's (NASDAQ: FB ) advertising revenue and user engagement have grown tremendously over the past two years and the company continues to prosper in mobile and video. While the stock has easily outperformed the S&P 500 in 2015, better investment options may exist. Superior profits from an equally-sized alternative investment, a higher forward P/E ratio than technology peers and lack of service offering in a fast growing business lead to a high opportunity cost when owning shares in Facebook. Facebook today has a market capitalization of $300 Billion. An investor buying shares can either purchase a portion of Facebook or a portion of a conglomerate with an equal market capitalization. An investor buying shares in Facebook will partly own a company with the best social network, a top photo sharing tool (Instagram) and a top communication tool (WhatsApp). An investor buying shares in an equally-sized conglomerate will partly own the world's largest money manager (BlackRock (NYSE: BLK )), the largest grocer in the US (Kroger (NYSE: KR )), the largest club retailer (Costco (NASDAQ: COST )), a mobile payments player (PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL )), a consumer goods giant (Colgate (NYSE: CL )), etc. An investor can either purchase a portion of Facebook, which earned $2.82 billion in net income the past four quarters, or a portion of an equally sized consortium of top companies that earned $14.70 Billion in net income the past four quarters. Buying shares in Facebook has the opportunity cost of not owning shares in an equivalent conglomerate that generates vastly more profit. Investors that are bullish on Facebook often refer to the company's forward price to earnings ratio of 37 to justify the stock's current high multiple. An investor buying shares in Facebook today is not buying shares in other technology companies that have significantly lower forward P/E ratios. These investors are paying more money for future earnings by buying Facebook than they would by buying shares in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) or Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ). Alphabet, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Microsoft, and IBM (NYSE: IBM ) have all reported strong gains in their cloud computing services. Amazon Web Services has already earned over $1 billion in net income in 2015, Azure is on pace to generate $8.2 billion in revenue this year and IBM reported that it's cloud services brought in $9.4 billion over the past 12 months. Cloud computing is a immensely fast growing business and Facebook has no service offering. Facebook has the technological know how and scale to start a cloud computing business. While Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft and IBM focus on enterprise customers, Facebook can launch a cloud service for individuals. The company's expertise in creating easy to use applications can be utilized to launch a consumer focused cloud. DropBox has already proven a market exists. By not offering a cloud service, Facebook is missing out on a fast growing business. This is not meant to say Facebook is a bad to stock to own. Rather, this is meant to show better investment options may exist. Significantly lower profits than an equally-sized alternative investment, a higher forward price to earnings ratio than technology peers and lack of cloud service offering leads to a high opportunity cost for investors owning shares in Facebook. The arguments above are primarily based on profits and do not account for investor preference. Facebook is undoubtedly a hot stock and the high multiple is due to investors believing the company will continue to prosper. The company has proven it can win in mobile and video; two areas that will continue to grow well into the future. The lack of a cloud service may be a benefit to the company. Offering such a service would likely lead to a price war with Google and Box (NYSE: BOX ). A cloud service may not help the company's goal of connecting the world's population.
