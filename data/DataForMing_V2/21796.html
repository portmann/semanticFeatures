Boeing: 5% Performance Shortfall Puts 737 MAX In A Difficult Position (Part 2) - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Boeing uses per seat figures because it has a significantly higher capacity. Total block fuel burn differs by 2% maximum. In part 1 of this article I had a look at the impact the 5% shortfall of the CMF LEAP-1B engines have on the fuel burn figures for the Boeing (NYSE: BA ) 737 MAX 8 and concluded that the shortfall put Boeing in a very difficult position. Not only because a shortfall might cost the manufacturer money, but also because it will narrow a possible gap with the Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSF ) ( OTCPK:EADSY ) A320neo (in Airbus' advantage). In this article I look at the shortfall on the Airbus A320neo and see how it compares to the Airbus A320ceo as well as the Boeing 737 MAX 8. Whereas the Boeing 737 MAX engines are coping with a 5% shortfall, the Airbus A320neo engines are coping with a shortfall of 2%. Figure 2: Impact Airbus A320 on efficiencies compared to the Airbus A320 (Source: Dhierin-Perkash Bechai) The Airbus A320neo features a higher weight (due to the heavier engines) and has increased aerodynamic and propulsive efficiency and should be able to carry 3 passengers more. For a 1000 nautical mile mission the Airbus A320neo has 9% lower fuel consumption, on per seat basis this translates to 11% lower fuel costs compared to the Airbus A320ceo. When taking into account the 2% shortfall the advantage on a 1000 nautical mile mission shrinks to 8% for the trip fuel and 10% for the fuel costs per seat. Airbus claimed 15% lower fuel cost, my model indeed goes towards an advantage of 15% on longer trips. Figure 3: Impact on fuel efficiency (including shortfall) compared to the Airbus A320 over a wider range (Source: Dhierin-Perkash Bechai) The figure shows that the impact is not as severe as it is with the Boeing 737 MAX 8, which has a bigger shortfall. It can be concluded that both manufacturers, Boeing and Airbus, seem to be claiming very rosy figures for their aircraft. Again, looking at the claims made by Boeing and comparing those to my model: The Boeing 737 MAX 8 will be 17% more fuel efficient per seat compared to the A320 My model shows a 14.7% advantage without performance shortfall, with performance shortfall the advantage decreases to 12.8%. The Boeing 737 MAX 8 will be 12% more fuel efficient per seat compared to the Boeing 737-800 My model shows an 8.6% advantage without performance shortfall, with performance shortfall the advantage decreases to 6.5%. So the results are not very accurate and sketch a picture that is too rosy. The Airbus A320neo will be 12% more fuel efficient per seat compared to the Airbus A320 The Boeing 737 MAX8 will be 6% more fuel efficient per seat compared to the Airbus A320neo. There are some slides where Boeing claims an 8% advantage as well. My model shows a 7.1% advantage without performance shortfall, with performance shortfall for both airframes the advantage shrinks to 5.9%. Figure 4: Impact on fuel efficiency (including shortfall) over a wider range (Source: Dhierin-Perkash Bechai) The figure quite clearly shows that with the shortfall the gap between the Airbus A320neo and the Boeing 737 MAX 8 narrows quite a bit. With the Airbus A320neo and ceo already selling better than the 737NG and the 737 MAX Boeing finds itself in a very difficult spot. The 2% shortfall for the Airbus A320neo should be compensated for quite easily with an improvement package. Additionally the A320neo can be powered by Pratt and Whitney turbofans. So if the shortfall persists customers can choose to use the P&W engines instead of the CFM engines. The Pratt and Whitney engines should be running slightly better than specified. Having 2 engine suppliers for an airframe can spark a competition that leads to higher efficiencies. The Boeing 737 MAX has 1 engine supplier, so it does not have the advantage of competing engine suppliers. Figure 5: Impact on fuel efficiency (including shortfall) over a wider range (Source: Dhierin-Perkash Bechai) One of the things that does not bode well for Boeing either is that Airbus is upping their seat counts as well. The Space-Flex cabin allows up to 3 additional revenue generating seats. Boeing claims that 160 seats is what the market wants, if Airbus squeezes in an extra row of seats it has 159 seats, with a minimal decrease in comfort. This narrows the advantage for the 737 MAX to 3%-4.5%. Now what has to be noted is the reason why Boeing is using the per seat figures. The reason is because the Boeing 737 has a significantly higher seat count which yields high percentage advantage when looking at the per seat figures. When looking at total block fuel burn the difference is less than a percent for short flights and grows to a little less than 2% on longer flights. The shortfall will limit the range of the Boeing 737 MAX, which will be problematic since the Boeing 737 MAX already has a lower range capability compared to the Airbus A320neo. The lower range eventually can lower the accessible market for Boeing. The Airbus A320, having a wider cabin, has much more to offer in terms of passenger comfort. Additionally the Airbus A320 can be loaded with LD containers, which allows for quicker loading. The Boeing 737 MAX is one last squeeze out of the 737 concept, but it is not going to win market share from Airbus: The base of the 737 design are just too old to effectively compete with the Airbus A320, which is a design from the 1980s while the Boeing 737 is designed in the 1970s and based on the Boeing 707 that was designed a decade before that.
