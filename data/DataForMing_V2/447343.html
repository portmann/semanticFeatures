Apple Stock: Still Too Risky - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha As per our 2014 article, selling Apple stock when it was trading at over $118 was the right thing to do. Apple's share buybacks have been ineffective and have slowed Apple's cash growth. On November 25, 2014, we recommended booking profits and selling Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) shares in our article: Apple: $800 done, $1,000 pre-split next? The prices mentioned in the title referenced Apple's stock price prior to its 7:1 split, in a continuation of a series of previously bullish articles we had published on Apple since 2011. Since our bearish article of 2014, Apple shares have dropped from $118.63 ($115.31 adjusted for dividends) on 11/24/2014 to $94.40 on 6/29/2016, a drop of 20.4% (18.1% adjusted for dividends). That was the first time ever that we had turned bearish on Apple shares. Despite the sizable realized drop in Apple's stock price, we believe that downside risks persist and Apple shares are still too risky. The headlines about Apple's cash are often misleading and Apple's "cash" may not overcome upcoming headwinds during next several months. Many headlines pointing to Apple's massive cash hoard of over $233 billion are somewhat misleading. Although it is true that at end of Q1 2016 Apple had over $233 billion in cash, short & long term investments, when excluding Apple's short and long term debt of about $80 billion, this number drops from $233 billion to $153 billion. Furthermore, if we exclude the difference between accounts payable and accounts receivable, amounting to about $28.5 billion, then this number drops further to about $124.5 billion. It is interesting to note that this refined number is not much different from Q3 2013, where it stood at $120.5 billion. Furthermore, current stockholder equity for Apple stands at about $130.5 billion, only about 6% higher than its Q3 2013 level of $123.5 billion. There is no question that these refined amounts are still quite sizable and respectable. The minimal growth in these amounts from 2013 has been primarily a result of Apple's payment of dividends, as well as its share buyback program. However, Apple's share buyback program has proven to be quite expensive so far. As illustrated by Shawn Tully of Fortune magazine , between Q3 2013 and Q4 2015, Apple paid an average of $115 for each share it retired, substantially higher than current trading level of $94.40. Tully estimates that Apple had paid $15 billion more than it had to. Some would argue that Apple shares would be lower today had Apple not engaged in its share buyback program. We would argue that this statement is not necessarily true. If Apple had not engaged in share buybacks, its refined cash holdings number would be substantially higher. In addition, it would have additional investment return on this money (while it would have also saved interest payments on accumulated debt), instead to having spent it on share buyback at above current market levels; it would not have spent $15 billion more than it had to. In other words, what ultimately matters is how these buybacks compare with current market levels, and whether this action proved to be a good investment or not. Given that Apple's refined cash holdings (adjusted to account for debt and accounts receivable & payable) are not much more favorable than they were in Q3 2013, and as reflected in minimal 6% increase in shareholder equity in 2.5 years, we believe that in light of upcoming headwinds, Apple shares are still too risky despite Apple's cash. During the past 10 years, Apple shares have generally performed well during the period from July 1 to November 1 of each year, with an average appreciation of about 11.3% (see below table). However, it should be noted that Apple shares depreciated in 4 out of 10 these years, and during the unfavorable macro environment of 2008, Apple shares depreciated by as much as 41.7% from July to November. In most years where Apple has done well during this period, it was primarily in anticipation of the upcoming release of Apple's newest products and versions such as the iPhone. However, despite this positive seasonal performance (with the exception of 2008), the upcoming release of the iPhone 7 is expected to have minimal positive effect at best. As noted by Marketwatch , iPhone 7 is set to disappoint as it is expected to be overshadowed by an iPhone 8 super-cycle in late 2017. During the next several months, the macro environment presents substantial challenges relating to Brexit, Europe and even the upcoming US elections. Such uncertainty is likely to provide strength to the US Dollar, while possibly also having a negative impact on consumer spending (especially in Europe). Apple's international revenues accounted for 67% of Apple's $50.6 billion in revenues for the latest quarter ending March 26, 2016. With such a large share of its revenues being derived from international sales, an appreciation of the dollar, coupled with weaker international consumer spending, can weigh heavily on Apple. Most macro related headwinds will not be specific to Apple, but for the entire market. Nevertheless, Apple's reliance on international sales, as well as pessimism related to Apple's next iPhone 7 release, certainly elevate the risk factors for Apple shares during the next several months. With analysts' earnings estimates of $8.25 per share for the year ending September 2016 and $9.04 per share for the year ending September 2017, Apple shares are currently trading at a forward P/E ratio of 11.44 and 10.44 respectively. Meanwhile, Apple's market capitalization currently stands at $523.4 billion. When adjusting for Apple's cash net of debts, these ratios drop to 8.1 and 7.4 respectively. However, upon a second adjustment for net accounts payable & receivable, these ratios increase to 8.72 and 7.95 respectively. These adjusted P/E ratios are consistent with their levels from October 2013, although upon adjusting for accounts payable & receivable, they have increased slightly from 2013. However, although we deemed this valuation favorable in 2013, given the current headwinds illustrated above, when incorporating related risks, Apple's current valuation is not favorable on a risk adjusted basis (EUR/USD exchange rate averaged 1.33 in 2013, while currently it is at 1.10). There are substantial headwinds during the next several months, which will present challenges to Apple and the market as a whole. Apple will be vulnerable due to its reliance on international sales, driving over 67% of its revenues. In addition, pessimism surrounding the release of iPhone 7, which is overshadowed by the 2017 release of iPhone8, will pose an additional hurdle to Apple. Meanwhile, Apple's cash holdings are not as massive as the headlines imply. When adjusted for debt and accounts receivable & payable, these holdings are at similar levels to 2013. In case headwinds cause upcoming revenues to fall short from expectations, and in case Apple maintains the same dividends and buyback amounts, then these adjusted cash levels could possibly drop below their 2013 levels. On the other hand, in case Apple decreases these programs in reaction to a drop in revenues, then the reduction of this temporary support to Apple shares will provide additional downside potential. Given the preceding, we believe that selling Apple shares at current levels is warranted, with an objective to re-evaluate in several months. Apple shares are simply too risky at this time, despite Apple's cash hoard.
