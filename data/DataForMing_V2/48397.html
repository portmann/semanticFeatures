How to Invest in Technology | The College Investor By Robert Farrington Leave a Comment The technology sector is one of the most popular and profitable investment sectors for many reasons. The fundamental reason is that much of the innovation that drives industry and consumer purchases originates in the tech sector. For the investor, there are two major ways to track tech. The first is by doing the financials: examining charts, plotting profit curves, and keeping up with the latest market trends. The second is to look at the particulars of the company itself: what technologies are they developing, who make up their management teams, and how popular their products are. The approach taken in this article will be to look at the company itself. One of the biggest reasons is that it allows the individual investor to find small nuggets of investment gold that can be easily overlooked when looking only at the financials. Beyond that, there is much information that can be mined by looking at the obvious. Case in point is Apple Computer. When the Apple Watch recently came out, the demand far exceeded the supply. Apple has a history of innovation for consumer products, even though the general perception is their products are priced on the high end. Their management team generally has a long history with the company, so there is a built in corporate mentality on how Apple does business. Compare that to Yahoo or Facebook, both which have frequent changes in management. About every two years Apple has a latest and greatest version of an existing product or the announcement of a new one. All these factors combine to explain the companyâ€™s $194 billion in cash reserves. Mobile technology gets a lot of attention, but there are other technology industries that are stable and profitable, one being hosted VoIP services . While hosted VoIP services do not get the same attention they once used to, there are still many people who invest in this stable technology. Megapath offers technologies that are cutting edge, lasting technologies in todayâ€™s market. VoIP is going to continue to be popular for the long term, while trending gadgets may not have the same long-term durability. Other VoIP companies such as 8×8 hold a higher stock price , and private companies such as Nextiva are patiently waiting for the consumer to catch up with the reality that with the emerging 4G bandwidths VoIP will be as common as the landline telephone once was. Projections are that the VoIP industry will expand from its current base of 300 million customers, and that by the year 2018 the VoIP market will reach $88 billion. In short, there is plenty of room for growth over the next few years. For the investor, the question is whether innovation is preferred over a relatively quiet market segment, that is, Apple over a select group of VoIP stocks. Consider that Apple investors have been somewhat worried about the stagnant growth of its iPad sales in the 4th quarter of last year. A company whose profitability is tied to its innovation can find bumpy roads ahead should the innovation require renovation â€“ or be completely rejected by consumers. In contrast, a stable product such as VoIP that is projected to be a common household and business technology is certain to have consistent, although not flashy, profits. People tend to be attracted to the high profile technologies, and as investors one can get swept away in the new and trendy. There are good reasons to invest in both innovative companies such as Apple and stable VoIP companies like Vonage and 8×8. At the end of the day the question is whether innovators can continue to innovate and remain profitable, or whether stable companies have the ability to quietly grow and manage a consistent return on investment.
