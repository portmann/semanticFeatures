Ford: This Key Growth Driver Will Lead To Better Times - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford has got off to a mixed start in 2016 on the stock market as it does not expect a material improvement in its pre-tax profit, but things should improve. Ford is lining up new SUV launches going forward, which will allow it to tap SUV growth in key markets such as China and India. The SUV market in India is expected to grow 139% by the end of the decade, while SUV sales in China will grow 36% this year itself. Ford has recently launched the Endeavour SUV in India and it is competitively priced, while for China, it has modified its line-up as per local expectations to improve sales. Since SUVâ€™s are high-margin products, Ford will be able to improve its margin profile on the back of growth in both these markets and grow its pre-tax profit. Ford (NYSE: F ) got off to a disappointing start in 2016 even after beating Wall Street's earnings estimates last quarter as the company warned that its margins in the U.S. will take a hit. As a result, Ford's pre-tax profit forecast of $10.8 billion for the current year was not met with enthusiasm by analysts and investors who were expecting the company to post a figure of $11 billion this year. But, there is one key area where Ford is capable of improving its margins - Asia. The demand for SUVs in Asia, particularly India and China, is growing at a tremendous pace, and the good thing is that Ford has lined up new models to make the most of this growth. In fact, according to Ford's Asia Pacific President Dave Schoch , "When I take a look at Ford's growth over the next five to 10 years, we believe roughly 60% of the growth will be in the Asia Pacific region." More specifically, in this market, the Ford executive believes that China and India will be the key growth drivers. In fact, Ford sees China's auto sales hitting 32 million vehicles in 2020, up from 23 million in 2013, and doubling to 6 million in India in the same period. Hence, in order to gain the highest market share, Ford is focused on offering the vehicle categories that are relevant to most of the potential buyers in these markets. And like the U.S., in China and India too, the SUVs and crossovers are proving to be sales drivers. So, in this post, we will try and take a look at the prospects of the SUV market in India and China, and how the company plans to attack this particular market. Ford is not a big player in India with just 2.38% of the market share, but the company's sales have taken off in this market after the introduction of the Ford Figo twins last year. Now, Ford has introduced its new-generation Endeavour SUV, which was launched in January, 2016. The new Endeavour SUV marks the third launch for Ford India in the fiscal year 2015-16 after the Figo and the Aspire. The 2016 Ford Endeavour is based on Ford's T6 platform and retains the bulky and long stature. This premium SUV is priced between INR 24.75 lakh (approx. $37,000) and INR 29.46 lakh (approx. $44,000) in India. In the premium SUV segment , the all new Ford Endeavour is going head-on against contenders such as the Toyota Fortuner, the Chevrolet Trailblazer, and the Mitsubishi Pajero Sport. But, more importantly, Ford has cut its competitors on pricing, with the Fortuner's base price beginning from INR 25.1 lakhs (or $37,400). The following chart clearly shows that the Endeavour has undercut its rivals on the pricing front in India: More importantly, the new Endeavour is the latest generation among all three models. This means that when primary rival Toyota reveals its next generation Fortuner later this year, it will receive a price hike that will make the Endeavour cheaper. Already, sales of the Fortuner in the Indian market are declining , and once it receives a price hike due to a newer model, its sales will fall further. This presents a strong opportunity for the Endeavour, as sales of SUVs in India are expected to go up to 908,000 units by the end of the decade from around 380,000 last year. Since the Endeavour is an SUV, so it will command higher margins than the rest of Ford's line-up in India, which is why I won't be surprised if Ford sees its margins from India getting better. A similar story will be seen in China, where Ford's SUV sales are recovering now. Ford sells its luxury brand Lincoln in the Chinese market. After declining to a 32-year sales low in 2013, the brand finished 2015 on a good note. In fact, it was the first year since 2008 that Lincoln's sales topped 100,000 vehicles in China. In addition, it posted consecutive sales gains in the two years -- 2014 and 2015. More importantly, Lincoln has started this year with an 8% year-over-year sales increase, riding on the success of the all-new luxury midsize SUV - the MKX, which posted a 51% increase in sales. This also marked the best sales performance for Lincoln SUVs since 2001. Now, the Lincoln is just of the high-margin products from Ford's stable in China. For instance, Ford is selling the three-row Edge SUV, which is made for China as opposed to the two-row Edge which suits the U.S. market. The new Edge was very well received in China. Further, SUVs such as the Mondeo and the Kuga, which are the China-market versions of the Fusion sedan and the Escape SUV, respectively, have allowed Ford to improve its margin performance in the Asia Pacific. This is because a sizeable portion of Ford's profit from the Asia-Pacific region was driven by China in the fourth quarter of 2015. Ford clocked a profit figure of $765 million in the region last year, out of which $444 million was made in the final quarter. But, in the same quarter, Ford made $490 million in China from equity income from its two joint ventures, which means that China is Ford's only profitable region in the Asia Pacific. The income from China was up by 52% as compared to the same quarter of 2014, indicating that Ford's SUVs are driving growth in this segment as the company did not gain any market share last year, despite which the profit increased. The trend will continue this year as SUV sales in China are expected to rise 36% in 2016. Since the company has been focused on improving its SUV portfolio in China, I won't be surprised if it is able to capitalize on SUV growth in this region this year as well. Moreover, Ford has announced that it will expand its line-up of sport-utility vehicles by adding four SUV nameplates globally over the next four years, which will give it ample strength to capture the growth markets of India and China. Ford's performance in the two key Asian markets will be driven by SUVs going forward, and since the company is targeting both markets by launching new models, it should be able to gain more traction. As pointed out earlier, since SUVs command higher margins due to their desirability and premium nature, Ford should be able to improve its margins this year, mainly on the back of growth in China, while India remains a long-term play. Hence, I think that investors should not get discouraged by Ford's guidance of "pre-tax profits excluding special items to be "equal to or greater than" the $10.8 billion reported for 2015" as the company is capable of overhauling this target due to reasons stated above.
