That figure is up from 4B in April, and comes as Facebook tests a dedicated video channel and a slew of ad options for its news feed autoplay video ads. Other shared stats: Over 925M people use Groups, 500M people are watching video on Facebook daily, 80M photos/day are shared on Instagram, 1B people use Facebook on Android (compares with 1.55B total MAUs), and 1 out of 5 minutes spent by U.S. users on their phones is on Facebook and Instagram.

CFO David Wehner stated 2016 guidance will be provided with Facebook's Q4 report.

Also mentioned: 1) ~1,000 employees were added in Q3, bringing headcount to ~12K (+44% Y/Y). 2) 2015 capex guidance has been narrowed to $2.5B-$2.7B from $2.5B-$3B. 3) When asked about China (where Facebook is often blocked), Zuck called it a "complex situation," while adding Facebook needs to "try to figure out a way forward on that issue."
