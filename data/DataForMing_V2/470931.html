Facebook Soars After Smashing Expectations: The Quarter In Charts | Zero Hedge by Sprott Money - Jul 27, 2016 11:35 AM The proof is all around you. People are breaking out of the false  realities built for them and they are growing backbones and are asking for  - no, DEMANDING - change. by Steve H. Hanke - Jul 27, 2016 3:18 PM Itâ€™s no surprise that Renzi has his eye on banks. Itâ€™s also easy to see why he is worried and ready to pull the trigger on a state-sponsored bank bailout. So much for any worries about FANGs rolling over. After yesterday's modest AAPL beat which nonetheless resulted in one of the biggest intraday jumps in its stock in history, moments ago Facebook reported results which simply crushed expectations. The street was expecting $6.01 billion in revenue and EPS of $0.82. Instead it got revenue of $6.44 billion, a 59% increase from 2015 - 84% of which came from mobile - and EPS of $0.97 cents, a 94% increase. As the following table of historical Facebook Q2 earnings shows, the only way remains up for the company which continues to gobble up virtually the entire mobile advertising market. Granted, while the data came before the Pokemon Go juggernaut appeared, it was still unprecedented. Here are the details reported by Facebook. Daily active users (DAUs) rose to 1.13 billion on average for June 2016, an increase of 17% year-over-year, and above the 1.12 billion expected Mobile DAUs were 1.03 billion on average for June 2016, an increase of 22% year-over-year, and also beating estimates. Monthly active users (MAUs) were 1.71 billion as of June 30, 2016, an increase of 15% year-over-year. Finally, the biggest factor was Mobile MAUs which soared to 1.57 billion as of June 30, 2016, an increase of 20% year-over-year. Also, if there was any concern about ad revenue slowing down, that too can be ignored for now: Mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 84% of advertising revenue for the second quarter of 2016, up from approximately 76% of advertising revenue in the second quarter of 2015. The stock, predictably, is soaring into new all time high territory, up almost 7% in the after hours session, to new records.

SimpleJackBlack Jul 27, 2016 4:35 PM What exactly do they sell to have revenue? I know adds but are there people buying shit off of a FB add? ironicmerman SimpleJackBlack Jul 27, 2016 4:37 PM soon its MAUs will be exposed as all bots. If you make a fake account on FB and add other bots, you can have 1,000 friends in an hour! ironicmerman rickowens Jul 27, 2016 4:38 PM Never One Roach Rabid Bear Jul 27, 2016 4:40 PM blue51 Rabid Bear Jul 27, 2016 5:23 PM They manufacture a false belief, that people really give two shits , what you think, what goofy things your cat or dog do, or where the hell you are at the moment . So when I play Words  With Friends, but use Adblocker, Facebook is still getting credit for those ads? Ain't advertising wonderful? Professor Know ... Jul 27, 2016 4:42 PM Over a billion confirmed retards on earth.  Thank you for counting them all for us Facebook. It explains why the world is as it is. Kefeer Professor Know Nothing Jul 27, 2016 5:26 PM thismarketisrigged Jul 27, 2016 4:44 PM Is there reliable data on the effective monetary return on facebook ads for the companies that place them?  A friend is asking... At some point, Facebook, which has market cap almost equal to Exxon Mobil, yet brings in only a fraction of XOM's revenue, will be the short of the century. besnook Yars Revenge Jul 27, 2016 5:01 PM looks close. i'd like to see the breakdown in the rest of the world category. i know almost 3bil people in the rest of the world could care less about facefuckbook. those numbers look a little suspicious. last quarter's numbers look like fuckerberg needed some fudge packing this quarter. consumer goods are in the dumper so they increase their ad budgets? since when has that ever happened? is there a new business management strategy? or is fudge packing the numbers the new strategy? taken from its origins in mark to fantasy accounting? And by revising their user agreements on a continual basis, they control and SELL everything they know about you.  Of course revenue is up - Facebook is now tracking people that don't even have Facebook accounts! Talk about inflated numbers; just click on it (that counts) and have multiple accounts (1 person = 3 users) and have the "Hotel Calipornia" (you can never leave), then you can make the numbers keep on going to the moon, then onto Mars.  Some people have 3-5 Facebook accounts. This will dry up eventually as advertisers realize they are getting shafted. The actual number of users is like the way the FED counts employment.  1 worker doing 3 jobs is 3 jobs.  1 FB user with 5 accounts is 5 FB users. If these numbers are remotely true; what does that say about societies.  They are anti-social and bored to death. Note the announcement for both FB and AAPL come after the market is closed; so the perverts can scoop up the cash overnight and the peeps rush in the next morning and give more money to the perverts, then the peeps watch the price back down...and its gone. MZ = disgusting little faggit. He needs to be kicked out of the country for treason. Either that or someone need to decapitate him and his disgusting chink wife. Sandberg needs to by hit with a flamethrower or get gassed.
