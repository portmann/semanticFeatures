Apple Sold 13 Million iPhones On Launch Weekend - That Should Frighten Investors - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple says it sold over 13 million iPhones this launch weekend compared to 11 million last year. Last year excluded China which Apple reports contributes more than 40% of iPhone revenues. Data suggest that non-China launch weekend sales fell from 11 million to 8 million. While Apple crows about launch weekend, Android users grow annually by more than the entire iPhone installed base. If Apple ever builds an iPhone good enough that users want to keep it more than two years, iPhone sales will slump and Apple stock will suffer. The hoopla about the latest iPhone from Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) never seems to subside. Apple says it sold over 13 million iPhones over the launch weekend. Why is that news? What would be news is if the latest iPhone sold fewer than its predecessor. This year the launch includes China where Apple says demand is strong. A top down analysis of the launch weekend suggests tepid demand elsewhere, as follows: Going in to the launch weekend, it would seem from Mixpanel.com data that iPhone sales for the past 30 days have been pretty soft with the percentages of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in use (based on the Mixpanel.com data) pretty well unchanged over the past month. Again, not really news - many buyers wait for the launch of a new device to either buy the latest and greatest or get a discount on yesterday's design. The inclusion of China in this year's launch skews the data. China makes up about 40% of iPhone sales revenue based on my estimates and China is its fastest growing market. If China made up 40% of launch weekend sales that translates into 5 million of the 13 million units shipped over the launch weekend. That suggests only 8 million were sold to the same markets that took up 11 million last year. Even if China were only 30% of the weekend's number, rest of world sales must have declined. The new iPhone does have some fancy features including a novelty Force Touch allowing users to perform different actions depending on how hard they press the screen. We will have to wait and see just how useful that is. A faster processor is welcome, with Apple catching up to the six-month old Samsung S6 with its blistering fast Exynos CPU based on multi-core Geekbench metrics. The Apple fans will tell you to look at the single core performance, which is fair, since unless you are multitasking that's pretty well all you need, and iPhones have not been great devices for multi-tasking. I don't know if that is because iPhones have shorter lives or iPhone users are dissatisfied and feel the need to keep upgrading to try to keep up with their contemporaries using high-end Android devices like the impressive Samsung S6. With a two-year replacement cycle, Apple can milk the installed-base's replacement demand cash cow to the tune of about 200 million device shipments annually. The real danger to Apple is the risk that it will design a device with enough processing power, storage and battery life that its users might keep their iPhones for three years instead of two, with a concurrent dive in iPhone sales. I don't see that as a real risk at this point in time since the iPhone has proven to be at least one cycle behind the industry curve for performance and the installed base will all want to upgrade as the state-of-the-art technologies from competitors continue their relentless advance. With the Android installed base at 1.6 billion users today and a 40% upgrade rate, the Android community has a base demand of 640 million units annually. Total smartphone sales should be 1.437 billion this year according to IDC, with Android capturing 1.164 billion of those. That suggests Android will add 524 million more users this year - a figure greater than the entire installed base of iPhones. Push that trend out a few years and iPhones may become an interesting but irrelevant relic of a strategy to harvest as much profit from a product line as possible with an umbrella so large that Android assemblers have a field day gobbling up the user base. The market is giving Apple a pass for the time being, but in my view not for much longer. Apple profits will remain high but in all likelihood stop growing at any rate fast enough to keep a "growth" label on the stock. If that happens, it may join Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ ) as another big technology company with a price to earnings multiple in the 10x range. BlackBerry (NASDAQ: BBRY ), which once ruled the space, is now joining the Android community in a last-ditch effort to try and preserve a place in the smartphone world. It's a good move for BlackBerry which has always been pretty good at designing a solid device. If BlackBerry can port its security features over to Android it has a chance to survive. Apple has a more compelling problem. It must compete with Android to maintain its "walled-garden" approach to strategy. IDC sees iPhone sales of 227 million for 2015, from an installed base of 395 million. At 50% replacement, 198 million came from existing owners and 29 million from new ones. That compares to the 524 million estimated increase in the number of Android users. At the margin, new smartphone buyers are choosing Android over the iPhone by an 18 to 1 margin. It seems only a matter of time until developers shift allegiance and leave iOS behind. When that happens, Apple fans will have to hope that Apple's plans to build an electric car are big enough and bold enough to take up the slack. That will be quite a trick. Apple is a wonderful company that has made many investors rich beyond their dreams. Electric car or not, that ride is coming to an end.
