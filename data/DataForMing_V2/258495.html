Zen Pencils: Cartoon Quotes from Inspirational Folks and Zen Pencils-Volume Two: Dream the Impossible Dream .     Great inspirational quotes and excellent illustrations. Here are all my book reviews in reverse-chronological order. My favorite book of 2014 was Dinner A Love Story .   It has some inspirational material to help you cook for yourself and your family, along with the best compilation of weeknight dinner recipes I’ve read in a cookbook.  They taste special enough (not bland or boring), but they also take 30 minutes.  I still use it to this day. My favorite book of 2015… I looked back at my book reviews and didn’t really have a strong favorite.   I would say one trend is that I have become a fan of re-reading Vanguard founder Jack Bogle’s classic books .  His old stuff has a lot of common sense reasoning that doesn’t always fit with today’s “one-size-fits-all” advice. ^^^ Nevermind… i guess i thought i was going to a list of your reviews… as in a tabular list, instead of the prior blog posts.
