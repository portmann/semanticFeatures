Verizon Communications: Don't Overlook The Big Picture - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha Shares were down about 2.5% on earnings announcement, a slight miss on revenue expectations was the main reason. Wall St. didn't seem to like Verizon's (NYSE: VZ ) second quarter earnings results. Shares were down some 2.5% on the announcement that the company missed revenue expectations for the quarter. Part of being a good dividend investor, in my opinion, is having one's own expectations for important metrics. These metrics include earnings growth, revenue growth and dividend growth. Verizon is a mature telecom, and investors in Verizon really shouldn't expect high growth. My personal expectations are for 3%-4% growth in revenue and dividends, and about 5% growth in earnings. EBITDA was up 6.6% year on year, which is good. Revenue, on the other hand, was up a lukewarm 2.4%. EBITDA exceeded my expectations while revenue fell a little short. Even by my own expectations revenue was a bit weak. Do I believe Verizon deserved to drop like it did today? Not really, especially considering that Verizon was already undervalued. This article takes a more granular look at Verizon's quarterly results, and does so with valuation in mind. In my last article on Verizon I wrote that high capital expenditures led to free cash flow being well below dividends. Well, over this half-year, capital expenditure dropped from $8.5 billion to $8.2 billion. Verizon's high capex is due to a buildout in both 4G wireless and fiber optic broadband. At a recent roadshow, management quipped that capital spending would not decrease anytime too soon, so I wouldn't look much into this decrease in capex. Another concern many investors have is debt. Last year Verizon issued many bonds in order to acquire 100% interest in Verizon Wireless. As a result, Verzon's corporate credit rating took a hit. Management plans on delevering to get its pre-acquisition rating back. For example, management reduced long-term debt from $11 billion to $10.9 billion over the last half year. That may not be much, but it is a start. I expect further delevering in the following quarters. Verizon also reported its lowest wireless churn rate in three years; just 0.9%. Not surprisingly, the wireless segment outperformed wireline. Wireless revenue grew 5.5% as the company continued to add customers to its 4G service. Retail wireless connections improved 4.7% year-on-year. Wireless EBITDA service margins improved 0.3 percentage points, or 30 basis points. So, overall, the company had some bright spots besides lukewarm revenue numbers. Post paid churn remains low despite an ongoing price war amongst carriers. Post-paid net adds continue to be good, and margins increased slightly. Verizon has a plan to delever, and that plan is 'ongoing.' Yes, revenue only increased 2.4%. While that is a little disappointing, its important to understand that, at this valuation, expectations should already be quite low. For example, according to FAST Graphs, Verizon now trades at 13.3 times trailing earnings, but over the last ten years Verizon has averaged 15.8 times earnings; already a substantial discount. Verizon fell some 2.5% on the day, and now yields 4.7%. My recent thoughts on Verizon's valuation can be found in this article . I've spoken recently about valuation, and so I won't do so again here. Verizon had a good quarter, even though the street wasn't happy with revenue results. Investors should not overlook positive developments in EBITDA, wireless post-paid adds, EBITDA service margins and the churn rate. This is especially true when we consider that Verizon is already undervalued. In my previous article, I wrote that Verizon was a solid buy at this time, and I continue to believe that it is a solid buy after these quarterly results.
