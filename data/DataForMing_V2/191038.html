General Motors Is Crushing It, But Upside Remains - General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) | Seeking Alpha GM's total vehicle sales exploded 12.5% higher last month, while retail sales jumped 17.3% y/y. Strong U.S. economic fundamentals paired with low gas prices explain the surge in vehicle sales. Ford Motor (NYSE: F ) and General Motors (NYSE: GM ) released their sales figures for the month of September last week, and both auto companies crushed it and blew through expectations. While Ford Motor won the gold medal for selling 23% more vehicles y/y compared to September last year, General Motors came in second. The auto maker said it sold 251,310 vehicles last month, 12.5% more than a year ago when it sold 223,437. General Motors' total September retail sales increased 17.3% y/y to 203,895 vehicles. September was an extremely strong month for GM's Chevrolet sales, which carried General Motors' total sales performance once again: Chevrolet sales jumped 10.9% to 170,675 vehicles whereas retail sales increased 19.4% to 134,263 vehicles. Chevrolet sales accounted for ~68% of total GM vehicles sold and ~66% of GM's retail sales in September. Year-to-date, General Motors sold 2,299,847 vehicles, or 4.2% more vehicles than in the first nine months of 2014. Ford Motor, for comparison, grew year-to-date sales 4.6% . Ford and GM are now in an enviable position; their sales are through the roof, and there is no end to growth in sight. There are a couple of themes that are driving auto makers' record sales right now: Low gas prices and a booming U.S. economy. Low gas prices certainly have helped fuel sales of pickup trucks and SUVs, which become more attractive when energy costs decrease. Further, the unemployment situation in the U.S. is slowly getting better, which in turn has a positive effect on consumer spending. The U.S. economy added 142,000 nonfarm payrolls in September according to the Bureau of Labor Statistic's press release from last Friday. While the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 5.1%, auto makers are without a doubt reaping the benefits of an improving spending climate. Booming domestic sales also come exactly at the right time for U.S. companies. With China's economy slowing down, surging U.S. sales help General Motors and Ford Motor to offset declines outside the United States. The Federal Reserve will probably hike interest rates later this year, if you take Yellen's comments from two weeks ago seriously. Personally, I think the rate hike is overdue and the Fed will make a move this year. The question, though, is: Will a Fed rate hike hurt auto makers? Unlikely. Interest rates should rise when the economy is in an economic upturn, which is the case in the United States. A rate hike poses some risks, but more so for auto makers' stocks rather than their sales outlook. Put differently, a Fed rate hike is no reason to sell auto companies at all. It is, in fact, the most normal thing in the whole world. General Motors' September sales blew past expectations. Auto makers in the U.S. are seeing very favorable market conditions: The U.S. consumer is hungry for new pickup trucks and SUVs, employment is high, gas prices and interest rates are low. From that standpoint, auto sales can grow further in the months ahead, with or without a Fed hike. Buy. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
