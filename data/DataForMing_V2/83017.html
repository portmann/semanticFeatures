Apple Credit Spreads Say Bank Of America Is Not Too Big To Fail - Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) | Seeking Alpha Jun.  9, 2015  3:25 PM ET  |  About: Bank of America Corporation (BAC) , Includes: AAPL , C , JPM , WFC by: Donald van Deventer Some argue that the biggest banks in the United States are too big to fail. The "certain" government rescue gives them a competitive advantage over their smaller bank peers. One counter example shows this argument is false. Apple has dramatically lower credit spreads than Bank of America Corporation. Apple also has a dramatic credit spread advantage over the U.S. Dollar Cost of Funds Index, a composite of BAC, C, WFC and JPM credit spreads. It is often argued that the largest financial institutions in the United States are too big to fail. They, the argument goes, get an implicit subsidy in their funding costs from the United States government that gives them an unfair competitive advantage over their smaller banking peers. If this argument has merit, a "too big to fail" bank like Bank of America Corporation (NYSE: BAC ) should have lower credit spreads than any other corporation that does not have an implicit government guarantee. One graph proves that the "too big to fail" argument is completely false. The chart below plots the credit spreads for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) (in brown) vs. the credit spreads for Bank of America Corporation (in black) as of June 8, 2015. The graph makes it very obvious that Apple Inc. credit spreads are dramatically lower than Bank of America credit spreads: What does this dramatic advantage in credit spreads imply? It implies that Bank of America's probability of failure is not zero. In fact, its probability of failure is much higher than the probability that Apple Inc. will fail. A more subtle implication is that bond investors are stuffed with Bank of America bonds relative to their appetite for more bonds from Apple Inc. By any measure, Bank of America Corporation is not too big to fail. The same comparison can be made between the credit spreads of Apple Inc. and the U.S. Dollar Cost of Funds Index. The U.S. Dollar Cost of Funds Index measures the trade-weighted cost of funds for the largest deposit-taking U.S. bank holding companies. The index is a credit spread, measured in percent and updated daily, over the matched maturity U.S. Treasury yield on the same day. The current bank holding companies used in determining the index are Bank of America Corporation, Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C ), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM ), and Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE: WFC ). The index is an independent market-based alternative to the Libor-swap curve that has traditionally been used by many banks as an estimate of their marginal cost of funds. Kamakura Corporation is the calculation agent, and the underlying bond price data is provided by TRACE and the U.S. Department of the Treasury . The plot of Apple Inc. credit spreads (in black) versus the credit spreads of the four big banks underlying the U.S. Dollar Cost of Funds Index again shows lower spreads for Apple Inc. across the board: What is the conclusion? There are two possible conclusions. One is that investors don't believe that the U.S. government is certain to rescue the biggest banks in America (again). The other is that some investors believe in a rescue but they don't manage enough money to drive the credit spreads for the big banks below those of Apple Inc. The National Association of Securities Dealers launched the TRACE ( Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine ) in July 2002 in order to increase price transparency in the U.S. corporate debt market. The system captures information on secondary market transactions in publicly traded securities (investment grade, high yield and convertible corporate debt) representing all over-the-counter market activity in these bonds. Kamakura Corporation calculates the exact matched-maturity Treasury yield (NYSEARCA: TLT ) for each bond using data supplied by the U.S. Department of the Treasury . The credit spreads used are the difference between the trade-weighted average yield on each bond less the matched-maturity Treasury yield.
