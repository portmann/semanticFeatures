Thank you for joining Telenav's third quarter 2015 earnings call. In the third quarter we generated total revenue of approximately 42 million, up 6% sequentially and up 23% from same quarter last year. This is our third consecutive quarter delivering sequential revenue growth and our second quarter in a row that Telenav has achieved both sequential and year-over-year growth since we began our transition from premium mobile navigation into the high-growth businesses of automotive and location-based mobile advertising. Our Company’s vision is to become the global leader in transforming life on the go. To achieve this vision, we have been successfully repositioning Telenav for sustained growth by getting into much larger and growing opportunities which leverage our historical, technical and business capabilities. Today, revenue from automotive and mobile advertising businesses contributed over 79% of total revenue in the third quarter. Now let me provide you with our strategy and progress update in our four focused investment areas. First, connected cars, second, location-based mobile advertising, third, OSM and fourth, LBS and big data platform, first, let me start with the connected car. As I described last quarter the connected car will be disruptive through the auto industry. Our strategy is to leverage our industry-leading embedded connected navigation solution, and user-friendly brought in solution to build strong relationships with our auto OEM partners. In doing so, we'll be well-positioned to build up large scale network of connected cars with our cloud services. We can further broaden and deepen those relationships by offering other value-added software and services for strengthening the auto OEM relationships with end cars consumers. Evidence of our successful execution to-date is our long-term relationship with Ford and recently announced partnership with GM. As a reference Ford and GM combined have approximately 18% of the global automotive market. Today we are in active discussions with most of the top-10 global OEMs with a goal to create the largest network of connected cars in the world. Total automotive revenue was up 22% quarter-over-quarter and 61% year-over-year. And the overall loyalty revenue was up 11% sequentially and up 59% year-over-year. We are pleased to announce that in the third quarter we had record total revenue and loyalty revenue from Ford, primarily driven by growth in Ford Europe. We have announced in January that GM another top-5 global auto OEM partner. Launched OnStar RemoteLink mobile companion app powered by the Telenav LBS platform, this is part of a broader global strategic partnership including embedded connected navigation services with GM. As I have stated in prior quarters we anticipate the GM relationship will have the revenue opportunity comparable to Ford. As we announced last quarter, we continue to work to close our previously announced award with another top-10 global auto OEM for the China market. We have made good progress towards a binding agreement and we have commenced joint product development work. Within the connected car industry, we have seen that the announcement of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto bring Telenav increased interest from auto OEMs who look to bring better user experiences and differentiate their connected navigation offerings from the brought in solutions. The differentiation that Telenav brings to the table is the design expertise, and advanced technologies to improve user experience significantly to embedded navigation systems, which have traditionally had a bad reputation due to outdated map data and poor visibility. We have been investing significantly in solving this target and have created industry-leading innovative solutions. For example our real-time map update technology which we will call true delta is helping us to earn more opportunities with many more global OEMs. We continue to invest a significant amount of our auto resources into future opportunities and technologies. We are confident there are many huge opportunities in the connected car space that kind of allow us to achieve significant return on investment in the long run. We believe we have positioned ourselves well for the tremendous opportunities that will emerge as connected cars become smarter and more and more mainstream. With already contracted OEMs we'll have access to more than 18% of all vehicles produced globally and with future effort our goal is much higher. As we continue to grow market share we have a foundation for us to bring more value to our end-users via car services and also bring new monetization via more targeted and driver-friendly advertising and then many other value-added services including usage-based insurance, personalized and proactive maintenance services and mobile commerce. Let me now turn to another specific investment area, Location-Based Mobile Advertising business. In the third quarter, we had a record quarter of bookings which exceeded 50% growth sequentially. We are very encouraged by the bookings and it is a direct measure of our sales productivity and the market adoption of our solution. However in the March quarter, we had a seasonal effect of our clients doing forward and full year planning and as a result the ad spending projects was spread over a longer period of time. We also saw more of our bookings occur in the later part of the quarter. As a result, we reported revenue of $4 million or 10% of total revenue, up 38% year-over-year but down 15% from the prior quarter which was lower than our expectations. However, we expect revenue will grow significantly next quarter due to these record bookings. One of the key drivers for our growth is the opportunity in the auto sector. Today we have six of the top-10 global auto OEMs leveraging our platform for targeted advertising for sales and the maintenance services. In the third quarter, we viewed upon a large $1 million order we announced last quarter and in the March quarter that same auto OEM renewed with another order of over $1 million which is a strong validation of the value it will bring to the auto OEM industry. We’re seeing synergistic services in both our advertising business and our auto business due to our unique positioning in the way in which we can serve auto OEMs today and into the future with the new technologies and business model. Other encouraging methods within mobile advertising includes, deals over 50,000 has the number had almost doubled, the location enabled impressions amount increased from 240 billion in December to 254 billion in March. Our success in the locations-based mobile advertising is based on our product depreciation which we will continue to make investments in. Our mobile advertising is all about location together with intelligence from many sources of data that allow us to anticipate customer needs and wants and stay one step ahead of the decision-making process and makes advertising more effective. Yesterday, we announced that this year our advertising deal has been named a Gartner Cool Vendor in Mobile Marketing for 2015. This year was one of the four vendors Gartner highlighted as driving innovation in the mobile marketing space, focusing on the use of location intelligence to effectively target customers with relevant and timely advertising and the ability to measure its impact on behavior, it is considered a big honor to be recognized by Gartner as a leader in the mobile marketing field. I am pleased that we exit the third quarter with record bookings in mobile advertising and we believe that our mobile advertising strategy is well aligned with the rapidly growing mobile advertising market. The third area of investment is in OpenStreetMap, OSM. Last quarter I’ve discussed in detail Telenav’s OSM initiatives. Let me reiterate the importance of this area of investment. Recent discussions of Nokia Mapping division here have brought renewed focus on the value of maps in the market today. As you know we have invested in the consulting approach with OpenStreetMap which provides a much lower cost in creating underlying data and enables more frequent updates. The reason we have invested in OSM is because it provides a superior option as you look to the future of map tracing and maintenance. Today we continue to invest in technologies build upon OSM which we call OSM square, that allow us to automate map creation and real-time updates by leveraging sensors from mobile investors and connected cars. We continue to believe that device map solutions are going to provide significant long-term technical advantage through those who control those assets. As an example, our connected cars will require high-quality immediately refresh mapping services in order to ultimately deliver upon the promise of the self-driving vehicle. We believe there will be many other applications for OSM that will emerge in the future. We don’t expect significant near-term revenue from these initiatives but it will provide significant opportunity for value creation for Telenav long-term. Finally, let me touch on another area of focus for investment, Location-based services and Big Data platform. We continue to invest in our LBS services through our Scout product our Scout SDK product and support for our carrier business with AT&T and other carriers. These investments are focused on delivering high-quality cloud services capabilities which we leverage for both our LBS services and our auto businesses. We’ll continue to support these efforts at levels consistent with the requirements to maintain revenue opportunities and to develop and extend our core technology capabilities that support our other businesses. As a reminder this LBS services also provide a platform to collect valuable data points for multiple user bases. This first party data collection capability provides Telenav with a unique data set distinct from that available to other companies. As we grow our data collection capabilities via our scalable Big Data platform through distribution of the Scout SDK and through our connected car relationships we will be able to more effectively leverage this data across our businesses. As an example this unique data specifically supports our existing advertising business with differentiated insights for our clients for third-parties. Another example is we're leveraging this data to provide more personalized search to our auto LBS customers such as Ford and GM. In summary, we are very excited with the success we are having in achieving a successful business transformation, as we have achieved our third consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth and we're confident that the foundation we're building through our investment is going to provide a great future for Telenav. The large and rapidly growing market of connected cars and location-based mobile advertising along with our Company's strong early position in both nascent markets presents the Company with a unique opportunity to become a global leader. Telenav is making significant investment today to become a dominant player in this target markets which will yield large long-term sustainable revenue growth. While this may keep our overall operating costs higher in the short-term, we believe the size of the long-term opportunity justifies this investment level. As we do this we are mindful of optimizing our cost structure and ultimately returning the company to profitable. Thanks H.P., as a reminder this portion of the presentation as well as H.P.'s remarks contains forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review our risk factors in our most recent Form 10-Q on file with the SEC which set forth risks and uncertainties that may affect these forward-looking statements. Let me now discuss results for the third quarter in more detail. Revenue in the third quarter was $42.3 million compared with $39.8 million of revenue in the prior sequential quarter and $34.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal year '14. Overall revenue grew sequentially as well as year-over-year driven by growth in our automotive business. Automotive revenue for the third quarter was $29.5 million or 70% of total revenue compared to $24.1 million or up 22% sequentially and $18.3 million or up 61% year-over-year. In the third quarter we achieved a record for royalties earned on vehicles shipped with our navigation solution, which has totaled $25.8 million up from $23.2 million in the prior quarter. This sequential growth was driven primarily by continued success with Ford in Europe. In addition we recognized $3.7 million of customized engineering fees in the quarter in conjunction with the upcoming launch of the new Ford SIC3 platform as compared to $900,000 in the prior quarter. It is important to note as we have indicated in the past revenue earned from customized engineering fees can vary significantly quarter-to-quarter and by region due to the timing of new platform launches and new feature sets. Mobile advertising revenue was $4 million or 10% of revenue compared to $4.7 million or 12% in the prior quarter and $2.9 million or 8% of total revenue in the prior year quarter. The sequential decline in revenue for mobile advertising is attributed to the combined effect of booked campaigns running over longer periods of time and bookings that occurred later in the quarter. In the third quarter our largest customer Ford comprised 68% of total revenue compared to 50% in the year ago quarter, with Ford truly being a global customer Telenav’s navigation solution has now been deployed on vehicles across North America, China, Europe, South America, Australia and New Zealand. Our second largest customer AT&T comprised 13% of total revenue compared to 25% in the year ago quarter. Total gross market for the quarter was 51%, flat sequentially and down from 59% in the same quarter last year. The year-over-year decreasing gross margin was driven by the shifting revenue mix towards automotive which carry relatively lower gross margins as compared to the Mobile Navigation segment which is declining in revenue. Gross margin within the automotive segment was 47% in the third quarter improving sequentially from 45% due to a larger amount of customized engineering fees recognized in the current quarter, which earned relatively higher gross margins. Gross margin declined from 53% in the same period last year. The year-over-year decline was primarily attributable to a higher proportion of revenue earned on vehicles sold in Europe and China in the March 2015 quarter which have higher associated TomTom cost and lower gross margin. Gross margins in mobile advertising were 33% in the quarter up from 30% in the prior quarter and down from 40% in the year ago period. The sequential increase was due primarily to the seasonal effect of lower ECPM cost for display ad inventory sourced from third-party exchanges in the March quarter while the year-over-year decline reflects an increasing trend of higher ECPM cost for display ad inventory. Excluding the effect of amortization of intangibles non-GAAP gross margin was 44% up sequentially from 39%. Within mobile navigation gross margin remained relatively flat sequentially at 73%. Gross margin was up slightly from 71% in the year ago period. Research and development cost in the quarter were $17.4 million up from $16.6 million in the prior quarter and up from $15.8 million in the March quarter of last year. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to the inclusion of $2.6 million of product management cost in this classification in the current quarter offset by continued cost optimization efforts. Recall that effective in the first quarter of fiscal year ’15 the Company is including product management cost as a component of R&D expenses due to the change made effective July 1, 2014 whereby this function no longer reports into the sales and marketing organization. Previously such costs have been included within sales and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses were $6.9 million up from $6.7 million in the December quarter and $8.9 million in the same quarter last year. The year-over-year decrease was primarily related to the exclusion of product management cost in sales and marketing in the March quarter of last year as mentioned previously offset by higher cost associated with the ongoing expansion of our mobile advertising sales team. General and administrative expenses were $5.7 million flat with the prior quarter and down from $6.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal ’14. The year-over-year decline in G&A costs was primarily attributable to lower headcount related costs as well as lower cost for professional services. We experienced a net loss for the third quarter of $4.8 million or $0.12 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $2.7 million or $0.07 per diluted share in the prior quarter and a net loss of $7.6 million or $0.19 per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal year ’14. We generated an adjusted EBITDA loss of $4.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal year ’15 as compared to a $4.8 million loss in the prior quarter and $6.8 million loss in the third quarter of fiscal ’14. Turning to the balance sheet. We continue to be debt free and ended the March quarter with approximately $131.7 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased in the quarter by $3.6 million due primarily from the receipt of proceeds from tax refunds totaling $11 million offset by adjusted EBITDA results and other operating uses. We ended the quarter with 596 full time employees, a decrease from 605 at the December 2014 quarter-end. I will now turn to guidance. But before I get into the specific numbers let me talk more generally about automotive. As H.P. indicated, we are quite pleased with our momentum in the automotive segment as demonstrated by our year-over-year quarterly revenue growth of 61% this growth story has been achieved primarily due to our global success with Ford and having fully penetrated all 24 Lincoln models in North America as well as deployment across vehicles manufactured and imported in Europe and China. As we look towards the future, royalty revenue with Ford will be driven by an expected higher production volumes including expansion of manufacturing capacity in China in particular, penetration across more overall vehicle models in China and Europe as well as achievement of higher overall embedded navigation take rates. Turning to our second top-5 auto OEM, General Motors. As we have previously reported, there are two principle products we are providing as part of our relationship. The first product released in January relates to our cloud-based mapping and search service that is offered as part of the GM RemoteLink mobile application. You may recall we have replaced Microsoft, Bing Maps and search for RemoteLink. We earn a one-time royalty for each new vehicle owner who downloads the RemoteLink application. Our feature is currently offered as part of a three to six months pre-trial to owners of new GM vehicles and upon free trial expiration as part of an optional purchase premium subscription service. However, our contractual delivery obligation for this service extends for 12 years and consequently revenue recognized is currently being amortized over this extended tender. During the quarter, royalty billings related to this product amounted to $3.8 million of which less than $100,000 was amortized and recognized as revenue and the remainder is recorded as deferred revenue. Revenue recognition on this product may vary depending on future usage patterns. As to the more significant second GM product in embedded connected navigation solutions and as we originally announced in January of 2014 we anticipate this product will be launched by GM in our fiscal year 2017 but that this launch will be initially limited in volume. Our expected revenue will be dependent upon GM's own model-by-model and geographic rollout. While we anticipate GM revenue for fiscal year ’17 to be modest we do expect that deployment of our navigation solution in fiscal year ’18 and beyond to be more rapid than what we have experienced in our Ford relationship. Let me now discuss selected highlights of our business outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal year ’15 and the full fiscal year. As a reminder, the full guidance is disclosed in our earnings press release. Our expectation for the June quarter are as follows; total revenue is expected to be $44 million to $46 million; GAAP gross margin is expected to be 46% to 47%; GAAP net loss is expected to be $8 million to $9 million. Our adjusted EBITDA loss is expected to be between $6 million and $7 million. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2015, our business outlook is as follows; total revenue is expected to be $161 million to $163 million; GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately 50%; GAAP net loss is expected to be $24 million to $25 million; adjusted EBITDA loss is expected to be $22 million to $23 million. With that, H.P., Hassan and Loren and I are available to take your questions. Operator, if you can please open the line for questions. Thank you. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Greg Burns from Sidoti & Company. Just had a question on OSM, I understand the benefit from a cost perspective and a technological perspective for Telenav for their own platform or applications. Can you just give us a little bit more color on -- so you have the opportunity to provide incremental services beyond your platforms other parties, like what would be the potential upside outside of just using OSM on your own platform? So as I think we talked quite a bit before about our SDK the Scout SDK is built on top of OSM so we do have customers as we announced before both at our 2.50 and that’s kind of a mobile application sector they also specific of vehicles like e-bikes, and motorcycles those are the unique areas of our SDK they build upon the OSM can be utilized to provide navigation mapping services. And so there are opportunities for loyalty payment from that service, there are also other opportunities like advertising in the future. Now turning to the ad business I guess you’re running around 33% gross margins now as that business scales their upside for the margin profile of that business? So I think the way to think about gross margins in that business Greg is look at the non-GAAP gross margin which I believe is 44% in the quarter and that difference reflects the amortization of some of the intangibles that emanated out of the acquisition. Having said that consistent with our previous remarks we think there is opportunity for operating leverage in that business where gross margins can over the next two years, can trend towards 60%. We started to see some of that improvement this quarter as well. And we’re cautiously optimistic that we continue that we can start to obtain slightly higher CPMs on the revenue side from that business. That would also be a driver for that improved gross margin. Another thing I can add to that is -- so there are two type of inventories one is from exchange third-party inventory which is mainly for display ads there are also our own inventory which is more search ads or even for displays ads in the future those areas the left inventory will have high margins right now volume is relatively small but we are investing in that area to grow that items if we’re successful in achieving that then that will also help our margin. And then lastly in terms of OpEx came in a little bit lower than we were expecting this quarter and I guess the guidance implies a little bit lower than you had originally targeted. Can you just discuss what was driving that and I know we’re not giving 2016 guidance here but directionally how should we be look at OpEx out of the fourth quarter? Sure Greg as I’ve indicated over the course of the past few years we’ve been very focused on optimizing our cost structure and we continue to do that especially in light of the fact that one of our core business segments is declining in revenue and gross margin. And so the headcount numbers that we shared this quarter actually showed a decrease in headcount while we are in fact adding headcount in some of our strategic growth areas. So for example to drive our advertising business for we’re aggressive in hiring on the salesforce side but at the same time in other parts of the business we’re trying to be as prudent as we can and managing that cost structure. So looking forward as you can see in my guidance there is a slight increase in the fourth quarter we’re just starting our fiscal ’16 planning. So it would be premature for me to give any specifics around how we’re thinking about that cost structure going forward. But -- and I would say because we’re so excited about the two large growth segments of our business we are going to be investing in those areas. We will be prudent. But you shouldn’t be surprised if you see some slight upward movement in our operating cost structure. Maybe I want to add a little more to this one. I think the cost structure in the future will depend on the opportunity we’re gaining from auto OEMs a lot as well as we get more like deals there is some time we have to invest earlier before revenue can be realized. To start on the auto segment, what are you seeing on embedded take rate sort of quarter-to-quarter I know you’re not going to give a precise number. But as you look at your royalty from Ford relative to either their production or their sales in the quarter do you have any sense as to how it is trending and maybe the magnitude? We are seeing we believe a slight increase very low single-digits in take rates in North America which arguably is maybe a little more of a mature market in the sense that we have penetrated all of those vehicles. But we see quite large divergence by model as we talked about in the past we believe that Lincoln take rates are north of the 90% range and where we've seen some of the best successes on the low-end vehicles the Ford Focus is under the traditional Ford trucks that have had low take rates in the past so we think the market opportunity of embedded navigation for the lower end of the market is especially attractive for us, there's a number of factors that drive that as well here in the states and that has to do with the $795 price point that Ford is able to offer that solution for as well as the fact that more vehicles are going to be outfitted with screens in the head unit for rear cameras which we think can help drive more sales around navigation. Outside the U.S. and I alluded to it in my prepared remarks we think we're going to see some significant growth in China as they build more plants, it’s still early for us to gauge what take rates outside the U.S. might be like because we haven’t penetrated all of those models yet we don’t have enough history but it attracts what we've observed in the U.S. that's certainly though China and Europe in particular are large growth markets for navigation to continue to grow for us with Ford. And then in terms of the models that you're on for Ford it sounds like you're pretty much everywhere you can be in North America, what about Europe and China, in other words are you solely based on increased take rates and additional production or are there still some models in those regions where you can win or add that way? Yes, so, as you all know China's the fastest growing auto market and Ford has plans it seems that are launching for the first time every six months and so those two primary vehicles that are sold in China as I understand are the Ford Cougar and the Mondale and we have penetrated those models and so those are kind of the drivers of volume. The second half of fiscal '15 that we're in Ford is also launching with the Ford Focus, so I think that's probably the next highest volume vehicle, so we do expect increased growth in China, commensurate with more plant capacity and higher organic take rates. With regard to Europe this is really our, only our third quarter and I made a remark earlier in my script that there was growth from Ford Europe, I'm not providing specific numbers by region going forward anymore only because there're different approaches in these regions and the manner in which they forward order for inventory fulfillment and so while in the U.S. there's a just in time inventory approach in other geographies they will run inventory at varying levels particularly in China where they're building more plants. So at any given quarter revenue can increase or decrease and it's really, it may not be an indicator of really what's happening in the business, generally speaking we're continuing to see healthy growth in both Europe and China, but we're not providing specific numbers for each of those regions for the reasons I just indicated. Okay, that's good color Mike, thanks. And then last auto question as it relates to GM, what is their MO, in other words, it doesn't sound like it's going to be sort of a running switchover in the second half of next calendar year is it based on when that model, when the '17 model year for that model is released? Yes, so it's just some clarity as I've indicated in the past, the first product a larger embedded connected relationship, we expect the first launch with General Motors in Fiscal '17 which is essentially the fall of calendar year 2016. And so our remarks there as we expect that to be relatively limited volume at the outset and then moving forward our relationship with them is initially a three year production cycle and so by the end of that three year production we think we're going to have some deep penetration and some rapid growth that at the end of that tenure we think will be larger than what Ford was at that point in time. But I guess my question is, is what is the methodology that they're using is it when a certain model year starts production or is it they're going to take it one at a time as they see fit or what is their methodology for rolling you guys out? Yes, so they're decentralized in some respect because they've operating divisions based on brand so they can vary based on that but as we understand it they are going to be launching our solution across various models that might be more mid model in tenor as opposed to the approach that Ford took where they only launched our solution on the first year of a new model. That's kind of the nature and expense of the specifics that have been shared with us, you know we're always hopeful that can get fast forward sooner because we’ve developed the technology but it’s really a product roadmap rollout that General Motor owns and controls. And it can be forward as well. But we’re very attentive and certainly once we launched with them where we tracking that extremely closely much like we do today with Ford. Two more quick ones from me, thanks, the mobile advertising business bookings you indicated was a record up 50% quarter-over-quarter. Can you give us some magnitude as to what the bookings number is and then how those orders are generally recognized overtime? Yes, so we don’t want to get into the specifics every quarter of tracking another non-GAAP metric for a number of reasons. But what I would tell you is the healthy bookings that we did achieved has resulted in proving us additional visibility into the realization of our forecast and the guidance that we put out there. So as we look forward for example to the guidance that I’ve provided in the June quarter now that we have the very robust backlog we’re confident that we’re going to be able to attain the range of guidance that I’ve provided. And the good news is that healthy backlog is not only helpful in thinking about the business going forward for the next quarter but it gives us much more visibility into two and three quarters out. And so what we’ve seen with regard to just buying patterns from our incumbent and new customers is they’re not just spending ad money with us for discrete campaign we have become more and more a part of their overall mobile ad spending strategy. And so they’re committing a budgeted amount that they can spread across various campaigns that they’re still in the process of defining. The good news with all of that is we have been extremely successful north of 98% of being able to fulfill all the insertion orders that we contract with our advertisers. And so generally speaking a contracted insertion order does manifest into revenue. And what we’re seeing is that’s happening over multiple quarters from an initial buy. So hopefully that’s helpful. Let me give you a little more insight on that one. Basically the booking normally last few months the length of campaign so the booking number is higher than our revenue number. But it is higher but it’s not like several times higher. So I continue with that level on other level of insights. And then lastly the legacy wireless business that was a little bit softer than I had anticipated this quarter is that -- I mean did you have some acceleration in the rate of fall off there or was there an anomaly? No I am not sure to be honest Steve and I’ll go back and double check those numbers. But I think they were right in alignment with my guidance so I think maybe if you’re comparing to the prior quarter we did have a one-time item in the last quarter of I think about $800,000. So on the surface that might have looked like it declined more but generally we’ve been seeing pretty consistently across all of our telecom carriers it’s about 3% to 4% monthly churn. Very minimal, it’s mostly attributable to royalty revenue growth. And just add to that Greg it’s a little healthier for quarterly ramps than what we’ve seen in the past. So we don’t have deep insights into all the drivers on that. Is it due to higher take rates, we know there is more capacity coming on in China and much of that is being driven at from outside the U.S. which I think is a good indicator but I think the point you’re observing is that ramp is in the double-digit percentages, which is higher than what we typically have seen. And I guess in terms of GM, where are we in terms of I guess the upfront work that needs to put in on that for that partnership should we expect NRE revenues to be higher than normal next year or not? Well, so what we talked about GM and NRE revenue what we typically what we have said in the past is all the customized work that we expect to derive from that relationship is generally built into the peace price as part of the contract. As you might expect overtime as there continues to be collaboration and new features offered there is the opportunity that there could be additional customized engineering that we might recognize in a lump sum. But generally speaking, all the customized engineering which we’re doing with General Motor’s relationship is built into the peace price. And we’re flexible with all of our automotive customers, some of them prefer to have lump sum amounts allocated for the upfront development work and others want to spread that over the course of the relationship and amortize it into the peace price. So, we try to be relatively flexible. At the end of the day, it is all about the ROI on the overall relationship is how we think about the business and what the business can become, the relationship can become with them. And in terms of Thinknear I guess you had the nice recognition from Gartner this quarter. Who’d you call out as some of your primary competitors in that space or some of your more direct comps? Yes, so the direct cost of that base is really three other companies that have somewhat similar focus of Thinknear, xAD, PlaceIQ and Verve Mobile are the three companies that are sort of focused directly on the space. And then there is a selection of other companies that are doing different things around location but they’re not really targeting the space in exactly the same way that we are over sort of the attacking location generally in the same way that we are. So those three companies would be the ones I would call out. And quite frankly each of those companies has a different approach and tactic in terms of the marketplace. It’s still even though we’ve been in it for a while it’s still likely a very new involved in the space for the advertisers. And so I think each of the companies you sort of taking a different look at how to attack that market. I imagine it will converge overtime and so right now those would be the companies I would call out. And this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I’ll turn the conference back over to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks. Great. Thank you, everyone for joining us this afternoon. And we look forward to updating you again next quarter. Bye-bye. This concludes today’s presentation. Thank you for your participation.
