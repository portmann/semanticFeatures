Apple: Closing The AI Gap - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha The recent developer conferences of Microsoft and Google have featured impressive work in artificial intelligence. Apple's AI capability appears to lag its competitors. The recent developer conferences of Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) have highlighted these companies' ambitious plans for Artificial Intelligence (AI). Based on these plans, some have concluded that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is falling dangerously behind in AI, but we haven't yet had the opportunity to see what Apple has been working on. Apple's upcoming World Wide Developer Conference (WWDC) will be an opportunity to showcase its own work in AI, and it needs to share this work with developers. One of the main themes that emerged this year from the developer conferences of Microsoft and Google has been the increasing prominence of AI in their devices and services. As I reported in Microsoft's Bold Vision of Pervasive Artificial Intelligence , Microsoft foresees natural language interaction as the new computer user interface. The vision is nothing new, but we're now much closer to making it a reality. Large Web services companies can host AIs within their hyperscale data centers that learn from user actions, and are very context aware. Most importantly, Microsoft offered developers an unprecedented set of tools for building AI into their Windows apps using Microsoft-hosted Web services. Likewise, Google unveiled at its IO developer conference a similar vision for Google Assistant . Google highlighted its work in AI and its success with AlphaGo in defeating a human Go player. Google's intention is to make search "more assistive" by allowing the AI to learn from user actions and search queries, as well as improving voice searches through improved voice recognition. The reader may not realize it, but the principal application for AI right now is in search. Google's search engine is an AI that learns from your search queries in order to anticipate future queries. That's why autofill works as well as it does in Google search. The Google Assistant would take that a step further by monitoring your actions through Google connected devices such as Android phones. The privacy implications are fairly obvious here, but the whole idea is that the Assistant can be more effective by knowing where you are, what apps your using, and provide context aware suggestions and assistance. In the AI visions of both Microsoft and Google, mobile devices and AI are natural partners. Mobile devices can't be very smart (yet), but they can serve as useful connections to the data center hosted AI. The mobile devices can also provide a wealth of information about what the user is doing (always, we're assured, with the user's permission). It's clear that Microsoft and Google hope to leverage their AI capability in order to sell their platforms. This apparently prompted entrepreneur/developer Marco Arment to write a blog piece If Google's right about AI, that's a problem for Apple . It's an interesting, thought provoking piece, but Arment may not have employed the best analogy in comparing Apple's situation in AI to Blackberry's situation with respect to the disruptive iPhone. The analogy provoked one of Daniel Eran Dilger's long diatribes on why Apple isn't like Blackberry . Arment, writing shortly after Google IO, sees a large gap between where Google is and where Apple is in AI. He writes: If Apple needs strong AI and big-data services in the next decade to remain competitive, they need to have already been developing that talent and those assets, in-house, extensively, for years. . . And I just don't see that happening. Becoming a major big-data AI services company doesn't happen completely in secret and suddenly get released to the world, completed, in a keynote. It's a massive undertaking, spanning many years, many people, and a lot of noticeable interaction with the world. It's easier to conceal the development of an entire car than a major presence in AI and services. I believe Arment overstates his case. If it were any other company besides Apple, I would probably have bought the argument concerning secrecy. But this is Apple. Furthermore, I doubt that Apple's AI activities have attracted much attention from the media. We all know Apple's just a device company, right? And what the media want to know is what the next iPhone looks like. It's media attention that leads to information leaks out of Apple. The media haven't cared much about what Apple might be doing with its own Siri AI assistant. In fact, there has been an interesting leak concerning Siri, published recently in the The Information , and recapped in numerous other publications such as Forbes . The gist of the rumor is that Apple is going to provide APIs for developers to access Siri along the lines of what Microsoft and Google have announced. If such APIs are in development, they would likely be rolled out at WWDC. Although Arment may overstate the gap between Apple and its competitors in AI, there is a gap, and it's mostly to do with that key AI function of search. Apple's search capability just isn't as good as it's competitors. You can see this for yourself by trying the following experiment. I asked this same question of both Siri and the Google app on an iPad: Siri produced a quote from Wolfram Alpha explaining kinetic energy. Close, but not quite what I was looking for. Google on the other hand produced exactly what I was looking for: Okay, it was sort of a trick question. The fact that Siri didn't know Einstein's formula shows that there is a gap, but not a huge one. Apple has been investing substantially in search. That's what Apple Maps was all about. Maps was much maligned in the media, I think partly because of the threat it represented. Every year at WWDC, Apple has taken its search capability a little further. Apple's Spotlight is very much a context aware search capability, but it doesn't quite rise to the level of Google. I expect that at this year's WWDC we'll see further progress in search. Arment is right to be concerned about the AI gap, but it may already be smaller than anyone outside of Apple realizes. He also underestimates Apple's ability to close this gap through its R&D investments, as well as acquisitions. Apple's R&D isn't just about figuring out the right contour for the next iPhone case. Apple's R&D is spread over a number of areas, and much of it is pure software. However, Apple needs to show a bit more of its hand to investors and developers at WWDC. Enhancements to search and Siri will be key areas for investors to look for. Arment seems to think that Apple is just clueless about AI, despite the fact that Apple introduced Siri before Microsoft introduced Cortana. I don't think Apple is clueless about AI at all. Given the fact that we've seen rollouts of AI APIs for developers from Microsoft and Google, that's probably a good indicator of the state of technological maturity in the field. Apple will probably introduce similar technology at WWDC. Search remains an area requiring additional investment, and investors should look for signs of greater search investment at WWDC. I believe, based on its financial resources, increasing R&D, and existing investments in Siri and search, that Apple can and will close whatever AI gap still exists. I remain long Apple and recommend it as a buy for investors with a 3-5 year investment horizon. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
