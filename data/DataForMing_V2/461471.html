Boeing, The World's Biggest Jet Maker, Loses To Airbus - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Boeing's Commercial Airplanes department has higher revenues. Using the unit-cost method the Airbus Commercial Airplanes department is running more efficiently. As a writer of aerospace articles, focusing on the duopoly between Boeing (NYSE: BA ) and Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSF ), I often hear how one company is selling planes at huge discounts at losses while the other jet maker is using some suspicious accounting method. People slightly familiar with the duopoly and financial statements know which statement can be connected to the which jet maker. From Airbus it is often said that they aggressively discount their aircraft to win market share. About Boeing it is often said that the company uses orthodox accounting methods to increase profits. In this article I will focus on the profit and revenues per delivered commercial aircraft to see which company brings its shareholder more profit and which jet maker is operating more efficiently. To get an idea of which company manages to book more profits on its commercial aircraft department I will use a fairly simple approach: I will look at the revenues, profits over the past 4 years, the number of deliveries and the per airframe figures. Additionally, I will look at the figures from the 2015 financial statements of each jet maker. Figure 1: Annual Revenue Airbus Commercial Aircraft (Source: www.AeroAnalysis.net ) Figure 1 shows that revenue of the commercial aircraft department has increased from $41.5B in 2012 to $50.6B in 2015. This is equivalent to an annual growth rate of 6.8%. The accumulated revenues over the past 4 years total $182B. Figure 2: Annual Profits Airbus Commercial Aircraft (Source: AeroAnalysis.net ) Figure 2 shows that profit of the commercial aircraft department has increased from $1.27B in 2012 to $3.1B in 2015. This is equivalent to an annual growth rate of 34.3%. The accumulated profits over the past 4 years is $8.9B. One thing that can be calculated from the revenue and profit figures is the margin. The margin increased from 3.0% in 2012 to 6.1% in 2015. Measured over the past 4 years the margin figure was 4.9%. Using these figures we can see how the revenues and profits per airframe developed over the past few years: Table 1: Revenue and profit per airframe for Airbus What can be seen is that the revenue per airframe has increased from $70.7 million to $79.7 in 2015. This increase in per airframe revenue is caused by a change in delivery mix for the Airbus A320, which is increasingly focused on the Airbus A321. A similar thing occurred on the Airbus A330 program, where Airbus increased deliveries of the bigger A330-300 model. Additionally, the Airbus A350 entered service which positively impacted revenue per airframe. Over the past 4 years the average revenue per airframe has been $73.8 million. Profit per airframe jumped from $2.2 million in 2012 to $4.8. Prospectively Airbus has applied an accounting method similar to Boeing for the early A350s that are delivered to customers. Without this change in accounting method the profit per airframe would have fallen to $4.3 million in 2015. Boeing reports its profit according to the program accounting method. The company, however, does also provide the unit accounting results, which is useful if you want to make an apples-to-apples comparison. Figure 3: Annual Revenue Boeing Commercial Aircraft (Source: AeroAnalysis.net ) Figure 3 shows that revenue of the commercial aircraft department has increased from $49.1B in 2012 to $66.05B in 2015. This is equivalent to an annual growth rate of 10.4%. The accumulated revenues over the past 4 years is $228.15B. Figure 4: Annual Profits Boeing Commercial Aircraft (Source: AeroAnalysis.net ) Boeing uses the program accounting method, which heavily skews the results. Although I think it is fair to use program accounting, I will be using the unit-cost accounting figures primarily. For convenience I will be mentioning the program accounting figures as well. Using the unit-cost accounting figures, profit has swung from a negative $3.7B to a positive $2.67B. Using the program accounting method, profit has swung from $4.7B to $5.16B, peaking at $6.4B. Using the unit-cost accounting figures the margin increased from -7.6% in 2012 to 4.0% in 2015. These figures were 9.6% and 7.8%, respectively, for the program accounting method. Measured over the past 4 years the margin figure was -1.2%. Using these figures we can see how the revenues and profits per airframe developed over the past few years: Table 2: Revenue and profit per airframe for Boeing What can be seen is that the revenue per airframe increased from $81.7 million to $86.7 million, reflecting a bigger share for the Boeing 787 in the delivery mix. At the same time the highly dilutive impact of the Boeing 787 production can be seen, as it completed dragged Boeing profits per airframe into the negative for the past few years. In terms of total revenue Boeing has a firm lead. Over the past 4 years it realized a revenue of $228.15B versus $182B for Airbus, which is 20% higher or almost $10 million per airframe. In 2015 Boeing booked a revenue of $66B, compared to $50.6B for Airbus. So in terms of revenue Boeing is still having a lead. However, with an announced cut on the Boeing 777 program and a rate increase on the Boeing 737 program to compensate for the lower revenue, Airbus is likely to close the gap a bit in the coming years as it ramps up A320 production rates and Airbus A350 production matures. For the comparison of the profit figures, I think it is fair to use the unit-cost method. At the same time, it needs to be noted that Airbus is using an accounting method similar to Boeing's program accounting for the first Airbus A350 deliveries. Profit booked by Airbus over the last 4 years equals $8.9B. If we subtract the Airbus A50 accounting, we get a profit of $8.56B or $3.45 million per airframe. Boeing's unit cost accounting method gives a loss of $2.7B or $1 million per delivered airframe. So in terms of absolute profit and profit per airframe, Airbus has been leading over the past few years. In 2015 Airbus booked a profit of $3.1B, reduced by the Airbus A350 accounting this is $2.74B. Boeing booked a profit of $2.67B. On a per unit basis this is equivalent to $4.3 million for Airbus and $3.5 million for Boeing. What can be concluded is that the actual profit figures for 2015 are pretty close, but Airbus needs less airframes to realize this profit. The margin for the past 4 years for Airbus was 4.4% versus -1.2% for Boeing. In 2015 this was 5.4% for Airbus and 4% for Boeing. What can be concluded is that Airbus indeed has a lower revenue per airframe, but this also has to do with the jet maker's production being focused on narrow body aircraft. I consider the role of competitive pricing to win market share to be less reflected in the company's financial statements than some believe. On the other hand, it can be confirmed that Airbus has a more profitable commercial aircraft department. What needs to be noted is that although some might not like Boeing's accounting method, it brings much more stability to the company's share price performance. Airbus' accounting method forces the company to take charges when the company is experiencing difficulties, due to its relatively small block size. Boeing on the other hand gives itself more space to recoup costs. While Boeing is lagging in terms of profit, I think its unit-cost results have shown that the company is heading in the right direction. Additionally, the introduction of new production methods that require less manpower should help the jet maker in improving its margins. If executed wisely both jet makers should be able to expand margins. However, Boeing could be facing a big charge on the longer term while Airbus could be facing (several) charges if maturing process of the Airbus A350 slows down.
