Etsy: Mauled By Bears, Can Bulls Recover? - Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY) | Seeking Alpha Bears mauled Etsy stock price by sending it down over 28% to $13.78. The cost of Handmade at Amazon may limit the number of Etsy sellers thinking of moving. The stock price of Etsy (NASDAQ: ETSY ) was crushed after the release of earnings. The stock fell to $13.78, down $5.45 or over 28% on the day. Etsy's stock is flagged as hard to borrow, with over 10.5 million shares sold short as of July 15. Today the Bears won. Product listing growth at Etsy continues to increase, see chart below. The growth in listings is encouraging as it shows sellers continue to engage and list products. There has been some concern in the market that new Handmade at Amazon marketplace might affect listings. Listings flat-lined in late May and June but have grown nicely since June 30. The flat-line in listing growth might have been a result of negative reports on counterfeit goods and the Amazon handmade initiative. Whatever the reason, it appears that listing growth has reappeared. This is a welcomed development. Will Etsy sellers jump ship after building a following on Etsy for a new Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) platform? Some might. However, it reminds me of sites trying to lure eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY ) sellers' away decades ago. Jumping to a new platform will require time and effort to learn. As the saying goes, "time is money." Additionally, the goodwill and reputation built on Etsy will require establishing on a new site. Will established sellers want to start from scratch? Some might, but many might not. Then there is the question of the search results that track back to Etsy. A seller that abandons Etsy may confuse buyers and or help the sales of the sellers that stay. Competition can be good for the marketplace, so the Amazon offering should not be feared. Competition can make all platforms stronger and dynamic. It might also help expand the handmade market. On Amazon a search on "handmade" returns 5,547,802 items. On Etsy, the handmade category returned 23,973,573 items while a search on "handmade" returns 3,206,338 items. Amazon may have a larger user base, but Etsy has more handmade items listed. A search on eBay for "handmade" returns 3,688,309 items. Again, Etsy has more items with fewer sellers. A product handmade by one of twenty employees is okay. A product handmade by one of one-hundred collective members is okay. However, a product handmade by a different artisan is not okay. What happens if the artisan is one of the twenty employees, or one of the one-hundred collective members? MarketWatch has an article titled "Angry at Etsy, sellers and buyers may eye Amazon." In part, it says: "We believe many sellers angered by the increasing presence of mass-manufactured and counterfeit goods on Etsy are likely to shift items to Handmade at Amazon," the analysts wrote. Might the sellers and buyers consider products made by 20 to 100, as permitted by Amazon to be "mass-manufactured?" I think they might. If so, they might decide it is not worth moving to Amazon. A Professional Seller account is required for artisans to list on Handmade at Amazon . The $39.99 monthly fee ($479.88 annually) will be waived until August 1, 2016. The yearly Amazon seller fee exceeds the average gross merchandise sales ($458.60) generated by the average Etsy seller, see table below. The yearly cost of Handmade at Amazon might limit the number of Etsy sellers that could benefit from a move. Without a broad offering of handmade items, it is unclear how attractive the Amazon marketplace might become. Amazon and eBay are major competitors, however; their size might hinder attracting the craft or handmade seller. The Handmade at Amazon platform is not currently live. So the size of the product selection is unknown. Comments on the Etsy discussion board suggest that some sellers appear interested in expanding where they list items and not deserting Etsy. Revenue came in at $61.4 million; GMS totaled $546.2 million with 1.484 active sellers. Overall, it was an uninspiring report. Quarterly revenue increased to $61.365 million from $42.509 million from the prior year. The year over year revenue growth rate was 44.4%. Gross profit increased to $39.456 million from the previous year level of $25.164 million. The gross profit margin was 64.30% up from 59.20% the prior year. Gross Merchandise Sales per prior quarter active seller was $382.49 versus $386.32 the prior year. The GMS per year ago active seller was $458.60 versus $464.48 the prior year. Active sellers grew to 1.484 million from 1.191 million the prior year. This is a 25% increase year over year. Revenue per ending seller was $41.35 up from $35.69 a year ago. Listing at June 30, 2015, totaled 31,979,806 or 22 listings per prior quarter active seller. The GMS per ending listing was $17.08. Gross merchandise sales per quarter end active seller is expected to accelerate in the next few quarters as the holiday selling season approaches. The gross merchandise sales miss is a concern; however, the revenue and active seller metrics were encouraging, as is the listing growth. The next two-quarters will be watched closely. Bad debt expense was $1.642 million the past six months or 1.37% of revenue. This compares to the previous quarter $0.767 million or 1.31% of revenue. During 2014, the six-month bad debt expense was $0.511 million or 0.62% of revenue. Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenue was 0.96% in 2014, 0.80% in 2013, and 1.74% during 2012. Not sure, what happened, but reducing bad debt expense could help improve earnings. It might be worthwhile for management to consider a listing cap for new sellers as a way to help control bad debt expense. The weakness the stock price before and after earnings may provide investors a decent entry point. Risk adverse investors may consider the sale of at-the-money puts to enter the stock at a below market price. The purchase a 50% position and selling both an at-the-money call and a put might offer an attractive entry and or exit point given the high implied volatility of the options. September 15 Call at $0.65 ($15.65 effective sale price or 4.3% return on strike) September 15 Put at $2.35 ($12.65 effective purchase price or 15.7% return on strike) Sale of 15 Call and Put generates $3.00 in a premium, an effective sale price of $18.00 or purchase price of $12.00. Projections for quarter ending September 30, 2015: 1.619 million: Active Sellers (26% yearly gain) $594.1 million: Gross Merchandise Sales ($367 GMS/seller * 1.619MM sellers) $367.00: GMS per Quarter End Seller (1% yearly gain) $ 67.1 million: Revenue ($594MM GMS at 11.30% Rev to GMS) $ 42.4 million: Gross Profit (65.00% margin on $67.1 million revenue) The Bears mauled the stock price, but the bulls may regain the upper hand should listings continue to grow, or the Handmade at Amazon rollout is delayed or uninspiring.
