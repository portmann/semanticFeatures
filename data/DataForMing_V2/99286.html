ETF Hub Jun 26 2015, 19:18 ET | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor A short 8-K amendment filed by Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS ) notes that CFO Jay Rasulo -- who was set to leave his role on June 30 -- will continue at the same salary (and bonuses) as adviser to CEO Bob Iger. That means he could earn $5.4M in the coming year. He was reported to have a $1.75M base compensation along with $3.42M in restricted stock awards. Last year he earned another $11M in bonuses, for a total of $16.2M. He was already set to help with transition to a new CFO, who hasn't yet been named. Rasulo was once considered to be a contender as Iger's replacement at CEO, though the promotion of Tom Staggs to COO in February made Staggs the most likely heir.
