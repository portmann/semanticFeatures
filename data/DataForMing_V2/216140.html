Fitbit And Apple Watch Can Coexist - Fitbit, Inc. (NYSE:FIT) | Seeking Alpha I think pricing of Apple Watch has left room for Fitbit to potentially thrive. The wearable tech market is one with massive growth potential and Fitbit is poised to capitalize on it. Many investor criticisms that I have read do not seem to understand the product and its competitors in real-world scenarios. Fitbit valuation forces the investor to take a leap of faith regarding the company's future and the very real uncertainties it holds. This is my major obstacle. My first experience with fitness trackers was a disappointment and I expected any and all such devices to get wiped out once Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) released a watch. Things appear to be turning out a little different than I initially thought. I think Fitbit (NYSE: FIT ) can survive and do well in a world with Apple Watch for the following reasons: Fitbit products are priced at a level where consumers don't need to fear damaging them (I don't run with my iPhone for this reason and wouldn't run with an Apple Watch if I had one) Fitbit is simple and focused with regard to functionality Fitbit is establishing a desirable brand and ecosystem to differentiate itself Fitbit continues to improve the quality and offerings of products Apple Watch has been priced higher than I expected. While I do anticipate the Apple Watch will do very well, I believe the price points have kept the door open for lower-priced fitness trackers such as Fitbit to coexist. Additionally, Fitbit has done much to improve the product performance, appearance and especially the overall Fitbit brand (see new commercials ). The social component of Fitbit is great and very important, but not entirely unique to their product. This social component combined with other improvements mentioned is what can help make the difference. Essentially, I think Apple has left room for Fitbit products to carve out a niche and do well. I also believe that Fitbit is doing well in trying to capitalize on the opportunity. As I have said elsewhere , I believe wearable products like Fitbit currently makes and like what Apple is making with the Apple Watch are potentially on par with what the iPhone was when first released in 2007. At the time, the iPhone had basically no apps, no GPS and made little waves with regard to sales. Today, many look at Fitbit and Apple Watch and may be underwhelmed. It's easy to forget that many felt the same way about the first iPhone. Similar to the evolution of the iPhone, I'm confident these products also will look very different and come with lots of new features to increase demand in coming years. A notable value add of late is the addition of designer Fitbit trackers . The number one rule of wearables is appearance. The number two rule is functionality. Fitbit has done well with appearance already - the new designer line takes this to another level. Make no mistake, I don't at all believe Fitbit is the next iPhone. But the company is a significant first mover in the wearables space and has a real chance of becoming a permanent fixture in what will be a massive industry. Another factor for me considering Fitbit as an investment is the scale of what the relatively new wearables market has the potential to be. "The Wearables Revolution is going to make a lot of people a lot of fortunes over the next five to 10 years, as people start buying three, five or even 10 wearable computers for every one smartphone they have." - Willard, 25 Stocks for the Wearables Revolution Precise numbers can be hard to pin down, but there are approximately 2-2.5 billion smartphones in use around the world today and estimates for the end of the decade vary between 4 and 6.1 billion ( TechCrunch / Economist ). If projections are accurate that many will eventually own three to five different wearable tech devices (think watches, glasses, sunglasses, shoes, clothing, etc.) then the wearable market by end of decade could easily be on its way to exceeding 10 billion devices sold. I do not expect this market to be close to maturing at that point, but these numbers can help to begin to frame the potential. I have read arguments that Fitbit will suffer at the hands of both Apple Watch and lower-priced Asian competitors. I also have read criticism that Fitbit products are no more effective than a basic and inexpensive pedometer. While from a practical standpoint I can appreciate these critiques, I personally believe they are not in touch with the consumer mindset. Basic pedometers have been around for decades - this is nothing new when it comes to valuing Fitbit. Fitbit has taken the pedometer and made it useful and desirable. Fitbit builds community among friends, it looks cool, and functions well. They also are building a brand that portrays a lifestyle that people want to be a part of. Regarding the fear that cheaper imports will materially hurt the company, I believe the brand and social power they are building has the potential to protect them on this front. I'm not dismissing this as a threat, but I don't expect it to be quite the threat others seem to make it out to be. As previously mentioned, I think Fitbit is poised to do well in the niche fitness tracker market and potentially in the broader fitness wearables industry over time. Due to price points and functionality, I no longer see smart watches as the direct competitor to Fitbit fitness trackers that I once expected. The biggest concern regarding Fitbit is present valuation. At the time of writing, Fitbit had a valuation around $7.47 billion. Doing some very basic calculations we could project end of year revenues for 2015 to be approximately $1.475 billion if we assume the second half of the year is similar to the first (this accounts for no impact from the holiday season). That would represent an annual revenue growth rate of 230% from 2014. It also means Fitbit is trading at around 5x revenues at present. Gross profits are up around 245% from 2014 making the same assumptions we did with revenue. All this growth is exciting, but the future is a question mark, making it hard to know how quickly Fitbit may be able to grow into and exceed present valuation. This is where much of the present risk lies in my opinion. Fitbit still needs to prove they can thrive beyond the fad factor. I believe Fitbit has a lot of promise and the company has successfully changed my opinion that fitness trackers are of little value. The company appears to be doing a lot of the right things to become successful over the long haul while riding the wave of wearable tech and an increasing focus on personal health. It appears that Fitbit may have a nice niche that differentiates them from Apple Watch based on price and focus while adding enough value to largely protect them from cheaper competitors. Valuation is the biggest obstacle for me. I'm long in my portfolio , but barely. As with any new company like this in a hot industry, if they succeed, this could be a big home run. The problem is that all future projections are just that, projections. I would be leery of making a large investment due to valuation and notable future uncertainty, but a small, speculative position could be a worthwhile move for someone who believes in the story and opportunity.
