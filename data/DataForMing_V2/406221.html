Apple iPhone 7 Rumors Aren't Rumors Any Longer - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Mark Hibben makes the case that iPhone 7 rumors are not to be believed. There are strong reasons why these rumors are no longer rumors. As a result, they are to be believed, and all possible consequences from that fact are to be expected as likely. On Thursday morning, Mark Hibben published an article - Apple: Nikkei Declares iPhone 7 Dead Before Arrival - where he dispels Nikkei's claim that the Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPhone 7 will do badly. Nikkei comes to this conclusion because of the iPhone's lack of novelty. Mark Hibben challenges this conclusion because he thinks that the present iPhone 7 rumors are not to be believed. That Apple always changes the design of the iPhone significantly after an "s" cycle, and as so the rumors about a rather unchanged iPhone 7 must somehow be wrong. I will, in this article, clarify why Hibben is likely to be wrong regarding his assertion that "A fresh design is the least Apple can do." The Rumors Are, At This Point, Not Rumors My argument is very simple. At this point in time, the rumors regarding the iPhone 7 are past the rumor phase. These rumors should more reliably be termed "leaks." While some of what you see in the rumors are indeed renders, a lot of what you see are actual prototypes and actual parts. Indeed, Hibben himself showed one such prototype which was not a render, it was a physical phone held in someone's hand: This reality, that we're dealing with leaked prototypes and parts, stems from the fact that it takes a good while to arrive at both the final product and production process. This is not unlike producing a car (though faster). Well before the car reaches the public, you can already find prototypes going about in the wild, and leaks of them in the specialized press. Moreover, the timing bears this out as well. Let's for instance check what was known by May 12, 2014 when Apple was about to transition from the iPhone 5s to the iPhone 6 (in September of that same year). These were the kind of leaks you could find then: What do these photos mean? They mean that the leaks we are seeing today are near certain to represent the final product. So, indeed, the iPhone 7 design won't diverge strongly from the iPhone 6/6s design. Which, as Nikkei puts it, should be a problem for sales. It will also represent a break with Apple's past, like Hibben said. And I think Hibben himself agrees that this break will be unfavorable for sales. Moreover, the break is starting to be worrying in another sense: why is Apple doing this? Why did it launch the iPhone SE with a 4-year old design? Is Jony Ive not around anymore, or at least not designing iPhones ? If the rumors prove true and the iPhone 7 is as undistinguished as expected, I would definitely feel the need for regime change at Apple. But I'm certainly not to that point, yet. I'm willing to give current management the benefit of the doubt until we see the real product. I remain long Apple and recommend it as a buy for investors with a 3-5 year investment horizon. This is a small aside, but the camera bulge inconsistency is easy to explain. The iPhone 7 will come with just 1 camera and the same or smaller camera bulge. It is the iPhone 7 Plus that will have the larger bulge and two cameras. That's the phone pictured in Hibben's article. There is no inconsistency. While most reviewers said that the Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) S7 did not have significantly changed design versus the Samsung S6, this is easily shown to be false. Just visit any store and test the two - the design and ergonomics are very different: The Samsung S7 is more akin to the Note 5, with a much curvier back making it much more pleasant to hold. It also has curvier front glass. The Samsung S7 Edge also has a curvier back than the Samsung S6 Edge (though less than the Samsung S7). This, too, makes it much more pleasant to hold. The Samsung S7 Edge display is less curved at the sides in the front, the distortions at the curve are minimized and the display feels as if it goes from edge to edge. In this, it beats all prior smartphones. In short, the Samsung S7 and S6 feel like 2 very different smartphones from a design and ergonomic standpoint. And besides, at most they could be labeled the second generation of the same design -- whereas the iPhone 7 would be the third. On top of many other risks Apple took which ultimately led to it seeing shrinking revenues, Apple will now be taking the risk of not changing the iPhone 7 design much. This is unlike past Apple history and brings with it significant risk of stagnated to lower-still sales, when compared to the already-shrinking iPhone 6s. While the iPhone 7 might still give rise to the pattern of AAPL outperformance in the month leading to its launch, I believe that it having a very similar design is going to lead to underperformance right after. This underperformance will hit both the stock and actual sales of the smartphone unless Apple pulls out some kind of innovation rabbit we're not seeing right now. I do expect the iPhone 7 Plus to have extraordinary camera performance, though - possibly reclaiming the crown in that department.
