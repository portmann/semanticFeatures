Has Apple Created The World's Fastest Smartphone? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha The new iPhone 6s and 6s Plus feature Apple's new custom processor, the A9, which may make the 6s the world's fastest smartphone. The faster A9 chip translates into enhanced real world capabilities such as 4K video capture and editing. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) introduced next-gen iPhones at its September event with the expected improvements: a new A9 system on chip (SOC), a force measuring screen, and a 12 Mpixel camera. Rumors had even gotten the new "rose gold" color and stronger aluminum case alloy correct. Were there any surprises? Yes. Apple's A9 is much faster than the A8 in the iPhone 6. If Apple's performance claims hold up in actual device testing, the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus will become the world's fastest smartphones. Rumors that had been circulating prior to the September event suggested that iPhone 6s would feature only incremental improvement in SOC speed for the A9. Since it was a given that the A9 would be fabricated on a FinFET process (either Samsung's 14 nm or TSMC's 16 nm process), all the performance gain could be attributed to the new process. The implication was that Apple had done nothing with the previous generation A8 design other than a die shrink in going from the A8 20 nm TSMC process. At the September event, Phil Schiller more or less confirmed that the A9 was being fabricated on a new FinFET process, which he referred to as a "new transistor architecture," without being specific about the silicon foundry used. No surprise there. What was surprising was the claimed performance boost compared to the A8: 70% for CPU tasks and 90% for graphics processing (GPU) tasks. Apple qualifies the claims by prefacing the numbers with "up to," so we don't know exactly how fast the new phone will be in specific tests. But the claims are consistent with what Apple claimed for the A9X in the new iPad Pro: 80% CPU improvement compared to the A8X in the iPad Air 2, 100% GPU improvement. Although Samsung's Galaxy S6 was released after the iPhone 6 and featured Samsung's 8 core Exynos 7420 SOC fabricated on Samsung's 14 nm process, the iPhone 6 manages to stay competitive with the Galaxy S6 in most tests. In Geekbench single core tests, the iP6 tests out faster than the Galaxy S6 , while in multicore tests, the S6 is faster. In Anandtech's more comprehensive suite of tests, the iP6 was nipping at the heels of the S6 most of the time. If Apple's claims are realized, the iPhone 6s will leapfrog the S6 in performance by almost every measure. Why is this important? Aren't these benchmarks just academic? Not really. Processor speed affects virtually every aspect of the user experience. Since the days of the first Apple computers in the 1970s, increases in processor speed have been translated into increased capability and utility. The features we now take for granted in mobile devices such as HD video recording and playback are only possible due to the advances in processors since those early days. Apple's faster A9 enabled many new capabilities in the iPhone 6s. These include 4K (3840 x 2160) video recording and image processing for the new 12 Mpixel camera. In addition, iPhone 6s can even edit its own 4K movies in the iMovie app. Apple's new "3d Touch" (Force Touch by a new name) also benefits from the faster processor, as does Touch ID. 3D games will also become more detailed and lifelike by virtue of the new processor, as demonstrated by PixelToys at the September event . The race to build ever faster processors continues to drive innovation at all levels of personal computing. It's significant that the fastest smartphones available are made by the two companies that are leading what I have termed the paradigm shift away from "commodity" processors to custom designed SOCs: Apple and Samsung (OTC: SSNLF ). I fully expect Samsung to leap frog Apple again when it introduces its next generation of Galaxy devices. This competition will continue to drive innovation and serve to differentiate the two companies from their commodity competition. I've been preaching the benefits of custom SOCs and the paradigm shift away from commodity processors in mobile devices for years now, so I tend to take it for granted. I was interested to read an article about the iPhone 6s by Farhad Manjoo in the NY Times. In the article, Manjoo observes that Apple has bucked what he assumes is the dominant trend of commoditization, but seems puzzled as to why. He concludes the article by assuming that it must be due to Apple's superior integration of hardware and software. He's right, of course, but he's also missing the most important piece of the puzzle. If Apple were saddled with using a commodity processor, from Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) or Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ), Apple's ability to create discriminators against its competitors would be severely limited. Apple and to a lesser extent, Samsung, have only been able to occupy the premium tier of the smartphone market by virtue of their custom SOCs. I've chosen to focus on the speed improvements of the new iPhone because they have been largely overlooked by the tech media. Following the September event, a collective yawn seemed to emanate from the media regarding the "incremental improvements" of the new iPhone. Ever since Apple introduced the first 64 bit SOC in a smartphone in the iPhone 5s, the media have tended to underestimate the importance of Apple's faster processors. The faster processor, combined with features such as 3D Touch and the new 12 Mpixel camera, provides important advantages going in to the all important December quarter. My sole disappointment with the 6s is the lack of any multitasking features available on the iPad Pro. Clearly this was a marketing driven decision, not a technical one, as the 6s Plus could easily implement multitasking. It's probably a measure of Apple's confidence in the sales prospects of the 6s. With only about 30% of the iPhone user base converted to iPhone 6/6Plus, Apple has a lot of room for sales growth. Furthermore, the discounting of the iPhone 6/6Plus should help drive sales. Most analysts tended to damn the new iPhone with faint praise following the event. For instance, Gene Munster, an Apple bull, predicted 4% y/y unit sales growth in fiscal 2016. I expect y/y iPhone unit growth in the low double digits, based on Apple's more than incremental improvement of the iPhone 6s and the availability of discounted iPhone 6/6Plus models. There may be headwinds in China, as I've discussed previously , or the speed improvements may turn out to be less than I expect. Apple's fiscal Q4 results, reported in October, will give investors an opportunity to reset expectations, if necessary. I expect, if anything, expectations to be set higher.
