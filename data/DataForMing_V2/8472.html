At Pre-Bust Valuation, Is Apple Getting Ahead Of Itself? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple shares have risen past their 2012 pre-bust valuation on a trailing earnings basis. The release of the Apple Watch and the new MacBook design failed to impress and the companyâ€™s refresh cycle on iPhones may hit demand later in the year. Shares could be worth $116.96 on consensus earnings of $8.60 per share in 2015 on the three-year average multiple of 13.6 times trailing. After a brief selloff following its new product announcement, shares of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) have rebounded over the last week. Beyond the failure of the launch event to impress audiences, shares are richly valued and sales in coming quarters could be weaker than expected on a refresh cycle that has become too hurried. New investors should wait for a better entry point while current investors may want to hedge their downside risk with options. Apple shares have increased past their lofty valuation hit before the 2012 bust on a trailing basis. The shares currently trade for 17.4 times the last four quarters' earnings. While this is still a discount to the valuation on the S&P 500, it is quite high for a relatively mature company. For another gauge of market sentiment, I added the price multiple on each earnings release for the current quarter plus expected earnings for the next three quarters. At the beginning of the September 2012 bust, investors were willing to pay 15.4 times for current plus three quarters worth of expected earnings. While the shares have not yet regained the valuation high on this forward basis, it may be because of expectations for an average 27% in earnings growth over the next three quarters. Looking at historical growth in earnings, on a year-over-year basis, in the chart below shows that expected earnings growth over the next three quarters may be difficult to achieve. Against a stretched valuation, new products may not be as popular as investors would hope. Apple made the long-awaited announcement of its smartwatch earlier this month, along with updates on the MacBook and new battery technology. Consumers and investors alike have been waiting for the big watch announcement, hoping the Cupertino giant could do for wearables what it did for MP3 players. Early reports from a Reuters/Ipsos poll suggest that investors may be getting ahead of themselves if they are looking for the watch to support the stock's high valuation. More than two-thirds of the people surveyed (69%) stated they were not interested in buying the watch and 52% thought that smartwatches were just a passing fad. The new MacBook design , at just two pounds and 13.1 millimeter, recevied just as much attention as the watch but not all of it good. While I have seen some reviews that were absolutely glowing, it seems that the general opinion is less than Apple would have hoped on this one as well. Besides cutting the laptop to just one port, many have complained that the dual core processor is just not powerful enough for today's computing needs. The watch and new MacBook are beautifully-designed and will sell as status symbols, as Apple products always do, but investors may be disappointed if they are hoping for record sales on function as well as form. Beyond the potential for disappointment on sales of the watch and new MacBook, the company may have an issue with its refresh cycle on the iPhone this year. The first iteration of the iPhone 5 , released September 2012, was a little disappointing and only accompanied by an upgrade of the 4S. This was a year after the earlier iteration and the shares started to tank on fear of weak sales as the product cycle stagnated. It seems Apple has turned 180 degrees on its product refresh cycle and has come out with three new iPhone versions (5C, 5S and 6) in just two years since September 2014, along with multiple version upgrades. The iPhone 7 is expected in September of this year, along with new versions of the iPhone 6. The ramped up refresh cycle, along with the watch and new MacBook this year, could strain consumers and sales might not be able to continue setting records. If sales fail to meet high expectations, the company will need to become more profitable to meet earnings consensus but may be reaching its limit on margins. An operating margin of 29.7% on the last four quarters' results is 100 basis points above last two years' margins and well above the average of 24% over the last 10 years. Operating profitability sank 6.6% in the year to September 2013 on higher expenses due to the product refresh cycle and contributed to the 27% drop in shares. With the feverish product cycle this year, I'm not counting on strong profitability. Analysts are expecting sales to surge 23% this year to $225.7 billion, leading to 33% growth in earnings to $8.60 per share. First quarter earnings easily beat expectations but sales and earnings later in the year could fall short on products that have failed to wow consumers and a refresh cycle that seems a little sudden. If sentiment were to drop to 13.6 times trailing, the average over the last 12 quarters, the stock could come down to $116.96 on consensus earnings of $8.60 per share. A high valuation by historical standards and product factors that could result in weak sales might convince Apple investors to take a bite out of the current enthusiasm. New product releases failed to live up to the hype and investors seem to be putting their faith in record iPhone sales for every product cycle. New investors may want to wait for a better price while current shareholders may want to hedge with options. Source: At Pre-Bust Valuation, Is Apple Getting Ahead Of Itself?
