Avoid Hewlett-Packard Ahead Of Earnings - Hewlett-Packard Co. (NYSE:HPQ) | Seeking Alpha Chances are good HP's PC division will disappoint investors again. Intel and Micron already indicated a weak personal computing market. Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ ) is not faring well on the stock market, despite plans for splitting itself in an attempt to maximize shareholder value. The problem is twofold. First, investors are punishing companies reliant on the PC market for revenue. Second, the split itself is adding another layer of uncertainty for the company. When the company reports quarterly results on August 20, 2015, chances are high that HP will show a further drop in PC sales. This will mean the stock will not outperform the market in the near-term. Investors are punishing HP due to expectations sales from the PC market will weaken. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU ) are down sharply, which is also hurting shares of HP: Micron faced weak DRAM average selling prices due to weak demand and excess supply in its third quarter. PC DRAM sales accounted for around 30 percent of all memory sales. Due to falling demand in the low-end markets, Micron said it would focus on higher-end products, including DDR4. The company does not expect an improvement in demand in the desktop market until later this year. On its second-quarter conference call, Intel experienced a year-over-year drop in desktop and notebook volume. Revenue in the second quarter fell by 5 percent year on year. Sales from the Client Computing group fell $7.5 billion, down 14 percent from last year. Conversely, Intel's sales for high-end computers were good. Demand for the Core i7 processor reached record highs. Weak demand for computers in the low and middle tier may prove bad news for shareholders of HP. Around one-quarter of HP's revenue is from the Personal Systems unit. There is hope for shareholders. The roll-out of high-end laptops like the Spectre x360 or EliteBook 1020 should find success. Unfortunately, HP is concentrating on the low-end units in places like China for market share growth. As economic growth slows in China, HP will face increasing challenges in that market. Revenue from HP's networking division fell last quarter, hurt by weak performance in China. In the printer market, HP may still face excess inventory issues. This segment accounted for nearly half of the company's revenue in the second quarter. At that time, the company said its supply channel inventory was higher than expected. It did not expect to lower channel inventory levels until the second half of this year. Investors should consider avoiding holding shares of HP ahead of quarterly earnings. At best, the company may forecast higher cost savings thanks to its plans for splitting the company. At worst, the company will report even weaker than expected sales from the PC division. This will mean new lows for the stock. Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.
