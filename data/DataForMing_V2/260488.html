With Target And Wal-Mart Website Problems, Bad News Is Good News - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) | Seeking Alpha One of the key focuses of Wal-Mart's (NYSE: WMT ) revitalization effort is to increase its online relevance. That's no different than what most brick and mortar stores are looking to do, including direct competitors like Target (NYSE: TGT ). So it's easy to read the news headlines of website troubles on cyber Monday as a bad sign, but it probably isn't as bad as the media would have you believe. In fact, it's more appropriate to see the trouble as growing pains. There's no question that shopping habits continue to change. A big part of that has been the Internet, a relatively new shopping alternative which has seen impressive sales growth. Note, however, that not too long ago the Internet didn't exist as a shopping alternative at all, so the growth has been off of a low base. At some point the law of large numbers will take over and growth will slow. But here and now, the Internet is an increasingly important sales channel. Unfortunately many retailers were slow to catch on to the looming importance. Which is exactly why retail giants like Wal-Mart and Target are playing catch up to Internet behemoth Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) -- a company that was little more than a startup at the turn of the century. But, with early and heavy spending, Amazon is the go-to online retailer for many people. It is one of the few ubiquitous Internet-only retail "stores" on the web. It's going to be hard for Wal-Mart and Target to catch up to that. But that's a far cry from saying they can't or that they won't create very respectable online businesses while they try. (It's worth noting that Amazon recently opened a physical store , proving that there just might be life beyond the Internet.) And don't forget that while Amazon has created a very valuable business, profitability has sometimes been a touch and go issue because of the nearly constant growth spending to stay ahead of a long-list of diverse Internet trends (retail is just one piece of the puzzle at Amazon). The company's valuation is built largely on the promise of what it's business can do, not on what it has delivered. For example, it's P/E is nearly 1,000 right now. Wal-Mart and Target are companies that have decades of success behind them and long rewarded shareholders with such mundane things as annual dividend increases. So when Target's site puts up a screen that asks customers to hold on while it deals with too much customer traffic and Wal-Mart's site leaves customers unable to complete sales, it may not be as bad as it seems. Yes, these two companies likely lost out on cyber Monday sales. But so did a whole host of budding online players. The list reportedly includes Victoria's Secret, Foot Locker (NYSE: FL ), and Neiman Marcus. Even online payment service PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL ) was noted to have stumbled on high demand. So Wal-Mart and Target aren't the only ones who didn't do as well as they might have hoped service wise. They are just two eye catching names that the media like to throw into headlines and push across the lips of their talking heads. But here's the positive spin. Target and Wal-Mart have been making a concerted effort to increase their online presence. So they geared up for cyber Monday, pushing their sales hard in an attempt to draw a "crowd." They succeeded. In fact, they did such a good job that they're online sites were overloaded with customers. Should Wal-Mart and Target, along with many others, have been better prepared? Perhaps. But that doesn't mean that their online efforts were failures. Far from it, they succeeded beyond expectations. That proves that even old brick and mortar stores can be relevant online. Which is essentially what Wal-Mart has been saying throughout its catch up effort. While I have my own concerns about Wal-Mart's ability to handle all of the changes it's set out to accomplish (the Internet is just one part of a bigger makeover), I'm not suggesting Wal-Mart is wrong about the online prospects for major retailers like itself. Both Wal-Mart and Target have massive distribution networks, a physical presence for customers, economies of scale, and, perhaps more important, existing relationships with customers off of which to build. These are very real benefits that can be used to grow an online business. But Wal-Mart and Target are both giant ships that are slow to turn. They are starting the process in earnest now. Receiving so much online traffic that they had trouble handling the load is a good sign that their efforts are taking hold. So when I see Amazon.com running smoothly through cyber Monday I don't think anything about it. The online retailer has had years of experience. When I see Wal-Mart and Target stumbling on the day, I first think it's bad. But then I remember that they stumbled because they got more traffic then they expected and that's good news for a pair of retailers trying to jump start their Internet businesses. And, when you look more closely at the stocks, I'd rather own Wal-Mart trading at a trailing P/E of around 13 or Target with a trailing P/E of 16 than Amazon and it's P/E of nearly 1,000. Will it be hard for Target and Wal-Mart to become Internet giants? Yes. Is it impossible? No. And even if they never unseat Amazon, they don't need to. They simply need to keep growing their online businesses so they can keep their existing customers in the fold, online and off. This is, of course, just one aspect of Wal-Mart and Target. There's a lot more to know about each company. That said, you'll want to keep a close eye on what's going on online because it is increasingly important for each of these retailers. But don't get too caught up in the headlines, because all "bad news" isn't bad. This is one time when bad news is probably good news.
