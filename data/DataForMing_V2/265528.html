Why Apple Is Stuck In Purgatory - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha With Morgan Stanley projecting iPhone sales to drop for the first time ever in 2016, is Apple's bread and butter in trouble? The death of cell phone contracts and product line diversification are two catalysts that can drive Apple up or down. With a PE that mirrors the industry average, Apple is one of the most efficiently priced stocks on the market. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is not about the products they make, it's about what the brand stands for. They've branded themselves into a luxury consumer electronics company. It's the reason consumers will pay a premium for an Apple product and therefore shoot up their gross profit margin. The closest example I can think of to this is Sony (NYSE: SNE ). I remember back in the day when if you didn't have a Sony TV then you couldn't have had a high-end entertainment set-up. Apple has a similar branding strategy where their products are the luxury line of electronics. With a lot of current speculation about Apple seeing their first decline in iPhone sales coming in 2016, a lot of eyes will be on their growth and whether or not they can sustain their dominant growth rate. With more than 60% of Apple's revenue coming from iPhone sales, the death of the cell phone contract may be threatening Apple's bread and butter. Cell phone carriers have been playing around with prepaid month-to-month phone service for a long time, but now they are taking that concept mainstream. When T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS ), then AT&T (NYSE: T ), and then Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) announced they were moving away from contracts and toward month-to-month service it was probably a surprise to both customers and phone manufacturers. Now cell phone carriers are still able to break down the ridiculous cell phone prices into monthly installments, so you don't have to shell out several hundred dollars upfront for a smartphone. Some people think this will hurt Apple because consumers will be more exposed to the true cost of an iPhone. Personally, I disagree. However, I do believe it will have a negative impact on iPhone sales because of the following 2 reasons: Elimination of cell phone contracts actually creates a stronger market for unlocked phones. Basically if you pick up a plan with Verizon and roll your iPhone purchase into monthly installments with your plan then you're really not as conscious of the price you are paying for the phone. But what if you want to cancel your service and move to another cell phone carrier? Then all that money is due upfront for the phone, therefore you are still on the hook with the cell phone carrier. The solution? Purchasing cell phones from retailers at monthly installments. There will be a need for this and I think we will see demand skyrocket for it, so that consumers are paying a monthly bill to cell phone carriers and a monthly bill to retailers for their phone, eliminating the threat of paying a huge sum upfront for it. The downside to Apple? People will have to knowingly choose a higher monthly bill for the iPhone without any way to sugarcoat it. The barrier of entry into the cell phone industry will drop significantly. This is the biggest threat to not just Apple, but all big smartphone manufacturers. Not purchasing your phone from a cell phone carrier means players like OnePlus and more unknown manufacturers can gain more traction amongst consumers. If people start shopping for cell phones at retailers separate of their plan, then it's likely the cell phone market will become more competitive, and as cell phone technology makes smaller strides and phones become cheaper to make, prices will drop and margins will become significantly reduced. Apple knows they can't remain the world's most valuable company with their entire pulse on iPhone sales, especially with Morgan Stanley projecting Apple's first decline in iPhone sales coming in 2016. With a strong brand they have the ability to slap their name on other consumer electronics and create a buzz amongst their loyal customer base. And Apple knows how to play their brand - just look at some of the high-end Apple Watches which go beyond $10,000, which reinforces Apple as a luxury consumer electronics company. Apple TV is another new stream for revenue. So while iPhone and tablet sales should slow in the future, Apple has the luxury of being able to capitalize on existing technologies by slapping their name on them. While this strategy is not sustainable in the long term, it could be enough to make up for potential declines in future iPhone sales until they are either able to come out with a new groundbreaking product, aka the iPod, or are able to at least show they can diversify their revenue more. Most of the time when I hear about Apple being undervalued their low price-to-earnings ratio always comes up. However, Apple's PE ratio isn't really that low, yet it's also really not high. Apple's TTM PE of 12.3 perfectly mirrors the consumer and electronics industry average. But shouldn't Apple trade at a higher PE than the industry average? Not really. As the most valuable company in the group, Apple faces a much harder time trying to grow their earnings compared to the pack. Apple's three-year net income growth rate is almost 2.4X below the industry average. But how is that possible if Apple's return on equity is 41% higher than the industry average? Because Apple's net income growth trails the industry they have been trying to keep a high ROE. By doing so, Apple has increased debt to more than $53 billion. While this debt is far from a burden for Apple, it is equal to 33% of their long-term investments, and that percentage has been climbing rapidly over the last few years. So while Apple is growing sales significantly faster than the industry, that doesn't mean they should have a higher PE than the industry. Revenue growth might be 91% higher, but price-to-sales and price-to-book are 47% and 36% higher than the industry average. What this all says to me is that Apple's PE ratio is a fair one. Apple is not a company I typically follow. However I have to hear about them all the time because they dominate the investment media. With so much analyst coverage, volume, and crowdsourced research, Apple is most likely one of the most efficiently-valued stocks on the market. There is a large investor base that believes Apple is trading at a steep discount due to their high growth rate and net margins, however that doesn't tell the full story. They still struggle with earnings growth and an inability to diversify their sales. I feel Apple is one of the stocks that the market has valued appropriately and I don't think they are going to move toward heaven or hell over the next 12 months, but rather remain in purgatory.
