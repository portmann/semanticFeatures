Verizon: One Dow Dog That's Fallen Too Far - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha China Slowdown and Downturn in Oil are leading the market lower. Investors should expect most Dow Components would be dragged lower by one or both of these trends. One exception should be Verizon with a largely domestic revenue stream and little energy exposure yet shares are down in line with the Dow, leaving Verizon undervalued. VZ Earnings Estimates have risen as the stock has fallen 10% leaving shares trading at 2/3 of the market forward price to earnings ratio. The market continues to knocked around like a pi√±ata and the two issues swinging the stick are China and Oil Prices. Its no secret that a number of multinationals have jumped on the China bandwagon reaping the benefits of the fastest growing large economy on the globe. With China's market swooning downwards on a daily basis there is little doubt revenue and profits from such companies as Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and General Motors (NYSE: GM ) and many others will be impacted. Exacerbating market volatility has been the pronounced downtrend in the oil patch causing significant earnings retraction among the critical energy sector. Do an extent the two themes are related as demand slows from the worlds second largest economy. The impact of the two is a significant downward move in the overall market including the mega cap Dow Jones Industrial Average. Given the Dow components exposure to the energy, Chevron (NYSE: CVX ) and Exxon (NYSE: XOM ) and multinational companies with exposure to China one would expect most names be trading downward. What we find interesting is there is one name, Verizon (NYSE: VZ ), that really has no meaningful exposure to either yet is down significantly over the last several months in line with the Dow (NYSEARCA: DIA ) Yet when we look at Verizon on an earnings basis we see that all numbers are trending in an upwards direction. In the last 30 days four analysts covering the stock have lifted estimates for both the current year and FY 2016. The current years mean estimate is up 10 cents per share over the last ninety days. In the same period VZ shares have lost nearly 10%. The decline in VZ shares combine with the upward move in earnings estimates leaves them trading at just 11 times forward earnings, according to Yahoo Finance. By comparison the S&P 500 trades at an estimated 17 times forward earnings according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Its been said that rising tides can lift all boats and in the case of VZ it seems the opposite is holding true. Despite the downward trajectory of VZ shares analysts have remained bullish on earnings leaving VZ with a forward price to earnings ratio that is just 2/3 of the overall market. Investors would be wise to pick up shares of VZ given the discount the falling tide has provided. Disclosure: I am/we are long VZ, XOM, CVX, AAPL, GM.
