Apple Needs To Showcase Gaming At WWDC 2015 - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha The WWDC is one of Apple's bigger events, but sometimes I wonder if what they present is really relevant to application developers. Gaming revenue comprises the bulk of Apple's app store revenue. So, what's most important for shareholders and developers is whether Apple has developed further capabilities in mobile gaming. Hopefully, Apple adds additional features for mobile gamers, because that's what will stimulate demand for the upcoming iPad (enterprise apps won't meaningfully impact demand, or software revenue). Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) upcoming presentation at WWDC on June 8th 2015 will be huge. It's the "Tomorrowland" for app developers, and the broader tech community. This year, the table stakes are expected to reach unprecedented heights, as Apple needs to prove that it's the most financially viable platform for app developers. A whole economy is built around mobile devices, so at this point; Apple needs to demonstrate why it's a viable business partner to the hundreds of thousand app developers that earn a living from designing mobile apps. So, while tech journalists will be busy weighing the pros and cons of each feature addition, the app developers will be working overtime to integrate the new iOS 9 features into various apps, prior to the launch of iPhone 6S. Hopefully, Apple comes up with enough incremental improvements to iOS, to lift the expectations of shareholders, and developers. Currently, Android and iOS each represent 45% of the total revenue generated by apps in 2015. The even split implies that iOS is still holding its ground despite having a smaller installed base of users. I anticipate that app developers will generate $35 billion in revenue from app revenue on iOS by 2017. This assumes that the total revenue from apps reaches $77 billion, as indicated by Gartner, and Apple maintains 45% revenue share of the app economy. Games currently represent 75% of Apple app store revenue. I anticipate Apple's software and service revenue to reach $19.6 billion in FY 2015. Software and services has historically grown at a low teen rate. Therefore, if app store revenue continues to grow at the fast pace that Gartner forecasts, the business could eventually reach $50B a year (inclusive of services) by 2020. Therefore, the most important insight for shareholders at WWDC is gaming. How will Apple improve the gaming experience for gamers? Will there be a new software developer kit for mobile game developers, or various features that improve the power and performance for games designed for iOS? That's what's important, as it's the quickest solution to getting gamers back onboard with the latest in Apple gadgetry. Everyone looks at the iPad like it's going to become the reigning king of productivity in the enterprise. It will replace the PC, and replace various other devices and pre-existing enterprise software platforms/ecosystems (please interpret this as sarcasm). That was the bullish reasoning for why the iPad will somehow reverse course after years of sluggish growth. Somehow IBM was going to save the day (more sarcasm). This upcoming year, the iPad Air 3 isn't going to be that much better from the context of hardware, size, or design. Therefore, Apple has to go back to its roots as a consumer facing franchise. This can be accomplished by making the iPad the most relevant device for gaming -- period. It has the largest installed base of tablet users in the world, and the A8X is by far the most powerful CPU/GPU for gaming in its respective category. Therefore, Apple either needs to develop a separate event for mobile games, or showcase its various updates pertaining to mobile gaming, then focus on everything else. The iPad Air 2 is the most powerful mobile gaming device on earth (especially in its price category). It also has the largest ecosystem of game developers. So, if Apple really wants to keep the iPad relevant in the eyes of consumers, it has to encourage app developers to create better games with more visually stunning effects. Apple needs to show mobile game developers an easy pathway to making and monetizing higher quality games. Sure, the industry looks to these events as a trend-setting indicator for where tech will be in five to ten years. But trend-setting aside, I'd argue that gaming is starting to become the key differentiator that could separate iOS from the rest of the pack. After all, if all the best games are on iOS and work the best on iOS, why buy an Android phone or tablet?
