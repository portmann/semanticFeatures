Boeing: A Different Look At The Dreamliner Costs - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Amortized tooling costs shifts ahead break-even point. Boeing could eventually recoup all costs according to calculations, but it will be a challenge. In one of my previous articles I had a look at the deferred costs on the Boeing (NYSE: BA ) 787 program and concluded that Boeing is currently losing $15.6 mln per airframe, but that I do expect Boeing to break-even in within 1100 deliveries. A reader, however, pointed out that I did not include the amortized tooling costs which adds another $4 bn to the total costs. In this article I will add the amortized tooling costs and I will also have a look at the financial prospect when the development costs are added to the equation. What has to be noted is that amortized tooling does not impact the cost per aircraft, since the tooling costs have been more or less stable in comparison to the deferred costs. However, adding amortized tooling costs does shift the break-even point ahead. Figure 2: Costs on the Boeing 787 Program (Source: AeroAnalysis.net ) As can be seen in Figure 2 total costs (excluding development costs) are $32.2 bn, almost $4 bn higher than the deferred costs. If Boeing were to recoup the costs for amortized tooling and deferred costs with its current backlog it needs to make an average profit of $46.9 mln on the coming 700 airframes that will be delivered. Applying a 35% profit margin I estimated Boeing's profit (in a best case scenario) to be $47 mln. Given the fact that Boeing has to ramp up profit per production, the same way it had to cut costs it can be ruled out that Boeing can recoup the costs with its current backlog. Boeing used an accounting block of 1300 aircraft, that means that the jet maker can estimate the production costs of these 1300 airframes quite accurately. If we apply the accounting block of 1300 aircraft to the total costs, Boeing needs to make a $35.5 mln profit per airframe on average. This figure seems to be more achievable to me. Adding development costs is not something a jet maker would normally do, some programs would never draw profit if development costs were added to the program costs. To have a view on the prospect for the Boeing 787 on the longer term it is interesting to add development costs anyways. I estimated/guesstimated the development costs to be $20 bn. In this case I will not spread out the costs over the accounting block of 1300 aircraft, but over the total units that Boeing can sell if it captures half of the market. This figure would be little over 4100 aircraft, if we reduce this number by the number of Dreamliners Boeing needs to recoup the deferred and amortized costs, we are left with 3180 airframes. This means that Boeing needs about $6.3 million on average to recover its development costs. Breaking-even on deferred and amortization costs within the accounting block is a major challenge and depends on how fast Boeing can ramp up profits Adding development costs means that on average $6.3 million needs to be recovered per airframe after Boeing has covered the deferred costs. This should be more than doable for Boeing. All in all, there is still a lot of work for Boeing to be done, but the long-term outlook remains bright… even if Boeing has to recoup for the billions in developments costs on the Boeing 787.
