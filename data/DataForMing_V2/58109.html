Verizon: Is AOL Worth The Cash? - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha Verizon agreed to purchase AOL for $4.4 billion in cash. The deal adds debt to an already large debt load. AOL doesn't appear to add the exciting assets suggested by the press release with the company offering limited growth. At this point, any deal adding debt isn't appealing, but the materiality of the deal doesn't adjust a breakout forecast for Verizon's stock. The validity of Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ ) purchasing AOL (NYSE: AOL ) is very much a debate, but the one part missing from those discussions is the use of cash for the deal. One of the biggest concerns with an investment in Verizon is the debt load created from the transaction with Vodafone (NASDAQ: VOD ). The basis of the AOL deal is better sculpted on whether it is worth the cash. Verizon agreed to buy AOL for $50 per share or roughly $4.4 billion. AOL is forecast to reach about $2.7 billion in revenue this year and generates a decent profit. Analysts peg the deal worth roughly 7.5x EBITDA estimates for the year. On that basis, the deal can be argued based on the merits of owning the content assets (assuming it doesn't dump Huffington Post prior to the merger) or if the programmatic-ad business is an ideal fit in Verizon. The issue though is that it agreed to pay all cash for the deal. At the end of Q1, Verizon had nearly $109 billion in net debt. The company only promises reaching the credit ratings prior to the Vodafone deal for Verizon Wireless by the 2018/2019 timeline. Nobody appears excited to own AOL based on the chart showing no action in the stock for the last two years. AOL traded at a market EPS multiple and is forecast to show an EPS dip in 2015. The prospects for 2016 aren't that much better as analyst estimates have declined in the last 90 days from $2.54 to $2.34 per share. Ultimately, the deal doesn't matter if it wasn't for the cash spent. Verizon expects revenue of $131.1 billion making AOL equivalent to roughly 2% of revenue. The potential in the online video ad business that AOL has built up is intriguing, but it is difficult to see how it is worth $4.4 billion with the other opportunities in the market. Most importantly, why is Verizon taking on more debt to complete the deal instead of issuing stock. The previous research had suggested that Verizon was set for a breakout (see article ). This news though questions that theory. No matter how anybody spins the excitement over the OTT aspirations, original content, and programmatic advertising platform, analysts only forecast revenue growing 5.4% in 2016 with EPS virtually flat with 2014 levels. AOL continues to just churn with no real distinguishable assets and Verizon doesn't need to add any further debt to the balance sheet. Verizon still appears set for a breakout based on the improved margins from the domestic wireless business, but this transaction doesn't help at all. Source: Verizon: Is AOL Worth The Cash?
