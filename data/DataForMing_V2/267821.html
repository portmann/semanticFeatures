Apple: Why This Isn't 'Peak iPhone' - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha A Morgan Stanley analyst has predicted that Apple will suffer a y/y decline in iPhone sales in its fiscal 2016. Some believe that we've seen 'Peak iPhone' in fiscal 2015 and that iPhone sales will now go into decline. Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty shook the Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) investor community when word spread Monday of her prediction that iPhone unit sales would fall by 5.7% to 218 million. This would mark the first ever decline in annual sales, since it was introduced in 2007. Combined with a 10% downward revision for the December quarter revenue outlook from Dialog Semiconductor (DLG), an Apple supplier, the news weighed heavily on the stock, which is back down around $111 as of Wednesday December 16. Is this indeed "Peak iPhone"? I don't think so. As reported by Philip Elmer-Dewitt, Huberty softened the blow a little in a conference call which laid out the reasoning for the prediction. Supply chain surveys indicated component orders for the December quarter down by 10%, and down 20% for the March quarter. But Huberty characterized the supply chain data as a "worst-case scenario." I have a great deal of respect for Ms. Huberty, and I was surprised to hear her base predictions on supply chain data. This, like the many analyst estimates of iPhone manufacturing costs, has been thoroughly repudiated by Apple CEO Tim Cook. It was at the fiscal 2013 Q1 conference call in January 2013 that Cook advised analysts not to rely on supply chain rumors: . . . even if a particular data point were factual it would be impossible to accurately interpret the data point as to what it meant for our overall business because the supply chain is very complex and we obviously have multiple sources for things, yields might vary, supply performance can vary. The beginning inventory positions can vary. . . Daniel Eran Dilger immediately leaped on this point in a lengthy response to the Huberty prediction. He provides recent history of the many times that supply chain data has been the basis of inaccurate predictions of iPhone sales. Piper Jaffray's Gene Munster subsequently chimed in : Apple has previously said, and we would agree, that individual component suppliers are not indicative of the health of the overall iPhone business. Opinion is all it can be at this point, folks. Huberty is projecting an entire fiscal year 2016 sales on the basis of a quarter's worth of supply chain visibility. Even if the supply chain data is accurate, there isn't an Apple supplier who has more than a quarter of visibility, because that's all Apple ever provides. For second tier suppliers such as Dialog, the visibility is even less, more like 30 days. Companies like Dialog get their orders on more or less a PO basis, from Apple's first tier suppliers, not even from Apple itself. How does one extrapolate this level of visibility into a specific full year prediction of iPhone unit sales? That does seem a stretch. Especially considering that Apple's outstanding fiscal 2015 financial performance does not suggest a company that is losing momentum. In the chart below I summarize the percent change in some key metrics for Apple since a baseline in fiscal 2010. The initial conditions as of the end of fiscal 2010 were: The gap between the stock price growth and Apple's operating income growth is about as great as at the end of fiscal 2013, when Apple did provide some objective basis for negative investor sentiment in the form of its operating income y/y decline. But there's been no such decline in 2015, and revenue and operating income growth accelerated. I believe this chart shows in an objective way the impact of the negative media coverage which has hounded Apple this year. In many ways, the current crisis of confidence mirrors what occurred in August, when the negative narrative was focused on the impact of an economic slowdown in China. Only now the narrative has shifted away from China to Peak iPhone, and the seemingly impossible task of surmounting last fiscal year's impressive iPhone sales. We're seeing a pattern where the narrative never becomes positive in response to a particular negative pretext being disproved. The narrative simply moves on to the next negative pretext. Unlike Dilger, I don't think it's enough to offer investors a diatribe on media bias. For one thing, the media bias is pretty obvious to long-term Apple investors and doesn't need to be belabored. In the vein of being data-driven, I think there are some important long-term indicators that show where Apple is headed in fiscal 2016. Let's focus on China. China was the Great Bogeyman of mid summer, with some justification. China is Apple's growth engine, and continues to be, as Apple's fiscal Q4 results demonstrated. While most other geographic regions grew revenue y/y by 2-10%, China grew by 99%. There are a number of leading economic indicators that investors can look at. There is the Shanghai composite that initiated all the fear and loathing back in August. Many people consider the Chinese government an unreliable source of economic information, so let's next look at an index compiled by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The OECD Composite Leading Indicator shows an uptick after the summer decline: The Caixin Manufacturing PMI showed considerable improvement after summer, although it's still below 50, indicating that manufacturing is still contracting: Overall, the economic data points to a Chinese economy that is stable, and probably on the mend. Since Apple didn't suffer meaningfully from a decline in China revenue even during the worst of the economic scare in calendar Q3, I believe that it's safe to say that China continues to present a growth opportunity for Apple. Apple has by no means saturated the Chinese smartphone market. That market is turning to Apple as the premium upgrade option, and I expect the Chinese market to continue to do so. Of course, there are always competitive threats to iPhone. Apple's competitors will field new devices in the coming quarters, and Apple will field it's next generation iPhone in the September 2016 time frame. This is an ongoing competitive cycle that sees iPhone market share typically decline in the calendar first and second quarters. I expect the cyclical nature of iPhone sales to continue. I expect iPhone sales for fiscal 2016 to post y/y growth, especially as a result of the all-new iPhone 7 to be introduced next fall. I expect Apple to maintain its lead in hardware and processor design, as well as mobile operating systems. The source of Apple's growth is fundamentally its technical leadership. Not brand image, not coolness, or any other ephemeral property. I continue to regard Apple as a buy, especially when a lack of confidence depresses the stock price.
