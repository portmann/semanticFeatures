Alibaba May Keep Falling, But Its Stock Is Too Good To Pass Up - Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) | Seeking Alpha BABA reminds me a lot of FB shortly after its IPO. The company is growing fast and trades at a valuation that does not reflect its growth nor its investments. Thanks to a collapse in Chinese stock prices, BABA's stock is a long-term gift, even if it is a short-term nightmare. Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) has lost more than 35% of its valuation this year, and now sits nearly 45% off its post-IPO high. Granted, Alibaba likely needed to give up some gains from its all-time high stock price late last year, but still, its degree of losses have been rather excessive. So while continued selling pressure in China's equity markets and fears of an economic slowdown might keep Alibaba shares low, and perhaps push it even lower, long-term there aren't many opportunities that are better. Chinese regulators are doing everything in their power to stop the bleeding in its equity markets. This includes a recent rate cut , restrictions on trading, and devaluing its currency in an attempt to boost economic growth. Yet still, the Shanghai Composite Index is currently 42% off its high, creating just about all of those losses during the last three months. This performance is very similar to that of Alibaba, one of China's largest companies. As a result, investors can confirm that a large percentage of Alibaba's recent loss is macro and market-related, not fundamentally created. Earlier this month Alibaba announced what I consider to be very strong earnings, with very few question marks. Specifically, I didn't consider Alibaba's gross merchandise volume (GMV) growth to be a problem, unlike many Wall Street analysts. This is a company that had GMV of $109 billion! With it being so high, it is unrealistic to expect 50% growth every quarter. Personally, I was happy with its 36% GMV growth excluding the effects of its lost lottery business. Furthermore, I liked that its mobile GMV increased 125% year-over-year and now accounts for well over half of total GMV with $60 billion during the last quarter. With that said, if you are unfamiliar with Alibaba's business model, it does not report revenue from GMV, but rather advertising and marketing. In other words, Alibaba monetizes its GMV by selling ads and marketing a designer's store/products. Albeit, with $109 billion of GMV, and fast growth, Alibaba has a great opportunity to monetize its business long-term much like advertisers whose average revenue per user increases. In Alibaba's last quarter, its monetization or take rate of GMV sat at just 2.33%, a figure that I consider very low, one with the potential for significant upside as the company shifts its focus from total GMV growth to improving monetization methods. Specifically, we saw Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) do the same thing a few years back as it became harder to grow monthly active users. Like Facebook, the key with Alibaba is that it has an enormous network to monetize, and that bodes well for the company. All things considered, the Facebook comparison to Alibaba is interesting to me, because Alibaba reminds me a lot of Facebook shortly after its IPO. While it may be hard to remember, there were many people placing big bets against Facebook south of $30 per share. I saw the value in Facebook, buying it at $22.50 per share, and publicly criticizing Barron's when it later said that Facebook shares would fall to $15 per share in a cover story. Among the reasons that bears like Barron's were expecting Facebook shares to reach such a low level included the company's struggle to monetize mobile, its limited MAU upside growth, and last but not least a forward P/E ratio of 36 (at the time). Looking back, those questions were answered, and I expect Alibaba to do the same. Specifically, investors are concerned with Alibaba's GMV upside, its monetization of GMV, and even after losing nearly half of its valuation, there are some who still say Alibaba is too expensive. However, Alibaba is a company that is expected to grow revenue 26% this year and then 31% next year, and trades at just 20 times next year's expected earnings, which is considerably lower than Facebook's forward P/E ratio back when everyone was screaming to sell or avoid it. So while I still believe the markets could get worse before getting better, I think that based on these things alone, Alibaba is a company whose stock will trade significantly higher in the years to come, perhaps following in the footsteps of Facebook. On top of these noted things, which I believe are more than enough reasons to invest in Alibaba, there is a wildcard. That wildcard is Alibaba's emphasis on making investments all around the world and a large cash pile in a high margin business that will allow it to continue doing so. Alibaba does not just invest in infrastructure for its core e-commerce business, but also has large, controlling stakes in worldwide education platforms, high-end apparel and brick and mortar retail, messaging apps, online taxi services, online video content and streaming, daily deals, logistics, and a sports team. The internet browser UCWeb is one of Alibaba's more infamous investments, but others include Youku (NYSE: YOKU ), ChinaVision, InTime Retail, etc. The key here is that Alibaba has essentially become a leading financial institution, owning Alipay, hedge fund, private equity firm, angel investor, etc., all camouflaged as a leading online retailer. This is a company that has its hand in everything, all around the world, large and small companies, and many speculative assets that might one day become the next Xiaomi, Uber, Twitter, or Alibaba. Hence, Alibaba's past investments might one day drive stock gains, and given the fact that Alibaba has upwards of $17 billion in cash & equivalents and $6.7 billion of free cash flow during the last year, chances are those investments won't stop. Therefore, with a market capitalization of $160 billion, Alibaba may look expensive, but when you consider its growth, profits, investments, and the opportunity created by all its many assets, Alibaba looks like a no-brainer.
