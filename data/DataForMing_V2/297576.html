ETF Hub Jan 22 2016, 04:17 ET | About: Apple Inc. (AAPL) | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is no longer the world's largest public company, when defined by enterprise value , which includes debt and subtracts cash to give a more complete picture of a firm's worth. Alphabet overtook Apple in December and is now valued at $420B compared with the latter's $393B. Measured by market cap, Apple still remains bigger, at $535B versus the search giant's $485B. Separately, Tim Cook made a surprise visit to Brussels yesterday, looking to lobby European Commissioner Margrethe Vestager as EU regulators close in on a final decision about the company's Irish tax deals. "enterprise value, which includes debt and subtracts cash".  Yes, Apple's $150 Billion cash in the bank net of debt is considered by some to be a real ding. And more debt would certainly be better, right? At least 5% of apples net cash will go up-in-smoke if there is a negative EU tax ruling next month. Hmmm. So subtracting a company's cash gives a more complete picture of its status? I think that could be argued the other way... Why did SA allow its release?  What is the point other than to mislead investors and indulge in Anti-Apple rhetoric. Get a life.
