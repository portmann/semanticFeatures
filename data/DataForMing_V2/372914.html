Preparing For A Drop In Microsoft Stock - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft has been on a roll recently, showing promise in its tablet computers and cloud infrastructure services business. A couple of recent warnings highlighted market risk though. Notes this week by Goldman Sachs and Evercore ISI caution that the recent market rally may be running out of steam. Evercore even advised selling stocks and buying gold. For Microsoft longs looking to limit their risk, we present two ways of hedging the stock over the next several months. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) seems to be doing better than Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) in some ways recently. Unlike Apple, it hasn't made Donald Trump's corporate hit list (yet). And as Matt Weinberger at Business Insider reported recently ("Microsoft is beating Apple in a key battle for the future of computing"), Microsoft's Surface detachable-keyboard tablet (pictured below; image via Business Insider) is projected to steal market share from Apple's iPad Pro, according to research by the International Data Corporation ((Pending: IDC )). Plus, as Seeking Alpha contributor Tradevestor pointed out recently ( Microsoft Stock: It Has It All ), Microsoft has a huge growth opportunity ahead of it in cloud infrastructure services. So why look at adding downside protection to Microsoft now? One reason to consider it is concern about the broader stock market, as exemplified by recent warning notes by Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS ) and Evercore ISI. On Thursday, Seeking Alpha CEO and news editor Eli Hoffman excerpted both notes. Goldman's note ("The recent relief rally may be short-lived") cautioned that the market's recovery rally had been "too fast," and the engine they saw driving it, the oil market recovery, might be about to stall. Evercore ISI's warning was more bearish ("Sell stocks and buy gold"), as the firm abandoned its upside target on the S&P 500 in light of reversals in technical indicators. If you share Evercore's view, you may have already sold your Microsoft shares and bought gold (in which case, you might want to read about Hedging Your Bets On Gold ). If, on the other hand, you're still generally bullish about the market and Microsoft, but want to limit your downside risk in the event you're wrong, hedging might make sense for you. So we'll look at a couple of different ways of hedging Microsoft below. If you'd like a refresher on hedging terms first, please see the section titled "Refresher On Hedging Terms" in our article on hedging Realty Income (NYSE: O ). We're going to use Portfolio Armor's iOS app to find optimal puts and an optimal collar to hedge MSFT below, but you don't need the app for this. You can find optimal puts and collars yourself by using the process we outlined in this article if you're willing to take the time and do the math. Whether you run the calculations yourself using the process we outlined or use the app, one additional piece of information you'll need to supply (along with the number of shares you're looking to hedge) when scanning for an optimal put is your "threshold," which refers to the maximum decline you are willing to risk. This will vary depending on your risk tolerance. For the purpose of the examples below, we've used a threshold of 14%. Often, we'd write that if you are more risk-averse, you could use a smaller threshold, but, in this case, it was too expensive to hedge MSFT against a smaller threshold over the next several months with optimal puts. But if you are less risk-averse, you could have used a larger one. All else equal, though, the higher the threshold, the cheaper it will be to hedge. Here are the optimal puts, as of Thursday's close, to hedge 500 shares of MSFT against a greater than 14% drop by late October. As you can see at the bottom of the screen capture above, the cost of this protection was $1,420, or 5.46% of position value. A couple of points about this cost: To be conservative, the cost was based on the ask price of the puts. In practice, you can often buy puts for less (at some price between the bid and ask). The 14% threshold includes the hedging cost so that, in the worst-case scenario, your MSFT position would be down 8.54%, not including the hedging cost. When scanning for an optimal collar, you'll need one more figure in addition to your threshold: your "cap," which refers to the maximum upside you are willing to limit yourself to if the underlying security appreciates significantly. A logical starting point for the cap is your estimate of how the security will perform over the time period of the hedge. For example, if you're hedging over a several-month period, and you think a security won't appreciate more than 8% over that time frame, then it might make sense to use 8% as a cap. You don't think the security is going to do better than that anyway, so you're willing to sell someone else the right to call it away if it does better than that. Since Microsoft passed our two screens to avoid bad investments , we were able to get a potential return estimate for it from the Portfolio Armor website . The site's potential return for it was 10%, so we'll use that as the cap on our collar below. As of Thursday's close, this was the optimal collar to hedge 500 shares of MSFT against a greater than 14% drop by late October, while not capping an investor's upside at less than 10%. You might have noticed that the strike price of the put leg of this collar is different from the strike of the optimal put above, despite both hedges having the same threshold. That's enabled by the net hedging cost of this optimal collar being significantly lower than the cost of the optimal put hedge. As you can see in the first part of the optimal collar above, the cost of the put leg was $970, or 3.73%, as a percentage of position value. But if you look at the second part of the collar below, you'll see the income generated by selling the call leg was $885, or 3.4% of position value. So, the net cost of this optimal collar was $85, or 0.33% of position value. One note on this collar hedge: Similar to the situation with the optimal put, to be conservative, the cost of the optimal collar was calculated using the ask price of the puts and the bid price of the calls. In practice, an investor can often buy puts for less and sell calls for more (again, at some price between the bid and the ask), so in reality, an investor would likely have paid less than $85 when opening this collar.
