ETF Hub YHOO's first quarter earnings were about as expected, nothing exciting with no major improvements. What is exciting is that the date for SpinCo is fast-approaching, and Yahoo disclosed that it's exploring options for Yahoo Japan. With $6.9 billion in cash, combined with the value of its Alibaba and Yahoo Japan stakes, it's becoming evident that Yahoo is a very rare investment opportunity. The closer I look at Yahoo!'s (NASDAQ: YHOO ) fundamentals, assets and future divestments, the more apparent its unprecedented value becomes. Yes, its display advertisements remain under pressure, and Marissa Mayer has been unable to return Yahoo to revenue growth, but in reality none of that matters. The reason is because Yahoo's existing $4.6 billion-a-year business has been deemed less than worthless, which is why the opportunity is so great. Yahoo's Alibaba stake is currently worth $33.50 a share. If SpinCo were established today, Yahoo would be trading at $11 a share with a market capitalization of $10.3 billion. The bear case against Yahoo is that $10.3 billion is too expensive for the company's core business, valuing it at over 40x operating income. The problem for bears trying to make this case is that Yahoo is playing all its cards right to maximize shareholder value, and currently there is no value built into Yahoo's stock for the company's core business. At the end of Yahoo's first quarter the company had a cash balance of $6.9 billion and Mayer disclosed on the conference call that Yahoo is exploring options for its 35.5% stake in Yahoo Japan. This statement can be translated to say that Yahoo is trying to figure the best way to divest the asset. Who knows, it may do another spinoff, and with the stake worth $8.8 billion, that move would leave Yahoo's core business with a valuation of just $1.5 billion. Granted, Yahoo is unlikely to divest Yahoo Japan via spinoff or asset sale until after Alibaba is spun off, tackling one issue at a time. However, if in fact Yahoo sells or spins off its Japan stake then what's left of Yahoo would be essentially nothing, or less than nothing. In 10 years of investing I don't believe I have ever seen a company that could realistically be valued at less than its cash position. With Yahoo, it could actually be in a scenario where it has more than $4.5 in cash for every $1 in market capitalization. Furthermore, Yahoo has $2.5 billion left on its current buyback plan, and if the company waits until SpinCo is established and Yahoo Japan is divested, its buyback program alone could purchase every outstanding share with a billion dollars to spare, and then another $4.5 billion in cash left on its balance sheet. That said, Wall Street often gets valuations wrong, and when it does it can create a value investing opportunity. While I have never seen anything to the degree of Yahoo's valuation, or lack thereof, investors can only assume that at some point before SpinCo is formed shares will appreciate to reflect this apparent value opportunity. After all, Yahoo is going to have operating flexibility that's never been seen before, or at least in my lifetime, relative to its valuation. After SpinCo and Yahoo Japan are divested, it becomes an incredible acquisition target, if not for the business then for the cash alone. Yahoo will also have the resources to make company-changing acquisitions that will spark significant top-line growth. It could acquire a competing business like AOL and a fast-growing business like Yelp with cash to spare. Or, because it has very little debt, good credit, and the option to dilute its stock in exchange for cash, Yahoo could make a major acquisition of a company like Expedia if it wanted, something to completely change its identity and move in a different direction. The point is that Yahoo's options are wide open. As the date for SpinCo's existence nears, the upside opportunity in Yahoo becomes clearer. In my opinion, Yahoo is one of the best investment opportunities in technology, because with so much cash relative to the value of its existing core business, I can't imagine how Mayer and management could do anything that decreases long-term shareholder value. The ratio of cash to valuation creates a rare opportunity where there's essentially no long-term risk, making it a must buy. Source: There's Never Been An Opportunity Like Yahoo!
