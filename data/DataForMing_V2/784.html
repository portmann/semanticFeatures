Why I Wish That Apple Pay Was Accepted Everywhere - CellPhoneCity Blog When I first heard about the concept of paying for items in stores using only a smartphone , I was immediately intrigued.Â  I hoped that this would pave the way eliminating the use of cash from our society entirely, and all of the issues around theft (and for me, impulse buying) that come along with it. This was a few years ago, and I ended up purchasing an Android phone that had an NFC chip, excited to try out the new technology.Â  Of course, the first thing that I discovered was that there weren’t yet any stores where you could actually use your phone for payment.Â  The technology was there, but in order for this new wave to catch on, retailers were also going to have to buy-in. Fast forward a few years to when Apple announced that their iPhone 6 would be the first version with not only an NFC chip, but with a new payment framework called “ Apple Pay ” that would be already supported in a large number of retail stores.Â  The list of supported stores was impressive but not all-inclusive; Â Walgreens, Toys R Us, Sports Authority, McDonalds, and Panera were all included, Â but Target and Wal-Mart (and many others) were not.Â  Apparently some companies were reluctant to buy-in because they are planning to roll out their own competitive version of a similar technology in the near future. Drawn the to the iPhone for a variety of reasons (including Apple Pay), I ended up purchasing an iPhone a few months after it was released. This allowed for me to be in the first wave of folks who were able to experience the Apple Pay technology. Instead of taking out my wallet, I simply held my phone out against the NFC sensor at the register to make my purchase. The whole process worked quickly and flawlessly. The button on the bottom of an iPhone 6 doubles as a fingerprint reader which is a very nice security feature. Your fingerprint can be used to unlock the device, or even better, can be used as a digital signature when performing an Apple Pay transaction. This means that if you ever lose your phone, even if someone else manages to unlock your phone, they won’t be able to use your phone to pay for anything unless they have your same fingerprint (which they won’t). Even better, when it comes to the security of your transaction, using Apple Pay is as good as it gets. This is because of a feature called tokenization, which generates a unique token for each transaction, and provides this token to the merchant *instead* of providing the account number.Â  Since the account number is never actually shared with anyone, there is nothing for hackers or a malicious employee to steal. In this era of massive data breaches, Apple Pay’s approach is a breath of fresh air. While I am a big fan of Apple Pay, and use it wherever I can, the main frustration remains the limited number of places where it is accepted.Â  While the list of retailers that have opted-in continues to grow, I still have to carry a wallet full of cards with me when I am out and about.Â  I would love it if I could pay for my gas, my groceries, and a new pair of jeans– all with Apple Pay.Â  Hopefully that day will be here in the near future.
