How Facebook Can Use Messenger Platform To Create Billions Of Dollars - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha To screen ETFs by asset class, performance, yield and more, check out the ETF Hub. ETF Hub FB unveiled Messenger Platform at its f8 conference on Wednesday. While most are talking about ESPN and the Weather Channel as application partners, I am more focused on the retail aspect of this new service. Through retail and other recently announced payment services, FB has a legitimate chance to compete against EBAY and WU long-term. Lastly, FB is even set up nicely to compete against MA and V as a payment processor. The end result could be billions of dollars annually, a payments segment that's just as large as advertising for FB. Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) has officially ended its first day of the f8 developer conference in California, and among the highlights were new details for its popular Messenger app. Facebook unveiled the Messenger Platform , a way for Facebook users to now communicate and utilize other apps within Messenger. That said, we know that Facebook is all about making communication, sharing and conversations better; making the world a more connected place. But for investors, it all comes down to dollars and cents. So after listening to the conference, here is a way that Facebook might use the Messenger Platform to create billions of dollars annually. Messenger Platform allows developers to hook their apps into the Messenger service. Initially, there will be 40 apps when the Platform launches, including prominent apps like ESPN and the Weather Channel. Messenger users will be able to install apps into the Platform, and then share content from those apps with other users, or communicate directly with the app/business. As you might imagine, sharing scores from an NBA game, the weather or even inserting photos into a GIF with the use of Jib Jab app will be popular at first. But, none of these things create dollars and cents for Facebook, especially since the service is free for users. That said, one function on the Messenger Platform with retail does hold promise, and perhaps a glimpse into the future. Keep in mind, Facebook recently implemented user-to-user payment services into Messenger. The picture below shows how the Messenger Platform can work with partnered retailers. As seen, the Messenger Platform allows users to communicate directly with a company, and then make purchases. Facebook is yet to gain big retailers like Walmart (NYSE: WMT ), Best Buy (NYSE: BBY ), or Kohls (NYSE: KSS ) as developers/partners, but if so, purchasing volume could intensify quickly with such a service. In many ways, the Messenger Platform becomes one way for big box retailers to combat the faster growing, and often cheaper e-commerce giants like Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ). Therefore, I imagine that many big box retailers, and retailers in general will embrace this new service, gaining access to Messenger's 600 million users. Further, once a user makes a purchase, the following occurs. Facebook provides very detailed shipping information, and purchasing history via the supported app and UPS (NYSE: UPS ). While all of this is great, it still doesn't answer the question of how Facebook is going to monetize the service. Facebook is not charging any fees for Messenger Platform users, and by using the credit card that users have on file (Facebook), it is not collecting any processing or transaction fees. That said, Facebook has a history of giving away services now to earn revenue later. Facebook went several years without any ads on its core site because it didn't want to risk harming the user experience. After spending over $20 billion to acquire WhatsApp it still hasn't unveiled any meaningful monetization plans; the same applies to Instagram. While we can assume that Facebook will monetize these services via ads, video, subscriptions, etc. Facebook is yet to do so in part because it wants to maintain a high user experience. As it relates to Messenger, we already have pretty good indications that it will be monetized via payments. Given the fact that WhatsApp functions much like Messenger but has higher utilization in international markets, we can also assume it will be monetized similarly. Perhaps the biggest indication that payments will be the fundamental tool for these apps is hire of former PayPal Chief David Marcus to Head the development of Messenger. Also, Facebook has already implemented user-to-user payments on Messenger and with its latest Platform move, the company is adding retailers to the mix. Facebook's history does suggest that the monetization of Messenger Platform will remain non existent for some time. However, due to the sheer size of its user base combined with my expectations for widespread retail adoption of the service, it could be an approach that's just as meaningful as advertisements long-term. First off, Messenger Platform gives Facebook a unique approach. While Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Pay can be used for mobile orders, it is mostly intended for use in brick-and-mortar retail and for everyday purchases. Hence, PayPal remains the prominent online payments solution for consumers, having 163 million users at the end of its most recent quarter. So what Facebook has done thus far is bypass the market that Apple has already penetrated with Pay - and also bypassing its measly royalty from transaction processors Visa (NYSE: V ) and Mastercard (NYSE: MA ) - and instead focus on Western Union's (NYSE: WU ) consumer-to-consumer and PayPay's online payments business. Unfortunately, there is no way to know how or when Facebook will begin to monetize the service. But as a reference, Western Union collected over $1.1 billion in revenue from consumer-to-consumer transactions during its last quarter, and eBay's (NASDAQ: EBAY ) PayPal created $2.2 billion. Assuming that Facebook monetizes via fees, it will surely charge users much less than the noted Western Union and PayPal services, especially after providing the service free-of-charge at first. However, even if Facebook charges just 10% of the fee that Western Union and PayPal charges, I think it could very well collect just as much revenue. The reason is because Facebook has nearly twice as many users on its Messenger and WhatsApp services combined. Granted, this is assuming that WhatsApp will adopt a Messenger Platform-like service. I think it will, but on a global scale, adding currency exchange to the mix, and possibly even functioning like a bank of sorts. Albeit, Facebook is one of the most innovating and disruptive dot-com companies in history, implying that its plan for the Messenger Platform likely far exceeds my wildest dreams. This fact is important for investors to keep in mind, as Facebook has many moving parts as it relates to payments, not only on mobile messaging services, but also on desktop. As seen above, Facebook is also testing a "Buy" button. This is yet to be implemented on a large scale, but is possible due to a partnership with PayPal competitor Stripe. This further proves that Facebook's payment initiatives run deep in the company's core, and that it is a big plan for the future beyond mobile messaging. It is because of this that I think Facebook eventually goes the route of becoming a payment processor like Mastercard and Visa. Last year there was news that Facebook applied for a license in Ireland as an e-money service provider, allowing users to store, pay, or transfer currency. This led some to think Facebook was exploring the idea of becoming a bank, but given the number of transactions that might occur on its platform, I think challenging the likes of Visa and capitalizing on the sub-3% of transaction costs that processors earn would be a much more viable business; that and the 50% operating margin that payment processors typically carry due to low costs beyond initial infrastructure investments. The bottom line is that Facebook just launched Phase 1 in what I expect to be a long journey in becoming a meaningful player in the payments industry. Yes, it has started with Messenger and free services, but it could very well end with 1,000s of global retailers and service providers partnered with Facebook through the Messenger Platform and WhatsApp, with Facebook either collecting fees from its users or from retailers as a payment processor. Regardless, the future looks quite promising for Facebook's payment initiatives, and it all started at the f8 conference with the presentation of Messenger Platform.
