How Apple Pay Fits Into The Lucrative Mobile Payments Business - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha IDC's latest forecast pegs the mobile payments industry accounting for $1 trillion in transactions by 2017. That's a big opportunity for AAPL, but AAPL still won't earn meaningful revenue or profits. The only way that Apple Pay can be a real catalyst for AAPL is if it becomes a processor or bank. Last week IDC published a new report where it predicted mobile payments to top $1 trillion by 2017, a whopping 124% increase from the $500 billion expected this year. This represents the biggest dollar volume predicted in the mobile payments era. And what this illustrates is that mobile payments are growing fast throughout the world, not just areas like North America. Notably, IDC expects that the Asia-Pacific will account for most of this growth, and dollar value, which bodes well for Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) given its 20.1% share of China's mobile market with iOS, up from 12.8% last year. It would seem that mobile payments could be Apple's next big thing, a high-margin business to drive its next wave of growth. Unfortunately, it's not yet, and Apple has no one to blame but itself. Thankfully, Apple has the opportunity for a lucrative future in payments. Apple has a goal for 1.5 million retail locations to support Apple Pay by year's end. And after adding 300,000 with PayAnywhere in the U.S ., it's quickly approaching its mark. This after surpassing one million locations a few months back. Still, Apple has prioritized the U.S. and other regions where Near Field Communications (NFC) is prevalent for Apple Pay partners. However, with the Asia-Pacific adopting such technology, Apple's expansion in those regions with Pay is inevitable. Therefore, Apple has and is building a network that's poised to capture a significant part of that $1 trillion market. The problem is that Apple earns next to nothing for Apple Pay transactions, literally. For every $100 spent via Apple Pay, its partners, like Visa (NYSE: V ) and MasterCard (NYSE: MA ), allow Apple to earn just $0.15. In other words, if Apple were to capture $300 billion of the $1 trillion mobile payments business, it would earn only $450 million in revenue. For a company that's expected to create $233 billion in revenue this year, $450 million in revenue from Apple Pay is pennies. Further, even if Apple Pay revenue translates to $200 million in profit, it would still be pennies to Apple's near $70 billion in free cash flow over the last 12 months. With that said, it's a shame that given the growth and eventual size of the mobile payment industry that Apple couldn't find a way to generate higher revenues and profits. Perhaps Apple did not realize the opportunity that Apple Pay would become, as eMarketer estimated late last year that transaction value in the U.S. would not surpass $100 billion until 2018. Now it appears the industry will hit that mark one, maybe two years ahead of schedule mostly because of in-store mobile payments. Therefore, Apple needs to find a more lucrative way to monetize Apple Pay. This is something that I think is very possible given how fast the industry is expected to grow and how large it will ultimately become. Furthermore, Apple has proven over time that it doesn't like to be a middle man but rather prefers to own all aspects of an industry in which it operates in. In the beginning, Apple chose to negotiate a royalty with the likes of MasterCard and Visa. But what Apple has managed to do since then is build an enormous network that will soon include 1.5 billion locations where Apple Pay is accepted and has also familiarized itself with how the payments business works. That could be very valuable information and infrastructure in the years ahead. Specifically, with well over 800 million iTunes accounts, those who have credit card information, and a very large payments infrastructure in place, it seems like the next logical step is for Apple to become an actual payment processor like Visa and MasterCard. The advantages for doing so seem like a no brainer. The industry is one that requires very minimal capital expenditures once the payment infrastructure and network is in place - Apple already has the latter - and the margins are sky high. For a company that has over $200 billion in cash, there's no price that's too high for that payment infrastructure. With Apple already having the existing relationship with card issuing banks via Apple Pay, it would seem like a relatively easy transition into payment processing, or at least on the mobile front. These relationships with the likes of Citibank (NYSE: C ), Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ) and JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM ), among others, differ from payment processors like Visa and MasterCard. In essence, banks issue cards, so Apple would need partnerships with those banks in order to make Apple Pay successful as a payment processor. In other words, Apple Pay users would still be using their own debit and credit cards, unless Apple wanted to become a bank. But Apple Pay would be processing the actual transaction between buyer and seller rather than Visa or MasterCard. Consequently, it would also become a direct competitor of Visa and MasterCard, two companies that have built a duopoly of sorts because of how hard it would be for a new processor to establish a strong relationship with banks, retailers and consumers for that matter. However, by partnering with Visa and MasterCard in Apple Pay's infancy, and acting very similarly to a payment processor without the monetary advantages, Apple has formed those relationships and is now well positioned to take the next step of becoming the actual processor, if it chooses. The trade-off for Apple if it elected to become its own payment processor would be far higher transaction revenue and profits. While rates for payment processors remain largely unknown and vary depending on the country, most analysts figure around 3% on average. During Visa's last quarter , revenue was $3.5 billion, right around 3% of its $1.2 trillion payment volume. Lastly, Visa's operating margin sits right around 65%. So, if Apple were to replicate this performance with a 30% share of the future $1 trillion mobile payments market, we're talking about $9 billion in revenue and over $5.8 billion in profit. If that were applied to Apple's trailing 12-month operating income, it would represent a near 9% increase. That's fairly significant and is a change that could add significant shareholder value over time. Albeit, if Apple did elect to go this route, it would be bad for Visa and MasterCard. Apple Pay would then be a direct competitor, focused exclusively on mobile payments, an industry of payment processing that is expected to create the fastest growth over the next five years. Because of Apple's existing presence with Apple Pay and mobile payments, it could capture much of Visa and MasterCard's business in mobile payment processing. With all that said, the big, billion-dollar question remains whether it's likely that Apple will go this route? I think so. I think Apple has learned a lot about the payments industry over the last year, has built an incredible payment ecosystem (which is 90% of the challenge of entering payment processing), and has relationships with all of the largest banks. Finally, now is a good time to enter the market as a competitor in a processing sector that Jefferies recently described as a " calming regulatory environment ." Ironically, I think that both Visa and MasterCard both feared and expected that Apple would eventually enter the payment processing space. After all, neither Visa nor MasterCard have negotiated with any other mobile payments platform for a share of fees, not Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), Samsung, PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL ) or any other company. While $0.15 per $100 spent is next to nothing, it still proves that Visa and MasterCard preferred to be a partner with Apple versus a competitor. However, neither MasterCard nor Visa may have that choice. In closing, the biggest issues for Apple to make such a move successful include dealing with security and penetrating China. The security issue is obvious due to large, public cyber attacks. However, besides some leaked photos of Kate Upton and Jennifer Lawrence, caused by their own weak passwords, Apple's ecosystem has not yet been breached on a large scale, or at least it's not publicly known if it has. Given the size of its ecosystem, that's impressive. With regard to China, Reuters said back in July that MasterCard and Visa face bigger challenges in China than investors realize. These challenges include lower rates and the threat of Alipay as a competitor, which also could be a potential Apple partner. With Apple receiving just $0.15 per $100, just about any rate that Apple could earn in China would be an upgrade. The bottom line is that all pieces look in place for Apple to make a big move in the payment processing business. If so, it would appear that Apple Pay would be the company's next big thing, a catalyst that reflects its present growth and future opportunity. If not, and if Apple chooses not to utilize the ecosystem it created and the relationships it has built, then I guess investors can just look ahead to this trillion-dollar industry and wonder what could have been. Given Apple's ability to innovate and evolve over the last decade, I'd be shocked to see Apple miss this opportunity. Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL.
