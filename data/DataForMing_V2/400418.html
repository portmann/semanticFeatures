Ford Takes 2 More Steps In The Right Direction - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford sales in China up 7% last month, rounding out more great news from the company's international expansion. We predict international markets will continue to drive Ford's profit higher as investments continue to bear fruit. We have been writing about Ford (NYSE: F ) for the better part of the last year and a half. Despite what we believe to be decent news and great operational numbers from the company, the stock has yet to respond. You can clearly see the divergence over the last year in the amount of sales the company is booking versus the price that equity markets have assigned to its common stock. We think this is due to an irrational fear of the auto credit markets. We think these markets will likely turn, as we are heading toward the end of a 7-8 debt cycle, but we've presented an idea to short CACC as a pair trade with F for investors worried about this impact. Ford's valuation now prices in catastrophe, which we don't think is a realistic scenario. Thus we believe Ford to continue to be undervalued. Again, this morning, we have great news about the company's operations overseas and some renewed hope with an investment in a cloud services company, but the market will likely shrug this off and the common stock remains a value in our opinion. This morning, Ford announced that sales in China were up 7% for the month. Sales have again been led by SUVs and Ford continues to execute internationally. Ford announces sales in China were up 7% in April to 82,324 vehicles with SUV demand strong. Sales at the Changan Ford Automobiles JV rose 14% Y/Y to 58,802 vehicles, while sales fell 10% for the Jiangling Motor JV to 82,471 vehicles. YTD Ford sales in China are up 7% to 391,294 vehicles, led by a strong performance by the Escort model. The company just posted a fantastic quarter and CEO Mark Fields has been dripping with confidence over his last few public appearances. We have continued to state that international growth is going to be paramount for Ford. The company has shown us time and time again since the auto crisis that it can execute here in the United States. It has also shown us that it can innovate, with its new endeavor in the aluminum Ford F-150. The company has done a good job returning capital to shareholders, issuing a $1 billion special dividend, and the company is also prudently investing in its growth globally, which we like to see versus buying back a lot of stock. In short, the company is trying to conquer the entire global automotive market. Admirable goals that seem to be moving in the right direction for the company. With domestic sales as its backbone, we think Ford's push for profitability in other countries will be the sole driver that helps it continue to exceed earnings expectations moving forward. The company's valuation at this point is pricing in total failure and total disaster in the auto financing market. In addition to the great news of China, it was also announced this morning that Ford was making a $182 million investment in Pivotal, a silicon valley based cloud services company, alongside names like Microsoft. Ford had also recently committed over $1 billion in China to help research and develop smart cars. Microsoft, as you may remember, already was once a partner with Ford and has helped it with its SYNC in-car automated system for use inside vehicles. We believe this commitment to automation and evolving the company's products will continue to literally pay dividends for Ford moving forward. So what kind of valuation do we get for this great news? F EV to Revenues (TTM) data by YCharts As you can see, Ford's valuation seems ridiculously low. It's worth mentioning the $130 billion in debts the company currently has on its balance sheet, but it's valuation of 6.8x forward earnings and an EV/sales of 0.8x leaves room for some conservative multiple expansion. Granted, auto companies don't get premium multiples, but Ford's valuation is so low that we can easily see a scenario for 30% upside, should operations continue to impress. This China news wraps up a couple of impressive quarters. Looking forward, Ford's continued investments in itself pave the way for an even more impressive future. With Ford's steady dividend and continued confidence in its operations, we believe that the company is operating with the perfect mixture of innovation and operational execution. Ford continues to pay an attractive dividend, and as we have seen, the company is not opposed to returning more capital to shareholders. For those with a multiple year long-term outlook, we continue to believe that Ford is an attractive investment at these levels.
