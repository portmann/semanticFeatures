Be Careful, AWS Could Disappoint Amazon.com Shareholders Next Week - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha AMZN has added $40 billion in market capitalization since the first quarter, much of which is tied directly to AWS. AWS may be worth as much as $85 billion. That's a big value for an asset with just one reported quarter under its belt, in a seasonally strong quarter. I think everyone can agree that Amazon.com's (NASDAQ: AMZN ) cloud services business AWS had a very impressive showing in the company's first quarter, surprising even the most bullish of analysts. As an investor who has followed cloud infrastructure services since the beginning, I immediately expressed my approval of AWS's performance, arguing that it could very well be worth $85 billion after Amazon.com's first quarter report. That would be $35 billion more than analysts at Evercore valued AWS at, and conveniently, Amazon.com has added about $40 billion in market capitalization since reporting its first quarter. So needless to say, expectations are sky high for AWS, and headed into the second quarter, that may be dangerous. First and foremost, this is just an observation, but something that I feel is important headed into Amazon.com's earnings report next week. Specifically, estimates for Amazon.com's second quarter report have consistently increased, with recent upgrades from BofA, UBS, Morgan Stanley, and Bernstein just to name a few. Given the fact that AWS grew revenue by 49% and had an operating margin of nearly 17% in the first quarter, investors are very excited about both its short and long-term prospects. Nonetheless, Amazon.com chose to disclose AWS data for the first time in a seasonally strong first quarter. Prior to Amazon.com reporting AWS's operating performance, many investors looked to data specialist Synergy Research for figures. According to Synergy , Amazon.com grew AWS revenue a whopping 67% in the first quarter of 2014, significantly outperforming a cloud infrastructure services market that's been growing at a near 50% annualized rate. However, in the second quarter of last year, AWS revenue growth decelerated to just 38% year-over-year. This was based on Amazon.com's North American Other revenue, which largely consisted of AWS. Further, this deceleration in the second period last year marked a rare decline sequentially, as sales in the business were down 3% from the very strong first quarter. With that said, I do believe that Amazon.com was somewhat calculated in when they decided to finally report AWS metrics. It chose the first quarter, which was the strongest period in terms of year-over-year growth in 2014. Therefore, I am concerned about the second quarter, mainly because of how bad it performed last year, fearing that there could be some seasonality to the performance of AWS. Notably, that's something we don't know right now because Amazon.com just recently started to announce AWS metrics. Further, before I accept the fact that AWS can maintain mid-teen operating margins, I certainly want to see that as proof over a longer span of time. For many, AWS's profit was a deciding factor for investing in Amazon.com, but if that margin proves to be unsustainable, AMZN could fall. In retrospect, we're talking about an asset that accounts for just 7% of revenue and 40% of the company's market capitalization. This means that anything disappointing could easily result in a big stock drop. That said, Amazon.com's valuation gains in 2015 have ignored any and all risks associated with AWS, and investors seem very content with the idea that AWS can repeat its first quarter on a consistent basis. Personally, I am a big fan of AWS, and believe that it will continue to control at least 30% of the cloud infrastructure services space as it grows far larger. However, I also think that Amazon.com's valuation has risen too fast in response to just one single quarter for AWS, and that it could come back down to earth by the end of this month.
