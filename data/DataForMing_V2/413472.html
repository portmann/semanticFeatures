Ask the Readers: Do You Keep a Budget? It's widely agreed that one of the best ways to take control of your finances is to set up a budget. Experts recommend that you start simple for your first budget and get into the nitty-gritty stuff as you become more comfortable with the process, but many people burn out on a budget that doesn't work for them or the task seems too big to even begin. Alternatively, some people have discovered that budgets in general aren't effective for their situation, and they find other ways to keep their finances in order. Do you keep a budget?
