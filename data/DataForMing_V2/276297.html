As Hardware Becomes Software, Intel Goes Shopping - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha The $16.7 billion Altera acquisition makes Intel's strategy clear. Intel will try to buy the best design concepts while they are young to fill its fabs. Under CEO Brian Krzanich, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) has found a new way to adopt to the requirement of Moore's Second Law. Instead of using its fabrication plant to drive chip designs, it is using chip designs to fill its fabrication plants. It's an historic reversal made possible, and necessary, by the increasingly high capital costs of making semiconductors. Moore's Law holds that chips can pack more circuits on the same piece of silicon every year or so. Moore's Second Law is the corollary, the fact that each new generation of chip-making equipment also costs that much more to make. As a result there are fewer and fewer players in the capital intensive chip production game, and it's imperative that those factories be kept humming with contracts from "fab-less" chip designers. Of course, doing that only gives you a tiny piece of the designer's profit. Thus the new strategy - buy the best designers, those whose concepts can produce profitable products for years to come. Altera makes FPGAs - Field Programmable Gate Arrays. It's one of the big new trends in chip design, and a big key to the Internet of Things. The chip isn't just waiting for software, it contains software, and the software it contains defines its function. Intel will pair Altera's FGPAs with its Xeon microprocessors to create complete, highly-complex products, like security systems in data centers, or processing systems in airplanes. But that's not the big story here. The big story is that Intel is now on the hunt for other, similar acquisitions. It has already bought itself the number-one position in the booming Internet of Things market . You can expect it to buy its way into other markets as well, like mobile. All this will place further strain on Intel's once-pristine balance sheet, but that was inevitable due to the rising costs of building and maintaining fabrication plants. My view for years has been that Intel needs to separate the manufacturing part of the company from the design or software part, but Intel has chosen a different path, buying up the designs it needs to keep the fabs operating while those designs are on the leading edge of their growth path. What this means, to me, is that Intel is going to become less a technology and more a mergers-and-acquisitions story going forward. The most important events of its year won't be its developer conferences or trade shows showing off products with Intel inside, but press releases where it announces new acquisitions. It can work, but Intel's roadmap needs to identify the right targets, it has to acquire those targets while they remain relatively small, and it has to integrate those company teams into its organization seamlessly. It's a lot less straightforward than building a fab. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
