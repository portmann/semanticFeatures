But ever the hopeless romantic, the carmaker’s CEO is once again pining to be in the arms of another manufacturer. Sergio Marchionne told reporters last week that he believes a future merger could be in the cards between his company and Toyota Motor, Volkswagen, or Ford Motor, Automotive News reports. The CEO’s argument is that carmakers are throwing away piles of money by not merging and becoming more efficient. “$10 billion of capital that could have been saved has been wasted” in the last year, claims Marchionne. Other executives with the automaker echoed Marchionneâ€™s sentiments over the weekend noting that the companyâ€™s ideas of a consolidated auto market are â€œunchangedâ€? and â€œstill actual.â€? FCA Chairman John Elkann told shareholders in a letter last week that the company â€œneeds two to tangoâ€? when it comes to spending billions of dollars on technology advancements, noting that â€œmost of our competitors are busy with the great opportunities that technological disruption has to offer.â€? Automotive News reports that Ford was quick to issue a statement following FCAâ€™s renewed merger fever. “As we consistently have said, Ford has no plan or interest other than to continue to accelerate our One Ford plan,â€? the company said. Back in January, Marchionne all but abandoned efforts to consolidate the auto industry after just about everyone said â€œno, thanks.â€? He went on to announce that FCA wasnâ€™t going to enter into anything â€œas long as there are better alternatives out there than the ones we were being offeredâ€¦ that we should not be considering what I consider to be sub-optimal choices for the industry going forward.â€? looking for love No One Wants To play No Merger Mania Here Sergio Marchionne merger auto maker manufacturers general motors Fiat Chrysler CEO: Forget About All That GM Merger Talk Fiat Chrysler Spins Off Ferrari Division, Drops Hostile Bid To Merge With General Motors Class-Action Lawsuit Accuses Fiat Chrysler Of Hiding Safety Issues To Increase Stock Value NHTSA Probing Fiat Chrysler’s Response To At Least 20 Safety Recalls, Schedules July 2 Public Hearing Previous Apple: Why Should We Help Unlock iPhone Of Someone Who Has Already Pled Guilty?
