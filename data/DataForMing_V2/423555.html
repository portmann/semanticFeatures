Yes, billions: this week, McDonald’s marked the two billionth bag of the fruit given out with Happy Meals. Children under five haven’t lived in a world where the apple slices aren’t the default side dish in a Happy Meal: that change happened in 2011 . Most of the slices have been served up since then: before the change to a half-serving of fries and a half-serving of apple slices, the chain admitted that most customers didn’t seek out the fruit, with maybe 11% of orders ordering it instead of fries. McDonald’s would rather have you remember that it’s kids under 12 who have never seen a Happy Meal without apples, since they introduced the option in April of 2004.
