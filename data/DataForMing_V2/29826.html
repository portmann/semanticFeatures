Youku Tudou up 2% after Netflix backs ad-free China expansion - Youku.com Inc. (NYSE:YOKU) | Seeking Alpha To screen ETFs by asset class, performance, yield and more, check out the ETF Hub. ETF Hub Apr 16 2015, 12:32 ET | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Shares of Youku Tudou ( YOKU +2%) have given back some gains after rising as much as 6.7% this morning. One reason for the move could be some clarity on Netflix's China expansion plans. CEO Reed Hastings says Netflix will stick to its core and pursue a subscription video streaming service, rather than provide free entertainment supported by ads (as Chinese consumers are accustomed to). "That may confine us to being only part of the market the first couple years, but that's what we would do," says Hastings. The company still needs permission to operate in one of the world's largest video markets. Youku Tudou is China's biggest online video company, and due to different (or unenforced) copyright laws, Youku has carried copyrighted material without license. Years ago, Tudou had pioneered advertising systems for video sites at heavy scale. ETF Performance: View ETF performance across key asset classes and investing themes
