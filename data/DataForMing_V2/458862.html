Apple Will Need To Raise Over $50 Billion In Debt The Next Two Years - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Almost all of the companyâ€™s US generated cash goes to dividends. It may be waiting until after the elections to get a read on lower taxes before it raises a lot of debt. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) increased its stock buyback program from $140 billion by March 2017 to $175 billion by March 2018 when it released its March 2016 quarter results . At the same time it announced a $0.57 per share per quarter dividend and that the company should spend $75 billion in dividend payments in the same timeframe. This article delves into Apple's cash needs for stock buybacks vs. my previous article analyzing its dividend payments . To pay its dividends and buy back shares Apple has to use US based cash or debt but it is not generating nearly enough US profits so it will have to materially increase the amount of debt to achieve its goal. Apple could decide to pay the additional US taxes on its overseas profits but I suspect it is waiting until after the elections to see if a tax holiday or lower tax rate is implemented. Apple had $233 billion in cash and investments at the end of the March quarter along with $80 billion in debt for a net cash position of $153 billion. However $209 billion was overseas so it only had $24 billion in the US and actually had a negative US cash position of $56 billion since it has used most if not all of the debt it has taken on to pay dividends or buyback stock. In fiscal 2012 and 2013 Apple generated about $13.5 billion of US cash each year, which jumped to $20.5 billion in fiscal 2014 but fell to $18.1 billion in fiscal 2015. For the first two quarters of fiscal 2016 it has fallen 25% to $9.6 billion vs. $12.8 billion in fiscal 2015. If the next two quarters exhibit the same decline fiscal 2016's US generated cash will be about $13.6 billion. Fortunately the amount of US cash the company generates covers its dividend payments. These were $10.6, $11.1 and $11.6 billion in fiscal 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively, and are projected to be approximately $12.1 billion in fiscal 2016. However if Apple isn't able to increase how much US cash it generates and it increases the dividend by about 10% a year offset by buying back about 4% of its shares by fiscal 2018 all of its US profits will go to paying dividends and any stock buybacks will have to come from additional debt. Apple still has to buyback $54 billion of stock Since it started the buybacks Apple has spent $121 billion on stock buybacks ($116.6 billion) and net settling shares ($4.6 billion), which leaves $54 billion to be spent of the $175 billion goal. In fiscal 2016 I estimate that Apple will generate about $1.5 billion in US cash to buyback shares after it pays the dividends. This amount could shrink to $0 in fiscal 2018 so that it may only generate about $2 billion over the next two years of the $54 billion it needs to buy shares. Additionally if this trend continues Apple could be forced to raise debt to pay its dividend or repatriate international profits and pay additional taxes on them. The company generated an astounding $69.4 billion in cash flow in fiscal 2015 after capital expenditures, paying for intangible assets and acquisitions. Even though for the first six months of fiscal 2016 this is down about 25% Apple could still generate about $50 billion before it pays for dividends and stock buybacks in fiscal 2016. However since most of it is generated overseas to avoid increasing its debt levels management and the Board will have to decide that it is willing to pay the additional US taxes. Or it can at least wait to see if either a tax holiday or a lower tax rate is agreed upon after the elections. Debt could balloon to $130 billion or more At current course and speed Apple could have $130 billion in debt by March 2018 if my US generated cash, dividend payments and stock buyback estimates are correct. I'm not a debt expert but at some point in time the interest rate it pays should increase (but could still be very manageable given the low interest rate environment we are in) or it will be limited in how much it can borrow. This could then impact its ability to buy back more shares, which means it will need more cash to pay dividends if the company decides to increase the quarterly payment since the share count won't decrease vs. the the 5% to 6% decline it has the past two years.
