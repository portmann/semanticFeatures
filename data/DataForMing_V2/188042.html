It's NOT Intel Inside Microsoft's New Windows 10 Lumia Phones - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel investors should no longer expect an x86-powered Lumia phone to come soon. It looks like Microsoft will continue its exclusive deal with Qualcomm Snapdragons even for entry-level Lumia phones. Paul Thurrott predicted that entry-level Windows 10 devices from Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) would use Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) x86 Atom processors this year. PCWorld also discussed this alleged rekindling of the Wintel alliance for Windows 10 phones. They deemed the Atom x3 SoFIA chip ideal for Lumia Windows 10 phones. However, it looks like Microsoft will stick to Snapdragons for its new flagship and entry-level Windows 10 Lumia smartphones. A leaked Spanish-language presentation slide of the upcoming entry-level Lumia 550 says it has a 1 GHz quad-core Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) Snapdragon processor. Microsoft's snub might be due to Intel's decision to delay delivery of 4G/LTE-enabled versions of the Atom x3 to 2016. Intel previously promised to deliver an LTE-capable Atom X3 SoC during this 2nd half of 2015. Intel will just have to make do by supplying its Atom x3 chips to Chinese white-box phone/phablets vendors. Intel shareholders, therefore, should not expect that Microsoft will use the Atom x3 this year (or in the near future). Nadella is streamlining the Lumia product portfolio to a more limited number of models. The Lumia 550 is likely to be Microsoft's last entry-level phone in 2015. It is mostly likely the only successor to the $175 Lumia 535 . Google ( GOOG , GOOGL ) and its partners previously used MediaTek chips for its first-gen batches of $100-110 Android One smartphones. It has shifted to using Snapdragon 410 for its more expensive $140++ 2nd-generation Android One handsets. My suggestion now is that Intel, being close to Google, should try positioning the higher-priced Atom x3 processors for the more expensive versions of Android One smartphones. If Microsoft continues its exclusive deal with Qualcomm, then Intel has to get in bed with Google's ambitious grand master plan to saturate the world with affordable Android One smartphones. Intel's long-term mobile strategy is in vain if the only global OEM that's using x86 Atom chips for smartphones is ASUSTeK ( OTC:ASUUY ). Google's Android One project is a gateway for Intel to persuade more Android manufacturers to trust the Atom x3. Letting Google subsidize sub-$100 Android One handsets is also great, because Intel won't have to offer discounts for its processors intended for Android One partner OEMs. If Google distrusts Intel-designed Atom processors for its pure Android One handsets, then Intel can just tap its partner, Rockchip , to create a custom version of the Atom x3. The stock Android OS of Android One smartphones probably demands that an x86 chip should be 100% compatible with Android apps and Google Mobile Services. It is true that Intel is already delivering 64-bit x86 Atom chips that match the power efficiency of ARM-based processors. However, it was known before that previous Intel mobile processors were incompatible with some Android apps. Rockchip's long years of designing chips for Android devices might help it find a way for Atom x3 chips to be fully compatible with all Android apps. Not getting design wins from Microsoft Lumia devices is a painful reminder that Intel still has a long way to go in the mobile chips business. Aside from snubbing the Atom x3 in the Lumia 550, Microsoft's new flagship Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL Windows 10 phones are also still using Snapdragons . I believe Intel's Cherry Trail Atom x5 is as good as the Snapdragon 808 and Snapdragon 810. I even think that the older Atom Z3580 chip is already better for Windows 10 than any ARM-based processors. The Asus ZenFone 2 Android phone (with 4GB of RAM and Atom Z3580 CPU) could run the full version of the Windows 7 desktop operating system. It should also pretty easily run the pared-down, lightweight Windows 10 Mobile OS. I will continue to remain long on INTC, hoping that Microsoft and Acer will eventually realize that only an x86 processor is qualified to make Windows 10 OS mobile phones get the Pocket PC badge. I am also long QCOM, but I doubt if that company would be able to create an ARM-based processor that could be compatible with all the legacy x86 software used by enterprise users. Even without Microsoft's support for x86 mobile chips, INTC is a Buy. Intel could dump its Atom x3 chips on to white-box Chinese OEMs who make sub-$100 Android phones and cellular calling-enabled tablets.
