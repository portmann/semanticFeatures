Intel Should Buy Altera And Then You Should Buy Intel - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Acquiring ALTR would give INTC strategic competitive advantages vs. its competition. Those capabilities are essential to maintaining INTC's high-margin Data Center Group. If a $54/share offer is the magic number, that makes this a pricey transaction but it remains in the ball park. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) needs to acquire Altera (NASDAQ: ALTR ) as a mechanism to protect its server business and extend its penetration into data center communications and storage products as well as other markets. A couple of months ago, the Wall Street Journal reported that INTC and ALTR were in acquisition talks. Within the next week or so it was reported that the talks had broken off after no agreement could be reached. Since then, we had heard unconfirmed reports that a number of ALTR's larger shareholders expressed displeasure that the presumed $54/share offer was rejected. Keep in mind that ALTR's stock was trading at $34/share the day before the rumor hit the market. The most common question on the INTC side of this equation seemed to be, "Why Altera?" because they would only represent about 4% of INTC's revenue. First, INTC's Data Center Group (DCG) is its highest growth segment as well as having the highest profitability (see Figure 1). As you can see, it grew about 20% for the trailing 12 months ending March 30, 2015, and is expected to generate mid-teens growth for the next several years. Equally important is the margin structure of DCG which is more than 20% higher than the Client Group. The reason for the higher margins is that INTC can price based upon value to the customer in an environment that offers little in the way of alternatives. Additionally, the highest growth part of DCG is its cloud customers who are willing to pay more for semi-custom parts that deliver higher performance. Cloud customers were growing north of 30% as of the company's last analyst meeting, representing about 23% of server units but 35% of revenue. Last fall INTC had 35 custom SKUs (stock keeping units) for cloud customers going to 50 this year and was willing to do full-custom silicon given the volumes the cloud players generate. However, the second issue is that those same cloud customers and others would certainly love to have an alternative solution that may provide the benefit of price pressure, if only for the benefit of negotiating power. At some point investors should expect a viable ARM-based solution will enter the market. Most sell-side analysts have the alternatives ultimately gaining about a 10% share of the existing x86-based server business over the next several years. You can argue whether this market share figure is high or low but the point is the same…there will be competition. So how does INTC fend off this competition? Simple…run faster than your competition and do things the others can't. The company has long been known for its manufacturing prowess and that translates into the ability to push its process technology faster than the competition and manufacture in volume on the leading edge. That may keep most of the traditional enterprise customers in the fold but the cloud players and other high-performance computing (HPC) applications may be looking for more. Enter ALTR and its field programmable gate arrays (FPGA). FPGAs consist of logic blocks and memory that can be connected by an engineer at a customer (hence field programmable) to perform a repetitive task that may be common to that customer or application. Within the data center, FPGAs are increasingly being used in server, communications and storage applications to perform repetitive functions. As an example, an Ethernet switch might use a FPGA to encrypt and decrypt data on the fly as it exits and enters the confines of the data center. The same field programmability is attractive to the cloud customers in prepping data to be processed on their servers or in performing analytics. As ALTR has had plans to use INTC as its foundry at the 14 nanometer (NM) process node, the two have a working relationship. To the best of my knowledge, INTC still plans to add ALTR's FPGA as a "front-end" in the same package with some of its server parts. This plan seems to confirm the wisdom of offering additional customization capabilities via the FPGA. The next logical step would be to integrate the FPGA logic onto the server silicon itself. The FPGA market is a $4-$5 billion market growing in the high-single digits and is dominated by two companies: Xlinix with about 50% market share, and ALTR with about 30% share. They have been replacing many application specific integrated circuits (ASIC), a $21 billion market and declining, since they arrived in the late 1980s. Consequently, they are used across a very broad array of end-markets, particularly when time-to-market is an important criterion. That broad end-market exposure also becomes a plus for INTC as it searches for diversification away from the PC. INTC and ALTR are not all that dissimilar financially. As you can see in Figure 2, the margin structure between the two is quite comparable as both deliver value to their respective customers. Both generate solid cash flow yields but, because INTC has wafer fabrication facilities, its free cash flow yield ([CFO-Capex]/Revenue) is substantially lower, but that's to be expected. So the question from our perspective becomes, what should INTC pay for ALTR? Let's start with the semiconductor transactions that have taken place in the recent past for valuation metrics (see Figure 3). What we see is that value is in the eye of the beholder (it always is or we wouldn't have the delightful repartee that commentary elicits here at SA). For deals perceived to be "strategic," the acquirer is willing to pay more versus the bolt-on deals at the opposite end of the spectrum. We arrive at a median value of 3.6x trailing sales. Source: SEC Filings, company reports If the rumored $54/share valuation is indeed correct, investors would be looking at a $16.4 billion transaction or about 8.6x trailing revenue. Not inexpensive by any means but at the same time not wildly out of the ball park or the most expensive. What becomes critical will be how to structure such a transaction and that, obviously, is left to the bankers. However, let's throw out some "what ifs." INTC has $21 billion in cash (net cash $8.6 billion) but is generating about $21 billion of cash from operations each year. Short-term debt coupled with some of the existing cash (say the net position of $8.6 billion) could be used and then paid off with the cash generated by operations. Given the current low rate environment, by my calculations, $5.0 billion of debt (at 2.70%) would generate a $0.02 hit to EPS. Keep in mind that the net cost of the transaction will be reduced by the value of ALTR's net cash or about $3.0 billion. Assuming ALTR's operations will continue to expand (as FPGAs continue to take market share from ASICs) there is the potential to grow their margins as well by leveraging INTC's manufacturing. That should enhance cash flow from the ALTR side. From my perspective, what we don't want to see is the issuance of shares for all or part of the transaction. INTC has been doing a solid job of reducing its shares outstanding (returning cash to shareholders) by about 200 million or 4% of the total over the last 12 months. Issuing shares for M&A puts a halt on your ability to repurchase shares. Repaying debt from the cash generation may mitigate the repurchase program for a while but it doesn't legally prohibit you from doing so. The bottom line from my perspective is that the acquisition of ALTR would: Continue to allow INTC to separate from any competitors; Enable it to maintain a very high margin DCG; Provide an entry into new markets; and Source: Intel Should Buy Altera And Then You Should Buy Intel Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.
