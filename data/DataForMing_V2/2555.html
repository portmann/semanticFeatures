Intel Has Given Dividend And Income Investors A Gift: Qualcomm - Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) | Seeking Alpha As a dividend growth investor for retirement I'm amazed that there are times when I am given a little gift with seemingly bad news. While on the surface, the Intel "news" might appear wonderful for Intel, as far as I am concerned, it is a blessing in disguise for Qualcomm. I have been following the recent developments surrounding the Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) announcements that it will be dramatically enhancing shareholder value in the form of consistent and meaningful dividend increases as well as a larger shareholder buyback plan. Effective immediately, the Board has authorized the Company to repurchase up to $15 billion of its common stock. The $15 billion program replaces the previous program, which had a $2.1 billion authorization remaining..... The Board also approved a 14 percent increase in Qualcomm's quarterly cash dividend, raising the annualized dividend payout to $1.92 per share of common stock. As a dividend growth investor this is music to my ears, and to anyone who has been watching this story unfold who is inclined to purchase QCOM, now might be the best time to begin building a position thanks to another chip maker: Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ). But Wait, Intel Will Be Supplying A 2016 Apple iPhone With Chips That Has Always Been A Revenue Source For QCOM! According to this report , Intel could be a supplier to Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) in 2016 for a new smartphone. While neither Apple nor Intel are commenting, the report offers this: Intel will provide the fast wireless modem chip for a new Apple smartphone in 2016, VentureBeat has learned from two sources with knowledge of the companies' plans.....Intel's new 7360 LTE modem will occupy a socket on the new iPhone's circuit board that's long been reserved for Qualcomm chips....For months Apple engineers have been making trips to Munich, Germany to work with Intel engineers to ready the Intel LTE chip for the iPhone, one of our sources said.....Qualcomm has long been the leader in providing chips for phones, and has provided the modems for generations of iPhones. But our sources say Apple and Qualcomm have an uneasy relationship. If I were an INTC shareholder, I would be jumping for joy, and if I owned QCOM, I would be more than ticked off. The markets took this news that way and sent the shares of QCOM tumbling to roughly $70.00/share the other day, which is around 15% off of its 52-week high of nearly $83.00/share, while INTC soared by about 4% at the time of the news . Some weak forward guidance from QCOM has also turned the stock into an underperformer since the last earnings conference call : In the face of a decent quarter, that announcement has put pressure on the share price since then, and aside from the bounce up to about $74.00 on the day it announced its greatly enhanced shareholder value efforts. The Bottom Line Is Once Again All About Income As of today, the share price of QCOM is sitting at about $69.50, which is not far from its 52-week lows of about $62.25/share. While I believe there could be further price erosion as the INTC story unfolds, or gains more clarity and credibility, I also believe that dividend growth investors can take advantage of the slump in the QCOM share price to, at the very least, ease into a stock that has formally and publicly announced its intent to reward shareholders with stronger dividend increases and massive share buybacks. Since 2003, QCOM has paid and increased dividends every year, and is now in year 16 of that effort. I believe the company will be a dividend aristocrat as it implied: "Our business continues to generate substantial operating cash flow, and today's announcement represents an important step in returning that cash to our owners while still preserving the strategic flexibility needed to drive stockholder value through growth," said Steve Mollenkopf, CEO of Qualcomm Incorporated. "I am pleased that we continue to build on our track record of returning capital to stockholders, having exceeded each of our capital return commitments in 2014 and returned approximately $37 billion to stockholders since these programs began in 2003." In the last 10 years, QCOM has increased its dividend from about $.32/share annually, to the latest number of $1.92/share. While the current yield is "only" 2.40%, the rate of increases over an extended period of time has been exceptional. Unless my math is wrong, it looks like about an average of a 20%-25% annual increase over the past decade, including the latest 14% hike. As a dividend growth investor for retirement, I myself view this company as a potential core holding for any income-seeking investor who wants their income to grow consistently into the future for a more secure retirement and/or financial future. The Basic Fundamentals Appear To Display A Decent Buy Right Now As most of you know I use a very simple measurement to evaluate a stock as a potential buy. If the share price is between the 52-week high and low, it gives me more reason to investigate. Since I myself am not trying to time the market, and quality companies will always trend higher (especially dividend aristocrats), I do not get carried away with charts and graphs to try to pinpoint my purchases. The share price today is leaning towards the lower range of that 52-week midpoint share price ($74.00), and by beginning a position in QCOM at current levels, not only can you increase income immediately, but when the share price rebounds, an increase in total returns could be achieved as well. To take advantage of the recent downward trend of QCOM share pricing, I would break up my purchases into quarter-sized buys. So if your goal is to own 1,000 shares, why not consider buying 250 shares at a time, spaced evenly over the course of the next 4-8 weeks as more of any INTC news may affect the QCOM share price. Some other valuation basics for your review (from Yahoo Finance): The dividend payout ratio is just 34%, which lends itself to solid increases in the years ahead. 81% of all outstanding shares are held by institutions. If the rumors are true about INTC replacing QCOM with some Apple smartphone chips, then why would the company come out with this announcement ? Intel (INTC) now expects Q1 revenue of $12.5B-$13.1B, below prior guidance of $13.2B-$14.2B and a $13.7B consensus. Gross margin guidance remains at 60% (+/- 2%), with lower volumes offset by higher ASPs. "All other expectations" have been withdrawn - that presumably includes full-year guidance for mid-single digit revenue growth. Guidance will be updated during Intel's April 14 Q1 report. If the great news about INTC being used by Apple to replace some QCOM chips were accurate, wouldn't the market be forward looking beyond this bit of news? INTC shares are down 4.14% today. QCOM shares are down today as well, but which dividend stock would YOU favor more right now? Disclaimer: The opinions of the author are not recommendations to either buy or sell any security.
