Don't Let A Few Bad Apples Spoil This New REIT - Apple Hospitality REIT, Inc. (NYSE:APLE) | Seeking Alpha Perhaps APLE's planned liquidity event validates the painful past in which the non-traded REITs previously faced class-action lawsuits stemmed by an SEC investigation. APLE joins a long list of other Lodging REITs in REIT-dom. This week Apple Hospitality REIT Inc. (NYSE: APLE ) began trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Previously structured as a Non-Traded REIT and in connection with the listing, APLE said it commenced a modified Dutch auction tender offer to purchase up to $200 million of its common shares. The shares began trading at $18.00 per share and the (Dutch auction) offer will expire at midnight ET June 22, unless extended or withdrawn. APLE intends to fund the offer with funds available under its unsecured revolving credit facility. After the first week of trading APLE shares closed at $18.21 - almost flat compared to the opening bid of $18.00. Apple Hospitality was formed in March 2014 with the merger of Apple REIT Seven Inc., Apple REIT Eight Inc. and Apple REIT Nine Inc. In February 2014, the company amended its articles of incorporation to provide for a 50% reverse share split of its common stock. While the new Apple REIT (the public company) has finally gotten its day in the sun, the older non-traded REITs (7, 8, and 9) have become bitter like a basket of bad apples. Perhaps the planned liquidity event validates the painful past in which the non-traded REITs previously faced class-action lawsuits stemmed by an SEC investigation over allegations related to improper disclosure of pricing shares, among other things. In February 2014 the three Apple REITs (along with Apple Hospitality) entered into a settlement agreement. Without admitting or denying the allegations, the companies agreed to the issuance of an administrative order alleging deficient disclosures in the shares' pricing process, as well as deficiencies in disclosures relating to executive compensation and certain transactions among the REITs. In March 2015, a federal appeals court dismissed all claims in a class-action lawsuit filed in 2011 against Apple REIT Ten Inc. and Apple REIT Nine, one of the Apple Hospitality predecessor companies. The suit alleged that the REITs' registration statements failed to disclose material information regarding sharp declines in share values at prior Apple REITs, which pursued nearly identical investment strategies, and claimed that the REITs' strategy "was virtually guaranteed to lose investors' capital." (Source: SNL Financial) Shares of Apple REIT Seven, Apple REIT Eight and Apple REIT Nine were originally offered for sale - in offerings that launched in 2005 for the first company and 2007 for the latter two - for prices of either $10.50 or $11.00 per share. In a March 2015 filing Apple Hospitality said that the estimated value of the company (as of Dec. 31, 2014) was $10.30 (the midpoint of a per-share value range, developed by a third party, of $9.80 to $10.80). The company's per-share book value at the end of 2014, meanwhile, was $8.06. Mr. Market has placed an initial valuation on APLE shares at around $18.00 (split adjusted = $9.00) and while that's around $2.00 over book value ($16.00 after split), the company's third party values the shares closer to $20.00 (after split). Tempted? Let's take another bite at the new APPLE… Another Lodging REIT Hits the Street Apple Hospitality joins a long list of other Lodging REITs in REIT-dom. APLE's Total Capitalization is $3.98 billion, ranking the new public player in the middle of the pack. The Apple REITs have a long history of value creation in the hospitality sector - investing in over $9 billion of asset transactions since 1999. APLE's portfolio is one of the larger ones in the sector. The company has 173 hotels in 32 states. In addition, APLE's portfolio is younger than the others - APLE hotels have an average effective age of just 4 years. APLE has highly concentrated brand ownership: Hilton (47%) and Marriott (53%) are the only brands where APLE flies its banners. Within these two brands (Hilton and Marriott) APLE enjoys a diverse product offering that includes select service (63%), extended stay (30%), and full service (7%). Accordingly, APLE focuses on UPSCALE product line - lower RevPAR volatility and strong growth drive better risk adjusted returns. APLE has a diverse platform - investing in urban, high end suburban, and developing markets where diverse demand drivers and proximity to guest amenities generate strong, consistent performance. Tax code provisions governing REITs impose limitations on the income and activities of REITs that are at odds with hotel ownership and operation. Consequently, to qualify as a REIT all income must be derived from rents, interest, and mortgages (or real estate related activities). Because hotel operations don't meet that REAL ESTATE test, the typical hotel REIT leases the hotel assets to a separate entity that manages the hotel or hires a third party manager. The tenant may manage the hotels itself, or hire a property management firm to carry out some or all hotel operations. In addition, APLE has a relationship with a related entity, Apple REIT Ten, Inc., to perform management services for 53 hotels in the portfolio. In my initial review of APLE's portfolio we can see that the portfolio is "like new" with an average effective age of 4 years (includes new construction and renovations). As evidenced by the graph below, APLE has been consistently reinvesting in its portfolio: Consistent reinvestment provides for strong customer satisfaction and more predictable future capital needs. As a result, APLE has been an industry leader relative to its Tip Advisor rating (4.23 out of 5.00). APLE has one of the best efficiency scores overall - based on Adjusted Hotel EBITDA margin - second only to Chatham (NYSE: CLDT ) - a stock I own already (and adding more). Emphasis on higher operating margins provide more stable cash flow. Alternatively, APLE's focus on performance extends beyond G&A (lowest in the peer group) and into enhanced margins and profitability. Let's take a look at APLE's ADR (average daily rate) growth: Now let's take a look at APLE's occupancy growth: Now let's take a look at APLE's RevPAR growth: Now let's take a look at APLE's Adjusted EBITDA growth: This Is What I Really Like About Apple In APLE's Form 8-K the company said it entered into an amendment and restatement of its current credit facility, providing for a term loan of $212.5 million with a maturity date of May 18, 2020; a revolving credit facility of $540.0 million with an initial maturity date of May 18, 2019; and a $212.5 million delayed-draw term loan with a maturity date of May 18, 2020. With the amendment, the interest rate decreased slightly and, subject to certain exceptions, is equal to LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.50% to 2.30%, depending on the company's leverage ratio. As of March 31, 2015 APLE owned around $3.634 billion in Assets with just $650 million of Total Liabilities (of which $507 million is mortgage debt). Because of its conservatively structured balance sheet APLE has excellent access to capital markets - and one the safest balance sheets overall. 127 out of 173 of APLE's hotel are unencumbered. APLE has a well-staggered debt maturity profile: As of Q015 APLE's combined unrestricted cash and undrawn capacity on its revolving credit facility was $292 million. APLE pays an annual distribution of $0.68 per common share (pre-reverse split). As a publicly traded company, APLE has said that its Board intends to continue to pay distributions on a monthly basis. (I'll be adding APLE to my REITs That Pay Monthly Portfolio in my Forbes Real Estate Investor newsletter). On April 23rd APLE authorized monthly distributions at an annual rate of $1.20 (equivalent to $0.60 pre-reverse split) per common share. This new distribution rate will be payable effective with the planned June 15, 2015 distribution to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 29, 2015. APLE's yield (based on the market close yesterday) is 3.8%. I could not locate APLE's Modified FFO per share date; however, I found the Q1-15 MFFO results were $62.824 million and I divided the share count (186 million) and arrived at Q1-15 MFFO per share of $.34. As noted above, the current dividend payout is $.30 per share and the payout ratio is 88%. Given the wide margins generated and conservative capitalization, APLE's dividend payout appears in-line. In fact, I credit the management team for setting the payout rate at a level that can not only be sustained but be grown. Nothing gets me more frustrated than a REIT that lists with a ridiculously high dividend payout and later has to cut it down to size (think WHLR and CCG ). Before I provide you with my recommendation, let's take a look at the Apple Tree - that is, the Insider ownership that controls around 5.5% of the shares outstanding. The average tenure of the management team is over 13 years and the veteran team has deep roots in hotel investments. Also, I saw a few notable Board members: Jon Fosheim (co-founder of Green Street Advisors) and Daryl Nickel (former EVP of Lodging Development at Marriott International). Also, Hugh Redd is a Director (former CFO at General Dynamics). I have not seen any analyst research on APLE and this 4-hour research paper is my initial dive into the new REIT. First let me say that I'm glad that APLE has been able to withstand the media headlines and transact an all-important liquidity event. Given the drama over the years, non-traded REIT investors should be especially thankful that they can sell the previously illiquid shares or stay in the game. While every investor is unique, I would suggest that non-traded REIT investors ride this one out. The publicly-traded shares appear to be trading at a discount and based upon historical net asset valuation levels (and 3rd party reports). Using the back of the napkin FFO data (referenced above) I calculated APLE's P/FFO multiple (using run rate FFO per share of $.34 per quarter) and derived a value of 13.4x. That's not cheap but given the low leverage and significant cap-ex (reinvestment program) I believe APLE will easily hit its guidance for 2015 and shares will top $20.00 by year-end. The Bottom Line: I see value in Apple Hospitality and while the "bad apples" have now become a distant memory, the new REIT is well-capitalized to produce steady and predictable profits. I'm recommending an entry price at the current level $18.21 - but also maintaining limited exposure over the next 90 days. It's likely that many of the legacy non-traded REIT investors will be ready to sell shares and that could result in a more attractive entry price. As APLE gains more exposure and research coverage I believe the shares will move in line with the growth prospects. Don't let a few bad apples spoil this REIT… I'll take a slice of Mom's good ole' apple pie. Happy Memorial Day weekend! Source: SNL Financial and APLE Investor Presentation.
