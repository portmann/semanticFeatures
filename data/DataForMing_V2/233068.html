Apple Has Become A Trading Stock - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple mirrors the NASDAQ but in an exaggerated way. Apple is a one-trick pony. Other products don't move the needle. One of the better known aphorisms of 2015 is Jim Cramer's statement that "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is not a stock you trade, it's a stock you own." Is it? Over the last year, Apple is up 7.12%. Add in the dividend and you get a total yield of 9%. That doesn't sound too bad, except the gain in the NASDAQ over the last year comes to 9.73%. Your Apple stock is trailing the market average. Then, look at the pattern in Apple shares. While it generally moves in line with the market, the world's biggest company by market cap does so in an exaggerated fashion. While the averages were eking out modest gains early this year, Apple was on fire, rising several times to over $130/share. When the slump hit in August, Apple took it harder than the averages, dropping over $30/share in slightly more than a month. It has recovered since, but currently sits about 10% below its high for the year. All of which means that for an experienced trader there is money to be made. Taking an option on Apple while selling one against, say, the Dow would allow you to capture the Apple momentum with reduced downside risk. Options allow you to leverage your trade. You're less interested in the absolute movement of the underlying security than the speed of its move. You hedge that against the more stable index. Apple is a spread trader's best friend. As an investment, as a company to buy and hold, Apple today suffers a very basic problem. It's a one-trick pony. The iPhone is a very good trick, but no other product in its arsenal has anything like that momentum. CEO Tim Cook ridiculed PCs this week , apparently without realizing that the Macintosh is still a PC, even if it's running an Apple operating system. The biggest problem, literally, remains the iPad. Apple, with its software ecosystem, has simply failed to create an upgrade cycle for the product. Yet a tablet, with no moving parts, is quite durable. It is supposed to be a PC replacement, but the quality of the tools available for it is poor, and the on-screen keyboard is second-rate. Artists may like the iPad, but for a writer - someone who deals in text - it's practically worthless. Small wonder, then, that Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) stock has actually been on fire over the last few months, and that its gain for the last year actually exceeds that of Apple. Applications matter, content creation tools matter, and for those who deal in numbers and words, Windows remains the choice. Apple is still doing nothing in the cloud, with its iCloud still being basically a file storage system, and a high-priced clunky one at that. The Apple Watch may be a hit someday, but it's not moving the needle on volumes, especially when placed against the company as a whole. The same is true of Apple Music. The bigger a company gets, the more difficult growth gets. A hit has to be a mega hit to be noticeable, and Apple doesn't have any mega hits. No, you can trade Apple, but this has basically become a widows and orphans stock, and aggressive investors are abandoning it.
