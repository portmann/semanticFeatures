Apple: iPhone Split, Part 2 - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Reports suggest large iPhone builds for rest of 2016. Could the company launch three new iPhones? A couple of weeks ago, I detailed how it seemed like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) was getting ready to split its iPhone lineup . With reports suggesting that the company will provide different features for different new phone models, I suggested that this move could be well timed. Given the newest set of reports we have on the company's plans for the iPhone 7, Apple may do more than I originally was expecting. This week, we heard a report that suggested initial iPhone builds for the newest set of models is in a range of 72 million to 78 million units, well above a consensus of 65 million. The above range would imply roughly flat production over last year, while many on the street are calling for a decline in the mid to high single digits. Additionally, as the link above states, Apple could be launching three new models, the 7, the 7 Plus, and the 7 Pro/Premium. This would be an extra step from what I previously suggested, meaning Apple would essentially launch four new iPhone models this year when including the SE. If Apple does go this route with three models of the 7, it will be interesting to see the screen sizes. Do the Plus and Pro/Premium models have the same display size but just different features, or will the top of the line model be even larger? I've updated my potential price table from my previous article to add this extra phone to the picture. I did lower the cost of the entry level 7 by $50 here, as I think Apple will try to find a perfect price point balance. Especially in the US where the carrier environment has changed so much, I think the company will try to appeal to consumers who don't want to pay $30 a month for their phone. Additionally, an entry level new phone could appeal to international markets where incomes aren't substantial, but consumers still want an iPhone that has a screen larger than the SE. While I was hesitant to suggest this previously, going to three models would likely push at least one iPhone model above the $1,000 US starting point. Launching a more expensive, higher end model of the iPhone could also help the company to offset any margin pressures coming from the lower cost SE. Of course, Apple could offset some margin issues with increased volumes, so while gross margin percentages could decline slightly, the company could still see an increase in gross margin dollars. This would mean that the top of the line version would be extremely expensive around the globe in US dollar terms. Some markets see price differences of up to 150% or even more according to a recent article . The good news for Apple is that the US dollar has weakened off recent highs, so the company doesn't have to keep prices as high to combat currency movements. The chart below shows the trade weighted dollar index over the past year. (Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve research page ) The latest set of rumors regarding the iPhone 7 show initial builds well above expectations, along with a rumor that we could see three new models later this year. Whether or not a third model is launched, this builds upon my prior thesis that Apple will be looking to split its iPhone lineup. This will allow the company to provide key differences between models, other than just a larger screen size, allowing Apple to target consumers at a number of price points. Giving consumers the most options would seem to be a good strategy for a company looking to get iPhone sales going again.
