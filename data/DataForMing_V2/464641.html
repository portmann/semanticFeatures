Disney Is Not Overvalued - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha It has been stated recently that Disney is an overvalued or fully-valued stock. I think that, on the contrary, Disney is significantly undervalued. In an article I wrote in May about the Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS ), I wrote the following: At its current valuation of around $100 at a price-to-earnings ratio of 18.76, Disney offers a 1.41% dividend yield and a payout ratio of 25.40%...The company is offering an attractive price for prospective investors to start a position and for current investors to consider increasing their current one. Now, a little over two months later, there are analysts who believe that Disney is overvalued. Donald Thompson Jr. wrote a very good analysis of Disney, contending that fair value for Disney is $90 per share. The article: Disney - A Well Oiled Growth Machine , is worth your time, and while I disagree with Mr Thompson's conclusion on valuation, I respect where he is coming from and his assessment of the business largely agrees with my own. On June 20th, 2016, Stifel Nicolaus downgraded Disney to a 'Hold,' pointing to a split story, pointing on the one hand to a strong studio business and related consumer products business, and on the other hand to a media business which has a 'likely flat year' in F2017 to look forward to. Bizarrely, however, Stifel Nicolaus also said that Disney stock was presently fully valued, while also maintaining a target price of $110, which, as SA Editor Jason Aycock noted, would provide a 10.6% upside from its $99.47 closing price on June 19th. At present, Disney is trading in the $98-99 range with a price-to-earnings ratio of 18.31 and a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 16.13, offering a dividend yield of 1.43% and sustained by a low payout ratio of 25.05%. The dividend growth rate over the past five years was 35.25%, which makes up for the low dividend yield - and that dividend yield, combined with the low payout ratio, ensures that the likelihood of a dividend cut is equally low. Earnings per share over the past twelve months for Disney was $5.43, and the EPS growth rate over the next five years is estimated to be 10.01%, and increasing to 12.5% thereafter. Using a discount rate of 17.14%, which is the required rate of return on Disney's common stock, I calculate fair value for Disney's stock at $118.75 per share. The stock is undervalued by 17% at this time. Furthermore, Morningstar show that Disney's average five year P/E ratio is 19.3, which is above its current P/E ratio, indicating that the stock is currently undervalued. And it is trading at the lower end of its 52 week range of $86.25-$122.08. These factors lead me to believe that Disney is being offered at a good price, which is rare to find in the current stock market. So, with respect, I can only conclude that Disney is currently undervalued relative to its actual worth. The key reason for investing in Disney - its gargantuan intellectual property portfolio which makes it unassailable within the entertainment field - remains true, and will likely continue to be true for many decades to come. Investors wishing to avail of the profits that will accrue as a result will do well at present, I believe.
