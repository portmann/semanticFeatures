Will Verizon Really Grow In 2 Years? - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha VZ CEO said that next year will be rough, but the year after will produce growth. The $130 billion acquisition of Wireless set VZ back, and growth by 2017 will be very difficult. VZ will have to keep divesting wireline assets to fund acquisitions or investments, thereby decreasing the likelihood of growth in 2017. Verizon Communications' (NYSE: VZ ) executives are selling investors a very simple notion: "The next year or so will be tough, but after that your patience will be rewarded. So, bare with us." Given the fact that Verizon shares trade at just 11 times next year's expected earnings, investors might be willing to wait, especially if you've owned Verizon shares for many years and are concerned with capital gains tax and don't want to sacrifice that 5% dividend yield. Unfortunately, Verizon investors should remain very skeptical that 2017 will produce the "off to the races" free cash flow growth that CEO Lowell McAdam foresees. By divesting high margin wireline and FiOS broadband assets, refusing to expand internationally, and spending $130 billion for full ownership of Wireless , Verizon has essentially become a U.S. wireless company. Prior to that $130 billion acquisition, Verizon was much more diversified in both wireline and wireless businesses. Today, Verizon is betting its future on new mobile video services, advertising platforms and services to bolster its wireless business and increase data consumption. Verizon is less diversified today than it was before that acquisition and with over $110 billion in debt, there's a good chance that what Verizon is today, and what it will become in 2017, are much more aligned than what McAdam believes. After all, Verizon's debt limits the company's ability to make strategic investments or large company-changing acquisitions. Regardless of what McAdam or CFO Fran Shammo try to say , Verizon was forced to sell those wireline assets to Frontier (NASDAQ: FTR ) in order to afford the spectrum it won in the FCC's Auction 97. In the past, it could have used debt or free cash flow to cover the expenses. However, with debt rising 128.5% to $113.6 billion and free cash flow declining 35% to $8.1 billion since it spent $130 billion for full ownership of Wireless, those options for spending are no more. Here's the thing: Had Verizon's full ownership of Wireless had the intended outcome, then we would not be having this conversation. Verizon's full ownership was supposed to give the company more operating freedom, and drive free cash flow significantly higher. Unfortunately, Verizon did not foresee the wireless price wars that would then occur, sparked by T-Mobile (NYSE: TMUS ) and later Sprint (NYSE: S ). Notably, Sprint and T-Mobile are working hard to steal Verizon Wireless customers with unprecedented promotions, which has taken a toll on Verizon. In my opinion, Verizon would have never spent all that money for full ownership of Wireless had it anticipated the price war, the rise of leasing, and the extinction of two-year contracts. Therefore, investors should not give Verizon the benefit of the doubt that growth will return in 2017. In essence, it's easy to look ahead two years and predict that today's investments will result in free cash flow growth. However, rising interest rates, the devaluation of Verizon's wireless business, and the likely need to divest other wireline assets to fund future spectrum investments are all risks that must be weighed appropriately when looking ahead so far in the future. Not to mention, I have already explained my belief that this latest iPhone 6s, 6s Plus refresh cycle will unveil a slew of structural challenges for wireless companies. Most notably, there will be too much supply of older phones, not enough demand, and wireless companies like Verizon will be stuck trying to divest all that inventory at a big loss. With iPhones refreshed every year, this will be an ongoing, year-after-year problem. Lastly, with regard to Verizon and the future, investors cannot predict what destructive promotions that T-Mobile or Sprint may launch aimed at Verizon. While I ultimately believe that Sprint and T-Mobile are gaining new subscribers in an unprofitable manner, these promotions still affect Verizon and force its hand to enter promotions of its own. With over $9 billion a year in dividend obligations, Verizon is much more limited as to what it can offer customers versus the likes of T-Mobile and Sprint, thereby presenting another potential problem. The bottom line is that Verizon has too many questions that collectively don't appear to have a good answer. It all started with Verizon spending $130 billion to take full ownership of a U.S. wireless entity, an entity it already controlled. What we are seeing with Verizon is the aftermath of an enormous acquisition that has devalued quickly, and Verizon desperately trying to keep shareholders optimistic by looking ahead to the future. While Verizon does have the nation's best wireless network, AT&T (NYSE: T ) and Sprint are closing that gap fast , and it won't be long before the strengths of Verizon's network are so minimal that having the best network will no longer be a strong selling point for higher service prices. With that said, I know that Verizon pays a high yield and, yes, dividend and capital gain taxes are high. However, these noted questions suggest that Verizon will not achieve growth in two years and with too much debt on the balance sheet and all of Verizon's FCF being used on dividend payments, it will be forced to divest additional wireline assets to create capital. Albeit, Verizon may have a 5% yield, but that won't be enough downside protection if Verizon can't address these questions and find a way to reduce debt and increase free cash flow. Personally, I think that's much easier said than done. Disclosure: I am/we are long T. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
