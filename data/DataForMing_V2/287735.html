ETF Hub Jan 12 2016, 12:35 ET | About: AU Optronics Corp. (AUO) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor Focus Taiwan states "media reports" indicate Apple is planning to invest in AU Optronics ( AUO +3.9%) as part of its efforts to secure OLED supplies for future iPhones. AU (unsurprisingly) declined to comment. Korea's Economic Times  reported in late December Samsung and LG Display are close to OLED supply deals with Apple. A month before that, Japan's Nikkei reported Apple will launch iPhones sporting OLEDs in 2018. SA PRO author Esekla argued last month AU is an ideal OLED supply partner for Apple, and noted the company's long history of OLED-related R&D.
