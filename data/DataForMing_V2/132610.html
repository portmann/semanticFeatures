Disney Set For Further Upside On Expanded Product Portfolio - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Disney (NYSE: DIS ) is poised to continue its historic upward swing in the near future, ahead of its third quarter announcement on August 4. The company's efforts coupled with its increasingly diversified portfolio could spell out record growth for the next year and well beyond. Purchases in recent years of companies such as Marvel and Lucasfilm have given Disney a massive stable of well-known characters and brands to continue expanding its profit cycle. Now, with a diverse range of subsidiaries and fully owned companies, the company seems ready to reduce its dependence on main profit-center ESPN. Disney has been on the rise for the better part of a decade, a trend that has shown little sign of slowing. Recently, the company announced that it would be increasing its dividend by 15%, a massive expansion considering the company had announced a 34% hike as recently as December. Despite the dividend yield still being a relatively low 1.15%, dividend payments have increased to $1.32 per share. The most impressive aspect of this is that the company could continue to push this number higher, as it is on pace for close to an impressive $6 billion in free cash flow for fiscal 2015. Disney is poised for box office and market dominance for the next half decade, with high profile releases forthcoming from all of its major studios. In the pipeline are Marvel Studios' "Phase 3" slate scheduled for releases every year until 2020, Lucasfilm's highly profitable "Star Wars" franchise is set to release the long-awaited next episode in the series in December 2015, and Pixar is set to launch two films in the same year for the first time ever. When coupled with their own Disney studios, set to film and release live-action reboots or versions of popular legacy brands in the next three years, the company could see an impressive run for the next half-decade. This intense release schedule spells profits not only for Disney's Media division, but also for their booming theme park, cruise line, and resort business, as well as for licensing and consumer products division. This quarter alone, Marvel has already seen excellent returns from two Marvel movies ("Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron", "Ant-Man") and Pixar's "Inside Out". All three films have been box-office leaders and all three of which have opened at #1 in the box office (Ant-Man and Inside Out currently hold 1st and 4th at the box office). Despite these positive signs for the outlook, there is slight cause for concern about Disney's future. As of now, Disney is heavily reliant on the revenue generated by its cable channels, especially ESPN; this sector alone accounts for 56% of the company's total profits. By comparison, even Disney's movie division, which is experiencing an historic boom, still only accounts for approximately 12% of the company's profits. While the sports network and its offshoots prove an unrivaled force in the television world, the cable industry is facing a period of serious uncertainty on several fronts. The traditional subscription model of cable is quickly being rendered obsolete by streaming services. Although ESPN could counter shifting viewership trends by switching to a more user flexible delivery service, many people would not be willing to pay the higher subscription fees required. Even now, while the network still increases its subscription fee yearly, it has started to see a slight drop in viewership numbers. This past year has already seen ESPN drop 3.2 million subscribers, which translated to a 4% shrinkage in profits. Another big concern is the cyclical nature of their resort, theme park, and cruise line business. While the past five years have seen the division recover admirably after the recession, the capital intensive nature of the business, and the natural boom-bust cycle of this business means that the continued growth of this sector could see a sharp drop-off in the near future. Regardless of these potential pitfalls, Disney's stock has continued to increase for the last five years, showing no signs of slowing down and even reaching historic levels. The company's share prices have already climbed by 26.36% year-to-date after recording 2014 growth of 23.75%. There is little to show that this trend will reverse in the coming year. The company's earnings-per-share have grown year over year by 14% and the upcoming earnings report is expected to again show strong growth overall, despite some divisions within the company slightly under-producing especially Disney Interactive, the company's video game and electronic entertainment division. From a valuation perspective the company might seem a little rich considering the current price-to-earnings multiple of 25.53 and a dividend yield of 1.11%. However, the stock nevertheless presents excellent opportunities for longer-term income and value investors owing to its strong growth potential and increased focus on diversification away from core products like ESPN. If the company continues to experience success thanks to its string of acquisitions and upcoming releases, there is nothing preventing shares from rising to between $125-130 by year end if the positive trajectory holds. While not necessarily an attractive buying point at present owing to seasonality and shares trading near record highs, pullbacks should be used to take positions or add to existing long positions to take advantage of Disney's potential. Overall, the company seems to be on stable footing, although that could change if ESPN continues to see subscribers run for the door, and if they fail to diversify their revenue sources. However, if the company can translate its potential for box-office and licensing dominance in the coming years into a larger share of the earnings pie, Disney could be a solid stock that produces dividends at a comfortable rate with plans to begin paying out dividends semi-annually. The gains in Disney and strong outlook make these shares a solid component of any long-term portfolio strategy.
