ETF Hub Apr 17 2015, 21:13 ET | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor A spokesperson for ESPN (NYSE: DIS ) has weighed in on reports that Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) will offer unbundled or "skinny" packages to give customers choice about what they receive -- and ESPN says that's not allowed . “Media reports about Verizon’s new contemplated bundles describe packages that would not be authorized by our existing agreements," says the company's statement. "Among other issues, our contracts clearly provide that neither ESPN nor ESPN2 may be distributed in a separate sports package.” The move's unsurprising coming from ESPN, which charges the highest prices per subscriber by far among national cable peers, reportedly now more than $6/month. That compares with TNT at around $1.48/subscriber month. ESPN has made defending bundles a policy priority in Washington, and companies with powerful bundles of channels like Disney (with the various flavors of ESPN as well as the Disney Channel and Soapnet) can force channels with low or no consumer interest into bundles with the desired flagship stations to build their audience. The statement suggests Verizon didn't get a sign-off from Disney before talking about unbundling, though Peter Kafka reports that Verizon's Alberto Canal said the company had gotten authorization from all programmers in its new bundle. Well yeah.  The content providers love the ability to force a purchase of channels that wouldn't survive on their own (because they are just plain lousy or too narrow in focus).  That's why a la carte will have a hard time becoming reality.  There's too much money to be made by bundling. Agreed but at some point they will realize that they are selling buggy whips.  The market has moved on and they are left in the past.  A la carte would have been good for them in the long run. I "a la carte" every day. Canceled cable. Bought two smart TVs. and have on demand selection of nearly  anything I want except live sports. And that is the white elephant in the room. This is a growing trend that is quietly building momentum while traditional content providers sit and haggle samtics. Kudos! My wife and I did the same thing several years ago. We got tired of paying for channels we did not watch and garbage programming from the networks. We also own smart TVs and choose what we want to watch and when from Netflix. We are not sports fans so we particularly never missed those channels. I already have the minimal fios TV plan which doesn't include ESPN. Next step dump that too once the contract expires This is why my generation won't have cable. I haven't had a pay TV package in 6+ years. Why should I? I have Netflix and can find any other TV show I need to watch online quite easily. ETF Performance: View ETF performance across key asset classes and investing themes
