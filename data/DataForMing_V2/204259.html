Bet With Buffett, Buy Boeing - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Buffett's purchases of PCP is really a bet on aerospace, and investors can bet alongside him by purchasing BA, which is only 15.6x earnings. BA's backlog provides several years of revenue visibility, and increasing deliveries should support margins. While defense will remain pressured, margins have stabilized, and the worst is probably in the rear view mirror. Several weeks ago, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.B ) announced it was buying Precision Castparts (NYSE: PCP ) for $37 billion. While PCP does provide some products for the oil and gas sector, they key driver of its business is aerospace, which accounts for about 72% of its revenue . While oil and gas has gotten a lot of the headlines, Buffett is really betting on aerospace, and he is paying handsomely to get it, around 22x 2015 earnings and 12x EBITDA. Even if we bumped up some of PCP's non-aerospace business to adjust for the weak activity in the energy sector, Buffett is paying north of 18-19x 2015 earnings. If you like Buffett and I feel optimistic about aerospace's fundamentals, I would suggest you just buy industry leader Boeing (NYSE: BA ) at a comparably cheap 15.6x earnings (I expect the company to earn around $8.40 this year after adjusting for one-time items). Boeing is well positioned to benefit from the commercial aerospace upgrade cycle thanks to its leading product portfolio including the Dreamliner and upgraded 777. Demand for these planes has been absolutely tremendous, giving the company unprecedented and unparalleled revenue visibility. Boeing's backlog stood at an amazing $489 billion at the end of Q2 . Boeing can basically run its factories at full capacity through 2020 just on the orders it has booked to this point. Now, airlines can cancel orders, but Boeing is still seeing net orders as seen by last quarter's $18 billion in orders. While I expect to see Boeing's backlog to shrink a bit over the next 12-18 months as the company executes on its backlog and sees deliveries exceed new orders, all signs point to new orders remaining positive. In all likelihood, Boeing will be able to operate at capacity for seven years based on the backlog it has built and modest new orders. Importantly, Boeing's key customers, the airlines, continue to report solid results, and after the latest rounds of consolidation, competition has become more manageable. The rash of bankruptcies that clouded last decade is unlikely to repeat this decade. Also unlike PCP, Boeing is an indirect beneficiary of low oil prices. Low oil prices are helping the airlines make even more money, further diminishing bankruptcy risk as fuel is a major input cost. Additionally while everyone is worrying about how fast China is growing, the emerging markets are poised to grow over the medium term with more people entering the middle class every day. Thinking beyond the volatility of the next few weeks, this will only help the demand for aircraft. Betting on aerospace is a bet on global growth, which is a bet guys like Buffett have successfully implemented for years. At the same time, Boeing has been adding capacity at its facilities to churn out more planes, and we are seeing the results of that effort. Commercial deliveries are running 11% above last year at 381 planes. As Boeing scales its Dreamliner program in the coming 12 months and boosts output, it should also see operating margins expand a bit, which will make its backlog even more profitable. Boeing has a locked-in revenue stream, and as it builds scale, it should push margins another 50-100bp higher, boosting profits at a faster clip. Now like PCP with oil, Boeing has been stuck with a weak business, its defense unit, which has struggled due to tight federal spending. However, most of the sequester's bite is already in results, and a new President could bring about a new fiscal and defense policy, particularly with Russia and China having assertive foreign policies. Boeing has worked to cut costs in this unit to bring it in-line with lower defense spending, and we are seeing the results of this effort. Thus far in 2015, operating margins have risen 0.2% even as revenue fell 7%. While I don't see this business being a source of growth, the worst of the declines from a profit standpoint are likely in the rearview mirror. Finally, Boeing has a fantastic balance sheet and cash flow. Boeing should generate around $9-9.5 billion in operating cash flow and $6-$6.5 billion in free cash flow (defined as operating cash flow less cap-ex). Boeing has been returning this cash to shareholders, paying a $600 million quarterly dividend and repurchasing $2 billion in stock in Q2. The company has about $7.5 billion remaining on its repurchase authorization, which I expect to last to the end of 2016, implying a $1.25 billion per quarter pace. Boeing is essentially returning all of its free cash flow to shareholders, which it can easily afford to do. After all, the company has $9.6 billion in cash against $9 billion in debt. Boeing should continue to return cash to shareholders, and I would look for the company to raise its dividend yet again this December as has become the norm. Over the past decades, it has often been wise to bet with Warren Buffett. With his purchase of PCP, Buffett is betting on aerospace. Now after its recent pullback, BA is trading at a sizable discount to the PCP purchase price, giving investors a chance to buy an industry leader at an attractive price. With its large backlog and a healthy airline industry, Boeing has visible revenue, and continued investment in its supply chain and capacity should help margins and plane deliveries. If Boeing moves towards the 18x Buffett is paying for PCP (normalizing for fluctuations in the oil business), shares could move back past $150. I would follow Buffett's lead by buying Boeing down in the low $130's. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
