Intel Versus Qualcomm: Who's The Chip Champ Going Forward? - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Qualcomm is fabless while Intel spends $10B per year on CAPEX. For decades Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) has been the heavyweight champion of the computer CPU market. Starting with the IBM (NYSE: IBM ) PC and continuing through today Intel has dominated what I call the "immobile" market and has an enviable record of vanquishing competitors such as AMD (NASDAQ: AMD ). But in the new world of mobile new competitors have shown up and in some cases have vanquished the previous indomitable champion. Perhaps the most competitive has been Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ). In this article I compare Intel with Qualcomm and see if the capo di capo of the CPU neighborhood will still be the dominate player going forward. Qualcomm's concentration on mobile markets puts it in the most dynamic and fastest growing chip markets. Its Snapdragon line of ARM chips commands the mobile phone market with over 1 billion android phones shipped with Snapdragon. It also dominates the LTE modem business a market where Intel has only a 1% share. Intel on the other hand recently announced that Q1 sales would be down approximately $1B because of "weaker than expected demand for business desktop PCs and lower than expected inventory levels across the PC supply chain" For Intel, desktop CPU's represent the largest and most profitable product line roughly 62% of sales ($35B of $56B total) and 66% of Operating profit. If you include Intel's mobile chip "contra-revenue" fiasco it's an even higher percentage. So when the PC Client Group sneezes Intel gets pneumonia. Thus Intel is overly dependent on the stagnant market for desktop PC's. Advantage: QCOM with profitable sales in growth markets their sales are likely to grow faster than INTC. Both Intel and Qualcomm are entering each other's markets. Intel is trying to manufacture competitive LTE modems but so far has had little success per the above chart. This is a brutal market with both Texas Instruments and Broadcom dropping out of the modem market due to losses. Intel competes more successfully with Qualcomm in the tablet market although only with $10B in contra-revenue losses. Whether Intel will ever make a significant profit in the tablet market is still a very big question mark. Meantime, Qualcomm has announced a new server chip aimed directly at Intel's other long time profit center server chips. Its Data Center Group generated more than $5 B in profit in 2014 up 15% from 2013. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) has already ported Windows server to ARM processors and if that becomes permanent then this is another high-margin Intel product that will come under attack. Even without the Windows port a QCOM server chip will steal sales from Intel in the Linux server market which is 2/3 of server sales. Advantage: QCOM with entry into the high sales price, high margin server chip market QCOM may be the first real competitor to INTC's hugely successful Data Center Group. INTC on the other hand must somehow make contra-revenue go away before it can make money in QCOM's market. Intel's huge CAPEX versus Qualcomm's fabless production Intel invests huge amounts of money for CAPEX and R&D. In 2014 it was over $20B combined. QCOM on the other hand outsources production to almost a dozen different manufacturers while maintaining a similar percentage of sales for R&D. QCOM believes this approach is less risky and preserves cash for things other than CAPEX. As QCOM CEO Steve Mollenkopf said at the analysts day in November: "But that is not the only edge that Qualcomm has. As the company's top brass pointed out at its analyst day this week, it will manufacture about 4.5 billion chips in 2014, and it has relationships with 11 different foundries - Samsung, TSMC, GlobalFoundries, SMIC, UMC, Amkor, ASE Group. SPIL, StatsChipPAC, and UTAC - using over 15 different process technologies." Advantage: QCOM although for the very latest technology INTC has an advantage but they must turn that advantage into profits. In this chart we can see the dramatic increase in revenues for QCOM vs. INTC. Of course INTC was starting at a much higher level and would not be expected to have sales increases as high as a smaller competitor. Advantage: QCOM faster sales growth should result in more R&D dollars and more rapid stock price appreciation. INTC may be able to turn their IP into more profits but the question is when and by how much. Intel is famous for its R&D spending but QCOM exceeds it Intel is known for spending huge amounts on Research and Development and does that to maintain its lead in IP and the latest technology for producing the best chips. However, as the following chart shows QCOM is also an aggressive R&D spender which is why it is able to maintain its lead in several mobile markets. Advantage: neither. Looks like a neck and neck horse race to me. When it comes to gross margin QCOM is the leader Intel rightly brags about its concentration on gross margin and over the years has managed to keep it high enough to fund its huge CAPEX and R&D budget. But as you can clearly see on the following chart QCOM has done even better over the last few years and in addition does not have to fund a huge CAPEX budget. However the chart also shows INTC exceeding QCOM's margin in 2014 and also shows QCOM's margin has been consistently shrinking. One reason QCOM's margins are high is its high level of licensing revenue a source that needs R&D but not expensive fabs. Note: Source of all charts marketwatch data, author design. Advantage: Neither. Looks too close to call but QCOM needs to get their margins back up. When it comes to Mr. Market QCOM is much better liked Over the last 5-year time period QCOM shares have outperformed INTC by a large margin. In fact INTC is below the Dow Jones Semi-conductor Index for the same period while QCOM has marginally exceeded it. PE ratios are close at 14x for QCOM and 13X for INTC. Both also pay good dividends at 2.78% and 3% respectively and both are paying out about 40% of earnings in dividends. Intel is more reliant on older product lines (desktop and server chips) for their profits than QCOM. Certainly desktops are vulnerable to slow downs (as the first quarter showed) and INTC is betting big on 3D NAND and an end to contra-revenue to fuel a profit turnaround. Their chances in the modem market seem slim to me and I don't think anything is going to match the margins they have historically seen in desktops and servers. One area with potentially big sales and margins is 3D NAND but it will most likely be 2017 before the volume is enough to make a real difference. QCOM on the other hand is also facing new competition with Samsung threatening to go with their own chip (the Exynos) for new phones. This would cut out a large portion of Snapdragon sales. But QCOM is in all the new markets and I think has an advantage over Intel everywhere but in the traditional Intel markets although it may soon be knocking on Intel's door with their new server line. If MSFT ports Windows to ARM processors then I think QCOM will thrive taking market share from INTC. I would not rate either QCOM or INTC a buy at this point but if COM's price falls under $60 or INTC's under $30 then I would reconsider. One could easily argue that Micron (NASDAQ: MU ) with a PE of 8 is the best positioned since they will sell memory to both chip giants markets as well as Apple's and maybe Samsung's. And of course if Intel is successful in 3D NAND then Micron will be also as the Joint Venture partner of Intel. Source: Intel Versus Qualcomm: Who's The Chip Champ Going Forward?
