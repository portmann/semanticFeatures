In an otherwise dreary manufacturing recession landscape, one in which even the services sector is getting increasingly more troubled by the day, and where nothing the Fed says or does can keep animal spirits inflated, there was one ray of light: the one company that benefits from over a billion people posting pictures of their dogs or stalking their significant other's best friend: Facebook. Moments ago Mark Zuckerberg's social network reported that in Q4 it generated $5.84 billion in revenue, far higher than the $5.37 billion expected... ... driven entirely by an ongoing surge in mobile users. Indeed, of the 1.038 billion DAU at Dec. 31... ... over 90%, or 934 million, were mobile, an increase of 25%.  As the company notes, mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 80% of advertising revenue, up from 69% in Q4 2014. Even more impressive is that somehow, nearly 1.6 billion people 1.6, or about a quarter of the world's entire population, supposedly visits Facebook at least once a month. Furthermore, Facebook represents that over 60% of the total US and Canada population - this includes tens of millions of children and eldery - is a monthly Facebook user. We are a little sceptical about this, but surely the management team would never lie. Another notable chart is the number of monthly only users which rose by almost 100 million in the past quarter rising to 823 million, or about 80% of total. Mobile advertising revenue - Mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 80% of advertising revenue for the fourth quarter of 2015, up from 69% of advertising revenue in the fourth quarter of 2014. Capital expenditures - Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter of 2015 were $692 million. Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities - Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $18.43 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of 2015. Revenue - Revenue for the full year 2015 was $17.93 billion, an increase of 44% year-over-year. Income from operations - Income from operations for the full year 2015 was $6.23 billion. Net income - Net income for the full year 2015 was $3.69 billion. Free cash flow - Free cash flow for the full year 2015 was $6.08 billion. Daily active users (DAUs) - DAUs were 1.04 billion on average for December 2015, an increase of 17% year-over-year. Mobile DAUs - Mobile DAUs were 934 million on average for December 2015, an increase of 25% year-over-year. Monthly active users (MAUs) - MAUs were 1.59 billion as of December 31, 2015, an increase of 14% year-over-year. Mobile MAUs - Mobile MAUs were 1.44 billion as of December 31, 2015, an increase of 21% year-over-year.

I have collegues that work with FB and paying customers.  FB is adament that their analysts are the only ones that get to research the data on campaign effectiveness.

Wed, 01/27/2016 - 17:14 | 7105321 Sudden Debt In october I had a arguement with my sister in law because the idiot found that I didn't like her posts enough and that it meanth I was the bad part of the family. There's a shitload of mentaly unstable people who only have a facebook world. Where reposting pictures of a cat, or a skinny person they mock when they themselves are fat, or tell how other people should live or why they themselves are on the moral highground... They live in such a fantasy land, that the looney house will be their final destination when they realize all their friends are fiat. Wed, 01/27/2016 - 17:18 | 7105353 besnook facebook will be outed as a fraud any minute now. kids aren't into the fuckerberg scam and long time users aren't using it as often as they used to so where are these numbers coming from? ghostbookers? Wed, 01/27/2016 - 17:19 | 7105354 moonmac Iâ€™ll agree to only become a millionaire instead of a billionaire by paying $50 to everyone who dumps Facebook for my social media site. Americans would turn in their own mother for $50. Who wants to invest? Wed, 01/27/2016 - 17:29 | 7105405 RealistDuJour BUT BUT BUT FANG??!?  Maybe Zero can pull a CPI "Adjustment" like manouevre and selectively delete this data piece that doesn't follow a narrative, and turn it into NAG.  Although as much as all the FANG crap that has been posted... I don't know how much NAGging I could take.  Enough of that happens at home as it is. Wed, 01/27/2016 - 17:30 | 7105417 2thepeople I have never been on FB, but i do spend an hour or so on ZH a day. And my avatar isn't a true representation of myself ( i'm not actually a dog). Does that make me a bad person?? Wed, 01/27/2016 - 17:41 | 7105481 smacker 1.6 billion users per month, there are 7 billion people in the world, that would mean close to every human being who has internet access uses facefuck. BULLSHIT!!! let me tell everyone everytime i go to the gym, how much i run, where i am going on vacation, what i am having for dinner, really freaking sad. people who use it need to re evaluate there lives. Wed, 01/27/2016 - 18:04 | 7105621 Proaurum Revenues/profits for FB shareholders may be a good or bad thing depending on what the figures are, but for the economy in general? Revenue for FB is revenue that doesn't make it to some other company. It's a zero sum game as far as advertising is concerned.  You also have to ask how useful online advertising is to the companies that pay for it. It is after all a cost that eats into their own profits. Bottom line is FB and similar companies are non-productive and do not in themeselves generate wealth for the woder economy. True wealth generation is via mineral or raw material extraction, processing and adding value up teh supply chain, and we know where all that is heading... Wed, 01/27/2016 - 18:44 | 7105681 Anopheles Well folks, there's only ONE POT of advertising dollars, and it's relatively fixed.  That means most of those rosy projections of increased advertising dollars are NOT going to work out.  Facebook's P/E is currently 95.  So, what's going to happen?  Will their revenue increase by 5+ times?  or is their stock price going to drop?   Apple's P/E is 10  and Google's is 30  Also, companies are finding out that the millions of dollars they spend for online advertising is NOT working out very well at all.  Their click to sales conversion ratio is terrible.  Wed, 01/27/2016 - 19:00 | 7105870 jamochavez Agreed on the pot of dollars for advertising. And guessing if you could figure out what all these companies valuations infer how much advertising g dollars there are there would be some insanely high amount over what actually there is. Not to mention looks like advertising total dollars are more likely receding Wed, 01/27/2016 - 18:22 | 7105704 Hal n back I recently opemned a facebook account and have been innundated with e mails listing peopl eI may know--its one big spiderweb. A frend of a friend etc. Wed, 01/27/2016 - 18:39 | 7105784 smacker Same crap happened to me when I opened a FB account. I got so fed up with it I haven't even logged in for nearly three years. Wed, 01/27/2016 - 18:37 | 7105773 yellowsub Wed, 01/27/2016 - 19:17 | 7105929 thismarketisrigged Wed, 01/27/2016 - 19:44 | 7106079 TrustbutVerify Wed, 01/27/2016 - 20:25 | 7106276 adr I'm sure since my tablet, phone, two TVs, desktop computer, laptop, game console, blu ray player, etc all have connections to Facebook, each of them are counted as active users whether I connect to Facebook or not. Every single phone has multiple direct links to Facebook for photos, web posts, and messaging. If you have a Google account, Apple account, or any web based email, it connects in some way to Facebook. It takes hours to delete all of the links to Facebook and clear out your registry. Most people don't care and Fuckerberg and his kin know it. Every time a new phone is turned on Facebook counts a new user. Also Facebook doesn't work in China. Nobody in China uses Facebook. If Sandycrotchberg says they have mobile users in China, it is a total lie. Some people I know in China would like to use it, but they aren't willing to risk the government coming down on them for using a VPN. As with most public corporations the numbers are complete bullshit, but Facebook is a greater work of fiction than all of Hollywood's history combined.
