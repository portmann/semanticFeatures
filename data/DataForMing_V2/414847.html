Applied Materials May Profit From Apple's Overseas Cash - Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) | Seeking Alpha As of its latest earnings report, Applied Materials has suddenly become a growth stock, with orders up 37% y/y. The main growth came in the Display segment, with an influx of orders for equipment to manufacture OLED screens for mobile devices. For Applied Materials' (NASDAQ: AMAT ) fiscal Q1, which ended in January, I characterized the company as a safe, though not exciting investment . For fiscal Q2, the story has changed dramatically. Suddenly, AMAT is all about growth. AMAT appears to have acquired a customer with the deepest pockets around, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). AMAT's results for its fiscal Q2 , ended May 1, were in line with expectations and nothing to write home about in terms of growth. Revenue was flat y/y at $2.45 billion, and operating income was $425 million, up 2% y/y. Just another boring quarter for this maker of equipment for manufacturing microprocessors, memory, and displays. Or it would have been except that new orders jumped 37% y/y to $3.451 billion. A breakdown of new orders shows where the action was. AMAT's largest segment is Silicon Systems, which posted a very healthy 15% y/y gain in orders to $1.966 billion. Silicon is naturally the biggest segment in terms of revenue, at $1.587 billion for the quarter. The Display segment new orders erupted for a volcanic 483% y/y increase to $700 million. In his prepared remarks, CEO Gary Dickerson stated: In display, I'm increasingly excited about our opportunities and the unique position we have in this market. The major technology inflections that are taking place require materials innovation so our available market is expanding significantly. One great example of this is thin film encapsulation that protects an OLED device from air and moisture. The precision deposition of this film stack is incredibly challenging, and relies on Applied advanced materials engineering capabilities. Overall, we estimate that our opportunity in OLED is more than three times larger than for traditional LCD. I believe we're still in a very early innings of OLED but we're already seeing a significant impact on our business. This quarter our orders in display were an all-time record. During the conference call, analysts probed this development extensively, but didn't get much more color. About all AMAT management would say was that the new display orders were about 70% for OLED screens for mobile applications. The tech media routinely characterize OLED displays as superior to LCD displays because they provide deeper more saturated colors, brighter pixels, and are more electrically efficient. In a previous article I pointed out that OLED has some drawbacks in terms of lifetime and display uniformity. Also, they are not actually more efficient than LCD when the display is showing a mostly white or light colored background, such as when reading text. Despite the drawbacks, OLED displays continue to win rave reviews from display experts such as Dr. Raymond Soneira, and it's clear that they are popular with consumers. For mobile applications, the advantage of OLED is that the displays are lighter and thinner, potentially allowing for a thinner device. From the surge in OLED related orders, it's clear that the mobile device industry is transitioning rapidly to OLED. The conference call didn't shed much light on who the customers are, but Bloomberg's report on AMAT contained this quote from Dickerson: It's not a peak or a one-time event. This is going to be sustainable growth. We all know who is the leader in terms of mobile products. The Bloomberg article and accompanying video took the last sentence and ran with it as referring to Apple. In fact the whole report was spun as an Apple focused report. Likewise, Apple fansites such as Apple Insider took this as certain confirmation of the numerous rumors that Apple's 2017 iPhone (8 or 7s?) will feature an OLED screen. I'm not absolutely convinced that Dickerson had Apple in mind. Many of my friends in the Android camp might take issue with the presumption of Apple leadership. But the suddenness and size of the Display order growth does suggest a new player arriving on the scene. A player with deep pockets, and a rather sudden interest in OLED screen fabrication. Furthermore, the sheer volume and persistence of rumors concerning OLED for iPhone indicates that this change is likely some time in the near future. (By the way, I believe the above concept for an edge-to-edge OLED screen is technically unfeasible. The concept shows holes cut in the display for the home button and the earpiece. OLED screens have electrical lines running horizontally and vertically in order to address each pixel, and cutting holes in the display would disrupt these and cause large regions of the display to be blank.) How would Apple go about making this transition? One way would be for Apple to simply buy OLED displays from Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) or LG. Then it would be the supplier spending Apple's money at AMAT to expand production to accommodate Apple. This would make sense except for a few considerations. The first is that Apple wants to reduce its dependence on suppliers who are also major competitors, which is certainly true of Samsung, and of LG to a lesser extent. There's just too much built in conflict of interest, and too much potential for Apple trade secrets to leak out of the supplier performing organization and into the rest of the supplier company, to Apple's detriment. Apple's ability to enforce non-disclosure agreements is very limited if the information leaks are internal to the supplier. How would Apple even find out? The other consideration is the recent purchase of Sharp (a major supplier of Apple product displays) by Foxconn. I believe the evidence is strong that Apple had a hand in this . At the very least, I don't think Foxconn would have bothered with Sharp without the assurance of a significant revenue stream from Apple. So the pieces of the puzzle seem to be that Apple sponsors (instigates, cajoles) Foxconn to buy Sharp, and then suddenly AMAT has a big influx of orders for OLED production equipment. Upgrading Sharp for what many regard as the future of display technology (for the next 5-10 years), was probably in the plans for Sharp from the beginning, as I indicated in the Sharp article. The final piece of the puzzle is that the whole scenario of buying Sharp and upgrading its capability provides Apple with a productive use of some of its overseas cash without having to repatriate it. The only legal detail that remains unclear is whether Apple's Irish wholly owned subsidiary, which holds the cash, would be able to make purchases directly from AMAT. Equipment purchases might have to be made by Foxconn. The growth in display orders, combined with AMAT's dominant position in display manufacturing equipment now makes AMAT a buy, with or without Apple. If Apple's involvement (even indirect) can be confirmed, so much the better for AMAT. AMAT acquires a customer/partner with a lot of money to spend and multiple motivations to spend it. In addition to displays, Apple also has very strong motives to accelerate adoption of the next process node at 10 nm. Samsung recently announced that it was going to begin ramping 10 nm production by the end of this year , throwing down the gauntlet for the entire semiconductor industry. AMAT made clear that most new orders for the Silicon Systems segment are related to 10-7 nm production. So the race is on for 10 nm. Apple has partnered with TSMC (NYSE: TSM ), once again avoiding Samsung for the foreseeable future, so Apple will naturally want to accelerate 10 nm deployment at TSMC as well. If Samsung makes good on its promise, and the rest of the major foundries such as TSMC follow suit, it will mark an important milestone in the semiconductor industry. The torch of technology leadership will have passed to a new generation of tech companies, the mobile generation. That mobile generation can literally spend billions shopping at AMAT.
