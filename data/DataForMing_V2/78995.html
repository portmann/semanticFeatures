ETF Hub Jun  6 2015, 16:08 ET | About: Apple Inc.

Until now, attempts by mobile operators and banks to get mobile payments running in Britain have failed amid industry infighting and consumer indifference. The iPhone accounts for more than 40% of smartphones sold in the U.K., and owners tend to be big-spending consumers. Most UK banks already have Contactless payment cards which are fast to use. The majority of UK users have more than one card and it's easier and faster to choose which card to use rather than having to check which account your iPhone is set to and changing it if necessary. It might take off to an extent but I'm guessing that, like America, people try it once and then go back to what they used previously. I believe those are debit cards or pre-paid top-up cash cards only.  They have been popular for the last decade or more - a lifesaver for not having to mess with small changes on public transit or the convenient stores.

"It might take off to an extent but I'm guessing that, like America, people try it once and then go back to what they used previously." Is this true?  I always use apple pay, but it isn't always offered.  So for now I have to carry a wallet and a phone.  It reminds me of when the US (NorthEast) started with EZ Pass.  It took me years to not panic, thinking the bar won't raise and I will be stuck blocking a lane.  Now the bars are gone, and no one doubts EZ pass.  Give it time.
