UPDATE 1-UAW launches strike at auto supplier Nexteer's U.S. operations | Reuters DETROIT Dec 8 Union workers at Nexteer Automotive Group Ltd's plant in Saginaw, Michigan, walked off the job early Tuesday after rejecting a proposed contract, halting production of steering systems and other components essential to vehicle production by General Motors Co  and other automakers. United Auto Workers union Local 699 announced the strike on its Facebook page shortly after midnight on Tuesday. The action came after workers at the Saginaw factory on Sunday voted down a proposed contract by a wide margin. Local 699 leaders posted a tally sheet of the vote on Facebook. GM and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV  said in statements Tuesday they are monitoring the situation at Nexteer. GM said its production had not been disrupted "at this point." FCA said Nexteer supplies parts to several of its North American factories. Ford Motor Co  said in a statement that Nexteer's Saginaw facility "does not directly support any Ford operations in North America," and that Ford is looking into any potential impact through its supply chain. Nexteer, controlled by a unit of Aviation Industry Corp of China, was formerly part of GM, and remains a major supplier of steering systems and related hardware to the Detroit automaker. Nexteer supplies steering systems for GM's profitable large Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks. "We are trying to resolve this as quickly as possible," Nexteer spokesman Luis Canales said in an interview on Tuesday. A spokesman for UAW leadership in Detroit did not have an immediate comment. Officials at Local 699 could not be reached.
