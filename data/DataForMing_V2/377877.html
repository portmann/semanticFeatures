A Case Study On Large-Cap Value Investing | Seeking Alpha Large-cap value investing requires a different set of search tools, focusing on fear rather than neglect. I use Apple as a case study for large-cap value investing and low ex-net cash earnings multiple stocks. I found 40 large-cap stocks whose share prices declined by over 30% in the past 52-week period and currently trading at no more than 15% above their 52-week lows. In my previous article titled "How Benjamin Graham Will Possibly Invest In A World Without Net-Nets," I suggested a couple of deep value investment alternatives such as net cash stocks, low P/B stocks and Asian net-nets that could potentially substitute for U.S. net-nets. This is particularly relevant for large-cap investors who are unlikely to have any opportunity to invest in any U.S. net-net meeting their market capitalization and trading liquidity requirements. There are two broad categories of value investing opportunities, the first a result of neglect, the second driven by fear. Net-nets tend to fall in the former category, as they are usually micro-cap stocks with limited liquidity and investor interest. In the latter category, investors are more likely to find large-cap fallen angels where institutional investors have taken the lead in dumping the stocks due to short-term concerns and fears. While it is much more difficult to find large-cap stocks being cheap on an absolute basis (e.g. net-nets, P/E under 5 times, EV/EBIT under 3 etc), there always are large-cap stocks attractively priced on a relative basis. These opportunities include stocks in the lowest P/B and EV/EBIT (more or less equivalent to being cheap on an ex-net cash basis) deciles of the market and the 52-week lows list. In the section below, I present an actual case study of a deep value/wide moat large-cap stock trading at a single-digit ex-cash P/E multiple which a fund manager profited from. Jim Roumell is one of the deep value investors I follow closely. Prior to starting Roumell Asset Management in 1998, he was a Registered Principal at Raymond James Financial Services, Inc. Roumell won two consecutive Wall Street Journal stock picking contests in 2001 and 2002, and his investing approach has been influenced by another deep value investor, Marty Whitman. Roumell also writes on Seeking Alpha and his articles can be found here . Roumell Asset Management describes its investing philosophy as follows: Roumell Asset Management, LLC ("RAM") pursues long-term capital growth and income through opportunistic value investing. We seek to own a basket of deeply researched, conservatively financed securities that are out of favor, overlooked or misunderstood by Wall Street and thus able to be bought at a significant discount to our calculation of intrinsic value. We believe this strategy maximizes the probability of above-average rates of return over time. Our focus on price is rooted in empirical research which concludes that cheaper than average stocks (low prices relative to earnings, sales, or book value) have historically generated better than average returns over the long run. Roumell typically invests in micro-caps, but he initiated a position in Apple in the fourth quarter of 2012. Please find below a table detailing the number of Apple shares held by Roumell between Q4 2012 and Q4 2015, based on 13-F filings. In his Q4 2012 quarterly report , Roumell explained his rationale for investing in Apple. With Apple's share price down by 25% in the past few months at that point in time, he found Apple's valuations attractive at "10x earnings, or 8x excluding its net cash holdings" versus the fact that Apple boasts "40% returns on equity, has an entrenched franchise, and grows earnings at double-digit rates." Roumell went on to increase his fund's position in the stock significantly in Q1 2013 and Q2 2013, almost tripling his initial position. In an interview with AdviserOne, Roumell revealed that his fund's average cost for Apple in Q4 2012 and Q1 2013 combined was approximately $71.4. Roumell exited his position in Apple at approximately $130 per share in Q1 2015, but re-entered the stock at $103 per share in August 2015 based on a valuation of 8.3 times ex-net cash P/E. Kindly note that this article is not intended to assess Apple's investment merits as an investment candidate, but rather serve as a case study for exploring large-cap value investing opportunities. There are two takeaways from Roumell's purchase of Apple shares. Firstly, he adopted a "net cash" approach, where he backed out the cash from the stock to get to the stub value of Apple's operating business which was trading at a single-digit ex-net cash P/E multiple. However, I did highlight in my article "How Benjamin Graham Will Possibly Invest In A World Without Net-Nets" that net cash stocks should be discounted if the possibility of repatriating the cash to the parent company is low. In Apple's case, a significant amount of cash was held offshore at overseas subsidiaries (partly for tax reasons), but that this was mitigated by the company's announcement in 2013 that it will return cash to shareholders by 2015. It also is noteworthy that Roumell used the average of Apple's net cash and its tax-effected net cash (a 30% discount haircut on Apple's cash position to account for tax effects for the company's overseas cash holdings) in deriving Apple's ex-net cash P/E. Secondly, Roumell took advantage of the share price volatility that exists even (or more so) with a large-cap stock, in this case Apple whose share price fell by 25%-30% from its 52-week high of $100.7 then. Be it Benjamin Graham's "Mr. Market" metaphor or Howard Marks' reference to how the stock market acts like a pendulum consistently swinging between fear and greed, the underlying principle is the same. The Roumell Opportunistic Value Fund's former co-portfolio manager Ted Crawford (together with Jim Roumell then) commented on the purchase of Apple in the AdviserOne interview, which provided insights as to how a value investor can capitalize on his or her behavioral edge (there are limited, if any, analytical and informational edges to exploit with large-cap stocks) to profit from a sentiment change: We bought it when it wasn't loved...The change in sentiment in Apple was sharp, quick and visceral, and visceral reactions are usually overreactions. In the firm's investor presentation , Roumell also added that the magnitude of Apple's share price decline driven by dramatic sentiment change did not match investors' concerns regarding "gross margin contraction that led to a 10% decline in earnings, fear of innovation vacuum with the loss of Founder and CEO Steve Jobs and stalled iPad growth." Drawing insights from the discussion and case study above, I screen for large-cap stocks (defined as those with market capitalizations exceeding $2 billion) using two criteria: 52-week declines/lows and net cash-to-market capitalization. As a special bonus for my subscribers, they will get access to the full list of the large-cap stocks that appeared on the screens mentioned. There were 40 large-cap U.S. and Asian stocks that experienced a share price decline greater than 30% in the past 52-week period and currently trading at no more than 15% above their 52-week lows. The top five names ranked by 52-week declines are as follows: Belle International Holdings Limited ( OTCPK:BELLY ) (1880 HK) I found 38 large-cap U.S. and Asian stocks with net cash-to-market capitalization ratios above 0.3, and the five most attractive names ranked in order of highest net cash-to-market capitalization are as follows: I wrote about FIH Mobile here , which happens to be an Acquirer's Multiple stock, while this Barron's article highlighted Barclays' buy call on the stock premised on its high net cash-to-market capitalization ratio.
