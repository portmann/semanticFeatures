Apple Full-Year 2016 Earnings Per Share Of $8 A Distinct Possibility - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in AAPL over the next 72 hours. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. Top down forecasts show weaker revenues from iPhones and iPads as unit volumes wane. Volatility in China's stock market suggests an economic turn-down likely in that key market. AAPL stock is breaking down below $100 per share and the trend is lower. Forecasting is always a challenge but it's essential to smart investing. Forecasting the world's most valuable company is a full-time occupation for literally dozens of analysts employed by investment firms worldwide. Getting the forecast right determines the success or failure of an investment thesis and ultimately whether risk is rewarded or punished. In the case of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) forecasting is made easier by the very limited portfolio of products Apple currently sells and the importance of the iPhone to its revenues. A 5% error in the number of iPhones shipped in a given year amounts to something like $6 or $7 billion in revenue and as much as $2 billion in net income depending on margins rates. Analysis who can forecast to within 5% accuracy are a rare breed, so the fact is that investors will find little certainty in forecasts. What they can see with greater clarity is the first derivative of forecast sales - the rate of growth or decline as time passes. I believe the volatility in many technology stock prices reflects investor reaction to relatively small changes in rates of growth or decline since those changes may point to inflection points where it's dangerous to be on the wrong side of the street. Certainly I have been on the wrong side of the street with respect to AAPL for a couple of years now. Surprisingly, to me at least, my forecasts of Apple's sales and profits have been reasonably close. What has punished me is the crossfire of two forces - positive changes in the rate of growth and in parallel higher investor expectations leading to a higher earnings multiple as Apple's income performance continued to outpace the street's projections. That same phenomenon - investor reaction to changes in rates of growth - can be painful for shorts on positive shifts and brutal to longs on negative ones. I believe we are entering a period of negative shifts for Apple. It's useful to have a base model of Apple and better still to have a top-down one. I have prepared one using certain assumptions, all of which can be challenged but each of which is important. My assumptions are: A 2016 smartphone market of 1,450,000 units, only marginally greater than 2015 An iPhone market share of 15% globally A slight drop in average selling prices (ASP's) Those assumptions see Apple earning about $8 per share on $230 billion of revenue and shipping about 218 million iPhones for the full year in 2016, a figure remarkably close to that forecast by Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. My projection is set out below: Analysts consensus for the 2016 fiscal year is for earnings of $9.73, almost 25% over my projection. The point of my projection is not precision but sensitivity. That warrants some thought. If iPhone market share rises or falls by one percentage point it will swing revenues by $8 or $9 billion and net income by $1.5 to $2 billion. The market would have to grow by almost 100 million units for market growth to offset such a share loss. Market share is very important. A one percentage point move in market share is not a remote possibility. In fact, iPhone market share has been quite volatile since the product was first introduced and was only 13.5% in third quarter of 2015, having fallen sharply since December 2014. Apple's iPhone picked up a bit of share in the September 2015 quarter but was still in the 15% range. Apple's iPad share is expected to remain below 30% for the next five years. There are plenty of signals that the iPhone is under pressure despite bullish and hopeful articles by stalwarts like Mark Hibben and Bill Maurer . There is a dearth of ebullient articles evangelizing iPhone sales over Christmas, whereas in past years I have observed mountains of hype gushing over iPhone sales. The one article I found this year reported that iPhones made up 49% of activations in the United States and while impressive this figure is less than last year. Volatility in the Chinese stock market points to a real risk of economic slowdown in that key market, and Apple is not immune. China's smartphone market is forecast to stagnate in 2016, stuck at 470 million units. The iPhone has a paltry 11% of the Chinese market which is dominated by Android OS-based smartphones, according to China Internet Watch. The largest portion of that market is expected to be for lower-priced smartphones where Apple is not represented, with the premium segment showing only modest growth. At least one technical analyst thinks AAPL will trend sharply lower, calling for as much as a 29% decline . With Apple so widely held by institutions who hold 58% of AAPL stock, any weakness could turn into a rout. I covered my January 2016 puts today capturing the increased value arising from the over $30 point fall in AAPL from its recent high and will put on a new short on any bounce.
