Verizon-AOL: Whither The Huffington Post? - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha When Verizon paid $4.4 billion for AOL, the Huffington Post was valued at $1 billion. Verizon has no good experience with news sites. It wanted the ad network. In the wake of Verizon's (NYSE: VZ ) purchase of AOL (NYSE: AOL ) for $4.4 billion, analysts are now asking, "whither The Huffington Post?" The site, dubbed HuffPo by its fans and MarxPo by its detractors, is a fiercely liberal news aggregator, founded by Arianna Huffington in 2006, and purchased by AOL for $315 million in 2011. Only $15 million of that $315 million was in stock, but co-founder Arianna Huffington would have taken a profit on the Verizon purchase, which seems to have valued the site at $1 billion. Most of the speculation concerns the site's editorial direction. Verizon is known as an opponent of net neutrality, for instance, and the Post supports it. The phone company approves of the Patriot Act, which HuffPo opposed. It just does not seem like a good fit. It's not as easy as re-naming the site Verizon Post and stamping the phone company's views on it. Under AOL, the Huffington Post group included a number of other sites, like Engadget, TechCrunch, Moviefone, Popeater and Autoblog, covering a wide variety of subjects. All of those are now going to be owned by Verizon. Under AOL Huffington also launched international editions, and tried local editions - AOL also owned the ill-starred Patch sites. In the wake of the Verizon deal Huffington sent out a memo talking about grand new directions, about hiring new bloggers and going into new subject areas. Verizon has not just bought a political site with a liberal reputation, in other words. It has bought a new media empire it has no experience managing. It has tried publishing before, with a tech site called SugarString, but closed that in 2013 after arguments over its editorial direction. The logical move would thus be a sale or spin-off, which could recoup some of Verizon's $4.4 billion price on AOL - it mainly wanted the video ad network anyway. Huffington's co-founder at the Post was venture capitalist Ken Lerer , who later co-founded Buzzfeed. A purchase of the assets by Buzzfeed, and a subsequent IPO under Lerer, would seem to be one attractive alternative. According to The New York Times, Huffington personally reached out to a host of other potential purchasers - German publisher Axel Springer, French publisher Le Monde, Napster founder Sean Parker, and private equity firm General Atlantic among them -- but it is unknown whether there was interest. General Atlantic could easily emerge as a buyer, repackaging the site's assets and sending them on, perhaps in pieces, to other purchasers. The reported $1 billion valuation of The Huffington Post should also be placed in a media industry context. When Jeff Bezos bought The Washington Post he paid $250 million. The publicly-traded New York Times Co. (NYSE: NYT ) has a market cap of $2.3 billion. Huffington may seem like a small fish on Wall Street, in other words, but in the media world it is a fairly sizable one. The fate of the site is certain to draw enormous attention toward Verizon, which the phone company may not want, and the investment is big enough that it must at least want to break even. Until something is decided it will remain a hot potato on its balance sheet. Source: Verizon-AOL: Whither The Huffington Post?
