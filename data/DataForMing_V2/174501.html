ETF Hub Sep 16 2015, 19:03 ET | By: Carl Surran , SA News Editor J.P. Morgan analysts warn that companies with large amounts of floating-rate debt - including Chesapeake Energy, Freeport McMoRan, Ford and GE - could be at risk if the Fed decides to raise interest rates . Companies with variable/floating-rate debt suffer a more immediate impact by a rate hike than companies with fixed-rate debt, the analysts say; variable-rate coupons typically reset quarterly, meaning that changes in the base rate flow through almost immediately to variable-rate borrowers, while fixed-rate borrowers do not see such an impact until they refinance or issue new debt. JPM lists 25 companies - not including financials - that have the “highest variable-rate debt as a percentage of market cap": FMC , NRG , FCX , AES , CVC , LVLT , PVH , CHK , FE , DVA , THC , OI , CNX , F , HCA , FOSL , RCL , JOY , GE , ADS , ALLE , HBI , GT , DNB , AN wat...article is literally about how they have one of the highest variable rate debt loads, how will GE be a safe haven from a rate hike? this changes as he is divesting financial business;  also .25% increase in short term rates is not likely to affect 10 yr rates.  too much talk about fed rate change long overdue Bring it on. The economy has been pondering this for a few years . Let's get it over with and let the chips fall where they may. Agreed:) And really if these companies are "at risk" after this many years of near zero then they get what they get. Having said that, at this point in time it's very unlikely rates will rise much. Do they really feel 250-500 basis points will reek havoc? I've found far better dividend stocks than GE.  For years we watched GE waddle around the mid 20s with a fair but not good dividend.  LMT, GD and HON were better investments. I wonder how much of Ford's automotive debt is variable rate vs. Ford credit?  It doesn't matter much for Credit if the rate is 25 basis points higher - it might even improve their spreads. Much of it is psychological and a strong dollar will hinder competitiveness. Many companies still sit on a lot of cash. Imo , I think the whole market goes up whether they raise or not and a lot of these stocks will follow. Tired of waiting for that shoe to drop. Do it already. These stock prices will probably go down, because the churners will try to beat each other dumping them, but the companies aren't going to close up shop. And GE? Ford? They will be here when we're all dead. The slow rise in rates (and the consequent drop in asset prices) is mostly built in already.  I am not expecting a big change; but if one happens,...I'll sit and watch, waiting for bargains, or trimming gains.  I do not sell into scare tactics. I wish the FED would just do it and raise rates 25 BP's. Every 3 months all I hear and read is will they or won't they raise rates. The FED needs to be clear about how fast rates will rise. One and done for this year and then data dependent for next year.  Very slow and steady should be the FEDs message. We need to normalize interest rates for the economy to grow.
