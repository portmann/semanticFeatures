AgroFresh: Niche Leader With Organic Growth At A Discounted Valuation - AgroFresh Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:AGFS) | Seeking Alpha Recent fresh apple market woes have unfairly punished the stock. Patent protected new lines of business will generate organic earnings growth. I recommend a long position on AgroFresh, with a price target of $10.67, representing 96% upside to current valuation. AGFS' shares reached a peak of $13.21 in July 2015, but a poor global apple crop, concerns about patent expiration and nascent competition has led to investor flight. These concerns are overstated, and this mispricing presents the opportunity for investors to acquire the business below deal price, invest alongside management, and invest at an attractive valuation of 7.5x forward EBITDA with 10.3% free cash flow yield with substantially no continuing capital requirements and a multi-year runway for patent-protected organic growth. AgroFresh is a small agro-chem company primarily focused on products that impact the harvest of fruit crops. Its chief product is SmartFresh, a 1-methylcyclopropene ("1-MCP") binder that prevents fruits/flowers from undergoing ethylene uptake (ripening) - thereby dramatically improving storage life. It is most widely used on apples but has application for other fruits and vegetables as well. SmartFresh is the dominant market leader in this application, with over 85% of apples held for >3 months storage in the US. Among ethylene control products, SmartFresh represents 97% of the market. Penetration of global apple production is ~55%. This leadership is reinforced through patent protections on formulation in its largest markets through 2018 During the AGFS roadshow mid-year 2015, the company provided guidance indicating $177M in revenue and $100M in EBITDA for FY2015. The deal began trading strongly, reaching a high price of $13.21. Subsequently, AGFS announced Q3 results in November and revised its guidance down to $87-93M in EBITDA for 2015. On the 3Q call, management initially refused to provide any full-year guidance. Having brought down estimates so soon after marketing the deal, and then initially refusing to provide updated estimates, the AGFS management team seemed to have shed all credibility and the shareholder fallout was immediate. The resulting panic saw shares decline by ~30%. Management only provided full-year guidance following the rout, in response to this investor exodus. Since then, AGFS has shaken up the board through the appointment of Marc Lasry, the founder/owner of Avenue. That he would personally involve himself in AGFS is, seemingly, an indicator that Avenue Capital is still invested in AGFS' prospects both in regards to principal at stake, but perhaps also as it pertains to marketing future deals for Avenue Capital. The CEO, Thomas MacPhee, was removed effective 3/11/2016, with current AGFS management explaining that they are looking for a more entrepreneurial, growth-oriented leader. In the 1Q16 review, AGFS reiterated guidance for 2016, setting expectations for FY net sales to increase 5% to 12% year-over-year and Adj. EBITDA to range from $90M to $100M ex-FX impact (vs. $91M in FY15). For the year-end meeting, the company announced that it had repurchased $2.5M worth of warrants and 400K shares at an average price of ~$5.80. Repurchases continued in 1Q. This has coincided with significant insider share purchases. From November 2015-present, insiders have purchased nearly $350K in shares in a price range of $5.36-$6.39 1.) SmartFresh sales shortfall belies secular growth trend Globally, total fresh market apple production has grown year over year, largely due to increased production from China, increasing from an estimated 53.0M metric tons ("MT") in the 2010-2011 harvest to an estimated 66.5M MTs in the 2015-2016 harvest, growing nearly 5% annually. The total market is expected to grow to 100M MTs by 2025. Further, there is reason to believe that this year may represent a return to trend. Though El Nino has made for a difficult southern hemisphere harvest (1Q harvest decreased over 13% from 2015), there are early signs that the North American market will rebound. The 2015 Washington crop was impacted by frost and subsequent drought conditions. This year, the weather remained warm during budding and so far the rainfall has been average. Corrugated paper and packaging producers have already signaled a pickup in demand from the Pacific Northwest for agricultural purposes. Historically, sales of SmartFresh have dramatically outpaced global production, growing at a 32% CAGR between 2002 and 2014. Currently, there is additional growth opportunity in EMEA and Asian Pacific markets. Management has targeted $30M in additional sales into those geographies within 5 years. Additionally, SmartFresh is being perfected for use in alternative applications beyond apples and pears which could result in an additional $20M of incremental sales independent of present customer harvests. Harvista is a pre-harvest spray that allows fruit to stay on the tree longer. This provides two central benefits to orchards: Longer tree ripening resulting in bigger, more colorful fruit and by controlling the timing of fruit drop, Harvista allows the farmer to better plan his harvest schedule, allowing for labor arbitrage. There is a competitive product, ReTain, that has been in use for 20 years. However, it seems very much disadvantaged vs. Harvista. In a paper examining the effectiveness of ReTain and napthaleneacetic acid in controlling fruit drop, the results note: "As a comparison, 120 g/acre of Harvista (1-MCP) applied on Sept. 7 provided similar drop control as the best Retain+NAA treatment. However, ReTain alone was less effective in controlling preharvest drop." While the existence of supplementary products necessitates that Harvista be priced competitively, resulting in narrower margins than SmartFresh, the company is still guiding to EBITDA margins in the mid-40% range with fully ramped sales of $50M by 2020. It should be noted that ReTain is not registered for use outside of the US, creating a large market opportunity for Harvista. The Harvista patent is slated to expire in 2021 RipeLock is a banana storage product that functions as an atmospheric control within a portable plastic bag. Essentially, this bag is post-harvest packaging that prevents ethylene uptake. Traditionally, bananas are harvested early, shipped, and landed at riperies for additional ethylene aging and then distribution to retail. This product might eventually allow a direct to retail model to emerge, or in the very least improve the ease of passage for the crop. It appears as though there is still ongoing work around how best to integrate the product and exactly who will bear the cost. RipeLock is slated to make a formal launch in 2H16. Patents on the development products do not expire until 2027. AdvanStor couples with RipeLock to improve banana storage, though commercialization is still at least a year out. 3.) Misconceptions around patent expiration The SmartFresh product is protected by a patent on the formulation of the Î±-cyclodextrin 'donut' which suspends the volatile 1-MCP compound. This sugar complex is patent protected in SmartFresh's major markets until the end of 2018, inviting potential generic competition. I believe that the threat of competition is overstated because at its core, AGFS is a service company. Margin is derived from ongoing technical and customer support, rather than unique formulation. There are many factors which influence success in preserving apples and other fruits. These necessitate continued servicing and technical assistance, underlining AGFS' service package. Such factors include genotype, pre-harvest environmental conditions, physiological age of fruit, treatment conditions, post-harvest storage conditions, and impact of treatment on pathological/physiological disorders. This type of information is needed to define and refine use recommendations in each crop, and this is what AGFS offers to its customer. Adding to this, the company has decades-long relationships with certain customers and offers continuing service through training, technical support, troubleshooting and advisory services. Additionally, AGFS maintains a proprietary database which collects harvest and application data across regions and time. This data is anonymized and can provide insight for farmers for current and future harvest practices. Though most basic application information is widely available through land grant universities, 17 years of proprietary data provide additional value to AGFS' customers. Presently, nearly Â¼ of net sales are derived from countries without patent protection for the encapsulation process. In those countries, AGFS has realized margins in line with patent protected countries. iii.) Low ticket price vs. high ROI justifies current pricing structure Cost is small relative to apple sale price. Treatment is approximately $0.005/apple. In the current market, this represents less than 3% of the selling price of the apple. Switching costs are not explicit, but it would require forming a relationship with a new vendor, adopting new application procedures, and trusting the efficacy of alternatives. For many, it simply would not be worth the effort. Channel checking has shown that customers are very positive on the product and the service offering. "As we move also to more precision ag, having good technical folk in place is important. AgroFresh also do trainings - last week for example I was part of a two day quality management workshop." The recurring theme is that competitive products would have to be materially cheaper to cause them to switch, "I would say that [Agrofresh] provided very good technical support for 1MCP... I would probably not switch to a generic unless it were substantially cheaper" In a global market that is only a couple of hundred million in size, a competitive operation would need to replicate AGFS' selling channels, representatives, harvest database, and ongoing service operation, and would have to do it at a substantially lower price to seize share, further reducing the attractiveness of the market. When the company was purchased from Dow (NYSE: DOW ), the tax amortization contingency ensured that 85% of the tax benefits from the step-up would accrue to Dow. As such, GAAP margins are distorted. AGFS enjoys 80% gross cash margins on their sales - the impact of the step-up is non-cash. Regarding operating costs, R&D has declined from the prior year due to the discontinuation of certain projects. SG&A has grown largely due to one-time expenses and a transition service agreement in place with Dow. The company has targeted a $11.3M quarterly runrate SG&A expense (stock-based comp inclusive) vs. $19.7M realized in 1Q16 due to severance costs associated with CEO and President departure and start-up costs associated with standing-up AGFS corporate governance and back office. AGFS has the cheapest valuation relative to the comp group on a TEV/FCF basis and a discount to the group on a TEV/EBITDA basis. FMC (NYSE: FMC ), Platform Specialty (NYSE: PAH ), and American Vanguard (NYSE: AVD ) are probably the closest competitors in terms of market alignment and end markets. AGFS can be largely assessed as a binary outcome. If the company is able to justify its service package price over the long term, thereby outperforming competitive entrants and generic threats, it will continue to realize outsized margins and generate substantial free cash flow. In an alternative scenario, increased competition leads to dramatic sales declines at SmartFresh, partially offset by growing sales from patent protected products. In the following bull scenario, SmartFresh's revenue ramp continues through 2020, bolstered by increased sales into alternative fruit products and international penetration. Margins remain unchanged, though new offerings are expected to be lower margin. In the bear case, AGFS loses nearly 45% of SmartFresh sales over a 3-year period and margins compress due to competitive pressure. The reality likely falls somewhere in-between. 1.) Organic certification: AGFS formally applied for organic certification in November 2015 and cleared the preliminary hurdles. The National Organic Standards Board ("NOSB") minutes indicate that they are putting together a technical advisory panel to review the petition. Assuming it attains the panel's recommendation, this could happen by mid-2017 2.) Food Safety Modernization Act: The passing of the FSMA was intended to provide the FDA with the tools to prevent food supply contamination. When fully implemented, the act may broadly increase the use of 1-MCP treatments for lower cost commodity produce, such as broccoli, whereas today treatment would not make sense economically. 3.) Acquisitions: The company has repeatedly expressed its intent to develop AGFS' product breadth. Successful acquisitions may cause the market to rerate AGFS' shares as it would no longer appear to be a single product consideration and would be able to leverage their market dominance and extensive client presence especially in the pomme fruit market. AGFS is being unreasonably discounted due to transitory issues pertaining to global apple harvest, and lack of appreciation for the competitive advantages that the company possesses. Comparable securities and probability-adjusted returns imply a significantly understated market valuation. That valuation is underpinned by organic growth, minimal capital requirements, and a defensible niche business reinforced by insider purchases and continued involvement by the sponsor group.
