The Long Case For Disney - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Nov. 11, 2015  2:43 PM ET  |  About: The Walt Disney Company (DIS) , Includes: CMCSA , FOX , HAS , MAT , NWS , TWX by: John D Li Cross-segment product development allows investment in one product to increase revenue throughout various sectors. Disney’s movie franchise building and movie studio box office returns are unmatched in the industry. By John D Li, Dennis Wang, Michael Huang , and Greg Lim Recently Disney (NYSE: DIS ) has been plagued with fears that movement to online entertainment has cut into ESPN profits and subscribers. Although ESPN has been losing subscribers, its profits continue to grow due to higher advertising costs. As the nation's leading sports network, ESPN holds an advantageous position as one of the few remaining sources of entertainment that has not fully transitioned online yet, and its small but steady growth year-to-year shows that any cord-cutting fears can be put to rest; there is no real substitute for ESPN. To understand why Disney is a long buy, we have to stop dwelling over ESPN and focus on the massive growth potential of Disney's other segments, including theme parks and studio entertainment, their next two most profitable segments, which have grown at a far greater rate than their media networks segment (see chart below). Other than media networks, Disney's four other sources of revenue are its theme parks and resorts, studio entertainment, consumer products, and Disney Interactive segments. What makes Disney different is that any development in any one of these four sources of revenue will lead to opportunities in the other three segments. By developing and marketing products across their segments, each segment can boost growth in the other ones, making it a strong bet to go long Disney. Disney's movie studio segment has been one of the fastest growing studios in the movie industry lately, with box office grosses consistently up year-to-year, year-to-date profits up 27% over last year, and 2015 Q4 profits more than doubling 2014 Q4 profits. Disney has more blockbuster franchises than any other competing studio, with the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the live action fairy tale remakes, Pixar Studios, Disney Animation Studios, and now the rebooted Star Wars franchise. Each of these franchises is launching some of their potentially most marketable, most profitable, and most easily merchandised entries within the next couple of years, increasing growth potential for the company significantly. The Good Dinosaur and Star Wars: Episode VII are tracking to dominate the holiday box office season, with the combined revenues from both films projected to total at least $2 billion worldwide (online ticket presales for Star Wars VII have broken the previous records by over 6 times). Next year, The Jungle Book live action remake should top this year's Cinderella ($542 million) given the larger male demographic. Furthermore, the Alice in Wonderland sequel should build off the goodwill of the first movie (which earned over $1 billion in worldwide grosses a few years back). Meanwhile, Captain America: Civil War is being sold as a quasi-Avengers sequel, one of Disney and Marvel's biggest franchises (The Avengers earned $1.5 billion), and Finding Dory is building off the goodwill of one of the most highly acclaimed and highest grossing Pixar film ever, Finding Nemo (which earned nearly $900 million over a decade ago). However, it's far more important to look beyond these simple movie box office grosses. There is potential for these films to build into far larger franchises, with Star Wars already planning four more films including a spinoff and a video game series (Electronic Art's Star Wars: Battlefront game being released next week on multiple platforms has been well received by critics and users and is projected to sell 13 million copies), Pixar releasing sequels for Toy Story (Toy Story 3 earned over $1 billion), Cars, and The Incredibles, and Marvel releasing their final Avengers films. Disney's biggest strength is their ability to develop and market laterally across segments. Even more significant than the pure box office grosses of these films is that these franchises are all insanely easy to merchandise, and the profit off merchandising is substantial (Cars and Cars 2 have collectively earned over $10 billion in merchandising, and Star Wars, Toy Story 4, and Cars 3 certainly won't hurt that). Consumer products is one of their fastest growing segments, with revenues increasing at a faster rate than any other segment (operating income was up 27% year-to-date Q4 2015 vs Q4 2014), and the increasingly merchandised film franchises will only expand that segment even more. Tie that all together with the new theme park attractions that can arise from these movies (the new Star Wars attraction opening in Disneyland is already gaining attention), and it shows that the studio entertainment segment is tantamount to Disney's success in other segments. By increasing the marketing spend on one of these franchises, Disney can potentially increase revenue for their theme park and consumer product segments. Disney's ability to integrate their products through their entire brand is key for their future growth and development. Disney's theme parks are possibly the most iconic aspects of the company. Not only are they Disney's second largest segment and make up over 20% of their operating income, but they are also pivotal to Disney's branding and marketing. With the reintroduction of the Star Wars universe, as previously mentioned, new attractions built around Star Wars will be increasingly popular and drive up demand for Disney theme parks. Similarly, any of Disney's film franchises are able to draw in new visitors. Conversely, the theme parks build a strong brand identity for Disney. By increasing attractions and advertisements within and around the parks, Disney is able to market their films and merchandise more effectively to visitors. With this in mind, growth potential in the theme parks is huge with the $5.5 billion Shanghai Disneyland park opening Spring 2016. Shanghai is the third most populated city in the world, and Chinese culture is currently in a state of Westernization. Disney has distributed three of China's highest grossing films (Avengers 2, Iron Man 3, and Captain America 2 are all among the top 25 highest grossing films of all time in China), with the upcoming Star Wars sequel projected to be another hit in a string of Disney successes. Disney's franchises and properties are becoming increasingly popular in China, which provides positive feedback once the Shanghai theme park opens: Disney movies drive Chinese visitors to the park, and the park drives visitors into theaters. Shanghai's theme park will be a significant catalyst towards Disney's future growth, so the theme park needs to live up to the hype. There were are estimated 400 million prevented births since 1978 because of China's one child policy, but since the recent lift of this policy, a small boom of births is to be expected . Within 5-10 years, an extremely large amount of young Chinese children will be consuming Disney media. As mentioned earlier, the up and coming young Chinese population will consume more than just media: they will increase demand for Disney merchandise, increase the number of visitors at the Shanghai Disney Resort, and increase video game sales from Disney Interactive. As we previously mentioned, Disney's consumer products division is heavily linked with the film franchise and theme park growth. Once the future franchises and theme park plans are set in place, merchandising will naturally follow. Star Wars, Pixar, and Disney Animation Studios will especially increase consumer product sales. Moreover, contrasting Disney with its consumer products competitors Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ: HAS ), Mattel, Inc. (NASDAQ: MAT ), and News Corporation (NASDAQ: NWS ), Disney is second to only Mattel, INC. In particular, Mattel, INC has been underperforming since mid 2013. Furthermore, Mattel lack's Disney's interconnected presence. On the other hand, Hasbro, Inc. has been performing well since 2007 with the launch of the Transformers film franchise. This trend further supports the success of Disney's formula of cross sector development. However, it's important to keep in mind that Disney's film franchises dwarf Hasbro, Inc.'s film sector. Because of this, Disney shines among its competitors. In conclusion, going long on Disney is a good bet. Disney's P/E ratio of 23.68 is slightly above the 15.00 for the industry, but the industry includes companies like Time Warner (NYSE: TWX ), Fox (NASDAQ: FOX ), and Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ), which have much lower potential for growth compared to Disney and much lower worldwide brand recognition. Disney has a solid dividend yield of 1.2%, its cash flow is solid, and Q4 reports have shown that almost all of its strongest segments have received double-digit growth. With the holiday season approaching, Disney is looking good to continue this growth through Q4 2015. As most investors focus on the reduced ESPN subscriber numbers, it is easy to forget that its other segments are poised to continue double-digit growth for the next quarter, and will continue to grow at an impressive rate for several quarters after that. Although Star Wars: The Force Awakens may have already been priced into the stock, we have shown that Star Wars as a franchise and property is so much more than just another movie. Sure, Star Wars may not live up to the hype, and sure ESPN may be overrun by online providers, but that does not necessarily matter in the long run. Due to the interconnected segments, all Disney needs is one of its franchises to succeed and the rest will follow. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
