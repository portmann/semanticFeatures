Intel, Verizon, Dell And The Connected Cow - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Verizon has announced Hum and ThingSpace to lower the cost of connecting things to the Internet. Dell has the connected cow to make IoT relatable. Intel provides more than just the chips to make all of this possible and will reveal their latest IoT Insights on November 3. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) has been working on developing IP and products for the IoT (Internet of Things) for many years with the idea that they do not want to miss this next huge growth area which companies like DHL and Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ) have estimated to be 50 billion things by 2020 . These companies estimate that IoT will deliver a $1.9 trillion boost to supply chain and logistics operations. While Intel will sell chips to go into Things, their biggest financial benefit will come from sales of processors for gateway devices to collect data at the edge and data centers needed to store/process/analyze the data from 50 billion Things so that personal computing devices can connect humans to the useful Big Data analytics. (Note that the chips in Things, onsite gateways and onsite processor chips are part of the Intel IoTG while the processors in data centers are part of the Intel DCG.) One of the factors holding IoT back has been the cost of connecting limited use devices to the Internet. Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) has recognized this and recently announced programs to connect cars at a lower cost ( Hum ) and to provide a variety of data connection plans for various types of devices and usage ( ThingSpace ). ThingSpace will encourage more IoT devices by providing flexible data plans for Things that are connected to the Internet. This will likely lead to other Internet service providers offering similar packages and ultimately grow the IoT business. While many connected products rely on Wi-Fi or Bluetooth and then use the customer's mobile phone for any mobile connectivity, there are entire classes of devices such as dog trackers, luggage trackers and automotive applications that would benefit from an always-on cellular connection. But the added cost of a cellular subscription can make the final price of the device untenable for the consumer, or even corporate market. Which is why Verizon's plan to offer flexibility on new data plans for "Things" is important. This is one area where smaller developers and larger corporate customers have been begging telecommunications companies for flexibility for years. Now that Verizon has opened the door, other data service providers such as AT&T (NYSE: T ), Sprint (NYSE: S ) and T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS ) will likely follow providing a huge boost to the IoT Industry. Dell has worked closely with Intel at all levels from Things to gateways at the edge to data centers and to PCs that provide a working, useful and secure platform for IoT. To make IoT more personal Dell has talked about their connected cow program. Kirsten Billhardt, Marketing Strategist for the Internet of Things at Dell, says that Changing the conversation to something as friendly and accessible as cows has changed everything. Now there are smiles and a real interest to hear more. I can sketch out the story pretty quickly. I share how there is a dairy farm, Chitale Dairy in India, that was having a problem with low milk yields. So they tagged the animals - with radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags (I leave out this part) - that, when scanned, transmits unique information on each cow back to the data center. Farmers can use their mobile phones to pull up information on each animal, and use this to better treat each individual cow. Chitale Dairy now has a complete end-to-end "cows to cloud" strategy in place. Vishvas Chitale, Director, Chitale Dairy, says, "We've transformed our dairy operations using technology, and the feeding and breeding of animals is now monitored by computers. By automating the collection of data from each farm, we have improved animal health, leading to increased milk yield per animal. We've also streamlined the efficiency of our distribution channels for faster delivery of our milk products to consumers." On November 3 Intel will hold its third annual IoT Insights. In the past this IoT Insights day has been filled with valuable data regarding what Intel is doing in the IoT space. Most of it has focused on examples (like saving hundreds of thousands of dollars a year by connecting sensors in a building and doing things like adjusting HVAC based on the number of people in various parts of the building) and programs in the R&D space (like harvesting power from the area around the Things to power the electronic device collecting and transmitting data). In the past Brian Krzanich, Intel CEO, has been absent from these IoT Insights presentations. On November 3 Intel appears to be pulling out all the stops with Brian leading the presentations and all of the Intel big hitters including Diane Bryant (VP Data Center Group), Doug Davis (VP, Internet of Things Group), Doug Fisher (VP Software and Services Group), Josh Walden (VP New Technology Group) and Chris Young (VP Intel Security Group) will be presenting. I will be watching to see how Intel in the IoT space is shaping a wide breadth of industries. I expect to hear about many real-world deployments across the globe. I also expect to hear announcements about new IoT technology from Intel that will be introduced in the near term. Finally I expect to hear about research Intel is doing to make IoT more convenient and useful in the future. The most important aspect to investors may be the Intel technology announcements that may be made. Intel keeps these announcements close to the vest prior to making them but I expect to hear about technology and programs that will increase the attractiveness, ease-of-use, usefulness, practicality and security of connected Things. For background let's review Intel's IoT Group revenues and profits. The revenue and operating income for the IOTG operating segment for the third quarter of 2015 compared to the third quarter of 2014 were as shown in the top chart below: Net revenue for the IOTG operating segment increased by $51 million, or 10%, in Q3 2015 compared to Q3 2014. Net revenue grew 12% from 2012 to 2013 and 19% from 2013 to 2014. 15% seems like a reasonable expectation going forward. If we use an annual growth rate of 15%, the 2014 revenues will grow to $2.8 billion in 2016. While this will not dramatically move Intel's overall earnings, every contributing profit helps. Keep in mind that Intel's IoTG includes platforms designed for embedded market segments, such as retail, transportation, industrial, buildings and home. As such it includes chips for Things - chips for gateways at the edge to connect Things to data centers. However, it does not include the data center that benefits from growth in the IoT. Data generated by Things will go through, be stored in and analyzed by data centers with Intel processors, SSDs, communications devices and soon 3D Xpoint DIMMs. The biggest benefit I see associated with IoT for Intel in the near term is an increase in the shine associated with Intel stock. With the market understanding that Intel is making good progress at the leading edge of the huge IoT industry (along with other emerging growth areas), the market will run up the price to earnings ratio from the current 14.5 to the 18 that Intel had late last year. A PE ratio of 18 would move Intel from the current $34 to $42. Please see my article on emerging growth trends for discussion of other Intel growth areas that will contribute to Intel's shine and PE increase to 18.
