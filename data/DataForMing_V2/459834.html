Are Amazon Shares Stalling? - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Amazon shares have underperformed the averages during the past several days as the markets were making new highs. Amazon's delivery efficiency perhaps is not as efficient as we have been programmed to think it is. Since February 9, 2016, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) shares are up 53.75% from $482.07 per share to $741.20 as of July 14, 2016. Despite such impressive performance, Amazon shares are actually up only about 9.67% year-to-date from 675.89 on December 31, 2015, as Amazon suffered a setback in the first five weeks of the year, dropping by as much as 40.2%.

Despite Amazon's underperformance of about 3.3% vs. the Dow Jones average for the past several days, Amazon is still outperforming the index year-to-date, as the Dow Jones is only up about 6.25% vs. Amazon being up 9.67% as of July 14. Amazon stock vs. DJIA July 11 to July 14 - Source: Yahoo Finance It is possible that Amazon's stock is simply consolidating given its most recent gains since February. On the other hand, as per the article we published on July 1, 2016, "Will Amazon buckle under the weight of its price to book ratio?" - we do believe that Amazon's stock price is simply unjustified at current levels and is poised for a major drop. As we had already stated: Given Amazon's elevated valuation both from the perspective of price to book ratio, as well as price to earnings ratio, in addition to macro economic headwinds related to Brexit, U.S. elections, a stronger dollar, in addition to the negative effect on consumers' disposable income by the recent increase in gas prices, we believe Amazon shares can drop noticeably from current levels during the next several months. Hence, given Amazon's inability to trade higher as the indices were making new all-time highs during the past several days, in addition to its most recent divergence, whereby it has actually traded lower, Amazon could be showing early signs of suffering under the weight of its P/B and P/E ratios. In our prior article we had discussed various quantitative measures supporting our thesis of why we felt Amazon shares could be poised for a major pullback. As many of our readers commented, Amazon had often defied the odds in the past as it traded higher as many feel that such indicators do not apply to Amazon. There's a blind faith in Amazon that no matter what Amazon does, or what business it enters, it will ultimately dominate such business due to its ability to simply innovate and provide unmatched pricing and service. Although Amazon is often praised for its efficiency in delivery and pricing, we believe such two metrics are somewhat overblown. I do not typically like to do so, but I will provide a personal example. Fifty years ago, my grandmother, who lived in a third world country, would wake up at about 07:00 AM every morning, and upon determining her needs for fresh groceries and other needs for the day, she would call her grocer at the corner of her street. On such call, she would tell him what groceries she wanted, including other needs such as stationery, cooking gas cylinder, meat, etc... In less than one hour, the delivery boy from the grocery store would show up at her doorstep with all her needs. He also will install the cooking gas cylinder for her, and in case she needed to pay any bills, such as phone bills, electric bills, etc..., he would even handle all her bill payment requirements. Similarly, in case she wanted to buy a book or a magazine, she would call her local bookstore, and they would also gladly deliver to her doorstep within a few hours at most, and often within less than one hour. Every neighborhood had its local grocery store, stationer, book store, butcher, baker, hardware store, etc., with almost instantaneous delivery, and let me repeat, that was 50 years ago in a third world country. Such a distribution network enabled immediate delivery of needed goods and services. Today, in the advent of Amazon's praised model, we have moved to a central fulfillment and warehousing model. Next, everyone seems to be amazed at how Amazon is capable to deliver products within two days, while Amazon is currently testing drone technology in order to shorten delivery time to within hours (a service my grandmother enjoyed 50 years ago). Meanwhile, many neighborhood stores seem to be simply out of business due to their inability to compete on price with Amazon, while Amazon itself, which has been in business for 22 years, has yet to show consistent profitability (as illustrated by the excessive price to book ratio of its shares). Ironically, Amazon has come full circle, as now it has announced that it aims to open actual physical retail stores, after it had driven many retailers out of business. Amazon shares are an exuberant phenomenon. As in any exuberance, as long as people indulge in such exuberance, it can be maintained and become even more exuberant. It is possible that the recent underperformance in Amazon's shares during the past few days are a very early indication that such exuberance is reaching its end. Meanwhile, Amazon's launching of physical retail stores also is an indication that Amazon cannot simply rely on its e-commerce strategy. However, in order to raise its profitability significantly, Amazon's pricing edge will likely erode, hence once again, making itself prone to competitive factors. As a result, we continue to favor shorting Amazon shares at current levels.
