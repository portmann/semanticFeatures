Could Apple Eliminate The iPad Mini? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha The future of Apple's smaller tablet is uncertain. Phone margins are significantly higher. Within the next couple of months, technology giant Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) will unveil its newest set of iPhones and iPads. These products lines have gone in opposite directions during the first nine months of the company's fiscal 2015 period. The popularity of the larger screen iPhone 6 has contributed to a 57% rise in iPhone revenues over the prior year period, according to the most recent 10-Q filing , while iPad revenues are down 24% over that time. This year, consumers and investors are expecting Apple to launch a larger screen iPad, which many believe will help turn around sales of the struggling tablet line. Also, there are rumors out there about the company testing six-inch screens for iPhones, which could come out in 2016. With larger screens seeming to be in play for iPhone and iPad, I will today discuss the possibility of Apple eliminating its smallest tablet, the iPad mini. When Apple originally launched the iPad mini back in 2012, you could still buy an iPhone with a 3.5 inch display. Apple has since increased the screen size of its smartphone, as seen below, with the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus having 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch displays, respectively. As I mentioned above, the company is reportedly testing six-inch displays. I think it's likely in the next year or two that Apple does go to a display of six inches or more for the iPhone. That will have substantially narrowed the screen size disparity between the iPhone and the iPad mini since the tablet has a 7.9-inch display. Many have speculated that the popularity of the larger screen iPhone 6 is a main reason for the fall in iPad sales. An even larger screen for the smartphone would seem to speed up that iPad mini sales decline. There are reports out there that Apple will eliminate the four-inch iPhone next month, something I believe is a mistake . This would push all users to the larger screen phones, which Apple has done in the past with newer versions. If Apple can eliminate a smaller iPhone, why can't it eliminate the smallest iPad? By eliminating the iPad mini, Apple can boost average selling prices for the iPad line and most likely increase overall margins. With a six-inch smartphone out, Apple could theoretically push mini users to a large iPhone, as phone margins are reportedly much higher . In recent quarters, Apple's average iPhone selling price has been about twice the price of the entry level iPad mini, so why not push users from the tablet to a phone? A major concern for investors would be the sales drop-off of millions of iPad mini units. With fiscal 2016 revenues only expected to increase by about 5%, this would likely kill all of Apple's revenue growth in the period. For this reason, I don't think the company will eliminate the iPad mini this year. This is where the larger screen tablet comes in. Apple can hopefully eliminate more iPad mini users with a larger tablet. Like most product launches, I would expect some supply constraints at first, which is why I think a larger screen iPad won't be produced/sold at full blast until sometime next year. In the fall of 2016, Apple could then launch the second version of the larger screen iPad, plus the new iPhone with a display of around six inches. By this time, hopefully iPad mini sales will have fallen off to a level where the overall business won't be impacted. Plus, if the company is selling a large screen iPad or an iPhone at twice the price of an iPad mini, the revenue decline is significantly mitigated. With the success of the iPhone 6 and a larger screen iPad coming to market soon, I think it's certainly time to start thinking about the elimination of the iPad mini. Last year's mini refresh was poor , and I think this year's model could end up being the last one we ever see. With larger screen tablets and phones going for higher selling prices and reportedly generating much higher margins, it makes sense for Apple to eliminate the mini. A move to a six-inch or larger iPhone screen could be the final nail in the coffin, and I don't think the company's revenue picture would necessarily be hurt.
