Ford Hits A Milestone - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford pulled themselves out of the 2008 recession and innovated their way back to success. A testament to their forward thinking is today's PR acknowledging 1 million Eco-boost F-150's sold. We revisit our bull case and reiterate why, even though down 40% from our original F purchases, we remain long. It was just two days ago that we came out and suggested buying the dip in Ford (NYSE: F ) shares. We suggested that those with a long-term investment horizon on the company, like us, could benefit from locking in a yield that was pressing 5% and take advantage of getting a spot to own a company for the long term that we know will be around for many years to come. In the following one and a half trading days Ford, like the rest of the market, has recovered, Equities are up for the second day in a row, which would give buyers two days ago a leg up already on their investment. The FTSE overseas has almost recovered all of its post-Brexit losses, and US markets look ready to follow suit and potentially gain back nearly all of their losses. We have been advocating for a long-term position in Ford for the last year now. We stated from the very beginning that we have a multiple year outlook on the company and that our plan was to reinvest dividends going forward for many years to come. That is a plan we have stuck to and will continue to stick to, as we added shares recently and will continue to add if the stock moves lower. Ford is celebrating the success of its F-150 with its Eco-boost engine this morning, as it announced 1 million of these models have been sold. The press release stated, Ford, America's truck leader, has set a new benchmark in truck capability and efficiency: More than 1 million F-150 pickups with segment-exclusive EcoBoostÂ® engines have now been sold in the United States. "We are proving that with advanced technologies like EcoBoost and high-strength, military-grade, aluminum-alloy construction, Ford continues to outperform the competition by virtually every metric," says Doug Scott, Ford truck group marketing manager. "EcoBoost is delivering the value, capability and performance F-150 customers insist upon, while helping improve their No. 1 demand - better fuel economy." We thought this would be a great opportunity to revisit the last year of our advocating for a long position in Ford, and why the company has been so immensely successful and profitable since the recession of 2007 and 2008. So much of what drew us to Ford was the reinvention of the company after 2008. When General Motors had to recapitalize itself, US automakers were in the doldrums like they had never been in before. They were regarded as failures and the products were regarded as inferior to competition from overseas. The entire attitude on the United States auto market changed in 2007 and 2008. General Motors (NYSE: GM ) is doing well after the recapitalization, but Ford is a company that made it through these doldrums without needing assistance or restructuring, and they have continued to flourish from this point forward. Although some would argue that we hopped on the Ford train late, seeing as how we started buying around $17 and $18 per share, we would argue that we are buying for the next large cyclical move to the upside which may be in a year or may be in several years. What we do believe is important is that we believe Ford is capable of making the leap, and they're capable of doing it through increased execution and profitability overseas. Domestic support was never really an issue for Ford. It's nice that the company was able to move out of the 2008 recession in tact, but it is even more appealing to us that the company has made a plan to expand internationally and is following through with it. The key domestically was that the company was not afraid to innovate and make a big leap incorporating aluminum (and engineering the Eco-boost engine) into its production of the F-150. This was the first major innovative step that the company took after the recession, and it was one that now we know has paid fantastic dividends, literally, for the company. It is this type of investment and innovation that Ford is undertaking both domestically and internationally that we think puts them at the forefront of the two American automakers. General Motors and Dodge stated after the fact that they were also considering incorporating aluminum into their vehicles, but only after the Ford litmus test had taken place. Ford gets to own the rights of being the first to incorporate aluminum into their trucks for fuel efficiency and today they get recognition for reading those reports. We still continue to think that Ford is a great place to allocate some capital, given the company's strong operating history and recent success over the last few quarters. We have talked about incorporating a short position in CACC to potentially offset the effects of an auto financing bubble burst, but more importantly we have talked about and employed our strategy of simply adding slightly more allocation to Ford each time it moves lower. We made the case why Brexit wouldn't effect the company, and now, the valuation simply says it all for us. We stated earlier this week, Not only does Ford generate a majority of its profits from North America, but the international locations that the company is looking to expand to and do business in don't really have too much to do with the United Kingdom exiting the European Union. While Ford is looking to increase its footprint in Europe, the largest investments it has made over the last two years have been in Mexico and China. It has invested in both of these geographies in order to build infrastructure and create product for distribution all over North America and Asia at a cost efficient rate. The United Kingdom's exit from the European Union will have very little effect on Ford's two biggest investments. Trading at 5.8x next year's estimates with a price/sale ratio of 0.32x, Ford remains dirt cheap at these levels. It has been a year or perhaps a year and a few months now, and our Ford predictions for $20 per share have hardly come to fruition. However, this is one case where we continue to have confidence in our investment due to Ford's underlying operating performance holding up and we see more of a reason to add shares here than we do to take some off the table. We are long Ford and will continue to add on dips as long as operating performance continues to impress. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
