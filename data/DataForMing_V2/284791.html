(AAPL) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor 9to5 Mac , which has been fairly reliable with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) product scoops, reports Apple plans to launch a pair of fully wireless Bluetooth Beats headphones (no cable connecting the right and left earbuds), potentially at the same time the iPhone 7 launches. The product stands to be the first major new headphone launch from Beats since Apple bought the company in 2014. 9to5 adds the headphones are expected to come with a portable charging case, and feature a noise-cancelling microphone system that enables calls and Siri commands without an in-line mic or remote. It also joins other sites in reporting the iPhone 7 won't feature a standard 3.5mm headphone jack - headphone users will have to rely either on Bluetooth or a Lightning connector, perhaps with a 3.5mm adapter attached. A petition asking Apple to keep the 3.5mm jack has amassed over 200K signatures . Regarding the iPhone 7, sources tell 9to5 Apple is still testing three different designs, including "a completely new, thinner look as well as a backup design that looks substantially like the iPhone 6S." iPhone/iPad audio codec chip supplier Cirrus Logic (NASDAQ: CRUS ) might also be a supplier for the wireless headphones. Earlier today , Pac Crest (upgraded Cirrus) reported hearing from headphone makers the use of a digital connector such as Lightning both improves sound quality and allows them to embed a smart codec chip within their headphones. @mscottbone, actually your BT comment makes no sense.  BT (or any wireless) is a convenience feature.  The tradeoff for that convenience is reduced sound quality (and reliability).  Just because Apple is introducing BT headphones doesn't mean that improved sound quality isn't one of the benefits of going with lightning connectors (even if, and I agree with you here, it's likely driven more by design/feature factors than SQ).  Two different options aimed at two different types of folks.  If they were rumoured to do away with any physical headphone port, then I'd say you'd have a far more valid point. This does seem to beg the question, one lightning port or two?  Will iP7 be the bridge to wireless charging, doing away with the need to use the lightning port for charging and allowing them to stick with one port? They need to improve the technology a lot to rely on Bluetooth headphones.. particularly if you have several iDevices - I have to rely on Bluetooth connection for my hearing aids and I cannot use the same headphone for all iDevices as it gets very confused.. particularly if a phone call comes through during the listening. I think they should stick with a socket and let people choose how they use bluetooth connected headphones/speakers Further it depends where one is coming from. My iPhone 6S obviously has a 3.5mm jack, upon going to Bose wireless headphones the quality greatly reduced because of my starting point. Albeit, someone else may have really cheap wireless headphones and regardless of what jack or no jack on their phone going to Bose will still give them a sound quality and reliability bump. @aussie, one can still be paired with multiple devices with a bluetooth headset wirelessly, and some protocol determines who interrupts who. For instance with my Bose headphones if a call comes in the video I'm watching on my laptop is muted and video put on pause, while I have the full feature set with the call. As soon as the call ends, the video play/sound is restored. What if I don't want wireless headphones...  Apple is going to  themselves out of the market .  The only ones buying will be those that would buy a doggy do if it looked and apple with a bite out it.  One reason I won't consider apple now./  You have to have an Apple charger an apple this an apple that and they are all expensive. Expensive Apple products seem to work for millions of users, so maybe it is fair to criticize prices, but it doesn't seem to hurt the company.A perceived premium branding success. Bear, people who want the phone will 'adjust.'  Like with all Apple products we don't know what we 'need' till it exists.  People didn't want an iMac without a DVD drive at first, either.  You still can get it but it is hardly necessary. this is what sucks about apple products.  lets make it as difficult as possible to use our product.  nothing intuitive.  As if counter intuitive is cool. I really want to hear from loyal iPhone owners. Does it make sense that Apple may get rid of the 3.5mm jack and force you to go wireless or buy, yet again, another accessory(s)?  Be honest. If you think getting a slimmer phone trumps having to buy new accessories, then fine, say so but please think as a consumer and not as a fan. Thanks. What kind of sorcery is this? This only re-affirms the call to sell Apple. They're once again choosing looks and thin for unpractical and proprietary. The loyal shareholders here should be pleased. earphones break and when they do, users will have to buy only apple headphones. Ok, my opinion is that mini jack analogue connectors are an obvious compromise in sound quality - we're not talking balanced XLRs here - but a useful one in non-Bluetooth and undocked situations. If a $49 Lightning-to-mini jack adaptor does the trick, I have no problem with that, for legacy headphones. I guess my next question is whether the MacBook's USB-C connector will eventually defer to the same protocols via Lightning, to add uniformity across devices... I am an old technologically clueless person,and have found their products easier to use than most of their competitors products, so maybe it is an issue from person to person. Maybe each mind works differently...dunno though. That being said,Apple built their brand on intuitive solutions, so maybe the complexity of the products today require us old dogs to upgrade too...if it were so easy. Maybe they will include in the box a small lightning to 3.5mm adaptor so that those that prefer wired or a specific brand of headphones remain happy? Probably wouldn't need to be much larger than the connecting part of a 3.5mm headphones set. On the other hand people really don't like change...
