Stretch Or Shrink? Here Is What Is New On The Boeing 737 MAX 7 - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Revamped Boeing 737 MAX 7 increases competetivity on 2 markets. Boeing leveraging components of the successful Boeing 737 MAX 8 to the fullest. During the Farnborough International Airshow, Boeing (NYSE: BA ) announced it will be stretching the Boeing 737 MAX design to accommodate up to 12 more seats. Some news regarding the Boeing 737 MAX family was expected on the airshow. Analysts were expecting either an announcement of a stretch that would compete with the Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSF ) A321 or revision of the MAX 7. Boeing chose to make changes to the Boeing 737 MAX 7. In this article I will have a look at the changes on the new MAX 7. The fuselage of the Boeing 737-7 MAX 7 will be stretched by 6.3ft. This stretch will be achieved by adding 2 plugs to the fuselage. A 3.8ft plug will be placed in front of the wing and a 2.5ft plug will be placed aft of the wing. The stretch will add some 5%-6% fuselage length to the Boeing 737 MAX 7 compared to today's Boeing 737-700. The stretch allows operators to carry an additional 12 passengers (2 rows of seats) in 2-class configuration. This puts the Boeing 737 MAX 7 at 138 passengers in 2-class configuration and over 170 passengers in dense configuration. So the MAX will have a significantly higher revenue potential. In 2-class configuration the aircraft's revenue potential is increased by almost 10%. In typical 1-class configuration the aircraft should be able to seat around 155 passengers. To carry the extra weight, the Boeing 737 MAX 7 will be using a thicker wing. In fact, it will be the same wing design as used on the Boeing 737 MAX 8. The thicker wing will be able to carry more fuel to compensate for the additional weight of the extra passengers and luggage, fuselage plugs and the strengthened gear. Additionally, the thicker wing will boost the range of the MAX 7 by 500 nm. The use of a heavier wing and stretched fuselage will lead to a higher operating empty weight. On top of that comes the weight of the additional fuel, passengers and luggage. The total addition in weight requires increases the MAX 7 MTOW (Maximum Take Off Weight) from 70,300 kg to 80,300 kg. This also requires Boeing to use the strengthened landing gear that is used on the Boeing 737 MAX 8. Looking at the changes that are being made to the MAX 7 design, it is clear that the revamped MAX 7 is a shrink of the MAX 8. The changes are being made on customer demand, according to Boeing. So far the Boeing 737 MAX 7 has accumulated 60 orders: 30 from Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV ), 25 from Westjet ( OTC:WJAFF ) and 5 from Canadian Jetlines. I believe that with the changes Boeing is also moving away from the competitive field with Bombardier ( OTCQX:BDRAF ) and already is trying to position itself better for upcoming competition. Additionally, the -7 is an excellent business jet but it is lacking range compared to some other players on the business jet market. By adopting the thicker wing of the MAX 8, Boeing is adding a lot of range to the Boeing 737 MAX 7 BBJ (Boeing Business Jet). The changes to the MAX 7 design will not turn the aircraft into Boeing's new best-seller, but with adoption of the main MAX 8 elements the MAX 7 has a better competitive positioning on two markets.
