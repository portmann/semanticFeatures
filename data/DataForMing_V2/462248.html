Know What A Long Squeeze Is? You Might See One In Netflix - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha There is a more important point from the report than poor guidance or minimal subscriber growth. Churn may point to a new trend in television - one that is positive outside of that context, no less. The after-hours action indicates that pretty much everyone knows the results Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) reported last night, so I'm going to jump straight to what I think is important. Yes, the subscriber additions were a big disappointment. Netflix attempted to underpromise so it could overdeliver, but wound up missing even the lowered expectations big time. Forward guidance for both subscribers and revenue also missed expectations. I think the information on churn was even more important, though. In its letter to shareholders, management said that churn increased "coincident with the press coverage ​in early April of our plan to un­grandfather..." and attributed this to a misunderstanding of the action as price increase rather than the completion of a two-year price break. I can see how customers might confuse the two, as they seem to have the same result. When I look at management's point that churn was minimal amongst customers who were actually experiencing a price increase together with a concession in the Q&A from the conference call that churn is expected to continue, I wind up with a different interpretation. It seems to me that customers did indeed respond to the media attention given to the pending price increases, but it wasn't the extra two dollars that really bothered them. Rather, the event was a reminder that Netflix service wasn't even worth what they were currently paying. I've heard this anecdotally from many people who were, and in some cases still are, Netflix customers. Of course, some people I know swear by Netflix, but just as many are weaning themselves away from TV in favor of other (often more productive AND entertaining) activities. That said, almost everyone concedes that they like to sit down and watch something now and then. When they do retire for a bit of video, some use other commitment-based services, but many are quite satisfied with some combination of free and one-time fee options, such as public broadcasts, RedBox, their local library, and joining or borrowing from friends. I don't know anybody who thought of Netflix's new or prior cost as a burden. The available Netflix content just didn't hold any particular value or interest for them. This anecdotal observation is also supported by statistical information. House of Cards and Orange is the New Black are supposed to be proof of Netflix's ability to produce superior original content. Yet, surprisingly, both shows fail to rank highly amongst Netflix's own viewers when compared against re-runs from other networks. That's particularly troubling when we also see that Netflix increased spending in every category, in most cases by more than revenue increased. Yet, the company came up with worse results than last quarter, which was also a disappointment . These sorts of long-term trends are what investors should be paying attention to. After all, if the growth story is intact, then any pullback is potentially a buying opportunity, right? That reasoning is actually a potential fallacy, because it fails to quantify and price in time . Even before this report, Netflix wasn't expected to have positive cash flow until 2018, and its content liabilities are already 19x that projected figure of $1.49 per share. That multiple could rise if analyst downgrades are the next shoe to drop, but those often have ephemeral effects, and thus, are worth ignoring. What deserves more attention, even though it does not impact the long-term business case, is the current market dynamics. An analysis of the open options positions going into last night's report shows that, at prices that were both liquid and steady after the report, well over half a billion dollars worth of NFLX shares are set to be forced upon buyers for a losses in the next month. Some may not be able to afford the shares, which would force them to sell, thereby creating a cascade that is similar to a short squeeze . Long squeezes are even rarer than short squeezes, and there is no guarantee that one will happen this time. However, the last time I did analysis like this , the effect was pronounced and sustained, despite less compelling figures. My Momentum Mechanism article used Netflix to show an example of how momentum can reverse in a sharp, but sustained way. The 2011 drop documented there lasted for over a year and was also the result of a policy change. However, that change was much more minor and quickly retracted. I don't see any way that Netflix can back away from its price increases at this point. If the company is ever to become sustainably profitable, I think it will have improve both its operations and content. Customizing the latter will be especially difficult in the non-saturated international markets that investors are counting. Otherwise, after a short stint, viewers may simply walk away. NFLX investors have that option too, and exercising it may be their best option until Netflix can fix what seem to be some pretty intractable problems.
