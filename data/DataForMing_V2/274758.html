Ford Motor: 2016 Dividend Hike, Yes Or No? - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha An investment in Ford Motor currently yields 4.19%. I discuss if Ford Motor will increase its dividend payout in early January. If you follow me on Seeking Alpha you probably know that one of my favorite stock investments of 2015 was Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F ). The company and the stock had a lot to offer at the beginning of 2015, at least that's what I thought back then. Fast forward one year and the stock has not done anything for shareholders: Ford is down ~7.7% during a time of heightened volatility and growing economic headwinds. So was my call to buy Ford Motor in 2015 wrong? How you answer this question relates to how long your investment horizon is. If you invest with a 1-year time horizon, Ford Motor was clearly not a good choice. But for anyone who thinks with the long term in mind, just like Warren Buffett teaches investors, Ford Motor might be much more interesting than many investors think. I have recently reduced my price target on Ford's stock from $18 to $17, but an investment in Ford Motor has compelling total return potential nonetheless. And here is why: Ford is widely underappreciated as an income investment. That's right. Ford is an income investment. Though the potential for capital appreciation should clearly play a role when deciding to buy a stock, dividends have great long term value for investors, especially if the company's dividends are rising slowly, but steadily. Right now, an investment in Ford Motor yields 4.19% based on a recurring quarterly dividend payout of $0.15/share. A 4%+ yield from a S&P 500 is a good start for building an income portfolio. But what has 2016 in store for Ford stock investors? Are we going to see a dividend hike in 2016? The central question when it comes to a Ford Motor investment is: Will Ford increase its dividend payout in 2016? The auto maker has traditionally increased its dividend in January. Ford Motor's short term dividend growth trend suggests that the company will also hike its payout in 2016. In early 2014, Ford Motor hiked its dividend by 25% from $0.10/share to $0.125/share. In January 2015, another 20% dividend increase followed. Ford also keeps its dividend steady for four quarters before announcing a dividend increase. But Ford's recent dividend history is not the only reason why the company will likely raise its Q1-16 dividend. Ford Motor has seen robust sales growth in 2015, and since the F-150 is now being produced without any production restrictions, the auto maker is in a good position to continue to grow sales in 2016. Importantly, Ford's F-150 retail sales carry substantial earnings surprise potential, too, which makes Ford interesting from both a capital appreciation and income point of view. Ford Motor has historically increased its dividend at the beginning of the year. Though it is to be expected that Ford's dividend growth will continue to level off, I wouldn't be surprised if Ford declared a quarterly dividend of $0.17/share in order to keep shareholders happy, and maintain its tradition of steady dividend growth. A $0.17/share dividend implies a ~13% Y/Y growth rate, which is lower than in the past. In any case, investors will likely see an increasing yield on cost over time.
