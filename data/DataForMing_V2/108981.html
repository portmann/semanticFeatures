Fiat Chrysler Automobiles: Making The Right Moves In Europe - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (NYSE:FCAU) | Seeking Alpha FCAU has lost market share in Europe, which accounts for 22% of its sales, in the last couple of years, but the company is making a comeback this year. FCAU's growth in Europe in the January-May period has outpaced the industry average by a big margin, indicating that the company's strategy to improve sales is working. FCAU is focusing on the premium segment by investing in the Alfa Romeo brand as this will help it generate higher margins. FCAU has lined up a number of new cars going forward across all its brands that will help it increase its reach in the European market and consolidate its position. For Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (NYSE: FCAU ), Europe is an important market. This is evident from the fact that Fiat Chrysler got close to 19% of its revenue from the EMEA region last year. In fact, this region accounted for just over 22% of the company's overall shipments in fiscal 2014. However, Fiat's performance in this market has not been great in the past couple of years, as the company has been losing market share. For instance, in 2012, Fiat Chrysler's market share in Europe was 6.3%, but this number came down to 5.9% at the end of 2014. However, the good thing is that Fiat Chrysler has picked up strong momentum in Europe this year. It has shown impressive sales growth in each of the first five months of the year, while June sales data for Europe is yet to be declared. June results for Italy are out, and FCA reported a 20% year-over-year increase in sales as compared to last June. FCA's European sales for the Jan-May period were up 11.62% year-over-year to 384,300 vehicles. It saw double-digit growth in 3 out of these five months, which is impressive as shown in the following charts. Source: Data from Fiat Chrysler , charts by author In fact, FCA has beaten the European automobile industry's growth by huge margins in every month except January. While the industry has grown by 6.8% this year, FCA's sales have increased 11.62% from last year. In May, that gap was the widest of the five months with the industry growth at 1.59% while FCA's sales growth was 8.64%. More importantly, the impressive growth in FCA's sales has lead to an improvement in its market share. For example, its market share was 5.9% at the end of 2014, and this has now increased to 6.4% for this year's January-May period. Over the same period, major automakers like Volkswagen (OTCQX: VLKAY ) and General Motors (NYSE: GM ) have lost both money and market share in Europe. Thus, Fiat Chrysler has gained impressive momentum in the European market this year, and it is highly likely that this trend will continue going forward. Let's see why. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles announced last year that it will be investing 48 billion Euros till 2018 to boost its global sales to 7 million cars per year and multiply its net profit by five times. As a part of this strategy, the company will be utilizing its idled plant capacity in Italy to add jobs and re-hire workers who had been suspended earlier. It will also be investing money to strengthen its position in the fast-growing and higher-margin market for premium cars. Thus, going forward, Fiat Chrysler should ideally increase production from the Maserati and Alfa Romeo brands. Specifically, Fiat Chrysler management expects to achieve break even in Europe this year as a result of an increased focus on premium vehicles. For instance, FCA will be investing $7 billion in the Alfa Romeo brand over a period of four years to add 8 new models. Driven by this initiative, the company expects that sales from the brand will go up to 400,000 units annually from 74,000 units in 2013. In April this year, Fiat announced that it will produce two new engines for Alfa Romeo cars at the Group's plant in Termoli, which has an installed capacity of more than 200,000 units per year. A total of more than half a billion euros will be invested in the design, development, and engineering of the engines and the setting up of new production lines. Thus, it is evident that Fiat Chrysler is doing the right thing by focusing on its premium brands in order to capture growth in the European market. Fiat will be introducing various new models over the next 2 years under different nameplates. For instance, the Chrysler 100 will be unveiled in 2016. It is a compact sedan in the high volume segment in which the likes of the Honda Civic, the Toyota Corolla, and the Ford Focus are already present. Chrysler will also roll out a Town & Country minivan which will be a new generation, plug-in hybrid vehicle. In 2017, Chrysler will bring in an unnamed, full-size crossover SUV that will also have a plug-in hybrid option. In 2018, the next-generation 300 full-size sedan, as well as a new mid-size crossover SUV will be launched under the Chrysler series. Under the Dodge brand name, Fiat will launch a new subcompact sedan and hatchback in 2018 to compete with cars such as the Honda Fit, the Chevrolet Sonic, and the Ford Fiesta. Fiat will also expand its line-up of the four-door 500L by launching its larger, all-wheel drive version by the name 500X. Moreover, Fiat will be launching the Aegea concept in Europe in November this year. It will be replacing the Bravo hatchback and the Linea sedan. Aegea will be partly based on the Panda minicar concept, and will compete in the compact car segment with Europe's top-seller, Volkswagen Golf. In its investor day presentation for the EMEA region, Fiat has stressed on delivering a premium-quality experience across all brands. It will resize its dealer network to improve network sustainability. The focus will be on the Jeep brand, the Fiat 500 family, and the Alfa Romeo to reap the benefits of their brand equity. Moreover, FCA has plans to increase throughput by 60% and market coverage by 90% on an average for its main brands. As mentioned at the beginning of the article, Fiat Chrysler's market share has declined slightly over the past couple of years. This is because the likes of Ford (NYSE: F ) and Peugeot have been making smart moves in order to gain market share. This can be seen in the following chart: As can be seen clearly above, Ford has been able to improve its market share in Europe of late, and the trend could continue as the company is fast expanding its capacity in the region. For instance, in February this year, Ford completed a $2.6 billion investment in its Valencia, Spain, operations. As a result of this initiative, Ford has been able to improve its capacity at the plant to 450,000 units annually, which makes it one of Blue Oval's biggest plants. On the back of this plant, Ford can manufacture as many as six vehicles at a single facility, which will help it bring more new models into the market. For instance, Ford has recently introduced the Ford Galaxy seven passenger vehicle, with other new models such as the S-MAX, C MAX, Grand C-MAX, and C-MAX Energi plug-in hybrid electric vehicle in the pipeline. In addition, to target the luxury segment in the region, Ford is launching the Mustang in Europe. This will provide stiff competition to Fiat Chrysler's plan of improving its sales in the luxury segment since the Mustang is an iconic car that could create a dent in its sales. Although Fiat is a mid-table player in Europe in terms of market share, it is now gaining market share at a good pace. The company plans to make aggressive investments in capacity, new models, and the dealership network in order to improve its performance in this market. Since Fiat Chrysler gets around 22% of its sales from this market, this will have a positive impact on its overall performance. Thus, in my opinion, an improvement in Fiat Chrysler's sales in Europe should help the company do well in the long run.
