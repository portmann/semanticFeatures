Disney: The Fear Is Overblown - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Media stocks have been hammered over cord-cutting fears with DIS bears worrying about ESPN. ESPN results are stable, and given its proprietary content, the business is far from doomed even if we move away from the bundle. The rest of Disney's business continues to perform well, especially parks and the studio, which is poised for several years of growth. With an unparalleled number of leading brands, Disney's portfolio is positioned to win, and I would start to buy on this drop. The past few weeks have been very challenging for investors in the media stocks. Ever since Disney (NYSE: DIS ) CEO Bob Iger said ESPN suffered "some subscriber loss," the stocks have done nothing but fall. In the month of August, Disney is down 19%, AMC Networks (NASDAQ: AMCX ) 20%, CBS (NYSE: CBS ) 16%, Fox (NASDAQ: FOX ) (NASDAQ: FOXA ) 19%, and Viacom (NASDAQ: VIA ) (NASDAQ: VIAB ) 29%. That is not a fun ride; however, when it comes to Disney at least, I think investors are grossly overreacting. While investors have to be cautious about trying to "catch a falling knife," Disney looks like an attractive investment in my opinion and I would slowly add to/initiate a position here. One thing I feel confident about is that consumers will continue to watch content. People are always seeking entertainment, and providers of quality entertainment will be able to find an audience and make money off their product. What is uncertain is the platform the content is delivered on, whether it be via cable, over the internet directly to consumers, or via a different platform altogether. Importantly, I believe Disney has a diverse set of offerings that will continue to thrive in a new technological environment. First, the primary concern is around ESPN, which is a key driver of results. Disney's media networks generate around 54% of the company's operating income with a run-rate north of $7 billion, and cable (predominately ESPN) accounts for about 87% of the Media Network's income. Clearly, ESPN is a critical piece of the Disney puzzle. However, things are not exactly falling apart. Operating income rose 7% last quarter and will be roughly flat in all of 2015. Given some projects at other Disney divisions, growth elsewhere should exceed ESPN's growth over the next 3-4 years, meaning it over time will be slightly less important. A lot of the concern on ESPN is that consumers will move into skinner bundles and skip ESPN altogether. Clearly with earnings running flattish, that is not happening in significant numbers yet. Additionally, Disney has contracts in place with cable companies protecting its place in the bundle for several years, meaning this issue would be more a slow drag than a sudden collapse. The rationale for a total collapse also does not seem to be there. Americans love sports, and unlike scripted content, sports need to be watched live, otherwise the results will inevitably be spoiled (just try DVRing the Super Bowl or NBA Finals and watching the next night without someone at office spoiling the results). There will continue to demand for ESPN, especially as it continues to monopolize sports content by having programs like Monday Night Football and the NCAA Football Championship. In fact, ESPN could be a winner in an "un-bundled" world. As more and more consumers watch scripted TV via other means or on their own schedule, ESPN has become a reason many have cable in the first place. Over time, Disney could follow HBO's model , which now offers a direct-to-consumer offering for $15. For consumers only really interested in sports, it would be cheaper to pay directly for ESPN than buying ESPN bundled with rarely-watched channels. While ESPN gets about $5 from the cable companies, it could sell directly to consumers for more, maybe $10-$15 like ESPN. Even if it loses subscribers, it would earn more per subscriber, leaving total results unimpacted. Thanks to proprietary content, ESPN is not necessarily a loser. While ESPN is clearly important, investors make a mistake by focusing on it and ignoring the rest of Disney's businesses. Disney's theme parks continue to perform well with earnings up 16% year to date to $2.3 billion. Disney's Shanghai park will be opening soon, which should provide a boon to Disney's park results given how popular its Marvel Characters are. Disney also plans on rolling out Star Wars Lands to parks; its stable of characters continues to grow, which should continue to boost demand. That is why I would also highlight how well the studio is doing. While the studio is less than 20% of profits at $1.4 billion, its importance exceeds that. Disney's films can provide revenue for its consumer products division (think Iron Man toys for instance), content for its networks (like Agents of SHIELD), and attractions for its parks. They keep the Disney brand fresh with new, popular characters. The studio should continue to perform well for the next few years with Star Wars 7 launching in December, followed by sequels and spin-offs in future years. The Marvel world continues to expand beyond the Avengers with additions like Ant-Man and Spider-Man to core franchises like Iron Man. Pixar is also as popular as ever as witnessed by the success of Inside Out and pending sequels to Finding Nemo and Toy Story in future years. Looking at Disney's film slate as well as its new China Park leaves me feeling very excited about the company's prospects. It also seems like the naysayers over ESPN may be too negative, given its exclusive content and dominance over sports, which remains one of Americans' primary source of entertainment. Disney's diversified portfolio of brands should power growth for years. As witnessed by its Marvel films which have followed a 10-year plan, Disney is long-term strategic thinker under Iger. Disney should earn over $5 this fiscal year (ending September) and north of $5.65 next year with 8-12% growth to follow for several years given its large film slate, China park, and modest network growth. Disney is now 17.5x fiscal 2016 earnings. For one of the world's most powerful brands with a powerful content backlog, I think valuation is starting to get interesting again. With some of the most popular content around, I think Disney is poised to win in most environments as consumers will want to pay for its content, and if it can do for Stars Wars what it has done for Marvel, there could be another leg to its studio's growth. With 10% earnings growth for some time, I still think fair value is closer to 20x or $113. Under $100, Disney looks attractive, though I would caution that near-term momentum remains to the downside. As a consequence, I would buy a little here, and if the stock falls into the low $90s, I would buy more to fill out the position.
