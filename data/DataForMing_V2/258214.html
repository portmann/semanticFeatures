Intel: Selling Up The Stack To Knights Landing - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha The SC15 (2015 Super Computing conference) highlighted the revolutionary impact HPC (High Performance Computing) is having on our lives. HPC takes science from experimentation and interpretive analysis and allows predictive simulation and modeling to solve previously unsolvable complex problems in areas such as weather, medicine, manufacturing and space. HPC also is revolutionizing itself by using predictive simulations and modeling to make faster, more efficient and more useful HPC processors, communications systems and applications. The democratization of HPC use in the Cloud is an Intel goal (Cloud for All, HPC Everywhere) with the result that Data Centers will continue to buy up the stack. Knights Landing processors are in use now at Cray, Sandia National Laboratories and CEA supercomputing facilities. 50-plus systems will us Intel Xeon Phi product family-based systems in the market. At SC15, Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) General Manager of the Data Center Group Diane Bryant and six key Intel staff working on HPC (high-performance computing) talked about how HPC Everywhere is revolutionizing science. The SC15 video is a must see for anyone interested in how Intel DCG will exceed 15% CAGR for at least the next four years. Often dismissed as small dollar sales and not moving the Intel revenue needle, HPC is now going mainstream and becoming accessible beyond huge corporations, academia and government. The Maker movement is a strong impetus to broader use of HPC in the Cloud. Makers understand the value and importance of HPC and are eager to have access to the predictive simulation and modeling that was previously simply not possible. HPC is being democratized and is becoming available through the cloud to medium and small businesses, health organizations and Makers. One example was the use of HPC to model air flow around a semi-truck resulting in design improvements that will save millions of dollars of fuel. Another example is using HPC to perform predictive simulation, complex gnome pattern recognition and modeling to find cures for Parkinson's and other diseases. As it becomes more and more available, HPC will allow predictive simulation, pattern recognition and modeling uses that we cannot even conceive of doing at this point. Even today, HPC is being used to design Intel's 5nm processor performing complex predictive simulation and modeling at the atomic level as needed to achieve the 5nm node. Machine learning will further accelerate the democratization of HPC by allowing development of more advanced chips, communications and applications and by revolutionizing the way complex problems are solved. SSF is touted as critical to the success of democratizing HPC. Intel's system approach is to use an Omni-Path Architecture including a new HPC-optimized fabric technology that makes the performance of HPC clusters more accessible to a broader variety of users. OPA is an end-to-end fabric solution that cost-effectively improves the performance of HPC applications for entry level to large-scale HPC clusters. The system includes fabric (see animation of how it works ) to tie memory and storage more closely to the processor to achieve dramatically better performance. Intel's OPA includes the fabric connecting memory/storage to the CPU, ports, switches and interface adapters - an end-to-end solution. Intel Xeon Phi Processors (code-named Knights Landing) At SC15 Intel announced that preproduction Intel Xeon Phi processors (code-named Knights Landing) are running in several supercomputing-class systems. Cray has a system currently running multiple customer applications in preparation for the supercomputer deployments at Los Alamos (Trinity system) and NERSC (Cori system). Systems also are installed at CEA (the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission) by Atos and Sandia National Laboratories by Penguin Computing. Intel expects more than 50 system providers to have Intel Xeon Phi product family-based systems in the market. With 72 active cores Intel likes to say it does not need acceleration ( no need for NVIDIA GPUs ). I note that the Xeon Phi is no longer referred to as a coprocessor, just a processor. The Xeon Phi can replace a Xeon processor and an NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA ) accelerator. There is much less need for an accelerator from NVIDIA now. This Xeon Phi processor will see ubiquitous use throughout the cloud and by anybody wanting to make use of Big Data analytics, predictive simulation and complex modeling. The Xeon Phi coprocessor currently sells for $4,000 -plus. The Xeon E7 processor sells for over $10,000 . Sell 100,000 of these and we are talking a billion dollars. The DCG has shown great strength in selling up the stack to better processor chips and components. Each time Intel data center clients buy, they buy a better processor and associated equipment. By providing the new Xeon Phi, Intel is providing yet another opportunity for data centers to buy up the stack to higher-priced equipment. To make HPC more accessible and easier to use, Intel is among more than 30 founding members of the OpenHPC Collaborative Project, a new community-led organization focused on developing a comprehensive and cohesive open source HPC system software stack to drive broader adoption. Intel-supported versions of the open source HPC system software stack are expected to be available in 2016. Intel also is expanding HPC ecosystem support and investments with the creation of five new Intel Parallel Computing Centers focused on Lustre software development. HPC is but one component of Intel achieving 15% CAGR in the DCG . Along with general Cloud computing and network virtualization Intel's democratization of HPC will significantly grow DCG revenues . Currently only 10% of the servers worldwide have HPC processors. Intel will put HPC Everywhere... in the Cloud and out of the Cloud. Intel's HPC offerings create a great opportunity for data centers to provide much needed resources required for today's Big Data Analytics and predictive simulation. $4,000 to $10,000 Xeon Phi processors along with Omni-Path systems will help drive DCG revenue growth I think well beyond 15% CAGR in coming years.
