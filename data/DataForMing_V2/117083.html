Boeing, aerospace segment "has legs," J.P. Morgan analyst says - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha To screen ETFs by asset class, performance, yield and more, check out the ETF Hub. ETF Hub Jul 14 2015, 19:40 ET | About: The Boeing Company (BA) | By: Carl Surran , SA News Editor The commercial aerospace segment still provides  opportunities for double-digit gains over the next 18 months, as the " aero cycle has legs ," J.P. Morgan analyst Seth Seifman says, initiating coverage of Boeing (NYSE: BA ) and several peers with Overweight ratings. Boeing’s cash flow outlook has been controversial, but Seifman views 787 unit cost reduction as a powerful driver that can push free cash flow to $9.1B in 2017 , 44% above 2015 estimates with potential for growth beyond; Seifman sees the precedent Boeing set by returning $8B of cash last year as a signal of confidence in future cash flow. General Dynamics' (NYSE: GD ) balance sheet might drive upside, while Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT ) could use its financial strength to create value, but Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC ) is started at Underweight, as the analyst sees "fewer arrows left in the quiver"  and expectations may be too high following recent outperformance in its  shares.
