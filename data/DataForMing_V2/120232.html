Netflix - Zero Regard For Cash Flow Concerns - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Netflix (NFLX) turned up a phenomenal quarter in terms of subscriber growth, but a horrendous quarter in terms of free cash flow. Obviously the market values "views" over profits. This report highlights the subscriber growth trends and breaks down the cash flow burn over the past 3 years. I recommend avoiding Netflix and potentially shorting via long-term puts. There is phenomenal downside if the "clicks and eyeballs" investment mantra falls apart. Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) reported their results yesterday afternoon, 15 July 2015, and the stock has since popped upward by nearly 15%. The overall success of the NFLX model depends on what type of analyst or investor is studying the model, but obviously the market is in favor of the "subscriber growth is all that matters" approach. In terms of subscriber growth, NFLX had a truly phenomenal quarter, and I'm not attempting to negate any of their achievement there. However, in terms of cash flow, NFLX produced a disastrous business quarter all in effort to continue to promote "worldwide growth." Netflix has burned through more cash in the past six months than in the 3 previous years (2012-2014) combined. I urge potential Netflix "investors" to use caution when playing with such a potentially volatile stock. The following report highlights the subscriber growth trends and examines the current cash flow bleed. Subscriber growth in Q2-15 was very impressive- surpassing my estimates and even the average analyst projections. I have nothing negative to say about subscriber growth. Domestic streaming and DVD growth continues to slow on a y/y basis, but international growth saw a nice up-tick. I have attached charts below which slow the relative gains. Note that domestic subscriber growth continues to slow a bit, but is still holding steady around 17%. International growth saw a nice uptick from the addition of new markets. This lead to an increase in the overall growth rate, which is certainly bullish from a "subscriber growth only" mindset. Note that the Q2-15 uptick was the first reversal of the collapsing growth curve since international expansion began in 2011. The chart below tells the entire story of NFLX's cash flow position. During the past 6 months, NFLX has burnt more cash than in the previous 3 years combined. Despite the stories about Netflix gaining ground or approaching global dominance, the business itself is completely falling apart. The bullish thesis is that Hastings and crew can quickly jack up subscription revenue "just in time" to save the business and then eventually earn massive profits. The problem is any price-hikes risk a complete collapse for the "growth" model, so NFLX finds themselves in a Catch-22 scenario. Netflix currently trades 100% on subscriber growth, with little regard for cash flow or income figures. This "cash burn" scenario is only getting worse as NFLX continues to push its international expansion. Prices hikes across the board, the only possible way for NFLX to earn (NASDAQ: CASH ) profit, are off the table according to Reed Hastings on yesterday's conference call . Investors are enjoying a roller coaster ride with euphoria that reminds me of my favorite episode of the Happy Tree Friends (caution: cartoon violence/comedy). This roller coaster ride isn't going to end well for those with blinders. Traders and momentum speculators are pushing this stock higher and higher on a more modern variant of "clicks and eyeballs," and I fear for a massive retail correction once hopes and dreams transition to reality. The stock remains absurdly overvalued and is burning cash at a tremendous pace. With the current content spend plans for 2H-16 and 2016, NFLX could easily be forced to hit the debt markets again next year. The whole situation feels eerily familiar to mid-2011 when the entire focus was placed on future Latin America expansion. I still remember the forecasts for $6.50 in EPS by 2012. Well here we are in 2015, and the EPS will be lucky to hit 50c. Source: Netflix - Zero Regard For Cash Flow Concerns Disclosure: I am/we are short NFLX.
