Verizon And Yahoo: 2 + 2 = 6 - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha Verizon's CEO Lowell McAdam acknowledges interest in Yahoo. Yahoo's CFO Kenneth Goldman is bullish on Yahoo's core business auction process. Tuesday May 24, 2016 marked a very interesting day at the 44th annual JPMorgan technology, media, and telecom conference in Boston MA. The second day of the conference featured Verizon's (NYSE: VZ ) CEO Lowell McAdam and Yahoo's (NASDAQ: YHOO ) CFO Kenneth Goldman both contributing juicy tidbits in the contentious drama that is the ongoing sale of Yahoo's core business. Verizon has publicly expressed interest in Yahoo multiple times and Yahoo is desperate to succeed in any sale or spinoff of its business to create shareholder value. Verizon is seen as the lead actor in a cast of players vying for all or parts of Yahoo's core business and today's remarks by company insiders confirm and strengthen that thesis. Verizon just recently received an earnings downgrade from Wells Fargo . This downgrade comes as almost 40,000 of the company's workers continue a strike started on April 13, 2016 with little progress being made by either side in negotiations. Verizon's CEO Lowell McAdam also lowered expectations at the conference on the company's Go90 mobile video service that is off to a slow start, to say the least, among its targeted audiences ( article ). With a lot of bad press in the news lately, what better way to change the sentiment of Verizon than to successfully close on some or all of Yahoo's core business as a high bidder. With a market cap exceeding $200 billion, annual revenues of over $130 billion, and around $5 billion in free cash on its balance sheet, Verizon has the ability to take as large a chunk of Yahoo's core business as it wants. Verizon has the ability to buy core Yahoo, but what reason does the company have to spend above and beyond what the other bidders are willing to spend is the question. McAdam said at the conference "... we can't talk about Yahoo, but that's a possibility to gain greater scale." Building scale among its internet and video properties such as AOL and Go90 will create synergies by growing revenues and cutting costs that other bidders for Yahoo's assets can not achieve. Yahoo's CFO Kenneth Goldman also gave a presentation that Tuesday, and naturally, the sale of the company's core business was on everyone's mind. Yahoo failed in an attempt to spin off its Ali Baba (NYSE: BABA ) stake late last year in a tax free manner so pressure has built last year and this year on getting anything done to create some value whether that is a reverse spin of the company's core or sale of some or all of it to another company. Goldman said at the conference "We are taking it extremely seriously" and that the upcoming sale was taking up the majority of top executives' time. "It's our collective goal that we find a way, wherever this ends up, that ultimately Yahoo will do better with the benefit of however it goes than staying independent." Yahoo is under immense pressure to get a deal done, no matter what, and Verizon is in the best position to capitalize on this desperation. Goldman reiterated that the second round of the auction is a "robust process" involving multiple bidders and "it's going, I think, very very well." I wrote a previous article on Yahoo further explaining the current bidding process and players, but what makes Verizon such a good partner for Yahoo? The answer is the scale that a sale can create for Verizon. Verizon bought AOL last year for $4.4 billion and brought its former CEO and Chairman Tim Armstrong over to Verizon to run it. This integration has gone very well according to insiders and McAdam said at the JPMorgan conference that AOL's first quarter was "their best quarter in five years, so that's kind of working." Verizon acquiring Yahoo's core business works because Tim Armstrong is already there to head the integration of Yahoo into Verizon's media and video assets. Eliminate what isn't working for Yahoo, and what is redundant in the bigger company, and you can bring down costs while growing revenues which is building scale. McAdam said during the conference in regard to Tim Armstrong and Verizon's internet and video business goals that "two plus two should at least equal six." I believe that purchasing Yahoo's core business does equal six for Verizon at a price that could be acceptable to both parties. Verizon buying all or part of Yahoo makes sense because Verizon has the means, Yahoo is desperate to sell, and the combined company should create scale in a way that benefits Verizon much more so than other bidders in Yahoo's core business auction. Tuesday, May 24, 2016's JPMorgan conference reinforced that view as both Verizon's CEO and Yahoo's CFO hinted at the process moving forward favorably towards completion. With the market valuing Yahoo's core business at very little when you back out its stakes in Ali Baba, Yahoo Japan, and its cash, any sale of some or all of its core business should create additional shareholder value which is why I am long Yahoo.
