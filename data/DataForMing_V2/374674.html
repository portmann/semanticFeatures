Another Way To Pay amazon Selfie Pay patent application payment verification MasterCard may have rolled out its new â€œselfieâ€? verification system last month, but itâ€™s not the only company to take consumersâ€™ love of self portraits and turn it into a way to make money. To that end, Amazon recently filed a patent for a so-called selfie pay system.Â  The service, which is related to another patent Amazon already owns that allows for photo verification of a shopper, aims to make it safer for shoppers to buy things online, Re/Code reports. According to the patent application , Amazon customers would be able to make a purchase by taking a photo and/or video of themselves rather than keying in their account password. â€œAs people are utilizing computing devices for an increasing variety of tasks, there is a corresponding need to improve the security available for these tasks,â€? Amazon says in the patent application. â€œWhile many conventional approaches rely on password entry for user authentication, these passwords can be stolen or discovered by other persons who can impersonate the user for any of a variety of tasks.â€? Additionally, Amazon contends that using passwords on portable devices is â€œnot user friendly in many cases, as the small touchscreen or keyboard elements can be difficult to accurately select using a relatively large human finger, and can require the user to turn away from friends or co-workers when entering a password, which can be awkward or embarrassing in many situations.â€? As a result, the company is working on its own selfie pay application. Under the system, a transaction is authorized using an â€œauthentication process that prompts the user to perform an action in view of a camera or sensor.â€? Much like MasterCardâ€™s selfie verification system â€“ which requires that the user blink to confirm they aren’t merely holding up a photo â€“ Amazon’s technology necessitates the user to perform â€œan action indicative of a physical person, such as by blinking or making another such motion.â€? The device – a smartphone, tablet, or computer â€” then verifies that the image information corresponds to a living human using one or more human-verification processes.
