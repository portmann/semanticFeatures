Apple's March Event: Bad Timing - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple has sent out invites for its March 21 event. Shortly after noon on Thursday, we received word Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has sent out invites for an event later this month, to be held on March 21. Apple says "Let us loop you in" in the invite, and is expected to launch a new iPhone, new iPad and perhaps some Apple Watch accessories at the event. Unfortunately, the timing of the event is a little later than previously thought, which might impact results for the current quarter. Most reports previously had Apple holding this event on March 15, with sales to start March 18. That would have been next week, but obviously Apple can't sell products on the 18th if it is not holding the event until the following week. Given the company's history of new product sales starting on a Friday, it would seem that at least one (if not both) of these new devices would be available on Friday, March 25. The timing pushback of this event is key, because Apple's current fiscal Q2 ends on March 26. If sales don't start until the 25th, that means just two selling days as opposed to nine if the original report of the 18th was true. Even though neither of these products are game-changers for Apple, a week's worth of revenue for either would still be quite significant. A million units of each would roughly equate to a billion dollars in revenue for Apple, and at least a few pennies of earnings per share. With a number of people looking to upgrade to a new 4-inch iPhone , it's not crazy to think that a week's worth of unit sales could be in the millions at the start. When Apple reported its previous quarter , the company guided to fiscal Q2 revenue of $50 billion to $53 billion. That was a bit weaker than most expected, forcing analysts to cut their numbers. As of Thursday afternoon, most are still fairly positive on the quarter despite all the fear we've heard of iPhone sales. According to Yahoo! Finance , the analyst average for quarterly revenues is $52 billion, above the company's midpoint. If we look at Estimize (need to register to view), the crowdsourced site that sometimes has had better results, the mean forecast is more bullish, at $52.647 billion. So you can see why the later-than-expected timing of this event can be a bit of a problem. Even if sales start the day of the event, the company is losing a few sales days at the end of its quarter, and losing a weekend as well. That is likely to push these sales into fiscal Q3, so perhaps those estimates may need to increase a little. Even a few hundred million in revenues could be the difference between Apple reporting a miss versus a decent beat, especially if the "whisper number" is above the Street average. In the end, I don't think Apple's current or prospective shareholders should do anything crazy based on this news. It is simply a matter of timing, so you should just expect a little softer Q2 but a little better Q3. The key to Apple in the long term is delivering high-quality products to convince current users to upgrade. Between now and Apple's earnings report in April, I will track analyst estimates to see how things change based on this event news. I expect that we will see some revisions downward for Q2.
