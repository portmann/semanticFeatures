Spielberg's DreamWorks to split from Disney: Hollywood Reporter | Reuters Reuters/Lukasz Krajewski/Agencja Gazeta DreamWorks Studios, the film company co-founded by Steven Spielberg, will split from Walt Disney Co after the release of his film, "The BFG," the Hollywood Reporter said, citing people familiar with the matter. The director's likely future home is Universal and is in talks with the company, according to the report on Wednesday. ( bit.ly/1ii1C5G ) Spielberg's take on "The BFG," based on British author Roald Dahl's 1982 book, is scheduled for release on July 1, 2016. Universal Studios, Walt Disney and DreamWorks could not immediately be reached for comment. Disney Studios signed a long-term, exclusive film distribution agreement with DreamWorks Studios principals Steven Spielberg and Stacey Snider in 2009. The original agreement provided for the distribution and marketing of about six live-action films per year for DreamWorks as part of Spielberg and Snider's partnership with India's Reliance Big Entertainment. "Jurassic World," which rebooted Spielberg's "Jurassic Park" dinosaur franchise, has become the third highest-grossing film in history, behind James Cameron's "Titanic" and "Avatar." A sequel to the film is slated for a 2018 release, Comcast Corp's Universal Pictures said in July. "The studio would welcome the chance to be DreamWorks' distribution partner" but any deal is premature, a Universal source was quoted as saying by the Hollywood Reporter.
