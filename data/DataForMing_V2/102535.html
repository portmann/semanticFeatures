The Most Logical Way To Play Yahoo's Pullback - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha YHOO has underperformed Alibaba over the last few months, and its stake has now risen from 75% to 85% of its market capitalization. Yahoo's valuation minus Alibaba is only $6.2 billion, meaning that its stake in Yahoo Japan and core business has been deemed worthless. Given these things, I have set a fair company value of $60 billion. Depending on how Yahoo trades throughout this year, that market cap target could mean upside of 50% or could give it multi-bagger potential. Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) scored a very high rating of 91 on my numeric research platform, making it fifth among stocks covered thus far for the most upside. Needless to say, I like Yahoo, but the reason has nothing to do with its short-term upside, or the business itself. Instead, there's a level of value in its sum-of-parts that suggests only one logical response to Yahoo's 23% stock loss this year. As most know, Yahoo owns 15% of Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ), a stake currently worth $31 billion. That's nearly 85% of Yahoo's current market capitalization, up significantly from the near 75% of Yahoo's market cap back in late March. The reason is because Yahoo's stock has underperformed Alibaba since that time, thereby increasing the value of Yahoo's stake relative to its own valuation. That said, one reason that Yahoo has performed so bad in recent months is because of fears that the government will prevent the spinoff later this year of its Alibaba stake, SpinCo. Specifically, there are fears that the IRS will make changes to the tax code, perhaps targeted at Yahoo's tax-free spinoff. While there's no way to know for certain, I view this as highly unlikely. For one, Yahoo may not pay taxes on the spinoff, but taxes on that stake will be paid when investors sell. Therefore, it's not as if the IRS won't receive its money. And to block the spinoff would almost be a deterrent for companies to make future foreign investments, like the one that Yahoo made in Alibaba. In other words, why punish Yahoo for making a good investment? With that said, even if Yahoo's spinoff were to be blocked, somehow, and it had to find another way to divest the stake, it's not as if the holding becomes worthless. Yahoo would still own 15% of a $207 billion company and would just have to find another way to divest it. So no matter what happens, it is not the end of the world for Yahoo. Granted, I fully expect the spinoff of Alibaba to occur as scheduled later this year. If it were to happen right now, based on both companies' current valuation, Yahoo would have a market capitalization of only $6.2 billion. It's that post-SpinCo valuation that makes Yahoo such a clear cut buying opportunity, almost undisputable. After all, if you remove Alibaba and Yahoo Japan from its market capitalization, there's nothing left of Yahoo. That's because Yahoo owns 35% of Yahoo Japan at a valuation of $8.8 billion. Therefore, Yahoo's $4.7 billion a year core business and the $6.9 billion cash pile on its balance sheet are worthless to investors at its current price. Yahoo is a company that's still planning to buy back $2.5 billion of its stock, but if the stock keeps trading lower or doesn't trade considerably higher, there won't be anything left to buy back, and $2.5 billion could theoretically take the company private. The bottom line is that investors should expect the market to realize this upside as the spinoff grows near, and at the very least for Yahoo's market capitalization to properly reflect its sum of parts. While I typically use Tipping the Scale to provide price targets, I will say that I believe Yahoo is worth every bit of $60 per share, even at Alibaba's current valuation. Combined, the above formula would value Yahoo at $60 billion, or a price well over $60 per share. That's fair value. Depending on how Alibaba trades from this point forward, fair value could fluctuate. With all things considered, investors should not be discouraged by the volatility in Yahoo. Ideally, Yahoo will remain undervalued for the next few months, which would create the opportunity for exceptionally large stock gains following SpinCo. As previously explained, if SpinCo were established today, Yahoo's market capitalization would be $6.2 billion. However, there's a $30 billion difference in the value of Yahoo's remaining assets and its Alibaba stake. This means that once SpinCo is established, Yahoo should still be worth $30 billion based on its remaining sum of parts. In retrospect, that's why investors shouldn't be discouraged by volatile trading or even a loss in Yahoo shares right now. If SpinCo is established, and Yahoo's remaining value less than $10 billion, it will have the capabilities to create substantial upside through buybacks alone , and the value of its Yahoo Japan stake relative to Yahoo's valuation (post-Alibaba) will be even more significant than its Alibaba stake. In other words, Yahoo is set up for some very large gains. Source: The Most Logical Way To Play Yahoo's Pullback Disclosure: I am/we are long YHOO.
