Reuters/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo SEOUL South Korea's Fair Trade Commission (FTC) is investigating "some matters" relating to tech giant Apple Inc (AAPL.O), the head of the anticompetition body said during a parliamentary hearing, without disclosing further details. Speaking at the hearing on Tuesday, FTC Chairman Jeong Jae-chan declined to comment on the specifics of the regulator's investigation when asked to do so by a South Korean lawmaker. Domestic media reports said earlier this month the FTC was reviewing details of the U.S. firm's contracts with South Korean mobile telecoms carriers. Apple didn't immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Reuters News Agency | Brand Attribution Guidelines | Delivery Options Reuters is the news and media division of Thomson Reuters .
