The WinTel Alliance Dominates Again In Laptops - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha I pity AMD’s Carizzo notebook CPU product. It’s all Intel-inside for new Windows 10 laptops. Even budget-phone vendor Micromax chose Intel with its first ever laptop product. I like it very much that Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) stock price is now above $32. Good propaganda on Seeking Alpha often does influence the outlook of many investors. I'm therefore publishing more good news for INTC believers. Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ ), which previously signed-up to market Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Surface Pro to its enterprise clients, unveiled its own Windows 10 version of the Surface Pro. Like Dell, Hewlett-Packard is not going to play as a mere subordinate/minion to Microsoft's ambitious plan to saturate the enterprise market with Surface computers. The Spectre x2 is Hewlett-Packard's latest tablet/laptop for its enterprise clients. I like it also that HP will go all-Skylake for its latest Windows 10 laptops. The Spectre 2's CPU is better than the Core M variety that is found inside the 2015 MacBook. Aside from giving Intel the processor supply deal, HP's latest laptop also comes equipped with a RealSense Camera and premium Bang & Olufsen audio. The basic model of the HP Spectre 2 will retail for $800. Budget-constrained corporations who are intimidated with the $1,499 basic price tag of the Surface Book would therefore likely consider HP's much cheaper Spectre 2 or the Surface Pro 4. It doesn't really matter if HP will promote Spectre 2 over Surface Pro when it makes sales presentations to corporate buyers. Intel will still benefit from HP's use of the RealSense Camera and Skylake Core m-series processors. Just like Dell, Hewlett-Packard is one of the world's top vendors of laptop/notebook computers. The next version of the more expensive HP Spectre 2 360 2-in-1 laptop will also feature a Skylake CPU and RealSense Camera. Microsoft's new Hello feature for Windows 10 really requires PC manufacturers to equip their new high-end products with Intel's superior facial recognition capable RealSense 3D Camera. Microsoft doesn't really mind that its enterprise market distribution partners are creating clones of its trendsetting Surface Pro. Dell also released its own top-of-the-line clone of the Surface Pro. Microsoft even announced the Intel-powered Dell XPS 12 2-in-1 hybrid laptop/tablet on its official blog. Like Hewlett-Packard, Dell rebooted its XPS line of laptops to go all-Skylake . The Dell XPS 12's best features are its touch-friendly 4K Ultra HD 12-inch display and the detachable magnetic keyboard. The Dell XPS 15 laptop also touts a touch-screen 4K display and a discrete Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) GeForce 960M GPU. The Nvidia-powered Dell XPS 15 will likely compete with the pricey Surface Book, which also has a secret new GPU from Nvidia. INTC is still a Buy at $32+++ price levels. The continuing decline in PC sales is annoying. However, the introduction of touch-enabled Windows 10 laptops and desktop computers might eventually reverse this trend. I opine that consumers will get back to buying more laptops once all OEMs retire their outdated non-touchscreen computer products. Buyers are wiser now. Instead of them buying a separate laptop and a tablet, they now expect the 2-in-1 tablet/notebook form factor to be the new norm. Dell and Hewlett-Packard are just two important supporters/tailwinds for the new Intel Skylake processors. These two global PC giants' snub of Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ: AMD ) Carizzo processor is one more reason to add more INTC shares. I do not doubt that Carizzo SoC is competent even for high-end Windows 10 laptops. The only problem for Dr. Lisa Su (AMD's CEO) is that leading PC manufacturers remain loyal to Intel. It also very depressing for AMD that even small OEMs like Micromax went Intel inside for its first-ever laptop product. The 11.6-inch Micromax Canvas LapBook is a Windows 10 laptop for the Indian market. It retails for Rs 13,999 ($288.15) and it is equipped with an 4th Gen Intel Atom quad-core CPU. It might be presumptuous of me but I think AMD will not survive for long under Intel's assault. AMD investors should think really hard. Nobody seems to be interested in playing the white knight and rescue AMD from Intel's continuing encroachment of its already tiny PC processor market. I opine that it would be an act of mercy if Intel purchases the recently spun-off Radeon Technologies division. This sale will be substantial money to poor, marginalized/ostracized AMD. Common sense is telling me that separating Radeon from its core CPU business gives AMD the opportunity to entice third-party firms who might want to buy Nvidia's only remaining rival. Once it has its own GPU division, Intel could possibly exert its strong influence over PC manufacturers, so that some of them would drop Nvidia GPUs in favor of Intel-owned discrete Radeon video cards. Supplying both the CPU and discrete CPU is definitely better than Intel just selling the processor to WinTel computers. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
