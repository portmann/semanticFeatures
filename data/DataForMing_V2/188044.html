Capital Lease Confusion, Amazon's Financial Engineering Strategy For Amazon Web Services - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Using the methodology of one investment adviser and correcting for missed capitalized lease rents, Amazon's stock is way overvalued. Amazon is using capital leases because of how they are presented in financial statements, causing tech analysts not used to seeing these financial engineering strategies to omit cash flows. Amazon should improve its lease disclosures and provide forward capital expenditure guidance on both cash and capitalized lease PP&E investments to clear up the confusion. Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN ) capital lease investments mean Amazon's stock price target should be $381 per share, not $698 as one investment bank calculated, and Amazon's disclosures are the reason for analyst and investor confusion. Amazon is regularly criticized for limiting information it provides to the investment community. In the post Sarbanes-Oxley Act era, financial presentation obfuscation is a head-scratcher, especially when it relates to basic financial detail. Something as simple as segmenting lease accounting from other forms of debt and cash flows is not going to reveal anything proprietary about Amazon's business, unless the company's business is to intentionally confuse and mislead analysts and investors. When reviewing Amazon's financial presentations, which are at the very least unique, it's hard not to conclude that the company is engaged in some sleight-of-hand. A great article on Amazon's cash flow metric can be found here . After reviewing one major investment bank's analytical report issued after Amazon's Q2 2015 earnings release, it's clear to me that the tech analyst community doesn't fully understand the financial strategy behind leases and the underlying accounting. On September 29, 2015, Amazon's stock closed at $496 per share. This article will walk the reader through Credit Suisse's (NYSE: CS ) July 2015 incorrect computations for Amazon's valuation at $698 per share. This article will then recalculate the target price for Amazon to be $381 per share using the investment bank's own methodology, but correcting the mistakes the analyst made around Amazon's lease financing. Table 1 is Credit Suisse's long-range forecast for Amazon published on July 24th, 2015. The report was obtained from Charles Schwab and is widely disseminated among financial advisors. You can bet a large number of retail investors rely on this report for their investment decisions. Credit Suisse's valuation model calculated a $698 price target for Amazon's stock. You will note that the assumption for Amazon's 2016 to 2020 sales growth is strong and the bank's expectation for increasing net income is substantial. The calculations for the price target are presented later in this article. The problem with CS' model is that it omits cash flows associated with capital and financing lease investments. Capital and financing leases are capitalized and their cash rents show up reclassified in the income and cash flow statements just as you would see debt; just labeled a bit differently. As shown in Chart 1, Amazon's trailing twelve-month ("TTM") investment outlays for both cash and capital lease financed property plant and equipment ("PP&E") was $9.3 billion as of June 30, 2015, and growing at a 39.3% compound annual growth rate "CAGR". Capital lease financing is growing at a very fast 66.7% CAGR. Clearly, the rents are growing at a similar rate. A reader reviewing the CS report and looking at the expenses would expect to see interest expense growing, or in lieu of growing interest expense, growing investments in PP&E; however, that is not what is occurring in the CS valuation model. The PP&E investments in the CS forecast appear to only be for the investments classified as "purchases of property and equipment (incl. internal-use software & website development)". These PP&E investments do not include the investments made using capitalized leases. CS looks like it missed the capitalized lease cash flows altogether. For growth capital, lease obligations are one of the most contentious and complex accounting mechanisms and financial engineering solutions a company can use. Lease arrangements come in three flavors: operating, capital and financing. Operating leases are recorded as an expense and are differently presented on the company's financial statements from capital and financing leases, but that does not mean that operating leases are not long-lived obligations. As of June 30, 2015, Amazon's operating lease commitments totaled $6.1 billion, indicating on average approximately a six-year lease term. The focus of this article is directed more toward Amazon's capital lease activity because that seems to be more directly connected to the AWS growth. The questions an investor should ask are, why would a company suddenly transition away from acquiring equipment with retained earnings (or debt and equity) to utilizing capital lease arrangements for equipment like servers? Is the company unable to borrow debt or raise equity? Are retained earnings insufficient? Is the lease transaction a better cost/benefit transaction? Is a lease the only option a vendor offers the company? Is the company purposefully using capital lease financing because of how it shows up (or does not show up) in the cash flow measures used for valuing Amazon? Amazon's financial presentations emphasize growth and cash flows, and that's appropriate. Unfortunately, the CS model indicates that Amazon's disclosures are confusing to the investment community. After reviewing other analyst recommendations and the forecasts used to base their recommendations, it doesn't appear the confusion is limited to just one financial advisor. It is apparent the market is excited about Amazon's growth prospects, but it is much less clear that investors and even professional analysts understand the investment needs and lease financial strategies Amazon is utilizing to drive Amazon's revenue growth, especially for AWS. I regularly find analyzes that publish a 40 times or so multiple on Amazon's EBITDA. Here is a link to a recent Forbes article (linked to the author's blog) calculating Amazon's EV/EBITDA multiple at "43.9". The "40ish" multiple is seemingly more in line with other growth companies as shown in the article's comparisons, but unfortunately, calculating Amazon's current multiple depends on how you include the cash flows from Amazon's capitalized leases. In its own presentations, Amazon seems to be encouraging this multiple confusion. As can be seen in Amazon's third slide in its Q2 earning's call web presentation. Amazon's presentation emphasizes its non-GAAP "Free Cash Flow" metric, which excludes most cash flows for capital and financing leases. Amazon's use of cash flow from operations in its Free Cash Flow metric also means Amazon is picking up the positive cash flows associated with its working capital. Over the past four years, Amazon's working capital has contributed $3.6 billion in cash to Amazon's Free Cash Flow metric. The problem with this cash-flow item is the thinking that it belongs to stockholders. It doesn't really belong to stockholders. Technically, it's debt because the majority of working capital cash has been provided through accounts payable growth. Amazon is efficiently using excess working capital for its PP&E investments, but this cash flow is not appropriate for calculating stockholder returns in my view. Slide 3 is a slide you might use to discuss Amazon's ability to borrow money, but it's an inappropriate slide for discussing value with your stockholders, especially without significantly better disclosures around leases. So let's take a look at Amazon's EBITDA and EBITDAR, adjusted for non-cash items and also adjusted for cash rents. From there, let's recalculate the current valuation multiples. We will then adjust the CS model with the cash effects from rents and working capital. As can be seen in Table 3, Amazon's cash flow multiple is dependent upon whether you include rent or don't include rent. "T6A" refers to annualizing the last six months' performance, which upon review was slightly better than the trailing twelve months ending June 30, 2015. These cash flow figures do not include cash flows from Amazon's working capital changes. So now, adjusting for cash rents, how would that change the CS model? To make an assumption for future cash rents attributable to Amazon's capital leases, let's first refer back to Chart 1 and look at the average life on its lease obligations. The short-term nature and CAGR growth in capital lease obligations indicates these are equipment assets like servers for AWS. Amazon has indicated as such in its conference calls. Another point to make regarding Amazon's capital lease obligations is how quickly it must amortize the investments as compared to financing and operating leases. At less than three years, capital leases are creating more term risk for Amazon when compared to the term risk found in Amazon's other leases and the vast majority of Amazon's long-term debt. Short lease terms could result in higher cash rents sooner, should interest rates increase or should Amazon's credit quality decline. To calculate the future rents, an assumption on future investments is required, especially for the AWS segment. Unfortunately, Amazon does not provide future guidance on investments. So the adjustments to the CS model will assume AWS continues its fast growth, which is in keeping with the forecasts in the CS report. Therefore, cash rents will also quickly grow. Here is a quote on the trend from Amazon's 2nd quarter 10-Q filing: "Property and equipment acquired under capital leases were $1.4 billion and $920 million during Q2 2015 and Q2 2014, and $2.3 billion and $1.6 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014. This reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth primarily due to investments in technology infrastructure for AWS. We expect this trend to continue over time." (bold emphasis added) The analysis assumes a 40% CAGR cash rent growth as the sensitized mid-point for the recalculation of the CS model, which is much less than the prior six quarter 67% CAGR for capital lease PP&E and similar to the 44% Q2 2015 over Q1 2015 annualized growth rate. It should also be pointed out that Amazon's lease investments (especially for server investments) will need to be replaced or at least renewed every three years or so. If AWS is going to continue to grow and maintain its existing infrastructure as analysts and stockholders forecast, we need to understand Amazon's PP&E equipment needs in the future for both recurring and new investments. You might think of it in terms of 1/3 of the cumulative past capital expenditures plus inflation will need to be reinvested every year in addition to new investments to support AWS' infrastructure. Exhibit 10 is CS' adjustments to NI to get to "Unlevered Free Cash Flows". Note that CS is including the cash contributions from Amazon's working capital. Table 5 recreates the CS valuation model and then Table 6 recalculates the price target after including cash rents and removing changes in working capital. The results are sensitized around cash rent CAGR growth and Amazon's weighted average cost of capital "WACC". The results are significantly different. One last thought: Let's think about Amazon's "Return on Invested Capital" metric. This is an unusual metric because of Amazon's use of capital leases and the way Amazon computes Free Cash Flow. With growing short-lived recurring capital leases, this metric becomes a little trickier to comprehend. The metric is presented in slide 5 within Amazon's second-quarter slide presentation. Amazon likes to show how the return is growing and is now 17% as of the second quarter 2015. Amazon's Return on Invested Capital is not just a yield. It's a capitalization rate that needs to not only provide a return on capital, but also a return for required recurring investments not reflected in Free Cash Flow like replacing servers financed with capital leases. A lot of pieces make up this metric, including the corresponding assets financed with capital and financing leases. For assets that need to be replaced every three years and financed with capital leases, the capitalization rate for those assets must be greater than 33.3%. Amazon is neither helping the investment community nor itself in the long run unless it improves its lease accounting disclosures and assists the investment community with better understanding its lease financial strategy. Beginning with the third quarter 2015 results, Amazon should provide greater detail behind its lease accounting. On a quarterly basis, Amazon should break out capital and financing leases on its balance sheet. The term "Other Long-Term Liabilities", which includes capital and financing lease obligations, no longer seems fitting. Amazon will be well served if it provides non-GAAP cash rents and reconciles the rents back to GAAP. At the very least, Amazon will improve investor understanding with a breakdown in interest expense between capital and financing leases, long-term debt, and other interest expense. Finally, Amazon should seriously consider providing forward PP&E investment guidance. Capital expenditure guidance for all investments, including capital and financing lease investments, segmented between estimates for recurring and new (EBITDA enhancing) investments will help to improve the investment community's assessment of Amazon's future value prospects, including understanding Amazon's financial strategy for AWS. The disclosures will greatly assist analysts and investors with a better understanding of Amazon's current and future cash flows. Providing better information to the investment community is Amazon's best path forward. Stock valuations based upon confusion and misunderstanding are not in Amazon's best interests.
