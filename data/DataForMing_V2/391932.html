Andrea Urina said she has no other other information at this time. Sheriff's investigators are on scene. The Santa Clara County Fire Department said crews were called to the scene but were then waved off and never went on campus. As BMO adds, deputies were called to the company's corporate headquarters on Wednesday morning after a person was found dead, but only few details were immediately available. Multiple police vehicles could be seen at the campus. Authorities have declined to provide further details, and it is unclear whether the person is an employee of Apple. The cause of death was also not immediately known and is under investigation by the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office. The Apple Campus is the corporate headquarters of Apple Inc., located at 1 Infinite Loop in Cupertino, California, United States. Its design resembles that of a university, with the buildings arranged around green spaces, similar to a suburban business park. Wed, 04/27/2016 - 13:16 | 7483781 Luc X.
