Apple Earnings: Taking A Long-Term View - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. Apple achieved record iPhone sales and total revenue in the December quarter. However, Apple guided to a y/y revenue decline for the March quarter. This will embolden Apple bears and their view of â€œPeak iPhone." Apple's fiscal 2016 Q1 earnings report provided material that both bears and bulls can use to support their respective cases. While I remain bullish in the long term, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) guided for a y/y revenue decline for the March quarter and conceded that iPhone sales also will decline. Bulls will have to look beyond this to the iPhone 7 as well as the Watch, which is gaining sales traction. Apple's growth prospects are good, but they depend on Apple's ability to innovate in new product areas such as automobiles and virtual reality. Apple provided some reassurance for investors by exceeding the total revenue and iPhone units sales for the December quarter. In the table below I summarize Apple's results and provide error calculations for comparison with my predictions. In the conference call on Tuesday, CEO Tim Cook pointed out that the revenue growth would have been about 8% y/y in constant currency. According to Apple, macro conditions including economic slowdowns in key markets as well as foreign exchange headwinds played major roles in Apple's results. Under the circumstances, beating last year's performance is a huge accomplishment, although Apple didn't beat it by quite as much as I would have liked. Since this was widely expected, bearish sentiment has become muted in the past few weeks compared to what it was at mid year. Back in May, Michael Blair had the dubious honor of making the Mac Observer Apple Death Knell Counter (#69) with his article Apple Zenith Behind Us, Nadir On The Horizon . In the article he states A few million units of Apple Watch or a few billion of consumer purchases through Apple Pay will not come close to filling the gap if iPhone volumes drop 20 or 30 million units annually, and that is what I expect to take place in the coming quarters. Since that time, Apple has reported three quarters of financial results, and iPhone sales volumes haven't come anywhere close to Blair's prediction. Even as recently as December, Blair was predicting a "disappointing" Q1 with 65 million in iPhone sales and total revenue of just $68 million. Clearly, Apple bears need to readjust their expectations, but I concede that the guidance for fiscal Q2 will serve to embolden them once again. Apple's revenue guidance of $50-53 billion represents a y/y decline of 9-14% from fiscal 2015's $58 billion. This will certainly afford bears a renewed opportunity to declare "Peak iPhone." As I pointed out in my preview article , this theme was not going to go away in any case. In my preview article, I had thought that Apple's Q1 earnings report would settle the issue of whether the supply chain rumors could serve as reliable indicators of future sales. Unfortunately, I don't think the earnings report really did that. Let's go back to Katy Huberty's (of Morgan Stanley) supply chain data that was reported back in December, which kicked off the "Peak iPhone" theme. At the time, the data indicated supplier cutbacks of 10% for the December quarter and 20% for the March quarter, with the obvious implications for iPhone sales for the respective quarters. But we know there was no decline in iPhone sales for the December quarter and that the expected decline in iPhone sales in fiscal Q2 will be less than 15%, according to Tim Cook during the conference call. Cook's assessment of the iPhone sales decline was given in answer to a question by Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi. So, at least in terms of making quantitative predictions, the supply chain data doesn't appear to be very useful. The lack of quantitative accuracy really calls into question the predictive value of supply chain data. At most, the supply chain data may be an indicator of a gross trend. Or it may be that analysts simply resorted to supply chain rumors to bolster a case for the Q2 revenue decline that could be deduced from other sources. In fiscal 2015 Q2, Apple acknowledges that it was still meeting pent up iPhone demand from Q1. On that basis, as well as macro economic factors, there was a plausible case to be made for a y/y decline in iPhone sales. My personal take on the issue of supply chain data is that the best data comes from major suppliers such as Foxconn and TSMC (NYSE: TSM ) which publish monthly sales figures. In my recent article on TSMC's earnings , I expressed concern about the downturns that both Foxconn and TSMC were seeing toward the end of the December quarter in the form of monthly sales revenue. In retrospect, I should have weighted this data more heavily in my expectations for Apple's fiscal Q2 guidance. There were bright spots besides iPhone and Mac sales for the quarter, specifically in Services and Other Products categories. I was very glad to see Apple provide supplementary information on Services. I get so tired of hearing that Apple is "just a hardware company." Apple announced that it has an installed base of 1 billion active devices for all its various OS platforms - iOS, Mac OS X, tvOS and watchOS. Apple pointed out that this installed base accounted for 84% of its services revenue in fiscal 2015 of $19.9 billion. In fiscal Q1, Apple's Services revenue grew by 15% y/y to $5.5 billion, excluding the Samsung patent infringement settlement. But the direct Services revenue ignores the larger services picture for Apple's products. Every operating system and device Apple makes incorporates a host of free services that Apple users take for granted. These include iCloud drive, iMessage, Facetime and automatic tracking of App Store and iTunes content purchases. Apple monetizes these services through the premium prices of its hardware. Every Apple product basically amounts to OSaaS - Operating System as a Service. The Other Products category exceeded my model estimate of $4.1 billion at $4.351 billion in revenue for the quarter. I believe this indicates that my prediction of about 6 million in Watch sales was just about right. Apple TV is also in this category, so Apple TV sales probably contributed to the surplus. The iPad Problem is Really a Mac Problem Of all the information in the earnings report, the most concerning is iPad sales, which once again came in well below my expectations. Apple clearly needs to do more to address the sales decline than it has. Although I'm personally very impressed with the iPad Pro, it was not enough to even slow down the sales decline. As I explained in my recent article on the impact of the Pro, I think I get where Apple is going with iPad. Eventually, Apple wants to evolve iOS into the principal computing platform that people use rather than PCs. The trouble is, that evolution isn't moving fast enough. In the meantime, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) has jumped out in front with Windows 10 tablets and 2-in-1 convertibles such as its own Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book. As general purpose tablets and productivity tools, they offer much more compelling value propositions than iPad Pro. For the cost of the iPad Pro, a consumer can buy a tablet that runs the full version of Windows 10, uses a more powerful Intel processor, and runs a host of legacy Windows software. Apple's intransigence about not endowing Mac OS X with touch screen capability has gone beyond merely annoying. It's a very real threat to the Mac franchise itself. Yes, I know that the Mac continues to outperform the traditional PC market, according to recent data by IDC and Gartner . The problem is that IDC and Gartner have chosen to exclude Windows tablets from their PC market data. When either of the two companies get around to publishing market data for tablets, I believe we'll find that Windows tablets and 2-in-1s are beating up on iPad pretty badly. The irony of this is that I'm convinced as an iOS developer that endowing Mac OS X with touch would be relatively straightforward. Apple has already introduced numerous features and UI conventions from iOS into Mac OS X in recent years, including full and split screen capability, and an app launcher. Most importantly, Mac OS X with touch would be a far better and more consistent user experience than Windows 10 could ever hope to be. I'm certain of that, because I use Win10 every day. Once again, as with the small screen iPhone, investors are treated to the spectacle of Apple wrapped around the axle of its "not invented here" attitude. Apple needs to get over this once and for all. Touch is becoming ubiquitous, and lack of touch is becoming a crippling deficiency for Mac OS X. The problem for Apple investors right now is that there's really no way to disprove the Peak iPhone/Peak Apple narrative. Even though most analysts are maintaining fairly bullish takes on Apple following the earnings report, buy and overweight ratings are being accompanied by lower price targets. Certainly, Apple's take is that they're just up against a lot of macro head winds that are affecting the industry as a whole. It's reasonable to be skeptical about this, and I'll certainly be looking hard at earnings from competitors such as Microsoft for confirmation, or the lack, for these supposed headwinds. Even if macro headwinds can explain the March quarter guidance, I doubt that things get better for the June quarter in terms of iPhone sales. The June quarter will see a brace of new phones from Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) as well as new phones based on Qualcomm's (NASDAQ: QCOM ) very impressive Snapdragon 820 processor. The intensification of competition in the June quarter will not help iPhone sales in the least. So, for the next couple of quarters, the bearish take on iPhone, and therefore Apple, is going to be very difficult to dispute. The short term (next couple of quarters) could offer significant pain for Apple investors. I've always taken the long-term view of Apple. Apple is dependent on its ability to innovate new products. That doesn't bother me as much as it does some investors who prefer predictable revenue increases. Apple is investing increasingly in R&D as I have long advocated. I expect that R&D will continue to yield innovative, compelling products. Given the short-term outlook, my recommendations for Apple have to be very qualified. Yes, I think it's still a buy, but only for those with a very long, multi-year, investment time frame. In the near term, it doesn't look good as a buy, if only because better buying opportunities will come later in the year. As to what I'm going to do, I'm basically doing what I said I would do in my Positions for 2016 article. I'm holding Apple and looking for opportunities to diversify. I'm confident Apple will recover, but I wouldn't want to predict when that will occur.
