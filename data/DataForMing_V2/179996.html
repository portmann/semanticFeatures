Eros: The Bollywood Netflix - Eros International Plc (NYSE:EROS) | Seeking Alpha Eros has been targeted by Knight Assets. The activist wants the company to focus on its streaming product. Eros International (NYSE: EROS ) is an India-based movie production and distribution company. It was founded by Arjan Lulla in 1973 to export Bollywood films. The key theme in many Indian films is romance, hence the name Eros - Greek god of love. Things really heated up in 2006 when the company raised $150 million to produce movies and to buy movie rights in India. In 2010, it raised another $80 million. Then in 2013, it raised $55 million and listed the company on the New York Stock Exchange. One overhang for the stock has been the complicated corporate structure and dual listings. The Indian business is run via a majority-owned subsidiary that's listed on the Indian stock market. One answer is to de-list the Indian subsidiary and fold it into the parent company. Investors are attracted to the burgeoning Indian market and the massive amount of Internet-hungry youth there. Eros also has a large library of content, with more than 70 releases a year - well above any U.S. rival. Eros has a catalog of some 3,000 movies which gives it a huge head start in the Indian market. Eros accounts for almost 40% of India's box office revenues. Eros has launched ErosNow, an on-demand video service akin to Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ), and has been able to grow that to 26 million users. Netflix has 65 million users. Macquarie Group has said that ErosNow could hit 40 million users in 2016 and 133 million by 2020. The majority of Indian users are not accustomed to paying for content, especially on the Internet. Less than 10% of ErosNow users are paying for subscriptions. There's a lot of potential there. However, Eros also has other ambitions beyond being the Indian Netflix. It's looking to launch its own movie and music channels. The start of this would be a buyout of the mediocre TV network B4U. This scattered focus prompted the London-based Knight Assets to get involved earlier this year. It only owns 2% but has voiced concerns over Eros' strategy. Knight has a $68 a share price target - more than 125% upside. The key here is to get Eros to focus solely on ErosNow, where its streaming service has a first-mover advantage in the video-on-demand market in India. The answer is to build a platform to attract subscribers based on Eros' current library and production capabilities, abandoning its plans to launch movie/music channels. Eros is coming around to the idea of putting all its eggs in the streaming basket in India. It has postponed the launch of its own TV network until 2017, if at all. It also has taken ErosNow off soft launch and is ramping up the marketing. Eros, an India Netflix-Disney (NYSE: DIS ) hybrid, has the potential to tap into a young and growing market in India. Over half of India's population is under 25-years-old. Meanwhile, the Internet penetration in India is just 20%, but the country already has more Internet users than all of the U.S. The world's second most populous country also is building out its wireless infrastructure, which should be an impetus for further ErosNow penetration.
