Apple Stock: Affirming My $140 Target By The End Of May - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha To the weak Apple stockholders - thank you for your shares. The volatility will drive one crazy. But as Warren Buffett once said, "profit from it," which is what I did. " It was dumb to make such a statement after one-day's move." Those were the type of emails and tweets I was subjected to at various parts of the week. And, no, I'm not complaining about it. Keep them coming, in fact. Sure, I put myself in "harm's way" - predicting Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) shares will reach $140 by the end of May. Regardless of the data, I'm not ready to back down from this prediction. Note, I own Apple shares. And, of course, I have an interest in the company meeting my May target. But it never ceases to amaze how quickly hordes of armchair-wannabe Apple experts - who have never seen a tree limb they liked - want to criticize another person's logic. Granted, this week Apple stock didn't react the way I thought it would. Hitting $134 by Wednesday was off the mark. And yes, that the stock hitting $123.36 (low of the week) was a surprise. But let's consider everything that also happened this week, including weakness in the Dow, which was dragged down by losses in various sectors like biotechs, technology, and a few small-cap stocks. Traders (I didn't say investors) also panicked to data suggesting the U.S. trade deficit reached its highest level since 2009. It's a bearish indicator, yes. What does that meant for Apple stock? Absolutely nothing. And, of course, it certainly doesn't help that on Wednesday Fed Chair Janet Yellen made comments suggesting that stock valuations are "quite high." Yellen warned investors of possible dangers, given how high stock valuations were. Unlike her predecessors, Yellen seems more interested in saving retail investors from another market crash, given that the central bank will start hiking rates at some point. But without adding context to "high valuations" she's also keeping retail investors from making money. This sent investors (I didn't say traders) into a frenzy, creating the sort of volatility traders love. And traders capitalized on the weak hands. Apple stock was a casualty, falling Wednesday to $123.36, taking out stop losses at $125, which now appears to be the floor. I added more at $124.13. And to the weak Apple stockholders - thank you for your shares. Thursday, stocks rebounded, driven by easing in bond yields. What does that mean for Apple stock? Absolutely nothing. Sure, it also helped that there were some positive earnings reports from a few tech giants. Still, Apple stock, which began trading ex-dividend on Thursday - paying a 52-cents per share dividend - was down 2.4% for the week at Thursday's close of $125.26. Friday, however, was like Friday of last week. With Apple stock closing Friday at $127.62, marking a strong bounce off the week's low to end the week 3.5% higher. The April jobs report was cheered. It showed what we already know - the U.S. economy is growing. Even better, it's growing at a pace that suggests our "data-dependent Fed" won't raise rates as quickly as some feared. What does that mean for Apple stock? Absolutely nothing. Still, if you're keeping score at home, by then, Apple stock was down for the week (only) 0.61%, when accounting for last Friday's close at $128.41. This means, with my new minted lot at $124.13, I'm up roughly 3%, while taking my cost basis down by around 10%. Sure, $134 by Wednesday didn't happen. But buying at $124.13, or 3.3% lower than last week's close was Christmas. Not to mention, it came just in time for me to capitalize on the 11% dividend increase. In short, as I said last week, Apple is the gift that keeps on giving. While the volatility will drive one crazy, as Warren Buffett once said, "profit from it," which is what I did. And my crystal ball tells me $140 is still on target for May. And what does that mean for Apple stock? Own it, don't trade it.
