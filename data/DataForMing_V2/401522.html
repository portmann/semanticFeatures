Amazon: Can It Really Be Worth $3 Trillion? - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Earlier this week at the Sohn Conference, it was said that Amazon's market cap could reach $3 trillion. That's roughly 10 times the company's current size, making for a tough road ahead if it's to get there. Amazon needs to maintain its sales pace of the last ten years, and also see its valuation stay the same. I don't think it will. Will Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) be worth $3 trillion some day? Maybe, but in the next ten years? It seems doubtful, but that's what Chamath Palihapitiya, CEO of Social Capital, said during the Sohn Conference earlier this week. Currently, Amazon trades with a market cap of roughly $316 billion, a figure that would need to increase ten-fold in the next decade to hit that $3 trillion mark. If anything, the 1,000% gain only seems possible because the stock has already climbed more than 1,800% over the last ten years. Now, I'm obviously not a venture capitalist like Palihapitiya, so his ability to look into the future has far more credibility than mine. I don't disagree with him that Amazon's Web Services business will create "an unbelievable number of losers" when it finally gets to scale. Nor do I doubt the power of Amazon's retail business or its Amazon Prime service. I have Prime, and I love it. "If you believe in the Internet, you have to believe in Amazon. If you believe in buying things, you have to believe in Amazon. If you believe in consumer consumption, you have to own Amazon." Honestly, I don't disagree with any of Palihapitiya's comments - I do believe in all of those things. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has done an incredible job growing the company over the years. The argument over its profitability (or lack thereof) is justified, but shareholders have issued a vote of confidence, letting Bezos reinvest for future growth. He and the shareholders know how much bigger Amazon can still become. Previously, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) was the favorite to reach $1 trillion in market cap. But given its sluggish growth and low valuation, it may not be the first to reach the milestone despite having a $510 billion market cap. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), with its $485 billion market cap, has a shot at being first, too. I don't doubt that any of these companies will eventually hit $1 trillion, or $2 trillion or even $3 trillion, but my biggest issue with the Amazon $3 trillion call is the time frame. Amazon has grown its revenue from 2006 through 2015 at a compound annual growth rate - CAGR for short - of almost 26%. Definitely impressive. If the company maintains that growth rate, sales will climb from $107 billion in 2015, to $1.07 trillion in 2025. Slapping a 3x sales valuation - the current sales multiple on Amazon - on the stock gets its market cap to $3.2 trillion. That won't be any easy ride though. First, Amazon has to continue growing sales at a robust sales rate. With AWS, that's possible for at least the next several years and I don't think anyone doubts the mega-shift happening between traditional retailers and the move to e-commerce. But it's hard to imagine a company growing its revenue by 26% per year at the size that Amazon is. Look at Apple. This is sort of an apples-to-oranges comparison because the two are in different businesses, but the point will be the same. Apple's revenues soared from $19.32 billion in 2006 to roughly $234 billion in 2015, posting a similar CAGR to Amazon at 28.33%. As Apple's revenues soared however, its valuation plummeted, as pointed out in the chart below. So not only does Amazon's revenue growth have to keep the same pace for the next ten years that it has maintained over the previous decade, but the stock also needs to maintain the same valuation. I would say personal electronics has a lower upside than Amazon's business model. But even under that premise, it's hard to see Amazon not hitting a "max out" point somewhere down the line where growth doesn't come so easy. Hypothetically, if its sales did hit $1.07 trillion in 2025, but its PS multiple shrunk from 3x to 2x, the market cap would "only" be about $2.1 trillion. So Amazon's journey to a $3 trillion market cap basically hinges on two outcomes: Either the valuation goes higher while its sales pace slows, or sales continue to grow and the valuation stays constant. It seems like if any company can make it to $3 trillion in ten years, it's Amazon. I personally just don't believe the stock can get there in that little of time. That doesn't mean the stock is a sell or should be avoided. If you love the product and want to own it, go for it. Just be realistic in its upside.
