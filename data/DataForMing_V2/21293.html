Apple: Q2 iPhone Sales Of 55 To 65 Million Foreseen, Then Will Fall Behind Samsung Again - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple should have a very strong Q2 with iPhone sales of 55 to 65 million units. Samsung should sell even more, shipping 90 to 100 million smartphones in the quarter. Samsung momentum is likely to accelerate given strong demand for the new S6 and S6 Edge. By mid year, the scales will tip in favor of Samsung which will reclaim the title of undisputed leader in the smartphone industry. March has come and gone and the latest instalment of the smartphone wars will soon be reporting results. In the last quarter which ended December 31, 2014, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) sold 74.5 million iPhones, drawing parallel to Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) in terms of volume and market share based on the extremely strong demand for its new iPhone 6 models. Wall Street is waiting impatiently for indications of just how much momentum Apple carried into the March quarter and whether Samsung has staged any kind of recovery at all in advance of the launch of its new Galaxy S6 which goes on sale April 10, 2015, too late for the March period. One indicator of demand is interpolation of data from Fiksu.com which provides estimates of the mix of iPhones and Android phones based on internet activity, reporting percentages of each device model in use. For Apple, the quarter looks very strong. By applying the December 31, 2015, Fiksu.com percentages to the 410 million installed base reported by Tomi Anohen , it is possible to estimate the number of iPhones in use by model as at year-end 2014. By assuming retirement of iPhone 5 models at a rate of 500,000 per week and dividing the residual iPhone 5 number by the Fiksu.com March 31, 2015, percentage, I estimated the iPhone installed base at March 31, 2015. Applying the Fiksu.com percentages to that number produced an estimate of the installed base of each model at quarter end and by subtracting I estimated the number of each model added to or retired from the installed base during the quarter. The numbers aren't perfect, of course, but they do suggest a very strong quarter with iPhone shipments of 60 million more or less, a sizable gain over 43.7 million in 2014. Allowing for the crude nature of the analysis, I project Apple will report iPhone shipments of between 55 million and 65 million for the quarter, a number a bit higher than recent estimates I have seen from other sources. Using a somewhat similar methodology, and again using the Fiksu.com percentage data for Samsung Galaxy models and the Tomi Anohen estimates for the Android installed base of smartphones, I estimate Samsung will sell between 90 and 100 million smartphones in the March quarter. While the data are likely to show Apple outstripping Samsung in terms of year-over-year growth, they should also show a resurgence of Samsung versus Apple on a quarter-over-quarter basis. That resurgence will almost certainly accelerate with the expected strong market acceptance of the new Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge. Samsung recently increased its production schedule for the new Galaxy's in response to the enthusiastic market response to their launch announcement. Both Apple and Samsung should thus show year-over-year growth in the March quarter, with Apple's rate of growth beating Samsung's by a wide margin. Even so, with the total March quarter global smartphone market likely to come in around 320 million units (my estimate based on 14% year-over-year growth) market share statistics will return to a more traditional relationship with Samsung taking close to 30% and Apple somewhere around 20%. As the Samsung S6 enters the market in April, I see the iPhone giving way and the share statistics reverting to the mean of the past few years with Samsung holding more than 30% and Apple sinking to the mid-teens. The Samsung S6 is a truly remarkable phone providing leading edge processing power, a world class screen, outstanding camera capabilities, and plenty of internal storage. The 64-bit Exynos Applications Processor outguns Apple's A8 by a wide margin - the screen resolution of 557 ppi compares to the iPhone 6 at 326 ppi and the iPhone 6 Plus at 401 ppi, and the Samsung camera is a hands-down winner in that arena with 16 Megapixels compared to 8 Megapixels on the iPhone and vastly improved software for image processing editing on the new S6; and, Samsung is offering up to 128GB of internal storage with a the base model sporting 32GB compared to 16GB in the base iPhone. Samsung has pulled out the stops to recapture some ground in its war with Apple and I'm betting they will succeed. Early reports disclose heavy demand with sales estimates ratcheting up as the device nears its roll-out. GSM Arena reports that U.S. pre-orders for the S6 are running at double the rate of those for the S5 last year and some forecasts point to sales of 55 million units of the flagship models this year. I am short Apple through puts and will likely add to that short position if Apple's strong Q2 causes AAPL stock price to spike higher.
