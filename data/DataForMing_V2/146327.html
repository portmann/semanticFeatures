Apple: Are iPhone Margins Sustainable? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Verizon’s August 7, 2015, announcement they will no longer subsidize smartphones for new customers is very symbolic and could negatively impact customer upgrade cycles. The Chinese smartphone market’s growth rate is slowing. Founded in 2010, Xiaomi has jumped into China's number one smartphone market share position. Its Mi4 flagship phone sold for $320 vs. $700 for Galaxy S5 and $845 iPhone 6. With U.S. smartphone penetration rates of 77% and iPhone’s 42% U.S. market share, organic revenue growth could be challenging. This article is a high-level thought piece designed to play devil's advocate. I will make a series of bearish arguments against the optimistic Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) bull case. My core arguments are focused on 1) the sustainability of Apple's iPhone margins in the United States after the recent Verizon unbundling announcement, 2) the sustainability of Apple's iPhone unit growth and gross margins in China and 3) offer a different perspective on Apple's valuation. At the outset, I do acknowledge that Apple is arguably the most successful company of the modern era measured by its durable revenue growth, industry-leading gross margins and impressive free cash flow generation. Moreover, sell-side research shop, Canaccord Genuity ( OTCPK:CCORF ), has estimated that Apple earns 92% of industry-wide smartphone handset profits, followed by Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) with the remaining share. Yes, this means that the rest of smartphone manufacturers in the industry are operating at a loss. Given this amazing track record of profitability, at face value, with shares of Apple trading at less than 13X FY15 earnings and less than 12X FY16 earnings, it's understandable that investors could think shares of Apple are undervalued. My aim of this piece is to help investors examine their bullish conviction. Similar to any stock, its future value is based on the trajectory and outcome of future revenue and cash flow performance relative to consensus expectations. 1) After relentless attack ads led by T-Mobile (NYSE: TMUS ) and to a lesser extent Sprint (NYSE: S ), Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) has finally announced that effective August 13th, 2015 , they will no longer subsidize smartphones for new customers. On the surface, Apple bulls could easily shrug this off as insignificant as the No. 1 carrier in the U.S. still allows its existing customers to pay for the cost of a new iPhone through monthly installment payments and there are available options to upgrade early depending on your plan and monthly spend levels. However, symbolically, this is much more bearish as Verizon was the last carrier to finally signal that the days of two-year contracts and subsidized phones are effectively over. This could have negative unit growth and upgrade cycle implications for Apple as the U.S. carriers now collectively have different incentives than Apple. Incidentally, driven by T-Mobile's aggressive campaign accusing Verizon and AT&T Wireless (NYSE: T ) of overcharging for monthly data plans, carriers no longer subsidizing smartphones will impact Apple the most, as Apple rarely discounts and has the highest retail price for its smartphones. In this brave new world, consumers now have an incentive to keep their existing smartphone longer in order to defer the $649-$1,049 upfront cost of purchasing an unlocked iPhone 6 (16GB) at the entry level to a iPhone 6 Plus (128GB) at the high end, or the next generation iPhone which is rumored to be the 6S or iPhone 7 in Q4 2015. Moreover, a few years ago, when smartphone growth rates were higher, Verizon was content to allow customers to purchase the latest iPhone for $200 upfront, as long they agreed to sign a two-year agreement (or renewal). Verizon would then try to recover the full cost of an iPhone by charging more for its data plans and selling higher margin accessories. This model greatly benefited Apple as consumer demand and the U.S. carrier subsidies enhanced Apple's ability to continuously grow iPhone unit volumes and maintain its estimated 50% iPhone gross margins. However, driven by decelerating U.S. smartphone growth rates, as there are currently 187.5 million U.S. smartphone users, which corresponds to 77% penetration, Apple may have difficulty growing in the U.S. Also, stealing market share is challenging as Apple currently enjoys 42% market share. Anecdotally conversations, always dangerous I acknowledge, have revealed that many people that I know got an iPhone because it was only $100 upfront. Moreover, they said they would never pay anything close to $650 for next-generation units out of principle. Enclosed below please find the comScore empirical data. Here's where it becomes problematic for Apple. According to Forbes and the WSJ, in Q4 2014, the average price of an iPhone in the U.S. was $687 vs. $254 for the average Android smartphone. In this new unbundled world, the collective pool of non U.S. smartphone customers (without an iPhone) are now no longer indirectly subsidizing Apple and iPhone users. My point here is that similar to Disney's (NYSE: DIS ) sudden slowdown in ESPN subscribers, customers that are forced into expensive bundles driven partly by expensive ESPN programming/content subscriber charges are simply opting out and canceling cable. Incidentally, this movement has been driven by Verizon's "skinny bundle." To be even more clear, the high cost of the iPhone indirectly forced all U.S. carriers to overcharge for data plans in order for them to recover the $400-$500 in subsidies from iPhone users. Also, despite the option to pay for your phone in monthly installments, psychologically, some cost conscious and more marginally attached smartphone users might chose a mid-tier Android phone for $250-$300 instead of a $700 (or more) iPhone. In the U.S., an unlocked iPhone 6 is $649 (16gb)/$749 (64gb)/$849 (128gb). The iPhone 6 Plus has a starting price that's $100 more, with same price increases for incremental memory. Given the high cost of purchasing an iPhone, it is plausible that consumers will elect a less expensive Android phone option or push out their upgrading time frame. 2) Let's move on to my next argument. I'm not sure that all equity holders of Apple are familiar with Xiaomi and its visionary CEO, Lei Jun, who is called the "Steve Jobs" of China. Xiaomi was founded in 2010. As of 2015, it jumped into China's number one smartphone market share position. As of preliminary Q2 2015 estimates, Xiaomi shipped 15.9% of Chinese smartphones followed by Huawei's 15.7% and Apple at approximately 12.2%. In fairness, Xiaomi's smartphones blended ASP was about $220 USD in Q2 2015 compared with much higher priced iPhones. In the past, there's no question, Apple has done an incredible job of marketing and branding in China, as its 16GB iPhone 6 was priced at $846 USD and its 128GB iPhone 6 plus at $1,245 USD during its October 10, 2014 launch . However, before investors write off Xiaomi's ability to compete with Apple in the flagship premium segment, Xiaomi launched a flagship handset Mi4 in Q3 2014. The Mi4, similar to its other smartphones, runs a special version of Google's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Android software tailored to Xiaomi's ecosystem. Moreover, as this excellent article by Ron Amadeo clearly explains, the Mi4 has impressive hardware specs, is very well designed, and it costs $320 USD ($1,999 yuan). For a comparison, I've read that Samsung's Galaxy S5 initially retailed in China for $700 USD and as I highlighted above, the Apple iPhone 6 started at $845 for the 16GB iPhone 6. As Mr. Amadeo shares in his article, Xiaomi has a different business model than Apple and essentially sells Chinese consumers a well-designed handset for breakeven costs in order to make money in its software ecosystem. Again, in less than four years, Xiaomi has literally leapt from a business plan to China's number one player measured by market share. As a supplement to my high-level China research, I learned the following that reinforces my skeptical stance on Apple's ability to maintain unit growth at its nosebleed Chinese gross margin levels. Source: Texas A&M and Southwestern University of Finance and Economics (pg. 18) January 2013. The exchange rate is 1 U.S. dollar equals 0.16 Chinese Yuan. In 2013, the 75th percentile of Chinese households had $8,927 USD of annual disposable household income. The 90th percentile Chinese household has $17,200 USD of annual disposable household income. The population of China is 1.339 billion and there are an estimated 401 million households. I understand that culturally the iPhone is coveted as a status symbol. However, as a percentage of a household's disposable income, the iPhone looks vulnerable, especially with the threat of Xiaomi's next version flagship device that will be offered at a much lower price if history is any guide. Switching gears, I will concede that it was impressive for Tim Cook to convince China Mobile (NYSE: CHL ) in December 2013 to offer the iPhone on its network in China. China Mobile operates the world's largest network measured by subscribers. I've read that Apple has sold over 50 million iPhones in China since the October 10, 2014, launch. There's no question that Apple's strong performance was the chief reasons its stock had its leg up from $70 to $134 over the past eighteen months. However, measured at 420 million smartphone units in 2014, the overall smartphone market is actual slowing in 2015 and the iPhone 6 has lost momentum in Q2 compared to Q1. Given the high price tag and the economic turmoil in both the physical Chinese economy and Chinese stock markets, I'm skeptical Apple can maintain its gross margins and unit growth trajectory in China . 3) For my last argument: Let's look at some financial valuation and consensus estimates. As I have learned from some buyside mentors, growth stocks are all about understanding consensus estimates. Don't focus as much on the absolute valuation multiple or ratios as they are widely known, readily available and embedded in the current price expectations. As investors, our goal is to understand the fundamental drivers that could materially impact a company's ability to deliver on its consensus estimates. If after thorough investment analysis, an investor arrives at figures materially different than consensus, then you either add or maintain your position or exit to avoid potential losses. In the case of Apple, here are consensus estimates. In FY16, Apple needs to generate $255 billion in revenue and $55.75 billion in earnings. Now, of course, Apple can actually earn less if they continue to buy back more stock through debt issuance (long-term debt now stands at $47.5 billion and net cash is $120 billion). A reminder to readers, Apple's $168 billion in cash is parked overseas. Apple would have to pay a 35% tax bill to Uncle Sam if they repatriated cash back to the U.S. So when calculating an enterprise value for Apple, an investor should consider discounting Apple's cash by 35%. Next let's look at the most recent Q3 2015 earnings release. As I've alluded to throughout this piece, the key to Apple (which is more than 60% of Apple total sales) is the iPhone and its performance in U.S. and China. As we can see from page 25 of Apple's latest 10-Q, the U.S. is Apple's largest market, followed by China. Moreover, China's nine-month ended revenue growth was 81%, which represents over a $20 billion increase. Also, I tip my cap to Apple's incredible 183.1 million iPhone units from Q1-Q3 FY2015 (74.5 million Q1, 61.1 million in Q2, and 47.5 million Q3). That's an incredible high water mark to replicate and surpass. There's no question Apple is a phenomenal company that has built an incredible brand and ecosystem. Through great innovation, branding, design, major economies of scale in its supply chain and vision, Apple has produced amazing financial results. Moreover, it's remarkable how Apple has been able to arbitrage the memory market as it charges much more for incremental memory upgrades relative to its incremental costs. Apple also has gotten away with overcharging for accessories. For example, as an aside, I recently lost my iPhone 6 charger and to buy a replacement it was $40. So instead, I just bought the $20 USB cable without the 12V outlet plug component. Lastly, until now, driven by robust consumer demand, Apple has been able to enjoy amazing pricing power. However, given the decelerating global smartphone growth trends, especially in the U.S. and China, along with the unbundling threats, along with China's no holds barred competition, Apple's iPhone unit volumes and gross margins could be vulnerable. I'm not smart enough or foolish enough to forecast a precise decline rate or timeline, but I fully believe that gravity will set in as Apple's days of escape velocity earnings may be behind them, hence why it trades at 12X consensus FY16 earnings numbers (a multiple significantly lower than the overall S&P 500). Moreover, remember, Apple needs to generate $55 billion in profits to hit consensus estimates. On an absolute basis, this is an incredibly high bar. Good luck Apple longs. I will be patiently waiting and watching from the sidelines as I can't get comfortable owning Apple at its current enterprise value of approximately $564 billion (5.7 billion shares x $120 less $120 billion in net cash).
