Fears Pertaining To Disney Are Over-Exaggerated - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Right now, some investors are concerned that Disney is riskier than the market believes the company to be. Concerns relating to the company's ESPN business are overstressed at this point in time and investors should not be worried about this part of the company. Theme parks are not as capital intensive as some have put forth when you consider that much of capex has been allocated to growth initiatives and they aren't very cyclical. The company's Interactive segment is also doing quite well and will likely continue to do well after being merged back into Consumer Products. In general, I do believe that shares are very pricey and would not be surprised by a decline in price but I don't see the 40%-60% drop that some predict. This past March, I wrote an article discussing The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS ). In it, I highlighted that Disney is a great company and will likely be a good investment for investors with a very long time horizon but that it's not a great prospect for investors who think shorter-term in nature because shares do look pricey. Since then, the company's stock has risen about 6.5% and my thesis remains unchanged about the business but I felt it necessary to revisit it after reading an article by fellow contributor J Mintzmyer who believes Disney's shares have downside ranging between 40% and 60%. Based on his reasoning, I can understand the concerns he put forward and I respect his opinion but I cannot help but to disagree with his outlook for the shares. While there certainly could be some downside to the company's stock sometime over the next year or so, I believe that many of the points made in his piece are faulty in nature and are in need of a thorough refutation. Having said that, I believe that Mr. Mintzmyer's overview of the company's strengths are spot on and I will not rehash those points since he presented them in a manner far exceeding my own ability. For those interested in his piece, I highly recommend reading it. One of the biggest arguments made as to why Disney is a risky prospect boils down to its ESPN operations. As an 80% owner of the network, Disney is the primary beneficiary of this business but also the party that could be harmed the most by a meaningful decline in its sales or profits. According to Wunderlich Securities (Disney does not present ESPN revenue on its own), the network generated sales last year of around $11.2 billion and cash flow of around $4.5 billion. This accounts for nearly 23% of the company's overall revenue and a whopping 46% of operating cash flow. To put it bluntly, ESPN is the very core of Disney. Although ESPN appears to be unassailable, the point made by Mr. Mintzmyer is that the practice of companies offering a la carte programming to customers will significantly harm networks like it. One recent study showed that, in a pure a la carte lineup, ESPN would cost customers $36.30 per month because it would significantly reduce the more than 90 million customers who currently have the program due to the fact that ESPN is provided in most bundles today (effectively spreading the cost out across a larger user base). This is significantly higher than the $6.10 currently being charged for the network today, is greater than any other programs on an a la carte basis, and is far removed from the $1.45 value that customers place, on average, on the network. At first glance, this picture looks really bleak for Disney but there are some important issues to keep in mind. For starters, we are not yet in an a la carte world. Through its Custom TV program (the company's base offering), Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ ) charges $55 per month and provides 45 major channels right off the bat. Customers have the option to pay an extra $10 for each additional packet, such as Sports, Sports Plus, Kids, etc... that each include several channels behind them. For customers who want internet and a phone plan, the cost rises to about $80 per month, which isn't too far from the traditional bundle options so I don't see much incentive to switch over to the pseudo-a la carte offerings that Verizon provides. Even if customers did make this move, nobody would have to pay $36.30 per month for ESPN anyways. You see, the same study also showed that an offering that includes ABC, ESPN and all Disney Channels would cost a more modest $17.79 per month so nobody would pay more for significantly less. Admittedly, this is still more costly than what customers are paying for ESPN today but the evidence points toward a scenario where the savings under more intensive bundling makes a la carte hard to justify. Aside from the disadvantages customers would have to deal with under a pure a la carte system, there's also the fact that really nobody in this space wants to change the status quo besides the service providers. In addition to Disney filing suit against Verizon regarding this change, which they allege to be a breach of contract, other big content providers have stepped up as well. NBCUniversal, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ), and Fox Sports, which is owned by Twenty-First Century Fox (NASDAQ: FOXA ), have both spoken out against Verizon's actions, claiming that the company's move is a violation of their contracts. In fact, the only big player in the sports space that has come out in favor of this move is CBS Sports Network, which is owned by CBS Corp. (NYSE: CBS ). While wars in the entertainment space are fairly common, it's likely that content providers ultimately have more sway in the long run than service providers because of customer loyalty. This is especially true in the case of ESPN, which is synonymous with sports. As the largest player in this space, it's likely that the network's absence from Verizon's packages would create an exodus away from Verizon and toward rival providers who prefer to keep the current system intact. For this reason, combined with the fact that ESPN isn't the only large and profitable part of Disney that generates shareholder value, I believe that the risks provided by Mr. Mintzmyer are overstated. Another weakness put forth by Mr. Mintzmyer relates to Disney's Parks and Resorts segment, which is made up of its theme parks, hotels, cruise ships, islands, etc... The point put across to readers is that this segment is cyclical and capital intensive. While there's some ring of truth to this argument, I believe that these issues are overstressed. Take, for instance, the capital intensiveness of the business. As you can see in the table below , the amount spent on capex for this segment is both volatile and large but there's far more to the situation than meets the eye. *Total values may very slightly due to rounding While capex soared in domestic markets between 2010 and 2011, the trend since then has been, for the most part, down. Between 2010 and 2011, the jump in capex was due, according to management, to increased construction progress payments relating to two new cruise ships, expansions at the company's Disney California Adventure, and the construction of Aulani, a Disney Resort & Spa located in Hawaii. International capex nearly doubled as well, due largely to an expansion project at the company's Hong Kong Disneyland Resort. Since 2011, domestic capex has mostly fallen but still remains over $1 billion due to expansion-related endeavors such as MyMagic+ and Disney's Art of Animation Resort. The area where capex spending has really picked up is on the international stage. Between 2010 and 2014 capex has soared from $0.24 billion to $1.50 billion. This may seem like a concern for investors but this too has been driven largely by expansion efforts. Although there have been many contributors to the rise in capex, one of the biggest has been the construction of the company's Shanghai Disney Resort. Billed at $5.5 billion (43% of which will be paid for by Disney), the project is material in size and requires a great deal of capital in order to complete. According to management, about $1.5 billion alone will be spent on this one project this year. This evidence serves to dispute the point that Disney's Parks and Resorts segment is capital intensive. While the company has been spending a great deal of cash in relation to this segment, much of this spending can be chalked up to growth efforts that are completely voluntary. The real concern would be if maintenance capex were the cause of lackluster free cash flow. Unfortunately, management does not break down maintenance capex in Disney's financial statements but it's probably safe to say that these numbers match up with depreciation and amortization reasonably well. This implies that these expenditures are not a concern for investors but that shareholders should, instead, welcome lower free cash flow if it means continued growth. Now, regarding cyclicality. From what I've seen, Disney's Parks and Resorts segment is largely immune to this phenomenon. In the table below, you can see that revenue for this segment has risen literally every year between 2004 and 2014, nearly doubling over this timeframe. The only exception to this was between 2008 and 2009, when sales dipped 7.2%. Growth quickly resumed, however, rising in 2010 and surpassing 2008's level by the end of 2011. Today, revenue in this segment generates about $15.10 billion per year, up 31.3% from the $11.50 billion seen just as the economic crisis was picking up steam. We can see a similar, though slightly more pronounced, trend when it comes to Parks and Resorts' operating income. Although profits in this segment fell 30.5% between 2008 and 2010, the operating profit margin in 2010 still came in at a respectable 12.3%. This too also picked up speed and stands at $2.66 billion today, 40% higher than 2008's metrics. What's interesting to note, however, is that the slight dip reported on both the top and bottom lines had nothing to do with attendance and had far more to do with Disney's policy of offering attractive discounts. In the table below, you can see that attendance at the company's theme parks has only increased every year since at least 2008 (data does not go back further than that or I would have included it). Even during the worst period of the crisis, attendance rose by 1.1% while rivals like SeaWorld (NYSE: SEAS ) saw a sharp drop in the number of visitors gracing its parks. In 2014, as a result of international growth and rising popularity, attendance at Disney's theme parks stood at a hefty 134.33 million, up 16.6% from 2008. All of this data points to one thing. Although it is certainly true that the segment's revenue and earnings were hit by the financial crisis, the company's brand continued to thrive. Furthermore, it's important to keep in mind that the last financial crisis the world experienced was on an entirely larger scale than any economic event since The Great Depression. In essence, a crash that rocked the world's financial system and permeated throughout society in a way that happens only once or twice every century was only capable of dropping sales by 7.2% and earnings by 30.5% while the number of people spending money to come to the company's parks continued to rise. What's more is the fact that both sales and earnings roared back over the following two years, which indicates that a typical recession would have little to no material impact on this segment. Personally, I have a hard time thinking of such a durable business as being cyclical in nature absent a doomsday-type scenario. Another issue I need to address relates to Disney's Interactive segment. In his article, Mr. Mintzmyer claimed that Interactive has sputtered and that management has been "pathetic when it comes to this segment". This point, in my opinion, has little basis in reality. In the table below, you can see that Interactive has done quite well in recent years. Between 2010 and 2014, revenue has risen 71% from $0.76 billion to $1.30 billion and the only down year was between 2011 and 2012. Furthermore, while the segment's bottom line has been rather volatile, the trend over the past four years has been very encouraging and, last year, Interactive generated an operating profit of $116 million. At first glance, this may not seem all that impressive but when you consider that Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ATVI ), one of the big players in the video game market, has seen both revenue and operating profit fall meaningfully over at least the past three years, I think Disney has been doing pretty good for itself. Year-to-date, the picture for Interactive has been slightly less favorable. Due to maturity in its Disney Infinity product line, some of which has been offset by mobile game growth, revenue has declined during the first two quarters of 2015 from $671 million to $619 million. Operating income has risen during this period from $69 million to $101 million but after you add back restructuring charges this too is down from the $105 million reported last year. In truth, it's never nice to see part of a business experience a downturn but the gaming market, like the movie industry that started Disney on the road it's at today, is extremely volatile and, because of that, I don't think it's appropriate to say that two lackluster quarters makes for a sputtering segment, especially when the general trend has been toward higher sales and profits in recent years. The final point I would like to make is that I honestly believe that shares of Disney may be overvalued but I have a hard time seeing a 40% to 60% decline in share price absent a nasty economic downturn or financial statement fraud. In the graph below, I looked at the price/earnings, price to cash from operations (free cash flow gives a distorted view for a company that is investing heavily in growth), and the price/sales ratios for Disney and I found something interesting. While the company's shares are trading at high multiples in all three categories compared to where the stock has traded over the past 10 years, the overall trading history of the company's shares indicates that Disney's stock isn't in some Goldilocks zone. DIS PE Ratio (Annual) data by YCharts What this implies is that, while a drop in share price could very well happen, it's hard to see shares falling by around half from this point. Would I be surprised to see Disney's stock fall by 10% or 15% sometime over the next year or two? Certainly not! I could even see a drop of 20% as being reasonable during this timeframe if the global economy backslides a bit. Does this mean that I would short its stock though? Heck no! The thought of shorting a market leader with a wide array of strong and growing segments and whose share price is trading at a very lofty, but not outrageous, valuation is terrifying to me since it wouldn't be unthinkable to see shares rise even higher than they already are if matters with the business continue to improve. I respect Mr. Mintzmyer just as I do any other writer on Seeking Alpha. He put all of Disney's strengths into words in ways I probably never could have. He's also clearly passionate about writing and he understands that a great company is not always a great investment. With that in mind, however, I very much disagree with his thesis. I believe that the risks associated with ESPN are minimal, that Parks and Resorts is much better than he thinks it is and that Interactive is faring really well in spite of a two-quarter dip. I do agree with him that shares are expensive but I can't fathom a scenario where shares drop by as much as he expects them to without an economic crisis or case of fraud. For these reasons, combined with the fact that Disney is the big fish in its space, I cannot come to short the stock but I think many readers would agree with me in saying that shares don't appear to be a bargain either.
