The Worst Mistake Apple Investors Can Make Right Now - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. Apple investors seem to be the hardest to please. Whereas other tech stocks with little to no earnings are rewarded with sky-high multiples, Apple is dirt cheap. While Apple faces further downside risk, especially if Apple's first-quarter earnings "disappoint," selling at an 11 P/E is the worst mistake investors can make. It has been a rough go for Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). Despite the company racking up massive growth last year, raising its dividend, and returning billions to shareholders in stock buybacks, shares have consistently fallen since reaching $134 in April last year. For investors, it hasn't made much sense, since the stock is so cheap on a valuation basis. But Apple's dirt-cheap valuation and excellent growth haven't seemed to matter to the market. The steep decline off the highs has me wondering what, if anything, I should do with my shares. I'm tempted to add to my position here, but at the same time, I see the potential for further downside, because buying Apple based on cheapness can be an exercise in frustration. But there's one thing I'm absolutely not doing right now. The worst mistake investors could make is to sell out of fear. Here are the main reasons why I'm holding on through the sell-off and why I may actually add to my position if the stock keeps going down. In March last year, I wrote this article titled "Why It Might Be Time To Take Some Apple Profits," in which I raised what seems to be an inconvenient truth: Apple has become a victim of its own success. The company has grown so large that it seems investors will always doubt how much bigger it can get. Apple is now below $100 as of this writing. With that in mind, my first instinct is to buy more Apple stock. After all, the buy case speaks for itself. Apple generated 28% revenue growth and 43% earnings growth in fiscal 2015 . The company holds $83 billion in cash and short-term marketable securities, and another $164 billion in long-term investments on its balance sheet, with $53 billion in long-term debt. Apple generated $70 billion of free cash flow last fiscal year, and returned $46 billion of it to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. Investors selling at these levels are ignoring Apple's future growth potential at their own peril. Going forward, Apple has far too many growth catalysts to sell the stock at an 11 P/E. It still captures a vast majority of profits in the smartphone industry. Analysts are panicking over reports that Apple is cutting production of the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus due to weak demand. But one possibility that investors don't appear to be considering is that Apple is simply gearing up for the next generation iPhone 7. Another key future growth catalyst that investors appear to be ignoring is Apple Pay, particularly in China. Apple has reached a partnership agreement with UnionPay, which is the main bank card and payment firm in China. UnionPay is a state-owned firm. As such, it controls a monopoly on all yuan payment cards issued and used in China. Apple has announced it will expand Apple Pay into China in 2016, as early as February. E-commerce and digital payments are growing rapidly in China, right alongside the boom in smartphone usage there. By charging small transactions fees, payment platform sponsors can rack up billions in revenue as online transactions are booming in China. Plus, there is the synergistic benefit of Apple's massive ecosystem. Apple's portfolio of products and services are designed to complement each other. Chinese consumers who use and enjoy Apple Pay will be more likely to purchase other products and services from Apple. Lastly, investors should not discount the potential of the App Store. Spending in the App Store topped $20 billion in 2015 and the future potential is even greater. Apple CEO Tim Cook has said that the future of television is apps. The new Apple TV can capitalize on the cord-cutting phenomenon, and one has to think that internet TV and the streaming movement are big positives for the App Store going forward. Plus, there are even bigger "moonshot" ideas that Apple hasn't even announced, such as a potential move into the automotive industry. As a result, because the long-term growth prospects are so compelling, I'm not even thinking about selling here. Risk of further downside in the short-term is nothing compared to the long-term potential. Apple stock is cheap. But as everyone knows, it has been cheap for a long time, and continues to get cheaper. The next major catalyst I'm looking to is Apple's first fiscal quarter earnings report, scheduled for the end of January. In the past five years, Apple has traded for roughly 9.5 times earnings at its trough multiple. That was in 2013. I would not be surprised to see the stock revisit that multiple if the next quarterly report disappoints. The market is notoriously punitive when it comes to Apple earnings, justified or not. That would mean a roughly $88 price for Apple, implying about 10% further downside from here. Therefore, the course I'm taking is to hold and wait until earnings. If the stock continues to fall and gets punished after earnings once again, that's when I'll step in and add to my position. A side benefit to Apple's price decline is that investors can take advantage of its higher dividend, now a 2.1% yield. At $88, the dividend yield would be 2.4%. That would be 20% more than the S&P 500 average yield right now and considering Apple's future dividend growth prospects, that's a strong current yield. If Apple raises its dividend by just 10% per year, in five years the yield on cost will be a very attractive 3.8%. This reflects the benefit of taking advantage of lower stock prices from an income perspective. The one course of action I'm not considering at all, not even remotely, is to sell. To me, that would be the worst mistake Apple shareholders could make, because the long-term catalysts are simply too compelling.
