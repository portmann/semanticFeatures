So How Deep Is That Hole That Boeing Dug For The Dreamliner? - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha I expect deferred costs to reach $30 bn by Q2 2016. Program break-even after 1100 deliveries is achievable. One of the main things that is being eyeballed by investors and analysts is the deferred production cost on the Boeing 787 program. Boeing (NYSE: BA ) uses a clever accounting method that allows the company to pull forward profits. Without the accounting method, Boeing would most probably book high losses in the first few years of Dreamliner production. This method works quite well for projects such as the Boeing 787, but at one point, the deferred costs should start decreasing. For the Boeing 787, this has not happened yet. Break-even on production costs was expected in 2015, after which the deferred costs would start declining somewhere in 2016. At some point, Boeing said it did not expect deferred production costs to rise above $25 bn. In Q2 2015, deferred production costs rose to $27.7 bn, a $790 mln increased compared to last quarter. In this article, I will have a look at how costs per airframe have developed since 2012, and how they might develop in the future. Figure 1: Boeing 787 Deferred costs (Source: AeroAnalysis.net ) Figure 1 shows quite well that deferred costs rose sharply since Q1 2012, but at the same time, it can be seen that from Q3-Q4 2013 and onwards, the rate of costs growth started declining. This can be seen as a first step on reaching break-even on production. The decelerated cost growth is better visualized in Figure 2: Figure 2: Boeing 787 quarterly increase in deferred costs (Source: AeroAnalysis) As can be seen in Figure 2, deferred costs per quarter started declining since Q1 2014. Compared to Q1 2015, the growth rate of deferred costs was stable, but the increase in deferred costs does not take into account the number of deliveries. Figure 3: Loss per produced Boeing 787 (Source: AeroAnalysis) Figure 3 gives a clear view on the development of deferred production cost per unit. It can clearly be seen that the costs have been declining and currently are around $23 mln. So in Q2, Boeing lost $23 million per produced Boeing 787, which is a 12% improvement compared to the previous quarter and a 40% improvement year over year. In order to break-even by the end of the year, Boeing needs to cut costs per unit by 50% or 55% in total costs in the next quarter and completely cut costs in the fourth quarter. Given Boeing's progress in cutting costs, I don't see this happening. During the last quarter, Boeing decreased the growth rate of costs by 170 mln per half year, which is equivalent to 10% per quarter. Using a 10% reduction in growth rate per quarter, deferred costs will grow to $29.9 bn in Q2 2016 and hit break-even around that same time. If Boeing further invests in the production process break-even might even occur earlier than Q2 2016, but reaching break-even by the end of the year really is a challenge. By Q2 2016, Boeing will have delivered approximately 450 airframes and has accumulated almost $30 bn in deferred costs. If Boeing needs to break even on the program with its current backlog, it needs to make $46.5 mln profit per airframe. As increasing profitability per airframe is a gradual process, profit per airframe needs to be slightly higher to compensate for lower profit on the first few profitable airframes. The Boeing 777-300ER currently (at high discounts) has a profit margin of 23%, but this used to be as high as 40%. A 40% profit margin on the Boeing 787 would mean a $53 mln profit per aircraft (whereas $46.5 mln is needed to break-even). This indicates that breaking even on the program with the current backlog does make sense. According to my calculations Boeing could return profits on the entire program within the first 1100 deliveries, which is a figure that Boeing already estimated 4 years ago and are now being confirmed by my own calculations. With demand for medium and small widebody aircraft topping 8000 airframes in the coming years, the future looks bright for the Dreamliner. Reaching break-even by year-end without investing in the production process is a major challenge Using a 10% reduction in growth rate for the deferred costs, I expect break-even somewhere after 450 deliveries and a deferred production cost close to $30 bn Boeing could see profit on the program within 1,100 deliveries The hole that Boeing dug for the Dreamliner is deep, but increases in efficiency, production rates and strong demand should give the Dreamliner strength to fly out of that hole.
