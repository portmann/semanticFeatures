Jony Ive Was Demoted, Not Promoted, And Other Things Apple - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Jony Ive was formally promoted within Apple. However, there are several signs which indicate this was not really a promotion, at least regarding his power to influence the iPhone and Apple in general. Now, this might be controversial, but I believe Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Jony Ive was just demoted when he was "promoted" to Chief Design Officer (CDO). I will explain why I say this. Formally, Jomny Ive was previously Senior Vice President of Design and saw its responsibilities expanded to include software UI design. At that point, Jony Ive controlled both the hardware and software design of the iPhone. However, Jony Ive's position within the company has long exceeded its formal position. Steve Jobs is quoted by Walter Isaacson (in his Steve Jobs biography) as having told him that Jony Ive: "has more operational power than anyone else at Apple except me." This effectively made Jony Ive the second in command within Apple. Something also confirmed by Steve Jobs branding him "his spiritual partner at Apple." As we've seen, formally Jony Ive was promoted, and he does retain control over the two areas which he already controlled. However: This control is now indirect, through Richard Howarth for hardware design and Alan Dye for UI design. In becoming a C-level executive, Jony Ive actually becomes the third most important executive, after the CEO and CFO. Third is a lower position than second. In the article which first disclosed the promotion , by Jony Ive's friend Stephen Fry, Jony Ive said he'd be traveling more, which is not exactly consistent with a massive focus on the next product iterations, especially the next iPhone iterations. Indeed, in the past avoiding such travel was an Apple priority to concentrate on the product design. So one can say Jony Ive is distancing itself at least from concrete present product design. Furthermore, in that same article Jony Ive is said to be concentrating more on store design work and the new HQ design work. Both are, for the most part, highly irrelevant for Apple's ultimate success - which at this point rests solely on the success of the iPhone. The whole thing basically points to Jony Ive losing power within Apple to influence its near-term destiny. This destiny is tied to the iPhone, and Jony Ive with all the changes is likely to have much less input into such design. Jony Ive could conceivably have more impact on the design of the future Apple car. First, the new position will free him from administrative processes and allow him to concentrate on more diverse and newer projects. This could include the Apple car. And second, there's a slight clue pointing in this direction in a recent New Yorker article titled " The Shape Of Things To Come ." I quote: He and Newson are car guys, and they feel disappointed with most modern cars; each summer, they attend the Goodwood Festival of Speed, where vintage sports cars are exhibited and raced in the South of England. "There are some shocking cars on the road," Ive said. "One person's car is another person's scenery." To his right was a silver sedan with a jutting lower lip. Ive said, quietly, "For example." As the disgraced car fell behind, I asked Ive to critique its design: "It is baffling, isn't it? It's just nothing, isn't it? It's just insipid." He declined to name the model, muttering, "I don't know, I don't want to offend." (Toyota Echo.) This article, out on February 23, 2015, seems very relevant because it eerily predicted many of the things happening now, which is fitting for the title it carried. For instance: Jony Ive described himself as "deeply, deeply tired." Hence consistent with a position less connected to the ongoing pressure to produce iteration after iteration of existing products. The article quotes Laurene Powell Jobs as saying that "artists aren't to be responsible for this kind of thing" when referring to Jony Ive and the pressure for Apple to deliver to Apple shareholders - something deeply connected to the next iPhone. This could have foreshadowed Jony Ive's present "distancing" of management responsibilities and, quite possibly, the iPhone. Jony Ive's "ownership" of the Apple Watch, though when the article was written the Apple Watch, was being publicly presented by Tim Cook. So this move could also point toward Jony Ive having more of an involvement with the Apple car's design. And Jony Ive might even be part of the reason the Apple car project exists to begin with, though Steve Jobs was also fond of trying to build one. Another possible reason why Jony Ive might have felt the pressure to step aside somewhat from Apple's core products might be the performance of the Apple Watch. While initial numbers seemed ok, with never-confirmed millions (2-2.5 millions) in initial orders, the recent pace of orders seems to have slowed down to a crawl. Digitaltrends.com now puts the order pace at just 30,000 per day, which is consistent with a 11 million pace for an entire year. 11 million Apple Watches is well below the stratospheric expectations which existed when I penned my article titled " A Watch Cannot Move The Needle Much ," where those expectations stood as high as 50 million units per year. Indeed at this point even the recent much-lowered expectations are being slashed, with KGI securities now estimating the market at just 15 million units sold in the first year. This "failure" might have led Jony Ive to finally decide to step away from the need to produce winner after winner, consistently with what Laurene Powell Jobs said. Or it could have led to a level of internal power struggle which Jony Ive is probably ill-suited or uninterested to fight. Each transition of an important figure in Apple's past represents a large risk. When Steve Jobs died Apple managed to avoid losing its balance, even though he was the most important figure Apple ever had. Now Jony Ive seems to be distancing itself from Apple's largest moneymaker, the iPhone. This, too, will present a large risk for Apple in the sense that Apple will do as the iPhone does. Apple should have a competent bench of replacements, including the two executives which will handle hardware and software UI directly, but changes are still a risk. Apple has to win every year with every iPhone iteration. The iPhone represents two-thirds of Apple's revenues and more than four-fifths of its profits. If a single iPhone iteration fails, Apple stock cannot be spared a significant beating. Moreover, the latest iPhone (the iPhone 6) had tremendous pent-up demand for the larger display. The next 2 iPhones, the 6S and 7, will thus be facing a much harder mission. In the iPhone 6S, the central feature, force touch, is unlikely to make any difference for consumers. A speedier SoC is likely but improvements at this point are now rather marginal. The camera also is likely to be better and to finally include an higher MP count, and this will probably take the center stage from the force touch. But it, alone, also is unlikely to move the market. The problem repeats itself with the iPhone 7. Indeed, it will probably be even worse. The iPhone 6S can still count on a legion of iPhone 5S replacements, so will still have a measure of benefit from the larger display. The iPhone 7 won't have such luxury. Between the Apple Watch "failure" (I say this between double quotes because this "failure" is just versus expectations, any other company would cry to have one such "failure") and the absolute need for the iPhone 6S and 7 to be winners, Jony Ive might have decided to step a bit aside. He might have decided to dedicate himself to newer, more interesting and less risky subjects. Like the Apple car. The Apple car is distant in the future and has little likelihood (at this point) of supplanting the iPhone's importance. But for a designer, especially a car-loving designer, it must be 1,000 times more interesting. Far from being a promotion, the Jony Ive ascendancy to CDO seems like an early retirement from the responsibilities of dealing directly with Apple's bread winners. It also seems like an effective loss of managerial power. But for Jony Ive personally, the change is likely for the better. Jony Ive will probably be more involved with projects that are longer-term in nature, like the Apple car, and less involved with projects which are critical to Apple's value today - like the iPhone.
