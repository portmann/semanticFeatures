Apple Watch Pre-Order Sellout: Have The Pundits Underestimated Apple Again? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple Watch effectively sold out after the first two hours of on line pre-orders. This indicates a high level of interest that is more typical of a new iPhone. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) began accepting pre-orders for the Watch at 12:00 AM pacific time Friday, and in about 2 hours, all but one model of the Watch was backordered 4 weeks or more. The rapid sell out of the Watch on the Apple Store site was witnessed by this writer first hand. Some of the more exclusive Watch Editions were listed as shipping in August. Have the technology pundits underestimated demand for Apple Watch? Probably. Initial reviews for the Watch have been mixed. Probably the best, and very representative review I've seen is Nilay Patel's of The Verge. Generally, the reviews recognize that Watch is a technical tour de force, but repeat the same question: Is it necessary? And all reviews point out the various shortcomings of the Watch: it can be slow, it seems to try to do too much, it lacks focus . . . The question of necessity is a red herring, an intellectual trap that reviewers frequently fall into when confronted with a new Apple product. Innovation often seems unnecessary at conception. To many accustomed to working with computer keyboards, the mouse seemed unnecessary when Apple first introduced it. The reviewers and pundits are asking the wrong question. The right question for the Watch is whether it's useful. If people find it useful, it will become necessary. Now that we've heard from the pundits, it's the consumers' turn to speak with their purchase choices. When on line pre-orders for the Watch sold out in a mere two hours, Apple's customers sent a loud and clear message. For them, the Watch is the new essential personal tech. I know many will question my assertion, and my technical judgment. I could be jumping the gun. I could be wrong. For this reason, I formulated the article title as a question. So let me try to formulate the pros and cons for Apple Watch. The Value Proposition: when you consider all the things that Apple watch does with reasonable or exceptional proficiency, the Watch is a bargain among smart watches or even luxury sport watches from the likes of Tag Heuer (part of LVMH). Here, I'm not even talking about all the things for which the Watch depends on iPhone, I'm talking about the things it can do on its own: provide accurate time keeping that automatically adjusts for time zone and daylight savings time; heart rate monitoring and fitness tracking; music playback; Apple Pay (after being paired with an iPhone, it can work independently). The Watch tries to do too much and is too complicated: There does seem to be some learning curve that reviewers have reported. iPhone users will probably adapt very quickly to the Watch interface. The Watch engages in notification overload: This does seem to be a problem, but it's one that can be overcome with future software updates. The initial setup might also be misguided, with all app notifications defaulting to on. The Watch is slow: Since this is a first generation product, the software is very much a work in progress. Future updates will probably cure most of the delays that reviewers are seeing. Beyond that, Apple probably will build future generation Watch processors using the most advanced process now available, Samsung's ( OTC:SSNLF ) 14 nm FinFET process, which so far is only available in Samsung's own Galaxy S6. This will help speed things up in the Watch, as well as extend battery life. The Watch has only limited water resistance: This was my complaint after the Watch event in March. I still consider this a disadvantage, which I hope will be corrected in future generations. When I think about the pros and cons of Apple Watch, it seems to me that the cons are mostly about execution. No one is really questioning whether the Watch is useful. And as Patel points out, Apple Pay works really well, and is a great example of Apple integrating hardware, software, and services into a great user experience. Based on the rapid sell out of pre-orders, I do believe that most of the media have underestimated demand for the Watch, although I certainly can't prove this at the moment. It appears that Angela Ahrendts' statement that "demand will exceed our supply at launch" was more than just PR. Of course, in many cases, supply was very limited or non-existent. Many models were unavailable from the start, especially the smaller size of Watch with the "Modern Buckle" wrist straps. I'll admit that the limited availability makes it hard to make an objective case for extensive Watch demand. Apple will probably announce first weekend pre-orders for Watch next week, and at that point, we'll have a better idea of the extent of demand. However, Apple has been working on the Watch for quite a while, so I expect that Apple had time to build up several million units in inventory. If this is the case, selling out this inventory in a matter of a couple of hours certainly indicates strong demand. As of my article on the Watch event , I had estimated sales of about 10 million units/quarter average over the next three quarters of 2015, or about 30 million units for the calendar year. I think demand could easily exceed this number, so the question is whether Apple can ramp up production in the summer in order to meet customer demand going into the December quarter. Apple has a strong history of being able to do this, so I believe that Apple could ramp up production to meet a demand as high as 20 million units in the December quarter. So now my estimate has become a range of 30-40 million units this calendar year with an ASP of $650 and a 50% gross margin, this yields a gross profit of $9.75-$13 billion in calendar 2015 from Apple Watch. Not bad at all for an all-new device. It may be that we've all been too focused on the near term bottom line impact of Watch to get the big picture. The significance of the Watch may be in the way it positions Apple for future technology advances. With increasing functionality being put into ever smaller and more energy efficient electronic circuits, it's conceivable that the wrist device will become our primary communications device. Within a generation or two, Apple Watch might be able to make video calls over cellular networks. The main limitation at the moment is the size of the battery that would be required for this. Improvements in battery technology, as well as electronic circuits, would be necessary, but Apple is hard at work in these key areas. The current Apple watch is now known to have some standalone WiFi capability , and this may be expanded in future software updates. Future generations of the Watch will probably become increasingly independent of iPhone, supporting audio calls and messaging over WiFi first and eventually over cellular.
