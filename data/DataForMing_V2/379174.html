Don't Buy And Hold Amazon - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha We looked into the seasonality of Amazon and found some interesting and hugely profitable investment strategies. At first appearance, February seems to be Amazon's underperforming month. After pointing out that last week was the time to buy Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) (and being right so far to the tune of 7%), I received the following message: The request for "the same analysis" on Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) is one where we look for a strategy superior to buy and hold for this company's stock. Interestingly enough, Seeking Alpha contributor Dana Blankenhorn argued you should buy and hold AMZN on Wednesday. While he got the fundamentals right - cloud is the future of Amazon, just as it is for Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) - he didn't justify the "buy and hold" part. In Dana's defense, the article is more of a long thesis than a reasoning for buy and hold. So let's ask the question: Should we buy and hold? Is buy and hold really the best strategy for AMZN investors? Or does AMZN, like Facebook, have seasonality you can leverage for extra gains? Let's start by looking at AMZN's performance over the past 19 years - segmenting the stock by monthly performance. The retail sector is a seasonal one, so we should suspect Amazon to be seasonal as well. We find a couple of interesting patterns: AMZN seems to have the pattern of underperforming in February. In addition, its best months tend to be March and April, much like the best months for Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT ). February has witnessed drawdowns close to 50%, whereas March and April show the lowest max drawdowns: 5% and 20% respectively. The months of March, September and November seem to be the safest, with over 70% of those months showing positive returns. September and November have the best average returns, giving 10% and 9%, respectively, on average. These monthly patterns give us the first possible strategy for an alternative to buy and hold. Perhaps we should ensure we hold AMZN during March, April, September and November. But as I've found in the past, much of these seasonal patterns relate to earnings. So, let's take a look at how AMZN responds to the company's earnings. A quick look at AMZN's earnings reports show EPS tends to spike the most during Q4: In addition, the most recent earnings report shows Amazon is back on the offensive. Previously, Amazon was in a negative EPS rut. Amazon seems to have shaken off this rut in the last fiscal quarter, pointing to an increasingly bullish AMZN. We should note that the last earnings report was received negatively, dropping the stock 7%. This was merely due to a failure to meet estimates, not a failure in the fundamentals of the company. We can deal with this in more depth in a future Exposing Earnings newsletter . But for now, note that Amazon is likely back on the offensive. Therefore, any long strategy that exceeds buy and hold should work moving forward. The question is whether such a strategy exists. Dropping one month per year from our AMZN position cuts our gains in half. Cool, right? No. Even when we hold AMZN during the two safest months per year, we lose a disproportionate amount of gains. Still, this strategy beats the SPY, so it's not bad for an investor with a risk-aversion tendency who still wants some exposure to AMZN. This strategy is simply the previous strategy with the addition of holding through December. Again we beat the SPY and see a more extreme risk/reward profile. Holding the month surrounding Q4 earnings If you're looking for a way to lose money by holding onto AMZN, you've found it. Holding the stock to capture Q4 earnings is a losing strategy. In fact, it's probably a great short strategy on this otherwise iron-plated stock. This gives way to another possible strategy: avoiding the month of Q4 earnings: â€¦ and there it is: the holy grail of AMZN investing. By avoiding the month around the Q4 earnings release, you gain 300% the yield of buy-and-hold, which more than makes up for the potential tax losses in selling one month per year. Why does AMZN struggle so much during Q4 earnings releases? As we saw from the last earnings release, it is likely a result of overly optimistic analysts. In Exposing Earnings, I frequently mention that most analyst estimates are consistently biased; you should ignore EPS and revenue estimates in most cases. Let's do one more thing before concluding. Let's take a look at a trading strategy for a more daring investor: Short AMZN around Q4 earnings; long AMZN otherwise: What you're looking at above is a 100% exposure strategy that brings 400% more profits than buy and hold. But it's not for the faint of heart, as the short position puts you at a theoretically unlimited list. I recommend the following instead: Now your AMZN gains are not subject to income taxes and you still gain the upside from the short position. Happy trading.
