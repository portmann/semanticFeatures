Skyworks: All Aboard - Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) | Seeking Alpha With broader market fears subsiding, Skyworks has been free to push higher. Since my claim that the stock is too undervalued to ignore, shares have established substantial upward momentum. Finally! Skyworks (NASDAQ: SWKS ) has been getting a major boost lately due to broader market pressures subsiding and the S&P 500 breaking out. In my last article on SWKS titled "Skyworks Is Too Undervalued To Ignore," I claimed that the stock was a major bargain at its price level and that investors might be wise to buy in at the bottom. That article can be found here . SWKS sat at $58.93 when I wrote that piece, and as I check quotes during Thursday's trading session, shares are now trading at $67.50, a gain of close to 15% in just 5 trading days. This has been welcome news to SWKS investors, myself included, who have watched shares languish despite strong fundamentals. The stock's recent struggles can be traced primarily to two sources: Apple association and Brexit. As I mentioned in my previous article, two days of Brexit mayhem knocked SWKS down 15%. Then the post-Brexit rally began and shares look poised to join in, but a downgrade from analyst firm Pacific Crest citing lower prospects for the iPhone again gave SWKS a beatdown. Yet here we are now with the stock back to its pre-Brexit price. The S&P 500 (NYSEARCA: SPY ) is up 3% over the same span as SWKS has gained 15%, which may explain some of the upward momentum, but this has been a long time coming in my opinion. Shares have consistently shown signs of moving higher before a some news release comes out that might have negative connotations for the company knocks it down a few pegs. That reactionary attitude is not likely to change anytime soon. And it just so happens that, like other SWKS rallies, this rally might be in danger of getting cut short by downbeat news as well. As I have established in my previous discussion of Skyworks, the degree with which SWKS moves with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) stock is outdated and does not accurately reflect the former's revenue diversification. Nevertheless, opining on the way things should be and ignoring the way things are is not a successful investing strategy. It is for this reason that I will be taking steps to protect my substantial (relatively) long position in SWKS before the upcoming earnings reports of both Skyworks and Apple. Skyworks reports Q3 results on July 21st (next Thursday) and Apple reports on July 26th (two Tuesdays from now). Despite my personal opinion that the markets unfairly treat both Apple and Skyworks individually, and assign inaccurate weight to Skyworks' relationship with Apple, I will likely buy put options on SWKS before Skyworks reports earnings. The iPhone worries that hurt SWKS after the company's Q2 report are very likely to weigh on Q3 results as well. And once the market catches any wind of negative iPhone news, both SWKS and AAPL are likely to be sent plummeting down. I think Skyworks' Apple-derived revenue will stabilize after the release of the iPhone 7, but the company must endure another few months before the release of the smartphone. I find it hard to imagine that the current iPhone generation has seen any recovery since the dismal results of last quarter, and because of both the reality of Apple association and the negative effect iPhone struggles will have on Skyworks' top line, I feel put options are an appropriate move for long investors. Depending on how the put options on Skyworks' earnings play out, I will consider what moves to make regarding hedging against potentially negative results from Apple. Long-term, my position on SWKS has not changed: I think the company has outstanding future growth potential and has the potential to generate a high return for investors. If the put options do net a profit, I will likely use the proceeds to pick up more SWKS shares at the depressed price.
