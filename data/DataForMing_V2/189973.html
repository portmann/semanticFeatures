Apple: Unbundling To Drive Ecosystem Penetration - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha The introduction of Apple Music for Android is an unbundling move necessary to drive AAPL's service penetration higher. Investors can expect additional unbundling of the company's services in iTunes, Movies, iBooks, and particularly Apple Pay, as AAPL looks to drive non-iPhone sales. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) announced that its Apple Music, iTunes Movies and iBooks will be available to customers in China. While the media was focused on AAPL's pricing, I believe that the bigger implications are 1) the unbundling of its services, which is an inevitable move to drive non-iPhone sales when the company is faced with a maturing smartphone market, and 2) AAPL Music, iBooks and iTunes Movies may not be as successful as the iPhone given that Chinese consumers are already accustomed to the existing media applications from Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ), Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU ) and Tencent ( OTCPK:TCEHY ). To be clear, my bearish thesis on AAPL lies in a flattening innovation curve of the iPhone and the contracting ecosystem as Android devices move up the value chain (see Apple: The Party Is Over - Initiating With A Bearish View ). China is one place where AAPL will see challenges on both the hardware and the ecosystem (i.e. services) given that Chinese handset OEMs are increasingly putting out premium handsets that rival the iPhone and service integrations tailored to the Chinese market. In short, I do not believe AAPL can count China for its future growth. I remain bearish on AAPL and bullish on the Chinese incumbents BABA and Tencent. Faced with a maturing handset market and the fact that the iPhone will not see mass adoption, it makes sense for AAPL to unbundle its services from the hardware to drive higher penetration of its ecosystem and increase its non-iPhone revenues. AAPL's roll out of Music, iTunes Movies and iBooks is a clear example of this move, particularly with Apple Music, which will be available for Android. This is designed to drive penetration of AAPL's services in non-iPhone devices, adding to the growth of the AAPL ecosystem. Ultimately, I see Apple unbundling other services such as iTunes, Movies and payments to drive adoption of its services. I note that AAPL's decision to make iTunes mainstream planted the seed for the adoption of its ecosystem well before the launch of the first iPhone. The mass commercialization of Apple Music is the second catalyst for this trend, and we can certainly see the unbundling trend to flow to iBooks, Movies and payment. Mass commercialization of Apple Pay will be particularly necessary given that AAPL is competing against BABA and Tencent that dominate 90% of China's mobile payment market (see - Apple: Will China Be A Game-Changer For Apple Pay? ). In essence, AAPL could introduce an Apple Pay app for Android to drive payment penetration in non-iPhone devices. The integration of merchant services such as movie/entertainment, food delivery, travel booking and so forth is a logical step given how advanced BABA's Alipay has become (see - Alibaba: Setting An Example In Mobile Payments ). To be clear, Apple Music, iTunes and iBooks do not differentiate AAPL form those offered by its rivals, but rather a way to drive incremental penetration of the services when AAPL is faced with significant competitive pressure from incumbents. I note that Apple Music competes head on with music services from BABA, BIDU and Tencent that offer both streaming and free download options. While AAPL may have more foreign artists than local providers, the fan base for those artists is still relatively small, so it's unlikely to have a meaningful impact on AAPL's top line. As for iTunes Movies, AAPL will be faced with incumbents like Youku (NYSE: YOKU ) that have aggressively ramped up their catalogs. LeTV, Wasu Media, BesTV, BaoFeng Tech and Xiaomi, to name a few, offer both domestic and foreign movies. Additionally, IP protection on newer titles is still weak in China, so pirated movies are commonplace, and this will be a challenge for paid movies to gain any traction in China. Finally, as for iBooks, the digital book space is dominated by Dangdang (NYSE: DANG ) as well as other vendors that sell both eReaders and digital book packages, so AAPL will certainly lack differentiation on this area. Finally, AAPL's investors should ask themselves whether the company will have any pricing power against rivals that offer comparable products. Apple Music is priced at $1.57 in China vs. $9.99 in the US while movies start less than $1, with HD costing around $3. I believe the low pricing is driven by a combination of lower GDP/capita and an undifferentiated service offering, resulting in the commoditization of AAPL's services. With the Chinese smartphone OEMs gradually moving up to the premium segment and offering their own unique ecosystem, the iPhone increasingly loses its differentiation, so I believe Apple's long-term pricing power in the iPhone is unsustainable. While this may not happen in the medium term, commoditization of the premium smartphone could be a key headwind for AAPL in ten years out, which is perhaps why AAPL is focused on driving non-iPhone revenue and services in a way to offset the declining profitability of the iPhone (see - Apple: The Challenged Ecosystem ). In conclusion, I remain bearish on AAPL and the future growth of its services in China. I simply do not see how the company can compete against or differentiate from BABA, Tencent and BIDU. My preference among the BAT trio remains BABA, followed by Tencent. BIDU is my short pick due to an uncertain near-term outlook.
