ETF Hub Jan 14 2016, 12:34 ET | By: Carl Surran , SA News Editor United Airlines ( UAL -1.3%) is close to deciding on an order for ~30 small jets worth ~$2B at list prices, and Boeing ( BA +1%) looks well placed to win at least part of the deal after undercutting smaller rivals, Reuters reports, citing industry sources. A decision in favor of Boeing's 737-700 jet would be a blow for Canada's Bombardier ( OTCQX:BDRAF , OTCQX:BDRBF ), which has courted UAL as a key prospect for its struggling CSeries jets, as well as for Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSF , OTCPK:EADSY ) and Embraer (NYSE: ERJ ). United's requirement for 100-seat aircraft is a natural fit for all the manufacturers, but Boeing reportedly moved in with highly competitive offers for its slightly larger 737-700, which officially seats 126 passengers, according to the report. The smart play would be to invest in A319/318 family. It is reliable, efficient and more affordable than the 737-700. Airbus would also likely cut a deal if the discussions included the 321neo- the only a/c that can replace Ual's aging fleet of 757 a/c.
