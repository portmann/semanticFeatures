ETF Hub Jul 22 2015, 02:43 ET | About: Facebook (FB) | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor Boosted by a recent stock surge, Facebook's (NASDAQ: FB ) market capitalization has overtaken that of General Electric. Some are expressing concerns. GE racked up $149B in sales last year and employed more than 300,000 people. Facebook reported $12.5B in sales and employed roughly 9,200. First post on SA - Correct me if I'm wrong but is generating 12.5b in sales with 9,200 workers not better than 149b with 300,000 workers ??? It depends. If you think Facebook is going to grow bigger than GE over the next few years then it's probably worth the premium. Facebook is sitting on a near monopoly which can potentially lead to outsized returns. The market is just over valued social media based on potential. The difference between GE and FB is that GE makes 12 times more sale and profit that FB still market rewards FB and not GE. Same is the case with Apple that makes more than GE and price per share is still so low; that it is a crime if you don't buy Apple Facebook had operating earnings of $4.99 billion on $12.46 billion in revenues in 2014 while GE had operating earnings of $26.7 billion on $148.6 billion in revenue. Any questions left? "GE racked up $149B in sales last year and employed more than 300,000 people. Facebook reported $12.5B in sales and employed roughly 9,200" This is indicator of the huge potential of social media as well as the entire Internet industry.
