Then, like all commercial fads, this pitchman’s familiar face faded from public view… only to be dusted off and trotted out as a shill for Sprint. Sprint kicked off a new campaign over the weekend featuring Paul Marcarelli, the guy who appeared in just about every Verizon ad for nearly a decade until 2011, asking viewers if they could hear him now. But is bringing Marcarelli, who Sprint claims is now a customer of the provider, over to the yellow-side just Sprint picking up Verizonâ€™s sloppy-seconds? Not according to the fourth-place wireless company, which says that by scoring Marcarelliâ€™s endorsement they have â€œdemonstrated that its fastest and most reliable network ever can lure away even the most iconic people in wireless.â€? By using the actor Sprint is attempting to call attention to its â€œvastly improved network and to highlight the savingsâ€? the provider offers. Marcarelliâ€™s appearance in the new commercials look strikingly similar to that of his old home: dark-rimmed classes, blue jacket. The only real difference is heâ€™s swapped out his red shirt for a yellow one. Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure says in a statement that the company has made â€œtremendousâ€? advancements in its network, burning its reliability within 1% of Verizonâ€™s. However, that stat isnâ€™t what the new pitchman is selling. Instead, his spots – and Claureâ€™s sentiments â€” focus on the companyâ€™s claim it can save users up to 50% off their bills from other national carriers. Of course, it’s these 50% off claims that recently landed Sprint in tepid water with an ad industry watchdog Â for not exactly being 100% transparent about exactly how much people would save. Not one to sit on the sidelines, Verizon doesnâ€™t appear to be too worried about its old pitchmanâ€™s move. “They’re using our 2002 pitchman because they’re finally catching up to our 2002 network,” said a Verizon spokesman told CNET.
