Taiwan Semiconductor: Outlook Still Good Despite Soft Guidance - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (NYSE:TSM) | Seeking Alpha Taiwan Semiconductor issued lower full-year revenue guidance during its latest earnings call, citing weaker growth in the semiconductor market. About the same time fresh speculation emerged that the company might get the Apple A9 chip business which Apple had given to GlobalFoundries. This new development, plus its 16nm nodes, might change the outlook for the company both in the current year and in the coming year. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's (NYSE: TSM ) first quarter fiscal 2015 report was something of a mixed bag as the company managed to deliver revenue in line with its guidance, beat slightly on its bottom line guidance but issued soft second quarter guidance. TSMC delivered revenue of NT$222B ($7.1B), and EPS of NT$3.05 (US$0.48 per ADR unit). The company, however, went ahead and lowered its second quarter revenue guidance to NT$204B-NT$207B ($6.53B-$6.62B, growth of 11%-13%) and full-year growth from 12% to 10%. Despite the lowered guidance, TSM shares sold off by only a small margin thanks mainly to its impressive top and bottom line growth, which clocked in at 49.8% and 65%, respectively. There are, however, several reasons that persuade me to believe that the soft guidance by the company was merely a one-off event and the near-term outlook still remains favorable. According to a report by a KGI Securities analyst, Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has made a ''last-minute decision'' to use TSM's foundries for its A9 chips for its upcoming iPhone 7. According to the analyst, Apple's snap decision was prompted by unusually poor yields by GlobalFoundries' 14nm processes, which the analysts said were currently around 30%. Yields below 50% are normally considered unsatisfactory, and a 30% yield is simply terrible. That of course is great news for TSM investors. But there are a few questions that it brings up, the biggest being why not use Samsung's (OTC: OTC: OTC:SSNLF ) 14nm FinFET nodes instead of TSM's 16nm nodes? There are a few plausible explanations why Apple might have opted for TSM instead of Samsung. After all, multiple reports have already indicated that Samsung is likely to enjoy the lion's share of the AP chip business. The first reason is leverage. According to an earlier report by KGI Securities, Samsung was slated to share delivery of A9 chips with GlobalFoundries in a 3:1 ratio. In other words, Samsung already has 75% of the A9 chip business. Giving the other 25% share to the company would give Samsung too much leverage over Apple, which is generally not a good thing to do. The second reason is that Samsung might simply not be in a position to deliver the goods since it needs 14nm nodes for itself. Samsung needs a good amount of those 14nm nodes for its Samsung Galaxy S6. Samsung S6 is proving to be wildly popular, with the phone selling out in stores across the country. This high demand may have exceeded Samsung's projections, forcing it to concentrate on producing the chips for its own smartphone. It's even possible that Global foundries may be busy right now making those Exynos chips for Samsung's flagship phone. A third reason could be that Apple is wary of Samsung's 14nm nodes. After all, Samsung last year agreed to license its 14nm technology to GlobalFoundries. If GlobalFoundries 14nm nodes sport such poor yields, then it raises a lot of questions about Samsung's own fabrication process. If the two companies share the same fabrication technology, it's hard to understand how one company can have yields as low as 30% while the other has, say, 60%. I've tried digging deeper into this but I have not been able to come up with anything conclusive so I'm left to assume there could be a fundamental flaw with Samsung's 14nm fabrication technology. While we may or may not eventually get to know the rationale behind Apple's decision, there are still a few questions that need answers. The first is whether Apple intends to use two distinct nodes, the 16nm and 14nm, on the iPhone 7? TSM has been touting the qualities of its 16nm nodes and I have read several reports saying that the nodes are impressive. I would, however, believe that there are some performance gaps between the 14nm and the 16nm nodes, no matter how small. But, this might not be a major consideration because Apple might find a way to compensate for that. The more important question is how Apple can make the decision to give TSM a considerable amount of A9 business on a dime just like that. Unless of course Apple had all along foreseen the possibility of the current GlobalFoundries fiasco and had taken the trouble to design the A9 for TSM's 16nm nodes as well, in which case it would be a laudable foresight on Apple's part. If TSM ends up getting the A9 business, it should have no trouble at all delivering Apple's orders. The company cut down its capex projection by $1 billion and lowered its gross margin outlook by 100 basis points citing lower fab utilization during the second half of the year. The company also added that the processes and equipment used in its 16nm nodes and its 20nm nodes were 90% similar, which has helped it ramp up the production of 16nm nodes at a faster rate than what it had earlier projected. The company, therefore, appears to have adequate capacity to handle the extra business from Apple. The reports that TSM's 16nm nodes have great features appears credible when you consider that Apple plans to give 100% of its iPhone A10 chip business and another 100% of the iPad and Mac A9X chip business to the company in 2016. In fact, TSM has already declared that it expects its 16nm nodes to do as well as its 28nm nodes. TSM's 28nm nodes are still the company's best-performing nodes. The nodes have been shipping for 14 quarters now and the demand is still high. (click to enlarge) TSM also added that it expects to have a bigger market share of the 14/16nm nodes, meaning it expects its 16nm nodes to do better than Samsung's 14nm nodes. It's hard to tell whether TSM had factored in the A9 business from Apple when it issued the lower guidance for the current year. Chances are that it had not done that so that gives the company a good chance to beat on its own guidance by the end of the year. The outlook for TSM's 16nm appears to be bright in the coming year, so investors should treat the lower guidance as a minor speed bump.
