Apple Has Room To Drop 16% - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple's plans for substantial growth in India seem too dubious to be a major catalyst for growth. Based on previous valuations of Apple, I believe the stock may pose a 16% downside in the near term. The biggest upside to Apple, which I believe is holding them from dropping further, is their strong dividend and share buybacks. Some investors believe Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has bottomed to the point where it stands as a value play. At its current price I strongly disagree with that investment thesis. Historically speaking, Apple has traded at a lower valuation when it was far better positioned. I believe Apple's growth strategy in India presents an overly optimistic view to help move them on track to future growth. With declining revenue and too much uncertainty in their plans to expand in India, I believe the stock can still drop another 16% from its current price. Apple investors are looking towards India as the catalyst needed to boost topline growth, but to me, India is more of a distraction from declining revenues in China. Apple already has a presence in India, but now they are going into growth mode. Their solution? Apple Stores. The problem is that Apple faces significant hurdles for India to really make a significant impact on their financials. The 30% content manufacturing rule? Well, that one they'll beat. But how do they plan to compete with the well-established Android phones? This is where the risk for Apple's venture into India is realized. A retail storefront may be a good marketing strategy, but projecting the ROI on it is difficult. Apple saw a 56% increase in sales in India last quarter, which should tell you how small their presence is in the Android dominated market. And with Apple's cheapest phones selling for more than $400 compared to Android's $120 phones, how on earth could Apple compete? It's going to be very difficult. China had far more people who could afford the iPhone when Apple launched there than India has. With less than 2% of Indians earnings more than $20 per day, Apple is going to have an extremely hard time eating up a significant amount of Android's market share without a very strong strategy that will most likely have to involve a noteworthy reduction in their operating margin. What we have in India is an Android dominated market where far fewer customers can afford an iPhone than many investors may realize. It's not impossible for Apple to gain some traction in India, but they will need to go far beyond their marketing strategy of Apple stores. The biggest roadblock isn't going to be getting people in front of their products, but it's going to be their pricing strategy. So Why Do I Think Apple Can Still Drop Another 16%? As a value play, I look straight to the balance sheet and see where Apple has traded in comparison to their price to tangible book value in the past. As you can see from the chart below, Apple fell to a pretty surprising valuation in 2013, with a market cap below $400 billion and a price to tangible book ratio below 3. It is interesting because at this time Apple had a trailing 3-year CAGR of 38% and saw a 17% CAGR for the 2 years following. Today, Apple has a trailing 3-year CAGR of only 14% and is projecting negative future growth. So, in 2013 Apple traded significantly lower than their current valuation but was much better positioned. Looking at the chart, you can make the case that Apple is trading at a premium today. Apple's operating margin was the same three years ago as it is today, and we certainly can't blame the overall market in 2013 for dragging down Apple as the S&P was up 26%. In 2013, Apple's operating margin did decline, but revenue increased. So far for 2016, Apple's revenue and operating margin are down and I believe it is a fair assumption to assume bother will fall for the fiscal year. Apple is a strong brand and they are going to be around for a long time, but like I said before, I believe they are worse positioned today than they were three years ago. We already know about Apple's receding revenue, but I also believe investors should be worried about Apple's operating margin beginning to fall as well. With Apple's bread and butter being the iPhone, history has shown us that margins on consumer electronics can take a significant hammering over time as they compete against an increasingly competitive market. I think Apple can still drop down to a 3.5X price to tangible book value, which is still not as low as they were three years ago, to a market cap of about $426 billion, or about $78 per share. I am not going to negate Apple's strong dividend and share buybacks, which I strongly support. Their yield sits around 2.44% with a payout ratio of only 23.46% - not too shabby. And that, combined with their share buybacks could be the reason that Apple is not falling back down to their valuation of 2013. In hindsight, I think the investors who complained about Apple's dividends and share buybacks under Tim Cook should actually be pleased with that decision, otherwise I believe things could be gloomier for Apple right now. Nevertheless, I do see a path for double digit downside in the near term if the markets remain volatile. Apple can still be a good long-term play for investors, but volatile markets, uncertain growth strategies, and declining margins may soon offer investors a better purchase price.
