Does Disney Have An Ace Up Its Sleeve In The Streaming Wars? - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Bret Kenwell , Future Blue Chips (22 clicks) Sep. 25, 2015  9:55 AM ET  |  About: The Walt Disney Company (DIS) , Includes: CMCSA , DISH , FOX , NFLX by: Bret Kenwell Streaming has gained momentum, but not all companies are subject to lose. Disney, Twenty-First Century Fox and Comcast's NBC are the joint owners of Hulu -- a hedge against the growing world of streaming. Shares of Disney have sold off too much, given its leading position in different businesses, along with this Hulu hedge. In early August, Disney (NYSE: DIS ) reported its third quarter earnings results. While the numbers were pretty good, a few comments from CEO Bob Iger confirmed what too many investors had hoped would never come: ESPN subscriber loss. While the company has done a great job diversifying its business - with theme parks, cruises, movies and television - the strategy has become skewed toward the media segment. It led the way in Q3 with $5.77 billion in revenues, making up 44% of the company's total sales for the quarter. At the same time, these comments were only deeply concerning if you turned off the conference call after the first five minutes, curled up in a ball and cried yourself to sleep. Because further along in the call , Iger seemed relatively upbeat about the situation, highlighting that 96% of sports programs are viewed live, which is good for advertising. Ad dollars for the quarter rose roughly 5% for ESPN, when excluding the "difficult comparison with the Men's World Cup in Q3 last year, which more than offset the benefit of an additional game of the NBA Finals in Q3 this year," Iger explained. He's being realistic, for sure, but that's what you want to hear from the leader of a company you own: The truth. In fact, Iger says basic TV bundles will do fine going forward, because the pricing is "fair and appropriate." I think that's true for most households, as I outlined last week. But what if he's wrong? Investors are revaluing shares of content companies, gauging what the damage will be from cord-cutting. Not all are created equal though. Several of these companies have an ace up their sleeve that few investors seem to acknowledge. Yes, I'm talking about the valuable asset that Disney, Twenty-First Century Fox (NASDAQ: FOX ) (NASDAQ: FOXA ) and Comcast's (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) (NASDAQ: CMCSK ) NBC Universal own: Hulu. Like Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ), Hulu is a pay-per-month streaming service. Rather than having a plethora of original, dated and relatively new content though, Hulu thrives on streaming recently-aired content. This includes the likes of "Modern Family" and "The Tonight Show." In 2013 the trio put Hulu up for sale, only to pull it off the auction block and instead pump it with $750 million to fuel future growth . I think this was a good move. Hulu is gaining in popularity, with subscribers up 50% year-over-year to 9 million as of April. Viewings are up are as well, climbing 30% over last year's figures, while a growing number of that is coming from mobile devices. Think of Hulu like a hedge for the three companies. For Disney in particular, it could leverage Hulu to add on offerings like ESPN for an additional monthly fee. For example, Hulu starts at $7.99 per month, but consumers can tack on Showtime for an additional $8.99. In a recent conference, Disney COO Tom Staggs noted how viewership and the number of devices accessing ESPN Watch (the company's online streaming network), is also seeing robust growth, up 60% and 50%, respectively. So when the time comes, why couldn't Disney role out its own standalone ESPN streaming service, and make it as an additional tack-on to Hulu too? Furthermore, between the content power and licensing agreements these three companies have, Hulu could become its own version of an online streaming skinny bundle service - where consumers have the power to start with a basic package, and pay for additional channel packages, much like Dish Network's (NASDAQ: DISH ) Sling TV . Given the companies' content and Hulu's extremely up-to-date shows, this could be a very viable option in the future. Hulu personnel is also promising, particularly Jenny Wall, the head of marketing. Beginning her career with HBO and working most recently with Netflix, she helped launch campaigns for original series like "Orange is the New Black," as well as led the global creative team's brand campaigns. I think she'll be able grow Hulu's domestic and international distribution, and reach to consumers. Hulu has three big content providers - the juggernaut being Disney - capable of driving subscribers to the platform. From that April presentation (linked above), Hulu CEO Mike Hopkins said, "If you take only one thing away this morning, know that 2015 is the year Hulu will break out." I think he might be right. While Netflix is the clear leader, Hulu still has a lot of ground to make up, with some pretty big backers as well While Hulu is a nice side business for Disney and the others, it could have a much larger role if the streaming wars continue to heat up. For its part, I think Disney's near 20% selloff is a bit much, considering it has a diversified portfolio, ongoing strength in its media business, and a worthy hedge in Hulu against the streaming wars. Iger has been an extremely good manager up until now, and I'm not about to start doubting him going forward. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
