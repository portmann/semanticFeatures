Intel Is Dead Money In 2015 - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha While I had high expectations going into the year, I'm starting to retract those expectations based on comments from management and an underwhelming outlook. PCCG substantially underperformed this year. Based on the comments from management it's likely to swing a full 10 percentage points into the negative this year. Furthermore, the remaining segments couldn't offset the negatives from a contracting PC market. I don't think PC volumes will recover in the back half based on Brian's comments on inventory. Therefore, I'm slashing my price target from $36 to $30. I'm lowering my recommendation to a hold. The stock might recover following the investor meeting in Q4 of 2015. This is going to be the hardest article I write about Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) as I had a lot of conviction going into the year about the company's underlying fundamentals, future growth potential and capital program. Of course, one thing after another. Things eventually unraveled as the company pursued acquisitions that weren't popular among the shareholder ranks, PC market contracted in 2015 and the enterprise segment and mobile didn't generate enough growth to offset the negatives. As a result of these factors I'm lowering my price target a little more this year. I'm starting to realize that while the stock could recover on better than expected earnings over the next two quarters, there's little reason to believe that the beats will come from topline surprises. Therefore, my expectations have been lowered even further after having already lowered my estimates in the prior quarter. Based on the comments from the management team, I have reconstructed my estimates for the various segments. PCCG will contract by 9% year-over-year, and DCG will grow by 15%. Both segments generate high profit margins, but the bad from PCCG can't be offset by the good from DCG this year. The remaining segments will grow, but at a more modest mid single-digit growth rate this year. Revenue is going to contract by approximately 1% unless if PC volumes pick-up in the back half of the year. Brian Krzanich (CEO of Intel) from earnings conference call: While our overall billings roughly matched our forecast, PC supply chain inventories declined at a slower rate than we expected, as PC demand weakened further. While we are expecting a seasonal second half, we're now forecasting total revenue to decline by about 1% for the full year, down from our prior expectation of approximately flat. Initially my expectations were high, but in the most recent earnings conference call, Brian mentioned that inventory isn't clearing from the channels all that effectively. Replacement demand is likely to be offset by excessive inventory in various retail channels. If anything, newer PCs are going to compete with older PCs that are priced a little cheaper. Those older PCs will come with a free upgrade to Windows 10. Therefore, there's little incentive for consumers to pay for Skylake when they can get by on Haswell parts. Based on the expense guidance, and the inclusion of a lower effective tax rate, I believe EPS is going to remain flat year-over-year. The EPS figure could perform slightly better if in the event Intel is able to close the Altera deal prior to year-end, and is able to combine Altera earnings with Intel earnings. In that case scenario I see the stock trading at $31.10 with EPS of $2.41. However, if Altera deal isn't closed by the end of the year, then the EPS figure will come in at around $2.32. Therefore my EPS range is $2.32 to $2.41. Furthermore, my price target range is $29.95 to $31.10. Currently the stock is trading at around fair value, according to my estimates. Therefore, the stock isn't going to move much higher, and isn't going to drop any further. I wouldn't be surprised if the stock consolidates into a sideways pattern up until the fall investor meeting, where Intel will go over next-year earnings and sales growth estimates. Assuming Intel is able to squeeze out a couple costs pertaining to mobile, sustains NAND memory growth, and DCG performs in-line, the stock will find support in the low $30s. Given the weak outlook, and the need for more time to realize growth in investment principal I'm lowering my rating on Intel from a buy to a hold rating. I'm lowering my price target from $36.22 to $30.52. Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.
