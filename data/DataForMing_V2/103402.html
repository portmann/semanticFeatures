How To Make Sure Apple Music Doesn’t Automatically Charge You After The Free 3-Month Trial Ends â€“ Consumerist Whoops! It looks like portions of our site are being blocked! Check your browser settings or contact your network administrator. What’s that you say? You don’t like paying for things unexpectedly and automatically? Then if you’re trying Apple Music during the three months that it’s free, you’ll want to make sure to prevent it from charging your credit card when the trial is over. The card you have on file with your Apple ID will get charged either for the $9.99/month or the $14.99 per month family plan, this of course, depends on what you chose when you signed up. You can either cancel your subscription completely or just set it to not auto-renew, so that you can make that choice whenever you want manually after the three-month period is up. â€¢ Click on your account in the upper right hand of iTunes — this should have your name or Apple ID on it. â€¢ Navigate to “Account Info” and then settings, and click on “Manage” beside subscriptions. â€¢ Click “Edit” which is located next to “Apple Music Membership” — if you have multiple subscriptions. â€¢ Click on your account — again, the silhouette icon, on the upper left hand of the Apple Music app. â€¢ Next go to “View Apple ID,” then scroll down and hit “Manage” under the Subscriptions section. â€¢ Toggle the “auto-renewal” option to “Off” In either scenario this isn’t too tricky to do, but you might want to set a reminder for yourself for Sept. 29, or just switch it off now so you have no nasty surprise bills later.
