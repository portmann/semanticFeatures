Verizon: Dividend Increase On The Way, Here's What I Expect - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha It has been four quarters since Verizon last increased its dividend. Verizon has a lot of debt on the balance sheet after acquiring the remaining stake in Verizon Wireless, which puts a limit on how much it can raise the dividend. Still, Verizon generates huge amounts of free cash flow. That will allow for the debt to be repaid over time, and also a modest dividend increase. Here is what I'm expecting for Verizon's coming dividend raise. Telecommunications stocks are prized by investors for their high dividend yields. Not only do they pay high current yields, but they are also reliable dividend growth stocks as well. This is possible because telecoms generate rich amounts of free cash flow, which they return to investors primarily through dividends. Each year in early September, Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ ) increases its dividend. It's that time of year again, which means investors can expect Verizon to send more money their way very soon. Here is a breakdown of how Verizon is doing this year so far, and what kind of dividend increase can be expected. Despite the current panic sweeping through the markets, it's been another business-as-usual year for Verizon. While investors fret about the prospect of slowing economic growth in China, this is immaterial for Verizon investors. That's because Verizon derives its business entirely in the United States, which is proving to be a very valuable shelter from the global economic storms right now. Over the first half of 2015, Verizon generated $10.7 billion of free cash flow. Free cash flow increased 69% from the same six-month period last year. Verizon's growth is impressive, and it's due primarily to its wireless business. Verizon Wireless grew revenue 5.3% last quarter, year over year. Verizon Wireless is highly regarded as a premier service in the United States, thanks to the high quality of its network. That allows Verizon to reap incredible margins on its wireless services. Last quarter, EBITDA margin in wireless came in at 56%, up nearly six full percentage points year over year. The great thing about Verizon is its high degree of stability. As one of the biggest telecoms in the industry, Verizon enjoys what Warren Buffett would call a large economic moat. Providing nationwide cable, Internet, and phone service is an industry nearly impossible for new competition due to the extremely high costs of building out a network. This means that the barriers to entry are very high, which results in reliable free cash flow. In fact, that is probably why Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.B ) purchased 11 million shares of Verizon last year . On the surface, Verizon's huge cash flow could conceivably allow for mid-to-high single digit dividend increases. But unfortunately, Verizon has a debt-laden balance sheet, due to the huge acquisition of its wireless business last year. Recall that Verizon purchased the remaining 45% of Verizon Wireless that it didn't already own, from Vodafone (NASDAQ: VOD ). That cost Verizon $130 billion, and has saddled the company with a lot of debt. At the end of the last quarter, Verizon's long-term debt stood at $109 billion. The deal carried an enormous price tag, but the rationale is clear. Verizon Wireless is simply a gold mine. According to the company , Verizon Wireless is the largest and most profitable wireless carrier in the United States. The acquisition was immediately accretive to earnings. Shortly after the deal, Verizon stated it added 10% growth to earnings per share last year. The wireless business should continue to add to overall growth going forward. And, while Verizon's debt load is concerning, it's worth noting that Verizon's free cash flow should allow the company to pay this down over time. Verizon generated more than $22 billion in free cash flow just last year. This should be enough to gradually improve its financial condition, as well as grow its dividend, albeit modestly. It has been four quarters since Verizon last increased its dividend, and I fully expect it to raise its dividend in the coming days. The first reason is because Verizon's dividend, while robust as it is, only accounts for a modest portion of free cash flow. Verizon's free cash flow payout ratio, which utilizes free cash flow instead of traditional earnings per share, is a very comfortable 39%. Verizon's high free cash flow will easily allow for a nice dividend raise. After digesting all this information, it seems prudent to expect a dividend raise that exceeds inflation, but falls short of double-digits due to Verizon's bloated balance sheet. I'm expecting a 3%-6% raise. That would take Verizon's annualized dividend to roughly $2.26 per share-$2.33 per share. At $45 per share, that would bring Verizon's yield to 5%-5.2%. If that sounds attractive to income investors, Verizon looks like a worthy addition to a dividend-focused portfolio.
