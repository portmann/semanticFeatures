Instagram Sees Posts Slowing - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Instagram is seeing posts by users decline. This is because only certain pictures are socially acceptable to be shared on the app. There has been a new story circulating the web as now it appears the amount of sharing on Instagram is declining much in the same vain as original sharing has been declining on Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ). This means Facebook is in double trouble as its app, which was supposed to be capturing young people who share every waking moment of their lives on the internet, has begun to peak. If you take a 10,000 feet approach while looking at social media, Instagram is much more limited than Facebook in its scope. Facebook has been the go to place to connect with friends and family members. Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) is where you interact with people with similar interests who you may not know in real life. Instagram was founded on the ability to share your best photos in a fashion that makes them look more professional or artsy because of filters, which was a unique feature at the time it was launched. Most readers can attest to the fact that they see the same picture on Instagram as Facebook anyway, so the uniqueness of the app has eroded. Twitter often provides examples of how a public official like the President or the Pope has used the app to make a pivotal statement. While investors may scoff at this as storytelling, I think there is an argument to be made that this makes the app more sustainable. That has been proven by the way Twitter maintains its relevancy even as its user growth slows and stock declines. I think if Twitter management recognized what goals the company should have, it could be a sustainable business. Instagram is a less serious platform than Facebook and Twitter. As has been spoken about endlessly, Twitter isn't the most user-friendly social media app in the world. Instagram has predicated its success on being user friendly as it made it easier to make your photos and now videos look better. Although we have seen Instagram's monthly active users increase at a much faster clip than Twitter's, if the app has less necessary and serious content than its popularity is more in danger of being lost. News isn't broken on Instagram. The news of your family member having a baby is broken on Facebook and the news of an international crisis is broken on Twitter. Being cool is not sustainable. If Instagram disappeared tomorrow, would anyone notice? My theory on serious content being more sustainable than selfies is supported by Snapchat's (Private: CHAT ) movement towards bringing in traditional firms to have articles as well as its coalescence of users' videos to create makeshift coverage of a news event. Snapchat knows that it cannot rely on users taking pictures with silly filters forever, so it is trying to use its popularity to pivot into being the center of the online conversation surrounding news events. The reason these stories of declines in sharing n Instagram are shocking to some investors is because they see all the charts of users going up in a straight line. The reality is total usage is the only thing that matters. Monthly active users is a blurry picture (daily users would be better) of half the story with the other half being time spent per user. Do you really think that usage on Facebook and Instagram always goes up in a straight line? When Facebook went public, the company was looked at with a microscope because it was in a new category. Now when Instagram passes 500 million monthly active users, investors exclaim that now is the time to buy as if this number has any relevance. You won't hear why Instagram posts are declining because a lot of journalists and investors covering the story, don't use the app. They get a random token teenager and ask him/her what the best social media apps are and then make it into a news story. The teenager doesn't have an analytical mind, so the task of using your mind to get into what the teenager is thinking can be a difficult one. The reason why Instagram's posts are declining is because the app is about perfection. Pictures have to be flawless in order to be posted on the app. Pictures have to be deemed "Instagram worthy" or else they are discarded. On Snapchat users don't worry about what they are posting because there are no likes or comments and the content deletes after 24 hours. You just film your monotonous life to share it with your friends. The competitive advantage Snapchat has over Instagram, is that most people spent their lives doing boring things. They don't go out to eat or go on vacation often which means there isn't a need to share on Instagram. My assertion has been backed up by survey data. As you can see in the Piper Jaffray survey , Snapchat has now leapt above Instagram in usage among teens. The trend towards Snapchat shows no signs of stopping. As the app becomes used more prevalently, it will start to eat into the time spent on Instagram. Instagram's problem is that it is too important. Because photos fill the whole screen unlike tweets, each post is important. If you post too much, you are called a spammer. If you use Twitter, you can see actual spam bot accounts which post clickbait links. But in Instagram's case, users are calling their friends spammers. Users discouraging their friends to post can work in the reverse for Instagram and cause it to lose its popularity. It's like a popular girl in high school who dismissed every 'promposal' she received and ended up with no date to the prom. There has been possible changes to improve Instagram floated around. One possibility is to add the ability to share a post like the equivalent of a retweet. This would be terrible because users are already obsessive about what they see on their feed. They do not want to see what the accounts they follow think is interesting. If they did want to see that, they can just go to the part of the app which has which shows what their friends are liking. It's not as if Instagram will ever have a breaking news story that people must see anyway. Adding a re-gram feature would be like adding to the character count on Twitter which users have balked at. There is also proposals to add features such as 360 video to Instagram. This won't help either. This concept that new features don't make a difference has gone against my previous analysis of Twitter when I was bullish on the stock. It's the opposite of what you would think, which is why it's understandable for me to have been wrong. The best example of this is Vine. Vine is much easier to use and has much more features than it had when it was more popular. Vine wasn't able to keep its creators on the platform as they moved to YouTube because Vine is too limiting of a form factor. Inherent flaws in the make-up of a social media app are masked by popularity, but then emerge when the fad fades. Instagram is built on perfect pictures which limits sharing. This is the inherent flaw in the app which cannot be changed no matter how many new features are added. There is another thesis to the ark of social media firms which can never be distinctly proven. That thesis is ads cause users to leave the social apps. This means social users are not as valuable as expected because they can never be monetized fully since they will always leave if too many ads are shown. This changes how investors value these firms. Facebook is a story stock, so the narrative matters more than other firms like an Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM ). The original narrative went Facebook went public was that Facebook was slowing. This changed when investors saw the emergence of Instagram. The only thing this did was buy Facebook time. Teens are now moving away from Instagram and towards Snapchat. The less posting there is on the app, the less Instagram becomes necessary. It becomes a self-fulling downward spiral to irrelevance. No one knows if Instagram will be able to keep its importance among fickle teens, so why buy Facebook stock thinking Instagram has a lock on young users?
