(NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha May 31 2016, 14:13 ET | By: Eric Jhonsa, SA Eye on Tech , SA News Editor In a report stating Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is moving to a 3-year iPhone upgrade cycle , Japan's Nikkei reports 2017 iPhones will be able to "create more complex tactile vibrations on the display because of a tiny, but high-performance motor equipped inside." Haptic tech developer Immersion ( IMMR +6.8%) appears to be getting a lift from the report. Immersion, which has haptics licensing deals with many Android OEMs, is less than four months removed from suing Apple and AT&T for allegedly infringing its IP.
