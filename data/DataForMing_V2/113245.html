Can Apple Add Enough Hardware To Keep The iPhone Relevant? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple will implement force touch into the iPhone, and it's not clear whether users will successfully adopt the new feature. Furthermore, there are rumors floating around over the removal of the home button. However, an equally compelling case can be made that Apple will keep the home button and will offer a joystick mode for gamers. Storage capacity, uplink and downlink, GPU, CPU and sensor technology will still improve at an exponential pace. The next killer app going into the Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPhone 6S is Force Touch, which basically allows for a more responsive user interface based on how much force is pressed on the screen. For the most part, it's a very marginal change that could either frustrate or add value to the user experience. Imagine if you had used an iPhone and experienced the same reaction from an app whenever you clicked it. But upon getting frustrated you started tapping your phone more aggressively and ended up with a separate set of interactions with your application. You'll wonder if the iPhone is broken or if it's a glitch. It's not exactly clear whether the adoption of Force Touch will be successful, in other words. Furthermore, many developers will have to buy into the technology and figure out ways to maximize the potential of it. Again, there's a lot of "ifs" to make this work. However, the upside to force touch is more capability. For example, the mouse has two button clicks, the left and right click. In the case of the iPhone you have a home button and touch screen. There are limited ways to interact with applications, which has been a problem for quite a while. However, Apple can address this by offering Force Touch, which adds an additional dimension to the user experience. There also are rumors about the loss of the home button. I'm not sure how Apple will replace the back button that works universally across apps. There has to be a countervailing force that prioritizes functionality beyond the software layer and is built into the hardware without requiring even more complex gestures. Remember, Apple was built on "simple is better. "Therefore, Apple's design of an iPhone without a home button would be disastrous and I don't anticipate such a device to be released for quite a while, if ever. Losing the home button is like losing the back button on the Internet. It would be a situation where less would equate into less. Also, perceptions are based on heuristic thinking, and what shapes elegant design is sometimes maintaining the core elements of a product intact. Like, for example, if someone removed the grill on a car, just because they can, will it look better? Of course not, and even if it was mechanically feasible, it would look ridiculous to everyone else who owns a car. Even a Tesla Model S has a grill for the sake of aesthetics. The engine is underneath the car and is cooled with a very different airflow mechanism. Therefore, the Models S doesn't require a front grill. Even so, Tesla opted for a design with a grill for the sake of conformity. The most consistent design element of the iPhone has been the home button over its entire existence. Therefore, the device would have an identity crisis if it lost the one thing that made the iPhone an iPhone. If anything, I'm certain Apple is just experimenting with designs that exclude the home button, but upon test-marketing the device would fail utterly and Apple would have no choice but to keep the home button. If anything, Apple will use the home button for a more advanced design. An actual patent of a joystick that pops out of the iPhone upon pressing down on the home button circulated the news media earlier in the year. My guess is that the appeal of a joystick will outweigh the advantages of removing the home button entirely. Therefore, the iPhone will probably have a home button that looks like this. This would broaden the appeal of mobile gaming just when hardware is getting powerful enough to run more graphically intense applications. The market for iPhone games is large, but it caters to an audience that plays turn-based strategy games, because the user interface isn't powerful enough to allow for more complex gestures. Furthermore, there's plenty of evidence that suggests that smartphone gaming is cannibalizing mobile game franchises from Sony (NYSE: SNE ) and Nintendo. Therefore, Apple could be in a position to dominate mobile gaming as implementing a pop out joystick would enable higher levels of engagement on top grossing mobile games. A huge chunk of the transactional volume on the Apple store comes from games, so there's plenty of financial incentive for Apple to go the joystick route instead of the no home button route. Plenty to gain in one case, and plenty to lose in the other. This should be a no brainer. Needless to say, there are other aspects of the upcoming iPhone that could surprise us. Like a more flexible iPhone (for what purpose, vanity?) The device will obviously have faster components and a more capable OS. 3D NAND will lower flash memory costs, so at some point I anticipate that iPhones will come in 256GB or 512 GB variants, which sounds crazy, but is in-line with the rapid advances in flash storage technology. I anticipate that Apple will release a massive improvement in memory without raising its prices, which will drive demand at some point further on down the road. There also will be an eventual transition to 5G LTE over the next three to five years. Qualcomm already has the technology in development and it will likely be released sometime in the 2017 to 2020 timeframe. I'm confident that Apple can include enough technological advances to keep the device relevant in the eyes of consumers. I don't think a more elongated refresh cycle will occur in the next five years because there's room to develop more powerful hardware and a better user interface while making reasonable adjustments to design. Rest assured, the fanatics will keep coming back for more. Of course there's a finite supply of potential customers, but given the low enough price point, and the broadening of wealth in emerging economies, I believe that Apple is nowhere near market saturation. Therefore, growth will likely continue, which supports my suspicion that Apple will be able to finish FY 2015 strong but will also sustain momentum over the next five years.
