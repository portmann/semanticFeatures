Comcast: Universal Studios Is Having A Record Breaking Year For Films - Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) | Seeking Alpha Universal Studio's "Minions" movie looks like a box office hit. Universal's 2015 film releases so far have pulled in more revenue that 2013's record $3.69 billion. It looks like Comcast Corporation's (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) Universal Studios has another hit on its hands. The new Minions movie has opened its first weekend with total worldwide box office of $395.7 million. The $115.2 million domestic gross is the second-largest record for an animated film on a debut weekend, just below the $121 million Shrek the Third took in 2007. That first weekend earned more than the two previous Despicable Me films that featured the yellow Minion stars. Even adult viewers have shown an attraction for the characters, so the film is growing revenues on a wide age base. Universal reported a high percentage of US Minions viewers in the US were over 25, and almost half were going to the film not as part of a family. 2015 is turning out to be a very lucrative year for Universal films. The overwhelmingly successful Jurassic World shot out of the gate and reached $1 billion in the box office in thirteen days. The fast car movie Furious 7 set out in high gear, racking up $1.51 billion to date. 76% of the total was from the international market. There was also 50 Shades of Grey with its worldwide box office of $570 million to date. All the Universal films released in 2015 combined so far have surpassed the production company's 2013 record of $3.69 billion worldwide. This year has turned into a race with Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS ) with its hit film The Avengers: Age of Ultron to be followed up by the highly anticipated Star Wars 7 release in December. Universal may hold the lead right now, but some early projections are for the new Star Wars movie to potentially gross $1.7-$3 billion, which may tip the scale towards Disney. Of course, the business opportunities don't stop there. With each successful film will come toys and other consumer goods for the entertainment company to boost their revenues. In addition, Universal Studios has added new ride attractions at its California theme park for Furious 7 and Jurassic World. Next year, the theme park will open the new Wizarding World of Harry Potter, which should be a hit as well. 2016 could be a great year for theme park visitor attendance. Comcast has done pretty well with its 2011 acquisition of NBCUniversal. In 2014, Universal had its most profitable year, and Universal Studios theme park visitors totaled $1.4 billion. From there, Comcast has rolled into a strong first quarter, beating analyst estimates on both the top and bottom lines. NBCUniversal segment revenue gained 7.9% overall, and within that Theme Parks revenue shot up 33.7% to $651 million for Q1. The two big divisions of this segment, Cable Networks and Broadcast Television, were down for the quarter, yet that was mostly from hard comparable revenues against last year's Super Bowl and the Sochi Olympics. The company's diluted EPS gained 14% for the quarter, but it concerns me that it that is lower than the annual EPS growth track record. Over the past 3-year and 5-year periods, EPS grew an average annual 28% and 20%, respectively, I hope the recent film box office success will help deliver better results in the next quarter. Although Comcast is generating solid returns, I still prefer Walt Disney. Disney's earnings growth is trending up higher in recent years, and the net income margin is somewhat better than Comcast's. Both companies are quality stocks, so you should benefit from owning either one. I would rather have Walt Disney over the long run because of the strong brand name and consumer appeal that the franchise has.
