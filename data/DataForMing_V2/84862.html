These scores, conclusions and list were compiled below were based on closing prices June 8 as compared to analyst median targets one year out. 3 actionable conclusions:1. BDCs pursued two objectives: limited investments, or undisclosed investment targets in mid-market firms.2. Top 10 BDCs averaged 19.57% upsides3. 10 BDCs best upsides ranged from to 31.03%. Top ten upsiders per analyst 2016 targets were: PSEC, TPVG, CODI; HTGC. Yield (dividend / price) results from Yahoo Finance as of market closing prices June 10 for Business Development Company Stocks listed here were compared with analyst 1-yr target projections to reveal three actionable conclusions discussed below. After June 2014, the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses (AFFE) provision of the SEC prompted both Russell and S&P 500 to remove 40 BDC dogs from their primary equity indices. Thereafter, it became appropriate to track BDC puppy progress as a pack. This is one more such progress report. Since late 2011, a series of Arnold reports showed results of dog dividend methodology used to uncover possible buy opportunities in each of eight major market sectors listed by Yahoo Finance. Reader suggestions inspired our first dividend dog analysis of the Business Development Company industry within the financials ( Fins ) sector after August 2014. This article provided follow-up. Written to reveal bargain stocks to buy and hold one full year, this article is supported by previous efforts. See Dow 30 article for explanation of the term "dogs" for stocks reported based on Michael B. O'Higgins book "Beating The Dow" (HarperCollins, 1991), now named Dogs of the Dow . O'Higgins system works to find bargains in any collection of dividend paying stocks. Ten top Business Development Company dogs showing the best price upsides into 2016 were culled from this list of 39 stocks by yield as of 6/10/15. Ten business development company upside leaders as of June 10 were either looking to invest growth capital limited to $3m to $1.5b or did not disclose their investment objectives for profitable small to middle market private businesses with revenues over $10 million operating in lucrative niche industries. Three disclosed their financial aims: Medley Capital (NYSE: MCC ) $10/50m; Full Circle Capital (NASDAQ: FULL ) $3/10m; Compass Diversified Holdings (NYSE: CODI ) $10/40m. Seven did not disclose their investment limits: TICC Capital (NASDAQ: TICC ); Prospect Capital (NASDAQ: PSEC ); Stellus Capital Investment (NYSE: SCM ); Capitala Finance (NASDAQ: CPTA ); Fifth Street Finance (NASDAQ: FSC ); Hercules Technology Growth Capital (NYSE: HTGC ); Triple Point Venture Growth BDC (NYSE: TPVG ). Historic prices and actual dividends paid from $30,000 invested as $1k in each of the highest yielding stocks and the aggregate single share prices of those thirty stocks divided by 3 created data points for 2015. Projections based on estimated dividend amounts from $1000 invested in each of the thirty highest yielding stocks and aggregate one year analyst target share prices from Yahoo Finance divided by 3 created the 2016 data points green for price and blue for dividend. Analysts as reported by Yahoo, projected 10% lower dividend from $10K invested as $1k in ten dogs in this group while aggregate single share price for those ten was projected to increase 12% in the coming year. The number of analysts contributing to the mean target price estimate for each stock was noted in the next to the last column on the charts. Three to nine analysts was optimal for a valid projection estimate. Estimates provided by one analyst were not applied (n/a). A beta (risk) ranking for each stock was provided in the far right column of the above chart. A beta of 1 meant the stock's price would move with the market. Less than 1 showed lower than market movement. Higher than 1 showed greater than market movement. A negative beta number indicated the degree of a stocks movement opposite of market direction. Yahoo analyst 1 yr target reports put Prospect Capital in the lead by price upside from June 2015 to 2016. Notice, however, what happens when dividend growth and broker fees change the order of these ten stocks in the net gain article to follow. Six of the ten top dividend yield BDC dogs were verified as being among the ten upsiders for the coming year based on analyst 1 year target prices. So this period the dog strategy for the BDC industry as graded by Wall St. wizards was 60% accurate. Stocks listed above were suggested only as possible starting points for your index dog dividend stock purchase research process. These were not recommendations.
