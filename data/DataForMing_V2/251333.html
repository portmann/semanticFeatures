InvenSense: Watch For Leverage In The System - InvenSense (NYSE:INVN) | Seeking Alpha Stone Fox Capital , Stone Fox Capital (1,585 clicks) The gross margin pressure remains a prime reason that InvenSense is stuck with a valuation of $1 billion. The company is starting to show leverage in the operating expenses. Despite a solid quarter and some promising new technology announcements, InvenSense (NYSE: INVN ) still clings to a meager valuation. Unfortunately, the deal with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) to provide sensor technology for the iPhone 6/6-Plus has done nothing but hold the stock back. The motion tracking company is branching out into numerous non-mobile categories that provide the opportunity to double the total addressable market. The market, though, is still stuck on the margin impact of Apple as a customer. Due to this reason, the growth of the last few years hasn't been met with exploding bottom line improvements. Some signs are emerging of a better future. The biggest complaint with the financials of InvenSense is the weak gross margins. The company has long had a goal for gross margins to exceed 50%. The reality is that the addition of Apple as a customer and the market share gains have pressured the margin rate significantly. For FQ2, InvenSense only generated a gross margin rate of 44% due to Apple and a surprise ramp in the IoT category. Apple is expected to continue pressuring margins while the IoT category will eventually supply relieve on margins. The number was a sequential reduction in the gross margin rate, but an overall slight increase in gross profits to $46.6 million. The key, though, is that the market missed the improving leverage in the operating expenses. The combination of ramping up work for Apple and the numerous opportunities in the IoT category had the company spending aggressively during the prior periods. For the quarter, InvenSense actually grew sequential revenues by roughly $6.2 million and gross profits by $1.9 million while reducing operating expenses. The end result was a bottom line improvement by greater than the gross profit gain. Apple combined with Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) might continue pressing the peddle on pricing. The two combined for 53% of revenues so that is expected, but the number was down from 61% of revenues during FQ1. The key, though, is that the company no longer has to spend aggressively to keep these accounts with a technology lead on the competition. If anybody wants to know why InvenSense has an exciting technology business, a fast growth rate, and the stock hasn't gone anywhere in years, they need to look no further than the historical margin table. Over the course of the last two fiscal years, the operating margin eroded from 32% to only 14%. As mentioned above, the gross margin impact from Apple was only half the story. An equal impact was the increased spending on research in order to obtain the Apple business and to build a portfolio of sensing chips and software technology for the IoT revolution. The company is seeing some positive initial results in a shift toward IoT products in categories such as automotive, drones and virtual reality headsets with total revenues in the category increasing to 20%. InvenSense suggests the total gross margin will head back toward 50% with the growth from this category. As an example, if the company can hit $500 million in FY17 revenues (analysts forecast $477 million), an operating margin of 25% would yield operating income of $125 million. The number would nearly double the total for this year. Taking into account roughly $10 million in annual interest expense and a 15% tax rate, the net income would equate to nearly $100 million. With 92.5 million shares outstanding, InvenSense would easily top an EPS estimate of $1. The current FY17 estimate is $0.73. Remember that the above example is if the company gets back to FY14 operating margins of around 25%. InvenSense has a target to return to FY12 and FY13 operating margins that exceeded 30%. Achieving those margins would provide at least a 20% boost to the EPS estimates outlined above. The key takeaway is that market hasn't rewarded InvenSense for spending to build a strong future. The only focus right now is on the pricing pressure from Apple becoming a greater than 30% customer. The leverage in the system should provide substantial upside to EPS estimates over the next couple of years as the company increases gross margins while controlling operating expenses. The recommendation remains to buy InvenSense at this low market valuation of around $1 billion. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
