Disney Turns To Vice - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Dec.  9, 2015 11:29 AM ET  |  About: The Walt Disney Company (DIS) , Includes: AWAY , BABA , BEE , DD , DOW , FOXA , FXCB , ICON , MEG , NXST , SEAS , TWX , UVSP , YHOO by: Chris DeMuth Jr. Disney (NYSE: DIS ) is doubling its stake in Vice Media from $200 million to $400 million, increasing its position to around 10%. The added position is at the same valuation of around $4.4 billion. Vice is developing a new cable channel, Viceland , which launches February 28 and will reach 70 million U.S. homes. A&E, a JV between Hearst and Disney, invested $250 million, while Twenty-First Century Fox (NASDAQ: FOXA ) invested $70 million. Vice has a current show on Time Warner (NYSE: TWX )'s HBO. Vice's advantage for Disney is that it attracts a young audience including males to news programming. Disney's stock price is expensive on all metrics. As a resort, it is pricey compared to SeaWorld (NYSE: SEAS ); as a media company, it is expensive compared to Fox. As a Christmas story stock, it is expensive compared to Iconix (NASDAQ: ICON ). One could short DIS against any one of these or a basket of FOXA, SEAS, and ICON for a positive expected value. Yahoo! (NASDAQ: YHOO ) stopped its spin-off of its holdings in Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ). The board will evaluate alternative deal structures to separate the stake. Yahoo's assets and liabilities other than the Alibaba stake will probably be transferred to a newly formed company. The stock will be distributed to Yahoo shareholders resulting in two separated publicly traded companies. This plan will unlock significant after-tax value for YHOO holders. Today, YHOO's after-tax value, even after placing substantial discounts on the parts, is over 20% above its price. DuPont (NYSE: DD ) and Dow Chemical (NYSE: DOW ) are planning to merge. A deal will be announced later this week. The deal will be followed by a three-way breakup of the combined company into agriculture, materials, and specialty chemicals. The Dow standstill with Third Point expires this Sunday, December 13. That expiration is driving the timing of this deal process. DuPont's director nominations can be made next month. With Nelson Peltz watching carefully, DuPont lacks margin for error. A deal announced this week will give both companies relief from shareholder pressure. Nexstar (NASDAQ: NXST ) and Media General (NYSE: MEG ) have yet to reach a deal . As of today, the bid is $16.31, the ask is $18.60, and the reasonably likely outcome is a deal between $17 and $17.50. A deal could also include a CVR for the 2016 spectrum auction, which could represent additional value for MEG holders. Strategic Hotels & Resorts (NYSE: BEE ) shareholders approved the acquisition of the company. The deal will close on Friday, December 11th. An amendment to the proxy has been filed in regards to the proposed acquisition of HomeAway (NASDAQ: AWAY ). The $0.25 net arbitrage spread offers a 25% annual return if the deal closes next week. Aston Martin is preparing for a 2016 IPO. They are indefensibly beauties and only worthy of consideration for truly excess cash . To be continued in the New Year. Univest (NASDAQ: UVSP ) is buying Fox Chase (NASDAQ: FXCB ) for about $244 million. FXCB holders get $21 in cash, 0.9731 UVSP, or a combination subject to proration. The $0.45 net arbitrage spread offers a 4% annual return if the deal closes by next August.
