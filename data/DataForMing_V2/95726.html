Ford Will Soon Be Hitting On All Cylinders - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford saw a 1.3% decrease in US auto sales in May 2015 compared to May 2014 as the new F-150 aluminum-bodied model continued to see tight supply levels. Ford has sold 20K more Mustangs in the US year-to-date compared to the prior year in an effort to be the nation's best selling muscle car. Ford remains well positioned to take advantage of the encouraging US auto industry going forward and is a strong long-term investment. Ford (NYSE: F ) announced May 2015 US vehicle sales of 222K, down 1.3% from the same month in 2014. This 1.3% decrease came in slightly above the 3.3% decrease estimated by analysts. Ford's 1.3% year-over-year decrease came despite overall US auto sales crushing expectations for the month. With the poor winter weather behind consumers and gas prices remaining low, analysts are expecting 2015 sales to be 17.8 million. This, along with the Ford F-150's production nearing full levels and the return of the Mustang, I believe Ford is ready to turn the corner and hit on all cylinders. Of the major automakers, Hyundai (-10%) was the only one to have a larger decrease in year-over-year US sales. This is compared to other major automakers-Mercedes Benz (12.2%), Audi (11%), Volkswagen (8.1%), BMW (4.3%), Chrysler (4%), and GM (3%) that saw year-over-year increases. Despite the under whelming results for Ford in May, there continues to be positives to take away from the monthly sales reporting. The Ford F-150 production is continuing to ramp up the Kansas City assembly plant, which is expected to reach full production levels later this quarter. The Ford F-150, which underwent a drastic model change to an aluminum body starting with this year's model, has seen tight inventory levels so far as the company has worked to configure their manufacturing plants. Because of the inventory constraints surrounding the new F-150 model, the company has not utilized heavy incentives to sell older models like competitors. Despite the lack of incentive usage, the company continues to see strong sales of the premium types such as the EcoBoost F-150, Premium Lariat, King Ranch, and Platinum models. Because of this, the F-150 saw a record setting average transaction price during May 2015. Additionally, the new F-150 is seeing positive consumer reactions when it makes it to the customer lot with a turnover time of approximately 26 days, which is significantly below the industry average of 60 days. I think it is important for Ford to get this product launch right as they are taking the F-series brand in a new direction designed for better fuel mileage. With optimal inventory levels expected later this year, I think it's important to look at the average turn time of the model and the overall health of the US economy. Both of these indicators are indicative of a positive second half of 2015 for the F-150 and Ford as a whole. In May 2015, the US auto consumer continued the shift back to less fuel-efficient vehicles in response to the falling fuel prices. This shift in consumer sentiment will boost sales for the company's higher profit margin vehicles such as the F-150, Explorer, and Expedition. The Mustang saw another impressive month in May, consistent with early 2015 results. Mustang sales were up 55% year-over-year as it continues to build its case to reclaim the title of bestselling muscle car in 2015. This is a title the company has not held since before the 2010 Chevrolet Camaro was introduced. Through May of 2015, Ford has sold an impressive 56,571 Mustangs (up from 36,600 year-to-date May 2014). I believe the sports car segment will continue to see rapid growth as the weather warms and the US economy improves. Ford is certainly losing ground to competitors due to the inventory restrictions. Generally, a lot of times a customer will purchase a vehicle when needed instead of waiting for the newest model. This has been seen in the performance of Chevrolet's Silverado and GMC's Sierras, which combined saw more sales than Ford's F-series in May and June. Furthermore, GM's two full-size trucks together are expected to outsell the F-series this year for the first time in five years. However, this is not the big picture an investor should be seeing when buying shares of Ford. They should be seeing management's plan to shorten the company's normal summer shutdown in order to increase production. This shows me as an investor the new F-150's results are positive and the high end models are selling well, which is creating a lot of optimism around the new model going forward. Once full production capacity is reached, I fully expect Ford to start reversing these disappointing US monthly sales reports. Given this long-term optimism with Ford, I am not worried about the year-over-year decrease reported in May. I continue to be excited about the company's future as the new aluminum bodied F-150 is nearing full production levels, the recent shift in consumer sentiment to higher profit margin vehicles, and the return of the Mustang. With the consumer purchasing more expensive vehicles, it will allow Ford to report stronger top line and bottom line growth. I remain bullish on the US automobile industry and believe Ford has a strong product mix to take advantage of the growing market. I will continue to enjoy the near 4% dividend yield as the company prepares to be successful in the long-term. Source: Ford Will Soon Be Hitting On All Cylinders Disclosure: I am/we are long F.
