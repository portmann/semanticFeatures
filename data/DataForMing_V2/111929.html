Apple iPhone: Why Slightly Bigger Means Much Better - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Leaks suggest new iPhone will be slightly thicker than previous version. Bigger phone allows for big tech upgrades, including Force Touch. When Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) listened to consumers in 2014, the larger screen iPhone 6 was a substantial hit. The smartphone has delivered revenue/earnings records for the technology giant while boosting market share around the globe. This year, the screen size is likely to stay the same, but Apple is reportedly increasing the thickness (depth) of the phone by 0.2 millimeters. This change probably won't be noticeable to the average consumer given the iPhone 6 is 138 mm long and 67 mm wide. However, this small size change will likely make the phone much better, the key to keeping sales strong. As the article above details, one of the key reasons for the size increase is likely the inclusion of Force Touch. This is a key feature that many are looking for, and the hardware for it likely needs an extra 0.1 to 0.2 mm. Force Touch detects contact pressure on the screen's phone, allowing a number of potential uses. Apple already has Force Touch on the MacBook Pro , and it will make the iPhone even better. A few examples taken from the opening article are detailed below. Use Force Touch in camera mode to toggle between photography and video, burst photography, slow mo and time lapse all in real time. There will be many wondering if a bigger iPhone also means a bigger battery. That does not appear to be the case here, which would seem to be a negative given the battery drain issue I cited as key to this year's iPhone. However, it appears that Apple has decided to go the software route here instead of the hardware one. Instead of putting a bigger battery in, the company is reportedly making upgrades in its mobile operating system which will make things run faster and give longer battery life. It seems that Apple also will be making two major upgrades to the hardware in this year's phones. The article cited in my opening states that this year's phones could contain 2GB of RAM (memory). This would be the first major memory update since Apple went to 1GB of RAM on the iPhone 5, according to published specs . Additionally, there's speculation that Apple will go to a 12MP camera, which would be the first increase in megapixels since Apple went to 8MP on the iPhone 4S in 2011. With many public places banning selfie sticks, a major improvement in the camera will be great for those who take selfies. A major upgrade to the hardware of the iPhone comes at a key time for Apple. We are approximately two months away from the launch of Apple's newest iPhone. Not only does the company have a huge upgrade base from initial buyers of the 5S/5C, but we're approaching the two-year anniversary of China Mobile (NYSE: CHL ) sales starting for Apple. According to a recent survey analyzed by CSLA, roughly 60% of Apple's iPhone owners in China are due for an upgrade. With regard to phone buyers over the next 12 months, 87% of current iPhone users plan to buy another iPhone, while 32% of Android users plan to switch. If the recent Wall Street Journal report is true , investors should be very pleased with the newest set of iPhones. WSJ is reporting that Apple has asked its contract manufacturers to produce 85-90 million units of its 4.7 and 5.5 inch phones by year's end. That would be up from the 70-80 million iPhone 6 units initially asked for. If Apple could sell an extra 10-15 million smartphones from the new launch until year's end, you're looking at an extra $6-$10 billion in revenues. Since the iPhone is a higher than corporate average margin product, it also will add a lot to the company's bottom line. One Deutsche Bank analyst recently stated that the iPhone will only show 2% growth in fiscal 2016. I have a hard time seeing that happen if the company can bank an extra 10-15 million smartphones by the end of calendar 2015. It is cautious analyst notes like this one that have held down the stock recently, along with overall market weakness over Greece concerns. The analyst has a $125 price target on Apple, which is now above where the stock is currently but well below the $150 price target median. Apple shares dropped more than $3 on Wednesday, closing at their lowest point since March. We are closely approaching the anniversary of the iPhone 6, so the comparison quarterly numbers are going to start getting much higher. The iPhone is likely to sell around 40% more units in this fiscal year, and selling prices have jumped. As the Deutsche Bank analyst stated, Apple's share of the $400 and up phone market is at 60%, a figure she doesn't believe is sustainable. While there's still room for growth, Apple can't just sit back and expect a larger screen to continue boosting market share. Apple is scheduled to report fiscal Q3 earnings on July 21st, and the average analyst revenue estimate is nearly $49 billion. That's the highest point I've seen, and above the top end of Apple's guidance for $46-$48 billion. The table below shows how estimates have continued to rise over time. After Apple's two big quarterly beats so far this fiscal year, analysts are very optimistic. The current estimate averages represent 30.7% revenue growth and 39.1% EPS growth. Fiscal 2015 is expected to show huge revenue and earnings growth for the company, and the stock has soared as a result. The popularity of the iPhone 6 helped Apple to gain 3 points of market share in calendar Q1 2015, and its strength is a main reason for the struggles we've seen at Samsung (OTC: SSNLF ). But just like we saw a few years ago, when growth slows or stops, investors may start to worry about the stock. With the dividend and buyback becoming less powerful at higher share prices, Apple needs more growth to lure investors. The Watch is helping, but the iPad and iPod are showing massive declines. The PC space is a bit weak currently, so Apple's growth there is not tremendous. In the end, the iPhone is the bread and butter of Apple, so I'm hoping major upgrades to this year's version will continue gains made by the iPhone 6.
