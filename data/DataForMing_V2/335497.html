Is It Too Late To Get Long Netflix Stock? - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Revisiting NFLX after my 2012 bullish call. While such a great bargain is unlikely ever again, the stock is not overvalued. In August of 2012 I made one of my better contrarian calls here on Seeking Alpha. With the stock trading at a split-adjusted price of less than $8 per share, I wrote that " Netflix Stock Is Finally Cheap " and three-and-a-half years later it currently fetches more than $90 per share. Such a great opportunity is unlikely to come again for Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ), but that does not mean investors who missed out should turn the page and move on. After peaking at $133 last year, high growth/high valuation companies have hit a rough patch in 2016. Netflix stock is among those that have come down materially. While still up from its most recent lows ($80), the shares remain about 30% off their highs. So can money still be made going forward? Let's examine that very question. The bull case for Netflix is that they are in the process of replicating what they built in the United States (more than 40 million streaming members that generate over $1 billion of annual profit) across the entire globe as they expand their service nearly everywhere broadband internet access exists today (other than China, by year-end Netflix's service will be available in most countries). If you believe the draw of Netflix will not be limited just to the U.S., valuing the stock requires making two core assumptions - how many subscribers they can ultimately acquire, and how profitable they will be. Such an exercise will tell us if Netflix is a buy in the $90s today or not. Fortunately, the company had provided details on its internal financial model to help us work through these calculations. Netflix is targeting a 40% contribution profit margin on streaming subscribers at scale. Although the international business is still nascent and currently loses money, the U.S. streaming business is getting close to maturing and the company has stuck to that 40% figure. In fact, since I wrote my first Netflix piece in 2012, the company's U.S. streaming contribution profit margin has gone from 17% to 33% in 2015. There is little reason to doubt they can reach their 40% target over the next couple of years. And with that objective successful, mimicking the same result internationally does not really require a big leap of faith. It is important to note that "contribution profit" does not equate to "net profit." Netflix still has corporate general and administrative expenses (about 5-6% of revenue) as well as technology/R&D expenses (about 9-10% of revenue). And income taxes will be owed of course. As a result, once Netflix reaches global scale the company is likely to have net margins of roughly 18%. If we assign a P/E of 15-20x on those earnings, Netflix should trade at a price-to-sales ratio of between 2.7 and 3.6. Let's simplify things and use a target valuation of 3 times annual revenue, which equates to about the same P/E as the S&P 500 today. If Netflix service pricing remains constant at around $10 per month, each subscriber is worth roughly $360. Given the price points for competing offerings, it is not unreasonable to think that Netflix pricing in 2-3 years could be up to $12 per month. That would peg the subscriber valuation at $432 each. So now we have a valuation framework with which to evaluate the current Netflix stock price. The company is expected to end 2016 with roughly 91 million streaming subscribers globally. At $432 per subscriber, Netflix's existing base of customers in just a few quarters would be worth $39.3 billion. That comes out to $90 per share. The good news for Netflix bulls is the company is likely to get far more than 91 million subscribers. By 2020, many industry analysts predict 120 or 130 million as a reasonable number. And by then, who knows where the per-month price might be. Is $14.99 that farfetched? That would increase the previous valuation by another 25%. The bottom line is we have to make multiple assumptions when evaluating Netflix stock today. Personally, I like to take the stance that if I can pay a fair price for the company's existing user base, and therefore get all future growth (in subscriber count, monthly pricing, etc) for free, that is a solid investment bet to make, (provided I believe in Netflix's longevity, which I do). To that end, paying somewhere close to today's prices might make a lot of sense. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
