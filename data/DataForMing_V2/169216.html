The Walt Disney Company's Management Presents at Bank of America Merrill Lynch 2015 Media, Communications & Entertainment Conference - Transcript | Seeking Alpha (Starts Abruptly) Get started with Disney, I’m so excited to have Tom Staggs back at this conference after six years or something like that. It seems you’ve been hiding. So, Tom is in his new role of Chief Operating Officer like beyond. So you’ve been in theme parks, so let’s talk about, what’s happened since you have been in a division. In the five years or so that you’ve been Chairman of Parks and Resorts, the Parks have benefited from projects like Cars Land, which completely transformed California Adventure, the Fantasyland upgrade first time in what like 50 years, MyMagic+ deployment, do projects like little project like Shanghai Disney, Avatar Land’s is well underway, so now that you are seven months into your new role of Chief Operating Officer and the projects are still an integral part of the Disney story you focus is expanded to other parts of Disney’s business, so just let’s kick off with what your key priorities are as COO. Sure. By the way before we get started, I just want to make sure that I introduce Christine McCarthy who is with us today, our new Chief Financial Officer who we are thrilled to have in the role. So, all of you I know will get to know her over time. A decade ago when Bob Iger took over as CEO he laid out a really clear and concise strategy that had three pillars. The first of which was around high quality branded content; the second is geographic expansion; and the third was really leveraging technology across the business and that was a strategy that has served us well and continues to do so. I was CFO during the first part of Bob’s tenure and so worked with him on the implementation of that, but really as you look at it now, my priority as the COO really line-up with those priorities of the company as a whole as dictated by that strategy and I think it will continue to serve us well and so my focus is really on helping to extend that success, especially around leveraging all of our content across our various businesses and around the world and I couldn’t be more excited to have the opportunity to do that. It’s great to come back to the company as a whole and be that much more reminded of this pretty unique echo system that Disney enjoys, which is a real competitive advantage that having the integrated set of businesses that allows us to take these brands, this content, these franchises and leverage them across multiple platforms, multiple businesses, multiple geographies, and so helping to facilitate that, work with Bob in that is key and I can’t, I’m three minutes in, so you can mark that it took me three minutes to mention Star Wars, but Star Wars is a great example of this whole equation because you look at it, we are obviously ramping up to the release of the film in December, but - December 18, but at the same time we are both supporting and benefiting from Star Wars across every part of the company from theme parks to television to games and just last Friday we had Force Friday, which was kind of an amazing event, unprecedented, really fueled by having Maker, for those of you who maybe didn’t see it, it was an event that took place over YouTube over 18 hours in 12 countries in 15 cities and it was a rolling unveil of the product, and so one thing we had just in the U.S. and Canada I think we had a 130,000 people lined up at mid-night to go get the product, but then more broadly than that we’ve just seen Star Wars jump on social media across the board to the most anticipated film of the year. So… What countries did we do? We started in Australia and then went around the globe. I won’t even try to mention all 12, but I’m sure I’ll save a country in doing it, but, and that’s just a good example of taking obviously a very well known and successful franchise in making it significantly more valuable as a part of The Walt Disney Company and so my job is try to make sure I facilitate that leverage and that success more broadly. But just moving along, as CFO you instituted a sharp in focus on cash flow and return on investment and while you were at the Parks you obviously had a period of record investment and growth of course. And in your new role how do you intend to balance the need for further reinvestment as well as return to capital to shareholders? Probably there is no surprise to you or anyone else that our disciplined approach to capital allocation is going to continue. We believe in having a very efficient capital structure. We also want to make sure that we are investing and allocating capital towards projects that will drive both growth and high returns whether that be in our existing businesses or in terms of M&A opportunities that we will see, so that discipline will continue. The good news is that we see a number of opportunities that make those kind of investments. The Shanghai Disney Resort, which you mentioned is a great example of that and so we think that we will be able to invest profitably to give the returns that we all look for and deliver value for shareholders, but also drive growth for the company. But at the same time, we’ve got really strong cash flow and so we also are going to stay disciplined about returning capital to shareholders to maintain that efficient capital structure and make sure the shareholders are seeing returns that way. You know at earnings we announced that next year we are looking to repurchase $6 million to $8 billion worth of stock and you may have noticed that since our announcement in earnings the market is giving us an opportunity to deposit stock at meaningfully lower prices than this is where the stock was trading when we made that announcement and so we’ve taken big advantage of that opportunity. So in little over a month since we reported earnings, we’ve repurchased about $2.4 billion of our stock and that brings our total for the fiscal year of 2015 up to about $5.6 billion in share repurchase, on top of obviously the dividend that we paid and that we’ve continued to grow over time. So, we will continue to pursue investments that drive value and growth, but we also think that we can continue to return capital to shareholders and maintain that structure. But really the ability to quickly turn to buying that much stock that quickly is a nice example of the benefit of having a very strong balance sheet and act as the capital and so that’s something that Christine and I have actually worked on for years and she became Treasurer 15 years ago and it’s something that we’re also committed to going forward. Disney derives a large chunk of its profits from the US PayTV ecosystem, a part of the media sector that continues to confront increased consumption alternatives, most recently evidenced by your own comment, the company’s commentary surrounding ESPN’s relatively small subscriber losses, but as you mentioned the market is giving you a chance to buy back stock you think the markets overreacted? Well there is obviously lot going on in the market beyond the commentary around the multichannel bundle and subs and that sort of thing, so there is a number of factors that play, but having said that I think the short answer to your question is yes, I think the market overreacted. We are confident in our programming services ability to thrive and they are extremely valuable in the context of the existing platforms, but they are also very attractive to any new entrance; and as the market evolves I think we’re going to continue to see new entrants, we are going to continue to see demand for our programming services and they will continue to be an important part of those services actually being successful in their launches, I think that’s supporting. You look at the strength of our brands and our programming and it’s we feel very good about where we sit. ESPN in particular continues to be one of the most important and valuable brands in programming. The ESPN is number one in terms of foresee value, but they also drive the most local ad sales, HD upgrades, broadband subscriptions for our distributors. Importantly also ESPN has the broadest and deepest collection of live sports and we know how important live sports are to viewership and viewer patterns. And this last weekend was a great reminder of that, both in terms of the high ratings we saw with college football, over the weekend, but also on the U.S. Open. In fact Tuesday night quarter-final match, which was obviously a good match of Venus and Serena Williams turned out to be the second most, second-highest rating that ESPN has seen for a tennis match for ever and so live sports here to say is a huge asset for ESPN, but I think what’s perhaps most interesting is the extent to which we are seeing the viewership across multiple platforms. And I think ESPN has uniquely built a true multiplatform programming brand and that extends from obviously linear TV, but to ESPN.com and watch ESPN and other mobile apps, and so for this weekend there were ESPN aired 48 college football match ups just this last weekend. Now most of those were only available through Watch ESPN and the viewership across our digital platforms for the weekend was actually up over 60% for that weekend and the number of devices accessing watch ESPN was up by more than 50%. So, we continue to see viewership across those platforms grow and it wouldn’t surprise you to know that for people who are multiplatform users they are spending the most time also a linear TV, like people that access across multiple platforms can be as much as fourfold more time watching television. So, one reinforces the other and I think people sometimes think of this is more of a zero sum game then I think it’s appropriate. So, we are increasingly monetizing across those platforms and I think those opportunities will grow especially as things like selling across impressions and dynamic added assertion as those capabilities improve, but I think I’m excited about how our programming services are positioned especially with new entrance, but I think just as importantly we continue to believe in the value and the appeal of the multichannel bundle and that value and appeal is going to continue for some time and I think that’s important. Look, we also know that as the market evolves here again and these platforms have access to more technologies there are and will continue to be opportunities to improve the value proposition of the bundle and everything from user interface to navigation to search access the programming and it’s incumbent upon us and distributors to make sure that we are taking advantage of this opportunity to improve that user experience, no question, but the bundle shouldn’t be viewed as a static product. It is going to continue to evolve and it is going to continue, and we’re going to continue to reinforce the value of that bundle over time. So, I think that that really coupled with sort of what we see in the new platform makes us feel like we are very well-positioned. Well on the one hand the growth of the [indiscernible] players kind of underscores the fact that high quality programming is more in demand than ever and our ability to monetize our programming is greater than ever. So that’s good news, but I do think it’s important that to recognize that this market is fluid and our approach to the market is going to be fluid as well. And so we want to make decisions that optimize the value of our programming services and our content as a whole and so we’re going to look at it that way. For example you know, could be that to the optimum place for full season stacks of current programming is within our services through the multichannel bundle. At the same time, we will look to make sure that we’re making that sort of availability there that’s optimal, while also managing and supporting the value of our library through [indiscernible] and other distributors and new entrance in the marketplace, and so we want to take a holistic view of this to make sure that we are managing for the long term value of all this content and programming and that’s what we will do. And how does your content investment strategy need to evolve to ensure future growth in this part of your business? Well I feel like the stands that we’ve taken, the position we’ve taken is the right one in the overall position. I mentioned earlier that the first pillar of the strategy Bob laid out was about high-quality branded content and that is for us the centerpiece of what we do and it’s going to continue to be that way. Disney Channel is a great example where we continue to invest in program and that we leverage throughout the world. So Disney Channel’s reaches has continued to grow and that obviously helps the brand, helps our other businesses, but also helps us drive value from that content. It’s not all created here by the way, good half or more of that content is created locally at those Disney Channels around the world, but increasingly that ecosystem is made more robust by the investments making in branded programming. You see it also in the content that we are investing in at ABC, we are excited about the new fall schedule much of which is produced at ABC Studios and at ABC Family. And then when I - when we think about ESPN, again I reiterate the breadth and depth of our sports rights at ESPN is a tremendous asset, many of these rights go out as far as past 2030 and so our ability to offer that breadth of content for that period of time really positions us well to take advantage of the conversation we just said earlier, the opportunity in new platforms, the reach of multichannel, but also the ability to continue to reinforce the core programming service that we all know as ESPN and so I feel good about it, we will continue on the same. Just one more question on this topic and then we’ll move on to the divisions, but would you go over the topic if needed? Well look as I mentioned, we continue to believe in the bundle and we think and we will continue to look at ways to enhance the value of that. So, in the foreseeable future I don’t see over the top a simple, now everybody is over the top as being an outcome that’s going to happen. To the extent that there is opportunities to broaden reach through going over the top either in concert with the existing model or because the model shifts, I feel just as good about the brands and the program that we have to make sure that we can make that pivot if the need is there, but I don’t see that soon. Right. Okay, and so let’s get into the divisions and start with your old snooping grounds the Theme Parks, you are less than a year away from the Spring 2016 opening of Shanghai Disney can you give us an update on the progress and I guess given like the last couple of weeks in the market reactions, could you talk about how the concerns about the health of the Chinese economy, has that affected you if at all? Sure let’s start with the Park and Resort itself. I’m smiling because every time I think about it, I get more excited. The progress is good, as it takes more and more share occasionally I just got, last night just got a most recent aerial photo of the development and you can really see that one that is taking, more importantly just in July we did a creative unveil of what we’re doing at the development including the six different lands that will be featured in the park and it was incredibly well-received, you know this, virtually every aspect of this park has been either designed or conceived or re-imagined specifically for this market and so we’ve said it a number of times there is going to be a product that is absolutely authentically Disney, but it’s distinctly Chinese and so it’s exciting for us in that context. And in terms of China, you know the number one, we believe in this opportunity both near-term and long-term, but it is important to know that we’re making this investment as a long-term investment and when we build a park, we build it to last, it is meant to be there for decades to come for generations to come to enjoy and that will be the case and I’ve, since I’ve set myself up what a great way to plug, but right now the 60th anniversary is going on for Disneyland, but it is also good illustration of how we think about these parks. The 60th anniversary is going fantastically well, it has been very successful but it is also proving that Disneyland is more relevant today than ever before. And so that’s how we think about what we’re building in China, somebody, some future generation to sit here at this stage to maybe they will just be doing this. But to say 60 years since Shanghai Disney Resort has become a part of the culture in a way that it is the aspirational visit, it is the thing that people talk about, the thing that people want to share with their children so that is what we are shooting for in China. And first of all that is what we go going to do in China and I think the opportunity is great. Right. But those, kind of the near-term stuff in China do you think, does that affect any way you think about next year… It hasn’t impacted our enthusiasm for the project at all. I watched the same things that you watch in China, it actually signs the consumer spending continues to be relatively strong there and so within three hours travel of Shanghai Disney Resort when you open there will be 330 million income qualified potential guests that, it looks good. But we’re hearing increasingly more about Theme Park development in and around Mainland China such as Polar Ocean Park in Shanghai; Universal, Beijing can you give us your assessment of the competitive landscape. You know the competition has been a reality in this business since Walt first kind of invented with Disneyland, because he did reinvent an industry and there has been market entrants and competition since then and I think that would be the case in China. I think the Shanghai Disney Resort is going to be a big catalyst for tourism in that area and across China as a whole and they will inevitably be new market entrants. And here with the Shanghai Disney Resort, we plan to compete the same way we do here and that is the that is that we think the quality of our product, the service that our customers provide and it will - and obviously the strength of our brand and the way that we support it throughout our different businesses will allow us to compete successfully there as it has here. So… I could too, but I don’t have you all day, but what is your plan for additional what are you thinking about in terms of additional gate opening and possibly even additional parks given the size of the country. We actually said and pointed out that the property around Shanghai Disney Resort gives us enough space for that to be the largest destination we have potentially outside of the United States. And so we think there are real opportunities to continue to develop there and in fact we already announced preopening and expansion that will happen for the opening. So that will continue, we will continue to see opportunities in Shanghai. We are also going to continue to see opportunities I believe in Hong Kong to continue to develop that property and that business. And overtime I think it’s very possible that we might see another location in China. So China is a big opportunity. And just to clarify, this would be the biggest part apps. I think what you said in the past was this business could be the second biggest pop. Okay. So let’s come back to the U.S. growth strategy. You’ve just announced two new Star Wars wins, one at Disney’s Hollywood Studios, one in California Disneyland. Can you give us a sense of the timing of these two wins? We probably weren’t facing that. When we announced the acquisition of Lucas, if you heard a roar, it probably was going to loud from the house of imagineering because it is that people who immediately excited and energized by the notion that we could put Star Wars into theme parks. This is where we are looking at making sure that Star Wars touches pretty much every aspect of the company. And so we are really excited about this team of developments. So they’re going to be better. These will each be represent the biggest single themed development that we’ve undertaken and so that’s how important Star Wars business, how big the opportunity is for us. And for those who didn’t see the news coming out of D23, one of the things that people really want to be able to do is [indiscernible]. Yes, people will build the flood of money but there is also going to be a number of other tractions. And just importantly, this will be I think perhaps the most immersive land we build because we want people to feel like they’ve stepped into the world of Star Wars. And so that’s really sparked our imaginations and it’s got people fired up. Yes, there will be an [indiscernible] that’s the other question we get on the phone. So that’s exciting. And we are doing it both at Anaheim and Walt Disney World and I am pleased to announce that we will construction on both in 2016. Opening is not yet ready to be announced. Bob and I are saying really, really soon and other people are saying this takes a while to build. So we are negotiating the opening right now. And then in Orlando, you’ve got a game changing investment in Animal Kingdom with AVATAR land. Can you talk about the progress there and should we think about this the way Cars Land transform California Adventure? Yeah, I think that is a good anapathology. So the center piece of the transmission is absolutely the AVATAR development which is called Pandora - The world of AVATAR, that’s the official name of the land that we are building in. And not long ago, Jim Cameron and John Landau, his partner Bob Iger and I went on and erode the similar to – it gave us a taste of the attraction which is to be able to fly on in and around Pandora. Both the process that you recognize in the first zone but we’re also going to take it to some places that no longer become familiar once you see the film is to come and it’s going to be really one of the most spectacular attractions that were built. But also we’re going to make mountains float because you have to do that on Pandora, so why wouldn’t we do it in Orlando – and the – it was quite an engineering feet. So that 10 acre land there is another mature attraction which is a water-based ride that takes you into the forest of Pandora. So we’re going to again try to make sure we immerse you in that world in a way that is really compelling. But we’ve also got a number of other things going around Animal Kingdom. We’ve got a new night time spectacular called Rivers of Light which will take place on a lake there in Animal Kingdom and that I think will be just this breath taking and ground breaking as where the color was for California Adventure and that will anchor the evening, but another big anchor traction will be that we’re going to convert the really hugely popular Kilimanjaro Safaris to be able to operate at night, introduction of some different animal species and that I think is going to be really popular to. So we will add entertainment around the park, so initially it’s a full day experience. So whereas California Adventure was already operating on a full day basis, this allows us to take Animal Kingdom which as you know close relatively early will now go to a full day experience which obviously instantaneously add to capacity at the same point of time today, so a big opportunity for us. And then you have some obvious you could incorporate to Marvel, Pixar and a number of properties. What else you’re working on? What else you will be thinking there? We talked about this Disney Ecosystem, the unbelievably rich library of content we have but also the pipeline of new content for us means that there is endless opportunity for us to keep things fresh to monetize and leverage franchises around the whole company and Parks is a great example. So we talked about Star Wars and by the way there is more Star Wars going as you expect some to correspond with the recent film. My favorite one I think is going to be Hyperspace Mountain, which is Star Wars overlay of Space Mountain which is going to be really fun. But we’re also doing a number of other things to activate Star Wars in anticipation of the new lands coming on. You mentioned Marvel, there we’ve currently got the Iron Man experience going being built in Hong Kong opening in 2017 and we are actually at work on a couple of other opportunities for Marvel which we are not yet ready to announce but you will see more Marvel in the Parks over time. There are some restrictions as you know in Florida with the rights that existed prior to our acquisition but we are excited about that. But then you go across the board, we got a land going in at the studios in Florida that will be a companion to the Star Wars development, so that park also... That should be a little bit before Star Wars opened, but that too allows us a transformation of that park which really supports the multiday ticketing strategy and per cap growth – tennis growth plan that we have for Florida. So that’s a big deal as well. Toy Street of course is in development right now which will continue to support that franchise. We’ve got more going on with Frozen in terms of the parks, it’s already in the parks around the world, but we got an attraction opening in 2017 with Frozen. And [indiscernible] (28:13) is next summer, we’ve got a traction that’s under development for Tokyo. So this ability to sort of tap into this pipeline and create attraction the people are really going to want to see there is a fresh appeal to a broad array of people. It’s a real strength for us. Your returns have been great for the last few years but new attractions have continued to drive attendance? Is there anything else? Well, it’s a real balance I think. At the end of the day it’s all in service of that overall guest experience and that’s really what sets this parks. We are known for the totality of the guest experience. That’s really what drove the MyMagic+ development in Florida. We are looking at leveraging those ideas and technologies even if it’s not the specific form factor in other parks around the world. And we’ve seen in the impact of that in terms of material uptick in reported guest satisfaction, access to attractions, people are getting to spend more time dealing what they wanted to do, distress the vacation. So those incremental investments we can make in the guest experience overall will continue to be a part of the equation and again that all adds up to supporting that the dual growth of attendance, dual goals of attendance growth. What we are seeing in Hong Kong is really driven by sort of some macro factors that most of which I think are temporary. There has been some social unrest that got issues, these are restriction changes, there has been some currency change, a number of things going on there that have impacted Hong Kong broadly but we remain optimistic and confident in Hong Kong overtime. And so we continue to worth mention the Iron Man experience we are putting in, we’ve got a hotel that is under construction there and it’s going to be great. And so we will see continued growth in Hong Kong over time once we get past, but I think there is some temporary disruptions in terms of the marketplace. [indiscernible] let’s move on to some of the other division. So on home entertainment, I mean Star Wars is obviously the biggest movie probably ever but – and the anticipation or expectation, but can you – there is many generations that weren’t even alive when the last one came out. So what are you doing do generate excitement for the younger generation? Well, I see two things on that. Number one, we are very excited about Episode 7 and we are not going to speculate how big it will be or won’t be. What’s important to know that was, Episode 7 is a part of a broader long term strategy with the Star Wars franchise. So coming after Episode 7 of course we talked Rogue One which will come after that which is a separate standalone piece and then you get to Episode 8, another standalone piece and Episode 9. So this is a long pipeline. So even more important than the number that comes out with Episode 7 is the work that we’re doing around the franchise as a whole. We view this as a long term evergreen franchise that will impact our business around the world and around the entire company. I think that’s the important way to think about Star Wars. But I talked about the Global Unboxing Event that we had and the degree to which make or help us to really leverage debt, but it also allowed us to reach a new generation of consumers in a very authentic and effective way. So that’s been great. But as we look at the response to the franchise, it’s been very broad based. When you look at the trailer came out and set a record for close to 90 million views in the first 24 hours on YouTube and that’s not just the folks like me that grew up on the original part of the franchise. And also we are confident that we are building the franchise and as important to making a film in Episode 7 that will appeal absolutely to the folks that know and love Star Wars but it will the folks that are going to be Star Wars entrant to that point as well. Yes. And China hasn’t had it theatrically. There has been some Star Wars in China and yes, it’s a bit of wildcard but at the same time I think it’s going to be some of the China will embrace in a big way and by the way there will be Star Wars elements coming in Shanghai Disney Resort. We are confident that franchise is going to be meaningful there. Okay. You generated over $1.4 billion in domestic box office this year compared to last year of roughly $1.2 billion at this time in an extremely competitive market. So the biggest drivers have been the mix of franchises like Avengers - Age of Ultron but you’ve also had some originals like Inside Out from Pixar. How do you strike the right balance between investing in non-franchises and the need to develop new franchises? Well, I think you said it exactly right which is that is a balance and the franchises that we have really afford us the opportunity to be consistently in the marketplace with properties that are known and loved, and that therefore have – it’s not that there is a degree of success built in because we never take that for granted but at the same time it does give them a leg up in terms of the success and the returns that we see on those investments and that’s important [indiscernible]. But we also know this is important both from the standpoint of our creative organization but also the vibrancy of our pipeline and our overall system that there are new story lines and new titles going in. The huge success of inside out coming at Pixar this summer is a fantastic example of that. But also as we look at it, the word sequel tends to be used broadly, take Marvel as an example, there are clearly Marvel films Age of Ultron which was clearly a sequel to the First Avengers movie and yet at the same time within the Marvel Universe we can explore other characters and storylines like Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man. There aren’t so much sequel as they are, new ways to explore that franchise and those two of them well received. And with 8,000 characters in Marvel Universe, there is a whole lot of room for us to build that and port that way. So as you said this is about having a balance between the existing IP and the powerful sequels that can come from that, and then the new IP. Frozen, now we all have lived with and if you have children, I could just [indiscernible] you might be angry with me for that because it’s been ahead for two years but the fact is that was a new franchise and now it is something that’s throughout the company. And so again we know that the strength of our creative organization allows us to over time add those franchise to the library and therefore create even more than underpinning to that first powerful pillar that Bob laid out which is it’s branded content that we can leverage across the company. Okay. We have three more divisions in five minutes. So moving on to Media Networks, can you talk a little bit, there is so much going on in the market between measurement, currency, technology, could you talk a little bit about how the upfront [indiscernible] how different was it this year and what are you seeing in the current marketplace. We were pleased with the upfront. Now, we went-in in a good position because we are the only network that had ratings increases for the year so that help some. We also have strong schedule and advertisers responded well to it. So we came away with industry leading price increases. Volume was down a little bit, there is no question that advertisers will be looking for a little bit more flexibility in the equation. And I think that’s fine but we are pleased there. No, take for example, the ESPN on the other hand both CPMs and volumes were up. And so that was an even more robust upfront market, but I think that there is some effort to look for more flexibility, people are looking for the opportunity to do something multi-platform, they’re looking the ability to make more decisions as they go along. So that probably increases the import to a certain extent the scatter market. And we are little bit in scatter market right now, it’s actually very helpful and broad based. And so we are liking the fact that we both set a nice level in terms of the CPMs but also have the inventory to lean into that marketplace perhaps on a different basis. And with the strong program that we have, we feel quite good about it. Look, we are just coming out of summer and into the fall season. So either you or I should make too much out of the trends. I would say that the healthy trends board well for what we’re going to see for a scatter market as we get into the fall season and I’m feeling optimistic about that. Okay. So let’s move on to consumer products. Aside from Star Wars which obviously is a really good this year, what is the material driver of consumer products performance over the next 12 months to 24 months? Well, I think the most important thing about consumer products is that, that is now underpinned by the 11 franchise that we have that account for more than $1 billion in sales at retail and so it is broad based. And the broad based strength of our consumer products business is a critical component. But we also know that a great success with Age of Ultron, so that gives us some momentum going into the year. We are very excited about the new Captain America civil work. Also, Marvel to be strong for us. Please got a couple of Pixar films next year. So we’re hopeful to see some real strength on to the Pixar. The Dinosaur is one of the fall and then we’ve got [indiscernible] as I mentioned in the summer. And then we also see continued strength in frozen and that clearly established its place in the firm if you will and I think that’s going to continue to be an important piece of consumer products results. So broad based looking good. To your 11 franchises, okay, one last question, which is interactive. Disney Interactive which has gaming operations as well as number of busy [indiscernible] websites has been profitable for many years. At the end of August 30, you released an infinity to be 1.0 with Star Wars characters, can you give us any based on outlines from… [indiscernible] was unprofitable but they’ve done a nice job in terms of rationalizing the business and really focusing in on the products entitles that can make a difference in the quality of the products. Infinity 3.0 just came out and that’s a good example. It’s gotten highest ratings ever for design or active game according to Metacritic. I think it sets us up well. It’s just out of the box, so it us up well for the holiday season. There is actually a place that comes with the release of Star Wars that will underpin that. And then also in the – about partnering and licensing where there is leverage. So a really important game I think will be battlefront which I think is coming out in November. And it’s that too Star Wars battle front. It’s nice because we got infinity which tends to appeal to that the younger players and then battle front which is really a core gamer title, nice complement. EA has put out some pretty aggressive sales figures for that and so we are very optimistic there. So I think they are on the right path and I think that they will go on to a more consistent and attractive contributor to profits. Great for all the time. Thank you so much. Thanks, my pleasure. We will see you again. Thank you. Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.
