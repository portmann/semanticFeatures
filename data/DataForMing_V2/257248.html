Sifting The Apple Rumors: A New 4-Inch iPhone - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Rumors indicate that Apple plans to introduce a new iPhone model with a 4-inch diagonal screen similar in size to the current iPhone 5s. One poll has found that about 20% of respondents prefer the 4-inch screen size. Numerous rumors are surfacing of a new iPhone, often referred to as the 6c, with a 4-inch diagonal screen that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) will introduce to replace the venerable iPhone 5s. Such a phone would continue the process Apple started with iPhone 6 of diversifying the newest generation iPhone with a variety of screen sizes and capabilities. Such a phone would undoubtedly find a market, and add to Apple's top and bottom lines. In one of my first articles for Seeking Alpha I advocated that Apple diversify the iPhone product line by building more than one screen size, and I pointed to the crying need for a ~5-inch screen iPhone. I felt that just offering what Apple believed to be the "best" phone, along with past generation models did not provide consumers with sufficient choice. At the time, the suggestion met with considerable scorn from the fan base. Now, more than two years later, consumers do have choice between 3 screen sizes, including the "phablet" size of the 6 Plus and 6s Plus. Just offering that amount of choice worked wonders for iPhone sales and the December 2014 quarter broke records with 74.47 million unit sales. Could Apple go even further in diversifying its iPhone product line? I think so. For instance, the choice currently available for a 4-inch screen, the iPhone 5s, while an excellent phone, lacks Apple Pay. Consumers who want Apple Pay and a 4-inch screen are forced to make a difficult choice. In my concept of diversification, it's important to offer variety in form factor and price point that is also new. In other words, if Apple offers a new 4-inch iPhone model, it should be part of the new generation iPhone, so that there would be three rather than two models. The phones would have similar styling and construction and would offer a common suite of capabilities, such as Apple Pay. The current set of rumors are kind of at odds with this concept. Instead, the early rumors, well summarized by MacRumors , harken back to the iPhone 5c, even purporting to show a plastic backed 6c shown above. The rumors have evolved away from a plastic iPhone, and there is a element of advocacy in the rumors. Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster conducted a poll in which 20% of respondents indicated a preference for a 4-inch iPhone. Munster rumor-mongered about an Apple television for many years to no avail, but will probably have better luck with the 4-inch iPhone. He believes that the new phone will replace the outgoing iPhone 5s and feature Apple Pay. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has weighed in on the subject. He believes the new 4-inch iPhone will feature a metal body, Apple Pay, and the A9 processor from the current generation iPhone 6s. Kuo also thinks the new phone could start shipping in early 2016, while Munster thinks its more likely to come out with the rest of the new iPhone lineup in the fall of 2016. This is partly an expression of my own advocacy position, but I really believe the new 4-inch iPhone deserves to be a full-fledged member of the current lineup of iPhones. For that reason, I agree with Munster that the phone will be introduced with the iPhone 7 generation. In fact, I don't think the phone will be called the 6c, but rather designated as part of the 7 lineup. Perhaps "7c", or to distance it from the plastic iPhone, "7 mini". Use of the A9 processor would be overkill for a phone with a screen resolution of 1136 x 640 pixels. As documented by Anandtech , the A9 received considerably beefed up graphics processing. Probably, Apple will go with the A8 processor in order to minimize cost. However, Apple Pay and NFC radio capability are a must. In keeping with the 7 generation, the iPhone 7 mini will have an comparable case and choice of colors along with its bigger siblings. However, the phone will be less expensive by virtue of using the older A8 processor and smaller screens. This allows Apple to take advantage of learning curve cost reductions for the A8 processor and screen. Learning curve is especially important for semiconductor processing. As processes become more mature with each succeeding year, foundries such as TSMC (NYSE: TSM ) reduce the per wafer cost they charge their customers. Foundries can do this because part of the maturation process is that wafer yields improve considerably. This is why older processes, such as TSMC's 28 nm process continue to be very lucrative and popular. They are considerably less expensive than leading edge processes such as the 16 nm FinFET process that TSMC uses for the A9 and A9X. Learning curve also applies to yield in display screen fabrication, which also involves sophisticated semiconductor processing. How much cost reduction is afforded is probably a closely guarded secret between Apple and its suppliers, but Gene Munster estimates that the new 4-inch phone could be priced at $450 without contract. Kuo estimated the price range to be $400-$500. With Apple's typical gross margin of 40%, that would put the cost to Apple of the phone at about $270. These are, of course, very ball park estimates. Despite the poll results, Munster believes the 4-inch iPhone will have little impact on sales. He believes that the 20% who say they want a 4-inch screen will eventually be won over to the larger screen size. I disagree. Customers have had more than a year to get used to the larger screens. They've had a chance to view the larger phones in stores, have handled them, and apparently decided that the larger sizes were not for them. The 20% represent an important upgrade market that Apple can't afford to ignore. And why should they? Hopefully, Apple management have moved away from trying to impose on consumers Apple's notion of what's best in a smart phone screen size. Kuo has estimated that the 4-inch iPhone could make up 8-9% of total unit sales, which seems to be about right. Will Apple's margins suffer as a result of selling the less expensive 4-inch iPhone? I really doubt that Apple would sell any iPhone that hurt its margins significantly. Apple simply doesn't pursue revenue growth for the sake of growth if it hurts margins. And there's every reason to believe that costs for the 4-inch iPhone would be significantly less. I expect the new 4-inch iPhone to produce an incremental 8-9% y/y unit sales increase as it wins over older iPhone customers and other non-iPhone users when introduced in the fall of 2016, with a similar increase in gross profit. I remain long Apple and consider it a buy. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information. We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.
