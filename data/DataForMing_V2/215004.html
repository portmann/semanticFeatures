ETF Hub Oct 24 2015, 15:16 ET | About: Facebook (FB) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor "With over 1.5 billion searches per day and over 2 trillion posts in our index, search is an important, long-term effort at Facebook (NASDAQ: FB )," the social networking giant states while unveiling a major overhaul of its search engine. All Facebook posts can now be accessed via keyword-based searches, provided a post is accessible to a user based on its privacy settings. Personalized search suggestions are also provided. In addition to allowing users to more quickly find older posts, photos, and videos from themselves and friends, Facebook's revamped search engine gives it the potential to act as an alternative to Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) for real-time news search. A search for "World Series" turns up related trending topics, relevant posts from friends, and posts from Sports Illustrated, the NYT, NBC News, and other media sources. The overhaul comes amid reports Facebook is prepping Notify , an app that manages and sends out push notifications from news sources and other publishers. The update also raises the possibility of public Facebook posts being indexed by and integrated with Google, Bing, and other search engines. Twitter already has integration deals with Google and Bing. For now, Facebook reiterates it's not focused on monetizing search for the time being; keyword-based search ads are a natural fit for the new search engine. A Bing integration deal was ended last year . I might get some criticism but Facebook with $300 Billion in Market Cap $10 Billion in Cash and BIG money subsidiaries like Instagram and Facebook Messenger,it should be acquiring SnapChat. 2 trillion posts about bowel movements, funny cats, breakups, and cute kids making you laugh. Not sure the usefulness of fb posts for searching, unless it's for tracking people down.
