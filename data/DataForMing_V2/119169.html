Apple Earnings Preview - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple is set to announce Q3 earnings on Tuesday, July 21. We expect Apple to beat on the top-line, but believe analysts are too bullish on EPS. We believe Apple is poised to grow unit market shares across its brands. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is set to announce Q3 earnings on Tuesday, July 21, after the close. The Street is looking for EPS of $1.79 on revenues of $49.26 billion for the quarter. We are modeling for EPS of $1.77 on revenues of $49.31 billion for the quarter, and believe an attractive valuation coupled with promising further growth opportunities constitute AAPL as a buy heading into earnings. Q2 2015 saw positive revenue growth in all geographic segments aside from Japan, which saw revenues decline 15% YoY. A successful iPhone 6 launch was largely responsible for these gains across all geographic segments, coupled with solid growth in Apple TV and Beats revenue. Temporarily ignoring Apple Watch sales, we do not believe YoY sales growth in Americas, Europe, or Japan will be dramatically changed from Q2 to Q3, seeing as we believe the June quarter's new products, aside from Apple Watch, will not have a material effect on topline. We are then modeling for 19% YoY growth in Americas, 12% YoY growth in China, and a 15% YoY decline in Japan. It is important to note that these YoY growth figures are applied to Q3 2014's reported figures, when Apple recognized Retail sales as a separate segment. According to our analysis of Retail reconciliation in Q1 and Q2 2015, roughly 70% of Retail sales were from the Americas, while 15% came from Europe, 10% from China, 1% from Japan, and 4% from APAC. We reconcile for this in our model by conservatively assuming Retail sales are flat YoY and applying these percent contributions on top of our organic growth. We are modeling for China and APAC's growth to accelerate in Q3. There have been recent concerns over China's slowing economy and struggling stock market. Despite these concerns, China saw stable economic growth in Q2, with GDP growing 7% YoY , which was actually above estimates. More importantly, national-per-capita disposable income grew 9% YoY over the first 6 months of 2015 (7.6% inflationary adjusted). Urban residents' per-capita disposable income grew 8.1% YoY in that same time frame. These figures are a continued representation of a growing global middle-class, and Apple should continue to benefit from this uptick in income. All in all, we are very comfortable modeling 80% YoY topline growth in China. This represents an increase from the 71% YoY topline growth in Q2. We believe we will see a sequential increase in iPhone 6 sales in China, due to continued increases in disposable income. These assumptions lead us to a topline projection of $47.29 billion. We then account for Apple Watch sales by projecting 4 million Apple Watch unit sales for the June quarter (the midpoint of several analyst projections ). This projection multiplied by an average sales price of $505 gives us an additional $2.02 billion in inorganic topline growth for Apple. We arrive at a net sales projection for the quarter of $49.31 million. We believe margins will fall near the high end of guidance, and are modeling for 39.5% gross margin, opex of $5.65 billion, and a 26.3% tax-rate. We are calling for 5.6 billion shares outstanding for the quarter, which leads us to EPS of $1.77 for the quarter. Despite this earnings miss, we believe Apple is well-positioned to pop following earnings and continue to create value for shareholders. Apple's unit smartphone share is roughly 20% , and smartphone profit share is 92%. iPhones' list price is just about 3.5x Androids' list price. We believe this emphasizes Apple's brand power, while also reiterating Apple's room for further global smartphone market penetration and revenue growth. Likewise, Apple's unit PC market share is roughly 6%, and PC profit share is over 50%. We believe this again emphasizes Apple's brand power, while also reiterating Apple's room for further PC market penetration and revenue growth. By comparison, Nokia (NYSE: NOK ) had about 67% smartphone profit share 8 years ago. Just 3 years ago, Apple's profit share was equal with Samsung's profit share. Smartphone profit share changes rather quickly and dramatically. Moreover, the largely untapped African smartphone market is showing signs of promising growth . This could be an avenue for expansionary growth for Apple in the future, and adoption therein could follow a China-like trajectory. Apple is also relatively cheap, trading at 13x on forward earnings on growth expectations of 7.60%. Moreover, the company sports a 5-year PEG of 0.94 . We are bullish on Apple heading into earnings despite the recent bounce-back following China slowdown concerns, and are projecting the company to report better-than-expected net sales for the quarter.
