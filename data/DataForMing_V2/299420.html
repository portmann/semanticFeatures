Einhorn Shorted Amazon - You Shouldn't - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. No, you shouldn't short Amazon. If anything, you might want to consider buying it, provided you hedge to limit your downside risk. Amazon currently has the highest calculated potential return of any security in Portfolio Armor's universe. We describe how potential returns are calculated and show next highest-ranked names. We also show an optimal collar hedge for Amazon for an investor who would like a shot at capturing its potential return while limiting his downside risk to 15%. Jeff Bezos (pictured below, accompanying his newly freed Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian back from Iran - image via NBC Nightly News ) had a better 2015 than value investor David Einhorn did. Shares of Bezos's Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) were up about 120% on the year. Meanwhile, Greenlight Capital, the hedge fund run by David Einhorn (pictured below - image via Institutional Investor ) posted losses of 20.2% last year, according to Institutional Investor's Alpha , punctuated by losers such as SunEdison (NYSE: SUNE ) which was down about 90% on the year. Now, Institutional Investor's Alpha reports that Einhorn's Greenlight has been short Amazon, along with Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ), as of last quarter. Should you short Amazon too? We think not. On the contrary, we'd suggest you'd be better off being long Amazon, provided you are hedged. We discuss why and provide an optimal collar hedge for it below. First, though, let's consider the bearish case for Amazon. Greenlight's most recent shareholder letter, reprinted at ValueWalk , doesn't give a short thesis for Amazon; it just notes that it and Netflix were "powerful momentum plays". Presumably though, as a value investor, Einhorn is offended by Amazon's high valuation. And indeed, according to the valuation metrics below (data via Fidelity), the stock does look pricey. Price/Sales Amazon: 2.8; Industry Average: 3.5. These numbers all look high, and, except for Price/Sales, they are all well above the Internet retail industry average, which look high to begin with. The metric a bearish value investor might focus on most here is the PEG ratio, since it takes growth into account, and even an investor as growth-oriented as Jim Cramer prefers stocks with PEG ratios below 2. The main reason we're bullish on Amazon is that it's currently Portfolio Armor's highest-ranked name when ranked by potential return (and has been one of its highest-ranked names since August;as you can see here , it appeared in a hedged portfolio created on August 11th). Potential return, in our terminology, is a bullish estimate of how a security will perform over the next six months. Because our universe includes every security with options traded on it in the US, including stocks as well as exchange-traded products such as ETFs, we can't use fundamental metrics such as the ones we listed for Amazon above to rank securities, since they don't apply to every security (such as a fixed income ETF). Instead, after using two screens to eliminate the least promising securities, we use price action as well as option market sentiment to calculate potential returns. Essentially, we start with the assumption that a security's return over the next six months will begin to revert to its long term mean six-month return. Then, we test that assumption by looking at the prices of options on the security that expire in approximately six months. That test of option market sentiment gives a forward-looking element, because it represents the views of option market participants on where the underlying security is likely to be several months out. We backtested this method by running our analysis every trading day from 1/2/2003 to 10/31/2013 and then looking at the actual returns of the securities with the highest potential returns on our daily scans over the next six months. Over that 11-year period, we conducted 25,412 comparisons of our calculated potential returns to actual returns, an average of 9.4 top-ranked securities each trading day. The average potential return we calculated was 22.4%. The average actual return over the next six months, unhedged, was 6.84%. Since the average actual return was 0.3x the average potential return, we use that 0.3x multiple to derive expected returns from our potential returns. While a potential return represents a bullish upside, an expected return is the more likely result. Our current potential return for Amazon is 30%. To give an idea of the sort of names that currently score highly according to this method, these were the top five names in our system as of Friday. Note that our site is agnostic about whether a security is a stock, an ETF, or even a leveraged inverse ETF.Although the top-5 names have usually been stocks, as you can see below, two are leveraged bets against China stocks and oil, respectively. Other reasons to be bullish on Amazon are the company's history of executing in online retail - is there anyone reading this article who hasn't ordered from Amazon? - and its track record of successfully entering new businesses, for example, cloud computing with Amazon Web Services . It seems harder, at this point, to come up with a bearish thesis. Yes, Amazon is a pricey stock, but that's not new, as the 5 year average P/E shows, so it's not something one would expect to tank the stock. The most likely catalysts for a significant pullback in Amazon shares would be a continuation of the recent stock market correction, or disappointing quarterly numbers (the company is expected to release its fourth quarter and annual numbers after the close on January 28th). We're going to use Portfolio Armor's iOS app to find an optimal collar to hedge Amazon below. Whether you run the calculations yourself, or use the app, two pieces of information you'll need to supply (in addition to the number of shares you're looking to hedge) are your "cap" and your "threshold". "Cap" refers to the maximum upside you are willing to limit yourself to if the underlying security appreciates significantly. A logical starting point for the cap is your estimate of how the security will perform over the time period of the hedge. Since our site calculated a potential return of 30% for Amazon over the next several months, we'll use that as the cap. All else equal though, the lower the cap, the less expensive it will be to hedge. The other term, "threshold," refers to the maximum decline you are willing to risk. This will vary depending on your risk tolerance. For the purposes of the example below, we've used a threshold of 15%. If you are more risk averse, you could use a smaller threshold, and you are less risk averse, you could use a larger one. All else equal though, the higher the threshold, the cheaper it will be to hedge. As of Friday's close, this was the optimal collar to hedge 100 shares of AMZN against a >15% drop over the next several months, while not capping an investor's upside by less than 30%: As you can see in the first part of the optimal collar above, the cost of the put leg was $3,460, or 5.8% as a percentage of position value. But if you look at the second part of the collar below, you'll see the income generated by selling the call leg was $755, or 1.27% of position value. Note that, too be conservative, the cost of the hedge above was calculated using the ask price of the puts and the bid price of the calls; in practice, an investor can often buy puts for less (at some price between the bid and the ask), and sell calls for more (again, at some price between the bid and the ask), so, in reality, an investor would likely have paid less than $2,705 when opening this collar. The threshold on this collar takes into account the cost of hedging, i.e., in the worst case scenario, the investor would be down 15% including the cost of the hedge (the investor be down 10.46% in the worst case scenario not including the hedging cost).
