Play Alibaba Through Yahoo - Cramer's Lightning Round (4/7/15) | Seeking Alpha Cramer does not believe in Mannkind Corp. Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM ): "I like Salesforce.com. It's got momentum and Marc Benioff is putting up the points and they are taking share. What's not to like?" Hanesbrands (NYSE: HBI ): "You want to stick with Hanes and remember it doesn't matter about the split. What matters is the momentum to the earnings, and it's terrific." Mannkind Corp. (NASDAQ: MNKD ): "Your patience should wear thin, and that's why you should sell it. I am not a believer in Mannkind." Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ): "No. You want to play Alibaba through Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) and there is a residual that's much too cheap."
