Here's Why Apple's Huge Cash Pile Is Now One Of Its Biggest Problems - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple's cash balances will only continue to grow outside the U.S., given how quickly China has become its largest market. A repatriation tax holiday is not on the cards. It's a popular topic, but it's not going to happen. Apple and its board must figure out how to untie their own hands. The company has to make a large acquisition outside of the U.S. to give it some flexibility with its cash. Ahead of Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) fiscal second-quarter earnings report, like most investors - I had my hand out , demanding more of Apple's cash. And for this, I offer no apologies. Apple obliged, sort of. Its board of directors authorized an increase of more than 50% to the to its original program, meaning Apple will now return a total of $200 billion of cash to shareholders. And the company promises to complete this March 2017, or roughly two years. $200 billion sound great, right? Not really. What this means is, Apple raised its buyback program by 'just' $50 billion, from the $90 billion level that it announced last year to $140 billion where it stands today. And when combining this with an 11% increase in its quarterly dividend the market broadly applauded. But I wasn't impressed. Sure, when combined with fiscal second-quarter earnings results that topped even the most bullish expectations, the cash Apple is willing to share seemed impressive. But after taking some time to read over Apple's 10Q, released Tuesday, I can drawn one conclusion, Apple is still a cash hoarder. And in fairness, that's not Apple's fault. The company can only do what its limited U.S. cash allows it to do, given that the bulk of its cash and investments are held overseas. Still, that's a problem that Apple - like many U.S. companies, particularly large tech names - must address. Consider, $171 billion of its $193.5 billion of cash/investments is offshore. This means almost 90% of its cash has limited functionality. And I say "limited" given that Apple - the world's riches company - has to take on debt to fund its repurchase program. And in some cases, it needs debt and/or bond sales to operate its business, whether for "financial engineering" or otherwise. In other words, the value of the 10% to 12% of cash that Apple has in the U.S. is as useful as the extent it can borrow against that cash (and cash flow) to fund its dividends and buybacks investors are hoping for. And its for this reason that $50 billion worth of shares that Apple is committed to buying over the next two years is not as impressive as it could have been. Am I overreacting? Perhaps. But consider, $50 billion in the next two years amounts to roughly 3.6% of the outstanding shares per year. "Yes, Richard, but Apple also raised its dividend by 11%." ... I get that. But the annual yield is still below 2%, ranking it one of the lowest payers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Not to mention, the yield is still below the 2% average of dividend-payers in the S&P 500. And when you consider that Apple's cash balances will only continue to grow outside the U.S., given how quickly China has become its largest markets, Apple certainly could have paid more. I'm not suggesting Apple didn't want to. Nor am I suggesting Tim Cook and the board are deliberately stingy. But Apple and its board must figure out how to untie their own hands. A repatriation tax holiday is not on the cards. It's a popular topic, but it's not going to happen - not with elections on the horizon and large corporations still perceived as villains. Nor should Apple operate with the assumption that a tax holiday is on the horizon. The company, then, has to make a large acquisition outside of the U.S. to give it some flexibility with its cash, given the bulk of its revenue now comes internationally. I'm not ready to speculate on which companies Apple could buy, but suffice it to say, Apple needs a big deal now more than ever before. It's the only way to remove its label as a cash hoarder.
