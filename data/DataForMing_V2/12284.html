ETF Hub Mar 25 2015, 13:53 ET | About: Facebook (FB) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor Mark Zuckerberg has kicked off Facebook's ( FB -1.2%) F8 developer conference by disclosing Messenger MAUs have topped 600M (up from November's 500M), and that Facebook Groups users now top 700M. WhatsApp is still said to be above 700M (as announced in January). A Bloomberg column previously mentioned Facebook's Messenger user base had reached 700M, but no longer does so. Zuck has also unveiled (confirming a recent TechCrunch report ) the Messenger Platform , which allows 3rd-party developers to integrate their apps with Messenger. Over 40 apps are initially supported, including ESPN, The Weather Channel, Imgur, and a slew of independent content/media apps such as JibJab, PicCollage, and UltraText; an SDK rolls out today. Disclosed along the way: Messenger now handles 10% of all VoIP phone calls. Also launching: Businesses on Messenger , a solution that lets businesses use Messenger to chat with and send alerts to consumers (and vice versa). Zulily and Everlane are initial supporters of the feature, which can be launched from a business' site. Cloud customer support software vendor Zendesk ( ZEN -1.4%) is working with Facebook to "support the live chat experience;" cloud live chat software vendor LivePerson ( LPSN -0.5%) might be in the crosshairs. Other news: 1) Facebook will begin supporting the uploading of 360-degree (spherical) videos to the news feed, and also plans to bring the feature to Oculus. 2) Facebook's sharing feature has been overhauled to include new tools. 3) Facebook, which now sees 3B+ daily video views, is testing continuous autoplay videos; when one video ends, another starts.
