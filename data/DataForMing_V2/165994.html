EBay At 20: Showing Its Age - eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) | Seeking Alpha As one of the first major players, eBay pioneered an industry. However, its business model is becoming increasingly irrelevant, which is reflected in its results. Last week eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY ), one of the world's first and best-known e-commerce names, celebrated its 20th birthday. In the age of the internet, this is quite a venerable age, and the passing of the mark offers a suitable opportunity to review the company's prospects. At 20, the company is starting to show its age, as it lags growth in the broader market and increasingly cedes market share to players like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ). By now more or less a legacy business, it is hard to see upside catalysts aside from its relatively low valuation. Even before the PayPal spinoff, it was fairly clear that eBay's marketplace segment was simply not keeping up with the broader industry. According to Forrester US e-commerce sales grew by an average of about 9.4% per year between 2011 and 2014. In 2015, the growth rate is projected at roughly the same number. How does eBay stack up? Increasingly badly. In 2013, eBay marketplace still outpaced matched the overall industry growth rate, US sales up 14% versus an 11.5% increase for the industry overall. Not bad at all. By the end of 2014, things weren't looking quite as good. Overall marketplace revenue increased by only 6%, versus the 10.3% growth recorded in US e-commerce sales. This year, things are looking even worse. A recent report highlights eBay's main problem, which is that its traditional business model isn't really working any more. Consumers today prefer buying a product instantly, rather than risking a sniper picking off the highly prized baseball card or comic book they have been waiting to buy for weeks. A report released in March shows just how much consumers have gone off the auction model. In February, eBay's auction sales fell by a whopping 26%, while its fixed-price sales rose by 8.6%. Overall, comp store sales growth clocked in at 5.5%, well below the 15% industry average used by comScore and ChannelAdvisor. The number is barely comparable to the 22.7% growth recorded by Amazon over the same period. In January , Amazon's growth rate was at 27% versus overall eBay marketplace growth of 8.6%. eBay has proven itself reluctant to let go of its auction business model, which was initially wildly successful, but now feels more like a relic of another time. To remain relevant, it must move more of its sales to a fixed-price model, but even in this sphere, it doesn't come anywhere near Amazon in terms of growth. eBay's expected earnings growth rates aren't particularly convincing either. This year, annual EPS is expected to drop by around 6.4%. Between 2015 and 2016, things are expected to recover, with earnings growth projected at 10.1%. This isn't bad, but it also isn't great. As far as I can tell, the only tangible benefit eBay has over Amazon right now is its valuation. The stock currently trades at 13.7 times trailing earnings, which is certainly lower than the 21.5 industry average as well as Amazon's negative P/E. It is also well below the company's historical average. However, valuation alone does not an investment thesis make. eBay pioneered the world of e-commerce with its auction-based business model, helping create an industry that is now booming. However, as its business model became increasingly irrelevant, replaced by a faster fixed-price model, the company is starting to show its age. Even its fixed-price segment cannot compete with Amazon in terms of sales growth, and sales in its auction segment continue to plummet. Without a near-term catalyst in terms of fixed-price sales growth, and without PayPal to pad its results, it's hard to make a case for upside in the near future.
