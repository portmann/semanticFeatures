Wall St. opens higher as GM, Boeing beat estimates | Reuters U.S. stocks opened higher on Wednesday as investors cheered strong third-quarter results by industry heavyweights Boeing and General Motors. Shares of General Motors (GM.N) rose 4 percent to $34.84, while Boeing (BA.N) rose 2 percent to $141.68, providing the biggest boost to the Dow. Biogen (BIIB.O) rose 7.8 percent to $286.45 after it said it would cut 11 percent of its workforce and reported better-than-expected results. The stock gave the biggest boost to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite indexes. "During the course of the third quarter, we actually saw consensus estimates drop for both revenue and earnings," said Eric Weigand, senior portfolio manager at the Private Client Reserve at U.S. Bank. "You could make the point that there is a low hurdle for companies to exceed on these diminished expectations." Of the S&P 500 companies that have reported results so far, 40 percent have exceeded revenue estimates. About 60 percent typically beat estimates in a quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data. S&P 500 companies are expected to report a 3.9 percent decline in third-quarter profit and a 3.8 percent fall in revenue.

Eight of the 10 major S&P sectors rose, with the industrials sector's .SPLRCI 0.5 percent rise leading the advancers. Coca-Cola (KO.N) fell 1.2 percent to $41.79 after its revenue missed estimates. American Express (AXP.N) and eBay (EBAY.O) report after the close. Adding to the upbeat mood on Wednesday were two large tech acquisitions.

KLA Tencor (KLAC.O) soared 23 percent to $66.30 after the semiconductor equipment maker agreed to be bought by Lam Research (LRCX.O) in a $10.6 billion deal. Lam rose 9.2 percent to $76.57.

Chipotle (CMG.N) fell 7.7 percent to $651.22 a day after the burrito chain posted disappointing third-quarter results.
