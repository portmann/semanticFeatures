Yahoo Should Avoid The Temptation To Buy Back Stock Right Now - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha To screen ETFs by asset class, performance, yield and more, check out the ETF Hub. ETF Hub YHOO approved new $2 billion buyback program, adding to near $730 million remaining on previous buyback program. Investors have been calling for YHOO management to buyback stock while waiting on the BABA spinoff. Yahoo! (NASDAQ: YHOO ) recently added $2 billion to an existing buyback program that had nearly $730 million remaining. While the stock has fallen over 10% in 2015 alone, management might be tempted to use that allowance to buyback stock aggressively right now. However, the best policy is to wait, not buyback one more share until after SpinCo is established. Here's why. At Alibaba's (NYSE: BABA ) current market capitalization, Yahoo's stake is worth $31.5 billion, more than 75% of Yahoo's total market capitalization. Assuming this ratio remains unchanged, and Yahoo's stock tracks the performance of Alibaba leading to the spinoff, Yahoo's underlying business is worth about $10 billion following the divestment. After the spinoff, that will be Yahoo's new valuation. If Yahoo were to spend that $2.7 billion all before the spinoff, it would buyback just 6.5% of its outstanding shares. However, if Yahoo waits, and is valued at $10 billion, it would buyback 27%. For an idea of what buyback activity like this could do for Yahoo's stock, just look at its last five years of buyback activity . During that span, Yahoo reduced its shares outstanding by 32% and the result was a stock performance that doubled the performance of its market capitalization. Specifically, Yahoo's market cap increased 92% and its stock 185%. If Yahoo were to buyback stock right now, the effect would be minimal because Yahoo's stock is so closely tied to the performance of Alibaba. This is a trend I can't imagine will change until after the spinoff. However, if spending $2.7 billion relative to a $10 billion company, the effect would be significantly reducing its shares outstanding, increasing its earnings per share, and creating substantial buying pressure in the stock. For this reason, Yahoo should not buyback one share of its stock until after SpinCo is established.
