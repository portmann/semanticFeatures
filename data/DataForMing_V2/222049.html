Is The Sky The Limit For Amazon, Or Is It This Number? - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Amazon has been on run since reporting earnings, but external factors are likely to be more important. This article will examine the recent movement of AMZN in light of its historical market valuation. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) announced earnings on October 22nd, beating on both the top and bottom lines, and the stock has been on a tear ever since. This leaves the stock with a trailing PS (price to sales) ratio of 2.9. This article will examine the recent movement of AMZN in light of its historical market valuation and risk factors which I believe the market is not yet fully appreciating. I've already documented the historical correlation between AMZN stock and its price to sales ratio. The following table updates those numbers on a historical, current and forward basis: all values except share prices in millions The extremes of this of chart are almost certainly not very relevant at this moment. The forward outlook should contain a 1-year discount in order to be considered valid, though perhaps we can consider $640 an upper limit for valuing AMZN via a price to sales methodology. More obviously, the market is clearly not valuing AMZN at 1.5 times sales, and it would likely take future developments to change that, yet further news would make trailing numbers even less pertinent. Therefore, I think the hybrid number is the best indicator of current fair value, but the chart as a whole is indicative how strongly current pricing and sentiment are currently skewed towards risk. Some will say that all of these numbers are invalid because the share price of AMZN has already exceeded most of them. Perhaps. I've already written about the possibility of the stock leaving the Price to Sales correlation behind, and Amazon has seen fourth quarter anticipation like this just two years ago, right before my first article was written. The stock had risen by a third on a similarly good earnings report, which like this one, featured a hint of AWS growth. Then, as now, Amazon skewed more towards a forward PS valuation in conjunction with positive sentiment. However, in the fourth quarter, Amazon announced record sales which barely missed Wall Street's lofty expectations; the stock gave it all back and spent the rest of the year bouncing repeatedly off the $300 bottom that my article predicted. It's only relatively recently that AMZN has exceeded the $500 ceiling that article also laid out, which I'd say is to be expected over the course of two years, in a rising market with near-zero interest rates, due to simple inflation. As hinted above, I think the main reason for Amazon's stock movement is optimism over AWS, which did report some good results. The segment has grown from the 4% of total revenue cited in my original article, to about 8% of the business now. At that rate, AWS could grow to match the retail side in about 40 years. That is, of course, unless Amazon's retail business stagnates or backslides, but that wouldn't exactly constitute bull thesis. AWS does have some advantages, though, particularly: Amazon is a master marketer, something I think many other cloud providers lack. The company "eats its own dog food", as they say, by making extensive internal use of AWS. This adds scale, allows for rationalization of costs, and employment of flexible (as well as sadly opaque) accounting. I think the first bullet point is a real competitive advantage over the short and medium terms. An excellent example is Snowball, the company's new data migration tool, which makes it very easy to get vast amounts of data onto AWS. As a programmer, the issue I see here is lock in. It may not be until many months and dollars later that companies come to think of the name as Animal Farm reference . The second bullet point is another sort of marketing, this time to investors. Of course, Amazon has many other technology initiatives besides AWS, though these have shown even less progress. Amazon Pay has real potential, given the synergies, though a critical mind might ask how well Amazon will manage against the likes of PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL ), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), and others when it apparently can't compete with Groupon (NASDAQ: GRPN ). Perhaps the new line of Fire devices will not need to be virtually given away for a dollar each, like the old ones were. My point with all of this is not that Amazon tech initiatives are doomed; it is that they largely leverage, or are meant to benefit, its retail business, and Amazon still deserves to be viewed in that category. Succeeding in retail at the expense of margins is one thing. Succeeding in technology is NOT an area where Amazon has shown real success so far. As a result, I think what remains most important for Amazon investors is its prospects for profitability as a retailer. The company has gotten a pass on the sales tax issue from a dysfunctional U.S. Congress. In fact, I credit much of the 2014 stagnation and 2015 rebound to the fact that the MFA (Marketplace Fairness Act) wasn't officially dead until the turn of the year. The specter of tax change still remains in the form of the RTPA (Remote Transactions Parity Act), which could affect many businesses , but I wouldn't be at all surprised to see this bill suffer the same purgatorial fate as its predecessor, at least until after the next major election, 1 year from now. It's possible that the election results could pose an indirect threat , as well, if the trend towards Republican victories continues. Two other dangerous tax issues could materialize sooner, though. In Europe, Amazon seems all to likely to have to pay the piper on the issue of tax avoidance , as the company has paid just over half a percent in taxes on its European turnover. It would be difficult to overstate the importance of this matter as back taxes alone could run into the "billions of euros" and emerging markets are far from safe as well. In the U.S., I expect that Amazon's practice of hiring more temporary workers than it does permanent ones will face increasing scrutiny. With one year left, the current administration has a clear, populist pro-worker agenda, and all bets with Amazon, which is no stranger to unfair work place litigation , may now be off. The Huffington Post has a long, but characteristically well-written and balanced write-up on the issue of dual-class workers. Amazon's efforts to build new portions of its workforce using contractors is already facing pressure , as well, and it's far from clear whether or not the company is on the right side of the law in these matters. Although Amazon turned in a good report, I think that some of the most important factors facing the company in the coming year are likely to be external, and that the market is barely recognizing their magnitude, so far. Simple anti-trust cases sluiced away a quarter Qualcomm's (NASDAQ: QCOM ) market cap last year. Amazon's issues are likely bigger and it is less equipped to deal with them. With markets near all-time highs, I think we may have just seen a top in AMZN, and it would take another leg up, above $640 to get me to seriously consider the possibility that the stock has changed its trading dynamic for the long term.
