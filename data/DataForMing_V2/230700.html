Etsy To Be Avoided At All Costs - Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY) | Seeking Alpha Etsy's ship has sailed. It is no longer the leader in what it does and will soon be crushed by Amazon. Etsy is adding to its own troubles by overspending on advertising to try and drive business. Etsy (NASDAQ: ETSY ) is a perfect example of a company that we think probably peaked before it even went public. We don't mean this in the sense of sales growth, revenue, or amount of total items listed on its site. We mean it from the perspective of where the company's model is going to sit in terms of being adopted by the public. The Etsy fad may have already been past us by the time the company finally listed its shares publicly. Usually, when that happens, you wind up with a post-IPO stock price that looks like this: On one hand, we have to commend Etsy because it did rush quickly enough to IPO, but on the other hand, Etsy is very much like many IPOs we have seen before it. We believe the company has hit Wall Street in a timely enough fashion for it to be shorted down to the levels where it should have went public at to begin with. The market's price action on the company tells you exactly what you need to know. The market is telling you that the company's initial public offering price was too high, and the market is telling you that the company's business model is in jeopardy, already. The idea behind Etsy wasn't necessarily a bad one. In this day and age, where millennials are looking for all natural products, organic, gluten-free, and farm fresh, Etsy tried to take this concept and move it to arts and crafts. This was a natural transition as many arts and crafts are already handmade, and there are people out there (we know them) that just like to purchase small handmade items. The thought process is that they are original, they are one-of-a-kind, they cannot be duplicated, and that you, as the consumer, are essentially "treasure hunting." But that has led to problems like this one : Etsy Inc. is facing fraud claims from investors after allegations that millions of items sold through its online crafts and specialty wares marketplace likely violate trademarks. Investors filed a proposed class action against the Brooklyn, N.Y.-based company and its executives after an analyst said this week that more than 5 percent of about 40 million listings may be counterfeit or otherwise infringe well-known brands. It's not a bad idea, which is why Etsy was able to file for an initial public offering in the first place. The company had grown very well since being a startup and is looking now to reach a launching point where it can hopefully find its next stage of growth. We commend the company for trying to do this, but we do not believe that Etsy is going to be a success and we do not believe that Etsy as an investment is worthwhile. All we have to do is think of examples of other companies that went public for the same reason. Zynga (NASDAQ: ZNGA ), for instance, went public at the height of the Farmville craze. Investors did not seem to care that the company didn't have much else in the pipeline, and once the "intuitive" Farmville 2 didn't work out, the company ran out of ideas, the stock crashed, and here is where we are today. Etsy is also taking a page out of Angie's List (NASDAQ: ANGI ). ANGI has been, for the street, hardly a success story. It shares many characteristics with Angie's List in the sense that the company is looking for a lot of its growth from advertising; advertising expenses at Etsy have ramped up significantly. Compare this to a company like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), that does very little traditional advertising. We believe that this shift to more advertising and marketing, similar to the Wayfair (NYSE: W ) model, shows that the company is having trouble driving organic growth. Also, Amazon, the largest retailing force in the world is now competing directly with Etsy. We would make the suggestion that Amazon could potentially be a buyer of Etsy, but we would have to wait for Etsy to fall 50% lower or more for the multiples to make sense. Even then, we're not convinced Amazon would buy them. Amazon has started its own handmade section of its website to try and compete directly with Etsy, and it has largely been a success. Amazon is leveraging its massive already installed user base and enormous infrastructure to try and take a large share of Etsy's market. Etsy's equity is priced at a large multiple to what the company is expecting to earn in the coming years. The worst part about this is that we do not believe that Etsy stock deserves much of a multiple at all. We think this is more of a show me story, because we cannot believe that the company's business model is going to be safe moving forward. So much of what has made the company a success to this point is that it was the leader, and the only site, doing what it did. As other sites catch on, namely Amazon, we believe that Etsy is in real risk of never getting off the ground. Etsy sports a $996M enterprise value while doing $250M annually in sales. The only decent metric it has right now is its EV/sales of 4.08, which would make it an attractive buyout candidate for Amazon. We think AMZN won't even consider it unless Etsy gets much cheaper. We think Amazon has all of the leverage in this situation. One positive is that Etsy doesn't have much debt, just $10M to the $286M in cash it has and it is generating about $19 million in cash per 12-month period. But the final word is that Etsy is a lightweight. With too many questions about its model and poor fundamentals that were ignored in a forced IPO, we think Etsy goes much lower before shareholders have anything to write home about. The bankers and underwriters of the company's initial public offering will be long gone soon, if they are not already, and those reading articles like this looking to find out whether or not Etsy has a future, we believe will be the people holding the bag.
