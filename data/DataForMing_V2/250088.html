Why Netflix Is One Of My Top Picks For 2016 - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Netflix fundamentals, while opaque and difficult to understand, still seem compelling. Analysts have changed their tune on Netflix, and the most credible Netflix analyst believes there is significant growth potential over the next five to ten years. Given feasibility and market dynamics, I'm a little more optimistic when compared to Wall Street analysts. This is mostly due to the expansion possibility in Asia, efforts to produce high-quality content, and historical growth comparison. Furthermore, when compared to peers trading at even higher multiples, I feel like the valuation argument is misconstrued. As such, it sounds paradoxical, but perhaps NFLX is undervalued. The investment community is in love with Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ), but it wasn't always that way. In the initial stages, investors were skeptical of the inherent growth potential, and quite frankly, who wouldn't be? Early stage growth investors are extremely rare on Wall Street. Most of these high-octane growth-oriented managers work at a VC firm in California enjoying the weather and modern tech culture. Whereas frigid New Yorkers will take turns pounding sell orders whenever things get frosty following a bad or pathetic quarter. California guys keep their cool even when they live on an earthquake fault line, but New York traders? Yeah right. We've seen so many fat finger circuit breaker issues with Netflix that it barely even fazes me anymore when CNBC panelists jump up and down after a 25% drop or a 20% move in a single day. For those of you who don't know, NFLX makes a frequent visit to the biggest mover on the NASDAQ list. So, color me surprised (sarcasm) if we see the same pattern of volatility. The fainthearted, risk-adverse individual will collapse from a heart attack owning this name, so unless you're prepared for many more grueling/euphoric moments, it's advised that you click the back button. Netflix is a public, large-scale experiment of a publicly-traded, early growth stage company. Investors shriek at the multiples, bad quarters can lop off the valuation by 25%. Heck, the cash usage is high in some quarters, maybe too high, and the level of liquid assets have reached dangerous territories in the past. Netflix has demonstrated much more consistency recently. It continues to execute on every quarterly, otherwise bears would form a line formation to attack bulls with investor presentations. Oh wait, I take that back, they still do! In a recent note, published on November 19th, RBC Capital Analyst Mark Mahaney reiterated his earlier stance, and supplemented it with a very in-depth presentation (37 pages long), but here's the most important paragraph from his presentation: Part of our Bullish Bias on NFLX stems from our belief that the market underestimates the company's long -term earnings potential. Simply put, we believe that under a range of "reasonable" assumptions, NFLX can generate $10 in long-term (within 5-10 years) annual EPS. Those "reasonable" assumptions are that Netflix can support 200MM global paying subscribers, with an $11 ARPU and 30%+ Operating Margins. We'll detail these assumptions below, but our stock-picking belief is that a secular growth, high-visibility subscription model with $10+ in EPS power would carry at least a market premium P/E multiple of 20X, which implies the ability for NFLX to achieve a $200 stock price within the next three-five years, depending on how quickly it can ramp up to our "reasonable" assumptions. And that's why NFLX is an attractive Long - though not a table-pounding Long - at $120. I'm fairly certain sales will start to accelerate going into FY 2016, as the company has uniquely positioned itself in a number of foreign markets. To sustain a healthy growth rate, it's worth noting that the company needs to develop a continuous pattern of generating hits, and continue the aggressive marketing of its service in conjunction with its top TV shows. However, it's worth mentioning that four of Netflix's hot series: House of Cards, Daredevil, Narcos and Orange is the New Black will release their next season in the 2016 timeframe. In other words, Netlix is really piling on the momentum, which coincides with the launch of Netflix in major regional markets like China, India and the Middle East. China is the most crucial market, as it's hard to create locally produced TV dramas that are globally competitive from the context of international viewership. Not every Chinese movie star will rise to the top viewing charts like Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, and Jet Li. And quite frankly, Netflix not only needs to produce great movies in China, but they will need to create an overnight Chinese sensation. To be honest, creating another Jackie Chan won't be easy. However, Netflix can provide the highest paying and most stable outlet for global movie and show releases from Asian studios via its platform. After all, many of the major Korean and Japanese media companies have struggled with westward expansion as there are many restrictions placed on the standard cable model. In fact, when was the last time you saw a foreign import make it onto a live television broadcast with the exception of Telemundo Novelas and Japanese Anime? A huge chunk of the Asian film market is dominated by Japanese and Korean studios, which then get exported into other Asian markets. Korea's pop culture is heavily underrated, and their version of Hollywood, which is referred to as "Hallyu-wood" has penetrated the airwaves of almost every Asian household. In other words, Netflix's efforts in Japan and Korea are absolutely critical, and I'm almost certain Ted Sarandos (Chief Content Officer) already knows this, which is why he's making a push into Korea in 2016. In other words, they're setting up their service in the Hollywood of the east. Going forward, they will need content from major Korean studios if they want any legitimate chance of penetrating into Asia. KBS, MBC, SBS are the three names that will make or break their Chinese expansion. Korea's economy isn't just a powerhouse because they make good phones, great TVs, and good cars. The major Korean movie studios define what's cool and socially acceptable. In fact, I'd blame China's cultural revolution on Korea's own implementation of east-west social convergence. The brand placements are mind-bogglingly obvious from the context of a western viewer, and if you count the number of objects intentionally placed into the various Korean-sets, you'll notice why Asia has become such a status-driven culture. After all, Bae Yong Joon (Korea's most well-renowned mega star) drives a Mercedes Maybach. Jeez, is it any wonder German Automakers are killing it in Korea's own backyard? To win Asian consumers, you legitimately need celebrity endorsements in one form or another. The key takeaway? Netflix will not only generate revenue from a subscription model but if they start filming movies and shows for the Asian demographic, they'll earn a lot of money from product placements. Hence, it's not just the impending subscriber base potential, but the incremental revenue from product placement advertising that makes Asia interesting. Therefore, I anticipate that the revenue ramp in some of these foreign markets to accelerate beyond the long-term revenue forecasts of analysts. It's not exactly clear what Netflix will generate from product placement revenue. But, there's no denying that it's extremely effective, especially in Asia. Netflix will generate a repeated pattern of hits Netflix is building a Pixar-esque hit culture through its own studios. That pattern of building tentpole franchises needs to continue given their diverse audience demographic. Furthermore, the launch into foreign markets requires a more multicultural approach to content similar to Marco Polo, which took place in Mongolia during a moment in history that's briefly skimmed over in the world history books, and is one of the most interesting time periods beyond the proverbial World War 2, U.S. Civil War, Revolutionary War genres. It's important that Netflix continues to develop war-themed content, as viewers respond particularly to the drama and action category in international markets, as high budgets films/TV sets are hard to replicate due to cost barriers, and feasibility dynamics within the emerging markets. Mark Mahaney forecasts revenue growth to accelerate to 29% in the next fiscal year, which compares to current fiscal year growth of 23%. He's at the higher end of the consensus range with his $8.76 billion revenue forecast. Personally, I still think it's somewhat conservative. But, given the conservative nature of sell-side models, it's pretty optimistic. Furthermore, Mahaney is one out of the two analysts that shows up on Netflix's quarterly earnings conference webcasts, so he's one of the few guys on Wall Street with legitimate Netflix clout. In Q4'FY 15, Netflix's subscriber growth is expected to grow by 61.32% year-over-year. The rapid expansion into international markets expanded the TAM to 207 million households over the course of 2015. That indicates that Netflix's penetration into international households will reach 14.2% by end of the current fiscal year (based on the 29.49 million in members they're projecting for next quarter). Furthermore, I anticipate that penetration for pre-established international markets to expand by 5 to 7 points per year based on the historical comps of UK and Canadian penetration. Netflix's international launch into Asia and a couple additional European countries expands the addressable market to 450 million (approximately). I anticipate that Netflix's international subscriber base to grow based on an incremental 6-point improvement to its pre-existing international households, which adds up to 41.81 million international households, and an additional 5-points for launch into an additional 250 million households adding 12.5 million households. This totals to 54.31 million households by end of FY'2016 (84.16% year-over-year growth in subscribers). Netflix average $6.39 in monthly revenue per international subscriber, and since subscriber figures vary by quarter my sales forecast adjusts for the incremental addition of subscribers. As such I work off of 41.9 million in paying subscribers, because on aggregate only half the subscribers will pay for the full duration of a year. Therefore, my revenue forecast for international when based off of current ARPU and penetration rates is $3.2 billion. I anticipate the domestic segment to sustain revenue growth due to a pricing increase to $9.99 per month, and incremental subscriber growth of 5%. The growth in pricing and membership implies a 16.66% sales growth rate in the domestic segment, which compares to 27.7% growth in FY 2015. Therefore, I anticipate the domestic segment to grow sales to $7.109 billion. The combined revenues of both segments may reach $10.309 billion in FY 2016, which puts me a full $1.61 billion above analyst consensus next year. When looking at the feasibility dynamics, I'm certain NFLX's revenue CAGR will in fact accelerate next year. Of course, the penetration rate may vary depending on region, but I believe there's a largely unfulfilled need for content in many of these markets. As such, I view a 5% initial penetration attainable, and continuous momentum from preexisting markets to continue. Furthermore, the content slate is fairly strong going into FY 2016, and I anticipate the momentum to carry into FY 2017 due to the on-going release of sequels to hit series and the roll out of Disney (NYSE: DIS ) titles to the platform. I see a very low probability of earnings/sales misses next year. I'm not offering an earnings estimate because it's extremely obvious that Netflix won't generate much profit as they're in a rapid investment phase. When compared to peers Netflix sits in the middle of the pack. That being the case, if $10.3 billion in sales is attained next year, the forward P/S multiple is 5.11. That's cheap even when compared to Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) and Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ). Therefore, on a comparative value basis, I think Netflix isn't as expensive as other internet peers. Sure, one could lament about how these internet peers trade at higher multiples, but that's because investors anticipate a combination of margin expansion and sales growth to normalize valuations over time. Given the strengthening fundamentals, improving competitive dynamics, and reasonable valuation I feel comfortable recommending Netflix. When normalizing earnings for long-term profitability I arrive at a relatively reasonable price target that seems to capture a feasible upside target over the immediate 12-month timeframe. Furthermore, I do anticipate volatility, but assuming strong execution in 2016, the stock will exhibit even more momentum than what the consensus price target implies. Therefore, I raise Netflix to high conviction buy for 2016. I'm initiating a price target of $160.09, which implies 29.82% upside from current levels. This valuation assumes 45.45 earnings multiple when normalizing the income statement for a long-term net income margin of 15%. I have to make arbitrary adjustments to the income statement in this case, which seems to be normal practice in VC-based models who then discount using a end of five-year period intrinsic value estimate. They then discount using a minimum hurdle rate. I don't use a discounting method, but rather I use comparative value to adjust the valuation into a feasible range for FY'16. There are many ways to skin the cat of valuation, but for the most part, I feel this approach is most appropriate when dealing with early stage growth companies that have not established a pattern of profitability but have provided enough evidence that they can in fact ramp profitability in future years.
