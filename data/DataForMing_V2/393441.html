The Amazon Echo mainstay is now available on its first device not produced by Amazon: the Triby, a connected message board of sorts for your home, office, or other destination.Â  Tribyâ€™s integration of Alexa comes just a month after Amazon announced it had improved developersâ€™ ability to use the personal assistant in their own devices. Alexaâ€™s presence in the portable voice-controlled hub built by Invoxia works much like it does inside Amazonâ€™s Echo: it can follow simple verbal commands, stream music, connect to other smart devices, and answer inquiries. â€œAs a company with a speciality in creating speakers and telecoms devices, we are excited by the world of possibilities consumer products like Triby offer families to improve their lives,â€? SÃ©bastien de la Bastie, managing director of Invoxia, said in a statement. While Triby and the Echo speaker are similar products, the Triby is more on par with Amazonâ€™s newer Echo Tap or Dot : portable and smaller.
