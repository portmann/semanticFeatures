Apple: Scaling The Great Wall With Apple Pay - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha AAPL is expected to roll out AAPL Pay in China by February of next year. AAPL is facing a combination of competitive risk, high barrier to entry and high marketing commitment as part of its AAPL Pay strategy. Partnership with Union Pay is precarious at best given UnionPay's prior interest in developing its own mobile payment platform. Wall Street Journal reported that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) plans to launch Apple Pay in China by February after securing partnerships with four of the largest banks in China, namely Industrial & Commercial Bank of China, China Construction Bank, Agricultural Bank of China and Bank of China. Although AAPL's rollout of its payment platform may give investors a reason to cheer, I believe there are a couple things worth considering in order to fully appreciate the risk AAPL is facing. First, given that China's digital mobile payment space is dominated by Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) and Tencent ( OTCPK:TCEHY ) that have a combined 65% market share and are deeply entrenched into Chinese consumers' lives, it's difficult to see how AAPL could achieve meaningful traction in the country due to a high barrier to entry (see - Apple: Will China Be A Game-Changer For Apple Pay? ). Second, relative to its Chinese peers which offer O2O and service integration with their payment app, AAPL Pay is a payment service in its simplest form and I do not believe that Chinese consumers will warm up to AAPL Pay given its lack of localized features. Additional incentive is necessary to facilitate the migration from rival payment platform to AAPL Pay, adding incremental cost pressure to AAPL. Finally, I believe that AAPL underestimated the competitive environment in China's payment market. In order to gain any meaningful traction, payment companies should invest in marketing to incentivize users and merchants to join its platform, particularly when the market boundaries are well-defined. AAPL investors could see marketing expense to rise in the medium term if AAPL is seriously committed to the Chinese market. I reiterate my cautious view on AAPL and its prospects in China. My preferred picks in China remain BABA followed by Tencent. AAPL's entry into China comes at a time when AAPL investors wonder where the company's next growth driver will be as the company is faced with iPhone maturity, declining iPad sales and soft Mac demand (see - Apple: The Music Will Stop Eventually ). China could be a growth market for AAPL but investors should not ignore the fact that the market is already entrenched by BABA and Tencent, together accounting for 65% of the overall market (see - Alibaba: Setting An Example In Mobile Payments ). When the market already has defined boundaries, driving penetration will be challenging and investors should look no further than Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU ), which dominates China's search market but faces headwinds in penetrating its own mobile payment platform. In order to gain any meaningful traction (rather than making a statement that they are in China), a large marketing commitment is required to convince existing AAPL users to migrate off WeChat and Alipay that are already linked to the users' bank accounts and handle their daily financial transactions from bill payment to grocery shopping to transportation and e-commerce. Breaking existing status quo will be difficult and migration is not going to materialize in the near-term (see - Alibaba: Beating Apple At Its Game ). Another risk to AAPL's growth in China is that mobile payment apps are evolving beyond simple payment and money transfer. AAPL Pay continues to live on the simple model involving money transfer to the user's account and linking various credit cards onto the payment platform without providing users with additional services and products. BABA's Alipay and Tencent's WeChat, on the other hand, goes beyond providing a payment solution to providing an ecosystem of product and services that can be transacted over their mobile app. In short, AAPL Pay is outdated relative to its Asian rivals and it will take time and effort for AAPL to create a competitive ecosystem given the existing partnerships between payment platforms and merchants (ie. BABA and Koubei, Tencent and Meituan). Finally, there is the precarious relationship with China's UnionPay, which conducts all of China's mobile payment transactions. UnionPay has been wanting to develop its own Android-based NFC payment system for years but it appears that the organization is unlikely to introduce a commercial product in the near term. That said, its partnership with AAPL Pay could just be a space filler for UnionPay to understand the mobile payment market, refine its own product and then gradually roll out its own platform to compete against AAPL (see - Apple And UnionPay: A Marriage Not Made In Heaven, Part II ). AAPL Pay's entry into China will be challenged by a combination of competitive pressure, high barrier to entry and heavy marketing spend. I remain bearish on AAPL's prospects in China's mobile payment space and continue to like BABA and Tencent. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
