Microsoft's 16% Dividend Increase Cements Legendary Dividend Stock Status - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft was highly criticized after its last earnings report, based on a massive loss due to its failed Nokia acquisition. But underneath the headlines, in fiscal 2015 Microsoft continued to do what it does best: generate huge amounts of free cash flow. Its high free cash flow is the reason why Microsoft can continue to lavish investors with double-digit dividend increases. Microsoft increased its dividend by 16% on September 16. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ) has struggled this year, as investors continue to have a hard time digesting its last earnings report, which looked very weak at first glance. The company suffered a huge loss, due to a very large write-down. Combine that with the fears of slowing economic growth in the emerging markets, and it's easy to see why Microsoft stock is in correction territory, down 12% from its 52-week high. But the company continues to be an excellent dividend growth stock. On September 16, Microsoft announced a 16% dividend increase . That might not seem logical at first, given its 43% decline in GAAP diluted earnings per share last year . But underneath the negative headlines, Microsoft continued to generate huge free cash flow. This is the far more important number for investors to focus on, and free cash flow is the reason Microsoft can deliver such outstanding dividend growth. Microsoft got a lot of criticism after reporting fiscal fourth-quarter earnings. Indeed, on the surface the headline numbers looked bad. It recorded a huge $3.2 billion net loss, but it's important to note that this was due entirely to a $7.5 billion impairment charge related to the Nokia device acquisition. Excluding all the various one-time charges, Microsoft would have earned $0.62 per share. That would have represented 10% year-over-year growth, so put differently, Microsoft's results were quite strong when evaluating the core underlying business. The reason for Microsoft's impressive core results is that the company has made huge strides in newer, higher-growth businesses. Formerly a PC-dependent entity, Microsoft has effectively transitioned itself, quite an impressive feat considering how huge of a company it is. For example, cloud revenue soared 88% (or 96% excluding foreign exchange) and reached an annualized rate that exceeds $8 billion due to the continued success of Office 365, Azure and Dynamics. Microsoft is enjoying broad-based growth across its other products as well. Tablet revenue grew 117% year-over-year as the Surface Pro 3 continues to sell very well. Xbox revenue increased 27%, and last but not least search revenue rose 21% as Bing captured an additional 100 basis points of search share year over year. The key takeaway from all this is that it's more valuable for investors to keep focus on free cash flow, and not the headline EPS numbers. Analyzing Microsoft in the context of free cash flow paints a vastly better picture. Microsoft is simply a cash flow machine. Despite the huge write-down that captured the news headlines, the bigger news should have been that Microsoft generated $5 billion of free cash flow last quarter and $23 billion of free cash flow in fiscal 2015. Mountain Of Cash Paves The Way For Higher Dividends All that cash is piling up on the balance sheet. Microsoft now holds $108 billion in cash, short-term investments and long-term investments, up from $100 billion this point last year. And, the company carries a modest debt load. Its long-term debt to equity ratio is a very manageable 34%. With so much cash flow and not a lot of debt to worry about, Microsoft can easily afford to increase its dividend. The company's free cash flow payout ratio stood at just 42% for fiscal 2015. Including its updated dividend, Microsoft has now raised its dividend by 17% compounded annually over the past five years. The stock now offers investors a 3.2% yield based on its new dividend payout. Thanks to Microsoft's excellent growth rates in its newer cloud-based businesses, as well as continued success in Microsoft's hardware and other businesses, it has more than enough financial flexibility to raise its dividend at high rates. There are simply very few stocks that can match Microsoft's unique blend of a high current yield as well as high dividend growth. Microsoft is an excellent holding for income investors of all sorts. Whether you are a retiree looking for income now, or a dividend growth investor with a long time horizon, there are few better dividend stocks out there than Microsoft.
