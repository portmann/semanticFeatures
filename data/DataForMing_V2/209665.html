Positive European Registration Data Good News For Ford - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha We continue to look to the European auto markets as part of our analysis on Ford. In addition to strong US sales and demand, Europe continues to be in an auto boom. In keeping with our monthly reports that are tracking the automotive market's momentum, specifically for Ford (NYSE: F ), we wanted to take a moment and look at some new European car registration data that continues to support our bullish thesis on Ford. For those that are new to our stance on Ford, we believe that a strong domestic backbone, coupled with investments and innovation internationally will eventually lead to growth on the bottom line, which we believe will be the key factor in finally getting the stock to move over $20. Throughout the course of our analysis, we've been looking at monthly domestic auto sales, European registration data, and quarterly earnings reports to make sure that the foundation of Ford continues to move in the right direction. Ford has rallied over the course of the last few training sessions, but as part of a bigger picture you can see that Ford has really been in a trading range for the better part of the last few months. We are OK with this, we just want to make sure the fundamental story has not changed as time progresses. This month saw another promising report out of Europe, one of the key markets for Ford and other automakers. The data was as follows; Overall EU registrations +9.8% Y/Y to 1,394,223 units in September led by double-digit demand growth in France, the UK, and Italy. We are encouraged by these numbers, and things look to continue moving in the right direction for the auto market both domestically and overseas. Growth continues overseas, while Ford still looks to fill out inventory to meet demand in the US. This is a great problem to have. We were a little cautionary about the company's recent investments in China to help reduce the next generation of vehicles, but we would much rather see Ford spending their money on innovation at this point in their life cycle, instead of blindly returning cash to shareholders like General Motors. F PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts We continue to believe that Ford's valuation is very attractive. For patient investors with a investing horizon in the years instead of months, we think sitting back and collecting Ford's dividend while the company continues to execute is a fantastic strategy.
