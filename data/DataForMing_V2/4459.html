ETF Hub Mar 16 2015, 09:56 ET | About: The Boeing Company (BA) | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor Having learned from past mistakes, Boeing ( BA +1.3%) is well-positioned to hit record production targets for its 737 by 2018, the head of its industrial system told Reuters . "To the extent that we could accommodate uncertainty and risk, or reduce risk, we are much better postured today than when we have tried this in the past," said Pat Shanahan, who oversees production at the world's biggest planemaker. Boeing's production lines face a crucial test as the company prepares to lift output of its bestselling jet by 24% while simultaneously shifting to the new 737 MAX. The planemaker has not attempted such a production boost and model shift since 1997, when it was forced to stop assembly of its 747 jumbo and delay building a new version of the 737 for several weeks due to parts shortages and distraction from its merger with McDonnell-Douglas.
