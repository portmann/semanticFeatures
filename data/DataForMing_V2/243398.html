Intel's 10nm Transition, And The Impact On Gross Margins - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel elaborated on their process advantage throughout the course of their 2015 investor day presentation. Given what was presented, it's fair to anticipate an improvement to yields and falling costs per transistor. This translates into higher successive gross margins through an investment and growth phase. I anticipate that if FCF/gross margin trends continue, the 10nm family should drive gross margins in excess of 65%. At this year's investor day conference , Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) went into excruciating detail with regards to their process improvements. More specifically, Bill Holt laid out much of the granular data, as investors have been wondering where Intel stands in terms of cost per transistor improvements, and the incremental R&D needed to sustain generational node improvements. For the most part, I came away impressed with the level of progress despite the lagging improvements to yield trends when compared to the 22nm Haswell generation. The company mentions that by the first half of 2016, the yields per wafer should be roughly equivalent to its 22nm counterpart. Furthermore, these yield improvements should translate into higher gross margins given the falling cost of transistors. As such, Intel's manufacturing process seems better from both a cost/performance standpoint when compared to TSM (NYSE: TSM ) and Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ). Also, there seems to be rampant speculation over Chinese competition, however, Chinese fabs with the exception of TSM are operating on much older process technology. Technically, TSM is based out of Taiwan and isn't keen on the idea of moving production into the Chinese mainland due to regulatory risks. Furthermore, Taiwan isn't a territory governed by the Republic of China, but of course, both sides take on an opposing stance when pertaining to territorial disputes. Nonetheless, when I refer to Chinese semiconductors, this discussion on Chinese semiconductors is not inclusive of TSM. While China is a competitive headwind, the degree to which it will impact Intel's core business seems limited. The growth primarily comes from low-end commodity semiconductor parts, low-end mobile components, semiconductor test and packaging, and manufacturing at older generation nodes (45 nm). The manufacturing capabilities of Chinese OEMs will likely improve over the next five years, but I find the Chinese government's push for domestic semiconductor development to be aggressive. I find the growth targets to be unobtainable given Intel's interest in lower cost commodity grade parts. Furthermore, when people refer to commodity parts, I'm referring to microcontroller units, which have very basic logic circuits and network capabilities to communicate data via wireless spectrum to the cloud. Intel believes that its strategic shift into the cloud begins with their Quark-class CPUs, which creates direct competition for Chinese OEMs. However, Intel's market position with its Quark MCU lineup is small. Intel occupies roughly 10% market share according to the investor day. Assuming Intel can penetrate into this market segment, the Chinese government and local VCs will need to step-up investment. The only problem with the Chinese approach? Intel's R&D is funded with a growing revenue base. As such, I find it difficult for smaller scale fab operators and semiconductor designers to remain competitive, assuming Intel is able to win major contracts with automobile companies and various other appliance/electronics manufacturers. The degree to which Intel can penetrate into the space is subjective, because there are a lot of moving parts, but there's no denying Intel has a performance/cost advantage when compared to Chinese fabs/design houses. It's also worth noting that if you normalize the logic circuits between Intel architecture and competing CPUs manufactured from different fabs, Intel has a density advantage. Higher is better in this instance, and when you pack more transistors into a logic circuit, the performance is enhanced. As such, Intel's position within desktop and laptop grade CPUs have remained relatively stable, as anyone attempting to compete with Intel would need to have both a competitive design and a manufacturing edge. Hence, AMD (NASDAQ: AMD ) has lost substantial market share over the years, and competing semiconductor brands have yet to come up with a clear-cut strategy for penetrating into Intel's competitive space. Therefore, investors should take into consideration Intel's manufacturing advantage as it does translate into better performance at a lower cost per integrated circuit. Intel also mentions that its cost per transistor decreases by 30% with each generational transition. However, the company anticipates that this historical pattern may not hold up. To be more specific, they believe they can generate a better CPT improvement from historical trends as they progress through 14nm and 10nm manufacturing. This all translates into higher gross margins once wafer yields stabilize. As such, investors should anticipate a higher return from every dollar invested into fab-related R&D, as Intel anticipate the cost-to-benefit ratio to progressively improve. Higher R&D is offset by a cost per transistor improvement despite the incremental CAPEX needs of each successive generation. The upside from better manufacturing technologies is reflected in future gross margins, whereas the upfront investment into future generation fabs is reflected in current FCF metrics. Over time, these new fabs squeeze out performance enhancements at a lower cost per transistor, which directly translates into lower cost of goods sold (later on down the road). Of course, it takes time to work off the incremental investment into a fab, which is depreciated on an accelerated straight line basis. Nonetheless, the capital investment is offset through increasing volumes and falling cost per unit. When looking at historical FCF to gross margin trends, the company's free cash flow metrics are the worst in a successive two-year cycle during Q1. Q1'FY12, Q1'FY14, and Q1'FY16 (forecast) generate the lowest quarterly FCF. However, following the drop-off in FCF, the gross margin tends to improve. Furthermore, there's a consistent uptrend in the lows and highs of gross margin in the past five years. Each successive generation generates a higher gross profit rate due to efficiency gains. The CFO anticipates a 62% gross margin rate as we enter into the next investment phase for 10nm manufacturing. This is pretty good because the cost improvements are also reflected through investment periods. Once we exit out of FY'16 we'll likely see a sizable improvement to gross margins perhaps 65% to 70% gross margins, which would make the 10nm CPU family the most profitable assuming gross margin and FCF trends remain constant. Therefore, when pertaining specifically to Intel's CAPEX and gross margin trends I remain optimistic. While gross margins aren't going to eclipse 2014 and 2015 to any meaningful extent, we're witnessing a pattern of improving profitability through each successive process node. As such, Intel's EPS will be driven by profitability and revenue growth over the next five years. I continue to reiterate my buy recommendation on Intel.
