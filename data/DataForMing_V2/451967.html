Verizon confirms redesigned app and price and data bucket increases - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha Jul  6 2016, 13:28 ET | About: Verizon Communications (VZ) | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor In a news conference, Verizon ( VZ -0.2%) confirmed changes to its plans and a revamped digital approach via a redesigned My Verizon app. As expected , its five data bucket sizes are increasing, but with slightly higher costs (its smallest plan goes up by $5/month to $35 but doubles data to 2 GB from 1 GB, while its "XXL" plan goes up $10 to $110 but offers 24 GB rather than 18 GB). A revamped app (auto-updated for existing My Verizon app users) will bring more visibility into data usage, the company says: A "data hub" will always say exactly how much data remains, where data is being used and who on the plan is using it. Verizon says it also offers simplified billing, personalized offers, and e-commerce options to shop for and upgrade devices without leaving the app. Among other announcements today, a data carryover feature will move unused gigabytes to the following month automatically; a "safety mode" will block overages and simply throttle customers to 128 kbps rather than 4G, once they hit their data limit (free to XL/XXL size plans, $5/month otherwise); "data boost" will let customers add a GB of 4G data for $15 at any time; and improved Mexico/Canada coverage (unlimited talk/text and no data roaming surcharges for XL and larger plans). As expected with all of McAdam's careless buying sprees of failed dotcom properties... they are worried how they will continue to pay dividends, pay their bogus bonuses and salaries and so with a cocky attitude.. McAdam rewards loyal VZ customers with price increases. It will come to haunt them as other carriers continue to strengthen their networks and absorb smart personal and corporate customers that are looking to keep their expenditures lower. This could be the sign of desperate mgt and as a VZ investor and one who is here for the dividend - I ask other VZ longs their thoughts on this development?
