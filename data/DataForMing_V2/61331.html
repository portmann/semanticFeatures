This Is What A $240/Share AAPL Would Look Like In Context | Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! New research shows that European banks are as likely to fail today as they were preceding the global economic crash 7 years ago. Bail-ins are now the rule. As far as the Central Banks are concerned, this is a good thing because if investors/depositors were ever to try and convert even a small portion of this “wealth” into actual physical... The World Platinum Council do not believe that platinum stocks will be completely depleted and reach zero because the amount includes long term holdings by private investors, sovereign wealth funds...

If Carl Icahn, whose $6.8 billion in AAPL holdings makes him nearly a 6x bigger holder of the stock than the Swiss National Bank, is correct and AAPL is truly worth $240/share today, or about $1.4 trillion, roughly equivalent to 9% of US GDP, then this is how AAPL would rank if it were a sovereign nation (and yes, we know comparing market cap to GDP is idiotic, but so is everything else these days). For the purists, at $240/share, AAPL would be 2.2x larger than the entire market cap of the Italian or Swedish stock market, 1.9x larger than all Spanish public companies combined, it would be almost the same size as the market cap of all Swiss companies, and is just about 70% of the market cap of Germany or France.

Sadly this is the world as it is and not much hope left for a soft landing and reset. I guess death and destruction are the coming cool thing....

I thought the Zios sanctioned them or some such shit? Mon, 05/18/2015 - 12:35 | 6105910 pods My wife went to upgrade her phone (of course Apple) and the people at the Verizon store were just gaga over Apple. The one chick sitting there was talking about the watch and how her and her dad were in competition on geting one, blah blah blah.  She suggested to my wife to get a certain color case because it doesn't show makeup on it.  'Like, if you apply a lot of makeup, like I do."   One guy piped up that you can draw on it and send the picture to others.   I about had to wash that place off of me when we left.  You would seriously pay $300+ for a way to send doodles to your friends? Mon, 05/18/2015 - 12:52 | 6105968 Jeff Cosford Are you kidding me we pay ballplayers 100's of millions per player in salary. A watch is nothing. Small compared to the need to fill freetime. Not everything has to be in the stricktest sense productive. Maybe when we get our priorities straight vis a vis ballplayers and say a school that really teaches somewhere then your on ot something.  Mon, 05/18/2015 - 12:36 | 6105911 e1618978 You are comparing GDP to market cap, a better comparison would be GDP to revenue instead.   The US isn't "worth" 16B, it just has that much revenue.

Mon, 05/18/2015 - 13:11 | 6106013 TheRideNeverEnds Once you consider the future QE (100% guaranteed and everyone knows it; only unknown is who when and how) all stocks are grossly undervalued and since Apple is a stock .... Mon, 05/18/2015 - 13:14 | 6106024 Counterpunch All stocks are overvalued, or most, the thing is relative degree of overvaluation, and ability to expand, to innovate, and to get repeat customers.  Apple's inroads into China continue to develop, india will be next but Chinese companies will block expansion at some stage.  Icahn naturally overstates it, but it remains one of the best tech stocks.  Essentially any argument apple bashers make applies even more to other tech companies.  all this said, if you go on amazon say and search for tablets, and order lowest to highest price, some of those low end companies are probably great buys.

I bought 50 or 60 new songs for it too after I burned all my old CD's....but that's the only apple product I've ever bought. No plans for future Apple products. Mon, 05/18/2015 - 15:47 | 6106758 Crocodile I have never been to France (no desire either) and I have never owned an Apple product (too "cheap"); give thumbs up if you are in the same boat and a thumbs down if you have been to France and/or currently use an Apple product.  Thanks...And the survey says??? why, think of it as a cable company equivalent, then price per user 300 million iphones sold * 4000/ user = 1.2 T  + cash 200b = 1.4 Trillion maybe even a premium cable co, as they will extract more rent from you than a standard cable co, so say 6,000/user or 1.8T + 200 billion cash= 2 trillion or $300+/share...just give it a year... Mon, 05/18/2015 - 15:06 | 6106515 Crocodile "Just give it a year"; as the market & the nation & the world goes...so goes Apple.  Of course the Chinese could save the Apple. Mon, 05/18/2015 - 14:51 | 6106450 tommylicious Icahn has gone bat shit crazy.  You can't pull this kind of crap with a stock in as bright a spotlight as AAPL.   Mon, 05/18/2015 - 15:04 | 6106507 Crocodile God has a great sense of humor; Apple represents all that is materialism/worldly & Obama is everything opposed to the principals the nation was founded (even the name shows His sense of Humor), which were godly.  Sadly; it will end very badly for most and only a remnant will escape the final judgment...just as it always is, for man is born to trouble as the sparks fly upward!
