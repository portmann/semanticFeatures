Apple: Positioned For Disappointment In India - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha The iPhone SE is struggling in India. SA Author Mark Hibben remains bullish on Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) based on his assessment of iPhone opportunities in India. There is no doubt India is a key growth market for smartphones and Apple has enjoyed some recent success there. The iPhone SE is seen by many as the launch pad for iPhone growth in price sensitive markets like India. Reportedly, Apple is near a deal with Foxconn to open a factory in India to manufacture Apple products. That will be a positive step but to my way of thinking it will be too little, too late. Key competitors like Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) have already set up plants in India and have gained substantial share of the market.

Weeks after the new device was launched a total of 36,313 iPhone SE units were shipped into India and the volume has fizzled thereafter. India's smartphone market is considered the next growth frontier by some, but shipments actually declined in Q1 2016. Apple has shown brisk growth in India from a small base but remains a distant eighth in terms of market share in India. Apple's Q1 2016 shipments to India grew 62% year over year with Apple joining Vivo, Lenovo, Oppo, Xiaomi and Asus in the 50% plus growth club. Huawei shipments declined 15 and local supplier Karbonn suffered a massive 56% drop, illustrating the volatility in this highly competitive arena. Some observers think Apple's success in Q1 will be short-lived. Amartya Baidya had this to say on May 4, 2016, in an article published on Dazeinfo.com Baidya publishes data showing that Samsung users have higher app engagement than iPhone users, a stunning reversal from the days when Tim Cook would proudly crow about the higher user engagement times evident among Apple device users. To make matters worse, after a lengthy and highly-publicized dispute between Cook and the FBI about access to iPhone data, resolved when the FBI found itself able to hack into an iPhone, recent reports indicate the Indian government can access encrypted data on an iPhone. It seems Cook's attempt to use the FBI access request to showcase iPhone security has done the reverse exposing the fact that iPhones are not secure at all. The recent collapse in iPhone sales and the weak guidance from the company indicate there is a real risk a tipping point has been reached. Competitors now offer better devices and offer them at more attractive prices. The Android ecosystem now surpasses the iOS ecosystem in size and quality in my opinion. If Apple does not innovate and innovate quickly, the company may face a trajectory similar to Palm, Nokia (NYSE: NOK ) and BlackBerry (NASDAQ: BBRY ) in a progression of lower sales, lower profits and lower stock price. India may well be next growth frontier for smartphones but unless Apple can truly compete with entrenched suppliers that have commanding market shares in India today, Apple's efforts may find success elusive.
