Apple Bonds See Higher Rates - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Did management miss an opportunity for lower rates? A couple of weeks ago, I detailed why I thought Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) should come out and issue more bonds . Management stated it would be entering the debt markets this year as it continues to execute a tremendous capital return plan. While the company did recently take out more debt, it appears that management may have missed an even better opportunity. On Wednesday morning, a prospectus was released that contains the terms of Apple's latest debt deal. In the table below, I've compared the most comparable issues between the latest deal and the US dollar one from May 2015 , in regards to fixed rate issues. There were also other issuances involved in these deals, but some were floating rate and in a case or two there were maturity times that did not match from deal to deal. You will notice that the only truly comparable issue is the 10-Year bond, since it has the same dollar amount. I bring that up because since the May 2015 debt deal, the 10-Year US Treasury rate has declined by about 35 basis points. Despite that decline, Apple is paying 5 basis points more, showing an increased risk profile regarding the name. A lower stock price thanks to iPhone worries probably has investors looking for a little more of a risk premium. In all five instances, Apple's interest rate was higher than it was for the past deal. This is where I wonder if management missed an opportunity for lower rates. As you will see in the chart below, the US 10-Year rate was much lower last week, falling to a low of 1.57%. On Wednesday morning, rates are about 25 basis points higher than that, a substantial jump as US markets have rallied the last few trading days and investors have fled safe haven Treasuries. While hindsight is 20/20, one must wonder what rates Apple could have gotten if it filed this debt deal last week. For the five issues listed above, the May 2015 weighted average interest rate was about 2.99%, but that jumped to 3.21% for the February 2016 issues. A debt offering last week probably would have likely saved Apple at least 10 basis points. That would have saved Apple about $9 million or so a year in pre-tax interest costs. While that doesn't seem like much in the Apple universe, every little bit adds up in the end, especially if you translate the savings over the life of these issuances. While interest rates and US markets have rallied from last week's low, so too have Apple shares, by nearly $5. Had this debt deal taken place last week, it might have allowed the company to come in and repurchase shares at lower prices. There have been many critics of Apple's buyback in recent years, especially with the repurchase of shares well above $120. Getting shares on the cheap allows the company to repurchase more shares, and retires shares at an even higher dividend yield. I recently looked at the dividend situation in regards to the buyback, and you can read that article here . In the end, Apple did come out with another huge issue of debt, which will allow the company to step in and repurchase tens of millions of shares. The company did pay higher rates this time around than its May 2015 deal, and while some of that was due to higher principal amounts, one must wonder what would have happened if this deal came a week earlier. Overall, a weighted average interest rate in the low 3s seems like a decent deal, especially after tax-savings, given Apple's dividend yield is currently 2.14%. Going forward, it will be interesting to see how much of this money is spent in the current quarter to repurchase shares, and if all of it is, does Apple increase its total buyback amount at the April earnings report?
