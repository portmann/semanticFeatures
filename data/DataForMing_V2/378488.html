Disney: A Bad Stock But A Good Company - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Disney is encountering solvable problems as it adapts to the changing media landscape. Disney's strong competitive advantages ensure long-term prosperity. Disney appears to be slightly undervalued at current levels. Disney (NYSE: DIS ) just reported its greatest quarter ever. That is quite a milestone for a company that has been around since 1923. Q4 revenue was up 14% yoy and EPS increased 28% yoy. Both numbers exceeded Wall Street's estimates. The studio entertainment and parks and resorts segments both generated over $1 billion in quarterly operating income for the first time. During the Q4 conference call, CEO Bog Iger said, "our results clearly show that our long-term strategic focus and investments in brands and franchises are driving remarkable value in these businesses, greatly increasing their impact on the Company and further diversifying our future growth." I think it is safe to say that this wonderful company is firing on all cylinders. A blow out quarter and a beautifully articulated conference call explaining the numerous growth opportunities that lie ahead (DIS did not give 2016 guidance) is usually a formula for a higher stock price, right? Wrong. The stock was down over 3% the next day and is currently 28% off its all-time high. Why? Because DIS has become a frustrating story stock that lives and dies by one metric, ESPN subscribers. The performance of Disney's stock has been disgusting ever since the company reported Q3 earnings at the beginning of August. The quarter was strong, earnings expectations were exceeded, yet the stock sold off sharply because the number of ESPN subscribers declined. This only augmented worries that a secular decline in the cable business was on the horizon because the younger generation is starting to consume media in different ways. This is troubling for DIS because its media networks business generates 41.5% of total revenue. However, the market is currently underestimating Disney's ability to adapt to the changing environment and completely ignoring the company's superior diversification. Sure, the younger generation is starting to consume content utilizing different mediums, such as smartphone apps and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ). However, it is the quality of the content that matters, not how it is consumed. It may not be on a television set, but people will always watch live sports and kids will always watch compelling movies and shows produced by Disney. Management pointed out in the conference call that 95% of Americans with a multi-channel bundle watched sports and 81% watched ESPN content in some form. This is not going to change anytime soon. Keep in mind that it is ESPN who has the rights to Monday Night Football, the College Football Playoff, Sunday Night Baseball, and college basketball's Big Monday. ABC has the rights to the NBA Playoffs and the NBA Finals. The Disney Channel continues to create shows and movies that attract kids to the television like a magnet. I consider myself a normal American man who enjoys sports. I will continue to pay for cable, if that is the only way I can watch Stephen Curry lead the Warriors to back to back titles this summer. I can still quote movies from my childhood, such as Motocrossed, Brink, and Double Teamed, which were constantly on the Disney Channel. Disney's management is aware of the changes taking place in the media industry and they are taking action to position themselves ahead of competitors. Iger says the company "will continue to focus on subscriber trends, moving quickly to embrace and create opportunities to drive value in the evolving market." The company has started to offer less expensive cable packages featuring ESPN, it is continuing to invest in Hulu as a media distribution platform, and it has distribution agreements with Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) and Netflix. Also, it is possible that subscriber declines have at least temporarily subsided. Management stated they have actually seen an uptick in ESPN subscriptions. However, the numbers do show a decline in operating income for the media segment attributed to an increase in programming and production costs offsetting an increase in ad revenue. It is important to note that operating income for the segment would have increased around 8% if the timing of the College Football Playoff was different. Even if operating income from Disney's cable business continues to slowly decline, I have confidence that management will take the appropriate steps to weather the storm. Disney has been able to successfully adapt to multiple disruptions that have taken place in the media industry over the past century. As stated earlier, it has been around since 1923 and will probably still be around in 2123. In addition to the highest quality content and phenomenal management, Disney has another competitive advantage that will provide a cushion as the media landscape changes. It has a diversified business model with multiple segments that continue to perform remarkably. DIS has been able to acquire a vast umbrella of brands and franchises that drive long-term performance across all segments of the business. In the Q4 conference call, COO Tom Staggs refers to Disney's long-term strategy as, "purposeful diversification." The ultimate catalyst for the Disney machine is the iconic movies and characters that are consistently created by the studio entertainment business. Disney is able to leverage themes and characters to amplify revenues in the parks and resorts and consumer products/interactive segments of the business. For example, Disney has experienced a massive uptick in sales of consumer products related to Star Wars. It is planning to open new Star Wars theme lands at Disneyworld and Disneyland and is adding more themed attractions to parks across the world. Lastly, Star Wars video games are flying off the shelves. The proof is in the numbers. The studio entertainment segment reported quarterly operating income 87% higher than Q4 of 2014, parks and resorts operating income grew 23%, and consumer products/interactive media reported growth of 22%. The impressive growth in all three segments can be directly attributed to Star Wars release. As long as Disney's entertainment segment, which contains brands such as Lucasfilm, Marvel, and Pixar, keeps producing compelling movies, the other segments will reap the benefits. I was blown away at the pipeline of future movies listed in the conference call. I counted over 15 movies planned for the next 3 years, including, 4 Star Wars movies (the 2 remaining sequels and 2 stand-alone films), Frozen 2, Civil War: Iron Man vs. Captain America, and a new Pirates of the Caribbean. As I have stated in previous articles, my investing strategy is to take advantage of market selloffs and overreactions to transitory issues to buy companies with strong fundamentals and future growth prospects. It just so happens that both aforementioned forces are dragging Disney's shares down at the same time. Disney's phenomenal content and proactive management team are the main reasons why I believe the current issues are transitory and easily solvable. Thanks to its diversified business model, the company as a whole continues to perform like a well-oiled machine. Any losses experienced by the media segment will be more than offset by the other segments of the business while Disney adapts to the changing environment as it has done many times over the past century. Disney has a forward P/E of around 16. This is roughly in line with the P/E of the S&P 500 and the entertainment industry . I would argue that a phenomenal growth company such as Disney should trade at a premium to the market and its industry. Disney has grown earnings at 12% compounded annually for the past 10 years and is projected to experience similar growth for the next 5 years. This gives Disney a PEG of a little over 1.3, which is more than fair. Disney's current P/E is at the midpoint of its historical range for the past 5 years. In conclusion, Disney appears to be slightly undervalued to fairly valued when you compare its P/E to the market, its industry, its historical averages, and its growth rate. Disney's balance sheet is still not overleveraged by any means. The company's debt-to-total assets ratio is only 24%, leaving it enough borrowing capacity to pursue many strategic options. However, more debt does not need to be added unless a major acquisition is pursued because Disney generates an impressive amount of cash flow. Over $6.5 billion of free cash flow was generated by the business in 2015. This represents the cash left over after working capital requirements and capital expenditures. This excess cash can (and is) being used to repurchase shares, increase the dividend, and pursue other growth opportunities. Management is doing a fine job of effectively investing the capital that is provided to them. ROE was 17.2% and ROA was 9.5%, respectively, for 2015. Management's ability to achieve high returns on the capital invested is what ultimately drives earnings growth and thus value for the long-term shareholder. My reverse discounted cash flow model (pictured on the left) shows that a $95 share price (my purchase price) implies 2% sales growth forever and a slight decline in margins over the next 10 years. Two percent sales growth is usually the assumption made for companies that have reached a terminal state and have very limited growth opportunities. As stated earlier, I believe Disney is far from reaching this business stage because of its pipeline of movies, capacity for more worldwide parks and resorts, and opportunities for further brand acquisitions. Although a temporary margin decline is possible as Disney adapts to a new age of streaming and on-demand content, I believe margins will return to historical levels as Disney finds new ways to monetize its content and operations in the other segments continue to improve. More realistic, yet still conservative in my opinion, assumptions are made in my base case scenario, pictured on the far right. This scenario assumes sales growth of 5% for the next 3 years (in line with the average sales growth for the past 10 years), 4% for the next 3 years, and 2% thereafter. It also assumes operating margins remain constant at 25%. This scenario yields a fair value of $122 a share. In conclusion, Disney appears to be slightly undervalued when you consider the growth catalysts, rock solid balance sheet, impressive cash flow generation, management's ability to invest capital at high returns, and the company's sustainable competitive advantage. At the worse, you are buying Disney at a fair price. I am always willing to buy a wonderful company at a fair price because wonderful companies seldom sell at fair prices. It is not prudent to blindly buy your entire position at once without taking a look at the charts. I utilize technical analysis to ensure that my cost basis is as low as possible, and future return is as high as possible. I also never buy all of my desired position at once so that I am able to use excess cash to lower my cost basis if the stock drops significantly below my initial purchase price. I also like technical analysis because it presents facts that cannot be disputed. This is contrary to fundamental analysis, which is oftentimes extremely subjective. Disney's two-year chart (pictured above) tells me that a long-term uptrend was broken in August, when Disney plummeted below its 200-day moving average (red circle). A broken trend is a powerful force, and oftentimes signals the start of a new trend. A new bearish trend has been established because Disney has made a slightly lower high and slightly lower low (black circles). Disney faces strong resistance around $120 (top blue line), and strong support at around $90 (bottom blue line). Although Disney has rebounded sharply off its 52-week low of $88.25 made in February, I would be skeptical of this rally for a couple of reasons. The S&P 500 is currently overbought and encountering resistance at the 200-day moving average. More chatter about global growth concerns, Fed tightening, or oil going to $10 could easily cause a market selloff, which would definitely drag Disney lower. Also, the trend for Disney is neutral at best, and a retest of $88 or a new low seems more likely than a breakout to new highs. Although Disney is a wonderful company that is undervalued at current levels, the technical picture and macroeconomic backdrop does not look great. That is why I would suggest waiting for a market wide selloff before establishing a substantial position. I think it is okay to buy a small amount at these levels because there is a chance that Disney has bottomed and the market is going to break out to new highs. However, it would be smart to keep some powder dry just in case the stock moves lower. If Disney is able to stay above key support levels at $90-88 during the next inevitable market wide pullback, I would recommend accumulating a large amount of shares.
