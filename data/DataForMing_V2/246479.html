Intel: Reasons To Curb Your Enthusiasm As 2016 Looks Like Another Yawner - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel forecasts mid-single digit sales increase for 2016, the same as the 2015 prediction. Almost all the sales increase will come from Data Center Group (DCG). Apparently 3D NAND and 3D Xpoint are 2017 or 2018 products. Client Computing Group (CCG) sales may be flat in 2016. On Nov. 19th Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) held its annual Investor Meeting (NYSE: IM ) where it outlined last year's results and forecasted next year's. Overall the new version (lots of blue charts) looks a lot like the old version with a few exceptions. Last year for example wearables (who can forget Brian Krzanich's smart bracelet ?) was highlighted while this year not a mention. That is probably a good thing since Intel and wearables do not compute. Another missing item (actually two items) was CFO Stacy Smith's haikus, probably a sign of more seriousness after 2015's lackluster year compared to 2014's IM projections. Stacy Smith CFO Intel Corporation Nov. 20th 2014 1. Data Center Group (DCG) will represent 80% of revenue growth not leaving much for anything else. If we reverse engineer the revenue projections for 2016 we start with mid-single digit growth over 2015. So let's say 5% with revenue being about $58B (1.05 X $55.2B for 2015). That makes the revenue increase $2.8B for 2016. But according to Stacy Smith DCG revenues will be up mid-teens (15%) from 2015 when they will do about $16B. So 2016 DCG revenue at $18.4B is a $2.4B increase out of a $2.8B increase for the total company. That leaves $400M for everything else. That means Client Computing Group, IoT, memory, NAND and software sales will not being going up much if at all. BK says that mobile sales through the third quarter 2015 were about 26M units. With one quarter to go it looks very unlikely that sales will match last year's 41 M units. Of course this is a good thing since Intel has lost more than $7B on mobile chips the last few years so fewer sales would result in fewer money-losing sales incentives, a.k.a contra-revenue. In the 5 IM presentations I could not find a reference to 3D NAND. 3D xpoint NAND yes but not the old-fashioned floating gate 3D NAND although Intel claims it is shipping a 3.5TB version now. Perhaps it is being overshadowed by the 3D Xpoint and didn't deserve mention. But based upon the sales breakdown from No. 1 above there does not seem much room for old fashioned 3D NAND sales in 2016 making it a 2017 product at the earliest. 4. Is 3D Xpoint realistically a 2018 product? 3D Xpoint has garnered a lot of attention since it was announce in July. But according to Diane Bryant, VP of theData Center Group, 3D Xpoint will be "sampling" in 2016. Not sampling Q1 or H1 but just "2016" and this after BK stated in the Q3 conference call Oct. 13 that samples would ship this year. So the delivery is already slipping which if true probably means high-volume, high-margin, high-profit commercial shipments will not occur until 2018. According to partner Micron's CFO Ernie Maddock on Sept. 8th at the Citi Global Technology Conference regarding 3D Xpoint: "We're really - we're pleased to bring the first new memory technology in 25 years to the market, we're happy to do it with a partner like Intel, obviously it's brand new. So in terms of I have been asked a lot of questions today about what do I think about 2017 or 2018 or 2019 and the reality is when you're doing something that's brand new and you have had the first point in the technology curve you don't know a lot of the answers, so we're pretty happy and clearly understands sort of the uses for the products here in the short term. We have to get more experience with the technology, figure out what can be done from a cost perspective, which in turn drives market penetration or market applicability. So this will be a story to unfold. But I can foresee in two or three years that representing a reasonably significant amount of our bit output if things go the way we might expect." 5. Increasing capex to $10B in 2016 will cut down on free cash flow. In 2015 Intel cut capex to about $7.5B and for 2016 is estimating $10 billion so free cash flow could be affected significantly. This also may effect stock buybacks which in the last four quarters has only reduced the share count by 1.4% even with the reduced capex. I have been critical of CEO Brian Krzanich many times including this article " Intel: Time For Some New Management " and I'm not alone. Motley Fool had a piece on Krzanich and so did Fortune . Basically my argument against BK is lack of profit progress. There is always lots of talk about future profits but nothing happens. This chart is one Intel management throws out there every year to show what a great job they are doing. I don't question Intel's technical prowess - they are very good, maybe the best. But as an investor I want to know when that prowess turns into bottom line profits. Until it does this chart is meaningless. Who cares about a 3.5 year node lead when your profits look like the following table. This is not a history that inspires either confidence or a huge PE. I have written 10 articles about Intel since last February, each one cautioning investors about investing before Intel shows some bottom line progress. So far I have been right with Intel's price about the same as 10 months ago. For 2016 the concensus analysts profit projection is about $2.38 which looks a lot like the last five years. I don't see anything in the investor meeting presentations that would make me believe it will be any different. So until Intel shows some real progress, i.e. significantly improved profits, I rate them a hold. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
