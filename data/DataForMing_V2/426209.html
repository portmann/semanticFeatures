VOX: Do It Yourself And Save - Vanguard Telecom Services ETF (NYSEARCA:VOX) | Seeking Alpha Telecoms and Vanguard sounds like a great mix; however, investors should look at what they are actually buying. With two holdings that comprise 43% of the fund, an investor could attempt to replicate this investment. The telecom sector faces many risks including falling profits, rising expenses, and heavy debt loads. Telecoms and Vanguard sounds like a great mix; however, investors should look at what they are actually buying with regards to the Vanguard Telecommunication Services ETF (NYSEARCA: VOX ). With only 30 total holdings, VOX is not the Vanguard ETF that investors have come to expect from the company. I believe that, in this rare case, an investor may be better served purchasing individual equities such as AT&T (NYSE: T ) or Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) to gain exposure to the telecom sector. This being said, the telecom sector has many risks which must be considered including falling profits, rising expenses, and heavy debt loads. According to Vanguard , VOX is a passively managed index fund that seeks to track the performance of the MSCI US Investable Market Index (IMI)/Telecommunication Services 25/50. VOX includes stocks of companies that provide telephone, data-transmission, cellular, or wireless communication services. The following chart shows average annual performance of the fund in comparison to the telecom index: An investor could easily be wooed into the fund simply by looking at these returns; however, this could be a mistake. Diving deeper into the data available for the fund, an investor will find that the ETF only has 30 holdings . This is uncharacteristic of Vanguard funds where the cost of the fund typically buys the investor over 200 equities in a single low cost package. Furthermore, the top 10 holdings comprise nearly 70% of the ETF. Here is were things get interesting. AT&T is the funds heaviest weighted equity at 22.3% of the fund and Verizon is the second heaviest at 21.2% of the fund. The third largest holding is CenturyLink (NYSE: CTL ) at 4.5%. Brad Sorenson of Charles Schwab places an underperform rating on the telecom sector because of three key risks: Falling profits, rising expenses, and heavy debt loads. Sorenson finds that the sector's wireless growth is both its biggest strength and weakness. Sorenson notes that while there is a tremendous increase in wireless demand, there is a significant decrease in pricing power and profits. This is due to increasing competition between wireless carriers and budget conscious consumers who are beginning to favor less expensive contract free wireless plans. Furthermore, wireless growth is increasing expenses for providers due to a need to upgrade equipment and labor. Finally, Sorenson highlights that the telecom sector has taken on tremendous amounts of debt to finance infrastructure improvements. As a result, the telecom sector now has the highest debt / equity ratio of any non financial sector. Sorenson notes that this could be problematic for the sector when interest rates go up. Clearly, an investor seeking exposure to telecoms must acknowledge the significant risks that the sector faces. If an investor still wants exposure to the telecom sector, they should take it from Vanguard itself, which places over 43% of its VOX investor's money in AT&T and Verizon. One or a combination of these two equities could be a better investment than the ETF going forward. Essentially, investors in VOX are paying a .10% expense ratio to hold AT&T, Verizon, and a small assortment of other telecom companies. While this expense ratio is of course very low, it still represents a $10 per year charge for every $10,000 invested in the fund. Furthermore, while the fund has been doing a great job at tracking its index, it has not been keeping up with its top two holdings over different periods of time. The following chart shows VOX in comparison to AT&T and Verizon over the past year: Over the past year AT&T has provided a significant advantage to investors of 8.64% gains over VOX and 6.39% gains over Verizon. Over the past five years, Verizon has provided an advantage to investors of 11.25% gains over VOX and 14% gains over AT&T. Clearly, VOX has provided investors with sizable gains over both periods; however, owners of just AT&T would be ahead over the past year and owners of VZ would be ahead over the past five years. Standard and Poors currently has a "Buy" rating on AT&T with a $42 12 month price target and a "Hold" rating on Verizon with a $51 12 month price target. Angelo Zino of S&P highlights that wireless growth for both companies will be constrained because of consumer sentiment shift towards value service providers; however, wireline should continue to be profitable for both due to cost cutting and merger synergies. AT&T currently has a 16.67 PE and a 12.98 forward PE. In comparison Verizon has a lower PE of 11.50 but has a 12.52 forward PE. Investors currently long VOX or considering purchasing it should definitely reassess their positions. With only 30 total holdings, two of which comprising 43% of the fund, an investor may be better served purchasing either AT&T, Verizon, or both if they want to gain exposure to the telecom sector. This being said, the telecom investor must be wary of the sector's many risks including falling profits, rising expenses, and heavy debt loads.
