Apple In The Enterprise: IBM Tries To Make The Case - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha IBM has deployed Mac OS X and iOS devices to 130,000 users within the company, all supported by a mere 24 IT personnel. IBM has become convinced that TCO for Apple Macs is lower than for Windows. At a conference for Mac IT professionals on October 14, IBM (NYSE: IBM ) shared its experience deploying Mac and iOS devices into its 500,000+ Windows-centric workforce. IBM pointed out that a staff of only 24 IT Mac OS X and iOS specialists are supporting 130,000 users. This ratio (5,400:1) is far higher than the industry average and represents a significant cost saving. The company isn't merely deploying Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) devices, IBM has become an Apple evangelist. In a recent article on Apple in the enterprise, I cautioned investors not to get excited yet. Apple CEO Tim Cook had announced that the company made $25 billion in revenue from sales to the enterprise in the past 12 months. The reason for this caution was that Cook's number represented a single data point, and investors couldn't derive from this whether the revenue trajectory was up or down. As I pointed out in my article, much of the available data is sparse and anecdotal. Apple needs to start breaking out revenue for the enterprise in its quarterly reports by way of demonstrating its seriousness. One of the areas that seemed murkiest was total cost of ownership (TCO) for Apple devices. It was at the JAMF Nation User Conference that this issue was addressed head on by none other than IBM's Fletcher Previn, who is VP of Workplace-as-a-Service. JAMF Software makes an enterprise device management suite that IBM is using for its Apple device roll out. In July, an IBM video message by Chief Information Officer Jeff Smith indicated that the company could end up purchasing 150,000-200,000 Macs annually. IBM is expected to deploy 50,000 Macs by year's end. Its interest in the Mac was certainly suggestive of a cost benefit, but there was still no solid data. At the JAMF conference, Previn provided that data. By using JAMF software, employees are empowered to do their own setups and install centrally managed and approved software. This kind of self service has the potential to turn into a debacle, but it appears to be working well for IBM's deployment as well as ongoing support. Previn pointed out 5% of Mac users call the help desk while 40% of Windows PC users do. Previn also pointed out that the user to IT support ratio of 5,400:1 is far above the industry average. Gartner believes that the ideal ratio is 70:1, Previn noted, while the industry average is 242:1. As much as I would like to take Mr. Previn's statement at face value, I wanted to see just how much of a cost advantage Macs might have compared to a Windows PC. I put together a simple spreadsheet model for TCO over three years, in which the key ingredients are the purchase price, a reliability premium, and IT support. Figuring out the reliability premium, basically an insurance cost for 3 years, is fairly easy for the $2,000 MacBook Pro. It's just the cost of AppleCare+, $349, which covers the device against failure for 3 years. To find reliability data for the MacBook compared to other laptops, I had to go back to a Computerworld article from 2009. The failure rate of 17% the article asserts for MacBook does correlate well with the AppleCare+ purchase price since .17*2000 = $340. Probably, MacBooks are a little more reliable now. For the Windows notebook, I used a failure rate of 15%, also a slight improvement over the range of 15.6-16.8% noted in the article. The labor rate is a ballpark estimate, fully burdened and inclusive of benefits such as medical and retirement pension. As the reader can see, even with the much lower assumed IT support, the MacBook doesn't quite achieve the lower TCO of the Windows notebook. The simple model indicates that costs are roughly comparable, and TCO advantage can swing either for or against the Mac depending on assumptions about labor rates or initial purchase price. IBM's assertion about Macs having lower TCO might be true, but it just isn't jumping out at me from this simple model. This could be because the company is spending more on the Windows notebook, or because its IT labor rates are higher, or because of some other factor not accounted for in the simple model. IBM may be onto something. It would be nice if I could write: the Mac TCO cost advantage will translate into increased market share for Mac in the enterprise and be a tailwind for Apple. Only I don't think it's so simple. For one thing, I try to be a bit more quantitative than buzzwords such as "tailwind" allow. The argument for a lower Apple device TCO probably has to be made on a case-by-case basis. For some companies with cost structures similar to IBM, it might well be true, but for others, it might not. But the crux of the matter is that I'm not convinced that corporate IT departments necessarily want their users to be much less dependent on them, or that they want to reduce their headcount by a factor of 5,400/242 (22.3). Corporate IT departments have become bureaucracies. And as we all know, bureaucracies have a life of their own. It will be an uphill battle to convince corporate IT that it should spend much more money on hardware and much less money on personnel, especially if the cost benefit is marginal. Apple and IBM, along with partners such as JAMF Software, will need to make a better case than they have made so far. All the more reason for Apple to be more transparent about its enterprise business. Then, investors can see if this "tailwind" translates into meaningful revenue gains. I continue to be bullish on Apple and regard it as a buy, but not because of Apple's enterprise business. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
