GM And Ford For Dividend-Income Investors: What's The Catch? - General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) | Seeking Alpha Investors love Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ). The strong brand and expected future growth makes raising debt easy. Tesla needs billions ($2 billion in a share sale ) in capital costs to roll out the Model 3. This makes its 30x price to book ratio forgivable. Does that mean traditional auto makers are cheap? General Motors Company (NYSE: GM ) has a 1.15x P/B while the P/B for Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F ) is 1.77x. GM and Ford are especially attractive for income investors. GM's dividend yields nearly 5 percent, more than Ford's 4.55 percent yield. GM and Ford both dwarf Tesla's free cash flow, but in different ways. Tesla's FCF is understandably negative $466.5M. GM's FCF plunged to $2.45B while Ford kept its level consistent in the last six years. F Free Cash Flow (Quarterly) data by YCharts The market fails to recognize Ford's discipline in rolling out new models like the aluminum-bodied F-150 truck or the reliable Focus and Fusion models. Conversely, General Motors is spending $1B for Cruise Automation, closing the deal on May 19. The company clearly has high expenses ahead as it aims to update its technology to support automated driving. GM's payout ratio is normalizing towards the 2012-2014 levels at 21.9 percent. This suggests the company will sustain its dividend, which currently yields 5 percent. F Payout Ratio (TTM) data by YCharts The market being a voting machine in the short run, does not believe in GM's future prospects. Fearing a recession and a drop in consumer discretionary spending, investors believe sales for automobiles will fall. Investors buying GM or Ford must have a time frame in years, not months. Automated driving is still years away while electric cars are still an expensive fad. Gas prices are low enough that paying the premium for an EV is still not justifiable for most consumers. A tax credit might lower the premium paid for using an EV. This credit could get cancelled any time. Consumers who think they will get a $7,500 tax credit might get less than that if the credit is wound down by 2018. Tesla's 500,000 reservation count for Tesla 3 is admirable, but it will only add up to a small percent of total market share. In April, GM's monthly sales grew to 200,656 units. Sales grew from higher demand for Buick (up 13 percent), GMC, and Chevrolet. If this trend continued indefinitely, GM's sale for its premium Buick brand will only boost average selling price and its profitability. GM is not ignoring the EV market. Consumers agree the 2016 Volt has potential. Sales doubled from 2015 numbers (1,983 vs. 905 units). Car and Driver ranked the model four stars. Its 2017 Volt model is winning praise from critics. Master Herald likes its low operating cost and low price. Expect the stock to underperform for GM (and Ford too). The traditional automobile sector is out of favor. That is okay for investors who prefer boring high dividend-yielding stocks. Investors get paid in the meantime while waiting for GM's stock to go up.
