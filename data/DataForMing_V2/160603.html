Disney Is Striking Out On Its Own - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Disney's long-term growth promise is in its Consumer Products Division. With Infinity, the company is sidestepping its traditional dependence on licensees such as Hasbro. Eighteen months ago, I wrote an article headed "Disney - is Infinity leading the way?" The fact that Disney (NYSE: DIS ) had for the first time in history managed a toy-related product soup to nuts rather than just licensing it out to the Mattels (NASDAQ: MAT ) or Hasbros (NASDAQ: HAS ) of this world, led to the question whether we were looking at a game changer. In the case of Infinity, Disney had designed the product, manufactured it, created the packaging and product designs, managed the supply chain, created the advertising and promotional back-up, and then sold the product directly to the major retailers - which it had never done before. Are we now, eighteen months later, closer to the answer to the question then asked? Before getting to this point, it is probably helpful to look at Disney's businesses. The company has four businesses - Media, Parks and Resorts, Studio and Consumer Products. This is how sales developed over the past nine years: The Media Networks segment includes broadcast and cable television networks, television production operations, television distribution, domestic television stations and radio networks and stations. While now the largest sales generator, the outlook for all activities associated with television is not particularly rosy. According to the most recent "Global Entertainment and Media Outlook" from Pricewaterhouse Coopers, North American subscription TV penetration is expected to fall from 79.8 percent in 2012 to 78.1 percent in 2016. Parks and Resorts include the Walt Disney World Resort in Florida, the Disneyland Resort in California, Aulani, a Disney Resort & Spa in Hawaii, the Disney Vacation Club, the Disney Cruise Line and Adventures by Disney. The company also manages and owns 51% in Disneyland Paris, 48% in Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and 43% in Shanghai Disney Resort. The company also licenses the operations of the Tokyo Disney Resort in Japan. The bulk of this segment is the various theme parks and this is how visitor numbers developed: While basically flat in terms of visitor numbers, the revenue derived from the parks grew between 2013 and 2014 mainly on the strength of higher ticket prices in the U.S. - a strategy which will get you just so far before it backfires on you. However, the company pins its hopes for future growth on the forthcoming opening of the Shanghai in Spring next year. The location, Shanghai, is extremely well chosen in that it is an urban center of major proportions. In addition, the six already established Chinese theme parks are located in very different parts of the country - in Beijing on one hand and the wider Shenzhen/Guangdong area on the other. With a very successful park already in operation in Hong Kong, in spitting distance to Shenzhen where several Chinese competitors are located, it is reasonable to assume that Disney has found the key to the heart of the Chinese consumer. In fact, half of Disney Hong Kong's visitors are from mainland China, presumably mainly from the Guangdong area. In short, Disney is banking on China to provide the growth for its park business which it can no longer expect from other parts of the world. However, thereby lies a problem. If as a foreign and particularly a U.S. entity, you put all your eggs into the Chinese basket, a centrally-directed country that is likely to get into a collision course with the United States over the long haul, you are asking for trouble. The Studio Entertainment segment produces live action and animated motion pictures, direct-to-video content, musical recordings and live stage plays. The company distributes films primarily under the Walt Disney Pictures, Pixar, Marvel, Touchstone and Lucasfilm banners. The company produces and distributes Indian movies through its UTV banner. This is one area which is really vulnerable. Incidentally, the hybrids follow toy seasonality in that they are very prominent during the fourth quarter and then take a back seat during the first nine months of the year. The route Disney is taking with Infinity is doubly interesting given its long-term relationship with Hasbro, its main licensee now for action figures but next year also for fashion dolls. Hybrids are not an island in the toy space; hybrids compete directly with traditional toys. In the case of Infinity, the buyers believe that at least half of its business comes from the likes of Hasbro's action figures. This situation is likely to get even more intense in that Hasbro is the action figure licensee for Star Wars - backed by the blockbuster movie "The Force Awakens" in December this year - whereas Infinity, at the same time, will also go to town with its own competing Star Wars figures. This is the Infinity version of the forthcoming StarWars personae: Whilst Hasbro presented this figure from Star Wars - The Force Awakens - at San Diego Comic Con between July 9 and 12: (click to enlarge) As if all this was not enough to fascinate the buyers, there is now also the story of Tsum Tsum Babies. Tsum Tsum is a straight toy, a plush product and was first launched by Disney last year in Japan, where it proved to be extremely successful. Disney then brought the product to the United States, where it began selling it from its own stores at its theme parks and cruise lines. Again, it did very well, and Disney decided this Spring to bring it to the wider marketplace on its own, again not going the license route. Tsum Tsum Babies now has an endcap at Target which sells out as fast as it can be refilled: The third instance where Disney now appears to take a much more active role than what you would expect from a normal license arrangement is Playmation, Hasbro's new outdoor range - basically Nerf on steroids - which is getting ready to launch in October. Playmation is a new toy-game hybrid combining active play with video-game mechanics. You can now order the range on the Disney Store website. In addition, Disney is giving in-store demos in its North American stores and has begun to accept pre-orders for the toys. This suggests an arrangement between Disney and Hasbro which is very different from a simple license deal. Disney is obviously taking the lead on this one and Hasbro is only getting part of the deal. I spoke with a few national buyers at the major retailers both in the U.S. and in Europe and the consensus of opinion seems to be that: Disney is clearly gearing up to paddle its own boat in the Consumer Products space and is likely to rely less and less on the license route to bring new products to market; and while Disney is unlikely to drop its license partners - notably Hasbro - in the foreseeable future, it is probable that the company will in due course decide not to renew expiring licenses but to take these product opportunities under its own banner. In the final analysis, if it is Disney's ambition to significantly grow its Consumer Products business, there is no faster way to do this than by taking a licensed product in-house. Instead of the license fee of say 12% flowing into sales, all of a sudden this becomes 100%. In addition, it is likely that Disney would do a better job marketing and selling a toy than the average licensee.
