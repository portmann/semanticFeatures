Intel Cuts Contra Revenue, Tablet Sales Plummet - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel reported flat revenue growth y/y and a 6% y/y decline in net income. Client Computing Group revenue declined 7% y/y on unit declines of 14% y/y in laptops and 15% in desktops. Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) 2015 Q3 earnings offered some hope for investors in the form of improved operating margin for the Client Computing Group (CCG) that is the combination of the PC group and the mobile devices group as of the beginning of the year. Some of this margin improvement appears to have been due to a reduction in contra revenue subsidies for Intel's tablet processors. Tablet processor sales fell 39% y/y as a result. If investors needed proof of my thesis that Intel cannot be cost competitive with ARM processors of equivalent capability, Intel's Q3 earnings report provides that proof. The truth is out there, but it still takes a little digging to find it. As I did for my Q2 Intel earnings article, I've plotted revenue and earnings for the PC Client Group (PCCG) before it was merged with the Mobile and Communications Group (MCG) on a quarterly basis for 2014 and the combined Client Computing Group for 2015. As before, the PCCG data is from historical SEC filings from 2014, not the restated results for CCG. The basic takeaway here is that MCG effectively contributes zero revenue to the combined organization while at the same time markedly reducing operating income. CCG operating margin also suffered drastically compared to the PCCG: For Q3, operating income and margin both jumped for CCG, a good sign that either mobile related costs were coming under control or that contra revenue was being curtailed. However, it's difficult without additional data mining to determine which is more important. I've prepared a third chart that looks at operating cost for PCCG in 2014 (once again based on historical, not restated data), and CCG in 2015. Intel doesn't provide a breakdown of operating costs by group, so this is an estimate that assumes that group gross margins for a given quarter can be approximated by Intel's reported corporate gross margin for the quarter. This is probably not a bad approximation. After estimating gross profit for the groups, operating cost is calculated from subtracting the operating income from gross profit. This yields the chart below, showing the difference in operating costs for PCCG in 2014 and CCG in 2015. For an organization that's reasonably stable in composition, operating costs should be relatively constant as they are for PCCG in 2014. Operating costs took a big jump for the combined CCG starting in Q1, but this was to be expected. MCG had posted a $1.1 billion operating loss on negative revenue of -$6 million in Q4 2014. The Q1 jump of over $1 billion in operating cost for CCG was to be expected. Since then, Intel has been paring the losses down, saving a cumulative $481.8 million in operating costs for CCG through restructuring. Strictly speaking, this shouldn't have anything to do with contra revenue. During the conference call, Intel management indicated that it was 75% along on its goal to save $800 million this year in mobile related costs, or $600 million worth. This suggests that about $118 million was saved in contra revenue. Making the approximation that revenue from the 17 million tablet processors that Intel sold in Q1 and Q2 was essentially zero, (due to contra revenue), then this indicates that the 8 million tablet processors that Intel reports it sold in Q3 garnered $118 million (or an additional $118 million, if the previous cost wasn't zero), or about $15 apiece. This would still represent a significant discount from the tray price of a typical Atom X5 series processor of about $25. But even that discount wasn't enough to keep INTC from suffering a 39% y/y decline in tablet unit shipments. This is the final confirmation of my thesis that Intel's x86 architecture is fundamentally disadvantaged in cost relative to ARM. Only by means of the draconian contra revenue scheme was Intel able to meet its goal of selling 40 million-plus tablet processors last year. As the contra revenue subsidy has been reduced (or perhaps eliminated), sales have fallen dramatically. Other factors have probably weighed on Intel's tablet sales as well, such as the release by Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) of the new iPhone 6s featuring Apple's custom A9 system on chip (SOC) which appears to outperform any Atom processor (including X5 and X7) Intel currently makes. In addition, other ARM processor vendors such as Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) and MediaTex have come out with or have plans for processors that also may rival or exceed Intel's best mobile processors. Despite a few wins here and there, Intel is well on its way to becoming irrelevant in smartphones, the most important market in mobile devices. There's a reason that Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) chose Qualcomm for its flagship Lumia 950 and 950 XL smartphones. Intel had nothing that was even close to good enough, even for free. Intel's decision to put off until 2017 10 nm production is another nail in the coffin of the company's mobile ambitions. Funded by such well-heeled customers as Apple, TSMC (NYSE: TSM ) is not waiting while Intel takes a breather. As I've pointed out previously , TSMC's stated intention to start 10 nm production by the end of 2016 should be taken very seriously. I believe that Apple will be very motivated to team up with TSMC on 10 nm in an attempt to get ahead of Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ). It may seem that I overemphasize mobile, but the continuing declines in the PC industry overall as well as the declines in Intel's PC unit shipments should be motivation for Intel to make itself relevant to the mobile space. CCG revenue was down 7% y/y, while desktop and laptop shipments were down 15% and 14%, respectively. Intel's total revenue and earnings were only spared negative y/y growth by continued strong growth in the Data Center Group. Last quarter, I called Intel the " BlackBerry (NASDAQ: BBRY ) of Semiconductors" and declared the company a short opportunity on the basis of its clueless management and the unrealistic expectations of its shareholders. There are signs that Intel investors are starting to wake up to what the current Intel management is doing to this great American company. Following the earnings call, Intel shares fell after hours. The continuing declines in PCs despite (or in my view because of) the Windows 10 roll out and the steep decline in tablet sales had to be a splash of cold water in the face of Intel investors. I wish I could say the same about Intel's management. CEO Krzanich and his cohorts continue to maintain the facade that Intel has a viable mobile strategy. And Intel is still "on track" to deliver SoFIA LTE on the 14 nm process in the second half of 2016, as if it wouldn't be totally obsolete by then. In this case, staying on track is the last thing Intel should be doing. Intel needs to stop propping up the antiquated x86 architecture and adopt ARM for mobile devices. The irony of Intel's current approach to mobile is that the combination of Intel's process leadership and the ARM v8 architecture could make Intel the unquestioned leader in mobile devices. As long as Intel is burdened by its current management, I continue to regard Intel as a short opportunity. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
