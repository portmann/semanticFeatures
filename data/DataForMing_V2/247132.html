Intel's Data Center Group Positioned Strongly For The Future - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel's datacenter is uniquely positioned to grow its business along multiple-axises. It's not only the potential to sell more to conventional vendors, but now the discussion has been centered around C-RAN (cloud radio access network) silicon opportunities. Since we already know that cloud will grow gangbusters, and Intel has a ton of new products to add to that effort, the focus then shifts to incremental upside. The good news, there's even more growth potential than I had initially anticipated given the rapid adoption of major telecoms for C-RAN. As such, I believe Intel will emerge as the largest vendor for network silicon in a relatively short period of time. My price target could end up being too conservative. Diane Bryant, Senior VP and General Manager of the Data Center Group, made a fairly compelling presentation at this year's Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) shareholder conference. Of course, to be fair, this is the shining symbol of light for Intel as the consumer business is slowly transitioning into a GDP-comparable growth rate business, whereas the Data Center continues to sprout additional legs for growth. Of course, I'm not saying that growth rates will accelerate, but I do believe the long-term CAGR assumptions could potentially accelerate. After all, Diane makes some well-supported claims in her most recent presentation. The adoption of cloud computing is starting to happen across all of the end-user segments for Intel. However, the most interesting takeaway from her presentation, when pertaining specifically to the enterprise, was the rapid deployment of the cloud in all of the segments (Communications, HPC, and Enterprise IT). In the next shareholder meeting (next year in 2016) they're not going to break out HPC revenue separately, but rather redistribute HPC into the three main categories of cloud, enterprise and communications. The communication component, i.e. the network virtualization of base stations, is absolutely critical for ascertaining the momentum of the segment, which I will get into a little later. But basically the stagnation of revenue, which we've witnessed over the past three years, will no longer continue. Intel is starting to push the pedal down on volume growth within the enterprise segment, which has way better margins than the consumer group. They've also observed trends in which their big 7 cloud vendors are moving up the Xeon-SKU stack, which implies 10% improvement to the ASPs of just the enterprise-cloud segment. So, while workloads are transitioning away from the enterprise into the cloud, the cloud offsets this impact through pricing and usage increases. Much of the growth in IaaS is through consumer-facing applications, which they believe will compose an even larger percentage of the total workload mix going forward. From my perspective, this makes sense, as mobile apps have grown at a torrid pace, and quick implementation of updates and new software offerings rely on a pure cloud, or hybrid cloud implementation. However, a lot of these start-ups don't have their own IT department when they're in the initial growth phase and are often locked into a vendor at some later point. Hence, start-ups that had to build their own IT like Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) and Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) are becoming increasingly less common. In a sense, this pattern of rapid application mobile deployment will likely continue without the need of having IT resources on hand, and as such, it's also worth noting that the growth of cloud applications is how Intel directly benefits from mobile without having meaningful market share in the baseband modem/CPU space. After all, servers are what communicate to clients on mobile, so if mobile grows, so does the enterprise. The growth in consumer versus business applications will continue. Hence, some of the larger name software vendors that are positioned in front of commercial end users have become a smaller component of aggregated software revenue. I think this dynamic creates unique opportunities for those more interested in software. However, there's a more predictable path to benefiting directly from consumer apps via a direct ownership position in the only major hardware provider in the space. In fact, Intel might as well be labeled a monopolist in this segment, except they don't charge so much at the toll booth that it creates competitive pressure from wannabe market entrants. So, what's different with this presentation when compared to the data center day earlier in 2015? Well, a lot actually. Because, at the prior datacenter day, Intel didn't dive into much detail on which base stations would eventually migrate over into its hardware ecosystem. Well, now we know, and it's not just China Mobile (NYSE: CHL ) attempting to integrate virtual networks to save on base station space footprint. But now Verizon (NYSE: VZ ), AT&T (NYSE: T ), SK Telecom and Vodafone (NASDAQ: VOD ) also are jumping on the boat. In the United States that represents around 70% of the telecom market transitioning away from ASICs-based packet processing over into Intel-based hardware, i.e. 233.4 million subscribers. Vodafone has a global subscriber base that spans from Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa and small parts of South America. It's like the Dutch East India company - crazy stuff. But basically Vodafone has 454 million mobile subscribers as of their most recent quarterly conference. Furthermore, this is distributed across the entire world, which 185 million come from just India alone. SK Telecom, China Mobile, and Telefonica (NYSE: TEF ) have 27 million, 815.38 million and 274.5 million subscribers, respectively. In total, deployment of network-based cloud should reach 1.8 billion-plus mobile subscribers globally over the next five-year timeframe. According to Statista, there were 4.43 billion mobile subscribers in the world, and of that amount Intel's base station footprint will likely reach 1.8 billion of those subscribers. Of course, this is based on 2015 figures and is not inclusive of forecast assumptions or partnerships with more telecoms down the road. As of right now, it seems Intel will penetrate into about 40% of the base station TAM over the next five years, which puts it on path to generate $7.2 billion of the base station silicon revenue of the $18 billion addressable market when based on their earlier datacenter presentation. Of course, Sandra Rivera (GM of Network Platform Group) mentions that this growth opportunity in the network silicon space is not included in the consolidated DCG CAGR assumption for the next five years. Given the fact that the DCG composes approximately 30.12% of consolidated revenue, and I project it will grow to $18.32 billion by FY 2016, the incremental $7.2 billion in annual revenue adds upside to the outlook. Furthermore $7.2 billion when distributed over five years could add an incremental $1.44 billion to the DCG growth. This implies that the DCG alone could accelerate its growth to 24% if we assume a rapid deployment phase in the FY 2016 timeframe. However, I think the ramp up of C-RAN (cloud radio access network) will happen more substantially in the 2017 timeframe based on commentary from China Mobile at a recent conference hosted by the Dell'Oro Group. In other words, worst-case scenario Intel has a phenomenal year. But the best case scenario equals a Hallyu-wood blockbuster year (a bit of Korean humor to lighten the mood). Anyhow, I continue to reiterate my high conviction buy recommendation and $42.87 price target. However, if the DCG produces blockbuster results as a result of C-RAN, I could see the stock reaching $45.16 over the next 12 to 14 months.
