How to Score Deep Discounts on Amazon with Warehouse Deals Here are the tools and resources that changed my financial life! I am a huge fan of shopping on Amazon, but especially Amazon warehouse deals! Â  I mentioned this little known section of Amazon before in one of my simple savings Sunday posts. Â Being a deal seeker, I try to find the greatest deals that I can wherever I shop. Â I am also an Amazon Prime member , so Amazon is really my one stop shop for many of my products. Â I learned about Amazon warehouse deals some time agoÂ when I was searching for a camera lens for my wife. Â If you know about photography, then you understand that camera lenses are expensive. Â I am not very savvy when it comes to the camera, so my wife told me what type of lens she wanted. Â With that information in hand, I was able to start my search. Â Here is my experience* with Amazon warehouse deals and why I think you should always check there for awesome deals. *My experience with warehouse deals was so positive, it’s one of the many ways I show you how to save on Amazon . You should check out this list for over 20 ways ! Amazon doesn’t really make it easy to find their warehouse deals section. Â If you just start searching in their main search bar on the homepage, then you probably won’t find the section. Â If you want to specifically search their warehouse deals, then head to this page . Â This is their main warehouse deals section. Â Now, anytime you search, you should see “Amazon Warehouse Deals” next to the search box, like shown below. You can find the warehouse deals when you are on a product page and you are checking the prices. Â You will see the new products first, but then you can find the warehouse deals. Â Click the link below to show a screenshot of an Amazon product page. Â It is easier to find warehouse deals when you click on the Used tab. Basically, warehouse deals consists of products that have been returned, damaged at the warehouse, used, and refurbished. Â These items just don’t meet Amazon’s “new” standard, so they list them here. Â They also have some new and open-boxed items, but they are less of these. Â If you are an Amazon Prime member, then you can get the same 2-day shipping on eligible items. Amazon thoroughly tests each product to make sure that it is still functional before listing back on sale. Â They even grade their items to help you find ones that you are willing to purchase. Â Some of their grading can be a little general, but if you shop there enough, you start to understand how they are doing it. Â Here are their product conditions or grades. New – This means that the product has not been opened, but the package has superficial damage. Â These offer new products with discounted prices because the shipping package was damaged. Like New – These are typical returns where the customer might pull the item out and then just return it. Â The packaging has been opened, but the product is in perfect working order. Â Amazon will also put some products that have some physical damage to the outer box of the factory sealed item. Very Good – The item has been tested and verified to work correctly. The item may have some cosmetic damage or blemishes. Good – Items are tested and verified in working order. They may be missing accessories or have large cosmetic damage. Acceptable – Items are still tested and verified in working order. Â There are signs of wear along with possible different packaging and could include third party accessories. I tend to only purchase items that are New, which are harder to find, Like New, or Very Good. Â I have purchased quite a few items from warehouse deals and never had an issue with them. Amazon still stands behind their return policy, so if you have any issues, then you need to call them up. Â When you see the items listed, they will have a little description hear them that talks about cosmetic damage and such like that. Â I have found that these are pretty general, but some are quite detailed. Â It really depends on the product. If you find something you like when shopping Amazon warehouse deals , then understand that they typically don’t have a lot of deep inventory. These are returns and damaged items, so they won’t have a lot of inventory. If you are waiting for it to go on sale, you might miss your chance to get the item. This is especially important when holiday shopping season comes around. When people ask me were to find great deals online, I typically tell them about warehouse deals. Â The majority of people I speak with have never heard of it, yet they have Amazon accounts. Â I think this is a great opportunity to find great deals on products that you want or need. Â Yes, you do have to be careful of what you order, but if you find the right product condition, then you will most likely be OK. Â Amazon has warehouse deals for many great and popular categories like consumer electronics , baby products , sports & outdoor , home & garden , shoes , and much more . You still get the same great service from Amazon, but you can save a good amount of money. When I bought the camera lens for my wife, I was able to save $75 off the regular price just because the shipping box was damaged. The lens had no issues and my wife loved the gift. I can’t complain there. Â The worst I have had was there was an accessory missing. Â Luckily, it only cost me about $5 for a replacement, so I considered that a win. Â Some products you can save 5% on, while others you can save 40% on. Â It really all depends on the item and how long Amazon has had it in their inventory. Â So, if you are looking for a good deal while shopping online, then check out Amazon warehouse deals ! Regular shoppers should be taking advantage of these deals. Yes, they can be hit or miss, but you’d never know unless you checked. Before I buy something, I will check the warehouse deal section just to be sure I can’t find something that’s been returned. You really never know what you might find. If you’re really lucky, then you might be able to find an Amazon coupon to go along with it for even more savings. Don’t forget about those little insta-click treasures! I'm a business owner, blogger, father, and husband. I used credit cards too much and found myself in over $50,000 in debt. I paid it off, started this blog, and my financial life has changed. I now talk about fighting debt and growing wealth here. I run a blog management company , along with another blog. It is Empowered Shopper , which helps people get information about products they want to buy. You can also check out Eyes on the Dollar , which is a great blog that I co-own. I’ve been checking the warehouse every time I need something after you posted about it last time.  Did you see this new prime box thing though?  Some products are prime eligible and some are prime box eligible?  But for prime box you have to pay for the shipment of the box.  It’s a bit confusing to me, but for now, I’m avoiding the box. Good to hear.  I think you are talking about Prime Pantry. I have a post coming up on that soon.  It is really easy to use.  They are really just household and non-perishable items that are not sold anywhere else on Amazon. You can only get them on Prime Pantry. I have yet to make it over there to check out some of the deals they have, but then again, I tend to avoid Amazon as it can be a time suck for me. I had no idea that Amazon offered this and I am glad that you have provided a review. As someone who worked in the customer service department of a well-known electronics company through college, I have always been scared of returns because no matter what people “say” is the problem, you will never truly know and I hate surprises. What a great find. Although… I’m not sure if this is a good or bad thing for me ðŸ˜‰ Looking forward to that Prime Pantry post. Thanks for sharing. September 22, 2014 at 5:01 pm — Reply Someone in a forum pointed out to me that there would be no manufacturers warranty with items from Amazon Warehouse Deals.  We’re in Canada and deal with Amazon.ca so maybe its different in the US? September 22, 2014 at 9:22 pm — Reply It depends on the item being sold.  Since not all items have even been used or damaged, you can still get a warranty on the items.  I have received a few items which just had box damage, but the item was fine.  I got a discount and the warranty was still intact. It’s the same search that Amazon’s site uses. It’s not weird. (please don’t put in links to sites like that either, it was removed due to the spammy nature) Perhaps a bit less enthusiasm.  Purchased an As New Lenova laptop and thought initially it was fine.  Did as many would do, spent a day installing software and transferring data.  Needed the laptop to replace an failed predecessor.  Then found Windows complaining Windows 8.1 license key invalid.  Contacted Amazon Warehouse to be told, this is normal and is part of what you get when you buy from Amazon Warehouse.  Interestingly, I asked where do they publish this as did not see this anywhere on the site or in the order.  After a few tense moments they offered some money, which is less than will cost to buy.  Pressed, why they do not send a valid license key as advertised.  Also enquired, if so common, why do they not get money back from the customer they purchased the laptop from to get money back.  To send back now will cost time I don’t have, so accepting the Amazon Warehouse discount was a mirage.  Be Warned, Amazon Warehouse do not seek to fulfil Amazon’s vision of being the Earth’s most customer-centric company.  Will be leaving Amazon as a seller of choice and only using them when/where have to….. Well that’s a crazy story to hear. I’m sorry you had problems with Amazon’s warehouse deals. I’ve never heard of them sending out bad license keys, then saying that’s how it’s supposed to be. That seems odd to me. Thanks for visiting Debt Roundup.
