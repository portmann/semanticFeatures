ETF Hub Apr  3 2015, 10:00 ET | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor With a few small dramas and documentaries in competition, the way is clear for Universal's (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) Furious 7 to dominate the box office, and early receipts suggest the film is well on track toward an April-record $115M weekend. The seventh entry in the Fast and the Furious racing franchise pulled a strong $16.9M in a limited 34-market run on Wednesday, including 12 international markets. It opened in 33 more markets Thursday and will run in 63 markets over the weekend. Other eyes will be on Home -- the high-stakes sole 2015 release for DreamWorks Animation (NASDAQ: DWA ) -- to see if it can get legs from last week's strong $54M debut, and on whether Insurgent (NYSE: LGF ) and Cinderella (NYSE: DIS ) can stretch out gains from their female-heavy audience. So far it seems like Time Warner's Warner Bro Pictures and Comcast 's Universal Pictures are dominating movies (according to Box Office Mojo-Marketshare stats) i hope it not a floppy year for Disney's Walt Disney Pictures afterall Avengers 2 and Star Wars 7 could change things up.
