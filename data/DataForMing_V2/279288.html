Intel's Next Merger - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel recently completed the purchase of Altera and has talked about additional purchases to further increase its growth. Intel's growth areas include data center (specifically cloud computing, high performance computing, and network function virtualization for the telecom industry), IoT and non-volatile memory. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) recently completed the purchase of Altera with the intent to integrate Altera IP into Intel processors to significantly grow Intel's data center and IoT businesses. Intel had partnered with Altera for several years to get to know the IP and the people. Only after this extended engagement did Intel decide to buy the company. This approach does not minimize the purchase price but it does dramatically increase the potential for successfully integrating Altera IP and personnel into Intel. Look for IP that Intel can integrate into Intel processors to increase growth If Intel sees an opportunity to expand its reach into markets, it tends not to buy the company but instead invest in the company. For example, Intel's investments into Chinese companies show a clear pattern and strategy. Intel has put nearly $2 billion in over 140 China-based companies to date. That figure includes its $1.5 billion investment in chip maker Beijing UniSpreadtrum and RDA Microelectronics (20% share of Tsinghua Unigroup) last year and $67 million into eight firms over the last year. According to Intel, "The investments demonstrate Intel's commitment to fostering Chinese technology innovation and accelerating China's technology ecosystem development." Intel will likely continue to focus its buying on companies that provide IP needed by Intel to better serve the IoT and NFV telecom industry (complete purchases are often needed to integrate IP into Intel processors). A previous article described how the Altera purchase (Altera IP integration into Intel processors) will help Intel pursue the ~$30 billion total addressable market associated with NFV ($18 billion) and IoT ($11 billion). All but about $2 billion could be new business to Intel. In addition to Intel seeing critical IP that it needs for its growth goals, it has also shown that in-depth knowledge of the benefits of necessary IP can only be achieved through an existing partnership between Intel and the potential company to be purchased. Intel worked with Altera for several years before buying it. This approach may not bring the best price, but it increases the chances of success in implementing the integration of the new IP into Intel products. This long engagement provides Intel with great insights into the IP, understanding of the benefits of integrating the IP and establishment of good working relationships with the company's key employees. First let's review who is likely not on the list. Then the list will transition to more likely full purchases. Maybe I am missing something (please correct me if I missed something or add your thoughts in comments): Micron (NASDAQ: MU ) - Although Intel has worked closely with Micron for years, Intel already has all the access to Micron IP that it needs. Intel developed most of the technology. There is no need to buy the headaches associated with a commodity-based company. Very unlikely. Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) - There may be some IP that Intel would want but the partnerships have not existed. The IP that Intel may want is focused in the mobile phone area which Intel is not currently pursuing as a current growth area. Unlikely. Applied Micro (NASDAQ: AMCC ) - I don't see Applied Micro IP that Intel could integrate into Intel products. Intel does not seem to simply buy competitors to reduce competition (likely such a purchase would be blocked anyway as reducing competition). I don't see any existing partnerships with Intel. Unlikely. Lattice Semiconductor (NASDAQ: LSCC ) - Seems to be close to Altera with the type of IP . . . but may add some IP that Intel needs. I don't see any existing partnerships with Intel. Unlikely. Chinese Companies - See discussion above. Likely Intel will continue to partner with Chinese companies to expand the footprint of x86 in China. I don't see the IP that Intel needs. Buying a Chinese company would likely not be received well by China's government. Chinese company outright purchases are very unlikely. Inphi (NYSE: IPHI ) - Intel and Inphi have been partnering for many years. It is not clear if Inphi has IP that could be integrated into Intel products but maybe. Inphi talks about partnering with a company for Silicon Photonics ... maybe Intel. "Silicon Photonic 100 Gigabit module partner for enterprise in a big way in 2016." Maybe. Cloudera - A company Intel has worked closely with over several years is Cloudera. Intel owns at least 18% of Cloudera (privately held) and relies on Cloudera for cloud system software related to Hadoop. To make Cloudera a buy candidate, Intel would need to see some IP that it can integrate into its hardware. Maybe? Cloudera seems to be mostly software and services ... so maybe not. I don't see any clear strong candidates. Please add in comments your thoughts on companies that may meet the criteria Intel has made clear: IP to be integrated into Intel products to grow faster AND ongoing relationship/partnership. Intel likely has some candidates and will reveal them AFTER the deal is done. Speculation about specific companies is hard and likely not going to reveal good long-term investments. Speculation will likely continue to move potential acquisition stocks on a short-term basis. Intel's approach of investing in IP that can be profitably integrated into Intel's products is a great strategy and will have strong long-term benefits to Intel shareholders. If you foresaw the decline of desktop sales with the transition to more mobile devices that have the power that most need for surfing the internet, email, messaging, etc., you may have exited Intel a while ago as a long-term investment. Are you aware that messaging apps are now replacing even recent growth companies such as Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ). Some message apps allow a user to message for a Uber ride, message to check your bank balance, check your stocks, message to order a pizza, message to find the weather... without ever leaving the message app. Messaging using voice commands is growing too. Talk to your device like your personal assistant. Things change. Keep changing to live long and prosper. Intel's growth areas are now cloud computing, HPC, NFV, IoT, NVM and more mobile computing. The first three are the biggest current growth areas (Cloud, HPC, NFV). The last three are developing into significant growth areas. Growing into all six of these areas requires lots of new IP. Some of these IP can be grown organically and some are quicker and less expensive if acquired through mergers. So far, the growth in these new areas is replacing profits lost with the decline of desktop unit sales. Soon these new growth areas will grow faster than desktop sales decline. That is when Intel stock will take off. Intel is on the cusp of a new growth spurt that could last for many years. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
