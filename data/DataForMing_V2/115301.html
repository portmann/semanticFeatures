PayPal's Value Is In Its Brand And Acquisitions - Xoom, Inc. (NASDAQ:XOOM) | Seeking Alpha PayPal is not only the oldest digital wallet around but it is among the most trusted. Brits actually placed more confidence in PayPal than in banks and credit card networks. PayPal has positioned itself to dominate the mobile digital wallet business with strategic acquisitions. PayPalâ€™s app-based payment solution, Venmo, also showed substantial growth in Q4 2014. PayPal (Pending: PYPL ) is one of the best value investments in finance because of its brand and its ability to acquire cash-generating subsidiaries. PayPal is not only the oldest digital wallet around but it is also among the most trusted. PayPal is the most trusted mobile payment solution in the United Kingdom; a survey by the Forrester research firm found that 43% of British consumers with iPhones would trust a PayPal digital wallet, but only 27% would trust Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Pay, and just 32% would trust Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ). It should be noted that Apple Pay is not yet available in the UK, although Apple is expected to roll out the service there later this month. Brits actually placed more confidence in PayPal than in banks and credit card networks. Only 40% of those surveyed by Forrester said they would trust a mobile wallet provided by a bank or a credit card company. PayPal's own statistics also indicate a high level of trust in the company. PayPal customers made 11.5 million payments a day during the fourth quarter of 2014, leading to a total of 1.06 billion transactions. PayPal's Total Payment Volume in the fourth quarter of 2014 was 27% higher than for the same period in 2013. PayPal's Braintree payment solutions subsidiary had 104 million credit and debit cards on file in the fourth quarter of 2014, a 22% increase over 2013. The same statistics show something else: PayPal has positioned itself to dominate the mobile digital wallet business with strategic acquisitions. PayPal processed $46 billion in mobile payments in Fourth Quarter 2014, a 68% increase over 2013. Around 25% of all payments made on PayPal in 2014 were made on digital devices. PayPal's app-based payment solution, Venmo, also showed substantial growth; in Fourth Quarter 2014, Venmo's payment volume was 29% higher than in Fourth Quarter 2013. Although the amount of money moved through Venmo is still rather modest, in 2014 the Total Payment Volume for Venmo was $2.4 billion. Venmo entered PayPal's stable of payment solutions when it acquired Braintree Inc. in 2012 for $26.2 billion. What's truly interesting is that Venmo is only one of Braintree's many capabilities. Braintree is so versatile that it could be PayPal's secret weapon in the digital payments wars. Braintree provides a solution that allows businesses to process payments made with PayPal, Bitcoin, Venmo, Apple Pay, Android Pay, Google Pay and credit and debit cards. That means PayPal is in a position to profit from the popularity of Apple Pay and the many other payment solutions that could soon be coming our way. Braintree is poised for growth because of all the new digital payment solutions appearing. Several such solutions are already on the horizon, according to news reports. American Express (NYSE: AXP ) is planning to roll out its answer to Apple Pay, Amex Express Checkout, Re/code reported . A consortium of British banks and retailers is planning to launch an Apple Pay competitor called Zapp in October, Forbes reported . The Merchant Customer Exchange, or MCX, a consortium of companies that includes America's four largest retailers (Wal-Mart, Kroger, Costco and Target) is working on a payment app called Current C. PayPal is well-positioned to take advantage of all these new digital wallets with Payidant , which it acquired in March for $280 million. Payidant licenses a technology that lets retailers take digital wallet payments through their own apps. Payidant is what allows customers at some retailers to use Apple Pay to make payments even though the store's cash registers do not yet accept the app. This means that the growing popularity of Apple Pay will only boost PayPal. Not only will it process Apple Pay payments through Braintree and Payidant but the popularity of Apple Pay will drive the acceptance of other online payment solutions, which Braintree and Payidant will also process. PayPal is poised to grow with or without its strong brand. This makes PayPal much like some of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A ) subsidiaries, such as McLane. It provides the infrastructure that makes other companies work. McLane operates a network of distribution centers and trucks that supplies 45,000 retail locations with everything from chewing gum to beer. Just as Berkshire profits from retail sales without owning the store, PayPal will make money regardless of whose solution you are using. PayPal is also creating an infrastructure to provide international payments. It purchased the online transfer service Xoom Corp (NASDAQ: XOOM ) for $890 million. Xoom allows people in countries like the United States to transfer money directly to people in developing countries like El Salvador online for a small fee. Like some of PayPal's other acquisitions, Xoom has experienced a lot of growth. The transfer company reported a year to year revenue growth rate of 23.6% on March 31, 2015, according to data from yCharts. In contrast, Xoom's two main competitors, Western Union (NYSE: WU ) and MoneyGram International (NASDAQ: MGI ), reported falling rates of revenue growth. Western Union reported a revenue growth rate of -2.21% on March 31, 2015, and MoneyGram reported a rate of -11.8% on the same day. Even economic crises like the one in Greece could create more demand for some of PayPal's solutions. The Greek government effectively blocked almost all transfers of money outside the country from bank accounts, NBC News reported . That action forced PayPal to shut down its digital wallets in the country, but it could drive customers to some of PayPal's other solutions. The banking restrictions could force Greeks to turn to old-fashioned money transfers to get money from relatives abroad, which could help Xoom. After all, Xoom allows you to send money abroad without standing in the line at the grocery store. It has increased interest in Bitcoin in Greece, Reuters reported . Thanos Marinos, the founder of Greece's only Bitcoin exchange, BTCGreece, told the news service that his customer base grew by 400% in May and June. Greeks are turning to Bitcoin because they are afraid the Euros in their bank account could be exchanged for worthless drachmas (Greece's defunct currency) if their nation leaves the Eurozone. Naturally, increased use of Bitcoin could increase the number of transactions PayPal processes. Bitcoin is a logical fit with PayPal because at some point, people will need to purchase goods and services with the crypto-currency in the real world.
