Annual dividends estimated by Yahoo.com divided by closing stock prices as September 4 determined yields. Analyst net target prices were employed to calculate gains one year out. The five lowest-priced Dow stocks per Yahoo were: GE; PFE; VZ; MRK; PG. Five higher-priced stocks completing the Dow Yahoo top ten were: XOM; CAT; CVX; MCD; IBM. This article refines and distinguishes this earlier report that revealed Dow 30 bargain stocks to buy and hold one year. See that article also for an explanation of the term "dogs" for stocks reported based on Michael B. O'Higgins book "Beating The Dow" (HarperCollins, 1991), now named Dogs of the Dow . O'Higgins system works to find bargains in any collection of dividend paying stocks. Utilizing analyst price upside estimates expanded the stock universe to include popular growth equities, if desired. Yield (dividend / price) results from Yahoo.com for 30 Dow industrial stocks as of market closing prices September 4 did the ranking. Yahoo provided this explanation for its calculation of dividends per share: "The formula for dividends per share, or DPS, is the annual dividends paid divided by the number of shares outstanding. The denominator of the dividends per share formula generally uses the annual weighted average of outstanding shares. The weighted average is also used with the earnings per share formula. However, there are key differences between these two formulas. The numerator for earnings per share is net income, or earnings. The numerator for the dividends per share formula is dividends. Earnings is effectively a continuous process throughout the year whereas dividends are paid at a given moment. How often a company pays a dividend may warrant consideration for how to calculate the per share portion of the formula when using financial analysis for investments... As with most financial formulas, perspective is important." Top ten Dow dogs by yield from Yahoo.com/Finance after August included seven of nine business sectors including two basic materials firms, two technology firms, and two healthcare concerns. The Yahoo list includes basic materials; technology; conglomerates; industrial goods; consumer goods; services. (Financials failed to make the top ten and the Dow rates Utilities in a separate index.). Top Ten Highest Yield Dow Dogs Delivered 24.184% VS. (2) 20.94% Net Gains by All Ten by September 4, 2016 per Yahoo $5000 invested as $1k in each of the five Lowest priced stocks in the top ten Dow dividend kennel by yield were predicted by analyst 1-year targets to deliver 15.48% more net gain than the same amount invested in all ten. The third from the highest priced Dow dividend dog, Chevron Corp. (NYSE: CVX ), was projected to deliver the best net gain of 33.36%. Lowest priced five Dow dividend dogs for September 4 were: General Electric (NYSE: GE ); Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE ); Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ ); Merck & Co. (NYSE: MRK ); Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG ), with prices ranging from $24.00 to $68.76. Higher priced five Dow dividend dogs for September 4 were: Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM ); Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT ); Chevron Corp.; McDonald's Corp. (NYSE: MCD ); International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM ), whose prices ranged from $72.46 to $143.70. This distinction between five low priced dividend dogs and the general field of ten reflects the "basic method" Michael B. O'Higgins employed for beating the Dow. The added scale of projected gains based on analyst targets contributed a unique element of "market sentiment" gauging upside potential. It provided a here and now equivalent of waiting a year to find out what might happen in the market. Its also the work analysts got paid big bucks to do. A caution is advised, however, as analysts are historically 20% to 80% accurate on the direction of change and about 0% to 20% accurate on the degree of the change.
