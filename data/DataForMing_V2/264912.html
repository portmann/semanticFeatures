If Disney Were Brave, It Would Do This For 'The Good Dinosaur' - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Disney's "The Good Dinosaur" has so far been neither a creative nor an economic hit for Pixar. The film had a difficult time in the development process; perhaps the company should have moved more aggressively to avoid the delay that story problems caused. One thing CEO Bob Iger could do as an appropriate reaction to the film is move it to digital and DVD platforms much sooner than expected. The Good Dinosaur, Disney's (NYSE: DIS ) latest Pixar film, won't necessarily be the title that critics in the future point to as an example of the animation studio's vaunted historical reputation. It might be a little early in the game to call this one an abject failure of epic proportions, but the word disappointing has been attached to the movie's creative performance. It's easy to understand why. Reviews haven't been stellar, at least as far as what is expected for a Pixar project; the movie is considered a solid piece of entertainment, but it doesn't seem to rise to the level of something like the summer's Inside Out adventure. As for ticket sales, well, the movie isn't performing as one might expect on that count, either. At the time of this writing, according to Box Office Mojo , after three weekends at theaters, the film has collected roughly $90 million in domestic money. Variety fears that the cartoon's total estimated cost of $350 million (this includes marketing) may possibly inhibit the movie from making money (the final worldwide gross will ultimately tell that tale). Much has been made of the fact that the movie had some development problems; apparently, it took a while to get the story right. The movie originally was supposed to be released in summer 2014, but it missed the date, making that year devoid of any Pixar fare (I've previously written about this topic). Now that the film has been released, it's obvious that the execs at Pixar probably shouldn't have overthought the development process and just made a commitment to the summer date. What's done is done, though, and the November 2015 release is in the books. The question for Disney now is one of strategy: What does CEO Bob Iger do now regarding Dinosaur's lackluster theatrical prospects? Releasing the movie to the digital market would be a great experiment. It also would be a smart move given the current conditions at the multiplex; profound apologies to John Lasseter and the rest of his colleagues, but no one cares about Pixar at the moment, and any interest in the story of a good dinosaur has gone extinct. Instead, Lucasfilm is the Disney division that Wall Street and the public are most fascinated by at the moment; Star Wars: The Force Awakens is the film that everyone wants to see, the project that every pundit wants to dissect with an intellectual scalpel. If that is accepted as a probable fact, then a fast-track release to the digital market might make perfect sense for Dinosaur. The digital market is used purposely in this context, because it might offer Disney insight into the buying patterns of media consumers, as well as being, one would imagine, a more expedient way to get the film to audiences in the home as compared to the physical disc. Disney could port Dinosaur to pay-per-view quickly, perhaps by the end of December (even sooner would be preferable), and then onto the DVD/Blu-ray platform sometime in January. Would that help maximize sales, or would creating those windows not offer any benefit, or perhaps even a deleterious result? Disney is not just a creative media conglomerate, but one that has access to a self-collected treasure trove of data; just like most companies these days, it has to incorporate serious data analysis into its business model. Allowing Dinosaur to quietly fade from theaters and move onto home screens, hopefully to be dug up by curious cartoon fans, will give Disney incredible insight into what such an alteration of normal windowing practices will have in terms of sales and profit. As many have observed, a shortened theatrical window may decrease the cost of releasing a film to home video, since the home video release will exist in close proximity to the big marketing push that has already occurred. Theater owners, of course, dislike with unimaginable intensity the very idea of blockbuster films exiting the first-run window within a month; there are obvious reasons for this. However, a content provider such as Disney might be able to improve its profit margin if it were allowed to move a project, whether it is successful in the exhibition marketplace or not, as it saw fit. Shareholders of Disney would benefit from more control being placed in the studio's corporate hands. Finding the best length for each window of distribution, and then getting theater companies to sign off on them, is a daunting puzzle, but that is something for which every media CEO, not just Disney's Iger, should want to invest significant resources in an effort to find a solution.
