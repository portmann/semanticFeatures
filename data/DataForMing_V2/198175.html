Boeing Set To Lose Orders As Transaero Files For Bankruptcy - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Bankruptcy Transaero will not impact Boeing's financials heavily. Boeing's annual deliveries to Russian market are small. Transaero's bankruptcy means loss of 4 Boeing 747-8I orders. Sanctions against Russia and low energy prices have put significant pressure on the Russian economy and the Russian Ruble. As a result, demand for air travel to and from Russia collapsed, sparking a crisis in the Russian airline industry and at the same time acquiring aircraft became more difficult due to the devalued Ruble. This makes it very hard for Russian airlines to pay for the aircraft they ordered. Back in January The Boeing Company (NYSE: BA ) already was discussing fleet development with Russian airlines, but said that none of the carriers was planning on deferring deliveries. Figure 1: Impression of a Boeing 747-8I in Transaero color (Source: airliners.de ) In September 2015 Aeroflot tried to acquire Transaero. Transaero at that time was struggling due to the fact that it applied an exchange rate to the company's debt that sketched a rosy picture. In October Aeroflot announced that it did not acquire Transaero, after which Transaero filed for bankruptcy. Currently Transaero has 97 aircraft in its fleet of which 92 are Boeing aircraft. So in the current fleet Boeing is having a strong lead. Out of those 92 aircraft, 47 are narrow body aircraft. The remaining 45 are wide body aircraft. Transaero currently has 14 Boeing aircraft on order. The airline ordered 10 Boeing 737-800 Next Generation aircraft via a Russian lessor. The estimated market value of that order is $451 mln. Given the current Russian air travel market it is likely that this order will be canceled. The airline previously canceled an order for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, focusing on an order for 4 Boeing 747-8I. Since the airline has filed for bankruptcy, this order will be canceled as well, putting additional pressure on Boeing's 747 program. The order for Boeing's jumbo has an estimated market value of $600 mln. Putting the order loss in perspective Despite being a billion dollar loss for Boeing it has to be noted that the bankruptcy does not have big consequences for Boeing. Orders from Russia cover less than 10% of the total orders and the annual number of deliveries is less than 1%-2% of the total expected number of deliveries. So with all, the loss of Transaero and its orders is more than manageable for Boeing. Transaero is the first big Russian carrier to cease operation due to Russian economic crisis Boeing likely to lose 14 orders valued at $1.1 bn Sales from Russia account for less than 10 percent, signaling a low exposure to risk of decline on Russian market Order loss for the Boeing 747-8I probably will hurt most Although the Russian market is facing difficult times it will not affect Boeing a lot, since deliveries are spread over several years. As soon as oil prices head higher again, Russian airlines probably will see an increase in demand for air travel, while Boeing will see an increase in demand for fuel efficient aircraft. Bankruptcy of Transaero does not weaken the bullish case for Boeing. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
