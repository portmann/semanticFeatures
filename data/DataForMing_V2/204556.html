Why Apple Investors Shouldn't Fear China - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha A Reuters report on manufacturing in China asserted that a sharp slowdown was underway. In fact, the Caixin Purchasing Managers survey that the Reuters report was based on indicated no unusual slowdown in manufacturing. China's growth has been slowing in percentage terms for the past several years, in a Law of Large Numbers effect. While news of a manufacturing slowdown in China roiled markets on Friday, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) was hit especially hard, losing 6% in one day. In the past month, Apple's shares have dropped almost 20%, mostly on concerns about the impact of a presumed China slowdown. (As of publication Monday morning, AAPL is down roughly 5% at $100.43, after reaching an intraday low of $92.00). China is slowing down, but this is mostly due to a "Law of Large Numbers" impact on growth as a percent change from the previous year. In absolute terms, China's growth trajectory is unchanged. As such, Apple is in no way jeopardized by a China "slowdown." Reuters started the slide on Friday with Sharp China factory slowdown in August raises global growth fears . The centerpiece of the article was the Caixin General Manufacturing report issued by markiteconomics.com of the results of a Purchasing Managers Index survey in China for the month of August. Reuters summarized: It was the worst reading since March 2009, in the depths of the global financial crisis, and the sixth straight one below the 50-point level, which separates growth in activity from contraction on a monthly basis. What Reuters said was factually correct, but also misleading. To see this, let's look at the chart of the PMI index and Production Output Index excerpted from the report below: As the reader can see, since the beginning of 2012, the two indices have been under the 50 point mark, indicating industrial contraction, about as often as not. The August readings were only slightly worse than the worst points since 2009. The short-term fluctuation of the August numbers is not significantly worse than similar fluctuations since 2011. There may be something inherently pessimistic about the surveys since one might infer from the plots that manufacturing had all but stagnated since 2011. However, data from the National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBSC) via tradingeconomics.com indicates that manufacturing has continued to grow in the past few years, although at a lower rate in terms of a percentage change compared to the previous year. Succumbing to the Law of Large Numbers Do the declines in percentage growth in manufacturing and GDP indicate that China's economy is stagnating, or worse, heading into a recession? They really don't. What we have here appears to be legitimate case of the Law of Large Numbers. In the past, I've argued that the so called Law of Large Numbers didn't apply very strongly to individual companies. One of the key arguments of the Law is that a company can't continue to post the same y/y percent growth, or it will outgrow the economy as a whole. Most companies, even very large companies such as Apple, aren't at risk of outgrowing the economy. However, I'm certainly persuaded that very large national economies, such as China's, could see growth curtailed relative to the global economy. The more trivial interpretation of the Law is that year-over-year percent growth gets smaller for a given level of absolute growth, as the company (or nation) grows larger. This is pretty much what has been happening in China's GDP growth. The above discussion is not to argue that China's economic growth isn't slowing down in real terms. It is, but this has been occurring for the past few years. While the media may greet the PMI survey with feigned surprise, this seems to be for effect. The media thrives on sensationalism. The slowdown in Chinese manufacturing hasn't had an effect on Apple's growth in Greater China thus far, and I don't expect it to have an effect going forward. And once again, there's little that indicates that China is about to experience a true economic contraction. This appears to be confirmed by a couple of confidence indexes maintained by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) . The Business Confidence Index for China stands at about where it's been for the past few years: I hesitate to offer direct investing advice. As I've stated before, if someone wanted to bail out of Apple, I wouldn't blame them under the current circumstances. The media coverage of Apple and the stock are behaving basically as I predicted in Apple's False Correction . I don't expect the negativity about Apple to let up until January. Watching the stock decline for the next few months will be difficult for retail investors with a short investment time line. And I can't say for sure that there won't be a recession in China, but the evidence for it, or even an unusual slowdown, seems very insubstantial. But I will state what I personally intend to do. I'm going to hold onto Apple, and look for opportunities to accumulate more. In contrast to some bloggers who issue grandiose Apple price targets and buy recommendations while not owning the stock, I'm putting my money where my mouth is.
