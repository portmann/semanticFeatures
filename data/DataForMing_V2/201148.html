Verizon: Mobile Ad Dumpster Diving - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha Stone Fox Capital , Stone Fox Capital (1,598 clicks) Verizon is slowly building up a mobile-ad service. The go9 mobile service offers a glimpse of the future, though providing limited impact to current financials. The wireless provider continues to pivot toward the future while providing investors a 5% yield to enjoy in the mean time. Though the AOL deal didn't originally appear to offer much value to a wireless behemoth like Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ ), considering its lack of growth and small size, some opportunities emerged that made the service all additive. In a similar manner, the purchase of Millennial Media (NYSE: MM ) for a meager $248 million doesn't appear to offer anything meaningful to a company worth over $180 billion. Neither purchase alone or even combined provides anything financially impactful or meaningful to Verizon for now, but the company is making these purchases at prices similar to dumpster diving for treasure. When combined with the ambitions of building a mobile Internet TV service, Verizon is quickly building a powerhouse platform to make the mobile video service ad-supported. The AOL division of Verizon agreed to pay $1.75 per share for Millennial Media. The stock price is near the all-time lows for a company that IPO'd near $30. While Millennial Media has struggled to build a profitable business, it did constantly shift and merge with several businesses like Jumptap and Nexage to build up a programmatic ad network. The company struggled to sustain revenue growth after turning public, but it does offer AOL some scale with annual revenue of around $270 million. With the $2.7 billion revenue base of AOL, the new service is a combined $3 billion powerhouse in the Internet advertising space. Considering that analysts forecast Verizon reaching $130 billion in annual revenues, the Internet advertising business is still nothing more than a sideshow. The best part is that the company hasn't paid much to obtain it. With numerous companies launching OTT Internet TV services earlier this year, the offering from Verizon hadn't generally gotten a lot of attention until it initially skyrocketed up the iOS charts. Most of the services like HBO Go from Time Warner (NYSE: TWX ) or the new Sling TV from Dish Network (NASDAQ: DISH ) are options for cord cutters to obtain a reduced selection of mostly cable programming at substantially lower subscription prices. Verizon is taking a different approach to the service with the goal of being a "mobile first" offering that is targeted towards wireless connections. The name "go90" is even a play on the move consumers make to flip a mobile device 90 degrees sideways in order to improve the viewing size of the video. The service is targeted to the millennial and teenage groups. The plan includes free content from the likes of Awesomeness TV, Dreamworks (NASDAQ: DWA ) and original content from the AOL division. Most importantly, the plan appears to make the service ad supported by utilizing the ad-targeting technology of AOL and now the mobile programmatic platform from Millennial Media. As mentioned in the previous article, Verizon's move into a mobile video service offers a compelling proposition since it isn't one of the big players in the pay-TV area. As the data showed, Verizon is a distant 5th place in the sector after the recent completion of the AT&T (NYSE: T ) and DirecTV merger left the combination the largest in the sector. With over 100 million mobile customers and only 6 million pay-TV customers, Verizon doesn't need to worry about offering an OTT service that cannibalizes existing revenue streams. The mobile video service at Verizon is still taking shape, but the leading wireless network has now built up a digital advertising powerhouse without breaking the bank. The go90 app is no longer ranking high in the iOS app store. The biggest complaint appears that a lot of the content is generally available for free on YouTube or other places. Not to mention, issues exist with data consumption that might limit the use of the service for now. Either way, Verizon is building for the future and heading in the right direction. The offering clearly needs more content to attract users, but the company hasn't bet the farm on the service. With a dividend yield over 5% and a strong wireless service, investors are getting paid to wait whether this small investment eventually pays off or not.
