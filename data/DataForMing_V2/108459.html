(FTR) | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Frontier Communications ( FTR +1.4%) says it's worked out a cutover plan to ensure no service disruption in its assumption of Verizon's wireline properties in California, Florida and Texas. The company laid out 140 individual functional plans in an FCC filing , which include detailed tests and training for current Verizon employees on handling the closing with customers. The move involves preparation to deal with legacy GTE back-office systems in the three states. Frontier has some experience there; in 2010, it integrated Verizon operations in 14 states using similar back-office systems. Since reaching a $10.5B deal to acquire the Verizon wirelines assets in early February, Frontier shares have dropped by a third -- particularly in May, where they lost 26% of market value.
