Facebook: Instagram Should Get More Likes Than Twitter With Real-Time And Global Ad Launch - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Facebook is out with a slew of meaningful monetization updates for Instagram. None are more important than a real-time option aptly called Marquee. I think with the upgrades that Instagram is now the most attractive pure-play advertising and marketing platform in the world. Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) has taken yet another swing at Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) with its most recent update(s) to its Instagram platform. Not that Facebook views Instagram as a direct competitor to Twitter, I'm not sure Facebook "views" Twitter at all - it probably doesn't even take the second-class social citizen (which I'm still long) serious, but what it has done with Instagram has definite Twitter-like use cases associated. I think this is a big deal for Facebook and a big deal for Instagram. If Instagram had its own account (it does but I mean in a non-enterprise/valuation driving way) it would likely be posting a self-promoting, duck-faced selfie or a birthday cake photo in celebration of what it has just pulled off. Instagram's coup shouldn't be swiped by - investors need to really focus the valuation camera on what exactly this means for the platform and what it means for Facebook. Overly used metaphors and clichés aside, this really is a big deal. Let's start from the beginning. Facebook announced several monetization updates for the Instagram platform. The most meaningful are that ads are going global (starting with the more developed economies first, obviously), ads now support landscape photo/video, max ad length has doubled, and most importantly Instagram now has a new premium ad feature called "Marquee". What does this all mean? Big things of course. First, ads going global increases the marketing and advertising TAM. This has never once in the history of capitalism been a bad thing. So, that's a good thing. Second, ads having a landscape capacity and ads being given a long run-window changes the way ads can and will be shot. My guess is the quality of the ads increases substantially from both an invested dollar standpoint from advertisers/marketers and from a messaging standpoint. If you don't think the last part matters, it does. Higher quality content has never in the history of advertising and marketing been a bad thing. So, that's a good thing. I work with several private advertising and marketing companies that tell me, but this is obvious, that when the messaging is "on" for the target audience the audience stops viewing the advertisement as an ad. If you and I stop viewing advertisements as ads, we can be advertised to more effectively and in greater volume. Both of those are huge for Facebook's key metrics and for Facebook's illustrating of the need for its platform. I won't go further into why those are important for driving financials because I think this dynamic is well understood. Here's a great example of what is currently on Twitter but that could and should be coming to Instagram. Why would Belvedere move its ad to Instagram from Twitter? Scale, efficacy, viewer context (read: viewers are expecting to be visually dazzled on Instagram and have shown to not care if they're being sold something as long as it's visually dazzling) - need I go on? Third, and again most importantly, Instagram now offers a way for brands to advertise to a targeted audience at scale via Marquee. This bring a real-time use case to Instagram that it didn't really have a core competency focus on prior. Isn't this what Twitter's valuation is built on, real-time? I think it is and I think that's why this Instagram move is a big deal in the battle for social-user monetization potential. Instagram now brings advertisers and marketers a real-time platform that contextually places advertisements in a different way than Twitter and brings a way to target the audience on a very granular level (via Instagram borrowing information from Facebook's profiles). That alone should have been enough to sway the decision of which platform to favor/spend more on but the additional functions just described I think makes this an easy win for Instagram. Instagram now, with its global scale and fully built out capacity, is the single most attractive advertising pure play platform in the world. Yes, more so than Facebook. Facebook, for reasons that I've described in detail prior , is great for what I would call out as closing a sale whereas Instagram is more what I would define as a pure-play advertisers and awareness (discovery is a word I've used prior as well) platform. Now, with its real-time capacity - and I've previously made this argument as the single most prominent reason to value Twitter at all, Instagram can advertise and market to its audience at "peak emotional" state. Control, flexibility, and optionality are incredibly valuable, almost priceless assets to both marketing and advertising. Instagram has now brought that in an extremely targeted way to the community in an open architecture format. Now if it could just monetize the selfie - maybe it just did.
