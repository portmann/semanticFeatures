Apple Watch Volumes Are Much Better Than Slice Figures Suggest - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha The sensationalist headlines are at it again; this time we have to explore whether Apple Watch flopped. I'm not convinced by Slice's data, because it's only inclusive of the United States and excludes the older demographic. Apple Watch sales were constrained by supply chain issues, which was a risk factor I mentioned in prior articles. Apple Watch doesn't need to generate iPhone-like volumes to be considered a commercially viable product. Apple Watch could pick up momentum in the holiday quarter, so the doom mongering crowd will likely get this one wrong. Things got pretty nasty last week, as Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) data circulated over the doom of the Apple Watch. For the most part, I'm highly skeptical of the data by Slice, and I also believe it's not representative of the growth trajectory of Apple Watch. Volume does typically drop after the initial launch of any product, but given the supply constraints, the drop may have been more pronounced. I've said this in the past, and I'll continue to reiterate that Apple's most notorious risk factor is supply chain related. They either overestimate the available capacity, or underestimate the demand. In this case, Apple Watch sales were weak due to the lack of supply. There are three issues with the data, which I will briefly summarize: The data only applies to the United States (Apple generated 36% of its revenue in the Americas). Keyword is Americas, we would also need to subtract out Canada, Mexico, and South America from the Americas to get an accurate depiction of United States revenue. Unfortunately, Apple doesn't break it down that far, but realistically it's fair to assume that the United States only accounts for a quarter to a third of the global Apple Watch launch, so we can assume that Apple sold substantially more. For all we know, Apple could have diverted supply away from the United States and sold more of its product into the Chinese retail channel. So just because we have a downward sloping graph in one regional market doesn't mean the same pattern is playing out in China. For all we know, Chinese sales volume could be picking up. Furthermore, all of Apple's manufacturing capabilities are based out of Taiwan and China. Therefore, from a transportation perspective, it would be easier to fulfill demand in the eastern markets before taking supply west into Europe and the United States. Apple operates an extremely lean supply chain, and if anything, the most efficient pathway to sales is to improve sell through to the nearest available market, i.e. China, Korea, and Japan. Then focus on ramping volume later in the year to address demand in markets like the United States, and Germany. Finally, how do we even verify the validity of the model, as it was based on snooping through e-mails of users? Sure they proclaim to have a population sample of 2.5 million shoppers, so it might be representative. But, Apple's demographic mix is pretty diversified across the various age groups, and from what I have seen, the older age demographic loves Apple products, but don't use as many apps as teenagers. Given this fact, the population sample of Slice is likely to be composed primarily of millennials, which is a different demographic mix from Apple. Therefore, the data is likely to correlate, but statistically you might have to model outward to the second standard deviation to gain the full range of possibilities with that data. In other words, it's not going to be very accurate. The data from Slice is primarily supplied by people who belong in the 18-25 and 25-34 age demographic, as evidenced by mobile app hour usage by demographic. For less known apps, the data is likely to skew even further to the younger demographic. However, iPhone ownership is distributed evenly with the age distribution of the United States. Therefore, Apple loyalists above the age of 35 may show similar buying behavior to those that belong in the younger age demographic. However, the younger demographic isn't actually the largest demographic in the United States. In fact, the biggest demographic is 35+, therefore Slice's data could be off by a wide margin. Apple Watch customers will also be inclusive of older people, and when excluding this demographic, it's unlikely that Slice's data could be accurate. Furthermore, if you check into an Apple retail store you find a disproportionate number of people that are well over the age of 35 in comparison to other retail chains. Therefore, I believe the hype over Apple Watch shipments was headline-catching news that average journalists jumped on without taking into consideration the various other data points that could conflict with the data. In other words, Watch sales will likely improve, as more and more supply makes it into the retail store where sales reps will be able to demonstrate the product and educate potential consumers on the merits of the wearable technology. Not everyone buys products on the Internet, and the older demographic really loves to shop in physical retail locations. The stock may have found a floor after a week of shaky news. The broader market recovered on Friday with Apple performing better than the Dow Component by a very healthy margin. If anything, the stock seems cheap at these lower levels, as widely misreported data, and low-expectations going into Q3 earnings have opened an opportunity to buy cheap and sell even higher. Apple Watch volumes will surprise estimates once supply chain issues have been corrected. Getting reliable data will be difficult, and we can't gain complete confidence from third-party data sources. However, Apple isn't really required to breakdown the sales of the Apple Watch until it reaches 10% of consolidated revenue. So, we could be flying in the dark for a while. Even so, we might get lucky if an analyst asks Tim Cook directly on the Q3 earnings conference call what Apple Watch sales were, and what they're projected to be next quarter. He might brush the question aside, and supplement with vague commentary, so I'm not getting my hopes too high. We've seen Tim dodge pointed questions numerous times in the past.
