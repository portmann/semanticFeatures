Disney Is Breaking Out To New Highs - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Disney continues to fire on all cylinders and it is reflected in the stock price. The Studio business is the heart and soul of Disney and the pipeline of content is staggering. Shares of entertainment juggernaut Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS ) just broke out to new highs as optimism from investors in general in US stocks and the fact that Disney can seemingly do no wrong has seen shares move steadily higher. I've been bullish on Disney for some time as it became clear late last year that the company's expectations for earnings growth were too low. That has thus far proven to be true as Disney continues to power ahead and make more and more money each year. In this article I intend to outline why the company's extraordinary run is far from over and why even if you're not on board yet, it isn't too late. I am predisposed - as I believe many investors are - against buying stocks that are hitting highs. As a value investor it simply goes against my nature; why do I want to pay the highest price that has ever been seen for a particular stock? It is as counterintuitive as it gets for me in the investing world because after all, we all want a "good deal". But just how good a deal is depends, of course, upon the future and not the past so work with me here as we take a look at Disney's bright future and forget for a second that the stock is at the highest price it has ever seen. For me the most excitement surrounding Disney at this point is the film division. Disney has always made great movies that were very profitable and popular (well, maybe not always ) but the pipeline of content coming our way in the next few years is nothing short of breathtaking. After Disney gobbled up Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm - all within the past decade - the company's Studio division has been on fire. Franchises like Avengers that produce enormous profits through box office receipts but also have nearly endless storylines that can be adapted are goldmines for Disney. Avengers has many more movies that will be made as characters evolve and the writers work their magic with the various stories. In short, there are billions more in box office receipts headed Disney's way in the next few years just from Avengers. In addition to that there are the Star Wars films that have made George Lucas a billionaire that Disney now has the rights to. The next Star Wars installment due out later this year is generating lots of interest with the trailer attracting tens of millions of hits. I'd expect nothing less from Star Wars but the fact that it now has the Disney media machine behind it should help elevate it to the next level. It will be interesting to see how the launch goes and how hardcore fans react because this will not be the last Star Wars film we see either. The same is true for the Spider-Man franchise, one that was a "disappointment" with its $708 million box office draw for the Amazing Spider-Man 2 in 2014. Marvel is planning to re-launch the character in 2017 which should prove to be a nice boost for Disney's studio division. I don't expect this franchise will produce the profits Star Wars and Avengers will but Disney could still stand to make hundreds of millions of dollars from it. All of this talk mentions nothing of Disney's in-house, original content like Frozen or Inside Out which, in their own rights, would make a world class studio business. There is also no shortage of princess movies - which are always tremendously profitable - and since there will always be little girls that like movies about princesses, we don't have to worry that their popularity will fade. With all of the purchased content Disney owns it can be easy to forget that it makes its own films as well but they are a very important piece of the puzzle. The beauty of all of this is that the studio division - as profitable as it is - is just the beginning of the ecosystem. All of these franchises - in varying degrees - offer Disney the chance to collectively sell billions of dollars' worth of merchandise. Properties like Avengers, Spider-Man, Star Wars and Frozen are ripe for merchandising and while the original Frozen is far beyond its peak, a sequel is on the way that should generate new interest. These properties produce merchandising opportunities even beyond the frenzy of the films themselves in things like action figures, clothing and video games, all of which Disney receives healthy royalties from. As if that weren't enough, Disney also owns world class resorts and theme parks that are based upon its intellectual properties. When a tremendous success occurs, it ends up in a theme park. This not only draws visitors into the parks but strengthens Disney's brand and allows it to sell merchandise at the park as well. The ecosystem is why investors own Disney and the ecosystem is entirely dependent upon content. The company's lucrative Media segment doesn't produce much in the way of content for the ecosystem but it makes lots of money. The ecosystem really starts with the Studio business and with the pipeline of content coming our way in the next couple of years, the future looks very bright indeed for Disney. The beauty is that with so many potential winners, even if something disappoints, there are many other properties to help pick up the slack. But given the company's ability to produce top shelf content, that seems nearly unfathomable at this point. The ecosystem is stronger than ever for Disney and that is why, even at all-time highs, I'm sticking to my bullish call. Every time I check back in with Disney I find my estimates are too low and this time is no exception; Disney's earnings growth should see it at $130 or so this year and if upside surprises occur at the box office, that could prove to be low.
