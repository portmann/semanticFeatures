Analyst Bullish on Intel Corporation Following Investor Day - Modest Money Analysts and investors are bullish on Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC ) following the companyâ€™s investor day. Following the meeting, analysts expressed concerns about the companyâ€™s move to increase investment in memory chip capabilities, as some believe that partner Micron Technology will not be up to speed with the jointly developed 3dx point technology. Other uncertainties include the cracks in Intelâ€™s server market, which analysts believe competitor Cavium will fill. Despite these concerns, the pros outweigh the cons for most analysts. The company presented a plan for revenue growth projected into next year, after steady declines from 2014 due to a weak PC market and a lukewarm enterprise server portion of the business, Data Center Group. Despite recent weaknesses, analysts have many reasons to be bullish. During investor day, management projected revenue growth for 2016 in the â€œmid-single digits,â€? slightly above analyst consensus of 4.2% growth. Data Center Group has been steadily growing, as well as the companyâ€™s set of smaller businesses, which add up to a large portion of the companyâ€™s revenue. Analysts believe that â€œgrowth in these businesses can more than offset fairly significant declines in the companyâ€™s Client Computing Group,â€? the companyâ€™s PC and tablet/smartphone business. Intel plans to spend $10 billion, up from the projected $7.3 billion in its latest earnings release. CFO Stacey Smith reassured investors about this increase, stating, â€œOur financials show that Intelâ€™s transformation is underway and weâ€™re forecasting growth for 2016.â€? She presented the napkin math theory, which showed that company can still achieve revenue growth even with a 10% decline in the PC market. Intel believes that the Client Computing Group, the companyâ€™s largest generator of revenue, and DCG will continue to show growth in the upcoming year, even if itâ€™s slight. On Friday, the company hired former Qualcomm founder Dr. Venkata Renduchintala to oversee its Client and Internet of Things Businesses, which includes the Client Computing Group. The company also increased its dividend to $1.04 from $0.96, as a way to show its appreciation and value for its shareholders. Smith continued, â€œThe 2016 dividend increase reflects confidence in the strategy and Intelâ€™s ongoing commitment to create value and return cash to shareholders.â€? Following these developments, analyst David Wong of Wells Fargo weighed in on the stock, reiterating an Outperform rating and a $40 to $50 valuation range. He states, â€œWe think Intel has a strong lineup of products that will help it gain microprocessor market share. Intel also has a history of strong roadmap execution, enabling it to maintain a leadership position in microprocessor technology.â€? He continues, â€œWe think that Intel will be able to maintain and possibly even grow its manufacturing technology lead in the future, helping the company win share and drive growth in new segments such as smartphone chips, Internet-of-things (IoT) and foundry.â€? Separately, analyst John Pitzer from Credit Suisse also expressed bullish sentiments on the technology company. He mentions that 40% of the companyâ€™s revenue and 65% of its operating income comes from its non-PC businesses, up from 34% revenues and 15% operating income from four years ago. The analyst continues, â€œWhile operating leverage was perhaps less than we hoped in CY16 â€“ with much of the Mobile savings being re-invested in DCG, IoTG and tech development â€“ we continue to see INTCâ€™s willingness to de-emphasize â€˜financial-engineeringâ€™ to focus on investment and innovation as a strength, not a weakness.â€? According to TipRanks, out of the 28 analysts who have rated Intel in the last 3 months, 17 gave a Buy rating, 2 gave a Sell rating, and 9 remain on the sidelines.
