Netflix And Pricing Power - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Netflix had another great quarter in terms of revenue and subscriber growth, but weak in terms of earnings and free cash flow. At some point, subscriber growth will slow down. When this happens, Netflix will need to raise prices to generate the free cash flow to justify its valuation. Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) reported results Wednesday that were once again well received by the market. Despite weak free cash flow and earnings, the stock was up 17% Thursday. This is mainly due to another huge jump in subscriber and revenue growth that blew away the company's internal estimates. Any investors who have been following Netflix for a while shouldn't be surprised by this. Netflix's stock price has traded on subscriber and revenue growth instead of traditional metrics such as earnings and free cash flow for years now. The result is a company whose stock price looks insanely expensive using any traditional valuation metric you can think of. Much of the bear case points towards this valuation and the underlying fundamentals to conclude that Netflix's stock price will inevitably collapse - when subscriber growth slows and the market realizes that Netflix is little more than an extremely low margin media company that cannot actually generate cash flow for its investors. This is absolutely a legitimate risk for investors in Netflix today, but it is far from an inevitable conclusion to the NFLX growth story. In my opinion, it is just as likely that NFLX justifies its valuation and indeed continues to grow by utilizing its pricing power once the subscriber growth slows. By utilizing the most recently released financial statements , investors can get an idea as to how these price raises could impact the bottom line. To show investors how a raise in prices would dramatically increase the profitability of Netflix, I took the released financial statements linked above and entered in my own future growth assumptions. First, I found the Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) of each paid streaming subscriber per month. I simply divided the quarterly streaming revenue by the total paid subscriber number, and then divided this number by 3. The result was $7.87. I then projected what would happen if Netflix attempted a small, incremental price hike over time to boost its revenue, shooting to increase the ARPU by 40% by the midway point of 2017, exactly two years from now. Simultaneously, I factored in a 2% increase quarterly in cost of revenues (investors should note that according to Netflix SEC filings and the investor FAQ , this is where streaming costs are accounted), a 0.9% increase in quarterly marketing costs, and a 1% increase in subscriber growth. These numbers are roughly similar to the recent quarterly increases in each category, although I tried to be a little conservative with my subscriber growth estimate. To simplify these numbers for both myself and readers, I only took the numbers from streaming, ignoring the legacy DVD segment. The results can be found in the table below. As you can see from the above chart, these estimates gave NFLX an EPS of $6.69 by the summer of 2017 if they were to roll out a major price increase in the near future. A future EPS of $6.69, with further room for expansion and growth, would easily justify the current stock price and likely mean that NFLX continues to outperform the market significantly. Many bears assume that NFLX does not have pricing power and that if they try to raise prices they will be met with millions of cancellations. However, I disagree with this. As outlined in a previous bullish article on NFLX, I believe that the company has established itself in the mind of consumers as a significant media force. The focus on original content and ever increasing library of such products only serves to further the brand power of Netflix, and I believe that the company could easily raise prices to between $15-20 a month domestically without incurring major cancellations. Internationally, price hikes may be far down the road - but as long as Netflix continues the same business strategy it is likely that they will be able to establish pricing power in many of their international markets. There is no doubt that Netflix is extremely overvalued, but that does not mean it is a poor or risky investment. Eventually, the bears will be right about at least one thing - subscriber growth will slow down. It could take 2-3 years, or it could happen next quarter - but eventually it will happen. When it happens, the market will be forced to look at the fundamentals to price Netflix. Currently, the bears are absolutely right - Netflix has very weak earnings and poor free cash flow. However, Netflix's pricing power can turn the only glaring weakness into the company into a strength relatively quickly. This pricing power will allow Netflix to not only justify its current valuation, but continue to outperform the market over the long term.
