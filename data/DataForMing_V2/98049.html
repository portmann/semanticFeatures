ETF Hub Jun 25 2015, 17:58 ET | About: Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor "We will need to innovate in new areas, execute against our plans, make some tough choices in areas where things are not working and solve hard problems in ways that drive customer value," says Satya Nadella (NASDAQ: MSFT ) towards the end of an employee memo providing a new mission statement. Worth remembering: The last time Nadella hinted at big changes in a memo (July 2014), Microsoft announced major layoffs a week later. The latest missive comes a week after Microsoft announced a reorg that (among other things) creates a new Windows and Devices group responsible for both OS and hardware development. I interpret it as getting rid of non-performing product areas and people associated with them. Every company should do that. I also see it as a warning to employees - shape up or ship out. The number one area that "doesn't work" is windows phone I'd say. Would be a huge write off after the Nokia acquisition. After they let go all the Xbox R&D department last summer, I am surprised they haven't sold the whole gaming division either, especially after their poor showing recently at E3 in Los Angeles. We must've watched different E3s, they had a solid showing. Backwards compatibility and a good amount of fall exclusives (Something Sony is lacking), is sure to bring 360 owners on the fence over to XBONE. Unless Sony pulls a rabbit out of their hat, Fall belongs to XBox. The future beyond that wasn't really showcased for XBox at E3 (besides Gears 4 of course). ""Nearly all IT professionals (96 percent) are interested in Windows 10, and 60 percent of IT departments have tested or are actively testing the new operating system, according to a survey of more than 500 respondents by Spiceworks. The survey also found that 40 percent of companies plan to begin rolling out Windows 10 within the first year of its release and an additional 33 percent expect to begin deploying Windows 10 within two years.""
