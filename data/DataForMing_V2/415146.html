Verizon Wireless Hangs Up On You When You Record Them Back â€“ Consumerist Whoops! It looks like portions of our site are being blocked!

But that wasn’t the case for one Consumerist reader, who said a Verizon rep hung up on him when informed that the customer would be recording their call. Consumerist reader Olivier wrote on Twitter about a recent experience he had with a Verizon Wireless representative who called him up — for what reason, we may never know — and told him the conversation they were about to have would (or could be) recorded for quality assurance and/or training purposes. “The breezy @verizon guy then asks me whether I’m ok with being recorded. I tell him I am, because I am also recording the call,” Olivier writes as part of a series of Tweets recounting his experience. “There’s a pause. Then breezy @verizon guy tells me Verizon DOES NOT ALLOW THEIR REPS TO BE RECORDED so he has to hang up.” When he asked the Verizon worker how that could be true, Olivier says he was told that Verizon “does not allow its representatives to be recorded by customers.” It’s true: if Verizon — or any other customer-facing company — doesn’t want customers to record calls, it’s up to them whether or not they want to hang up. But that could leave quite the sour taste in a customer’s mouth. And of course, this not the first time we’ve heard from readers about similar encounters with customer service reps. A Verizon Twitter team member did reply to Olivier’s story with a boilerplate response that shows no evidence an actual human read his Tweets in the first place: — Verizon Wireless CS (@VZWSupport) May 25, 2016 We’ve reached out to Verizon to clarify the company’s policy on customers recording phone calls, and will update this post when we hear back.
