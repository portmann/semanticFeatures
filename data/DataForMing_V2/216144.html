Apple: Why $116-$120 Will Soon Be History - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple made a significant move up last week. The stock price has been held back by negativity for over three months. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has just made a significant move by closing sharply over its 50-day moving average (currently 112.24) for the first time in three months on September 20, and rising steadily from there. It is not the norm for Seeking Alpha to post technical analysis, and I will not dwell too long on this, but rather show how this fact reflects a real change in attitude in the market, and what this means for the stock price. For a stock price to cross a major moving average is considered significant (bullish or bearish depending on the direction). The problem that I have with technical analysis is that it disregards real events in the world, and looks only at the technical data as a thing in and of itself. This is not Seeking Alpha's focus, nor mine. I believe, however, that one can use technical analysis to provide a window into real world sentiments and so would like to use this as a jumping off point to show how the current move reflects what is happening in a very significant change in investors' view of the stock. So, what does this indicate? The tech folks believe that a crossing such as this is one indication that the stock is reversing and going to move higher. If we move this into the real world, one would ask "Why is this about to happen?" I believe there are good reasons for this, and so the technical event merely reflects changes in investor sentiment. In February, April and July, Apple made attempts to rise above $133, each time falling back, until in August it fell back into the $110 - $116 range, only breaking out of this last Friday (Oct. 23). To my mind there were two major drivers of this (as well as several smaller issues). These were: "Apple can not continue like this" syndrome It's the ending of these two factors that is now driving Apple stock prices higher, resulting in the recent technical indicator. The Chinese fear hit in earnest when China devalued the Yuan on August 11. There have been increasing fears of an economic slowdown as industrial output has slowed and the Chinese stock market dropped. Negativity sells (or at least brings hits) and articles flourished predicting the doom of the Chinese, if not the whole global economy. And all this was to strike at the heart of Apple's newest, and greatest, growth driver. "China could be in the world's greatest depression and they would still report 7%," says Gordon Chang, a China expert and author of "The Coming Collapse of China." Across the board, the statistics don't look good with everything from steel to rail freight to electricity consumption showing big drops. China's manufacturing sector looks especially weak - sentiment just hit its lowest level in six years. China delivered over $13 billion in Apple's fiscal Q3 (June), for about 26% of total revenue, up 112% year over year. If China sales were to fall, particularly for iPhones, then it would have a significant impact on revenues and profits for the electronics maker. As has been noted, as here in Business Insider in May: However, the increase in household wealth is only getting going. Over the next few decades hundreds of millions of Chinese families are likely to join their ranks, propelling huge increases in consumption across a wide variety of sectors. Quoting a research note by ANZ greater China economists Li-Gang Liu and Louis Lam, the article continues: 326m new middle class will emerge in China's urban areas from 2014 to 2030. They also forecast that by 2030 per capita disposable income in urban areas will be in excess of $US30,000 in purchasing power parity terms, up from less than $US10,000 at present. This is a battleship that will not turn around on a dime. This growth is all in Apple's economic back yard, and we should note that "326m new middle class" is equal to the entire population of the United States. What has become evident is that any woes of the overall Chinese economy are likely to have minimal effects on consumer spending there. This growth is a factor that is not likely to change, and certainly not quickly (barring a major worldwide breakdown). So even if there is a slowdown from the 112% growth of last quarter, we are still likely to see very significant growth. I would like to point out that 50% growth of 200 is the same as 100% growth of 100. So, as the growth is cumulative, a smaller percentage will still drive huge number increases. 2 - "Apple can not continue like this" syndrome This is a theme that is recurs whenever Apple has outstanding results as it did the last two quarters. The meme goes: Sure Apple just had a great quarter with surprising growth, but this was a special case, and so there is no way they can do it again. Apple sales are faltering because (insert rationale du jour) and results will drop. Of course there is an element of truth in some of this. Clearly sales cannot increase forever, certainly not at exponential rates. Thus growth will eventually slow. Eventually there must come a time in the future when sales will fall. Markets will reach a saturation point and some economic downturn will reduce sales. Blog 24/7 WallStreet headlines : Could Apple's Shares Drop 20%? The thesis is that if sales fail to meet estimates, then shares could drop precipitously. This is true, but the likelihood of a substantial beat of estimates is historically more likely than a severe miss. But this period of reduced sales does not seem to have arrived. Most current reports have iPhone sales continuing to be robust. Chuck Jones at Forbes has more realistic expectations. He writes : He estimates 49 million iPhones sold - up a robust 25% over last year, and notes that some analyst surveys are showing 50 - 55 million sold. China Mobile (NYSE: CHL )… added 18.4 million 4G users for a total of 247.6 million and 58 million for the September quarter. While many articles over the last several months have tried to drag down Apple, it's likely that sales this quarter will set a new record for fiscal Q3 and growth will be excellent if not equal to last quarter's growth. Obviously there still are risks. The future cannot be known. Even this quarter's analyst estimates may turn out to be too high, and Apple really will deliver a major disappointment. If so, a price retreat could be major. But the contrary is much more likely. The realistic scenarios given by Chuck Jones and others will likely be achieved (if not surpassed). The price, however, has now been suppressed for so long. It's price has risen less than $9 (8%) since its close December 31 of last year. This is in spite of the fact that for the last three quarters revenue growth has been almost 30% and net income growth well over 30%. There has been a major disconnect here, and a good showing with the earnings release on Tuesday (Oct. 27) will make a point that is undeniable: the stock is grossly undervalued. And this should send the price back up well past its previous high of $134 and into new record territory. If that should happen, then the current price will be history, and it's unlikely we will see it again. Investing is speculation. An investor has the choice of taking the risk of getting in early, or waiting until the news is out and getting in late. One other reason to believe in the technical move is that since so many investors do, in fact, invest on technical analysis alone, there will be a significant number of these folks buying in now, driving the price higher in a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy.
