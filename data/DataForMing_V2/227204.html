Click to print (Opens in new window) The OmniLynx website is still up, but the school district notified current customers that their service is slated to be terminated as of Nov. 30. Not even a year has passed since the rollout of OmniLynx — an effort by the Huntsville, AL, school system to provide city residents with affordable WiFi access — and the school’s partner, Verizon is already pulling the plug. For $47.75/month (without a contract), OmniLynx users got a free Verizon LTE hotspot and unlimited data access. At first, it was available to just Huntsville school system employees before being expanded to cover students and their families, then anyone in Huntsville. The school tells AL.com that around 1,900 people have signed up since OmniLynx launched in January, and that around 120 a day were signing up until last week, when Verizon brought down the hammer. On Oct. 30, Verizon informed the school district that it had gone “beyond the terms of the agreement” and was canceling the partnership. “We regret to inform you that your wireless service will terminate effective November 30, 2015,” reads the letter to customers, according to WHNT-TV . “This termination of service and any resulting inconvenience has resulted from the service provider, Verizon Wireless… and its decision to discontinue its support of the program. Needless to say, this circumstance is unfortunate and we are disappointed by Verizonâ€™s decision â€“ particularly in light of the fact that Verizon publicly endorsed and applauded the OmniLynx program less than one year ago.” In response to the Verizon notice, Huntsville schools superintendent Dr. Casey Wardnyski told AL.com that Verizon’s “concern for education was dwarfed by some other concern.” It appears that Big V wasn’t thrilled that OmniLynx use had expanded beyond the borders of the Huntsville area. But Wardnyski says that view is “short-sighted” and that the intention was to always expand the program and offer unlimited data. “Verizon had the capability to limit the service area,” he explains. The school district tells WHNT that it will try to find another partner for the service. For its part, all Verizon has said thus far, is that “Verizon has and will continue to discuss this situation directly with Huntsville City Schools.” Verizon Makes HBO Now Available To FiOS Customers Verizon’s Go90 Mobile Streaming TV Service To Launch With Tiny Beta Test Verizon’s Refusal To Repair Landline Service Leaves Elderly Man Without Phone For Months Here Are The 13 Target Stores Closing In January Fired Taco Bell Executive Apologizes For Drunkenly Attacking Uber Driver Consumerist is currently testing a new user experience.
