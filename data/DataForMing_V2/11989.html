Very Large Aircraft Market Analysis: Why The Mini-Jumbos Are Closing In On The Superjumbos (Part 1) - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Airbus A380neo should decrease fuel burn by 10%. Airbus A380neo should be able to decrease fuel burn per seat by 14%. In one of my previous articles, I had a look at the upcoming performance upgrade for the Boeing (NYSE: BA ) 777. When the optional 14 seats are added, the Boeing 777 moves slightly more to the market where the superjumbos are operating. Although the superjumbos offer more (comfortable) pitches, airlines seem to be preferring the Boeing 777 and are adding seats to these airframes. For the Boeing 777-300ER, a configuration with 10 seats abreast is becoming the standard, leaving the Boeing 747-8I in the cold. In this series of articles, I will have a look at how airlines are using the mini-jumbos instead of the superjumbos, and see how it is affecting the costs and per seat figures. I will look at how the mini-jumbos are performing relative to the superjumbos. I will also incorporate possible changes to the Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSF / OTCPK:EADSY ) A380 and the announced changes to the current Boeing 777. I have performed a similar study in the past, but changes to the model used make it worth redoing the analysis. Secondly, new aircraft that have a market on the lower side of the VLA (Very Large Aircraft) market will be considered in this analysis as well. The following mission flight will be used: As the study itself is quite extensive, I will divide the presentation of results in several articles: Part 1 will look at the Airbus A380 and Airbus A380neo Part 2 will look at the Boeing 777-300ER PIP Part 3 will look at the Boeing 777-9X and Boeing 747-8I Part 4 will form a general conclusion and a more in-depth conclusion on why things are not working out In this part, I will deal with the Airbus A380 and Airbus A380neo. The Airbus A380 currently is the biggest passenger jet on offer and is popular among the Gulf carriers. For Airbus, however, the A380 is a disaster. The airplane is a prestige project and is not generating any profit for Airbus. Even if it will generate profit one day, the program is not going to be as successful as Airbus once thought it would be. Meanwhile, Emirates, the biggest operator of the Airbus A380, is pushing Airbus to come up with a re-engined version that burns 10% less fuel per seat. The Gulf carrier is claiming it will buy as much as 200 superjumbos if Airbus comes up with the Airbus A380neo. In one of my previous articles, I did a small study on the Airbus A380neo and concluded that new engines, winglets and additional seats were needed to achieve a 10% reduction in fuel burn. Figure 1 shows a short summary of the efficiencies of the Airbus A380neo (Source: Dhierin-Perkash Bechai) The Airbus A380neo features a higher propulsive and aerodynamic efficiency. The higher efficiencies will actively lower the fuel burn, while the higher capacity divides the fuel burn over more seats. The following seat counts will be used for the Airbus A380(neo): For our mission point, we obtain the following results: With jet fuel prices at $3 per gallon, the fuel costs are 9.1% lower for the Airbus A380neo, resulting in a 7% higher profit. The fuel consumption per 100 passenger-kilometer is 3.41 L for the Airbus A380 and 2.9 L for the Airbus A380neo. Using current fuel prices of approximately $1.70, the profit is about 5% higher for the Airbus A380neo.

However, making a quick calculation, using the 36 containers on the Airbus A380 and calculating the number of LD3 needed for carrying baggage (23), it can be concluded that the Airbus A380 has 13 LD3 containers available for the transportation of revenue generating belly freight. The Airbus A380neo is already a leap forward for operators, but this does not mean it is a winner. For airlines, it remains a challenge to fill the Airbus A380 and smaller, yet efficient, alternatives will be available soon. In Part 2, the Boeing 777-300ER along with its performance upgrade and optional seat addition will be analyzed and added to the comparison.
