Apple returns fire at Spotify, citing app rules violation - Spotify (Private:MUSIC) | Seeking Alpha Jul  1 2016, 14:37 ET | About: Spotify (MUSIC) | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Apple ( AAPL +0.4%) has launched a return salvo at Spotify (Private: MUSIC ) and its claims that Apple is acting anti-competitively , with a letter rejecting that charge . Apple's general counsel, Bruce Sewell, said in the letter that a rejection of an update to Spotify's app came due to a simple rules violation tied to in-app purchases. Subscription services must pay 30% of monthly fees to Apple if users sign up through the app, while they can avoid that 30% payment if their users sign up through companies' websites instead. But the companies cannot link to those other sites via their app, Sewell said. Spotify did that, and that's "a clear violation of the terms every other developer adheres to," Sewell wrote. “There is nothing in Apple’s conduct that ‘amounts to a violation of applicable antitrust laws,'” Sewell says. “Far from it.” What is good for all the geese must be good for all the ganders.....Spotify, aided by grandstanding Elizabeth Warren, herself stretching for a hot advocacy issue right now, got the megaphone yesterday.
