Intel 10-K disclosure points to end of historical "tick-tock" manufacturing cycle - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Mar 23 2016, 14:33 ET | About: Intel Corporation (INTC) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor "We expect to lengthen the amount of time we will utilize our 14 [nanometer] and out next-generation 10 [nanometer] process technologies, further optimizing out products and process technologies while meeting the yearly market cadence for product introductions," reads a disclosure uncovered in Intel's ( INTC -0.5%) 2015 10-K filing . Traditionally, Intel's "tick-tock" cycle has resulted in two CPU platforms being launched for each manufacturing process (e.g. 22nm, 14nm) the company adopts: An initial platform (tick) that delivers performance and power benefits from the higher transistor densities enabled by a moving an existing architecture to a newer process, and a brand-new architecture (tock) that optimizes Intel's use of the process. Typically, a full tick-tock cycle has lasted about two years before a new one starts. The 10-K disclosure and accompanying graphics suggest Intel is now willing to roll out three CPU platforms for a process. As it is, the company announced in July it's delaying the launch of its first 10nm CPU platform (Cannonlake, once expected in late 2016 or early 2017) to 2H17, and will instead roll out a third 14nm platform (Kaby Lake, succeeds Broadwell and Skylake) this year. Intel's strategy change could lower its capex needs - the company has already been investing conservatively in recent years. At the same time, it could give foundry providers TSMC, Samsung, and Globalfoundries a chance to eliminate Intel's historical manufacturing process edge. TSMC plans to begin production for its 10nm process (believed to have a lower transistor density than Intel's 10nm process) in Q4, and migrate to 7nm in 2018. Moore's "observation" has set the pace for technology development for decades... meanwhile you've just been cleverly sarcastic for a few years... That's correct. It has been discussed extensively over at semiwiki. They have even quoted, "The number of people who claim Moore's Law is dead doubles every year....... " Intel may have the "superior" 14 nm process based on technical specifications, but they cannot produce the yields to even satisfy the desktop/laptop market. TSMC and Samsung may have the inferior process, but far better yields. TSMC is rolling out InFO as Apple designs further architectural changes in the A10/A10X CPU at 16 nm. They are planning to move to 10 nm as quickly as they can. Intel's manufacturing process advantage is being destroyed. And the upcoming A10X may exceed the performance of the core i5 on CPU tasks. The A9X GPU already exceeds all Intel integrated GPUs. Just wait until Nvidia and AMD move their GPUs to the 14/16 nm process. Intel's GPU performance will be exposed for the pathetic performers they truly are. Moore's observation is a good one. I guess it could be considered a law. A law to be broken by none other than Intel itself.
