Yield (dividend / price) results from indexArb.com for 30 Dow industrial stocks as of market closing prices June 11 led to four actionable conclusions summarized above and detailed below. Investors have utilized Michael B. O'Higgins' dividend dog ranking system to select portfolios of five or ten stocks in the Dow Index to trade as of the last day in December since 1991, when he wrote the book "Beating The Dow" (HarperCollins). Thereafter, dog investors awaited annual results from their investments in the lowest-priced, highest-yielding stocks and trusted that the price of every stock they now owned would climb higher (having locked in a high yield percentage at purchase). Now named Dogs of the Dow . O'Higgins system works to find bargains in any collection of dividend paying stocks. Utilizing analyst price upside estimates has expanded the stock universe to include popular growth equities, if desired. McGraw Hill Financial , publisher of this index, states: The Dow, is a price-weighted measure of 30 U.S. blue-chip companies. The Dow covers all industries with the exception of transportation and utilities, which are covered by the Dow Jones Transportation Average and Dow Jones Utility Average. While stock selection is not governed by quantitative rules, a stock typically is added to The Dow® only if the company has an excellent reputation, demonstrates sustained growth and is of interest to a large number of investors. Maintaining adequate sector representation within the indices is also a consideration in the selection process." Top ten Dow dogs by yield from indexArb.com after May included seven of nine business sectors: technology; basic materials; services; conglomerates; industrial goods; consumer goods; and healthcare. (Financials were excluded and Dow rated Utilities in a separate index.) The indexArb chart included Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK ) in the top ten. Top ten Dow dogs by yield from Yahoo.com/Finance after May included seven of nine business sectors but dropped the second healthcare firm, Merck from the top ten, in favor of the tech firm, International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM ) in the technology sector. According to both indexArb.com and Yahoo.com, technology firm Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) [1] showed the best dividend yields as of market close June 11. One of two dogs in basic materials placed second, Chevron Corp. (NYSE: CVX ) [2]. A single services firm placed third, McDonald's (NYSE: MCD ) [3], per both ranking systems. Slots four to six showed different firms in each ranking system. The other basic materials outfit was fifth per indexArb and fourth per Yahoo, Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM ) [5][4], and the lone industrial goods firm took sixth per indexArb and fifth per Yahoo, General Electric (NYSE: GE ) [6][5]. A conglomerate placed fourth per indexArb while Yahoo had it ninth: Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT ) [4][9]. Slot seven spelled relief from the chaos in the form of Coca-Cola Co.(NYSE: KO ) [7] being there on both indexArb and Yahoo. One healthcare firm ranked ninth per indexArb and eighth per Yahoo: Pfizer (NYSE: PFE ) [9][8]. indexArb put a consumer goods stalwart in eighth place, while Yahoo put it sixth; Procter & Gamble. (NYSE: PG ) [8][6]. Lastly, indexArb placed Merck [10] in tenth, while Yahoo placed International Business Machines [10] in that slot to complete the dual June top ten Dow dividend dog lists. Relative strength by yield for the top ten Dow industrial index stocks was graphed below. Twelve periods of historic projected annual dividend history from $10,000 invested as $1k in each of the ten highest yielding stocks and the total single share price of those ten stocks created the data points for each period shown in blue for dividend and green for price. Actionable Conclusions: (1) Dow Top Dogs Retreated Most Bearishly into June per indexArb But (2) Showed As Mixed-Up per Yahoo! Finance Dow dogs retreated showing 2.2% less annual dividend from $10k invested as $1K in each of the top ten, while the aggregate single share price of the ten tumbled 15.7% between May 6 and June 11 by way of indexArb's replacing IBM in slot ten with MRK. Yahoo, however, projected a mixed-up scenario for the Dow dogs, showing 2.4% higher annual dividend from $10k invested as $1K in each of the top ten, while the aggregate single share price for the ten soared up 2.5% between May 6 and June 11 with IBM in slot 10. The difference between the indexArb retreating Dow and the Yahoo mixed-up Dow was caused by the share price and annual dividend for International Business Machines at $168.78/$5.20 leaving the indexArb side pushing price and dividend much higher on Yahoo. Thus indexArb results were driven into retreat by Merck's lower price and dividend at $60.26 /$1.86. Actionable Conclusion (3): Dow Dogs Are Overbought The Dow dogs overbought condition (in which aggregate single share price of the ten exceeded projected annual dividend from $1k invested in each of the ten) retreated on the indexArb chart but advanced on the Yahoo Finance graph from the record gaps set in May. The June gap fell to $367 or 79% on indexArb but soared to $415 or 118% per Yahoo. This gap between high share price and low dividend per $1k invested shows an overbought condition.
