Yet the importance of Apple to InvenSense is on the decline. A little over 2 years ago, I wrote What to Expect from InvenSense in 2014 , which correctly predicted the transition of InvenSense (NYSE: INVN ) from MEMs supplier to System-on-Chip designer. As products using the company's Firefly SoCs should begin to hit the market over the next few months, InvenSense is preparing to make new leaps forward. This article will detail what we can look forward to. For the moment, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) constitutes a large part (34%) of the InvenSense business, and an apparently larger share of investor attention. Although the win streak has continued , I've always downplayed the importance of this relationship, especially in light of my views on Apple's long-term prospects . In 2016, I think we can expect Apple's share of the overall business to continue to decline, and that's a good thing, as it will be mostly due to expansion into new markets: Toys and Drones: Although I've never expected drones to be a major market for InvenSense, they do represent some sales diversification. To that end, InvenSense has announced distribution agreements to build sales. Every little bit helps, and lots of different little bits can help a lot, as they tend to improve margins. Automotive: It's been just under a month since InvenSense announced its entry into the $5 trillion automotive market , but this article quotes Amir Panush, head of Automotive and Industrial Applications, as saying, "We have signed a deal with a Tier One partner." So it seems we might expect a formal announcement sooner rather than later. IHS sees MEMs for automotive applications as a $2.57b market this year. That's almost 7 times InvenSense's 2015 revenue, so the opportunity is significant. Animals: Nightwatch is a halter and collar system for monitoring horses which uses InvenSense technology. Although the volumes of this particular product will almost certainly never be meaningful on their own, that projection could change if solutions like this expand to more common pets and even livestock . The underlying company, Protequus , already notes the potential to "transform how we think about health & wellness monitoring in companion animals and livestock." As expected, a new software development platform has been announced to go with Firefly chips. The development tool set can make all the difference in the world in selling hardware and making design wins sticky. Perhaps some of the payments I've previously inferred from Apple are for a company-wide license for this tool? InvenSense has announced that Huawei is licensing the InvenSense Positioning Library for its Kirin 950 mobile application processor platforms. The Mate 8 flagship will be the first phone to use the enhanced navigation features. Huawei has been on a tear this year, growing faster than any other brand. It has claimed the top spot in Chinese market share and is now number 3 in sales worldwide, so this is a significant win. InvenSense has introduced a new cloud-based platform for fitness apps, called Coursa Sports . The platform seems to initially focus on better course tracking via the combination of sensors with GPS, rather than GPS alone. It's easy to see how that would add value, and how other applications such as improved heart rate monitoring are likely to follow. Of these, I think the last is potentially the most exciting. InvenSense now stands to make money not just from each device sold, but from each hour the devices are used. At 3 to 5 cents or more per hour per device, that could be a very powerful change in the sales model. I would hope to see a major partnership announced for Coursa in order to give it critical mass. As an example, if the ~2.5M people who bought Apple watches this year were to use them with Coursa for just one hour per week, that would represent over $5M in recurring annual revenue. Given that the Apple Watch is still just a small slice of a nascent market, the opportunity is significant. I further expect multi-function wearables to displace specialty fitness trackers in 2016 and beyond. Regardless of the actual adoption curve and revenue, I see Coursa as a learning experience for InvenSense. Industrial IoT applications would be an even better market for this model and involve revenue that could dwarf that of the mobile industry. One of the biggest challenges for ubiquitous adoption is securing the associated communications, and an exhibitor at the InvenSense Developer Conference showed how that could be done. Intrinsic-ID is partnering with InvenSense to implement the physically unclonable function (PUF) on the Firefly platform. This will provide individual chip-specific cryptographic security for IoT applications and will be available in early 2016. As a result, I expect that we will eventually see InvenSense offer industrial IoT data management platforms just as it has for fitness. Plans like that would dovetail very nicely with management statements that 80% of new design wins are outside mobile and the revenue potential of such offerings could be truly transformative. INVN's shares have declined of late as a result of the Apple weakness that I've long anticipated. However, the already overstated importance of this relationship is set to decline going forward. I've defended new management in the face of criticism and expect that its conservative guidance will continue to be the best predictor of near-term performance. That management has consistently grown both revenues and profits, so that the company now has a net of about $3 per share on the balance sheet . After subtracting that out, shares look cheap, with a hybrid P/E under 12. As a result, I expect my bottom call to hold up even in the face of continued market volatility. The InvenSense Developer Program continues to grow and now stands at over 30,000 programmers. I expect the open nature of this program and InvenSense platforms to continue to foster innovation and generate examples of new use cases that are difficult to even imagine, let alone predict. While a major partnership announcement could go a long way towards accelerating growth, the underlying technology and supporting platforms remain of paramount importance. The fingerprint and heart monitoring technology discussed in my last article show that InvenSense is delivering where it counts. Innovation, in the form of patented fabrication processes, is what gave InvenSense its start, and what will make or break it going forward, not a single customer or even market. I've long said that investors might have to wait until 2016, when Firefly starts seeing adoption, for the stock to see a real rebound. Nothing is assured, but that time is almost upon us.
