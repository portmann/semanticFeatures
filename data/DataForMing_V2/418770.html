Verizon, unions outline details of tentative deal - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha May 30 2016, 11:37 ET | About: Verizon Communications (VZ) | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor Nearly 40K striking Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) employees will return to work on Wednesday after reaching a tentative contract agreement that includes 1,300 new call center jobs, nearly 11% in raises over four years and the first contract for Verizon Wireless workers. The pact, announced by the Communications Workers of America union, stands to end a six-and-a-half-week work stoppage and one of the longest U.S. strikes in recent years. Previously: Verizon, unions come to terms on new four-year deal (May. 27 2016) I received wrong information from an overseas call center person whose lack of understanding English cost me money. When you get there ED, don't eat the food or drink the water, but still expect to lose that belly fat. Disagree.  I'm a teacher in a union state.  My teacher friends in non union states haven't had a pay raise in several years.  In some cases, they haven't received a raise in five years.  Some have even had to take pay cuts due to budget cuts.  Businesses and government will pay their people as little as possible in order to maximize profits.  Before you respond by saying that paying people well hurts the bottom line, I invite you to check out Starbucks and Costco.  Both companies pay their employees well and offer benefits as assistance with higher education expenses and seem to make a great deal of money. Not sure if you're talking to me, but our union and school system have a system in place where good teachers earn pay raises based on evaluations and things such as taking classes.  The evaluation process can be flawed because it assumed the admin doing the eval is competent, but it is different from when every teacher was given a raise simply for completing the school year.  Those that do extra work move up the pay scale faster. Dividend Bro - I have a philosophical difference of opinion with you and do not agree with Unions in general. When kids worked in mines in unsafe conditions - sure - union is required - most people do not need to be in a union now in my opinion. I can understand your point, but in my profession, it is much better and safer as an employee to be in a union.  That doesn't mean I agree with or think my union is the greatest thing since sliced bread.  But not getting a raise for five consecutive years while getting excellent evaluations and demonstrating your students are actually learning has been the case for several people I know that teach in Virginia and North Carolina. Nope, its a points system.  Higher the eval, more points.  After enough points, you get the step increase.  Enough bad evals and you are subject to termination. To a certain extent I would disagree with certain points.  Local school budgets are usually based upon the local area taxes and also some state subsidies  The school only has X amount of dollars to work with and when the negotiations for salary's come up everyone WANTS MORE.  In a lessor affluent community asking for a real estate increase is a failed preposition, couple that with the recent and in some places property values that have decreased and you reach an area where there is no money.  What to do, what to do?  Well teachers who have established tenure (status granted to an employee, usually after a probationary period, indicating that the position or employment is permanent.)  We have a problem.  Many districts have dropped that option and it makes (unqualified teachers) and there are some just like in any organization (roughly 20%) using the Pareto principle method to fully understand what I said.  This principle applies across  the board in any statistical measurement.  While the 20% may not exist in your particular organization it will across the board.  So we have the eval.   process, where the evaluator is immediately considered to be incompetent, but someone has to go, because well some want a raise or better benefits and the money available just is not there.  So what happens?  the school goes out on strike (except in some states) and the children suffer. In the Verizon deal the company can do many things.  Outsource, lay off people, do not replace retirees , raise rates.  Now I have relatives in non-union states who are teachers and based upon what they have said they have been receiving a raise in money or benefits.  I will say that the class sizes have increased and like anyone else they always want more.  But it is what it is.  Every situation is different and it depend upon which side of the fence you are on.  If you disagree you will use every negative statement or idea to support you idea's about it. Dividend Bro- "My teacher friends in non union states haven't had a pay raise in several years. In some cases, they haven't received a raise in five years. Some have even had to take pay cuts due to budget cuts." Welcome to the real world.  I've been retired for two years now, but for the last 9 years while employed with a company for 21 years I received no pay raise, and neither did any other employee.  In fact, during that 9 years, we all took a 10% pay cut to keep the company going, which it still is to this day.  It was at my recommendation as CFO to institute that 10% cut, as well as to eliminate the 401(k) matching contribution.  You do what you have to in order to survive.  Governments and their unions don't think they have that problem, since there is always a ready tax base just waiting to be tapped to keep their gravy trains going. Verizon should have spun off the wireless business at the outset. While the operations depend upon the wire end for selected transmissions, one would expect an arms length services contract in the best interest of both parties. Will be interesting to see where VZ opens come Tuesday morning. My guess, down and a rotation of income seekers into T. I retired from Verizon almost 20 years ago  with 30years of service. In that time  my shamefully small pension has been reduce each year because of as Verizon state "rising health care cost" This is a company that has  0 interest in its workers.   Keeping call centers in the U.S is very important to the workers and the customer .If you do not believe that   Call Frontier Communications .But take your blood pressure medicine first The Point is  Along with the jobs that are offshore go the paychecks.  Unfortunately without a union fighting to keep jobs in the US   those Call center Jobs would be going to India   That is 1,100 paychecks going back into our economy .
