Still A Fan Of China Mobile - China Mobile Limited (NYSE:CHL) | Seeking Alpha China Mobile is an attractive long-term investment. This article covers the reasons why, from market structure to valuation. China Mobile (NYSE: CHL ) is China's leading mobile operator, with a full 810 million mobile subscribers (at 2015-midpoint) or ~63% of China's entire mobile subscriber base. There are several reasons to be positive on the name and to consider it a very worthy long-term investment. This article will cover those reasons. First of all, the mobile market is a natural oligopoly. Useful electromagnetic spectrum is severely limited and its usage is thus regulated. As a result, there are always a limited number of competitors in the market at any one time. In China Mobile's case, the two main competitors are China Unicom (NYSE: CHU ) and China Telecom (NYSE: CHA ). To provide mobile service, a mobile operator has to cover the entire territory with cell towers. These and associated infrastructure mean that a large part of the investment and cost to provide mobile service is nearly fixed for all operators. I say "nearly" because there's some variation with the number of subscribers. Still, unless an operator sacrifices quality, a great deal of the cost needs to be borne by every operator no matter how many customers it has. Under these conditions, the mobile market gives rise to strong economies of scale. Those "nearly fixed" costs are spread over the subscriber base, and whoever has the most subscribers instantly turns into a cost leader. This has two consequences: The (market share) leader can already be more aggressive commercially if he needs to be so, since he intrinsically enjoys lower costs. As a result of this dynamic, the leader tends to continue leading. He can put more investment into its network while still being the cost leader, so he can provide more quality at a lower cost. Those in the U.S. will be familiar with the higher quality provided by Verizon (NYSE: VZ ), and how other operators usually seem to lag in coverage/quality. It's the same principle at work - Verizon is the leader in the U.S., so it can invest more while enjoying lower costs and higher margins. In China, China Mobile's leadership is even clearer, thus this effect is even stronger. As a result, China Mobile leads in costs, investment and margins. China's mobile market is now significantly penetrated - the number of mobile subscribers equals 95% of the population. As a result, subscriber and revenue growth have slowed considerably - which might have scared some investors away from China Mobile. However, there is a significant transition taking place right now. The market is shifting from 2G/3G services to 4G services. With this transition, voice service is losing significance and data service is gaining it. This transition has the potential to: Rekindle revenue growth, as the new services can lead to higher ARPU. Make for long-term growth in usage due to data usage. Increase the business value long-term, since data will more easily "fill up" the available spectrum, leading to more cases of premium pricing and premium margins. This dynamic will help all competitors, so as they see their own spectrum "fill up", they'll be a lot less inclined to still be commercially aggressive. China Mobile is a leader in the 4G transition as well. This isn't surprising - its market leadership simply allows it to invest more. The 4G transition also obfuscates the positive earnings and growth impact. The higher level of investment leads to higher depreciation charges (up 15% year-on-year during H1 2015) which in turn makes net profit stagnate (-0.8% year-on-year during H1 2015). This is misleading - EBITDA is a better measure of what's actually happening, and was up 7.2% year-on-year during H1 2015 (Source: China Mobile Interim Report 2015 ). Either way, China Mobile can handle any type of transition or investment. Due to its high margins and incredibly favorable market position, China Mobile has accumulated a massive treasure chest. Its balance sheet includes a full $68.8 billion in net cash. Moreover, China Mobile enjoys a 37.2% EBITDA margin, generating as much as $38 billion per year in growing EBITDA. This puts China Mobile's EV/EBITDA at 4.2x, which is incredibly low for any healthy company, never mind a distant leader in the massive Chinese wireless market. China Mobile also trades for 13x earnings, or 9.1x earnings if we exclude net cash. Both are extremely low for the high-quality business China Mobile is - and remember, earnings are somewhat misleading because they're being depressed by the 4G transition. How Will Outperformance Materialize? Beyond the high quality of the business and competitive position, another thing which stands out about China is the incredibly low ARPU (Average Revenue Per User). China Mobile had a mobile ARPU of ~$9.5/subscriber/month in H1 2015. As a matter of comparison, Verizon's ARPU runs at ~$50.7. Certainly, the U.S. is a much richer country and thus this gap is not surprising at this point. However, over time it's likely that these numbers will get closer given China's quicker (even if recently flagging) growth. Beyond increased usage, I believe the mechanism bringing both numbers closer will go somewhere along the lines of: China seeing more inflation than the U.S. Mobile service prices partially tracking this inflation. But the Chinese Yuan not tracking the inflation differentials. So, over time, the China Mobile ARPU in USD will climb steadily and reduce the difference to a typical U.S. ARPU. This in turn will highlight the fact that China Mobile has over 7x more subscribers than Verizon. The Chinese market (and economy) might be under pressure and this in turn can pressure Chinese ADRs quoted in the U.S. - of which China Mobile is an example. Thus, right now is not necessarily the best possible timing for a China Mobile investment, even though long term the stock seems like a very good investment. Those wanting a long-term investment will do well buying right away. Those trying to time it might wait for weakness and buy opportunistically. But do be aware that China Mobile is aggressively cheap even today -- this might affect timing considerations. Another associated problem is that the Chinese State might always choose to meddle in China Mobile's profitability. However, this would be hard to do, because lowering prices to absorb some of that profitability would wreck the other competitors. And even China won't be taxing one company more than the others. I have actually written on China Mobile's prospects in the past, namely in my article titled " A Tale Of 2 Giant Telecoms With Giant Yields ", where I recommended switching investments from Verizon to China Mobile. The reasoning was that China Mobile's prospects were better and its valuation was lower. Verizon, adjusted for dividends, was up 2.5% since that article was published. The S&P, a benchmark for Verizon, was up 26% in the same timeframe. Verizon underperformed the market it trades in by ~23.5%. The Hang Seng, a benchmark for China Mobile, was up just 4.5%. China Mobile outperformed the market it trades in by ~19.9%. What's more, the valuation differentials seen during my previous article have continued to be favorable for China Mobile in spite of its outperformance. Today, China Mobile goes for 4.2x EV/EBITDA while Verizon goes for ~6.4x. Also, the U.S. market turned much more competitive on account of T-Mobile's (NASDAQ: TMUS ) newfound aggressiveness . I continue to expect China Mobile to outperform Verizon going forward. I also expect China Mobile to perform well over the long term in absolute terms. China Mobile is an attractive long-term investment on account of its market position, margins, 4G transition and valuation. Switching investments from Verizon to China Mobile also continues to be an attractive trade. This is so in spite of China Mobile already having outperformed Verizon substantially since I last wrote about such a possibility.
