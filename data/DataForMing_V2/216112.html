Apple Earnings: China Headwinds Become A Gentle Breeze - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Analysts expect Apple September quarter revenue to come in above Apple's guidance. Expectations for iPhone sales are for about a 24% y/y increase. The effect of a China slowdown appears to be small, but investors will want to look carefully at Apple's regional results. Based on analyst consensus, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPhone sales and overall revenue will post gains of better than 20% y/y in the September quarter. If there is a headwind due to slow growth in China, it's hardly to be felt. Already, Apple bears are trying to redirect the attention of investors to the December quarter, when comps are expected to be tougher. However, investors should focus on key elements of Apple's earnings report due on Tuesday as it will contain the best indicators of next quarter's performance. As we've gotten closer to Apple's earnings report, analyst estimates have brightened up considerably. In a research note issued on Friday, October 23, Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster reported general investor expectations of $51 billion in revenue and 47.8 million iPhone unit sales. Philip Elmer-Dewitt's tabulation of analysts' estimates for iPhone came to an average of 48.72 milion, a y/y increase of 24%. This quarter, I'm trying to curb my enthusiasm, so I'm going with the analyst average of 48.7 for iPhone sales. In my model, I nevertheless obtain higher revenue than the upper end of Apple's guidance last quarter of $51 billion, primarily due to the revenue boost for Apple Watch. As I stated in my last article on Watch , I expect revenue due to the estimated four million Watch sales to be about $1.8 billion. Mac unit sales are basically what Gartner research predicts, as I discussed in my recent Mac market share article . I expect iPad sales to continue to decline, since there was little new that was introduced in the September quarter, except the updated iPad Mini. I expect the iPad Pro to reverse the sales decline at least for the December quarter. Operating margin is a little below normal for the past few quarters. Here, I'm just going with the low end of Apple's guidance for the operating cost range of $5.85-$5.95 billion. This represents a fairly steep ramp in R&D spending to $2.2 billion for the quarter, a 30.5% y/y increase. Increased R&D spending is always good news as far as I'm concerned, and I don't get concerned about it hurting operating margin. The Chinese economy is slowing down, but it's not crashing. In a preview of Q3 stats, Reuters reported that China's GDP will grow at 6.8%. In Q2, the Chinese government reported a GDP growth rate of 7%. And of course there are the usual caveats about the reliability of Chinese government statistics. I've been saying for some time that I thought the concern about China was overdone, and based on analyst expectations for the September quarter, that appears to be the case. But I acknowledge there's still reason to be alert to the impact of a further China slowdown. Of all the things that Apple investors will want to pay attention to, the regional revenue for Greater China may be the most important. Greater China revenue in the June quarter was $13.2 billion, a sequential decrease of 21% but a y/y increase of 112%. The crucial indicator will be sequential movement of Greater China revenue relative to total revenue. My predicted total revenue for the quarter represents a 5.9% sequential gain. If Greater China comes in with anywhere from 0-6% sequential growth, that's a big win for Apple. Even 0% sequential growth represents 128% y/y growth. China (People's Republic, not Greater China) was part of the first wave for the iPhone 6s launch this year, in contrast to last year. So I consider the chances of sequential growth greater than 0% to be very good. Even a slight sequential decline would not be dire news if Apple's overall sales are strong. Clearly this is something that will attract a lot of attention and I'll be looking very carefully at the numbers Apple reports for Greater China. I continue to expect Apple to be relatively immune to an economic slowdown in China due to Apple's status as an aspirational brand. In the U.S., Apple is just another consumer brand, albeit one with a high reputation for quality. But it's not out of reach for most U.S. consumers. In China, Apple products are still beyond the reach of the majority. iPhone is set apart from the mass of "white box" Android smartphones by Apple's brick and mortar retail presence, it's reputation for quality and the operating system support Apple provides to all its devices. iPhone sales are being fueled by upgraders leaving behind their Android phones, even as the China commodity smartphone market stagnates. China's economy would have to be in a true recession to stifle this trend. Lately we've been seeing media focus shift from September quarter results to the December quarter, even before Apple's report on the September quarter. This shift in focus can be seen in articles by SA contributors Michael Blair and WestEnd511 . If one is to make the bear case against Apple, it probably has to be made on the basis of expectations for the December quarter. I doubt there's a philosopher's stone of sufficient potency to transmute the good news of the September quarter into bad news to the bears' liking. The bears are getting ahead of themselves. I expect the results of the September quarter to demonstrate once again that the Apple bears simply don't understand Apple. They don't understand the appeal of the iPhone or other Apple products. Invariably, they assume that the popularity of Apple products is due to some trick of brand appeal or fad. How many times have we heard an Apple bear repeat the formula "Apple's only real asset is its brand." If Apple's revenue comes in at the consensus, Apple's y/y growth will have been a phenomenal 20+%. Will the market reward Apple with a pop as it did for Microsoft's 12% revenue decline? Probably not. The bearish sentiment and lack of understanding of Apple are still very prevalent. Once Apple reports earnings for the September quarter and provides guidance for the December quarter, then it will be time to start to think in detail about Apple's performance in the next quarter.
