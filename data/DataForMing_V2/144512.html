Ford Is Priced As Though It Is Shrinking - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford reported a blowout Q2 but investors have sold the bounce once again. Shares are now trading for just 7.7 times forward earnings, incredible for a company that just reported record profits. I think investors will wake up at some point and own Ford but for now, I think holding is still more than warranted. I've been a long time bull on Ford (NYSE: F ) as I think the company's new product offerings as well as its valuation make a compelling case for long term value. Most recently I outlined why I think Ford is the better choice against Fiat Chrysler (NYSE: FCAU ) as the latter trades at an enormous premium to Ford for reasons that are unclear to me. The company reported a very strong Q2 at the end of July and although investors originally bought the results, that buying pressure was quickly squashed and we find the stock down again. In light of Ford's seemingly constant starts and stops I'll take a fresh look at the company's valuation following its huge Q2 to see if we may see a sustained rally at some point in the near future. To do this I'll use a DCF-type model you can read more about here . The model uses several inputs including earnings estimates, which I've borrowed from Yahoo! , dividends, which I've set to grow at 15% annually, and a discount rate, which I've set at the 5 year Treasury rate plus a risk premium of 7%. I've changed things up here with my model; instead of finding the current fair value based upon the usual inputs I've instead changed the out years' earnings growth estimates to make the model return the current stock price. In other words, I've worked backwards to understand what the market is pricing in so that we may evaluate the reasonableness of current expectations. Ford reported a blowout quarter in Q2, beating EPS and revenue by wide margins. The company showed broad strength with its new products and investors couldn't have asked for more. In addition to very strong revenue the company's margins rose sharply as well. Operating margins were up 60 bps and on a base of 660 bps, that's an enormous increase. That powered Ford to a record profit in Q2 as strong volume and pricing paved the way for an outstanding quarter. Much of my bullishness on Ford stems from the company's new product offerings and namely, the F Series. This model has long been the backbone of Ford's operating profits and the new F Series was a huge step forward (and risk) for Ford. The aluminum body was something that hasn't been tried before and while the fuel savings are measurable, with low gas prices I was concerned some truck buyers wouldn't see the value. Fortunately buyers have seen the value in the redesigned F Series and are buying it in droves. Ford sold more than 66,000 F Series trucks in July as pricing remains strong, boosting margins. In fact, it is selling them so quickly it has hired a second supplier to build frames for the truck because it cannot currently keep up with demand. If that isn't a sign of strong demand, I'm not sure what is. And given that margins are great on the F Series the fact that the company is selling so many is great not only for revenue but profits as well. We saw this in Q2 and if July is any indication, Q3 will be similar. And for those that thought aluminum bodied trucks weren't as safe as their steel counterparts, recent testing put that concern to bed. Hopefully this will assuage some of the (unfounded) fears consumers had regarding the aluminum bodied truck and could be a catalyst for incrementally higher sales in the near term. Back to the model, according to my calculations, Ford shares are pricing in earnings growth in 2017 and beyond of negative 8.5%. In other words, I believe the stock is currently pricing in lower EPS in 2020 than this year and if that sounds crazy to you, perhaps a long position in Ford sounds more palatable. Given the momentum Ford has exhibited and the simple fact that its new product offerings are leading to record profit levels, I simply can't understand why someone would think Ford is worth so little. The stock is priced currently as though the F Series was a huge failure which, in light of strong evidence, is obviously far from the truth. The stock is now trading for 7.7 times forward earnings, an incredible number that is normally assigned to companies that are deteriorating towards bankruptcy. To the contrary, Ford is posting record numbers and yet, receives no love from investors. I have to think this situation will be resolved at some point as disbelievers are proven wrong over and over again and that is why I'm sticking to my bullish position here; there is simply too much evidence that Ford is going to continue to make lots of money for me to sell. And if value stocks aren't for you, at least consider the company's 4.2% yield. That level gives Ford one of the best yields among large caps in the entire market and with the business producing very strong results, the payout will almost certainly continue to grow. I'm perplexed by the perpetual undervaluation of Ford but I am confident investors will see the light at some point. The business is simply too strong to ignore and I find currently priced expectations to be ludicrous. I'm long. Disclosure: I am/we are long F.
