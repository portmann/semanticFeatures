The Last Time Verizon Had A 5% Dividend Yield - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha This commentary details the last time that shares of Verizon traded with a 5% dividend yield. When that occurred, the investment provided 8% annualized returns moving forward. This doesn't mean this will happen again, but it does provide a context from which you can think about today's investment proposition. On September 22, 2015, shares of telecommunications giant Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) closed at a price just under $44.50. For a brief moment shares could have been purchased at a lower price, but otherwise this marks a low for the year. In addition, the company recently announced a $0.565 quarterly dividend , or $2.26 on an annual basis. Ordinarily a "current" yield isn't especially current given the nature of the dividend increase timing, but in this instance both are the same. The quoted yearly dividend is $2.26, and indeed you would expect to receive this amount in the coming year if you bought shares today. Based on the above dividend and price, this equates to a dividend yield of about 5.1%, which brings up a natural question: "when was the last time Verizon had a 5% yield." During the first half of 2014, Verizon was paying $0.53 per quarter, or $2.12 on an annual basis. During the second half of 2014, the company was paying a $0.55 quarterly dividend, or $2.20 on an annual basis. Thus the share price would need to be at $44 or below in order to provide a 5% yield. The low price for the year happened to be above $45, so the 5% threshold was not reached. In 2013, the company paid quarterly dividends of $0.515 during the first half and the same $0.53 that lead into 2014 during the second half. These payouts result in a needed price of about $42 and $41 to meet the 5% dividend yield mark. The low price for the year reached just over $41, but it occurred during the first part of the year - once more the 5% threshold was not crossed. In 2012, VZ paid quarterly dividends of $0.515 and $0.50, resulting in needed share price points of about $41 and $40. In April of 2012, shares were trading around $40 per share. As such, the last time Verizon had a 5% dividend yield was at this time. Now, let's see what's happened since then. Today, shares of Verizon trade around $44.50. Expressed differently, an investor who purchased shares back in April of 2012 would now be sitting on $4.50 worth of capital appreciation - representing just 3.2% annualized gains. Of course, there can be a large difference between what you see in a stock chart and what actually occurs with your investing returns. For the rest of 2012, you would have collected $1.53 in dividend payments. During 2013, you would have collected $2.09 in payouts. Over the course of 2014, you would have received $2.16 in dividends. And, so far this year, you would have a claim on $1.67 worth of payments. All told, you would have collected $7.45 in per share dividend payments. If you add in these payments, suddenly your return jumps to 8% per year. So it's short history, but the last time that Verizon traded with a 5% yield, shares turned in 8% annualized gains three and a half years later. This is the type of thing that might not be readily observable in a stock chart. And keep in mind that this represents a higher-than-normal dividend yield; with a lower yield the returns would have been greater. Without doing anything on your part, your dividend income went from $0.50 per quarter to today's mark of $0.565 - a 13% gain over the period. Had you reinvested along the way, you now might be sitting on perhaps 17% more shares, which in turn would result in the expectation of receiving 30% more income this year than when you started in 2012. It's often underrated, but good things tend to happen when you reinvest into an above-average yield - moderate per share growth turns into solid total income growth. Naturally there's a problem with comparing past yields (situations change), but this might not be as a large of an issue on this instance. The payout ratio based on adjusted earnings is actually lower today, effectively indicating that today's yield could perhaps be a bit more impressive than in the past. Regardless, it's important to think about this component of return in both a historical and forward-looking sense. In viewing the past, I would contend that it's more of a checkpoint rather than an absolute. Knowing that Verizon previously had a 5% yield and delivered reasonable returns in the past is analogous to remembering that you jumped in the deep end of the pool and you are still here to talk about it. It's useful to know that it happened in the past and is not an unprecedented event. It's not useful in that you can use this as a precise indicator of what is to come, things change and there are far too many variables at play. So let's think about the future in a slightly different light. Analysts are presently expecting intermediate-term growth to be in the mid-single digits. Let's scale it back a bit and suggest that both earnings and the dividend can grow by 3% annually. After five years, this would equate to a future dividend of $2.54. Now here's where the dividend yield comes into play. Naturally it's possible that Verizon could trade with a greater yield in the future. Yet, if you believe that a 5% yield happens to be on the higher side, this indicates that share price growth will be equal to or greater than dividend growth. Over the period you would expect to collect $12 per share in dividends or so during the five-year period. Your total expected return is dependent on the dividends received along with the future share price. The future share price can be computed by either using a P/E ratio or a future dividend yield. Here's a look at anticipated five-year annualized returns for Verizon based on varying future dividend yields: During the past decade, shares of Verizon have traded with an average dividend yield in the 4% to 6% range. This is what is described above. Obviously something below this would result in higher returns while something higher would result in lower returns. As it stands, the above table provides a reasonable range of possibilities. If you believe a yield in the 4% to 5% range is most realistic, you're looking at expected returns in the 7% to 11% range. Alternatively, if you believe that shares ought to trade with a yield above 5%, you start to move to yearly returns that are "just" in the mid-single digits. In short, the last time that Verizon had a 5% dividend yield, the security provided 8% annualized gains. Gains, by the way, that weren't readily noticeable on a stock chart. Of course that's not to suggest that this absolutely must occur in the future. Yet, in reviewing potential returns, it doesn't appear to be an altogether imprudent assumption either. If Verizon has a lower yield in the future, as has often been the case, investors stand to collect a 5% and growing starting dividend with the possibility of reasonable or better overall returns to boot.
