S&P 500 Earnings: Ultimately, Technology And Financial Sectors Will Drive The S&P 500 - SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) | Seeking Alpha Outside Year? See Josh Brown via SeeItMarket here . Both of these articles are pretty bullish. The point in linking to these articles is that technical analysis is supporting what I think will be improved earnings growth in the S&P 500. Doing this weekend's S&P 500 Earnings Update, a thousand different articles come to mind just running through the numbers. Here is the S&P 500 by Market Cap and Earnings Weight, a table that readers see at least once a quarter: 1.) Note how the "earnings weight" of Financials within the S&P 500 has grown, while the market cap as a percentage of the S&P 500 has shrunk. Financials are the worst performing sector year-to-date and frankly in my opinion remain one of the best values in terms of sectors within the S&P 500, but the flat yield curve and the regulatory environment aren't giving them much of a chance to grow earnings. 2.) If you don't think Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is important to the S&P 500, check the change in Technology's "earnings weight" between March and July '16, after Apple reported one of its worst quarters and analysts took down numbers. Technology's earnings weight within the S&P 500 dropped from 24% to 19% in a period of 3 months. As a numbers geek that tracks this stuff religiously, that even surprised me. (Long Apple) Per Factset's weekend Earnings Insight, if Apple is excluded from the Q2 '16 Technology sector, expected earnings growth for the sector improves to -1%, What is a little bit less surprising but still notable is that Tech's market cap weight is roughly the same within the S&P 500 between July '15 and July '16 even though Apple has declined from $135 per share to roughly $97-$98 per share in the last 12 months. Conclusion: This is a big week for Financials with a bunch of banks reporting late in the week. Financials and Tech are the two gorilla sectors within the S&P 500. In an article read this week, someone trumpeted that Healthcare's market cap weight as a sector was now equal to that of Financials', but of notice the earnings weight, there is still a big disparity between the two. Financials still trumps Health Care by 450 basis points in terms of earnings weight. In the bull market of 2013, where the S&P 500 returned better than 32% for the calendar year, Financials were the top performing sector. Truly makes me wonder about the "chicken-or-the-egg" question. The flattening yield curve and the mortgage refi's has to be killing a name like Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC ) (long WFC). JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM ) should benefit in Q2 '16 from the better high-yield credit market, and the improved commodity sectors in Q2 '16. Because Energy and commodities bottomed in Q1 '16 and improved throughout Q2 '16 as did high yield credit spreads, and better bond issuance, I do think this helped take some stress off the credit/loan books of the banking industry. We'll see some of the big bank/Financials numbers this week. Both Tech and Financial sectors remain 35% of the S&P 500's market cap and 40% of its earnings weight.
