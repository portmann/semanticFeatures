The Growth "Story" Is Over: Amazon Authorizes $5 Billion Stock Buyback | Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! After the recent Amazon earnings, which were not bad at all, but which put a lid on the company's growth expectations, there was just one thing missing: the same thing that capped Apple's own growth, and creativity: a stock buyback. Well, we just got it. On February 10, 2016, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $5 billion of the Company's common stock. The program allows the Company to repurchase its shares opportunistically from time to time when it believes that doing so would enhance long-term shareholder value. The repurchase authorization does not have a fixed expiration. Purchases may be effected through one or more open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, transactions structured through investment banking institutions, or a combination of the foregoing. This stock repurchase authorization replaces the previous $2 billion stock repurchase authorization, approved by the Board of Directors in 2010. And just like that AMZN joins the vaunted AAPL club in admitting it is fresh out of organic growth ideas, and will resort to balance sheet alchemy to boost its price higher over the foreseeable future, ostensibly first using cash and then debt, to raise the funds needed to buyback stock. Any immediate spikes in the stock will be faded fast and furious. Wed, 02/10/2016 - 16:12 | 7167028 EscapeKey Wed, 02/10/2016 - 16:18 | 7167092 Quasi Can I buy AMZN on Amazon?

The insiders need to sell to somebody!   UNLOAD THEM SHARES!!!  More boats to ski behind, more vacation houses, more more more!!!  Who needs company cash reserves.   weeeeeeeeeeeee Wed, 02/10/2016 - 16:31 | 7167185 TwoHoot In a ZIRP/NIRP world, holding cash costs money. Stock buybacks make more sense than buying the stocks and bonds of other companies because the money stays at home in the corp treasury.

Wed, 02/10/2016 - 16:47 | 7167310 Bobportlandor Q. Doesn't buybacks reduce the shares issued, thus supporting the company share price which in turn supports the market indices. If so, then comparing today's market indices price with historical prices needs to take this into account. With all the buybacks going on the market price today would be lower if the same shares outstanding say in 2007 was used. Wed, 02/10/2016 - 16:53 | 7167346 bbq on whitehou...
