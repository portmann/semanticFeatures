Can Verizon Sustain Its Dividend Yield? - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha Verizon had much more pricing leverage than originally anticipated. When peers in the telecom space are either reporting declining ROIC, non-existent ROIC or negative ROIC, Verizon is expected to sustain improvements in ROIC. This is driven by the company's ability to maintain profitability while it works to de-leverage the balance sheet all while maintaining its dividend and share repurchase program. With the conversion of its spare spectrum to 4G LTE, Verizon seems well positioned for impending data usage growth. Furthermore, FCF margins are starting to tick higher on the basis of stronger operating metrics, which indicates that dividend yield growth is at least sustainable when compared to peers. The telecoms' return on invested capital continued to decline across the board with the exception of Verizon (NYSE: VZ ). Initially, it was thought that the competitive dynamics of the space would reduce ARPU significantly and thus reduce operating metrics to a point where Verizon would no longer be able to sustain its dividend payout ratios The main reason why investors like Verizon is because of the predictability of its revenue and earnings, which has consistently allowed Verizon to raise its dividend yield over the past five years. The dividend has grown 2.93% on an annualized basis over the trailing five-year period. Therefore, to sustain the current dividend yield growth the company must grow its EPS and its revenue on a continued basis. Based on the company's most recent quarterly earnings report, the company seems to have much more pricing leverage than initially anticipated. This is mostly driven by the adoption of 4G LTE devices, and the growth in retail prepaid connections. The company mentioned that on an adjusted basis EPS grew by 12%, which was driven by a transaction that inflated EPS in the prior year. With those adjustments in mind, the company seems to be well positioned to continue its 4G LTE rollout, which isn't at full saturation quite yet. In fact the company mentions that only 40% of its spectrum is being utilized by the LTE network. Furthermore, the company has plans to enter into the OTT space by providing live events pertaining to sports broadcasting via ESPN and CBS. The company also plans to integrate Huffington Post and various other properties pertaining to the AOL transaction to drive growth in OTT. With an a la carte TV service, the company is disrupting its own business model, but to a lesser extent and with favorable margin impact. The company has relatively little saturation of its wireline business throughout the United States, but has a lot of upside if in the event they are able to sell more programming to mobile devices as a part of the data package. There aren't any geographic restrictions with selling OTT services vs. packaged channels. Furthermore growth seems to be sustainable so as long as there are additional connections to other devices like tablets and wearable devices. The company has been able to sustain its pricing leverage and reduces churn rate in the previous quarter, which has created less fear or speculation over competitive threats. When taking in all these factors, it seems Verizon has a durable competitive advantage. Also, the growth strategy and the deleveraging of its balance sheet reduces any speculation of the long-term viability of its dividend and capital return program going forward. When looking at the trailing 12-month period, the only two companies that have been able to sustain a dividend payout have been Verizon and AT&T (NYSE: T ). This corresponds to the fact that both companies have strong networks and a loyal subscriber base relative to peers. In other words, network quality seems to be the most important aspect of subscriber retention. This is driven by the fact that communications-related services tend to be inelastic, i.e. insensitive to pricing. Therefore, competing on price was never a sustainable strategy. I anticipate that Verizon will add mobile subscribers, but revenue growth will be slightly mitigated due to the reduction in revenue pertaining to handset sales as it's not recognizable under the Verizon Edge plan. These prepaid mobile plans offer upside because Verizon is no longer subsidizing the cost of handsets. This improves EBITDA, which will correspondingly improve the return on invested capital going forward. As you can tell, the net debt to adjusted EBITDA has remained stable throughout the year. However, sales growth and earnings growth have been rather robust. The company believes that it can sustain its profitability expansion despite unionized contract negotiations by reducing headcount and sustaining greater efficiencies in the way they manage their OpEx. Furthermore, the company has sustained economies of scale with regard to its network buildout. Particularly there are a lot of synergies in the wireline and wireless business which has reduced the competitive threat in the Northeastern markets. In those markets, there's a higher population density, which allows lower tier networks like Sprint (NYSE: S ) and T-Mobile (NYSE: TMUS ) to compete both on pricing and network quality. However, because Verizon is able to bundle both broadband and wireless into a single package they are able to fend off more desirable markets through a mix of features and pricing. The stock has been relatively resilient in the face of the recent market selloff, as indicated in the above graph. For more defensive oriented investors who want to collect a stable dividend yield, Verizon seems to be a pretty compelling investment. Due to decent growth metrics, the company can sustain capital returns in the form of dividends but also reduce the balance sheet risk pertaining to its transaction with Vodafone, which was valued at $130 billion. Correspondingly long-term debt increased from $51.987 billion in fiscal year 2012 to $110 billion in fiscal year 2014 (the year in which the transaction closed). Since the close of the transaction debt levels have declined slightly to $109 billion. In other words, Verizon balances its financial risks and competitive risks while also pursuing relatively realistic growth strategies. This makes for a pretty solid investment due to the durability of earnings. So, over the long haul I anticipate Verizon to sustain its annualized dividend yield growth of 2.93% and will sustain its 4.77% dividend yield for the foreseeable future. The stock is much more of a defensive play so unlike technology names it probably won't exhibit the same level of price momentum, but at the same time it's a safe haven during periods of market volatility and will mitigate portfolio volatility. Therefore I continue to reiterate my buy recommendation on Verizon. As I have already mentioned throughout the entire article: earnings seem durable, competitive moat is strong, and yield growth is highly likely.
