Disney: Is The Recent Selloff An Opportunity? - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha We believe Disney is worth at least $85 per share. The company has numerous catalysts in the years ahead. Disney (NYSE: DIS ) took a bit of a hit in August with shares declining over 20% (peak to trough). The market appeared to be concerned with CFO, Christine McCarthy's, remarks that they expected ESPN subscriptions to decline 1% in 2016. We'll take a look at how this really effects Disney and then we'll discuss whether the market is providing us a big enough discount from Disney's intrinsic value to justify investment. The media networks segment at Disney accounts for ~43% of revenue. It's no surprise that the market panicked on the word of subscription drops from the best driver in the segment. However, let's put things in perspective. Yes, ESPN subscriptions will likely decline. However, the segment as a whole should continue to grow. In fact, even in the face of lost ESPN subscription, revenue did increase. And the 6% increase in affiliate fee revenue was tied to an increase in affiliate rates and subscriber growth (mainly SEC network) -- these two things are likely to continue over time. The affiliate fee is what the cable providers pay the network to show their channels. A disruption in affiliate fees could have a huge impact on the free cash levels of Disney. However, the Media Network segment, as a whole, is still growing…crisis averted for now. 2015 was off to a great start with the success of Frozen. We anticipate that there will be many more successes in movies franchises in the coming years. This will help bolster and grow earnings over time. Given the high quality nature of the business and various catalysts (which we'll discuss in a moment), there is reason to believe that bottom and top line will continue grow in the 5-10% and 10-15% range in the coming years. Disney is combining its merchandising and digital units into one operating segment. Digital entertainment is increasingly becoming a part of Disney's merchandise. Disney is being proactive in their response to this growing and evolving trend. The new segment, Disney Consumer Products and Interactive (DCPI), we help strengthen an already strong brand and allow the company to focus on product development with technology. Investors are happy to point to numerous catalysts in the coming years, the main catalyst being the monetization of the $4.05 billion LucasFilm acquisition in 2012. Disney has already disclosed that they intend to produce five Star Wars movies by 2020 --- trilogy of the main Stars Wars storyline and two spin-offs. For you fellow Stars Wars fans, it should be a good five year stretch! :) It should be mentioned that Disney has been able to successfully monetize two other big acquisitions: Marvel and Pixar. We all know the success these franchises have had, and continue, to have globally. The LucasFilm franchise should be no different. Disney is incredibly shareholder friendly. Recently, the board announce it will start paying a semi-annual dividend. The announcement of the semi-annual dividend policy came with a 15% jump in dividend payments as well on an annualized basis. The company has repurchased ~$20 billion of stock in the last five years. We expect share repurchases to continue over time. On the valuation front, Disney sports a P/FCF of 28.83 (FCF yield of 3.46%), EV/EBIT of 14.98, forward P/E of 19.72, P/S of 3.69, and a dividend yield of 1.66%. The job of every great investor is to translate reported GAAP earnings of the business into real economic earnings (free cash flow or owner earnings). The durability of those real economic earnings is the next (usually most important) step. Although sustainable competitive advantages can be difficult to pinpoint, it's extremely important to establish. Since the future is inherently unknown and unpredictable (to any high degree of probability). And because we weren't blessed with a crystal ball, we believe a margin of safety is ESSENTIAL in every investment. A larger margin of safety is recommended for lower quality investments (larger discount between current prices and the Intrinsic Value of the Business). A higher quality business or investment doesn't necessary require a large discount to intrinsic value if you expect (with a high degree of probability) that returns will be realized shortly or returns of the business will compound over time. Regarding valuation, margin of safety can be accomplished in one of two ways (or both for that matter): 1) Purchasing the conservative estimate of future free cash flows of the business at a discount 2) Purchasing a business below its liquidation value with favorable earnings power in 3-5 years. In the case of Disney, we will be valuing the business based on its discounted future free cash flows to determine if there is a margin of safety. In valuing any business, it's important to focus on free cash flow (as well as the durability of its competitive position). In valuing Disney, let's start with the FCF number. Disney had Cash Flow from Operations of $9.78 billion in 2014. Capital expenditures for the year were $3.31 billion. The "back of the envelope" net free cash flow was about $6.47 billion (roughly in line with reported net income). It's important to note, growth investments kept capex elevated at $3.31 billion. This is significantly higher than the D&A of $2.28 billion. If we use D&A as a proxy for maintenance capex, it would generate a FCF number closer to ~$7.50 billion --- meaning FCF could be significantly higher than our conservative estimates. Over the last 10, 5, and 1 year periods, Disney grew free cash flow annually 8.90%, 15.20%, and 9.80% respectively. And in the process, Disney has continuously grown earnings while achieving 11-16% return on equity and 9-13% returns on invested capital over the last 5 years. It appears Capex has remained relatively stable at 5-9% of revenue. Disney operates in a non-cyclical industry and a large moat compared to other competitors. Normally, we'd use a trough FCF figure or a 3-5 year average of FCF. However, in this case the TTM figure of $6.52 billion of FCF will help serve our point. We will use a conservative discount rate of 10%, given the stable nature of the business. And even after all the DCF projections, the business is still worth something at the end of the day (all else being equal). As a result, we assume that the business is sold at the end of the year 10 at a conservative 10x FCF plus any excess capital in the business. Disney has ~$45 billion in book value ($4.47 billion in cash). We'll be very conservative and only use cash for excess capital. We believe that management will continue to repurchase shares (which may not be a great idea at current levels). However, we'll use current shares outstanding of 1.71 billion in our calculation. Based on these numbers, and to be very conservative, we will come up with 3 growth scenarios for Disney over the next 10 years. We'll also give a probability weight based on the likelihood of each scenario. Let's look at the three scenarios below using these various assumptions, and see how we were able to arrive at a fairly conservative estimate of intrinsic value using a range of values and probability of the scenarios playing out: The discounted values of Disney range from $54.09 to $97.57. The stock is trading ~$113 per share which no margin of safety to our high-range assumptions. We believe the most likely scenario is 5-10% growth in FCF for the foreseeable future, which is why we weighted scenario #2 and #3 at 80% probability. This gives us a weighted intrinsic value of $78.78 per share. In other words, if all of our assumptions came to fruition, an investor buying Disney today at $78.78 could expect a 10% annualized rate of return over the next 10 years. With shares trading at ~$113 per share, current share prices appear to be overvalued. The recent concern over ESPN subscription losses was overblown. However, with shares trading at a FCF yield of 3.46%, we find Disney shares unappealing at current levels as an investment (despite our deep admiration for the company). Shares would have to drop considerably to offer us the margin of safety we seek in our investments. We expect Disney to do quite well in the coming years, so we may not get that opportunity. With that said, we would not sell the stock if we were long at lower levels. This is a 'compounder' that is likely to do very well over the next 10-30 years with their intellectual property and numerous competitive advantages.
