Just When You Thought Windstream Couldn't Do Any Worse - Windstream Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:WIN) | Seeking Alpha This sounds like a great plan, but Windstream investors need a reality check. Even if we pretend this deal is done, Windstream still has a heavy debt load. Windstream's customers are leaving, there is no way around it. What's wrong with this picture? You've found a stock with a yield of more than 12%. The company has somehow managed to keep its dividend intact, even while two of its peers have cut their payouts in the last few years. In addition, the company says it's going to split into two, keep paying a large dividend, and it will become more competitive in the future. Unfortunately, as the old saying goes, if it sounds too good to be true, it usually is. The company in question is Windstream Holdings (NASDAQ: WIN ). The stock currently yields more than 12%, and even after the proposed split, the expected yield will still exceed 8% . The idea is Windstream will spin-off a REIT, and along with it some of the parent company's debt, and real estate holdings. The remaining Windstream company in theory will have a better debt profile, and will be able to compete more effectively. The company's REIT will theoretically be able to pursue more diversified holdings and investors could benefit from a diverse real estate portfolio. There is just one big problem, namely Windstream's interest expense. The company competes against local telecom players like Frontier Communications (NASDAQ: FTR ) and larger wireless and local telecom players like Verizon (NYSE: VZ ). Current Windstream shareholders need to accept that if they hold both the parent stock and the REIT that they still carry the burdens of both. Given this reality, it only makes sense to look at Windstream's interest expense compared to its peers. Of the three companies, Verizon's interest cost is relatively the lowest. In the last quarter, Verizon's interest expense as a percentage of operating income was just 25% on a normalized basis. Frontier on the other hand, spent 77% of its operating income on interest income. By comparison, Windstream's most recent quarter witnessed the company use 101% of its operating income on interest . Unfortunately for investors, this percentage is even after subtracting Windstream's pension expense. No matter how you look at it, Windstream has a problem with debt and this separation will not change the overall issue. Just for a minute, let's pretend that Windstream's spin-off has already happened. Beyond this, we also have to pretend that Windstream has successfully been able to sell the 20% of its REIT that it plans to sell in the first 12 months after the spin-off. Assuming all of this happens as planned, what type of debt profile will Windstream carry? Since one of the points of this spin-off is to make Windstream's balance sheet more attractive, this is a critical question to answer. Where Verizon and Frontier are concerned, their debt-to-equity ratios are 12.4 and 2.6 respectively. The scary part for Windstream investors is, even if all goes well, Windstream's debt-to-equity would still exceed 10 . Verizon's debt-to-equity ratio is higher than Windstream's future ratio. However, Verizon is only in this position because it repurchased the part of Verizon Wireless it didn't already own. It seems clear that Windstream investors are facing a lot of uncertainty. Even if everything goes well, the company will still carry a heavy load in trying to become more competitive. If investors are able to ignore the issues facing Windstream when it comes to the company's interest expense and high debt-to-equity, it's difficult to ignore the company's core business struggles as well. It seems as though Frontier and Windstream are running their businesses with the same playbook, but Frontier is doing better than its rival at every turn. Both companies posted flat consumer and business revenue growth in the last quarter. The difference is, Frontier's consumer connections dropped by 2.4% excluding its CT acquisition, whereas Windream witnessed a drop of 5%. On the business front, Frontier lost 5.5% of its connections, whereas Windstream saw a drop of 9%. Beyond these overall connections, Frontier bested its rival in high-speed Internet, video, and voice lines. When we combine Frontier's stronger interest expense position, much lower debt-to-equity, and better core operations, it's difficult to find a reason to choose Windstream. The bottom line is, investors need to realize that Windstream's idea to split into two companies won't cure the ills facing the company. Instead investors will be faced with the difficult choice of owning two challenging companies or just one.
