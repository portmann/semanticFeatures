Guess Who Owns $1.1 Billion In Apple Stock | Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site!

The Swiss National Bank had a rough quarter in Q1 as the decision to abandon the increasingly unsustainable EURCHF floor (an event which marked an implicit admission that central banks are not all-powerful after all) blew a $32 billion hole in the central bankâ€™s euro reserves. That, however, wasnâ€™t the most remarkable takeaway from the SNBâ€™s quarterly report.  More interesting than the massive loss was the line item in the SNBâ€™s balance sheet which shows that 18% of the bankâ€™s assets are held in foreign stocks. As we noted last week , that amounts to around $100 billion â€” 15% of Switzerlandâ€™s GDP â€” in equities. This prompted us to praise the bank for its sheer brazenness in owning up to its equity holdings in a world where all plunge-protection-providing central banks are buying stocks but in which no one dares to admit it.  Just what does the SNB hold in its $100 billion stock portfolio? Quite a lot, and more than one-third of its holdings are in US equities. More specifically, the bank owns some $37 billion worth of shares in 2,548 US-listed companies, up an impressive 40% Q/Q. Here are the top 20 holdings: And here's a look at the Q/Q change (basically, they added to everything): As you can see from the above, Apple is far and away the largest US position and indeed, the SNB bought some 3.4 million shares of the iPhone maker during the first three months of the year alone, while the value of the bank's stake nearly doubled. We would be remiss if we failed to point out the hilarious irony inherent in the fact that the SNB, whose abandonment of the EURCHF floor has hit Swiss watchmakers by reducing export comeptitiveness, spent the last three months accumulating a massive stake in the maker of the Apple Watch, a product that many traditional Swiss manufacturers have derided as a fad that's unlikely to withstand the test of err.. time.  As for the SNB being one of the biggest buyers of AAPL, here is how one can explain it: SNB buys AAPL stock and lowers interest rates to force yield-starved bond investors to give money to Apple, which uses the debt proceeds to buyback AAPL stock, which boosts the value of SNB's AAPL stock.

When the market crashes, there's going to be a lot of pain felt around the world. Not just individual investors but countries as well. Thu, 05/07/2015 - 12:09 | 6069401 Cognitive Dissonance Unimaginable pain I would say. Considering how interconnected all the various parts of the system are, domino theory doesn't come close to describing the net effect. Ultimately the CB's work on the premise they can remove key dominoes from the various lines and halt the crash progression. That may have been an effective strategy decades before.......but no longer. Thu, 05/07/2015 - 12:28 | 6069467 prefan4200 Yes, we all know the US Stock market is over-priced.  But if the TPTB can use spoofing, futures manipulation, and other shenanigans to keep stock prices rising as well as prevent it from crashing, as they have been doing, what will be the catalyst to send it crashing?  Bad fundamentals?  Nope, doesn't matter.  Low volume?  Nope, that doesn't appear to be doing the trick either, in fact, that likely aids the spoofing shit.  So why can't they do this forever, short of a nuclear bomb hitting Wall Street?  What is going to stop the money-printers from jacking this market up til we are all long dead and gone?????  Really. Somebody tell me.  I wanna know. Thu, 05/07/2015 - 12:35 | 6069471 Oh regional Indian CD, you were right up above. That thumb on chin job's photo is a tell.

Equipment is on a UPS. Pow, power hit, lights just flickered, but had to boot UPS. The YouToob icon disappeared. As I began to dig, folks o/l were screaming AAPL. So I checked a streaming DVD player, poof gone from there too. It appears this was a GOOG thang. It's no coincidence it coincided with the power hit. These bastids have more control over us than we are aware of. Youtoob app available on AAPL TV3 & newer streaming players. Boosting sales through inventory they can't get rid of.

Liquid assets doesn't mean good assets and if they had to sell off a batch to cover themselves they'd get bent over, but this is how the game is played nowadays..... Thu, 05/07/2015 - 12:22 | 6069443 Urban Redneck It's not quite as bad as I feared it would be, but it could be better.   My 4 criteria from last week : Yeah there is something morally wrong with printing money out of thin air and buying up the equity capital stock of foreign nations.  But as long as it is my central bank that's doing it - my ex-banker ethics are OK with it... 1) even in a market crash where they report a huge paper loss, because the equity is backed tangible productive assets and cash flows 2) unless- they are buying equity derivatives and would only have a claim on the assets of Blackrock, Citadel, etc, 3) or unless- they were loading up and over concentrated in momo stocks like iCrap or Twatter with no real underlying assets other an intellectual property. 4) or unless- they are buying Swiss stocks which artficially inflates the value of local companies, and invites unwantedforeign fiat inflows into the local economy.

Thu, 05/07/2015 - 12:03 | 6069377 Cannon Fodder Honest question, what happens when stocks go down? Does the SNB sell? Or are the forced to hold their positions? Seems like a politcal decision could send stock markets collapsing real quick. Or there is an incentive to keep printing money and "doubling down" on positions.
