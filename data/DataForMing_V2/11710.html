Apple Watch Has Implications For Big Data, IoT And Web 3.0 - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple Watch blew out expectations at the keynote event. Quite frankly, the product has many more use cases than what I, and other tech experts had actually anticipated. I anticipate that Apple will move through the product adoption curve more quickly, and future iterations will build-upon Web 3.0, indicating significant growth potential going forward. Therefore, I reiterate my high-conviction buy recommendation, as I anticipate a respectable growth rate for sales and earnings over the long-term. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) remains one of my highest conviction long ideas following the Keynote in March, and quite frankly, I don't think any other company could have executed better when it came to both wearable devices and Ultrabooks. It was more of a show and tell exercise, as to what has been in the works for the past several years in Cupertino. As it currently stands, Apple Watch will determine the future trajectory of technology, and whether the web can be more contextualized, so that the information presented is relevant to the user based on their "interests," and "preferences." Anyone with an economics background can easily admit that increase in productivity is one of the most desirable ways to grow GDP as it's reflected in a surplus of supply with lower marginal cost, thus lowering aggregate cost, freeing up capital to chase after other goods or services, or perhaps make investments. When I look at the Apple Watch, I think of it as the consumer electronics product that will open the web, so more semantic applications can co-exist with many of the more basic HTML websites that are information based. Going forward, website will be converted into applications, and following that, we will see actively running applications that can provide real-time analytics based on the environment in which the user has been transported to, along with personal preference, which will improve security, usability, and practicality across a universe of services from B2B, B2C, and B2B2C for Apple Watch. Healthcare will be disrupted by the Apple Watch. I anticipate that preventive care, real time analytics on a patient's health, and the ability to model real world data in real time could lead to quicker diagnosis, and quicker drug development cycles. Obviously, both the medical and scientific community are eagerly awaiting the launch of the Apple Watch, as it's their gateway ticket into "big data" for healthcare and biosciences. The internet of things requires a controlling agent, and while many point out this "agent" will be the smartphone, I think there's enough evidence to suggest that a smart watch could be more effective at manipulating the environment, which may mean manipulation of other web-connected devices. Admittedly these web connected devices will require basic MCUs with some connectivity features built-into them (like Wi-Fi), which is one of the most popular connectivity standards outside of 4G LTE. However, carrier resources are limited, which is why network infrastructure has to be shared between both wireless and wireline. Unfortunately, there aren't that many smart devices out on the market. So, it will be a while before you can run your washer machine from your watch, while also having the capability to adjust the thermostat and lighting in your house. The Apple Watch tends to interact best with its own device ecosystem, so it will be a while before you can turn on and off your TV via an Apple Watch, as many of you are probably using a Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ), Vizio, Sony, LG TV. Integration will be a key component, and quite frankly, Samsung has integrated various technologies into appliances and its consumer electronics already, and it's not clear if Samsung will create an open standard for everyone to collectively piggy back off of. At least in the initial stages, application developers will work extensively to develop interactions and integration into various pooled data bases and applications in which a more ubiquitous experience will likely occur, despite OS ecosystem. This could drive significant upside to the overall utility of the device, assuming the devices can progress quickly through the adoption curve, while future iterations come with additional MEMs, so contextual information can be made readily available, and offloaded onto cloud applications that aggregate that information into both public and private databases. Assuming these initiatives prove successful, the Apple Watch will become the "new" device category to chase after with investment dollars, and various would-be competitors will likely imitate or at least attempt to integrate with Apple software, putting Apple at an overwhelming competitive advantage when compared to other device ecosystems. This has me extremely excited, as it reinforces my optimism on software and services that are tied to wearable devices, along with the device makers themselves. There are various ways for investors to participate, but of them all, Apple sounds like the safest bet, as the company has diversified its revenue stream across various "screens" and has various means to monetize software via licensing/royalty agreements via the Apple Application Store. Ipsos surveyed 2,469 Americans aged 18 and older online between March 9 and March 17 and found that 24 percent expressed an interest in purchasing the Apple Watch, including 10 percent of those describing themselves as "very interested." The data was weighted to reflect the U.S. population and has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of plus or minus 2.2 percentage points. Among the iPhone owners, 39 percent were interested in purchasing the Apple watch, including 17 percent describing themselves as very interested. There were 788 iPhone owners in the survey with a credibility interval of plus or minus 4 percentage points. As indicated by the survey, there was 24% interest in purchasing the product after the keynote. Now remember, Apple's installed base globally is around 350 million to 400 million, based on the sales data of the two-year trailing period. Therefore, it's not impossible to imagine that 10% to 20% of that installed base could equate into 35 million to 80 million device shipments in the rolling twelve-month period following the launch. This could considerably alter growth assertions made by both buy-side and sell-side analysts. Admittedly, Apple will have a hard time anticipating price elasticity of demand, as initial sales data will have to be relied upon to convey information to the supply chain, as to make adjustments to production on either low- or high-tier models of the Apple Watch. For buy-side and sell-side analysts, this spells significant complications when modeling top-line and bottom-line expansion in FY 2015. Many have skipped over the Apple Watch entirely, while others have offered extremely conservative estimates on sales and earnings. Also, investors have to be reminded that Apple may show up unprepared on launch day as demand could outweigh supply in the immediate term. This could spell out device sales being recognized further down the road, implying limited upside for FY 2015, with rosier prospects for FY 2016. Also, there are other things going on in tech, that indicates that we're in the early stages of a massive technology refresh cycle, where pent-up demand drives significant growth in both top-line and bottom-line for both old and new tech companies. It's not clear to the extent in which consumers are saving up for big purchases, but upon doing extensive research, 2015 and 2016 are going to be big years for technology companies as major technology developments across all the major ecosystems are set to launch in the foreseeable twelve-month period. Going forward, I anticipate the Apple Watch to make a bigger dent than what I had originally anticipated in prior posts on Seeking Alpha. However, I don't have enough conclusive evidence to indicate what earnings are likely to be, because there are various moving factors like currency, demand for pre-existing products, shifts in consumer behavior to new products (MacBook and Apple Watch), and uncertainty in the competitive environment. Samsung has figured out a way to compete on a slightly closer level, and the emergence of Windows 10 as a universal app ecosystem puts pressure on the Mac business. Despite all the noise, I believe Apple will retain its durable advantage, and will likely sustain a respectable growth rate over both the short- and long-term.
