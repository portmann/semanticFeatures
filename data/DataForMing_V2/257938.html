5 Stocks That Beat Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway | Seeking Alpha The annual compound return of Berkshire is 21% over a 50-year period and 28.2% in its first thirty years, known as its ‘growth phase’. If you bought Berkshire shares back in 1965 and held them to this day, the absolute return equates to 1,379,476%, compared to 2,607% from the S&P 500. However, ordinary retail investors can beat Berkshire returns by picking the next growth stock like a Starbucks, Microsoft or Franklin Resources. But there are obstacles to choosing the right business to get ‘Buffett-like’ returns. To beat these obstacles you need to learn what makes a business successful by picking up ‘winning’ characteristics trait from a Microsoft or a Starbucks. You can beat Warren Buffett at his own game, and I'm not talking about outperforming his stock selection over a two or five year period! It may sound a bit optimistic because even professional fund managers with many years of experience can't 'hang' with the Oracle. So, what chances do the ordinary retail investors have against beating the 'richest investor in the world'? Looking back at Buffett's record and measuring it against other publicly-listed companies there is a handful of businesses that have withstood the test of time. But over a period of at least fifteen years or more, you can hand pick these stocks and use the 'buy and hold' strategy. However, we should not belittle Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A ) achievements because a $1,000 invested in Berkshire back in 1964 would grow your pension pot to $11.6m 50 years later, a total return of over 1 million percent! Despite having a world-beating track record for over 50 years, ordinary retail investors in the past still have a chance of beating the 'Oracle' at his own game by buying these companies. P.S. The periods covered are either from its inception or represent the latest stock price information. All stocks are adjusted for dividends, stock splits, and stock consolidation. This American consumer electronics corporation listed on the market back in April 26, 1985 , has beaten Berkshire Hathaway stock by a margin of 7,000%! If you bought Best Buy (NYSE: BBY ) stock in 1985, the average stock price paid would be 18 cents/share (adjusted, though the unadjusted price is $18/share). Back then its IPO was to fund new stores openings . This has paid off as it achieved several financial milestones by surpassing the $1 billion mark in revenue in 1993 and reaching $10bn in revenue before the turn of the century. A. It became the first electronic retailer to make the switch from selling analog devices to selling digital products only. B. And the real success, according to Forbes is ' knowledgeable, available sales staff .' By being the first to change and focus on customer needs Best Buy is the number one consumer electronics retailer in the U.S., as shown below: However, Best Buy has made several acquisitions, including Napster in 2008 for $121m in cash (by 2011 it sold to Rhapsody for a small stake in the whole company). Now, Best Buy has 39m unique monthly visitors in the U.S. on its website (not bad for a company once known as ' Sound of Music .') The meteoric rise of Charles Schwab (NYSE: SCHW ) has been phenomenal. Founded in 1973, Charles Schwab is a U.S. brokerage firm focusing on wealth managements, trading, investing and banking. It was acquired by Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ) in 1983. Four years later, management bought back the business for $280m or five times more what BofA paid for and made its debut in the stock market in the same year. A $10,000 investment on Charles Schwab in 1989 at an average adjusted stock price of 18 cents/share would have made you a millionaire of $1.438m (before taxes). That unique business model is its wealth management business. The firm has $7.6bn under management back in 1985. They surpass the '$100bn' mark by 1994, and now manage $2.5 trillion of client assets. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) needs no introduction, we all know what it does, and we all know who Bill Gates is. Putting your $10k would have grown your capital to $6.42m today, compared to $730,800 in Berkshire; this return is nearly nine times greater! The tech firm was founded in 1975 has since produced and hold 10,000 patients. Microsoft used to have a 90% market share in operating systems worldwide before Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) made in-roads with mobile devices like the iPad (Apple has its operating system). Ever since, Buffett dipped his toe in the technology sector (a sector he refuses to invest) by taking a 5.5% stake of IBM (NYSE: IBM ) at a purchase price of $10.7bn (during 2011). However, Warren should have invested in Bill Gates' Microsoft (who is a close friend and fellow board member at Berkshire) and would have seen gains of 100% plus . In its first year of operations, it made revenue of $16,000 . Microsoft also has over 5,000 pieces of art collection to its name. If you bought 1,000 Microsoft shares at inception, you would be holding 288,000 of its shares today, due to the stock splitting nine times! The most famous coffee shop in the world and was originally founded by two teachers and a writer. Here's the outperformance against Berkshire: Although the stock has returned 16,754% since 1992, you could have taken advantage of this well-known coffee maker back in late 2008 when its stock price collapsed by 80% to less than $4/share. Now it's worth over 60 bucks, or 15 times your original capital since 2008 (excluding dividends and to stock splits)! The success of Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX ) is its focus on people . Enter a Starbuck store you get a sense it is a place for everyone [a bit like McDonald's (NYSE: MCD )], which is why they serve over 70m customers each week in over 65 different countries. Secondly, is its ambiance, the stores almost look like your 'living room' where you can go about drinking your coffee and chatting to your mates. Lastly, the company became the convenient of choice as it becomes accessible within walking distance (Hence, why the company added on average two new stores on a daily basis since 1987 .). Franklin Resources (NYSE: BEN ) is not a mining company but acts as a holding company for its subsidiaries namely Franklin Templeton Investments. This financial services business focuses on being a mutual fund and retirement planning services. Looking at its stock returns the company made 137,766% in capital gains compared to Berkshire's 15,941% over the same period. Founded in 1947 as Franklin Distributors, the company came to prominences in the 1980s when it manages to double total assets under management starting in 1980 for six years in a row. In 1992, it acquired the Templeton, Galbraith & Hansberger Ltd (founded by Sir John Templeton). But the success of the business is by investing worldwide, in particularly Asia, where growth is the fastest. There you have it, five businesses that beaten Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway to the punch bowl, or is it? What set these companies apart from their competition? There are several traits found in these companies that led them to worldwide success, these are: 1. Being in the right industry; - The rise of Microsoft coincide with the rise of the personal computer in the 80s. Just like the automobile was going to replace the horse, the personal computer was destined to replace the outdated typewriter. 2. Being a distributor of innovation; - Why risk your money on R&D to create the next big 'thing', when you could be a distributor. Best Buy, the largest electronics retailer in the U.S. by distributing electronics that sells. It differentiate itself by having knowledge staff and great customer service. 3. Be the center point for social gatherings; - that was the mission of Starbucks. By designing your cafe like a person's living room and accepting everyone, you're likely to be a success. 4. Taking advantage of economic policy changes; - the deregulation of financial services was the big economic story in the 1980s, also made famous in popular culture by the movie Wall Street. Charles Schwab took advantage of these changes by recognizing this huge growth momentum. 5. The rise of the emerging economies; - a country with a per capita of $1,000 per annum is likely to grow faster than a country with $30,000 per annum. So it is common sense to invest in emerging economies and capture some of this fast growth. That is what Franklin Templeton Investments have done, and the returns from its stock price speak for itself. All these companies had greater returns because they were smaller than Berkshire was. So a smaller business with a recipe for success would grow much faster in its initial stage of development. When Buffett took over Berkshire Hathaway between 1962 and 1965, the stock was purchased at an average price of $14.86/share and over a period of 50 years it rose to $205,005/share, which worked out to be 1,379,476% return. Investing in the S&P 500 index would return 2,607% in that same period. The best way of measuring returns from Berkshire and comparing it to Microsoft or a Starbucks is to use compound returns. Here the table: On that basis, the comparison is more fairly accurate. However, some of these businesses could still be classified as a 'growth' company, whereas Berkshire is maturing (meaning slower growth). If we measure Berkshire stock returns in the period from 1965-1995 (where they're in the growth phase), the compound annual return comes to 28.2%. But does that mean the five stocks beating Berkshire is void due to unfair comparisons and useless for the retail investors? Being an investor is about discovering the next great story. For example, Berkshire was growing at its fastest between 1965 and 1985 it would be wise to dump the stock and reinvest the profits into Microsoft or Franklin Resources Inc. That would put your portfolio always in the 'growth phase'. On the next section, I will explain why it is hard to choose winning businesses. Picking stocks like a Starbucks or Microsoft can be a fluke On hindsight, it is easy to pretend Starbucks and Microsoft are winners today. But back in the early days, how many investors were backing these businesses to succeed and sustain its success over a period? This is why picking a 'Microsoft' stock in its early inception period is a 'fluke' for the ordinary retail investor (unless you know Bill Gates and his close associates). Here are some obvious obstacles to picking 'long-term' winners: 1. The level of competition; - picking the right company from the competition is like finding a needle in the haystack. 2. The business cycle; - some sectors are more cylindrical than others. The mining sector being obvious, this makes long-term success almost impossible to maintain. 3. There are other winners; - the glory isn't dominated by one person or entity, sometimes there are tens or hundreds of successful businesses from the same industry. The problem is picking the ones that will earn you the higher return for your buck. 4. Sustainable business or a fad; - knowing which businesses would still be around for twenty to thirty years' time can be tricky. So, we should be focusing on businesses with long-term solutions not 'quick' fixes! 5. Companies' business model or products swallow up by rivals/new entrants; - sometimes we see a business doing well until a rival or new player stole their business. When Apple launched the iPhone, it revolutionizes the mobile phone industry. Names like Nokia (NYSE: NOK ), Motorola (NYSE: MSI ), SonyEricisson, and Blackberry (NASDAQ: BBRY ), struggled to compete with Apple entering its market. In the next section, I will talk about the strategies for picking winners even when they are newcomers. Here is how retail investors can pick winning companies like Buffett Despite the odds being against you, there are certain company characteristics you could identify that could make them a success. The best way to approach this is to read about successful companies in the past and identifying these characteristics which makes them the best in the business. For example, you want to invest in the fast food business, read about the success companies like McDonald's and the KFCs of this world. Below is a 'mini story' of how Starbucks made its breakthrough to become a multinational coffee chain. According to Business Insider , Starbucks has these characteristics that stand out from the competition: 1. Staff are fully trained and certified to serve coffee; - each employee goes through 30 hours of training from knowing how to make different types of coffee to learning the 'short-hand' initials needed to make 87,000 different drinks combination. 2. Installing the best coffee machine to serve the best coffee; 3. Never serving old coffee; - the company has a strict policy on not serving coffee that is passed 30 minutes. Also, there is a timed regime for iced coffee/tea and pastries to keep everything fresh; 4. Having free Wi-Fi and unlimited laptop use, along with being the first to adopt new payment system; 5. Serving customers in 3 minutes; - by ticking all the attributes in attracting customers to your store you need a system to process sales fast enough and Starbucks can churn out 200 customers/hour. The takeaway here is there are new businesses being created that will earn you 'extraordinary' returns on your investment. To do this, you would need to understand certain trait that will separate it from the entire competition.
