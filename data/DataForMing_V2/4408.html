Disney: What The Star Wars And Frozen 2 Announcements Mean For Shareholders - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Consumer Products provides high margins and is expanding with strength of Marvel and Frozen. Hasbro ready to ride Disney's coattails with rights to Frozen in 2016 and Marvel and Star Wars through 2020. Shares of Disney (NYSE: DIS ) hit record highs on Thursday, as investors responded to several announcements made by the media company. Most of the items presented weren't huge secrets or even new, but rather confirmations and release dates. This was enough to get investors excited and for great reason as the future continues to play into Disney's hands with blockbusters contributing to several operating segments. After listening to the presentation from Thursday and reading through supporting materials, I wanted to share some quick opinions and also show how Hasbro (NASDAQ: HAS ) will benefit along the way. Perhaps the biggest news from Thursday was the fact that Disney is officially working on a sequel to the $1.3 billion grossing sing-along phenomenon "Frozen". This doesn't come as a huge surprise to me, as I have predicted several times that a sequel was going to happen. Of course this announcement comes at the perfect time, as this weekend's release of "Cinderella" will feature the exclusive "Frozen Fever" short film to moviegoers prior to the featured movie. As I predicted before, I think this could lead to "Cinderella" seeing strong revenue as until the animated short is released elsewhere or leaked online, this will be the only way fans of "Frozen" can see the movie. Now that the sequel has been officially announced and fans are getting a look at "Frozen Fever", the next question on everyone's mind will be concerning the release date. I've been pretty open in my belief that the movie will be released November 21, 2018 based on blocked off dates and an already pretty full lineup. I stand behind this guess, although part of me thinks it would make sense to release it earlier. I think the official announcement will come at this year's D23 Expo, to be held in August. Shares could see a nice pop on this announcement as well. Since Disney's acquisition of the Marvel comic book brand, Disney has worked aggressively at releasing movies each year and expanding the licensing power of these well-known characters. Toy sales for Marvel related merchandise were up 13% last year. This IGN article says Disney is trying to appeal to audiences by licenses of the individual members of The Avengers and not just as one collective, essentially breaking the superhero team back up. That article also sites expanding Avengers characters into newly licensed areas like food (Chobani, granola bars) and action sports (Spider-Man). Women's fashion was also one area mentioned for expansion of the expansion of the Avengers brand. Spider-Man will likely see a stronger push now that Disney can also use him in upcoming movies. One area that might not be getting enough attention is the Guardians of the Galaxy brand. This movie was a huge success and is now bringing a sequel movie and an animated television show, which will premiere on the company's own Disney XD later in 2015. With the strength of the brand and the expansion into television, Disney has already extended current Guardians licenses and has also signed new ones. Along with Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy providing a boost, Disney is already planning ahead for its shows set to debut on Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) this year. Disney has created individual merchandising programs for the upcoming Netflix shows "Jessica Jones", "Luke Cage" and "Daredevil". Along with the "Frozen 2" confirmation, the next biggest news was concerning the Star Wars franchise, which is one of the newest pieces to the Disney puzzle. The company announced that the spin-off movie will be titled "Rogue One". This movie has a release date of December 16, 2016 and will be in the years between "Star Wars VII" and "Star Wars VIII". Disney is already getting aggressive with the brand by releasing a Star Wars related movie every year beginning in 2015. This strategy has worked with Marvel and by Disney utilizing the large base of characters in the Star Wars universe, it should have similar success with origin stories and spin-offs. As I have said several times, the upcoming Star Wars movies are going to be blockbusters in my opinion and similar to Frozen, carry into every segment for the company. That means theme park attractions, cruise ships, video games, movies, television, and video games. The addition of the Star Wars movie in 2016 adds to an exciting lineup of movies set to release over the next several years. Also, it makes for a rather interesting fiscal 2016 as two Star Wars movies will be released in the same fiscal year, something investors should definitely be excited about. While most movie analysts focus on the box office basis on a calendar year, I think it's important to lay out the fiscal year splits for Disney here. I called "Captain America: Civil War" a new Avengers style movie with the inclusion of Iron Man and rumored Spider-Man's first appearance in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I believe this could lead to Avengers style box office. So then pair that box office with a new Star Wars movie and several other sure blockbusters and you have an incredibly strong fiscal 2016. Now take a look at fiscal 2017 and you have two Star Wars movies, two Marvel movies, "Toy Story 4" and the continued expansion of the "Pirates of the Caribbean" franchise. My earlier predictions called for the following: · "Toy Story 4": $450 million domestic, $1.2 billion international · "Star Wars VIII": $520 million domestic, $1.6 billion international Add those three up and you have worldwide box office of $5 billion for the contributing fiscal 2017 year from just three movies. Then factor in the rest of the movies and you can see how that year could be extremely special for Disney and its shareholders. The presentation on Thursday confirmed the strength of Disney's brands as consumer products. In the last year, Disney had 11 separate brands that saw global retail sales of $1 billion or more. The strength and focus on consumer products should be a big deal to investors. The most recent first quarter shows exactly how important consumer products are to the bottom line for Disney, especially given shares now triple digit price and creeping up price to earnings multiple. Here is a look at first quarter earnings: As you can see from the chart, consumer products was the fourth highest revenue contributor for the first quarter. But, a quick look at the third and fourth columns paints a strong picture for this segment that should have investors excited. The consumer segment was the third highest contributor to profits and posted the highest operating margin. While other toy stocks like Mattel and Leapfrog have fallen, shares of Hasbro have fared better, gaining 12% in 2015 to date. A big reason for Hasbro's success is the strength of Disney's consumer brands. The company has the rights to several product lines under the Marvel and Star Wars banners. To make matters more exciting, Hasbro also acquired the rights to make dolls based on the Frozen and Disney Princess brands, a move which saw Hasbro take the rights from rival Mattel. At the time of this announcement, I said I thought the deal between Hasbro and Disney confirmed a sequel to Frozen was happening. Hasbro now has the rights to Frozen beginning in 2016 and the rights to Star Wars and Marvel through the year 2020, which would as of now cover the new Star Wars trilogy. While Hasbro is a big winner by having these rights in place, Disney has already won in terms of guaranteed royalties. The deals for Star Wars and Marvel will bring in $225 million and $80 million respectively in guaranteed money for Disney, further boosting the consumer products line. Shares of Hasbro are up 12% in 2015 and continue to trade close to 52 week highs. Shares also sport a 3% dividend yield, which should not be underestimated as a reason to go long now for the long term benefits. Analysts see revenue growing 9.1% in fiscal 2016 to $4.7 billion. This figure could come in conservative depending on the initial lineup of Frozen products and the official release date. The strength of Marvel, Star Wars, and Frozen should power shares of Hasbro higher in 2015 and I think shares could end the year closing in on $70. So with Disney shares up an already impressive 13.8% and sitting at record highs, what's the play here? I have recommended buying shares of Disney for years and often cite wait for pullbacks and buy shares. This isn't exactly a company that has seen large pullbacks that create good entry points. I think the days of not being in the triple digits could be over, unless the company decides to split its shares, which I anticipated earlier at the triple digit mark. I threw out a 20+ earnings multiple on Disney before to justify a $100 share price. I think in the end, valuation is hard to gauge on Disney as the media company will continue to shift into an event driven catalyst play. Yahoo Finance currently lists revenue targets of $52.3 billion and $55.8 billion respectively for the current and next fiscal year. Those figures factor in growth of around 7% each year. While this is a great number for a $100 billion plus company, I still think it could be conservative given the strength Disney has been showing across the board in all business segments. While this article really focuses on studio and consumer products, other segments like television, theme parks (China open in 2016), and interactive (first profit last fiscal year) could also serve as ways to report higher than expected revenue. With that being said, Disney is a name investors need to be in going forward. I don't think there is going to be a valuation correction anytime soon and think releases of movies like "Frozen 2", "Star Wars VII" and "Avengers: Age of Ultron" will continue to provide rapid boosts to the share price. Each quarterly report should also provide a nice boost, unless the company stumbles on guidance, which I don't see as a strong likelihood. Remember there is still several events that can drive shares higher in the short and long term. For starters, the box office results of blockbusters like "Avengers: Age of Ultron" and "Star Wars VII" act as catalysts. A later announcement of the actual release date of "Frozen 2" also serves as a catalyst as it will determine which fiscal year the movie falls in and how it could shape up future earnings.
