With Comcast-TWC done, federal suit likely focuses on AT&T-DirecTV - CBS Corporation (NYSE:CBS) | Seeking Alpha To screen ETFs by asset class, performance, yield and more, check out the ETF Hub. ETF Hub Apr 24 2015, 19:30 ET | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Comcast has ended its pursuit of Time Warner Cable, but what about that lawsuit from content companies that threatened to slow the whole thing down? Companies including CBS , Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS ) and Viacom ( VIA , VIAB ) argued that the FCC's sharing hundreds of thousands of pages of negotiating strategies with third-party merger opponents like Dish Network (NASDAQ: DISH ) would be "highly damaging." The fight was likely to add several weeks to any related merger consideration. The suit, still at the U.S. Court of Appeals, is still in progress because it also involved the ongoing AT&T (NYSE: T ) deal to acquire DirecTV (NASDAQ: DTV ). Attorneys close to the case are figuring that the Comcast-TWC documents will now be off the table as a moot point. Still, the decision likely still has an impact on the timeline for AT&T/DirecTV. The FCC will file an updated notification with the court.
