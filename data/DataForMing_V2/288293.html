Bloomberg: Streaming deal expirations could prompt CW to go over-the-top - CBS Corporation (NYSE:CBS) | Seeking Alpha To screen ETFs by asset class, performance, yield and more, check out the ETF Hub. ETF Hub Jan 12 2016, 20:05 ET | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor With its deal with Netflix ( NFLX +1.4%) expiring (alongside expirations with Hulu and station owner Tribune Media ( TRCO +1.3%)), the CW Network ( CBS +0.5%, TWX +2.1%) is even considering creating its own over-the-top streaming service, Bloomberg reports. Going over-the-top is all the rage among ratings-challenged media networks now, and the CW's two co-owners are no strangers: CBS All Access launched in late 2014 offering live and on-demand shows, and Time Warner's HBO Now launched straight to viewers in time for last spring's Game of Thrones premiere. The lineup of the expirations may make timing right for the CW, which is suffering about 13% lower prime-time ratings this year. Similar to the CBS service, the CW could offer a live feed along with a library of on-demand content. Sources said such a direct-to-consumer play is inevitable for the network and prices discussed are around $2-$4/month. Netflix currently has past seasons of CW programs while Hulu ( CMCSA +0.3%, FOX +1.8%, FOXA +2.1%, DIS +1.5%) offers current seasons.
