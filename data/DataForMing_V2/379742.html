Dreamy talk from Motor Trend on the Apple Car - Bayerische Motoren Werke AG ADR (OTCMKTS:BAMXY) | Seeking Alpha Apr 14 2016, 08:26 ET | By: Clark Schultz , SA News Editor Motor Trend issues an exhaustive look at what an Apple Car might look like and feature in a freshly-posted story. The focus is on guesswork, not concrete details from Cupertino. A panel of experts concludes that the BMW ( OTCPK:BAMXY ) i3 isn't there yet and Tesla Motors (NASDAQ: TSLA ) is "kinda there" in terms of creating the electric vehicle that is the true game changer. Their vision of the Apple Car sounds pretty much like what major automakers such as Ford (NYSE: F ) and General Motors (NYSE: GM ) are already talking about with the focus on mobility, simplicity, autonomous features, and connected options, Even if Apple's Project Titan is ultimately canceled, the Motor Trend panel still thinks some Apple features such as augmented reality windshields could survive. If AAPL does intend to compete here on its own, TSLA is kaput. The SHORT of a lifetime! AAPL liquidity and unlimited resources would destroy any vision that Elon Musk has in his head... ... unless the two companies decide to cooperate instead of compete with each other?... In such case, TSLA is going to 300 overnight.... You just described the Tesla cars.  Ford and Chevy are not leading the way they are following Trsla by all standards. Motor Trends' idea look ridiculous. Why do EV engineers always think in terms of space ships? That is exactly why Tesla is so successful, because they stay away from ridiculous.
