Disney: Caution Flag - Novel Challenges Ahead - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha A standard Disney narrative focuses on a wildly successful company with two issues: CEO succession and ESPN. These two issues have been reviewed ad nauseam, so this article will venture no further with these than pointing to interesting SA articles addressing them. Disney’s Studio Entertainment and Parks and Resorts have been its bright stars and look to continue as such. Disney's Parks and Resorts segment is on the cusp of opening its long anticipated Shanghai Disney Resort. Disney (NYSE: DIS ) is a much beloved company. It has stamped a strong input of affection and joyous memories on Americans of every age. The introductory narrative above finds support in many publications, but most authoritatively on Seeking Alpha. The ESPN issues are addressed with particular ferocity by Max Greve in his article titled "Bob Iger Just Told Us Why Disney Is A Bad Investment ". The SA Community discusses every aspect of this thesis in the 94 comments that follow Mr. Greve's article. The succession issue has been less in the news in the last few weeks, however one of my favorite SA articles on Disney, "Disney Is In Good Hands " by Nicholas Mushaike explores this issue at great length. It concludes, as I believe the case to be, that Disney's succession issues are overrated. An article I wrote at the end of March, gives an overview of the entire company with particular emphasis on the Studio Entertainment piece. It supports the general narrative that Disney's operations, aside from ESPN, are hitting on all cylinders. The opening premise for this article is that Disney's major concerns are twofold. The first is its CEO succession question caused by highly respected CEO and Chairman Bob Iger's decision to leave the company at the end of next year. This concern was heightened recently when Chief Operating Officer Tom Staggs, whom many felt was the heir apparent, announced in April of this year that he was leaving the company in May. The second relates to Disney's ESPN cash cow that is beginning to run a little dry. ESPN is losing its ability to command premium revenue growth as has been its historic pattern for the last several years. A quick overview of Disney revenue sources at the close of 2015 helps to show the relative significance of Disney's various pieces. Below I set out the contributors to 2015 Revenues shown in Table 1 from the article I wrote earlier this year . The last and least segment I reported, Interactive, was recently axed and is no longer an issue. Obviously, investors are wise to keep their eyes on candidates for Iger's successor. All of Disney's segments rely on inspired management to achieve success. The ESPN issues relate peculiarly to Media Networks. However, insofar as Media Networks is the Big Kahuna for Disney's revenues, stresses in ESPN are also significant to the overall health of the company. If Media Networks was a reliable growth driver, it would alleviate the importance to the overall company of earnings misses at other sections. 1) Media Networks … no prognosis per introductory remarks. 2) Studio Entertainment…the star will remain the star. Disney branded films created some buzz when they became the earliest ever to assemble combined domestic box office revenues of $1 billion. Four more are on the way this fiscal year. "Alice Through the Looking Glass" will be in theaters by the time you read this article. Disney will close out the year with: "… Pixar's Finding Dory; Steven Spielberg's The BFG; [and] a live-action remake of Pete's Dragon " 3) Consumer Products… a muddy picture from this smaller segment looks to stay so over any short term period. Q2, 2016's earnings report points out the difficulties of modeling this one on any periodic basis. I see it as a key piece of the Disney ecosystem that will always be as solid as the Disney brand, which means rock solid, very much as set out in my earlier article. This is Disney's second largest revenue producer. It is the basis for this article. It operates an incredible spectrum of parks, resorts and cruise ships around the world. These include: "Florida. Walt Disney World Resort. Disney Cruise Line. Disney Vacation Club. Adventures by Disney. Japan. Tokyo Disney Resort. France. Disneyland Paris. Hong Kong. Hong Kong Disneyland.China. Shanghai Disney Resort. California. Disneyland Resort. Walt Disney Imagineering. Hawaii. Aulani - A Disney Resort & Spa." Disney Chairman Bob Iger has boundless enthusiasm for Shanghai Disney. For that reason alone I am confident it is going to be a glorious success over the near term. During Disney's May 10, Q2, 2016 conference call Chairman Iger could not have been more enthusiastic about Disney's newest marvel, the Shanghai Park and Resort. His enthusiasm is palpable when he stated: "It really is impossible to overstate our excitement about this spectacular resort. It represents the very best that Disney has to offer in a way that is both respectful and relevant to the people of China, or as we have been saying, it is authentically Disney and distinctly Chinese, and we can't wait to share it with the world." Such enthusiasm from the highest level of Disney management is both a compliment to Disney's Parks and Resorts Division and a command. The command is that everyone pay attention and not foul this one up. Surely all hands are on deck making certain that every aspect of the June 16 opening proceed flawlessly. I expect it to be an operational marvel. An article from 2014 quotes Iger in claiming that the deal will cost a total of $5.5 billion. Disney's Q2, 2016 10Q sets out the following as the ownership and initial costs of Shanghai Disney Resort: "The Company and Shanghai Shendi (Group) Co., Ltd (Shendi) are constructing a Disney Resort (Shanghai Disney Resort) in the Pudong district of Shanghai that initially includes a theme park, two hotels and a retail, dining and entertainment complex. The park opening is planned for June 16, 2016. The investment in Shanghai Disney Resort will be funded in accordance with each shareholder's ownership percentage, with approximately 67% from equity contributions and 33% from shareholder loans. As of April 2, 2016, the outstanding balance of loans provided by the Company and Shendi to Shanghai Disney Resort were 3.8 billion yuan ($585 million) and 5.0 billion yuan ($774 million), respectively. The Company and Shendi have committed to fund an additional 1.1 billion yuan ($164 million) and 1.4 billion yuan ($218 million) of loans, respectively. Shanghai Disney Resort is owned through two joint venture companies, in which Shendi owns 57% and the Company owns 43%. A management company, in which the Company has a 70% interest and Shendi a 30% interest, is responsible for designing, constructing and operating Shanghai Disney Resort." When I calculate the total cost of both Shendi and Disney, including both loans and funding, actual and committed, the total comes to $5.223 billion, surprisingly close to the earlier bruited $5.5 billion. The same 10Q has several additional mentions of sundry categories of expense associated with the Shanghai Park, such as: "Selling, general, administrative and other costs increased $3 million from $891 million to $894 million due to higher marketing costs and pre-opening expenses for Shanghai Disney Resort, partially offset by lower domestic marketing spending" The prior quarter's 10Q has a similar catchall. I expect next quarter's to be the same. I have made no effort to tally these all. It would likely be impossible. It surely approaches many tens of millions of dollars. Shanghai Disney has been in the works more than a decade. China's current leader Xi Jinping took over his top posts far more recently in 2013. The Wall Street Journal has observed that he is a Chinese nationalist . The Washington Post has observed that certain of his actions have a Maoist tinge . The Economist has done so also . The Economist has numerous articles pointing to Xi Jinping's efforts to cleanse China of foreign influences, including foreign names. The Economist also points to upcoming battles over China's WTO trade status. Numerous commentators have noted Xi Jinping's hostility to weird architecture. So here it is 2016. Chinese nationalism, to the level of near Maoism is rising; in comes Disney plopping a huge theme park and resort in one of China's largest cities. "The mantra for Disney executives working on the company's $5.5-billion Shanghai Disney resort has, for years, been to create something both 'authentically Disney and distinctly Chinese.' On Wednesday, as Disney Chairman and Chief Executive Bob Iger unveiled a huge scale model for the media in Shanghai, he said he believed the company had attained the 'perfect balance.' But how exactly is Disney bringing in Chinese elements? And how is the park -- opening next year -- going to be specifically geared to mainland visitors, without alienating foreign guests?" I, for one, was pretty sure that Disney could mange this without any great problem. However, a recent kerfuffle that has not received much press, gives me some pause in this regard. Somehow or another Disney has managed to infuriate one of its Chinese competitors. This individual, Wang Jianlin, recently gave rise to the following headlines in the Financial Times: Vow to 'make venture unprofitable' as Dalian Wanda prepares to open rival park" With Chinese nationalism on the rise, Disney does not need a committed enemy with vast resources to feed resentment. That is apparently the scenario that exists however. Disney Parks and Resort's Second Challenge One of the most unpleasant news lines this spring has been the numerous stories documenting the spread of the Zika virus and its various effects, most unpleasantly and notably its effect on unborn fetuses. Disney Parks and Resorts has responded to this news to date by installing a firm prohibition for its cruise lines. It prohibits pregnant women who have entered the 24th week of their pregnancy or will do so on the cruise from taking the cruise. To this point Zika has been perceived as relatively low risk in the United States because so far there is no record of mosquito born infection of any Zika sufferer in the United States. So far they have been contracted elsewhere and carried into the United States or have resulted from sexual contact with a foreign acquired Zika patient. Some observers also fret that Zika transmission may be possible via blood transfusions. In the event that a Zika transmission would take place in Florida, as opposed to being brought in from elsewhere, it might reasonably be expected to place stress on visits to Disney World. I personally believe that Disney management is using every effort to eradicate mosquitoes in Disney World. I would guess that it is one of the places in the world where one is least likely to encounter mosquitoes. However, visitors are not teleported to Disney through a wormhole. They must travel to reach the park. To the extent this trip puts people at risk of contracting the virus, some number of them will postpone the trip until the Zika situation has more clarity. When one googles "Zika Disney" it is apparent that this is a consideration on some people's minds. If a Florida based mosquito infection occurs, the issue will become more prominent. It is no longer possible to earn a decent investment grade return. Instead, it is necessary to invest in stocks to hope to gain a decent investment return. Stocks are like Disney in that they thrive on narratives. So far the principle villains in the Disney narrative have been ESPN and executive succession. These narratives have slowed the stock tending to keep it trapped ~$100 per share. This article hypothesizes new narratives with new villains. It is my hope that doing so will prepare Disney holders for these matters. I do not see either as reasons to desert the stock. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.
