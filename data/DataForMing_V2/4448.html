Intel Inside The iPhone: LTE Modem And Camera? - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel has a competent Category-10 LTE modem that can replace Qualcommâ€™s modem inside the next iPhone. Apple still dreams of a better camera for the iPhone. Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities already hinted last January that Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) will supply baseband or LTE modems to the iPhone in 2016. I do not agree with Kuo's musing that ARM-based Mac OS X computers will soon be released. However, the recent rumor that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) will use an Intel XMM 7360 LTE modem for some iPhone models (intended for emerging markets) fortifies Kuo's speculation over baseband processors. If we look at the chart below released by KGI Securities, Kuo predicts that Intel will supply baseband/wireless components to 30% of the iPhone production in 2016. Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ), which is still the sole supplier of baseband parts this year, will supply its LTE modems to 70% of the iPhone production next year. Kuo's speculation that Apple will use different wireless modems for its iPhone in 2016 is not supported by Creative Strategies' analyst, Ben Bajarin . Bajarin claims that if Apple will really switch baseband processor supplier, it will do so on a universal basis . Intel could really benefit if Apple completely drops Qualcomm in favor of the XMM 7360. An IHS teardown of iPhone models reveals that the baseband/wireless components' gives Qualcomm around $33 per iPhone. Apple sold more than 74 million iPhones during its most recent quarter. Even if Intel prices the XM 7360 at $15, the huge amount of iPhones that Apple sell per year could help Intel erase the big losses of its Mobile division. Apple sold 169 million iPhones last year and Adam Levy of Motley Fool argues that the company can sell 200 million iPhones this year. Even if Bajarin is wrong about his universal switch speculation and we use Ming-Chi Kuo's 30% estimate, Intel's future benefit from iPhone baseband processors still comes around to 900 million ($15 x 60 million units). Winning the supply rights to the iPhone's wireless section is even more lucrative than supplying the processor. The screenshot below shows that the XMM 7360, like Qualcomm's MDM9625 modem inside the iPhone 6, also supports LTE-Advanced and Carrier Aggregation . But the MDM9625 is allegedly only a category LTE modem limited to 150Mpbs download speed. The XMM 7360 is Category 10 modem that can deliver up to 450 Mbps speed on LTE-FDD/TDD networks. The iPhone Could Use The Camera From Intel Another important component which Intel could supply inside the iPhone is the camera. Looking at the chart of IHS above we can see that the cameras of the iPhone costs around $11 in the iPhone 6, and $12.50 in the iPhone 6 Plus. Winning the camera slot of the next iPhone could give Intel another $5-to-$10 revenue from every iPhone sold. Intel's revolutionary RealSense SnapShot technology might be what Apple need to make its iPhone become a real alternative to compact digital cameras. The iPhone 6 has a very powerful 64-bit A8 processor but people are still not satisfied with its old 8MP cameras. The experts says Apple has failed to keep up with the competition when it comes to resolution and picture quality of other smartphone cameras. The big 5.7-inch design of the iPhone 6 plus means the three cameras that Intel uses for its RealSense SnapShot technology could fit at the backside of future iPhones and iPads. The Lytro-like quality of Intel RealSense SnapShot camera technology can help people manipulate the focus of their pictures after they already taken the shot. The depth-sensing ability of RealSense SnapShot can help iPhone users create wonderful Bokeh effect - which professional photographers usually can only achieve using expensive lenses like the $1,550 Canon EF 50mm f/1.2 USM lens. Dell already used the RealSense SnapShot camera in the 6mm-thin Venue 8 7000 Series Android tablet. CNET claims the SnapShot camera of the Dell Venue 8 makes it an innovative photography gadget. Tom's Hardware also praises the RealSense SnapShot camera of the Dell Venue 8. However, a smartphone is still more convenient to use than an 8-inch tablet when it comes to taking photographs. Apple can use the Optical Image Stabilization found in the iPhone 6 Plus to complement Intel's RealSense SnapShot. Samsung's upcoming Galaxy S6 will feature a 16MP camera with Optical Image Stabilization but it still won't be able to match the 3D depth-sensing capability of Intel's RealSense SnapShot. Intel can worm itself inside the iPhone even if Apple continues to ignore the 14-nanometer Atom X5 . The possibility of replacing/joining Qualcomm as the iPhone's baseband processor supplier could help Intel reduce its contra-revenue expenses on mobile chips. The ripple effect of an Apple endorsement of the XMM 7360 could also inspire other smartphone vendors to drop Qualcomm for Intel. Qualcomm still dominates the LTE baseband processor market with 80% market share . However, Intel's investment in Spreadtrum Communications could decrease Qualcomm's share. Intel and Spreadtrum are already among the top five vendors of multi-mode LTE modems. Spreadrum has 3G and 4G baseband processors which are popular among Chinese manufacturers of low-cost Android phones and tablets. A two-prong attack against Qualcomm's modems for high-end and low-end smartphones is a great tactic for Intel. Furthermore, my argument that Intel's RealSense 3D camera technology could help Apple, is supported by recent actions of the iPhone company. Apple again filed a patent for a new way to improve the optical image stabilization of mobile phone cameras. Patently Apple has a list of patents that Apple filed/owns which exposes Apple's strong desire to come up with better cameras for iOS devices. It is true that Apple already filed for a patent on a 3D camera last December. However, Intel's RealSense camera is already available for immediate use. I hope that Tim Cook takes a look at a RealSense SnapShot camera. Intel's invention is a very intelligent addition to any smartphone. The RealSense SnapShot can duplicate the Bokeh effect of a $1,500 Canon lens after the photo has already been taken. INTC is a Buy . Look at the chart below, with or without Apple's approval of the XMM 7360, Intel is still a dividend aristocrat that is patently underpriced compared to its semiconductor peers. In spite of Intel's recent reduction of its Q1 2015 revenue estimate, there are still 12 analysts at TipRanks who share my Buy recommendation for INTC. First Quarter PC sales always drop significantly since 2011. If Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) can release the final version of Windows 10 before Christmas 2015, Intel Bulls could again push the stock above the $35 price barrier this year.
