Verizon: 3 Factors Making It Undervalued - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha Verizon Communications is a leading telecom provider with both the highest revenue and debt levels in the industry. Despite the high pre-tax cost of debt and default risks, the company is stable and is not going bankrupt in the nearest 2-3 years (3 reasons for that). The current market valuation already includes a default risk premium, which makes the stock quite attractive. Our DCF analysis shows that the company is undervalued by about 25% without taking into account a dividend yield of 5%. Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ ) is a leading telecommunication provider in the USA. Its customer base has reached a total of ~110M people by the end of 2014, which caused the total revenues to increase to $130B. The company's key competitors are AT&T (NYSE: T ), Sprint Corp. (NYSE: S ), and T-Mobile US (NASDAQ: TMUS ) with annual sales of $139B, $33B, and $32B, respectively. According to this information, it is clear that VZ has a dominant market position in an oligopolistic market with a duopoly with AT&T. The leading market position makes the company look better than the whole industry due to economies of scale. As you can see in Diagram 1, the company's 3-year revenue CAGR is 2.5 times higher than the industry's average, while the net income growth is astronomic during the same period. The net income growth is the result of above-average operating and net profit margins, which lead to a higher ROA and an enormous ROE ratio. However, the main reason why ROE is so fantastic is the fact that the company is highly indebted. The D/E ratio of 8.0x is enormous and certainly bears high default risks. According to our estimates, the company's pre-tax cost of debt is about 3.9% now. A financial leverage differential of 0.5% (calculated as ROA less pre-tax cost of debt) is very low, so the company may start losing its ROE in the future, if ROA falls. As you can see from Diagram 2, the company faces a declining trend in its "Service revenues and other" segment, which means that a decreasing ROE is on the way. Nevertheless, there is good news, as well. First, the differential is still at a good level. Theoretically, if it regresses to zero, the company will reach its maximum possible ROE. A good debt management means a lot here. Secondly, most of the debt is stretched over a period between 2025 and 2043. The weighted-average maturity is about 17 years, which means that the company has a good liquidity position in the current period (see Diagram 3). Moreover, the company is spending most of the debt on CapEx, which is likely to increase revenues in the future. Accordingly, the wireless equipment services segment's revenue has nearly doubled during the year (see again Diagram 2) and the company has all the chances to capture even better market share in the future. Finally, both the 3- and 9-month OIBDA have increased at nearly the same rate as the revenues (see again Diagram 2). If the dynamics remains the same in the future, Verizon may increase its debt level even more, as the company will be able to generate more cash flows. Nevertheless, we do not consider the probability of this event occurring as high. The good operating results caused the company to bring benefits to its investors. A sustainable dividend yield of ~5% is hard to find anywhere. Moreover, a series of buybacks performed by the company during this period implies that future EPS will increase. It means that the DPS rate will increase, as well, which is certainly good news for dividend investors. However, the stock's total 5-year price performance is poorer than the S&P index's. Moreover, the performance has deteriorated even further during this year. The stock price has been delivering zero price appreciation during the last two years. It looks unreasonable, given its net profit growth, good operating metrics, and an excellent dividend yield. In our opinion, investors are too worried about the large amount of debt the company bears. However, as we mentioned before, it is mostly long term, so there are no bankruptcy risks in the short term. Our discounted cash flow model can be downloaded in the Excel file format, which you can access with this link . In Diagram 5, you can see how different metrics are expected to change during the forecast period. During the modeling process, we had to make several assumptions, which can be examined by the readers in the "Assumptions" tab of our Excel file. We would like readers to notice that they are rather conservative in the Base case. Revenue CAGR projections for the next 7 years are set to be at the 3.5% level, while the last 5-year result is 4.5%. Our model shows that, after subtracting the market value of debt, minority interest and adding back cash and investments, the market value of equity is circa $239.2B in the Base scenario. Consequently, the fair value per share is $58. It is about 25% higher than the current share price ($46.71 per share). The sensitivity tables are presented in Diagram 6. We find the suitable price range for the stock to be between $50-$68 per share. This price range represents a 6%-46% upside potential for the stock. Our comparative analysis's results are presented in Diagram 7. The P/E ratio shows that the stock is undervalued by 20%+, while the P/BV ratio shows that the stock price is grossly overvalued. The main reason for this is high ROE. We like using the EV/EBITDA multiple to arrive at the terminal value. The current EV/EBITDA multiple for Verizon is 8.1x, which is much higher than the industry average of 6.0x (according to Damodaran ). Hence, Verizon's shares seem overvalued. Despite the unsatisfactory results of the comparative analysis, we see that Verizon Communications Inc. is an interesting growth stock with a decent upside potential in the future. The most attractive points about Verizon are: Most debt is not due until 2025-2043. Revenue from the wireless equipment services segment has doubled during the year. OIBDA has increased at the same rate as revenue. The company pays steady dividends growing at a decent rate. Verizon seems undervalued even under conservative assumptions about growth rates and operating metrics. Hence, we issue a BUY recommendation on this stock and set a target price range of $50-68 per share, which translates into a 6%-46% upside opportunity. A high dividend yield of 5% is an additional plus. Verizon Communications Inc. bears currency risks, interest rate risks, macroeconomic, and geopolitical risks. Since these risks are mostly unpredictable, we recommend investors to hedge their positions using different financial instruments. Our valuation of the company is based on current and medium-term business trends and does not include the probability of a force majeure.
