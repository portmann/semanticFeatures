Facebook: New Ventures Set To Take Off - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Rapid growth in Whatsappâ€™s monthly average users since acquisition, nearly doubling from 430 million users to 800 million users. Facebook remains patient in monetizing from the app. Promising venture into ecoomerce, partnership with Shopify. Strong engagement data based on their share of mobile minutes (excluding tablets). At a two-thirds discount to peers based on the EV/EBITDA (TTM) valuation methodology, Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) is trading at a steep discount to peers. Given strong advertising revenue and track record, the discount is unjustified in my view. Consistent with their message since acquiring Whatsapp last year, Facebook is unlikely to be in a rush to monetize their acquisition of Whatsapp. I think their first priority is to grow the number of users of the app and grow rapidly they did. Since their acquisition by Facebook last year, the MAU has nearly doubled from 430 million users to 800 million users. See graph below. My estimation for the end of the second quarter puts the figure at between 850 to 860 million users which is double since the acquisition last year. Facebook has remained coy when quizzed about their monetization strategy for Whatsapp and Instagram. I think their strategy is to rapidly increase the number of users to the app, creating "network externality effect" in terms of the number of users they have. While some in the street have speculated that the monetization strategy will involve having advertisements in the app, I think this is highly unlikely as it will depart from the original founders'initial mission of having no ads in the app. Rather, I think they are likely to reinstate the $0.99 per user fee, which could be once off or charged yearly. Their strategy is increasing the number of users then reduce the impact of churn once they reinstate the costs. Much debate has centered on when Facebook is intending to reinstate the costs and I think the runway is still long when it comes to monetizing the app. Recent developments however are encouraging that Facebook is getting closer to monetizing the app. Whatsapp is now accessible in the desktop and the messages sent and received are fully synced with the mobile device and desktop version. This is similar to the imessage system used on Apple devices. Whatsapp users also can now make voice calls on the app. I think this is another potential avenue to earn fees, similar to Line, where users are charged based on calls made overseas, which is still preferable since it is lower vs. those charged by telcos. Overall, I think it is positive that there is more color on plans on monetizing Whatsapp but remain cautious about their ability to charge fees on users. I think Whatsapp is a little behind the curve compared to their peers Line and Viber and are trying to play catch-up. Promising venture into ecommerce with Shopify . The expansion of testing of native advertisement buy buttons on Facebook is built on a back-end of Shopify's ecommerce technology. I believe the venture into ecommerce with Shopify fits their overall strategy of increasing ad revenues. Users of Facebook who click on the button to purchase items will increase the conversion rate, resulting in improvements in ROI, and advertisers will be more inclined to increase the number of ads at a possibly higher price. With Facebook gaining ground with stronger share of mobile minutes, this share of mobile minutes exclude those from tablets and only calculates those from smartphones and desktops. According to data from comscore , Facebook's share was about 20% last year, July 2014, and it has since risen to 24% in May 2015. Regular readers know my strong preference for the EV/EBITDA valuation matrix for valuing technology companies. A more detailed explanation of the valuation methodology is explained in my initiation report on JD.com . Based on their last closing price on 14th July 2015, their EV/EBITDA valuation methodology that compares FB with Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) and LinkedIn (NYSE: LNKD ), FB is trading at a discount to the industry average, or more aptly, to LinkedIn (since Twitter is EBITDA negative). At 34.74x, this represents a 66.4%, almost two-thirds discount to what investors are willing to pay for LinkedIn, even though Facebook is profitable vs. both Twitter and LinkedIn, which makes the current valuations investors will pay for Facebook extremely undemanding. I think there remains a long path to monetization for both Whatsapp and Instagram. But there is strong commitment from the management to catch up with their peers and expand their user base. Furthermore, as at the last closing price on the 14th of July 2015, FB is trading at an extremely steep discount to LinkedIn which is unjustified.
