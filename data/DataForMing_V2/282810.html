What Do Ford's December Sales Reveal? - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. Record sales reported in December bode well for Ford stock as entire industry witnesses upsurge. Ford's strengths are now its capital deployment and resource consolidation. 2015 Annual Report should give a boost to stock price, opening up an ideal entry point for potential F buyers. On January 5, 2016, Ford (NYSE: F ) reported the company's best annual sales numbers in a record nine years. Total sales touched 2,613,162 vehicles in the U.S., thus making Ford America's best-selling auto brand for the sixth straight year . Though Ford lost considerable market share in 2015 (more about that later), the upsurge in sales for the light truck segment lifted Ford's numbers as it did the others'. The last time sales in this segment went above 17.4 million was in 2000. This past year it recorded a 15-year high of 17.47 million, and Ford was among those who drove those numbers. With the rising tide, Ford's overall sales have been steadily inching up since the U.S. auto industry slump in 2008. Between 2012 and the end of 2015, overall sales for Ford have gone from 2.168 million to 2.613 million - an increase of more than 20%. Coming to December 2015, of the 239,242 vehicles sold by Ford during the month, nearly 35% (85,211) was accounted for by Ford's F-Series pickup truck. The truck has been a stellar performer for Ford over the years, with the company moving a whopping 780,354 trucks in 2015. From the graph above, you can see that December sales were within a stone's throw of its best sales month for 2015 - May. Was there a specific reason for this sudden increase? Let's see. With sales declining from August 2015, it was almost a given assumption that the company would end the year with a fizzle rather than a bang. What supported that sudden spurt? Some sources refer to dropping fuel prices as a strong driver of large-car sales in the United States, but there's no evidence to support that. In fact, one study by the Fuel Institute suggests that there's actually no major correlation between buyer habits and the sale of any particular segment of car. So if it's not simply a question of lower fuel prices driving higher sales, then what's the reason? Surprisingly, it was far simpler than that! Here's what I noticed with the auto industry's performance in the United States. The U.S. auto market has been on a steady growth trajectory since the recession, hitting an all-time high of a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 17.22 million units. This was considerably lower than the forecasted 18 million, yet a major positive for car manufacturers. What's more relevant to the discussion here is that Ford's fortunes at home seem to depend largely on the performance of the industry as a whole. That's not a discovery in itself. In fact, it stands to reason that every car manufacturer will ideally follow the same mirror-trend against overall industry figures. My point here is that the credit for spiking sales in December do not reflect Ford's performance in the United States as accurately as its market share drop does. Having established that, I then started to look deeper into Ford's position in the United States, and that's a completely different story from the positive note we've been on so far. What's Really Happening At Ford U.S.? Despite what looks like record-breaking performance from the 112-year-old carmaker, the true pulse of the company can be found in its home market in the United States - currently the highest revenue earner for the company. That market, although not on a shaky ground by any standards, is being threatened by the Number Three incumbent in the market share race. Post the recession that affected all carmakers across the board, Ford's market share has been on a gradual decline. From a peak of 17.3% in 2Q 2011, it went down as low as 14.1% in 2Q of 2014. As of 3Q 2015, Ford's market share in the United States was 14.9%. What's masking this problem is its overall sales figures. It's something I'd expect the executives at Ford to be worried about, considering that Toyota is once again breathing down its necks. As of December 2015, Ford managed to retain its slim 60-basis-point market share lead over the Japanese manufacturer, but that's no guarantee of continuing one-upmanship in this cutthroat market. The one thing that offsets this threat - from a shareholder's perspective - is the fact that its operating margins are improving. One of the contributors to that margin improvement is the fact that over the years, Ford has been consolidating its global manufacturing platforms. The objective has been to cut costs, so even though we're seeing some gains now, the bulk of gains will be seen over the next few years in the form of further margin improvement. Investor-speak: What Does 4Q 2015 and Beyond Hold for Ford? Even though North America is the only region that's significantly profitable right now, that situation may well change over the next few quarters. As I discussed in an earlier article on Ford's European division , that market is all set to show positive income. Ford's 3Q operating margin improved from -6.4% to -2.6% between 2014 and 2015, and I see that further improving in Q4. Its YTD income before taxes stood at -$381 million as of 3Q 2015 against -$1062 million for the fiscal 2014. And now, I believe its December figures will feature heavily in its annual report for 2015 due at the end of January 2016. Also highlighted will be its operating margin improvement over 2014. In addition, the fact that its capital deployment is getting more efficient, its restructuring in Europe is gaining traction, and it has a robust expansion plan in place will all contribute to 2016's performance. Putting all these together, I expect share price will be given a boost shortly after the report is out. In fact, the spike might be significant if it can repeat the kind of earnings surprise it delivered in 2Q 2015. This is probably the best time to BUY Ford if you're thinking of adding them to your portfolio. Existing shareholders should seriously consider adding on as much as they can at this time.
