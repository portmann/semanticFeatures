Netflix: Poised To Shift Into Top Gear | Seeking Alpha Netflix: Poised To Shift Into Top Gear Netflix is in talks with the hosts of the popular TV Program Top Gear. Top Gear has nearly 6 times as many viewers as Netflix has subscribers. Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) currently has 62 million subscribers worldwide. They are in talks with the hosts and producer of the popular British motoring show, Top Gear. Top Gear has roughly 350 million viewers worldwide. These numbers sound very good for Netflix. In recent years Netflix, a company best known for streaming movies and TV shows has began to produce their own material. Shows such as House of Cards and Orange is the New Black have been wildly successful, leading to a substantial growth in subscribers. Exclusive content like this helps Netflix draw in new subscribers as well as retain current ones. House of Cards (which cost Netflix $100 million) paid for itself in 3 months, proving the effectiveness of this strategy. Sticking with the House of Cards example, we get to the issue of potentially slowing growth. Eventually, Netflix will reach a point where they can no longer grow at the current rate; that is inevitable. I don't see Netflix reaching that point for many years. China and India (countries that don't have Netflix) were the top two locations for illegal downloaders of the show. The fact that there is strong demand for Netflix content in these two countries is very promising for potential expansion in the coming years. Although Netflix doesn't release total views figures, the strong growth in subscribers over the past few years makes it quite clear that the model is working. People are going to Netflix for new exclusive content as well as older content. The risk associated with it is that nobody will like the content since it is essentially new. With Top Gear, Netflix has eliminated this risk. Top Gear is the most viewed factual TV program in the world with roughly 350 million viewers (let's not forget that Netflix only has 62 million subscribers). Furthermore it is the BBC's most profitable program, earning $226 million in advertising revenue in 2014. Essentially, Top Gear is a proven winner. With their version of Top Gear, Netflix will have content that has already proven itself to be world class along with enormous preexisting demand for that content. The demand for the Netflix Top Gear will be far greater than the demand for any other Netflix content. Netflix will not be producing a show called "Top Gear". The BBC still owns that name so Netflix won't be getting it. Netflix will get the show's three hosts (Jeremy Clarkson, James May, and Richard Hammond) as well as the executive producer. The BBC will continue to produce Top Gear, but without the key players it won't be a viable threat to Netflix. The Sunday Mirror reported that Netflix is "very close" to striking a deal. Richard Hammond and James May have both refused to work without Jeremy Clarkson. This knocks the BBC out of the running for keeping the three, since Clarkson is long gone. There are reportedly other players such as Sky Network involved, but Netflix is the only one in negotiations with the three. Netflix has a lot to gain from the Top Gear crew, but very little to lose. They have already established themselves as leaders in the streaming world. If this deal doesn't come to fruition, Netflix will simply continue with business as usual. If the deal does happen, Netflix is poised to reap enormous benefits. I believe that this deal has the potential to add a lot of value for Netflix and is certainly worth keeping an eye on over the coming weeks.
