Apple: Reversing My Call, Stock Is A Buy Once Again - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple has been on a sustained, 15% downtrend since earnings last quarter, around the time of my last Apple article, in which I advised investors not to buy the stock. Apple's discounted valuation multiples frustrate investors, but at $130 per share, Apple was not as cheap as it seemed when compared to its own average multiples. Investors may have to get used to the prospect that Apple won't ever earn a market multiple. However, now that Apple is significantly cheaper again, the stock is a buy. The recent downturn in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) stock has caught many analysts and investors by surprise. Earlier this year, as Apple hit $130 and above, I couldn't shake the feeling that Apple was due for a correction, which is why I advised investors its recent highs were a good time to take some profits. I wrote this article , published on March 19, right on the heels of the statement made by Carl Icahn that he believed Apple was worth $240 per share right now. Icahn is a legendary investor, but I disagreed with his conclusion. I believed he was making some very unrealistic predictions about Apple's growth trajectory, and more broadly, I felt investors in general were getting a little too ahead of themselves with Apple. The day that article was published, Apple stock closed at $130 per share. I advised investors that Apple's valuation was not as cheap as it seemed, and the stock was not a compelling buy. I argued that even though Apple traded for a seemingly cheap multiple (around 18 times trailing earnings), Apple is not valued like most other stocks, and that lower multiples were entirely possible, especially if future growth didn't live up to expectations. Sure enough, Apple's valuation has contracted again, based on these same fears. Thanks to its recent dip, Apple investors once again have a buying opportunity on their hands. Why Apple Didn't Go Up After Last Quarter's Earnings When Apple stock declines, the common refrain is typically a mix of confusion and despair. Many investors become frustrated that such a highly profitable, growing company like Apple could be valued at below the market multiple, when its growth rate and business quality are so impressive. But there are a few things investors need to understand about Apple. First is that Apple doesn't trade like other stocks. As a technology company, the market is always looking ahead, not back. The market had already anticipated Apple was going to crush Q2 and Q3 earnings, which it surely did. Indeed, Apple's growth this year has been nothing short of spectacular. Last quarter , Apple's revenue and earnings per share soared 32% and 45%, respectively, year over year. Through the first three fiscal quarters, Apple has generated an amazing $60 billion of free cash flow, up from $40 billion in the same year-over-year period. But again, the market had already priced in a lot of this, which is why Apple stock didn't rise much after reporting last quarter's earnings. The rationale for my previous article was that at near $130 per share, Apple traded for a deceptively high multiple. At 16-18 times earnings, Apple stock looked cheap when compared to the broader market, but I argued that the stock wasn't actually all that cheap when compared to its own historical multiples. As investors, I believe we may all have to accept a new normal as it pertains to Apple's valuation, which is that Apple simply doesn't trade for a market multiple. There are a couple of key reasons for this. First, Apple is a technology company. It may be extremely confusing to see low-growth consumer goods companies like Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO ) trading at 25 times EPS. But Coca-Cola doesn't have the same risk profile. For the most part, Coca-Cola investors don't have to worry about a startup company nobody has ever heard of someday releasing a breakthrough beverage product that puts Coca-Cola out of business. Second, Apple stock gets an inevitable discount because of how huge it is. At $130 per share, Apple's market capitalization teetered at $700 billion. These are uncharted waters for investors, and the market seems to doubt how much bigger Apple can realistically become. Again, this carries a discount. Lastly, Apple stock suffers from an inconsistent growth trajectory. With so much of its business dependent on the iPhone (63% of total revenue last quarter), Apple's growth is essentially contained to when the next iPhone gets released. This results in inevitable lulls in Apple's growth, like in 2012-2013 after the release of the iPhone 5. Even though the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c helped keep Apple afloat, the company's earnings actually declined for a brief period. As I wrote in the article linked above, Apple looked alarmingly cheap in 2012 at 15 times earnings, but that didn't stop the stock from falling by nearly half, and its multiple contracting all the way to 9 times earnings. This isn't Apple's fault; in fact, it's merely a consequence of brutally tough comparisons. Nevertheless, the year after a major iPhone release, Apple is made a victim of its own success. The market has trouble anticipating whether Apple will be able to keep earnings steady the following year, and once again, investors sell first and ask questions later. After The 15% Correction, It's Back To A Buy Over the long-term, these fluctuations smooth themselves out. But they still create profitable and actionable opportunities for investors. As a result, my personal investing approach to Apple is that the best time to initiate a position or build upon an existing position is during these lulls, and the best time to trim a position and take profits is when Apple has harvested the fruits of its newest iPhone, like the last two quarters for example. That was the conclusion of my previous article. At $130 per share, investors were simply buying at too high of a multiple for Apple, given the tough comparisons that are coming next fiscal year. At 13 times earnings however, Apple is once again a buying opportunity. Just as I did in 2013, I would initiate a 25% or 33% position here, then wait to see if the market really starts to freak out about next year, and buy on any continued dip.
