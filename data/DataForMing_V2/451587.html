Apple Hospitality REIT: Broad U.S. Exposure And A 6.35% Yield - Apple Hospitality REIT, Inc. (NYSE:APLE) | Seeking Alpha Apple Hospitality REIT Inc is undervalued with a high yield. Company is a fairly new public company and its history is short. Suburban US hotels will do better than central business district hotels in an economic downturn and high-dollar environment. Hotel REITs are a relatively new player on the block, and as of now they are either undervalued or under owned, depending upon how one looks at it. I believe most hotel REITs are cheap because there is worry that weak economic growth in Europe, Asia and China will hurt international arrivals in the US, especially with a higher US Dollar. Indeed, most hotel REITs I have seen own high-end hotels in coastal 'gateway' cities, and many of those hotels are indeed right in the path of a higher dollar and a weaker Europe or Asia. There just isn't much insulation in many of these names. One possible exception to this is Apple Hospitality REIT Inc (NYSE: APLE ). Apple owns 30,000 rooms in 234 hotels, all of which are either Hilton hotels or Marriott hotels, and all of which are operated by other franchisees.

Business is concentrated in Texas and the South. Also, notice that a clear majority of Apple's hotels are in suburban areas. This gives apple a certain insularity and a US-traveler focus that, I believe, should go a long way to protect the business if the US Dollar does continue to appreciate. At the very least, this gives Apple a somewhat-unique value proposition. In general, I prefer central business districts to suburbs when it comes to hotel markets, because the former typically has a stronger economy and space is more limited there. However, in a global economic downturn, I believe suburban locations will fare better than central business districts, which tend to be more internationally-linked. For this reason, I believe Apple Hospitality is worth looking at. From what I've seen, Apple Hospitality should perform about in line with the domestic hotel industry, specifically in growth of revenue per average room, or RevPAR. According to industry experts, domestic industry RevPAR is expected to grow 5% in 2016 and another 4.5% in 2017. Apple Hospitality, in the first quarter, increased RevPAR 4%, and on the full year expects to grow RevPAR by 4.5%. Revenue increased 4.2% year-on-year, and adjusted EBITDA jumped 6.8%, largely because margins grew another 60 basis points. This is the benefit of low energy costs, which have effectively frozen utility expenses for this company. For a hotel REIT, Apple is modestly leveraged, with debt at just 3.1 times trailing EBITDA. Contrast that with Pebblebrook Hotel Trust (NYSE: PEB ), another one I've written about, whose debt is around 5 times EBITDA. Courtesy of Apple Hospitality REIT, Investor Relations. Apple Hospitality, after merging with affiliate Apple REIT Ten, will have a staggered maturity schedule, with a little over $300 million coming due in 2016 and 2017. I strongly suspect that management will roll these into senior notes. With the existing divided and capex policy, there isn't any excess cash to go around. Upon looking at this chart, one might wonder whether Apple's generous, 10 cent per month dividend is sustainable. I believe that it is, and I believe that capex will either be successfully financed by additional debt, or that capex will be reduced, depending upon market acquisition circumstances. As a publicly traded REIT, Apple Hospitality doesn't have much of a history, but that is where I believe this company is going. Right now Apple yields 6.3% in dividends, and sits at 11.1 times FFO. Like most hotel REITs, Apple Hospitality is firmly in the bargain bin. For income investors, this is an opportunity to get a high yield with the relative safety of the US economy. Is the dividend safe? I think that it is, but that dividend depends upon Apple Hospitality's continued access to the credit market. Yes, this is a levered income play, but that leverage is fairly reasonable. I believe that, given both the rewards and the risks, Apple Hospitality REIT is a buy.
