Alibaba: Beating Apple At Its Game - Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) | Seeking Alpha BABA introduced a YunOS-operated smartwatch that works along with its Alipay mobile payment system. The Pay Watch will likely strengthen BABA's position in China's mobile payment space. Just when Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is trying to make inroads in China with its Apple Pay, Alibaba's (NYSE: BABA ) payment affiliate Ant Financial recently released a payment-focused smartwatch, PayWatch, in partnership with FiiSmart. This once again highlights the strength of the Chinese incumbents in the mobile payment field and the challenges that AAPL will likely to face as it rolls out its services in China. In my view, the Chinese incumbents have far more resources, channel networks and strategic partnerships that allow them to roll out competing services in a short period to challenge AAPL, which is required to undergo various regulatory and business development processes. Given that the mobile payment market is already dominated by BABA and Tencent ( OTCPK:TCEHY ), AAPL's entry into this space will become increasingly difficult. I remain bullish on BABA and cautious on AAPL. My thesis on BABA remains that the company is building its own ecosystem that is supportive of its core e-commerce business and the growing O2O in mobile payment. Alternatively, my thesis on AAPL is that while near-term demand for the hardware will likely to be strong, long-term demand for AAPL's services in software and payment will be a challenge due to competitive and regulatory pressure. BABA is partnering with FiiSmart to roll out its own mobile OS, "YunOS", that supports Alipay along with other functions. Worth reminding investors that Alipay controls 80% of China's mobile payment market via its mobile app on both iOS and Android. It is the preferred payment option for e-commerce, offline retail (QR code) and O2O (restaurant, movie and taxi booking). Rival Tencent has around 10% of the market share thanks to its WeChat mobile messenger, which is growing to be an ecosystem of its own. The YunOS smartwatch has a 1.63-in AMOLED display and powered by dual-core CPU with a 4GB storage. Other features include Bluetooth and magnetic charging, and a battery that supports 45 hours of usage. The Pay Watch is the first wearable device that supports BABA's own mobile OS. In comparison, the Apple Watch sports a 1.32-inch display and 18 hours of battery life. BABA's model is superior on paper, but it is still not clear on how good it is in terms of user experience. Given the fact that the FiiSmart is oriented around BABA's Alipay, which is supported by over 130k offline retailers across China, the user is able to make payments by scanning QR codes on the watch and the payments are transferred from the user's Alipay account to the merchant even if there is no network coverage. In terms of security, an infrared sensor locks the display if it detects that the device is detached from the wearer's wrist. Besides payments, other features such as health, weather and notifications are also featured on the device. The starting price is $109. For the AAPL bulls, it is worth noting that Alipay is widely used on the Apple Watch in China given BABA's dominant position in China's mobile payment space so this could potentially conflict AAPL's goal of mass-market Apple Pay. This underscores my view that AAPL does not have a clear strategy in rolling out Apple Pay that can differentiate or compete head-on against the incumbents. I reiterate my bullish view on BABA and cautious view on AAPL.
