ETF Hub With the recent fall in the stock price, patience remains the key to investing in Yahoo. The price remains to be undervalued, even more so now that investors are concerned about statements from an IRS official. These comments change nothing about the Alibaba spin off. Yahoo Inc. (NASDAQ: YHOO ) continues to be undervalued by investors, with recent comments from an IRS lawyer causing the stock price to fall over 3.5%. While the news and subsequent fall of the stock price could be concerning to investors and cause some to abandon the investment, patience is the key here. Even with the potential stumbling block to the Alibaba spin off, Yahoo remains undervalued and worth holding on to. Much of what drives Yahoo's stock price is its stake in Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA ), which CEO Marissa Mayer plans to spin off in a tax-free transaction during the fourth quarter of this year. This can be seen by Yahoo jumping nearly 8% after Alibaba's most recent, positive earnings report. Now, a lawyer from the IRS has commented that the organization is weighing changes to tax-free spinoffs, especially in cases similar to Yahoo's planned spin off. While the potential for complications surrounding the Alibaba spin off exist, they are extremely unlikely. For one, the regulations haven't actually changed yet. Even if such a change does pass, it is more likely to affect the ability to return the value in the stake of Yahoo Japan ( OTCPK:YAHOF ) than that of Alibaba. Yahoo filed its request to spin off the company, along with its operating business Yahoo Small Business, during the first quarter. Any applicable changes are unlikely to affect this spin off. However, even if they did somehow cause the Alibaba holdings to be fully taxed, the current value is still roughly where Yahoo would be valued. Unless there's an absolute certainty that the Alibaba stake will be fully taxed (it won't), then the stock price should be trading higher. The IRS official said that transactions already under consideration would continue to be handled normally for the time being, adding credence to the fact that the planned spin off will go as planned. The fact that Yahoo is still undervalued, even with the increased potential of the Alibaba spin off being taxed, is supported by recent activity from market analysts. Citigroup Inc. recently reiterated its buy rating for the stock and has assigned it a target price of $56.00. Meanwhile, Evercore ISI analysts actually downgraded the stock to hold and lowered to a target price to $48.00. Even with the low price target of $48.00, the upside is still 11% currently. When the IRS comments come to nothing, as I highly suspect they will, the stock price will immediately jump back up, although it will still likely be undervalued. Market analysts have a consensus recommendation of buy concerning Yahoo, according to Yahoo Finance, with every analyst giving a recommendation of at least a hold. This also supports the need to be patient with this stock as the value is still there. With most of the attention around the stock being paid to the proposed Alibaba spin off, along with the stake in Yahoo Japan, what's happening with the core of the business seems to be overlooked. When Mayer took over the company, all of its revenue streams were decreasing mainly because of increased competition for programmatic advertising. With the company model having been based off of display advertising, Mayer decided to make the company a mobile-first one. In order to do so, an emphasis was put on mobile apps as well as ways to monetize these apps. Mayer called this MaVeNS, short for Mobile, Video, Native and Social. This business segment has seen incredible progress since 2011 when it accounted for only tens of millions in revenue. Last year, these strategic initiatives accounted for $1.1 billion in revenue. That kind of quick growth is astounding and is not given enough attention. What Mayer and Yahoo are doing is cultivating these business strategies like a startup, while doing the best to maintain its traditional business - display advertising. One acquisition that has played a large part in making the growth of the mobile business possible is Flurry, a mobile apps analytics firm. Flurry is implemented into 700,000 different apps and is present in 1.7 billion smartphones. Truly remarkable figures. This service helps with third party advertisements on these apps, putting the advertisements in the right places to target the desired demographics. Along with the homegrown Gemini advertising platforms, advertisers can customize their campaigns to target the desired demographic, sorted by different factors such as locations, ages, gender or device. Looking ahead to the next earnings report, I am much more interested in the progress of the MaVeNS businesses than the traditional display business as it is where the future of the company is located. I Know First self-learning algorithm uses artificial intelligence, predictive models based on artificial neural networks, and genetic algorithms to predict money movements within various markets. The algorithm produces a forecast with a signal and a predictability indicator. The signal is the number in the middle of the box. The predictability is the number at the bottom of the box. At the top, a specific asset is identified. This format is consistent across all predictions. The middle number is indicative of strength and direction, not a price target. The bottom number, the predictability, signifies a confidence level. The algorithmic analysis for both the three-month and one-year forecasts for Yahoo is especially strong. The one-year forecast has an especially strong signal strength of 161.94. This is not a price target of predicted percentage change but is a strong indicator that the stock price is currently undervalued. A signal strength of 0 would indicate it was properly valued while a negative signal strength indicates a stock is overvalued. (click to enlarge) Figure 3. Long-Term Algorithmic Forecast For Yahoo. The algorithm's belief that the stock price is currently undervalued fits with the fundamental analysis of the company as well as with that of market analysts. The current price is way too low and there's significant upside potential for this stock with very little risk. The recent comments from the IRS should not harm Yahoo's attempts to spin off the company and concerns were far overblown. Even though the stock slightly recovered some of its losses already, it is still trading below where it was and should be higher than that, even. Along with the rapid growth of the mobile business, patient investors should buy Yahoo at the current prices.
