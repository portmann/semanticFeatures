Daily Mail parent in talks with private equity for Yahoo bid: WSJ | Reuters A Yahoo logo is pictured in front of a building in Rolle, 30 km (19 miles) east of Geneva, in this file picture taken December 12, 2012. The parent company of the British newspaper, the Daily Mail, is in talks with several private equity firms about a possible bid for Yahoo Inc, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday. Daily Mail & General Trust PLCâ€™s potential bid could take one of two forms, according to the report, citing people familiar with the matter. In one scenario, a private-equity partner would acquire Yahooâ€™s core web business, with the Mail taking over the news and media properties. In the other scenario, the private-equity firm would acquire Yahooâ€™s core web business and merge its media and news properties with the Mailâ€™s online operations. The merged units would form a new company that would be run by the Mail and give a larger equity stake to the Mailâ€™s parent company than under the first scenario, according to the Wall Street Journal report. Time Inc is also considering partnering with a private equity firm on a bid for Yahoo's core Internet assets, Reuters reported earlier this month.
