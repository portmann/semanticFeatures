What Can We Learn from the Guy Who Sold Apple in 1976? - The Big Picture My Sunday Washington Post Business Section column is out. This morning, we discussÂ Ronald Wayne, the third co-founder of Apple. He was there from the beginning, and owned 10% of theÂ original Apple. He sold it for $800 after 12 days of working with the 2 Steves. Not counting new dilution — outside VC investors, the IPO, and more share issuanceÂ —Â that $800 would be worth about $63 billion today. Even with all of the actual dilution,Â its in the billions.
