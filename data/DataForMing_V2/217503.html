Could ESPN Smash Disney's Star Wars Success? - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Oct. 27, 2015 11:27 AM ET  |  About: The Walt Disney Company (DIS) , Includes: CBS , CMCSA , CMCSK , FOX , FOXA , TWX by: Dana Blankenhorn ESPN has been the tentpole of Disney earnings for years. Those earnings are collapsing in the rise of rights fees. There is one thing we know for certain about Disney (NYSE: DIS ). Its purchase of Marvel for $4 billion in 2009 and of Lucasfilm for another $4 billion in 2012 were among the best deals of the last decade. Now that those deals are coming good - the Marvel deal already has and "Star Wars" will be the biggest box office hit of this year - you might feel like piling in. There are a lot of people advising it. Full disclosure. I've been accumulating Disney shares for my own retirement account over the last two years and I'm not advising a sell. But I have to wonder for how long that will be the case given the squeeze at one of the company's prime properties, ESPN. ESPN announced last week it is cutting 300 people, mainly in production, and this follows the higher-profile axing of Keith Olbermann and of Bill Simmons, the latter of whom was quickly picked up by HBO. Colin Cowherd also left this year for Fox (NASDAQ: FOX ) (NASDAQ: FOXA ), and ESPN's firing of him after he quit was one of the most transparently stupid moves of the year in sports media. Soccer analysis Alexi Lalas left when his contract expired, also for Fox, and a lot of the on-air talent is also anxiously waiting on the expiration of their own contracts. Expect to see a lot less-crowded desks outside football stadia. The problem lies inside those stadia Pressed Fox, NBCsn (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) (NASDAQ: CMCSK ) and Turner Broadcasting (NYSE: TWX ), not to mention Al Jazeera's BEin Sports unit and even little CBS (NYSE: CBS ), ESPN has been overpaying for sports broadcast rights for most of this decade. Those chickens are now coming home to roost. ESPN thought it had a backstop for that with its ESPN3 and WatchESPN services - the latter is a forced upsell on many cable Internet bills - but they have not been picking up the slack. Since 2013, according to Sports Business Daily, ESPN has plowed over $3 billion into new sports rights deals. It thought it could make up for all that by jacking up the price it charged cable subscribers, but it is now losing subscribers, having reduced the cable operators' guarantees on how many would take the $6/subscriber fee in order to get the raise. By 2017, it will be barely breaking even on rights deals, paying $5.86 per subscriber per month while taking in the $6. By axing producers and talent, meanwhile, ESPN cuts off the possibility it might recoup some of those losses with other compelling programming. What it means is that, unless it can get other broadcasters to cooperate and not bid-up rights contracts (and there is no indication of that), ESPN is about to become a drag on Disney's earnings, rather than a support structure.
