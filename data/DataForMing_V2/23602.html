Apple Pay: Why CurrentC Is No Threat - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha A consortium of retailers has announced that mobile payments system CurrentC will start operation in mid-2015. CurrentC is a merchant oriented payment system designed to circumvent the current credit/debit card system. With Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Pay becoming ever more widely adopted by card issuers and more widely accepted by retailers, mobile payments was bound to see new entrants. The latest to emerge is CurrentC, backed by a consortium of retailers such as Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) and Best Buy (NYSE: BBY ). CurrentC will go live some time in the middle of the year. Does CurrentC pose a threat Apple Pay? No, it's hardly credible competition. Whenever Apple comes out with a ground breaking product, there's an immediate scramble by its competitors to cobble together a solution that superficially resembles the Apple product. The lack of attention to detail, the creaky, unreliable nature of these "competitive" products is usually immediately apparent. Such is the case with CurrentC. CurrentC represents a direction that Apple might have gone if it hadn't come up with the better approach of Apple Pay. CurrentC basically takes the iOS Passbook approach for gift cards, boarding tickets, etc., and applies it to debit card payments. In Passbook, you show a scannable bar or QR code that corresponds to some prepaid card, the merchant scans this and the value of the purchase is deducted. CurrentC works the same way, except that purchases are deducted from the users bank account via ACH transfer. In effect, the CurrentC app user (there'll be apps for iOS and Android) is authorizing the CurrentC consortium, Merchant Customer Exchange (MCX) to make an ACH transfer from the customer's account to the member retailer's bank. So MCX has to have stored your bank account information and is involved with every transaction the customer makes with CurrentC. In every important respect - ease of use, privacy and security - CurrentC is inferior to Apple Pay. Let's look at each of these areas. Passbook kind of made sense if you had a lot of gift cards or prepaid cards that you didn't want to carry around with you. However, the process of presenting the scannable bar code in CurrentC doesn't appear to be significantly easier than just swiping a debit card. Either way you have to enter a pass code, and the time it takes to scan the bar code is about what it takes to swipe the debit card. As an alternative, CurrentC merchant terminals can present a bar code to be scanned by the customer's phone. Then the CurrentC app sends the ACH authorization request to MCX. This has all the pitfalls of smartphone photography: the customer has to orient the smart phone camera properly, get the bar code in focus, hold the camera steady, then take what amounts to a picture of the bar code. Simple. While one might argue that this is no less convenient than swiping a debit card, it's certainly less convenient than holding your iPhone over an Apple Pay terminal. The key pillars of Apple Pay security are ignorance, and ignorance. Once a credit or debit card is added to your Apple Pay enabled Passbook, Apple deletes your card information from its servers, which was encrypted anyway. From that point on, it's just between you and your bank, and Apple doesn't know anything more about your card or your purchases with it. Ignorance is bliss. Ignorance means that Apple's vulnerability to hacking is very low. Most of the time there's nothing to hack. The other important form of ignorance for Apple Pay is in the user's phone. The iPhone doesn't even carry the card information around. Instead, it carries a device ID (essentially a random number string) that the bank associates with your account. In addition, the device ID is stored in a special chip called a secure element, which no other component of the iPhone, hardware or software, can access. These safeguards are mostly lacking with CurrentC. MCX does store customer account information. It has to for the system to work. MCX assures us that the data is encrypted and secure. Makes you feel so much better, doesn't it? The CurrentC app doesn't have a secure element to make use of, so that layer of security is missing as well. CurrentC does probably use a device ID system similar to Apple's but then, that can be sent (in encrypted form) over wireless networks to authorize payment when the smartphone scans a CurrentC terminal barcode. MCX is very upfront in its pitch to merchants about customer privacy. There is none. Merchants will have the opportunity to exploit customer purchase history in order to offer special targeted discounts and promotional deals. Your purchase data is an important product to MCX members. CurrentC is a product architected not for the benefit of the consumer but for the benefit of the merchants who are members of MCX. Unfortunately for MCX, the key feature most appealing to merchants will be the downfall of CurrentC. CurrentC is all about circumventing the current debit/credit card authorization system and the fees that merchants are required to pay for each transaction. For that reason, CurrentC does not support cannot support bank credit cards except for merchant supported cards. This makes CurrentC relatively inflexible compared to Apple Pay. Apple's decision to offer Apple Pay as an augmentation to the current credit card authorization system was the smartest thing Apple did. It meant that card issuers got on board with Apple Pay with no reservations. Apple now has more than 180 card issuers . Adoption of Apple Pay by retailers has been slower primarily because of the cost of the new NFC terminals. Not needing NFC is the sole advantage of CurrentC, but it will prove short lived. In the end, CurrentC is just another example of a group of businesses trying to fight the future. NFC based digital payments are the future, and Apple has skated to where this puck will be. The MCX merchants will try to force customers to use CurrentC. They'll bar Apple Pay, as some member companies already have. They'll offer incentives such as discounts, rewards points, "free" gifts in order to encourage CurrentC use. It may work for a while. Large retailers such as Wal-Mart and Best Buy have some clout. MCX also has indicated that it might adopt other technologies in the future, opening the door to some form of radio based (Bluetooth or NFC) payment system. In that case, they'll be starting well behind the curve. In any case, NFC based payments will eventually replace all magnetic stripe card readers. It almost doesn't matter whether CurrentC or any other competing mobile payments system is successful. Although we don't know much about Apple Pay monetization, we know that it probably doesn't work like conventional credit cards. Since Apple doesn't track user transactions, it's unlikely to collect a per transaction fee, which is the norm for participants in the current credit card payment authorization system. The most likely point where Apple can collect a fee is when an Apple Pay user adds a credit or debit card. We know this doesn't cost the user anything, so if anyone is paying Apple, it would have to be the card issuer. Judging by the level of support by card issuers, that fee, if any, must be very reasonable. Judging by Apple's SEC filing for the December 2014 quarter, those fees are probably negligible. Apple Pay revenue is booked under the Services category, and Apple Pay came on line in the December quarter. The Apple Services segment booked only a 4% sequential gain over the September quarter, going from $4.6 to $4.8 billion. Hardly a cash cow. The importance of Apple Pay is as a value added service similar to iCloud for iOS users. It enhances the value of iPhone, increases sales, but doesn't of itself generate a lot of revenue. From a revenue standpoint, it almost doesn't matter whether CurrentC or any other mobile payment system is successful. As long as Apple offers the best mobile payment service, and the service finds widespread support through NFC terminals, Apple Pay will achieve its primary mission of making the iPhone even more desirable.
