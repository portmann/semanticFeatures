Crony Capitalism At Work - Boeing Threatens To Leave US If Ex-Im Subsidy Yanked | Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site!

Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! Submitted by Veronique De Rugy via The National Review, When has crony capitalism really gotten out of control? How about when a major U.S. corporation (a huge defense contractor, no less) is publicly threatening government officials to leave the country if the federal government doesn’t continue to boost their profits through government handouts: Boeing is stepping up pressure on opponents of the US Export-Import Bank with threats to shift manufacturing abroad if the agency that finances purchases by foreign customers is killed off next month. The threats come as a new push is being made in Congress to find ways of wresting reauthorisation of the bank from a committee controlled by one of the agency’s fiercest opponents. Scott Scherer, Boeing’s head of regulatory strategy at Boeing Capital, said the aerospace and defense group would “not sit idly by” if the ExIm Bank’s mandate was not renewed by the end of June. “Boeing is not going to let itself be hurt by the lack of an ExIm Bank,” he said in an interview with the Financial Times. “If it means sourcing … to other countries who will support us we may have to look at that. Other countries have more aggressive export policies. We will find an alternative.” First, let me state the obvious: This basically sounds like blackmail to me, and I don’t think lawmakers should look at this kind of behavior favorably. Second, it’s time for Boeing executives to understand that it’s not the role of the federal government to guarantee that they can sell as many planes as possible — they’ve benefited from the U.S.’s relatively free-market system; they should have to live with it. And finally, I don’t think Boeing’s threat is very credible. Will Boeing really pick up its factories and move abroad if Ex-Im isn’t reauthorized? Is the possibility other governments might subsidize it really worth the transition costs and the risks of losing billions in defense contracts? Thankfully, Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the House committee with jurisdiction over Ex-Im, called Boeing’s bluff: The Republican chairman of the House Financial Services Committee rejected reports that Boeing Co. or other companies might move production overseas if Congress doesn’t reauthorize the U.S. Export-Import bank. “I doubt I believe it,” Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas said at a Washington press conference Tuesday about whether failing to extend the bank’s charter would drive major corporations out of the U.S. “I think it’s frankly a bit of bluster.” Boeing, based in Chicago, might move some manufacturing overseas if Congress doesn’t extend the bank’s charter beyond June 30, the Financial Times reported May 17. It cited an interview with Scott Scherer, head of regulatory strategy at Boeing Capital. Hensarling said he and others who oppose reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank are trying to “lead the party in a new direction” that will give priority to free enterprise over individual business interests. Letting the Ex-Im Bank’s charter expire will go a long way to show that Republicans understand the difference between being pro-business and being pro-market — even if Boeing doesn’t.

Another top beneficiary, General Electric, has given between $500,000 and $1 million. ... Boeing can leave if it wants to, as long as they take the Clintons with them. Hillary recently went out of her way to endorse the Export-Import Bank, a little-known government agency that guarantees loans so that American corporations can sell products overseas. While secretary of state she shilled for the Ex-Im Bank. In 2009, she appeared in Moscow with officials of the Russian airline Rosavia to tout its pursuit of Ex-Im funding. This is how she put it: â€œThis is a shameless pitch for Rosavia â€” Iâ€™ve said what you wanted me to say, Sergey â€” to buy Boeing aircraft. Right? The Ex-Im Bank would welcome an application for financing from Rosavia to support its purchase of Boeing aircraft, and I hope that on a future visit Iâ€™ll see lot of new Rosavia-Boeing planes when I land in Moscow.â€? Whoring for the Ex-Im Bank in Russia on Boeings behalf (after Boeing donated millions to the Clinton Foundation). The sleeze just oozes out of her every orifice. I need to take a shower after just thinking about how sordid this is. Wed, 05/27/2015 - 23:28 | 6138825 Stackers I dont have a problem with Ex-Im bank as longs the "loans" are repaid. Does anyone know what the Non-Performing Loan ratio is for the Ex-Im bank ? Make sure that the management gets their asses out of America as well. No hangin' around Chicago, pimpin' for bucks for blow. Management ranks right up there with the politicians for their ability to screw American workers while making puffy nests for themselves. Thu, 05/28/2015 - 01:28 | 6138987 prmths2 @Stackers: Thanks for the link. Page 12 shows defaults at $176 million for FY2013; however, it appears that the overall performance hasn't been that bad, the real problem is the continued exposure of the taxpayer to risk: Thu, 05/28/2015 - 02:38 | 6139050 zhandax Look in 'Notes to the Financial Statements', page 18.  'Outstanding Defaulted Loans':  $1.3289 billion, FY2013.  I think that $176mm is how much their lawyers spent on hookers and blow to not worry about it.

In Amsterdam, you can board a plane with no identification whatsoever with a bomb in your boxers. Wed, 05/27/2015 - 23:12 | 6138788 JuliaS UK is similar or worse from personal experience. In other countries it depends. Went through the Czech republic during a terrorist scare. The Prague airport that was typically quiet had MP5 equipped guards with german shepherds. Thu, 05/28/2015 - 00:00 | 6138880 cheech_wizard Back many years ago, when being flown back to the states from the airport in Rome, all indeed looked very peaceful in the terminal. That was until you cast an eye upwards to notice the Italian military walking on catwalks carrying what appeared to be uzis. Now that Space X has been approved to boost all but the largest DoD / NRO payloads into orbit, United Launch Alliance (a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin) suddently has serious competition. The loss of revenue they are expected to incur over the next few years could be significant. Next, there is SIGNIFICANT pushback in Congress of ULA's reliance on the Russian RD-180 engines for launch operations. Each engine cost a cool $10 million. Considering the ongoing tensions with Russia, this leaves ULA / DoD / NRO / NASA in a bit of a pickle. Further, as the global economy continues to slide, this all but assures that there will be fewer orders for commercial aircraft. Wed, 05/27/2015 - 22:41 | 6138638 Paveway IV Is that a rhetorical question or a joke? Boeing and Israel go way back . Wichita and Long Beach manufacturing jobs already went to Israel and were then outsourced by them to some other shithole. Soon: St. Louis manufacturing jobs will be 'exported' and next: Chicago HQ jobs. Mention this at Boeing and your career is instantly over. Boeing probably already has the land picked out in Haifa. Ex-Im and tax breaks are noise. Boeing is headed to tax-free (for them) and arms-export psychopaths' paradise: Israel. There will be laws passed in congress that force us to buy their Israeli-manufactured crap for the next thousand years. Israel is just as interested (if not more) in all the defense electronics crap as they are the aircraft manufacturing. They'll always keep some token manufacturing here - mostly the big lines that are too hard/to expensive to move. But anything that they can unbolt and put in a crate to Haifa or some other third-world shithole subcontractor is - for all practical purposes - gone. This is just the theatre for the HQ move. You didn't think those dual-citizens in congress were there just to give away money and arms to Israel, did you? They want the whole industry. They want to make sure the major arms manufacturers look nowhere else BESIDES Israel for their new tax avoidance homes. Congress HAS to preserve Ex-Im for their business/profits wherever they skulk off too. Congresses' job is to preserve Ex-Im WHILE Boeing is secretly bailing out of the U.S. piece-by-piece. Congress is also expected to fight anything (like the Boycott-Divest-Sanction Israel movements) to make sure the 'new' Boeing isn't hurt financially by their association with Israel.  Wed, 05/27/2015 - 22:22 | 6138640 rubiconsolutions Wed, 05/27/2015 - 22:47 | 6138728 Mr. Knockout I am making a good salary from home 1500-3000/ Dollers week , which is amazing, under a year ago I was  jobless in a horrible economy.

Our government has created a corrupt and complex set of rules that business has tried to rationalize through their planning and capital expenditures, so I don't think it is unreasonable that they will resist change. The system is corrupt and if anyone, from Boeing on down, wants to financially succeed, they MUST participate in the CORRUPTION, as we ALL are. Wed, 05/27/2015 - 22:41 | 6138711 i_call_you_my_base In a free market system without a baseline the most corrupt entitity sets the bar. The upside is reinvested in defeating all others. Wed, 05/27/2015 - 22:56 | 6138760 Oldwood It seems that people fear the free market far more than corruption. On a level playing field many feel pretty vulnerable. Everyone seeks advantage to compensate what they see as their competitive weaknesses. The "little woman" with a big gun in her purse. Government is the source of power that we all rely on for protection, be it in war or in legal contracts. This power is corruptible and as such, has been corrupted. The constitution was an attempt to eliminate the source of corruption by limiting their power, but like erosion, it can be advanced or slowed but never stopped. sadly it seems that a full collapse of confidence in government is the only thing that will allow us to start again. Unfortunately, this reset will likely be very painful. Thu, 05/28/2015 - 01:31 | 6138993 Augustus The Boeing problem is that other governments supply financing for aircraft sales from their countries.  If boeing does not have the same financing assistance for buyers it will have trouble selling planes. The people posting that the loss of boeing operations in US would make no difference are full scope dumb asses.

I heard a bunch of parts were made in China.

Wed, 05/27/2015 - 22:24 | 6138632 ThroxxOfVron IF millions of other corporate welfare recipients were cut off it might result in the US being divested/cleansed of phony/parasitic enterprises wholesale. Maybe it would work with individual welfare recipients, too. True story: I found and decided to adopt a feral kitten. It took over two hours with a tub of water and a pair of tweezers to drown, pick off, and individually crush/kill almost 300 fleas on this poor little creature.    I found it a very satisfying exorcise.  The kitten was much cleaner, healthier and happier after the removal of the parasites. I postit that any organism is much cleaner, healthier and happier without hundreds of parasites feasting on and defecated all over it.   I extrapolate that our economy/society will be much cleaner, healthier and happier if a whole range of parasites, large and small, corporate and private; were denied resources, expelled and/or destroyed.
