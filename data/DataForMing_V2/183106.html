Apple Short Interest Surges: A Contrarian Indicator? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Short interest hits highest point in a year, up 54% in three updates. Slowing growth fears in China are definitely to blame. When it comes to Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), short interest is not something I talk about that often. However, the latest number shows an interesting trend. Apple short interest has surged in the past month and a half to a new yearly high,with the likely culprit are fears over slowing growth in China. Today, I'll look at the picture and detail why I think recent bets against the stock may be a little misguided. As you will see in the chart below, short interest in Apple had been pretty stagnant over the past year. Other than a few exceptions, the value was between 60 million and 70 million shares at each of the bi-monthly updates from Nasdaq. However, we've seen two straight updates with increases of nearly 14 million shares, putting us well outside the recent range. (Source: Nasdaq Apple short interest page) At the mid-September update, more than 92.6 million shares were short. This is the highest point since the end of October 2014, but you might have to go a few updates further back to get a comparable value when you consider some items. First, the supply of Apple shares is down a couple of percent thanks to Apple's buyback. When Apple reports fiscal Q4 results next month, the company is likely to report a decline of 200 million shares (or more) in its outstanding share count over the past year. Apple shares also are 15% above where they were this time last year, making it more expensive to short. The value of total shares short is almost $11 billion. Apple shares are down 14.5% from their 52-week high. Despite an e-mail to Jim Cramer from CEO Tim Cook, many believe that slowing growth in China will hurt Apple's sales there, especially when it comes to the iPhone. In late August, Apple shares fell as low as $92, down nearly a third from their yearly high, as global markets fell thanks to China worries. Mainly in regards to Apple, the following data points from Gartner on smartphone growth were troubling: This was the first year over year decline. Gartner believes that China's smartphone market has reached saturation, where there are way less first time buyers and the market is driven by replacement buyers. Apple's December-ending period will most likely show a troubling China growth number thanks to a key change regarding this year's iPhone 6S and 6S Plus launch. Apple management believes that China will eventually be the company's largest market. Currently, the company is on an aggressive expansion plan, more than doubling its retail store count in China to 40 by the middle of 2016. I think the key takeaways surround the timing of the jump are not just in relation to China. The mid-September report from Nasdaq is a data point that was a few days after the launch of the 6S/6S Plus. This showed that investors either weren't truly satisfied with the launch or at least not enough to overcome a huge jump in short interest during early September (perhaps over 100 million shares at one point). The other item is that from the middle of August to the middle of September, Apple shares were basically flat, with a drop followed by recovery. This probably means that there were a lot of bets taken against the stock at $115 or below, well off their highs. It's logical if short interest jumps higher when Apple shares are near their highs, but to happen $20 or more lower tells you that some investors think there could be even more downside ahead. We haven't seen a move in Apple short interest like this since early 2014. That was when shares fell after a disappointing earnings report and management stepped in with over $10 billion in share repurchases. Taking a look at the chart below, that period was the last major bottom for Apple shares. If Apple details a large buyback on the recent fall and fully dismisses these China worries in the coming months, perhaps $92 will prove to be the next major low. (Source: Yahoo Finance - red line is mine to show last time we saw a sustained move in short interest like this) The investor takeaway - a contrarian indicator? Since I'm still fairly bullish on Apple, I think long-term investors might want to look at this as a repeat of 2014. With China worries piling up, those with a short-term focus may have rushed out to short the name. While some launches at the September 9th event may not have thrilled everyone, there are a couple of key items to remember going forward: As some analysts have pointed out , Apple's upgrade program may reduce the length of the replacement cycle for the iPhone. Instead of waiting two years for a new phone, consumers may be able to purchase one every year, which could lead to a lot of future upside for iPhone unit sales. Apple Pay is getting closer to being launched in China. With the company believing China will be its largest market, the addition of this service could ease some revenue fears going forward. Overall, I believe this rise in short interest will be short lived. Early reviews of the iPhone 6S/6S Plus have been very positive and analysts are forecasting almost no earnings growth for fiscal 2016 ex-buyback. If the iPhone shows just a few percentage points of growth, Apple will smash revenue and earnings estimates. Despite global smartphone growth concerns, Apple is still increasing market share and controls almost all of the sector's profits. The company also will continue to produce a tremendous amount of cash, fueling a substantial buyback and dividend raise during 2016. I actually think the rise in short interest right now is a good thing for long-term investors because it means there will be a lot of shorts scrambling to cover when Apple delivers strong results.
