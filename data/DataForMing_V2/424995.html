Apple Bull Market: A Never Ending Story? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple remains on a long-term upward trend. I see some problems on the price chart and yet no serious warning signs of a trend reversal. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is one of the most important companies in the world, and is being followed by everyone. As a technical analyst, I always consider that all available information is discounted in the price. While the company has millions of investors, large or small, its price includes all types of information - fundamental, psychological, strategic, political, international, etc. Thus, my working tool will be the price chart and the study of its evolution. My aim will be to identify the current trend and detect any signs of reversal. Starting from the past and analyzing the present price situation, everything will be examined from a long-term perspective. The first step is to define the trend. The 12-year weekly chart above shows a very long uptrend with no signs of reversal. Over all these years until today the 50-day EMA has been above the 200-day EMA. Prices also have stayed above the 50-day EMA except on three occasions: in late 2008-early 2009, in the first half of 2013, and since August 2015 until today (with some exceptions with no relevance). In any case, the 200-day EMA has supported well enough Apple's price - only showing some problems in 2008-2009. Still, this is perfectly acceptable as the period mentioned is related to a profound crisis in the markets and the economy. Now, I'll look closely to the trend strength. Studying the chart above we can see that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has indicated that the price has shown strength with its records mainly between 40 and 90, in accordance with its long-term uptrend situation. It should be noted that, on the weekly chart, the RSI has reached extreme values without implying any trend reversal. Overbought conditions have only signaled strength. However, since August 2015 this indicator has often been below 40, implying a higher level of attention, but still with no serious warning signs of a trend reversal. Indeed, the 200-day EMA is so far supporting prices without real problems and the RSI never went below 30. I will also monitor carefully other long-term indicator - the 100-day Force Index. This indicator uses the three elements related to price - direction, extent and volume - to assess the strength of price movements. In recent months, we have found negative values for this indicator although without an extension that may be considered problematic. Admittedly, the trading volume has been falling consistently, but these signs do not imply immediately that a trend change is coming soon. For now, the obvious conclusion I must draw is that there has been significant selling pressure in recent times. What it's not a good sign and needs to be carefully analyzed day after day. 2016 has been complicated for Apple and this 18-month daily chart above only shows in more detail that prices have been below the two moving averages that we have been using. Furthermore, the 50-day EMA is below the 200-day EMA. To confirm all this, the 125-day Rate-of-Change indicator is negative which is an indication that the underlying trend is down. I will look carefully in the future for the values this indicator is presenting. Nonetheless, all this has to be seen in a longer term perspective and not on a daily basis. Therefore, this chart does not scare me yet as what needs to be done is a daily monitoring because the situation can deteriorate sharply. In technical terms, I still have no basis to confirm this concern. It is necessary to keep track of the evolution of prices and indicators mentioned above. 1. Apple is still on a long-term uptrend; 2. On the long-term weekly charts its stock price is above the 200-day Exponential Moving Average; 3. On the long-term weekly charts the 50-day EMA is above the 200-day EMA; 4. The RSI indicator is not oversold. B. Warning signs of possible reversal of the current upward trend: 1. On the long-term weekly charts, if the price is below these two moving averages without being able to climb; 2. On the long-term weekly charts, if the 50-day EMA is below the 200-day EMA on a sustained basis; 3. If the RSI indicator is below 30. 4ยบ Prices should exceed $105 over the coming weeks, the likely level of the 200-day EMA assuming prices will recover. 5ยบ Conversely, if prices remain weak and fall below $90 for a significant time the long-term uptrend may be in serious problems.
