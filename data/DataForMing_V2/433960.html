LA PAZ The Bolivian government rejected on Wednesday a donation of hens offered by U.S. billionaire Bill Gates, as officials said the tech magnate needs to study up on the Andean nation's thriving poultry sector.

Bolivia produces 197 million chickens annually and has the capacity to export 36 million, the local poultry producing association said.
