Corporate social responsibility (CSR) means different things to different people. From a company's perspective, it can be an effective way to tap corporate resources to drive positive social change, and it often includes programs that promote employee volunteerism and philanthropy—from matching charitable donations to organizing employee volunteer projects and more. While some people view CSR programs with skepticism, most prefer working for and doing business with companies that support the communities in which they operate. What does corporate social responsibility mean to you? Do you believe it can be impactful?

This week, our Ask the Readers giveaway is sponsored by Charles Schwab in celebration of Schwab Volunteer Week! “Serving our communities is an important part of Schwab’s culture. In fact, one of our benefits is paid time off for employees to volunteer. We also organize a nationwide, week-long volunteer event called Schwab Volunteer Week (May 18-22, 2015), where thousands of employees volunteer with nonprofits in their communities. This year’s event has a record number of participants, with more than 4,600 Schwabbies donating approximately 18,000 service hours to 376 projects benefiting over 200 charities. We support a vibrant mix of national nonprofit groups such as Boys & Girls Clubs, Habitat for Humanity, Goodwill and The Salvation Army, as well as local schools, parks, food banks, cultural centers, and organizations that provide health and human services to women, children, families and seniors. Employee volunteer photos will be posted throughout the week on http://photos.aboutschwab.com/Schwab-Volunteer-Week/Schwab-Volunteer-Week-2015 .

Corporate responsibility is great because it boosts the company's PR efforts and it makes employees feel good about helping others.  I think blood drives and canned food drives are really easy ways to help. To provide a useful service or product that improves lives and, therefore society. To provide productive and meaningful employment. To do no harm to customers and/or employees. I think all companies should be giving back to the communities they reside in - in some way.  It may be as simple as offering to donate money annual to a charity of the corporations choice, or even as deep as involving employees within an event, such as a run to help raise awareness (perhaps the susan g komen events). Corporate social responsibility means taking care of your employees and giving back to the local community. Paying employees a living wage and providing them with full benefits. Encouraging employees to volunteer and matching charitable donations. It also means caring about and being part of the community you're in to make it a better place. Corporate Social Responsibility means that a company uses their money, power, and reputation for good and not for evil--both in the U.S. and overseas. To not take advantage of those who are less than you. Disclaimer: The links and mentions on this site may be affiliate links.
