Looking For Bonds? Think Twice About These Apples - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple issued another slew of bonds today, allowing it to lock in low rates and tight spreads, all in support of its shareholder capital return program. While one might argue that from an institutional standpoint these bonds offer value, individual investors might want to be wary of the longer dated bonds. The last two articles related to debt that I posted here on Seeking Alpha focused on what is, essentially, the anti-Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) from a profitability point of view: Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ). One article looked at Tesla converts, and the other article went through the hypothetical exercise of pricing a Telsa 7-year bond. Apple debt, on the other hand, is hardly the stuff of theory - these guys issue bonds faster than your daughter can drop your new iPhone into a sink while freaking out because you won't let her download an app that lets her frost electronic muffins. And so it is that Apple placed another $8 billion in debt Thursday which (and I appreciate that I may be biased thanks to the fact that I spent a couple decades selling bonds for a living) is an incredibly obvious, incredibly good strategy for them. This doesn't mean people won't fret about it - there was some hand-wringing in the press when Apple came to market in February that there might be some kind of "debt craze" infecting the tech sector. I do like the visual: I see sweaty guys in black and white, with filterless cigarettes drooping from their mouths, shouting into telephone receivers, "Tim wants more debt, you hear me? More debt!" Here's the thing: there is a craze, in a sense, but it's working the other way: big companies don't necessarily want to issue bonds as a matter of course, it's just that the current rate and spread environment is so ridiculously generous, borrowing money is as close to free as it has been since anyone bothered collecting data. Basically, bond buyers are forcing them to sell bonds because they're offering such aggressive terms. Interestingly, there's an article up that basically walks through the pro case for buying these new issues: they're at a concession to existing Apple bonds, they're cheap to the interpolated Apple credit curve as well as peer credits, etc. And this is the kind of thing bond salespeople spent all morning arguing on the phone with the folks at pension funds and insurance companies about, and it looks pretty accurate to me (I encourage people to read it ). But for us mortals, let's think this one through a little more carefully, especially as we think about the "value" of the longer-term bonds. Thanks to the financial crisis of 2008, central banks everywhere panicked about the lack of liquidity in the marketplace and drove rates to zero, and more or less left them there. This kind of effort to drive rates lower is generally most effective in the front end of the Treasury curve. If we were to go back and look at the history of, say, the two-year Treasury bond during the crisis until now we'd see this: Makes sense: midway through 2008 we had a genuine catastrophe on our hands (human sacrifice, dogs and cats living together... mass hysteria) and the Feds were doing everything they could to keep the financial sector liquid. Mix in a flight to quality as people buy up US Treasuries, and rates more or less plunge, hit bottom, and bump along. But remember, this is just a two-year bond. The longest you're going to be mixed up with it is... two years, and then you get your money back, and you can think things over anew. Maybe the only reason you own it is because some other investment broke your heart, and this is the rebound. It's solely there for a good time. Sure, you can get involved with the two-year, but implicit in your relationship is that you will be seeing other securities. Now, the 30-year is its own special beast, because this bond demands a commitment: you're marrying this thing and having kids. One needs to think about all kinds of things, serious things, when they buy a 30-year bond. We need to worry about the macroeconomic stuff that maybe you didn't quite get to in the textbook, the stuff about commodity pricing and international trade balances and currency valuation and money supply and I don't even know what else, because I didn't get to that part of the book either. The 30-year does its own thing, and if you don't respect that, it can hurt you. Just look at that price action - these are 20 and 30 point swings. Hey, it's a 4.5% bond! No, it's a 2.5% bond! Now it's a 4.5% bond again! Back down to 3.5%, and someone call an ambulance because our long rates trader is mumbling to himself in Esperanto, hiding in the third stall in the men's room and only responding to the name "Truffles." But there's a bigger point I am getting to here, and this is why whatever they are paying the CFO over at Apple, it just isn't enough. I could only go back as far as 1980, so you'll have to take it on faith that in modernity, long US rates have basically NEVER been as low as they are right now: Zoiks! Just say the numbers out loud, if only to remind yourself that it is simply not normal for long rates to be this low. Highs of over 15%, an average of almost 7%. And at only one time in postwar history have rates been this low, and that time is: now. So, if you buy a 30-year bond from Apple today, they have issued into a multi-decade low in rates, as well as a multi-decade tight in credit spreads, and you the investor are hoping for… what? I guess you get your money back in 2045, so that's a plus, and you get your running 4.375% coupon, but if anything ever happens to take rates up off these lows, or credit spreads themselves decide to back up, the vicious truth of the math on a 30-year bond is that you will feel pain. If the bond simply backs up to 5%, you're down ten points (well, to be precise, the bond price would be $90.341). If yields revert to some kind of historical mean, and maybe these bonds trade to just 6% and you want to sell, you can look forward to trading them at $77.50. Being out 23% on a "riskless" bond isn't great math. To be clear, Apple is not your enemy in a trade like this. But everything else is, and you're going to live in fear of inflation for the next 30 years. Can you buy these and hold if all you need is 4.375% per year and be happy, knowing that you will (in all likelihood) get your money back. And maybe rates go even lower, or stay low for a really long time, and in the next three decades nothing really odd happens with the global economy, or inflation, or all of the other stuff people with beards seem to fixate on. But really what Apple (and every other big issuer out there) is telling you is this: debt capital is cheap, so cheap they can't stop themselves from wallpapering the Street with bonds. And good for them, but it doesn't hurt to be mindful of what it could mean to have your money locked up in a bond like that over the long haul. I'm not here to condone irresponsible behavior (I save that for happy hour, when as a rule I absolutely condone irresponsible behavior) but being just a little bit glib, the take-away is that, if anything, investors should either be agitating to see this happen more often, and perhaps mimicking these good companies who spend all day long thinking about how to best source and deploy capital, given its cost. So go ahead, get a 30-year mortgage, and buy a bunch of Apple stock with it. It's more or less what Tim Cook is doing, and in this environment, it strikes me as a very sharp trade.
