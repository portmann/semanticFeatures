Apple: New Upgrade Program Key To iPhone 6s, 6s Plus Release - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple introduced the new iPhone 6s & 6s Plus on Wednesday. Interestingly, the press release included details on an upgrade program. In the near-term, US revenues may see a dip and costs will increase, depending on the adoption rate. The upgrade program is yet another step (and one that I applaud) by Apple to keep its customers in its ecosystem. On Wednesday, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) introduced the new iPhone 6s & 6s Plus. The press release included an interesting section regarding an upgrade program. Although it may seem like Apple is simply copying carriers, it is in fact differentiating itself (I explain below). In the near-term, I expect US revenues to see a dip and costs to increase - the magnitude would depend largely on the adoption rate. Apple's new upgrade program is yet another step by the company to keep its customers in its ecosystem. Here are the relevant details from Apple's official press release : iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus will be available in gold, silver, space gray and the new rose gold metallic finishes for $0 down with 24 monthly payments starting at $27 (US) and $31 (US), respectively, from Apple's retail stores in the US, Apple.com, select carriers and Apple Authorized Resellers. Exclusively at Apple's retail stores in the US, customers can choose their carrier and get an unlocked iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus with the opportunity to get a new iPhone annually and AppleCare+ on the new iPhone Upgrade Program with monthly payments starting at $32 (US) and $37 (US), respectively. As to why Apple is introducing an upgrade program, I am of the opinion that this is a response to the recent drift away from carrier subsidies which slow the rate at which customers purchase new phones (due to higher pricing as a result of reduced/no subsidies). By introducing a competitively-priced (discussed below) upgrade program, Apple not only gets to cut out the middleman (carriers), but stems the slowdown in the phone upgrade cycle. Considering the fact that Apple is overcapitalized and that major carriers are modestly-to-aggressively levered, it is unlikely that Apple would need to reduce pricing further. In the near-term, carriers would have to match Apple's pricing. Although price-matching would hurt their revenues, it is a necessary evil while carriers ponder their next move. However, I don't think the carriers can do much but revert to the old subsidy model given that Apple certainly has the financial firepower to price aggressively while carriers do not exactly have that luxury (given their debt loads). Over the long-term, it is likely that customers will purchase their iPhones direct from Apple. Carriers would have to contend with merely providing data plans. In a nutshell, this is how the program works: Buyers pay Apple a monthly fee (effectively a two-year loan) and get an unlocked iPhone (activation with your preferred carrier) in return. Notably, the deal comes with AppleCare+ and allows customers to get a new iPhone annually. If we compare this to the typical carrier model where customers are locked into a two-year contract, Apple's proposition appears significantly better. The main reason why I think adoption is likely to be rapid is simple. By utilizing this upgrade program consumers get to upgrade their iPhones annually (as new models are released), whereas if a consumer opts for a typical two-year contract with a carrier, upgrade cycles would take far longer than a year. Besides, spending ~$32/mth is much easier than forking out ~$600. Additionally, if we run the math, it seems that it is actually cheaper to go the Apple route as seen below (AT&T (NYSE: T ) is used for comparison), according to Zdnet . In addition, opting for Apple instead of a carrier also comes with AppleCare+. In sum, the upgrade program offers consumers three main benefits: Allows the customer to upgrade annually. I believe the above is a more compelling value proposition to customers compared to what carriers are offering, so I think it is likely that adoption will be quick. In the near-term, US revenues may see a dip while costs will rise, depending on the adoption rate Notably, Apple is only making the program available within the US (per the press release, a consumer would require a US credit card). Therefore, the impact on operations will be limited to its US segment until Apple rolls out the program globally. Given GAAP accounting principles, it is likely that Apple will recognize revenue over the length of the loan while expensing the full cost of the sale at the time of purchase. Ergo, if adoption is rapid, US revenues may see a dip while costs will rise. However, if this is purely a result of the new upgrade program (hopefully some detail on adoption rates would be provided on the next conference call), investors should not be concerned given that such a model would inherently result in the above scenario. Apple will simply be pushing revenues out to the next few quarters while recognizing costs upfront. A common concern that analysts (and investors) raise regarding Apple is that the company operates a business model where it is very difficult to forecast future performance (fellow SA contributor Neil Cybart summed up this issue nicely in his recent Apple article ). Apple is not a Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ ) where investors can be reasonably assured that customers will continue buying the company's products for decades to come. Instead, Apple's future performance is inherently tied to new product launches - the success of which is difficult to determine ex-ante. I believe that this is one reason why Apple is being valued at such a material discount to the broader market. That being said, if adoption of the new upgrade program is widespread, this will result in heightened revenue visibility (as one can simply look at whether accounts receivable is growing y/y) and should offer the Street more comfort regarding Apple's future performance. With visibility increased, the market should in turn reward Apple with a higher valuation multiple. Finally, heightened revenue visibility should also be music to the ears of a DGI (Dividend Growth Investor). DGIs are mainly concerned (and rightfully so) with the ability of a company to grow its dividend. While Apple should not experience any near-term concerns regarding growing its cash distribution (given its current large cash hoard), increased visibility into future performance is likely to offer DGIs higher levels of comfort nonetheless. The upgrade program is yet another step (and one that I applaud) by Apple to keep its customers within its ecosystem It is no secret that a majority (if not all) of the moves that Apple is making has the ultimate objective of keeping its customers within its ecosystem (I elaborate extensively on this in my prior Apple article ). The upgrade program is yet another example of such a move. If the upgrade program turns out to be a success, Apple certainly looks inexpensive at current levels (even more so in light of the recent pullback). The iPhone is the root of Apple's ecosystem - as long as the user base is maintained, investors can reasonably be assured that Apple's ancillary products (iTunes, App Store, Apple Pay, etc) would remain healthy as well. Apart from aiding Apple in maintaining/growing its user base, it also offers the company higher visibility into future performance, which should placate the Street's fears of the sustainability of the company's business model and become more attractive in the eyes of a DGI looking to invest for the long-term.
