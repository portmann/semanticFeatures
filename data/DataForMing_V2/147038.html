Facebook: Raising My Price Target To $110 - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha A couple of weeks ago, Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) reported its second quarter results . The company announced another impressive quarter, beating on both the top and bottom lines. With other names in the space struggling, Facebook remains my preferred investment in social media. In this article, I raise my price target to $110, and detail why the recent pullback could be a reason to buy. In Q2, Facebook broke the $4 billion revenue mark, and actually grew its monthly active user base (year over year) faster than Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ). While Facebook's GAAP net income is down this year based on increased business investments, the company still had a GAAP profit of $1.23 billion in the first half of 2015. You won't find that with any other social media name. Non-GAAP net income was up more than 28% in the first half of the year. One of the key highlights I saw was the following comment from CFO Dave Wehner: Wehner also stated Facebook is narrowing its 2015 GAAP cost/expense growth guidance to 55%-60% from 55%-65%. Also, the 2015 capex budget has been cut by $200M to $2.5B-$3B (still up from $1.8B last year). Back when this year started, I discussed how earnings hopes for Facebook this year were low as the company was forecasting a "significant expense" year. Just as investors have recently cheered Google's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) spending discipline, I like how Facebook has reduced its spending forecast. In fact, in that linked article above, I stated that "If investors want to see this stock hit triple digits in 2015, I think Facebook really needs to top $2.00 in non-GAAP EPS." Given the recent quarterly result and new forecast, we've seen analyst estimates rise to new highs for this year, as seen in the table below. Twitter continues to blow through hundreds of millions of dollars, while Facebook has actual profits. Facebook also reported free cash flow of more than $1 billion in Q2, leaving the company with over $14 billion in cash at the end of the quarter. The company's strong balance sheet will allow the company to further invest in itself, whether it be investments in current businesses or more acquisitions. The company isn't just increasing its user base, as it is also greatly increasing its user monetization. As detailed on page 25 of the recent 10-Q filing , average revenues per user were $2.76 in Q2, up from $2.24 in the year ago period. This was led by strong growth in the US and Canada, where ARPU increased from $6.44 to $9.30. If I were an advertiser currently, I'd be going to Facebook to get the most bang for my buck. Twitter is struggling to grow its user base and needs to find a new CEO. Facebook has roughly 1.5 billion monthly active users, while Twitter has just over 300 million. Facebook is expected to increase revenues by another 35% next year, and non-GAAP EPS are expected to jump to $2.75. With Twitter still struggling and LinkedIn (NYSE: LNKD ) falling after so-so guidance , I just see more money flowing into Facebook currently. With things looking better than expected, I've decided to revise my valuation model. To do this, let's look at the 2016 non-GAAP P/Es for the social media names and Google currently, based on analyst estimates for each. Twitter and LinkedIn trade for giant premiums to Facebook, despite each of them having some issues. Because Facebook is so large, some see it deserving a lower multiple, because growth will be harder to come by. If you average the future P/Es of Twitter, LinkedIn, and Google, you are a little over 40 times non-GAAP EPS. If Facebook can achieve that $2.75 EPS figure next year currently expected by analysts, I think that 40 figure is very reasonable. That equals a $110 stock, which is decent upside from current levels. Facebook reported another solid quarter, and like Google, the company detailed some expense discipline this year. With estimates rising to new highs, I've raised my price target to $110 on the name, based on strong earnings growth next year. Given the fact that peers trade for higher multiples with worse businesses, I think my valuation is quite reasonable. As seen in the chart below, Facebook shares have almost pulled back to their 50-day moving average, which should provide some short-term support for the stock.
