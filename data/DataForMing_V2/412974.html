Apple: Google's Project Ara Shows That iPhone Got It Right - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Google's Project Ara promised the ability to mix and match module components to build a customized smartphone. Ara represents an inappropriate application of PC concepts and will probably never reach consumers. Project Ara is Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) development project for a "modular" smartphone that promised expandability and upgradeability. In its latest incarnation, announced at Google IO, Ara backs off considerably from those promises. In fact, Ara highlights the wisdom of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) in going the opposite direction with iPhone. Ara also underscores Apple's unique advantage in controlling the design of both its hardware and software. Ara is a project in Google's Advanced Technology and Projects (ATAP) group, which had its origins in Motorola and was kept after Motorola was sold to Lenovo ( OTCPK:LNVGY ). Starting in 2013, Ara was developed by Paul Eremenko, who had worked at DARPA as had the manager of ATAP, Regina Dugan. In the initial concepts, Ara smartphone would consist of a frame with a data bus to connect various modules. The modules could include processors, batteries, cameras, etc. Modules were easily removable and the user could mix or match to customize the phone. It's a cool concept, but just looking at the picture, the reader can probably spot some obvious shortcomings. Ara is bulky, and that's necessitated by not only the frame, but also the modules, which are fully enclosed. This means that Ara caries around a lot of excess packaging, bulk and weight. There's also an underlying technical challenge. Having all modules share a common data bus, even the very high speed bus (10 Gbit/sec) of Ara isn't necessarily optimal. Modern smartphone SOCs, such as those designed by Apple, use multiple data buses to interface to high data rate devices such as RAM, flash storage, cameras and display screens. Maintaining separate dedicated interfaces for these "peripherals" seems to be the right answer. At least, it's the answer that has been universally adopted in the industry. The challenges of making the shared bus work apparently led to a major re-architecting of Ara as announced this year at Google IO . In the latest version, base components such as the SOC, battery, position sensors and the display will all be integrated into the frame. The data bus will only be used for accessories such as cameras and speakers. In Ara was expressed a longing for the PC paradigm of standard expansion interfaces (like PCIe), a vast hardware ecosystem of add-on devices, and the ability to customize and upgrade the computing device. Along with the promises of the PC paradigm came all the downside: difficulty in developing drivers for the disparate hardware and basic reliability issues. When a device was shown at Google IO 2014 , it failed to boot. Having embraced so many aspects of the commodity PC business model in Android, the appeal of ARA was an understandable extension. It was, however, completely inappropriate for the mobile device market, where the premium is on compactness, durability and reliability. From the beginning, Apple understood what would be important in a smartphone. Prior to iPhone, Apple had a business model in search of a product. Apple's business model for computing devices was to control the operating system and hardware design, thereby assuring (presumably) the best user experience. Applied to personal computers, the model was only partly successful. Apple commanded a small but loyal following who saw value in Apple's approach, but for most computers, the commodity model was sufficient. In smartphones, Apple found the perfect application of its business model. Consumers weren't terribly interested in tinkering with their smartphones. The physical size of the devices limited the interfaces that could be used, mostly USB derived ports and flash card readers. Consumers, upgrading mostly from feature phones when iPhone was introduced in 2007, did have very high expectations for reliability. "It just works" became the mantra of iPhone marketing. But iPhone was light years ahead of other smartphones at the time, presenting the user with what amounted to a miniature PC. For many, the experience of a PC that "just worked" was new. The reliability of the iPhone has been part and parcel to its ability to command a premium price and its 94% share of the smartphone industry profits . It was Apple's control of its operating system, application software and hardware design that enabled that reliability. Apple is the only smartphone maker that does develop both its operating system and its hardware (down to the processor design). I often get asked, "Why is that an advantage?" The best answer I can give is an engineering answer that may not satisfy non-technical readers. Integrating hardware and software is hard. Back when I was working in aerospace, system integration (bringing together software and hardware) was always the most difficult phase of a program. Having control of hardware and software as Apple does both makes that process easier, and assures a better quality outcome. Even now, iOS is much more reliable , and iOS apps crash less frequently than Android. Control of hardware and software also has allowed Apple to introduce apps and functionality that iOS users take for granted every day. iCloud, iMessage and Facetime are just some examples. Given the problems Android still has with reliability and fragmentation, I doubt Google will ever take the risk of unleashing Ara on an unsuspecting world. It represents a paradigm for which there's probably no market in mobile devices. And it would be a Pandora's Box of reliability problems. Is it any wonder that Paul Eremenko has left Google and Ara behind to start a new research lab for Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSF )? Investors should still be concerned that Apple is not sufficiently leveraging its advantage in hardware/software integration. Apple needs to do a better job of educating the general public about its innovations in both hardware (especially SOCs) and software. I get so tired of hearing that Apple is no longer innovative. There's also the problem that the greater reliability of Apple products afforded by its systems integration expertise isn't readily apparent at the store counter. Apple needs to bring forward more cutting edge features that consumers can see in-store. Apple's iOS split screen feature should have been on iPhone since the 6s was introduced. As I have pointed out, and Google IO has confirmed , this feature will soon be available on new Android phones. I'm cautiously optimistic that we'll see more innovation in iPhone 7 than is expected by Apple bears. I remain long Apple and recommend it as a buy for investors with a 3-5 year investment timeframe.
