The Monetization Of WhatsApp Will Catalyze Facebook's Stock - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha WhatsApp has a great potential for monetization over the long term. Facebook will likely find effective ways to monetize WhatsApp. Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) took a lot of criticism when it purchased WhatsApp for $19 billion last year. Obviously, the current $1 per year subscription for the app will not provide a good return on investment. However, I think that WhatsApp will prove to be a wise investment over the long term for Facebook, as the company finds an effective way to generate more revenue from it. I also think that Facebook's stock will make significant moves higher when the monetization plan is implemented. Although it is not yet clear how Facebook plans on monetizing WhatsApp, there are a few strategies that could work. Ads could work if they are not overdone. For example, the 1st message at the top of the WhatsApp screen could be used for ads, similar to the way Yahoo! (NASDAQ: YHOO ) places ads that appear to be new email messages at the top of users' email pages. Or the company could randomly place ads in between messages, similar to the way they appear in Facebook news feed. Consumers are used to ads on most websites, so if done properly, these options could be effective. After all, Facebook did effectively monetize the website bearing the company's name and the company is highly profitable as a result. However, if users perceive ads to be intrusive on WhatsApp, then it could cause some users to use another app. Ads may not be the direction that Facebook wants to take for WhatsApp monetization. As an alternative, Facebook could implement fees similar to how Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Skype does . Skype charges fees for making calls or texting to mobile or landline phones. Skype earns revenue of about $2 billion annually with 300 million users . So, we can see with a simple quantitative analysis that WhatsApp's 800 million MAUs (monthly active users) could translate into about $5 billion of annual revenue for Facebook if a similar monetization strategy was implemented. This would pay off Facebook's investment in WhatsApp in four years. This could be the path that Facebook takes if the company determines that ads would be too intrusive. Facebook could also implement both ads and charge fees for certain services. This would provide Facebook with multiple sources of revenue from WhatsApp. However, I doubt that the company would implement both simultaneously. That would probably be too much change all at once for WhatsApp's users and cause a negative perception for the app. The Facebook team is expert at processing and analyzing user data and using it for advertisers to implement targeted marketing strategies. So, I think it is likely that the company will be successful in leveraging and applying that strength to WhatsApp in some form. Currently, Facebook expressed that it is more interested in growing the WhatsApp user base over rushing to monetize it. So, by building up the users, which is likely to exceed 1 billion MAUs possibly as early as the first half of 2016, WhatsApp will have a significant amount of users for monetization. WhatsApp added 200 million new users over the past 8 months, so if it can add another 200 million over the next 8 months, the 1 billion mark will be exceeded in Q1 2016. I am confident that with Facebook's expertise in processing user data, that the company will be successful in monetizing WhatsApp and making it a significant long-term source of income. Although it is not clear exactly when the monetization of WhatsApp will take place, I would estimate that it will take place within the next 5 years, perhaps as early as next year. So, investors can think of WhatsApp as a strong potential revenue producer in Facebook's pipeline, similar to how a potential blockbuster drug may look in a biotech's pipeline. Blockbusters produce at least $1 billion in revenue for biotech companies. I would expect WhatsApp to produce significantly more than $1 billion in revenue per year for Facebook. The company could most likely make $5 billion per year just by implementing a Skype-style fee for services as I mentioned earlier. That is like having 5 blockbuster drugs in the pipeline. I know that there has been a debate on whether Facebook is overvalued or not. Some balk at the trailing PE of 78 or the forward PE of 30.8 without taking a longer-term approach. Looking at the trailing PE is looking in the past, so I don't place much weight on that. Although the forward PE is a better measure of valuation than the trailing PE, it is limited since it only measures the current stock price against next year's earnings. Since Facebook has WhatsApp and Oculus in the pipeline for future monetization, I would rather take a longer-term view of Facebook as an investment. One quick way to evaluate Facebook's valuation for the long term is to look at its PE against its 5-year expected growth. The company's PEG of 1.5 shows that the stock is fairly valued. With the PEG at the midpoint between 1 and 2, the stock is priced reasonably for its expected 5-year annual earnings growth of 27% . To confirm Facebook's fair valuation, I performed an updated discounted cash flow analysis. Facebook was left with $3.6 billion in free cash flow (FCF) in 2014 even after spending $1.8 billion in CapEx. The company increased its FCF by 26.8% last year over 2013. The company's FCF can be used for expanding the business or for share buybacks without adding to debt - so I place a high weight on a company's ability to grow FCF. Using Facebook's WACC of 9.07% as the discount rate and estimating FCF growth of 20% for the next five years, 15% growth for years 6-10, and 3% annually thereafter, the stock has an intrinsic value of about $83. The current price is $80, so this confirms my thesis that the stock is fairly valued. With a fair valuation, Facebook's stock is likely to continue trending higher as the company's revenue and earnings continue to increase. For the near term (before WhatsApp is monetized), the stock is likely to increase approximately in line with earnings growth. Facebook is expected to increase EPS at 13% this year and 31% next year. So, I think the stock can reasonably rise about 22% annually over the next 2 years. If Facebook significantly exceeds estimates, the results could be higher. I also think that when the announcement of Facebook's plan to monetize WhatsApp takes place, that the stock will make a significant move higher. I think it is wise to own the stock before that announcement takes place. Source: The Monetization Of WhatsApp Will Catalyze Facebook's Stock Disclosure: The author is long FB.
