Apple: Ready For A Historical Pullback? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Developers Conference not kind to share price. US markets are rallying again, and that has helped Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) bounce more than 10% off its yearly low. While there was some enthusiasm after Berkshire Hathaway bought a stake in the technology giant, many still wonder what the company has in store with the iPhone 7. Next week's Worldwide Developers Conference will provide some key clues, but investors should beware the stock's underperformance during this event. About a year ago, I detailed how Apple needed to show improvement in iOS in order to make the iPhone 6s a worthwhile product. Looking back now, that didn't happen, which has cost shares $30 since the 2015 WWDC high. Last year again followed the WWDC pattern with shares declining, as seen in the table below. 2014 was an outlier, but remember that there was the Apple stock split the following week which I believe impacted performance then. Of the 14 weeks above where shares have declined during WWDC, the average down week was 3.86%. Given Apple's recent rally and US markets' near highs, we could be setting up for another decline. This year's WWDC event may show that Apple has decided to move to a three year upgrade cycle for the iPhone. If this is the case, the newest iPhone launch scheduled for September this year will probably prove to be underwhelming, given most consumers and investors were expecting a major upgrade. Apple will likely still spend much of WWDC focusing on iOS, as the recent pattern in the chart below details. (Image via Philip Elmer-DeWitt article ) Last year, Apple spent a good chunk of time focusing on WatchOS, and I think the company needs to devote more time to that this year. Recently, fellow SA contributor Seth Golden detailed how Fitbit's (NYSE: FIT ) sell through data is significantly stronger than what's being seen with Apple Watch. I would like to see a new Watch launched at WWDC, but I'm thinking Apple may wait until later this year to pair the launch with the iPhone. With Apple's wearable sales falling off as we are now more than a year from the original Watch launch, the company needs to get things going again. One interesting rumor this week is that Apple could launch the iPad Air 3 at next week's conference. I think this is a good idea because a new mid-level Apple tablet could be targeted at this year's back to school crowd. Last year's tablet refresh focused on the iPad mini, with Apple also launching the iPad Pro, so we didn't get an Air 3. A new iPad release in the coming weeks could actually help the iPad to show its first quarterly year over year unit sales increase in quite a while in the upcoming fiscal Q4 period. I recently stated that Apple needs to provide some sort of major surprise at WWDC, and I still believe that is true. If the company just details some little updates to its operating systems, we're likely to see the annual WWDC week pullback in shares. With iPhone sales declining and expectations for the iPhone 7 starting to come down, Apple needs to think big at WWDC. A new Watch or iPad would be a welcomed sight, especially since it would help stagger product launches and provide a more balanced revenue stream throughout the fiscal year.
