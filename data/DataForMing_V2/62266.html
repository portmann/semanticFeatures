Cablevision sues Verizon over claims in commercial targeting FiOS | Reuters NEW YORK May 19 Cablevision Systems Corp  sued Verizon Communications Inc on Tuesday, seeking a judge's finding that a Cablevision television commercial claiming that Verizon's FiOS service does not solely use fiber optic cable is actually truthful.

Verizon initiated the earlier proceeding on April 27 before the Council of Better Business Bureaus' National Advertising Division, the complaint said.
