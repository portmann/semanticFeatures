Cyber Monday 2015: Amazon, Target, Travelocity, Expedia, Quicken, and More â€” My Money Blog November 29, 2015 By Jonathan Ping Leave a Comment Here’s a quick roundup of the Black Friday / Cyber Monday deals that I felt either had broad appeal, were finance-related, or might ideally save you money on stuff you would have bought anyway. Amazon 10% Off. A reminder to save on their Cyber Week deals and everything else on Amazon with Chase Freedom 10% back , Discover Card (5% or 10% back with Double It Promotion), and AmEx Offers $15 off $60 .   I shop there a lot and have already loaded up on gift cards to lock in the savings. Target 15% Off. Target.com is offering 15% site-wide on 11/30 with promo code CYBER15.  Useful for things that are usually not discounted.  Stack with 5% off with their REDcard. Travelocity 17% Off. The page isn’t entirely clear, but it appears to be saying that you can get an additional 17% off any hotel booking on Cyber Monday, on top of the normal discount. Expedia $75 off $300. $75 off your first hotel booked on the Expedia App ($300 minimum purchase).  Stack with their already-discounted rates for Cyber Monday.   Hotel stay must be by March 31, 2016. SimpliSafe 20% Off. DIY Home Security system.  See my Simplisafe Review .  20% off during Black Friday weekend, which probably the biggest flat discount I’ve seen. Quicken 2016 40% Off. Get 40% off the list price of 2016 Quicken Deluxe, Premier, Home & Business, Rental Property Manager, or Quicken for Mac 2016.  Valid either at Amazon or Quicken.com .  This is one of the biggest discounts you’ll see.  Thanks to reader Brad for the tip. iBank for Mac 20% Off. Alternative money management software for Mac. 20% off through 11/30. Ting Black Friday Deals. Possibly cheaper cell phone service for some folks.  Buy a device or bring your own.  See my Ting post for details.  Good until 11/30 at 11:59 ET.
