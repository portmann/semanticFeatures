One Horizon Group: Aishuo Launches On iTunes China, 6 Million Downloads Announced - One Horizon Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:OHGI) | Seeking Alpha One Horizon Group is out with some excellent news for investors today in announcing that its Chinese-branded mobile VoIP app, Aishuo, has launched on Apple iTunes in China. Of course those following the One Horizon Group story since I initiated coverage know that this is a watershed moment of the company and for its Chinese strategy. One Horizon Group updated investors as to pre-Apple announcement downloads which now stand at a whopping 6 million in total. One Horizon Group (NASDAQ: OHGI ) is out with some excellent news for investors today in announcing that its Chinese-branded mobile VoIP app, Aishuo, has launched on Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iTunes in China and that "its subscribers can also purchase App credit using the Apple iTunes In-App Purchase platform (SOURCE: OHGI PR)". Of course those following the One Horizon Group story since I initiated coverage know that this is a watershed moment of the company and for its Chinese strategy . One Horizon Group has been clear in that its goal is to acquire 15 million Chinese Aishuo users within 24-months of launch in an effort to then monetize this user base to industry average ARPU. The company has been very successful so far in launching only on the Android platform - this means without being able to target China's top smartphone vendor, Apple. Also, One Horizon Group has been having the level of success it has had, 5.19 million Chinese downloads was the most recent figure announced prior to today's Apple iTunes announcement, while building out its Chinese payment processing and Chinese payment market place vendor base. Having a Chinese payment market place that now includes all of the major Chinese mobile payment platforms including China UnionPay, Alibaba's Alipay (NYSE: BABA ) and Tencent's Wechat Wallet ( OTCPK:TCEHY ) ( OTCPK:TCTZD ) gives users the option to purchase Aishuo credit and subscribe to a range of premium Aishuo app services. Again, prior growth rates have not included the full benefit of these developments. Now, however, One Horizon Group will have the Apple tailwind at its back along with an increasing demand for its handsets. According to IDC (via the One Horizon Group press release) Apple iPhone models 6 and 6 Plus should see accelerating demand into future quarters. Aishuo being device, app store, payment processor, and now operating system agnostic should be a huge accelerant to download rates and early ancillary monetization. Finally, One Horizon Group updated investors as to pre-Apple announcement downloads which now stand at a whopping 6 million in total. Again, these are acquired using only the 20 Chinese Android app stores and the total download figure dates back only to the late-February launch. This means that just five months into a 24-month strategy and without the tailwind of riding China's largest smartphone vendor that One Horizon Group is almost at the halfway point to goal. I remain extremely confident that the company will continue to see great success in its Chinese efforts and that it will far exceed its Chinese goal in that timeframe. Please remember that at the same time as having an acute focus on China that One Horizon Group has global downloads taking place (see: Indonesia, Philippines, etc.). Longtime followers of the One Horizon Group story know that I've been bullish since prior to the Aishuo launch and that I've closely followed the company's developments. Since I've been long the company has greatly increased its probability of success by completing key milestones on time and to a further extent than expected. I believe One Horizon Group to be well positioned to continue to provide excellent returns to investors holding the name long term.
