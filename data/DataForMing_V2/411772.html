Yahoo - Upside Potential Trumps Downside Risk - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha WSJ article needs to be taken with a grain of salt - ok maybe a whole shaker of salt. Warren Buffett's involvement is material - it matters. The Wall Street Journal's after hour's report on Yahoo's (NASDAQ: YHOO ) second round potential bids of $2-$3 billion on May 19, 2016 was a very sensational article. Fortunately for shareholders, this report was mostly smoke and mirrors and rampant speculation compared to solid journalism based on incontrovertible facts. The market realized this also as Yahoo's stock started pre-market activity Friday May 20, 2016 6% down but finished the day down only 1.4% as volume pretty much doubled from the typical daily approximation of 15 million shares traded to over 34 million shares. CNBC's David Faber hit the nail on the head calling the report "Completely wrong" saying that bids of that size would be lower than the lowest of the first round bids ( SA article ). The WSJ article even hedges its reporting saying that bids could come in higher than it reported and that bids might not be for ALL of the core business but only parts of them. It doesn't take too many $2-$3 billion dollar bids for separate parts of Yahoo's core business to add up to the $4-$8 billion dollars most analysts think Yahoo's core business is worth. Considering current second round bidders most likely include Verizon (NYSE: VZ ), buyout firm TGC, Bain Capital, Vista Equity Partners, former Yahoo CEO Ross Levinsohn, Quicken Loans's Dan Gilbert (backed by Warren Buffett), and a couple other potential players ( article ), this robust auction for separate parts or all of Yahoo has the potential to be much more lucrative than the $2-$3 billion dollars the WSJ reports. Another interesting tidbit is the dismissal of Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK.A, BRK.B) Warren Buffett's backing of a consortium of bidders including Quicken Loans' Dan Gilbert by many bears and skeptics. Their thesis usually revolves around the fact that Buffett is just backing the bid and is not actually seeking to buy part or all of Yahoo for Berkshire Hathaway. They key to understanding the value of Buffett's involvement is what it brings to the table for Yahoo. What Buffett's potential financial backing brings is simply a credible bid. With big players in the auction process, a smaller fish like Quicken Loans's Dan Gilbert would have had to drop out after the first round unless they could show credible financial backing to complete a sale if a deal was done. Warren Buffett gives this bid the credibility needed to be an active player in the second round of biddings. As with any auction, it only takes two key players to drive the price of an item up significantly and every credible bid in the process strengthens shareholder value. Finally, a lot of investors just automatically assume that the auction process is being run by Marissa Mayer and Yahoo's seemingly incompetent board of directors. This fails to account for the fact that activist investor Starboard Value recently claimed 4 independent board seats including one for Starboard chief Jeffrey Smith ( SA article ). Activist investors do not take stakes in companies lightly. They take stakes when they believe that their actions can bring about significant shareholder value and they will do everything in their power to unlock that value. I feel confident that the board will analyze the second round bids for Yahoo with shareholders' best interests in mind primarily because Starboard is in the mix. Yahoo's share price (around $35) currently represents the worst case scenario for the sale of its core business (in whole or parts) along with its cash holdings and stakes in Ali Baba (NYSE: BABA ) and Yahoo Japan. At a little over $35 a share Yahoo has very little downside no matter what the auction outcome is based on its other holdings. An auction sale at $2-3 billion still creates value in my opinion. An auction sale around $4-$8 billion creates even more value where the stock could trade from around $38-$42 dollars. An auction process that unlocks value around the high end of the range of $8-$10 billion dollars along with a shift of investor sentiment could result in a share price from $44-$55 a share based on a sum of parts valuation. I personally am a big fan of break even or win or win big scenarios and have a healthy position in Yahoo. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.
