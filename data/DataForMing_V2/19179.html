Apple Watch: What Are The Margins? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple Watch will go on sale Friday, April 24. In previous article we discussed possible sales revenue. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is challenging the watch industry with the new Apple Watch collections of smartwatches. Already there has been a great deal of speculation as to whether the new devices will be popular or not. In the previous article on Apple Watch Revenue Projections , we detailed several scenarios for sales of Apple Watches, broken down by collection and watch size. Each scenario gave a different proportion of sales for each model. By making reasonable assumptions of the ASP (average selling price) for each model, we were able to come up with an overall ASP for each scenario. In this post we try to estimate profit margins. These are all important as they determine the bottom line. In particular, the margins on the gold Edition collection models are of interest. Since Edition watches are so much more expensive than the others, even in low relative numbers, they will drive revenue. This can be seen clearly in the summary chart here, shown for each of the various scenarios or projections. The red line is the Percent of Total Unit Sales from the Edition collection. The green line is the Percentage of Total Revenue from Edition watches. The blue bars are Total Revenue for that model from all watches. It's easy to see how Edition sales drive revenue. At just 1% of unit sales, they provide 23% of revenues. A mere 4% drives over half, and 16% drives a whopping 85% of revenues. In a new calculation on my blog - Uber-Pessimistic with only 0.1% edition sales, the collection still accounted for 3% of revenue. Apple Watch comes in three collections. The lowest priced, anodized aluminum Sport, the stainless steel Apple Watch and the 18k gold or rose gold Edition collection. Prices are summarized below. In an earlier post on the topic, while I was mistaken on the final price of the Edition collection. However, my logic should still hold for the costs. Basically, the costs for each base model is the same as that for the Sport collection, plus the additional price of the case and band. Here I will ignore the price of the band, wrapping the additional gold of the Edition sport band's clasp into that of the case. Clearly there is more than just build costs to the total cost of a product. These include the development, R&D, advertising and operating system development costs that are assigned to the product. Since we know that Apple reported just shy of 40% gross margins, we can guess that this is the company's objective with the watches. The base models should then have a slightly lower margin, but not too much lower since these will most likely be the strongest sellers, unit wise. So I am selecting 38% as gross margin for the Apple Watch Sport collection, or a total adjusted cost of 62%. If we apply this to the 42mm Sport which is priced at $399, then we get a cost of $247. Deducting $7 for the band and the housing, we have approximately $240 as the total adjusted cost of the watch "mechanism." This is the basic cost for each of the watch collections, as the innards are identical for all. From here all the cost differences come from the casing and the band. The Edition collection obviously is the most costly as the body is real gold. Since this collection is the driver of revenue, getting a reasonable idea of the cost is important. The major component of cast is the gold itself. Playing with weight estimators for metals, I adjusted measurements for a sample rectangle until I reached a point where the given case weight minus the sample weight gave about the same results for both aluminum and steel (38mm sized watch). This was 2.66 cubic centimeters or 10x38x7 mm - which is allowing for the cutout for the mechanism. (Real external dimensions are 33.3 x 38.6 x 10.5 mm.) This sample size gave weights for both of the metals that left approximately 16 grams left over for the weight of the mechanism. The calculation for gold (@ density = 15.2 - low end of the 18k scale) left only 15 grams for the mechanism, but it's possible that Apple's alloy is slightly less dense than other 18K or that they remove a tiny bit more material. In any case, I think 16 g is a good estimate for the weight of the mechanism. This gives us the following estimated weights for the metal casings. The current price of gold is roughly $30 per gram (28.50) which leads to the final figures. (I go high to allow headroom for fluctuations in price.) In an earlier article we noted that Greg Koenig tweeted : For fun, I took my Apple Watch models and used SW and some basic assumptions to figure the gold content. 29.16g: The cost of making the aluminum and steel cases is probably just a few dollars. I am supposing that making the Edition case is more expensive. The promotion film shows that a certain part of the polishing process is done by hand. This is like that of the traditional luxury watch industry. It is probably expensive, depending on how much time is spent. In the traditional watch making world, a craftsman may spend days polishing just one small piece of the mechanism. It would not surprise me if several hours were spent polishing each Edition casing. The end result must be perfection. For this reason, I am suggesting a build cost for the casing of $100. At this point we might quit and think we are done for costs. For all other products we are. General operating expenses are not included in computing gross margin, and cost of build and advertising, etc. was built into the $240 figure above. But the Edition watches have some expenses that the others do not, and these need to be addressed. These are the Cost of Sale (COS) expenses. It's not that the others do not have them, only that they are so much higher for the Edition watches. First, there are two ways a watch can be sold: Resellers assume most of the COS, but at a price. The online store has lower extra costs, but still has some, and in store sales have a great deal of extra costs. Extra time staff spends to make a sale Here we discuss only the reseller of the Edition collection, which would be a high end watch or jewelry store. Aside from #1, a reseller will pick up most of the additional costs, perhaps all. However, they do so at a high fee. According to Alex Hofberg of Watchworks in Portland, Oregon, the typical split on high end watches has 40% going to the shop. Apple has a reputation for cutting costs of suppliers and some might think they would be aggressive in lowering this commission, but I doubt it. First, the reseller does have special costs and lower sales volume and so must have a viable commission. Apple needs to create a luxury aura around these watches and these exclusive shops play a truly vital part. Most importantly however, I believe Apple needs to create a luxury aura around these watches and these exclusive shops play a truly vital part. There will always be many who will never accept any Apple Watch as a real luxury product, but for a very large number, the fact that they are displayed in stores with the richest tradition will be enough to validate them as "acceptable." I don't think this point can be overstated. If Apple values this, then they have no desire to alienate shop owners by quibbling on commissions. Therefore, it is likely that Apple will offer the standard commission. In its own Apple Stores, Apple will see very significant costs due to the Apple Watch line as a whole and particularly the Edition. Apparently there will be special areas set up to display them one on one with interested customers. All the other factors listed above will play as well. Additional security will even affect online sales fulfillment. Many of these expenses are somewhat fixed, and so will depend on sales volume to determine the cost as a percentage of each sale. I think this will be higher than most people would guess, at least initially. I am going to estimate that in store and online store additional CoS will be 14% for in store and 6% for online. I will also estimate that 10% of sales will be through outside shops. Apple does appear to be opening special outlets in high fashion stores, but these are few in number in comparison to the 453 Apple Stores worldwide. The remainder will be split with 20% online and 70% in store. I think few people will want to buy at this price sight unseen, but some will. This estimate applies to the base model only. Let's replicate it for a higher priced band combination. The yellow gold, 38 mm watch with red band with modern buckle is one of the two most expensive models at $17,000. While other modern buckle bands sell for $249, they appear to have steel buckles and attachment pins. This one seems to be gold. According to Robservatory , which provides a wonderful spreadsheet with gobs of data about each watch for sale, the band weighs in at 41g, most of which must be the in the metal. While the clasp is gold, this is a non-magnetic metal, so some portion must be magnetic. So I will go for 38 grams as 18k gold, at a value of $1020. Lets add another $120 for the leather and fabrication to get $1200 for Apple's cost for the watch band. The chart shows values at both 15% and 35% Cost of Sales rates. The lower rates keeps a gross margin of 69%, but even with 35% sales costs we still have a 49% gross margin, way higher than Apple's average. Clearly we need to keep in mind that these figures come from educated assumptions, and so will undoubtedly vary to some degree. Yet the analysis appears reasonable and so gives us a range of values for gross margin. The analysis here shows that Apple will have very high margins on the Apple Watch Edition collection, probably in the 65% - 70% range. In my next article I will use this data and the charts from the previous post to give a range of values for the Apple Watch contribution to profits. Source: Apple Watch: What Are The Margins?
