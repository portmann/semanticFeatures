Click to print (Opens in new window) While the patent war between Apple and Samsung continues, the patent war between Apple and the University of Wisconsin has begun. This is a much shorter saga so far: it started in 2014, when the university’s patent-holding entity, the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation, sued Apple over the use of technology that makes processors more efficient, which Apple used in recent phones and tablets. The processors in question are the A7, A8, and A8X. They were used in some iPads, the iPhone 5S, and the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. A jury in Madison, Wisconsin found the patent valid, but Apple counters that it isn’t. The patent itself dates back to 1998 , and the Research Foundation has sued Intel for alleged use of the technology in 2008. Apple could owe the university up to $862.4 million in damages, and that’s before the jury decides whether the company willfully used the patent without paying royalties. The patent war between the technology company and the university may not be over yet: the research foundation has filed a separate suit alleging that the A9 and A9X processors used in the newest iPhones and iPads also use the offending technology and violate the patent.
