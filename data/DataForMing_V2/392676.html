Netflix: Still On Solid Ground - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Netflix missed subscription expectations, but in perspective, it's not the disaster many claimed it was. A high valuation comes with high expectations, obviously, but the business case is sound for investing in Netflix. Strong growth overseas as well as solid additions even in their near-saturated home markets show that there's still room to grow - albeit slower. Almost exactly two months ago today, I wrote an article about Netflix's international fix and how they had to surmount several issues before being able to transform the brand into a household name overseas - the way they've successfully done in mature markets. After the recent quarterly report, the stock got punished, and "short Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX )" articles have been pouring in like rain in Seattle - or so they say. We've all seen this pendulum-like oscillation between greed and fear before, and it seems like Netflix's pendulum will stay on the fear side for a while. There are several things I would like Netflix's current and prospective investors to think about before they decide to buy or sell the stock. I do think Netflix as a stock will remain volatile for several years to come, but I see that as a good thing. The biggest source of issue with the recent quarterly report is current subscriber growth and tepid guidance for the rest of the year. Shorts are having a field day after Netflix's management sought to revise the sentiment downwards for the company. In a recent article written by fellow author Shock Exchange, he stated that subscriber growth was disappointing, while the company actually added 6.7 million to their user base. The problem - as he correctly stated - was that it disappointed Wall Street analysts. Just in case you're unaware, they are an elite corps of intellectuals who are extremely good at predicting that things that are already going higher will go even higher, and things that are going lower will go even lower. Netflix grew its subscriber base by 6.7 million over last quarter; international and domestic subscribers increased by 4.5 million and 2.2 million, respectively. Analysts were expecting 1.77 million net adds in the U.S. and 4.36 internationally. The rub was that the company gave weak guidance. In Q2, Netflix expects to grow subs by 500,000 in the U.S. and 2 million internationally. Analysts were expecting 586,000 domestically and 3.5 million internationally. It's true that relatively slow subscriber growth was the cause of panic, but more than anything else, I believe the real shocker was the guidance. The 2.5 million net addition is the slowest they have seen in the last few years. The U.S. market, though I don't believe it's saturated, is going to be a slow growth one - and considering the competition they're going to see from YouTube, it's bound to move at a steady pace rather than a fast pace. International markets, as I detailed in my previous article , is where the real growth in user base is going to come from. The aggressive expansion into multiple countries in the last few years has helped the company gain significant numbers at a rapid pace. But the problem, as I noted earlier, was: "where is the localized content to keep the train chugging along?" They are depending on the English-language content they have built for U.S. customers and using that as a lure for the English-speaking population around the world. Now, they need to start building localized content in order to deeper penetrate markets they've recently entered into. My second point is that their business model is built on something so strongly viable that Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Prime Video, YouTube (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Red and every other paid streaming video company in the world do not need to reinvent the wheel. This a business that was born of the creativity of Netflix, and they have shown remarkable flexibility in changing directions as required by prevailing conditions. In that sense, Netflix literally blazed a path for other companies to follow. With video consumption on the rise along with mobile usage, paid streaming is here to stay. And as long as that continues to be the case, Netflix will stay close to the top of their industry segment. Netflix - and, possibly YouTube Red - are probably the only two companies in the world that have the ability and reach to bring a truly global user base to their respective ecosystems. But whether it's a behemoth like Google or an industry leader like Netflix, that kind of width and depth is not something that can be built in a matter of a few quarters. It needs a five-to-ten-year time frame for that to be done effectively and thoroughly. Investor-speak: Fingers at the Ready The problem for Netflix is their valuation, but what can you expect from a hyper-growth stock? Earlier, I suggested to my readers to keep their trigger fingers close to the buy button and wait for a subscription growth shocker instead of an earnings shocker to buy the stock - and that's exactly what has happened now. One important point here is that the company's valuation seems to go up and down based on the number of subscribers added every quarter. If you want to buy into this great idea, then the best time to do that is to not only wait for a earnings shocker, but for a subscription-addition shocker similar to the one that happened in October 2015 . Netflix has revised its estimates for Q1 2016 since then, but another shocker may just happen to shake the share price enough for you to get a foot in or add to your position. So that's what I recommend you do now, in my humble opinion. I sincerely hope that the market is now ready to adjust the "hyper-growth" label to a more stable "strong growth" one so Netflix can continue its disruptions around the world. My apologies for referring back to my older article so many times, but when I keep reading article after article that subtly (and sometimes, bluntly) suggests that Netflix is going to vanish as a business, I just can't help it. Now is the time to buy, and let's hope for even more "subscription shockers" in the next few quarters so that you can add them for cheap. I believe the business case for Netflix is strong; and for any hyper-growth stock, dollar-cost averaging or building up into a position over a two to three year time period is the best way to go about it.
