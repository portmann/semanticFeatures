Why Investors Should Buy Qualcomm Instead Of Intel - Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) | Seeking Alpha In the chip space, Intel and Qualcomm both look cheap, with similar valuation profiles and dividend yields. But their underlying business are going in different directions. Fundamentally, Intel is slowing down, due to its reliance on the PC industry, which isn't growing. By contrast, Qualcomm is a major player in mobile - a much better place to be, as the smartphone industry continues to boom. Among chip stocks, two companies reign supreme: Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ). On the surface, they seem very similar. They both operate in chip manufacturing, and as far as their stocks, both hold similar valuation profiles and offer similar dividend yields to shareholders. But to me, that's about where the similarities end. I believe Qualcomm and Intel are two companies going in two different directions. While Intel continues to be chained to the personal computer and it flails in its attempts to break into mobile, Qualcomm is already firmly entrenched in mobile, and dominates there. Their similar dividend yields don't tell the whole story- Qualcomm's dividend is growing at very high rates, while Intel's dividend has grown only slightly in recent years. The global smartphone boom is still in the early stages with plenty of growth left to continue, which is why I'm bullish on Qualcomm. Qualcomm's Snapdragon processor is used by a number of device manufacturers, including HTC, LG, Sony, and Droid. Even outside of mobile, the company's product portfolio caters to a diversified lineup of industries, including automotive, health care, wearables, and the Internet of Everything. Qualcomm grew revenue by 8% and adjusted earnings per share by 7% last quarter , year over year. This was because MSM shipments soared 24% in the same period, to 233 million units. Qualcomm generates a lot of cash, and now holds $29 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet with almost no long-term debt to worry about. In comparison, Intel continues to slow down, because its core industry-the personal computer-isn't growing. In fact, Intel's PC revenue was lower last year than in 2012. Last quarter , Intel's total revenue was flat year over year, as its client computing group, which includes its PC and mobile businesses, saw revenue decline 8%, due mostly to a 16% drop in desktop volume. And, there is little reason to think PC sales are going to ramp up anytime soon. There is an abundance of data indicating PCs are going to be weak for quite a while. First, global PC shipments fell 5% in the first quarter according to tech research firm Gartner . The company notes slowing corporate spending as the key factor, and Gartner now expects PC sales to decline in 2015. Moreover, the recent earnings report from semiconductor company Micron (NASDAQ: MU ) also signals a struggling PC industry. Micron manufactures dynamic random access memory, or DRAM, which is used in PCs. Last quarter , revenue fell 8% sequentially and 3% year over year. Micron's CEO specifically cited weakness in the PC industry as the main reason for the revenue decline. This is why Intel shares fell 3% on the day of Micron's report. To be sure, Intel is making progress in two key growth areas. These are data centers and the Internet of Things, which grew revenue by 19% and 10%, respectively, year over year. The problem is that these two areas are still dwarfed by Intel's PC business. Even collectively, data centers and the Internet of Things represent only one-third of Intel's quarterly revenue. Prior to Intel's recent reporting structure consolidation, the PC division itself represented approximately two-thirds of Intel's total revenue. Now, Intel has lumped together its PC business with its money-hemorrhaging mobile business, which lost a whopping $4.2 billion in mobile last year, up 35% from a $3.1 billion loss in 2013. Intel is spending a lot of money to try to get into mobile, which has resulted in a cash drain. Its cash and investments are now $14 billion, down from $19 billion at the same point last year. Going forward, Intel is deploying even more cash by turning to M&A to try to buy growth, with its $16 billion acquisition of Altera (NASDAQ: ALTR ). This merger makes sense strategically. With Altera's field-programmable gate array, or FPGA, technology, it will allow Intel to enhance its position in data centers and the Internet of Things, which are good things. But this acquisition didn't come cheap. Intel is paying $54 per share for Altera, which is about 37 times Altera's trailing earnings per share. Intel and Qualcomm offer similar valuations, as both stocks trade for about 12 times forward earnings estimates. And, both stocks' dividends yield 3% right now. But to me, the valuation and yield snapshots don't look deep enough. Intel and Qualcomm offer similar yields, but Qualcomm will quickly surpass Intel because of its rapid dividend growth. Qualcomm has increased its dividend by 20% per year over the past five years. Meanwhile, Intel's five-year dividend CAGR clocks in at just 8%. More recently, its dividend growth has really slowed. Prior to Intel's recent 6% dividend raise, the company had gone more than two years without increasing its dividend. Its huge buyout of Altera will be hard for Intel to swallow, and as a result, I don't expect Intel to raise its dividend for another year or two, like last time. Intel and Qualcomm are going in different directions. While Qualcomm is firmly entrenched in mobile, a growth industry, Intel continues to be chained to the PC. Intel does have some strong growth areas, but without a recovery in its core business, it will be very hard for Intel to grow both earnings and dividends.
