Apple Wireless: Can You Hear Me Now? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Media reports indicate that AAPL is testing a MVNO in the US and is in talks with EU carriers on a potential MVNO rollout. I believe an MVNO launch is credible as recent trends in AAPL Sim and iCloud voicemail all support this move. Implications include: Enhancing iOS ecosystem, broader penetration due to hardware footprint and negative impact (ARPU and churn pressure) on the telcos. According to reports, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is in talks to launch a mobile virtual network operator, or MVNO, service in the US and Europe . Sources indicate that AAPL has been privately testing a MVNO service in the US while currently talking with telecom companies in Europe about setting up the service. While this is not the first time the rumor of an AAPL MVNO has surfaced (the earlier ones first surfaced in 2006), several trends point to an eventual AAPL MVNO rollout. First, AAPL introduced the Apple Sim back in 2014 that allows the iPhone to seamlessly switch between carrier networks, a function that is necessary for MVNO to work as the model relies on signals from multiple wireless providers. Second, since the MVNO patent AAPL filed in 2006, the company has updated the patent several times, suggesting increasing interest in this field. Third, AAPL is reported to be testing iCloud voicemail that automatically transcribes voicemail messages using Siri. Prepping the voicemail ahead of a MVNO launch is a logical approach because the existing wireless model stores voicemail within the carriers' datacenter and AAPL needs to break from its carrier dependence on voicemail services before launching the wireless service. Investors should not expect a near-term launch of AAPL wireless but the significance and its potential disruption to the conventional wireless economics cannot be ignored. In my view, an AAPL MVNO is another step (similar to Apple Music) to strengthen AAPL's overall ecosystem due to the eventual commoditization of the iPhone. Unlike Google's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) MVNO project, I believe AAPL could see a higher chance of success given the broader hardware footprint. Finally, the successful launch of AAPL wireless could negatively impact Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) and AT&T (NYSE: T ) as the incumbent telcos could see accelerated postpaid churn and ARPU pressure. AAPL MVNO is another component to strengthen its ecosystem due to the flattening of the iPhone innovation curve. I have often argued that AAPL's ecosystem is facing a structural challenge given the lack of differentiation on the iPhone vs. high-end Android devices. (see: Apple: The Party Is Over; Initiating With A Bearish View ) In addition, iPhone faces a commoditization headwind as suggested by the decline in its gross margins. The real growth area in AAPL is its App Store and peripheral services designed to prevent the contraction of the iOS ecosystem. I see AAPL MVNO to be one of these derivative services. AAPL could significantly outperform Google's MVNO service due to AAPL's broader hardware footprint in the US and Europe compared with GOOG's Nexus devices. With 40% of the smartphone market share in the US, AAPL is well-positioned to become its own wireless carrier. Additionally, iTunes payment is already being used by most AAPL users and this should facilitate wireless billing and users switching from conventional telco companies. Negative implications to incumbent telcos I believe the successful launch of AAPL wireless could result in higher postpaid churn and ARPU pressure in T and VZ because AAPL will likely rely on its retail or online distribution of the iPhone and price its data plans at a fraction to that of the conventional telcos to drive higher iOS penetration. Given that most subscribers sign up to the traditional telcos because they are attracted to the iPhone, there is less incentive for the subscriber to obtain the iPhone from the telcos if AAPL decides to distribute both the phone and wireless services through its retail and online distribution channels. More important, investors should keep in mind that AAPL's key motive is not selling wireless services but driving higher iOS penetration. This means that AAPL could price the wireless data plan at a more disruptive rate than what the incumbents are offering to draw subs onto the AAPL network. Over time, I believe telco pricing power could see further downward pressure. I have been bearish on AAPL due to the commoditization of the iPhone but I am more positive on the company's strategy in building up its services. I am not willing to change my bearish view (see: Apple: Fundamental Story Taking A Turn? ) as I need to see further evidence of service traction. Source: Apple Wireless: Can You Hear Me Now?
