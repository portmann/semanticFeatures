Congressional Hearing On How Apple iPhone Encryption Makes "Worldwide Threats" Worse: Live Hearing | Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! With the last crash being the almost-terminal Crash of â€™08, readers have been warned on many occasions that the Next Crash is scheduled for this year.  Todays “Chart of the Day” from The Economist makes an attempt to show that gold isn’t doing any better when it comes to preserving buying power than currencies such as the Swiss... Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! Moments ago, the Permanent Committee on Intelligence launched a hearing on the topic of "World Wide Threats", whose unstated focus is whether Apple's encryption makes these threats worse. While AAPL employees are not present, yet, among those testifying will be Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency John Brennan, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation James Comey, Deputy Director of the National Security Agency Richard Ledgett, Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency Lieutenant General Vincent Stewart, and Director of the National Counterterrorism Center Nicholas Rasmussen. In other words, the "who's who" of everyone who wants to break into your iPhone. The opening statement can be found here . Here are some of the already noted highlights: FBI DIRECTOR COMEY SAYS APPLE DISPUTE COULD IMPACT OTHER CASES COMEY SAYS HE WANTS TO KEEP FBI OUT OF POLICY MAKING ON DISPUTE COMEY SAYS FBI IS USING ALL LAWFUL TOOLS TO INVESTIGATE CASE COMEY: NEED ROBUST NATIONAL DISCUSSION ON ISSUES IN APPLE CASE COMEY: APPLE CONFLICT `HARDEST QUESTION I HAVE SEEN IN GOVT' Thu, 02/25/2016 - 10:07 | 7233925 Looney The .GOV doesnâ€™t care about that particular phone â€“ itâ€™s all about the PRECEDENT. If itâ€™s done once, they donâ€™t need to go to court against every single phone manufacturer, big or small; they can just cite this case and force all phone/computer makers to decrypt EVERYTHING. I think?  ;-) Thu, 02/25/2016 - 10:10 | 7233944 TradingIsLifeBrah "Meanwhile, there are a whole lot more devices waiting in the wings, in the hands of state and local law enforcement. The Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, Jr. says heâ€™s asked Apple to unlock a whopping 175 iPhones. If the government wins in San Bernardino, Vance told PBSâ€™s Charlie Rose recently, he would â€œabsolutelyâ€? try to get Apple to help get data off those devices, too." Thu, 02/25/2016 - 10:13 | 7233973 Father Thyme Throw away your cell phone. And stay home. Preferably far away from other people. Stay well armed. That's the key to living "relatively normal lives," according to government research: On one side, we'll get three-letter agencies lying about their short-term and long-term intentions, and on the other side, we'll get the mobile computing device manufacturers lying about their technologies...complicated by the fact that these sides spend just as much time working together as they do at each other's throats. Meanwhile, we have a rather unique situation where getting the information off of this particular phone might actually be constructive to national security, but nobody on either side seems to give a shit because they've turned this case into a political football. Thu, 02/25/2016 - 10:39 | 7234171 pods There is not going to be any new info found on this phone.  Only precedent and the possibility of having the keys to the Apple castle. Every statist in the land has a raging hard on to get at tech like this to help with any and all cases, and no doubt spy on their wives and girlfriends. Thu, 02/25/2016 - 11:11 | 7234371 JRobby The fact that the story has gotten to this point shows that Apple has not been keeping up their political contributions. Thu, 02/25/2016 - 10:14 | 7233981 Boris Alatovkrap Government and law enforcement are like sponge, absorb any and every individual liberty in name of protecting citizenry, when really main objective is preservation andn expansion of state. Thu, 02/25/2016 - 10:21 | 7233998 Father Thyme Thu, 02/25/2016 - 11:01 | 7234315 Boris Alatovkrap Thu, 02/25/2016 - 12:01 | 7234603 Firepower Thu, 02/25/2016 - 10:36 | 7234148 junction The same Cyrus Vance who, working with then Mayor Bloomberg and the New World Order, framed Dominique Strauss-Kahn for rape, instead of soliciting a prostitute/hotel maid.  DSK phoned the hotel after he left it, asking if they had found the Blackberry he left in his room.  DA Vance's guy told the hotel manager not to tell DSK that the police wanted to talk to him.  Instead, they let him go to the airport where they arrested him, claiming he was a fleeing fugitive.  Then Criminal Court Judge Melissa Jackson, a hack Bronx ADA Bloomberg appointed to the bench (no one else would have), had an excuse to jail DSK without bail.  And Christine LaGarde became IMF Director, even though everyone knew she had been paid off by Bernard Tapie in the Credit Lyonnais bank case. Thu, 02/25/2016 - 10:12 | 7233962 Boris Alatovkrap Sorry, Boris is not up-to-date remember USSA political event, but is not James Clapper previously lie (tell less truthful) in front of Congress? This is absurd theater of Kabuki. Apple has reportedly fixed a problem with its iOS operating systemâ€”users reported that setting their clock back to January, 1, 1970 bricked the device. Apple has not offered an explanation of the exact problem or even announced what it has done to fix the problem, but iOS 9.3 beta 4, now available to developers and public beta testers, appears to solve the problem by disallowing users from setting their clocks to any time before December 31, 2000. Some have speculated that the problem arose in iOS devices because the operating system is UNIX based, where the first day of "UNIX  time " is, coincidently January 1, 1970. Since the devices keep track of time by noting how many seconds have passed since UNIX time began, they became locked in a loop trying to figure out what time it really was. Others have suggested there was an improper connection to  time zones . The bug was discovered by an unknown person or persons who used that knowledge to cause problems for othersâ€”postings on 4Chan urged users  to set their clock to January 1st, 1970 to get a special Easter Egg, and an even better surprise after they rebooted their device. Note: After dealing with years of problems with Microsoft, I switched to Apple and have been pleased with both the mac and iphone. No glitches outside of my eyes getting a little old and fat fingers on the iphone. I've got the Otter case and it is difficult to press on the screen in the corners to get it to do what I want. Thus is why a lot of my comments don't use correct caps etc.. Free advice:  When the government says "just the tip" don't believe them. Can't wait until they force someone to do this and it gets out in the wild. It will fucking decimate an entire OS. Thu, 02/25/2016 - 10:10 | 7233941 Boris Alatovkrap What Boris is hearing is state power scramble to constrain outlet for personal liberty and freedom. Always is some urgent need to strip liberty from individual, war on this, war on that. Oceana is always at war with EastAsia, citizenry is should be content with benevolent ration of chocolate issue by government. Thu, 02/25/2016 - 10:19 | 7234013 EarthShine Thu, 02/25/2016 - 10:24 | 7234052 junction I notice FBI Director Comey has a new hair dye job, no bottle black hair that looks like a shoe polish color.  On CNBC, Jim Cramer made a groveling comment about Comey, then left.  Between live coverage of the hearing, there is former FBI flack Shawn Henry lying his head off about what is going on.  Comey claimed the FBI can't hack the iPhone.  What about the NSA?.  The performance of these government clowns putting on an act reminds me of the end of the 1998 movie "Enemy Of The State." Even after their spy and murder plans went smash, the surviving government spies in that movie were still lying their heads off, covering up their crimes.  Just like now at the hearing, with Comey and Clapper pretending they follow the law. Thu, 02/25/2016 - 11:13 | 7234389 NuckingFuts I agree with father thyme on this one.  I own no smart phone, I do not text, I do not use "social media", I do not store personal information on a portable device.  Yet I still am self employed, successful enough to meet my needs and stack.  By example my kids learn, bring a book to a waiting room, not your phone.  Even the 16 yo has no Facebook page, not because we don't allow it but because he has learned from us how dangerous and stupid it is.  I don't care how convenient you may think it is or how much you think you need it, throw that shit away and free yourself.  And many call me a recluse, antisocial, misanthropic, etc...  But people suck.  Less people in my life makes me a happier person. Comey answers: Are you calling me  on the cellular phone? I don't know you. Who is this? Don't come here,  I'm hanging up the phone! Prank caller, prank caller! Criminal putin propaganda desperate lies about MH17 Anyone who understands Russian (and I do understand Russian) can  follow story how criminal putin regime propaganda machine has changed  itâ€™s versions claiming Ukraine responsible in downing MH17. 2014., 17.June (morning) â€“ criminal putin regime propaganda claims that pro-putin regime â€œseparatistsâ€? (aka criminal putin regime army mixed with terrorists) has downed Ukraine military cargo plane AN-26 ; 2014., 17.June (evening) â€“ criminal putin regime propaganda claims that Ukrainians has downed MH17 using rocket. It was done by mistake and actually wanted to down putinâ€™s plane; 2014., 21. July â€“ criminal putin regime propaganda claims that Ukrainians has downed MH17 using fighter jet Su-25 ; 2014., 21. July â€“ criminal putin regime propaganda claims that Ukrainians has downed MH17 using fighter jet Mig-29 and â€œbacks-upâ€? this version by â€œsatellite picturesâ€? that later was debunked and a great laughing stuff for world. 2014., 23. December â€“ as world laughed about faked pictures for  previous criminal putin regime propaganda claim â€“ putins propaganda  steps back  to version that Ukrainians has downed MH17 using fighter jet Su-25 .Because one guy told that he saw how rocket was launched from fighter  jet to MH17 â€“ yes, he saw that despite that should happen 10 km (6.21371  miles) up in the air; 2015., 2. June â€“ after international investigation was done and conclusion based on material facts was made that MH17 was downed by BUK,  criminal putin regime propaganda changed again itâ€™s version that â€“ yes,  MH17 was downed by BUK but it was not Russian, it was Ukrainian. So many versions, so many lies from criminal putin regime propaganda.  Are there any lunatics who still believes in criminal putin regime lies  propaganda? Yes, there are â€“ they are either criminal putin regime paid  trolls or brainwashed victims .

I should find at ZH any topic that reveals criminal putin regime lies and add my comment there? :D Thu, 02/25/2016 - 10:22 | 7234037 pods Man he/she was funny.  Americancitizenism and all. BTW, there are dozens of articles that at LEAST contain Putin, or Russia (say the John Kohn article from earlier). Thu, 02/25/2016 - 10:13 | 7233976 Homes Thu, 02/25/2016 - 10:17 | 7233993 Zinu How fair article you want about hitler war crimes? huh? And it was more like translation for facts - rather than article. It's facts you can check your self - if you understand russian. Thu, 02/25/2016 - 10:29 | 7234092 MrBoompi Here's a fact for you, if you can read and understand English.  Putin has a record high approval rating of 89%.  Not bad for a "criminal regime".  And America, who in your opinion had nothing to do the the coup in Ukraine and acts totally within domestic and international law (/s), is lucky to see any politician get over 50%.  And if ISIS is such a threat maybe we should stop helping them and help Russia instead.  But you and I both know the game here.   Thu, 02/25/2016 - 10:19 | 7234015 nevertheless LOL, and I am sure the site is funded by Georgie Soros and his band of jolly Zionists, just like their financial support for that filth "Pussy riot" and "FEMEN".  Thu, 02/25/2016 - 10:16 | 7233989 nevertheless What is your concern here, As an American, I concern myself with America, not Russia. You who make it your business to attack Russia and Putin, are nothing but Zionist propagandists.  I wish a few Russian jets would veer off course and bomb Saudi Arabia & Israel back to the stone age, the region, and indeed the world would be a far far better place for it.  Thu, 02/25/2016 - 10:19 | 7234014 Zinu I don't hate russians and I can't hate a country / teritory - that is absurd. What I hate is criminal regimes like hitler, mao, stalin, putin, kim jon-un, etc. And I can expose their crimes and lies. Thu, 02/25/2016 - 10:30 | 7234104 Sandmann Thu, 02/25/2016 - 10:25 | 7234065 dervish Russia doing something that would help mankind? Nope, wont happen. Them Satanists will get their way but will fail miserably in the end. And the end is all that counts. Hope it's near Thu, 02/25/2016 - 10:11 | 7233952 dervish Thats a bad act in a worse theater. Who believes that this crap has anything to do with national security? Freedom and liberty are already dead and won't come back until these mentioned institutions and people are not perished. A full belly makes man lazy and stupid, we deserve what came and is to come Thu, 02/25/2016 - 10:13 | 7233974 Calculus99 Cameron and many others in power say the Union is good for the UK, therefore it's good for them, not so good for the average Joe.
