Western Digital's SanDisk Acquisition Makes It Riskier Than Ever - SanDisk Corporation (NASDAQ:SNDK) | Seeking Alpha Oct. 24, 2015  1:33 AM ET  |  About: SanDisk Corporation (SNDK) , WDC , Includes: EMC , INTC , MSFT , MU , STX by: Chris Lau Western Digital is overpaying for SanDisk, in an attempt to remain relevant. Storage demand is slowing and pricing for faster storage is falling. Spinning hard disks are fast becoming a commodity, and Western Digital (NASDAQ: WDC ) knows it. Even though the interconnected web is creating more demand for storage space than ever, be it on devices, computers, or the cloud, there is a fundamental shift happening. Solid state drives are fast replacing drives. Western Digital's move to acquire SanDisk (NASDAQ: SNDK ) is an expensive one, and heightens risks for shareholders. Storage demand is slowing. Previously, companies could rely on enterprises for revenue growth. That is changing. As EMC Corp. (NYSE: EMC ) demonstrated, its earnings fell from $0.28 per share to $0.25. Sales barely changed, as the company made $6.08B, compared to $6.032B last year. Western Digital has a flaw in its plans for borrowing $18.4B to buy the overpriced firm, SanDisk. SanDisk's prospects in the solid state storage space are not assured, and trades at a premium at a stock price of $76.78. Not only is SanDisk's P/E 30 times, but the P/FCF (stock price to free cash flow) is 19.5 times. At these levels, the market is not discounting heavy competition ahead among the storage suppliers. Western Digital has its own problems too. Business is slowing and cash growth stalled, between 2014 and 2015. In the last four years, its cash leveled off at around $5B: Fortunately, free cash flow was steady in that time, but EBIT margin (%) fell from a peak of 17.06 percent to just 12.41 percent: SanDisk's EBIT margin is better, but also trended downward. This indicates there was higher competition amongst storage suppliers and weakening demand in the last few years: Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU ) is a competitive threat to Western Digital. Investors anticipate pressure for Micron, too, since its stock trades in the single-digit multiples: a P/E of 5.5 and forward P/E of 7.2 times. Looking ahead, Micron is readying 3D NAND and 3D Cross Point technology. It is converting its technology, expanding its Fab, and has a supply agreement with Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ). Intel accelerated its foothold in this space by announcing it would return to memory manufacturing. Micron's shares actually sold off because its partnership with Intel is now in doubt. This implies higher pricing pressure for non-volatile memory for all players. Investors might look at Seagate (NASDAQ: STX ) as an alternative for exposure in the storage space. Seagate trades at a P/E of just 7. Unfortunately, the commoditization of storage will hurt Seagate, too. Seagate preannounced on October 16 lower revenue and profitability. It cited weaker demand for its 4TB (terabyte) and 6TB drives. The sudden pace of consolidation in this space, first with Dell-EMC and now Western Digital-SanDisk will mean more downside pressure for storage suppliers. As Seagate struggles, Western Digital will be busy consolidating SanDisk in its business. It, along with Dell-EMC, will now carry higher debt loads. To manage that debt these companies must boost sales at any cost, increasing output and accepting any product selling price. Ultimately, this will mean lower profit margins for all players. Though Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) integrating across all channels from mobile devices to servers benefits the sector, Intel's vertical integration hurts non-volatile storage suppliers. Intel has the CPU and the GPU already, but offering non-volatile memory will add pressure to companies like Micron. With the market still shunning PC suppliers, investors should take advantage of the massive shifts happening - with Intel. Investors should consider avoiding hard-drive makers and instead, buying shares of Intel. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
