Apple: Positioning For Growth In India - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha The Indian government is proving receptive to Apple Stores and a possible iPhone factory in India. India's middle class, while small, has great growth potential. Recent news out of India should be viewed as encouraging for Apple investors. Chances are good that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) will be allowed to set up its iconic stores on the sub-continent, and its manufacturing partner will get approval to set up an iPhone factory there. As Apple's presence and India's middle class grow, so will Apple sales in the region. At Apple's fiscal Q2 conference call in April, CEO Tim Cook pointed out that iPhone sales were up 56% y/y in India. This still didn't put Apple in the top five smartphone vendors in India, according to data from research firm Canalys . Though in eighth place, Apple continued to climb in India, increasing shipments by 56% to make it the second fastest-growing vendor in the top 10. 'Apple is outperforming the overall market in India, and still has great growth potential,' said Canalys Mobility Analyst Wilmer Ang. It is seriously challenging Samsung's dominance of the premium segment. For devices priced over US$300 (INR20,000), Samsung's market share fell from 66% in Q1 2015 to 41% in Q1 2016, while Apple grew its market share from 11% to 29%. Sales in the region are still small (well under a million units in the quarter), and Cook acknowledged challenges in the region during the Q2 conference call Q&A: . . . if you look at India, and each country has a different story a bit, but the things that have held not only us back perhaps but some others as well is that the LTE rollout with India just really began this year, and so we'll begin to see some really good networks coming on in India. That will unleash the power and capability of the iPhone in a way that an older network, a 2.5G or even some 3G networks, would not do. And so the infrastructure is one key. The second one is building the channel out. Unlike the U.S., as an example, where the carriers in the U.S. sell the vast majority of phones that are sold in the United States, in India the carriers in general sell virtually no phones. And so it's out in retail, and retail is many, many different small shops. Clearly, Apple needs to establish its retail stores in India. The Economic Times of India reported on April 28 that a government committee has recommended waiving the local sourcing requirement that has kept Apple out of India. The committee, headed by the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP), was set up to decide whether a product could be exempted from the requirement by virtue of being "state of the art". The committee found that Apple's products met this requirement. Although the committee's recommendation has not yet the force of law, it's likely the Indian government will act on the recommendation. Furthermore, if the government approves Foxconn's setting up a factory in India, then Apple may be able to meet the local sourcing requirement in its stores anyway. On Monday, the Economic Times of India also reported that Foxconn was "close to a deal" with the Indian state of Maharashtra to set up a factory to assemble iPhones on a 1200 acre plot of land. The ET report seemed fairly confident that the deal would go through. Certainly all parties concerned are motivated. India receives a major high-tech manufacturing presence, Apple gets a local source for iPhone, and Foxconn gets to diversify out of China to a lower labor cost region. It's estimated that the plant will take about 18 months to be operational. This estimate seems a little low, and doesn't account for training time required for local workers. Assembling iPhones is primarily a hand process at the final stage, and it's a delicate one at that. I think it will take some time to get the workforce fully spun up and productive, but we're probably looking at a fully operational facility in about 2 years from ground breaking. Assuming that everything falls into place in India, what can Apple expect in terms of revenue? Certainly, India isn't quite as fertile ground as China has been. That's because the middle class in India is both much smaller and less wealthy than in China. Credit Suisse has a good economic report published late last year that makes this clear. The minimum total wealth to be considered middle class in India is $13,662 whereas it's $29,245 in China. Credit Suisse estimates that the number of middle class adults in China is 108.8 million (larger than the US at 91.8 million) whereas the number of middle class adults in India is estimated at just 23.6 million. There's some disagreement about whether Credit Suisse's total wealth definition (as opposed to income) is the best metric to use in defining the middle class, but there's little doubt that most of the population is still very poor, with 90% of the population below the level of the middle class wealth definition. The growth potential of the middle class in India is still very significant, however. According to the Credit Suisse report, India ranked 3rd in growth of the middle class in absolute numbers behind China and the U.S. since 2000. However, the change since 2008 has been small, indicating that growth has stalled in India since the recession. With a relatively small middle class, Apple's retail entry into India may have little noticeable impact to the top line at first. This is a case where Apple is positioning itself to grow with the Indian middle class when it resumes its growth. Apple can probably make it into the top five smartphone vendors by increasing its sales presence and through lower cost phones such as the iPhone SE. To go further, Apple will need the local factory, and possibly even lower cost phones targeted specifically at the Indian market. The move into India is really a long-term growth play. It opens up a new market, as well as shifts iPhone manufacturing to a lower cost structure. Perhaps the greatest near-term benefit is that it makes Apple less dependent on the People's Republic of China (PRC) for iPhone manufacturing. In my article, Apple: Why Icahn Is Wrong About China , I had speculated that Apple might have to pull manufacturing out of the PRC in response to government policy changes there. Apple can't pull out of the PRC if it has nowhere to go. Developing alternate sources for iPhone and other Apple products is the right way to respond to pressure from the PRC. It reduces the risk that the PRC will escalate its regulatory strictures on Apple. I remain long Apple and recommend it as a buy for investors with a 3-5 year investment horizon.
