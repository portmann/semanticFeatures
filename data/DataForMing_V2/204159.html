Apple's Issues In China: More To Do With Currency Than Fundamentals - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha For those who missed out on the rally, there's a distinct buying opportunity as a result of short-term market volatility. The biggest theme has been emerging market currencies, which as a basket weakened against the dollar. This has triggered speculation about the FX impact on Q4 earnings. Apple tends to report in-line with its outlook in the 2H of any fiscal year, which diminishes upside. Therefore, Apple might not report a blowout quarter, but is still undervalued regardless. I anticipate that Apple will trade around $136 by December, as I anticipate the market environment to become more accommodative to momentum names. Stocks have become pretty cheap, but most importantly Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has become incredibly inexpensive following the recent market selloff. Now would be an opportune time to pick up shares as short-term volatility is temporary and is unhinged from the company's fundamentals. I'm going to borrow a brief comment that Tim Cook shared with Jim Cramer: "I get updates on our performance in China every day, including this morning, and I can tell you that we have continued to experience strong growth for our business in China through July and August. Growth in iPhone activations has actually accelerated over the past few weeks, and we have had the best performance of the year for the App Store in China during the last two weeks." There's no denying that Apple earnings are going to be more heavily reliant on China, India and other emerging markets. Unit growth will likely offset foreign exchange related headwinds, however, there's no denying that on a constant currency basis many companies inclusive of Apple would've reported stronger earnings and revenue had currency not been an issue. Of course, Apple has much more pricing leverage and can offset foreign exchange through currency hedges, along with unit growth. Therefore, it's fairly reasonable to assume that Apple will report a relatively strong quarter from its Chinese segment in Q4 FY 2015. The data point that analysts are really worried about is the trade weighted US dollar. Now if we look at the traditional dollar index, it has consolidated over the past couple months. However, the trade weighted US dollar has trended significantly higher since the beginning of July, which covers all the other currencies, which reduces the weighting of the major currency pairs (EUR, CND, JPY, GBP, AUD, CHF). So the impact from emerging economies is reflected in the blue line on the graph, which indicates how exposed Apple is to foreign currencies. So, even if Tim Cook's statements on accelerating Chinese shipments are correct and continues to be the case for the duration of the quarter, we also have to anticipate that foreign currency effects will mitigate the company's ability to generate both revenue and earnings surprises in the fourth quarter of FY 2015. It may not completely neutralize growth, but it will diminish the size of the beat. Also, Apple usually reports in-line or slightly better than analyst consensus estimates in the third and fourth quarter of any fiscal year. Revenue tends to be driven by seasonality and inventory tends to be more indicative and forward-looking in the second half of the fiscal year. Hence, Apple's outlook tends to be more of a crystal ball when working with the second half of the year in comparison to the first half. Also, there seems to be a lot of criticism about the future growth potential of the upcoming iPhone 6S. For example, Fran Shammo (Verizon EVP and CFO) factored into his guidance deceleration of iPhone unit growth: So I think the margin itself speaks for itself. And from a seasonality standpoint, the one thing I would say, going back to the change in the revenue guidance, is, as we look out into the fourth quarter, keep in mind fourth quarter last year was an unusually very high-volume quarter that generated a lot of equipment revenue and the bulk of our sales were still on the equipment subsidy model. And that hovered around the new 6 and 6-Plus that came out. I just don't see that the next iconic device is going to be substantially different and, therefore, I don't see that - and this is just me speaking - I don't see the volume there in the fourth quarter that we had last year from a total iconic change of the 6 and the 6-Plus. So I think that will also benefit us from just a margin perspective. Admittedly, Fran has a bias toward weakening iPhone sales because it will improve margins. However, he speaks to the broader consensus views of both CFOs and sell-side analysts whereas buy side analysts seem to be more optimistic on iPhone unit growth in FY 2016. That being the case, iPhone sales seem less dependent on US subscribers, and there's no denying that there's an aging subscriber base of older iPhone users. So in reality, if there is growth in the United States it would have to be driven by market share gains and movement from low-end to high-end devices. Also, Apple has been able to retain its installed base, and so as long as there is demand in emerging markets where consumption trends have been very strong then it's pretty realistic to anticipate that iPhone units will grow slightly above 20% in the next fiscal year, which seems supported by rumored order figures. The valuation will eventually stabilize to a point where the P/E multiple will revert to the mean. Since the stock is heavily undervalued, it's fairly reasonable to assume decent upside from current levels. The stock may have found bottom. Market sentiment has been weak, but I don't anticipate this to continue for much longer. I anticipate Apple will reach $136 by the end of December. I continue to reiterate my buy recommendation despite the recent market volatility. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
