Reuters: Verizon hires i-bank that advised Yahoo last year - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha May 26 2016, 20:33 ET | About: Verizon Communications (VZ) | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Verizon ( VZ +0.6%) is getting a leg up on competing bidders for the core assets of Yahoo ( YHOO +3.3%) -- by hiring an investment bank who was one of Yahoo's top advisers last year, Reuters reports. The telecom has reportedly added Bank of America to its team -- which would offer not only intimate knowledge of Yahoo, but also a big balance sheet in case of financing help. Yahoo's other investment banks (Guggenheim, LionTree, Allen & Co.) are boutiques with limited ability to fund the deal. BofA was lead adviser last year when Yahoo explored spinning off its stake in Alibaba, a plan it later abandoned. While Verizon's prepared to buy all the core assets, sources said, it's mainly (and unsurprisingly) interested in the ad-tech tools, and perhaps things that can be combined with corresponding businesses at AOL. Look like the sale of core Yahoo assets is now a real deal. Adding to the mix of ATT as reported today will ensure the fair price ultimately paid, contrary to the short articles tried to portray.  Shorts better cover soon.  The leak on bidding prices for the next round in June will be substantially higher with so many interested parties. Check the offshore banks to make sure McAdam isn't getting some special beans. Actually, I would be happy as he would be toast and at least we would know why he has made such stupid decisions of the last few years - from Go90 to AOL and Yahoo. Meanwhile Sprint is deploying 5g micro cells - something VZ could have been doing and using their FiOS fiber backbone to help implement such a strategy without the need to relay to a big tower, etc.  Our BoD obviously is being kicked back by McAdam's nonsense as they can't see the water up to their ankles - let's hope they feel the water soon. One would have to look at the details of this iBank as there could be violations of the 1940 Investment Company Act and 1940 Investment Advisors Act‎‎, etc. ETF Screener: Search and filter by asset class, strategy, theme, performance, yield, and much more ETF Performance: View ETF performance across key asset classes and investing themes
