Intel: Time For Some New Management - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha "All other expectations" have been withdrawn. On Thursday, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) announced startling news that guided revenue for Q1 2015 down to $12.5B-$13.1B, below prior guidance of $13.2B-$14.2B. That guidance was presented just a few weeks ago on January 15th. In my two previous articles on Intel in February ( here and here ), I warned that the enthusiastic projections of Intel's business for 2015 were fraught with potential problems. Well, the problems have already started. Intel's famous 3-year transistor lead is meaningless to shareholders. Intel is famous for telling investors and anyone else who will listen, how far ahead technically they are compared to their competitors. Here's a chart Intel created to show their superiority: Let's compare the Transistor chart with Intel's stock price over the last 10 years: This second chart shows that every year for the last ten the NASDAQ composite has outperformed the Greatest Chip Manufacturer in the History of the World. So how exactly did shareholders benefit from this supposed superiority? Well, the fact is they didn't because the technical superiority did not translate into shareholder value. And then there is the PE ratio for the "Greatest Chip Manufacturer in the History of the World." That is pretty pathetic too. And pity the poor guy who bought Intel shares on July 19, 2005 at the high-price of the day, $28.84, compared to a price right now on March 12, 2015 of $30.98. If he is still holding those shares he has a gain of less than 8% after almost 10 years of technical superiority. How did other chip manufacturers do over that same time period? Well let's look at Intel competitor Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM ) who supposedly has been three years behind in technical prowess for the last 10 years at least compared to Intel. Beating the NASDAQ Composite 8 out of the last ten years sure looks a lot better than Intel, doesn't it? Only bad management can bring such mediocre results to a great company. As I have said repeatedly Intel is a great, even iconic American company. But in spite of all the technological advancements they have introduced to the semiconductor industry they have consistently over-promised and under-delivered. That can only result from bad management decisions. The current CEO seems to lack focus, spending too much time on making drones or introducing $500 smart bracelets (" kind of chunky ") rather than managing his $55 billion company. And that company basically makes 90% of its profits on legacy products for desktops and w86 servers both of which will increasingly come under market pressure over the next two years. The first quarter revision amply demonstrates that the legacy side of the business needs more attention than bracelets and drones. And CFO Stacy Smith seems to be of the same unfocused bent writing Haikus for each investor day presentation. Here's his current one: Intel likes to brag they have only had 6 CEOs in 45 years . Five of them have been engineers, including current CEO Brian Krzanich (BK) and one a financial guy, Paul Otellini. In addition they have all spent decades with Intel and in the case of Otellini and Krzanich their entire careers. The problem with engineers and financial types is they are internal looking, often at their desks looking at either engineering drawings or financial statements. Maybe it's time for some new outside blood to come in to the corporate suite. Perhaps someone more sales and marketing oriented, someone who will look outward toward customers rather than inward. Intel needs to make products customers want to buy right now whether they are leading edge or not. Because of the management issues at Intel I recommend avoiding the stock for at least the rest of the year. There will be plenty of time to reconsider in 2016 after the 2015 annual CC. Of course, a management change involving an outsider would immediately perk up my interest. After all Intel is a great company, they just need great management to run it successfully.
