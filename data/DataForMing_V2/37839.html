Apple, IBM: An Engagement Focused On Healthcare Analytics - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha  |  Apr. 24, 2015  4:08 AM ET  |  About: Apple Inc. (AAPL) , IBM by: Matt Margolis The driving force behind Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and IBM Corp.'s (NYSE: IBM ) partnership announced last summer is data analytics. IBM will drive data analytics collected from the Apple Watch to enable doctors, researchers and insurers to cut costs and improve patient care decisions. Patient data is the Holy Grail behind human behavior, specifically how the human body heals and reacts to external factors, the environment and stimulants. Millions of terabytes of analyzed patient data will lead to advancements in disease research, disease treatment and clinical trials. When Apple and IBM announced a partnership last summer to transform enterprise mobility, my first impression was that the deal would be primarily focused on pushing Apple hardware to corporations, as well as incorporating IBM applications and services. I attended a meeting earlier this year with a few IBM sales reps, and they certainly were "up-selling" Apple hardware offerings during this meeting, but the partnership between the companies is much deeper than hardware. The patient data collected from the Apple Watch and other devices will hold the key to disease management, patient care between facilities and your primary physician, healthcare providers and patients. Last week, IBM announced the Watson Health Cloud, a platform that will bring together clinical, research and social data from a diverse range of health sources, creating a secure, cloud-based data-sharing hub powered by the most advanced cognitive and analytic technologies. Earlier this month, I discussed why Apple's Watch will be moving from a want to a need by 2020. IBM's Watson Health Cloud announcement working in conjunction with Apple's HealthKit and ResearchKit, and Apple's iOS devices will help ensure that the Apple Watch becomes a necessity in our daily lives by 2020. Currently, healthcare providers analyze patient claim data to contain and reduce medical costs. In just a few years, these same healthcare organizations will be able to analyze real-time patient data, coupled with medical claims, to help prevent costly surgeries and even unforeseen medical emergencies. IBM Watson Health will dramatically improve the ability of doctors, researchers and insurers to surface new insights from the health data being collected and analyzed daily. Two of the programs being targeted by IBM's Watson include cancer treatment research and clinical trial matching. According to IBM's Watson website , healthcare leaders already working with IBM Watson include Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, the Mayo Clinic, New York Genome Center, Cleveland Clinic and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. The next wave of health-centric wearable devices will connect hundreds of millions of patients' data to researchers, doctors and healthcare organizations. The public and private sector will have to invest billions of dollars of capital to acquire, modify and retrofit their existing software and infrastructure to accommodate and analyze the inflow of real-time patient data. Smartphones created a tremendous market opportunity for memory and storage providers. Wearable devices, coupled with Big Data will require the next wave of capital investment in wireless infrastructure, memory, storage, analytical software and IP. Hundreds of millions of wearable devices will require built-in storage, as well as wireless enabling connectivity components and always-on sensors. Networks will need to be built out to accommodate a tremendous need to upload and download data via wireless networks.
