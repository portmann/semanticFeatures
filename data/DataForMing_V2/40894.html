Guggenheim says it's cautious on media networks, but Disney has "significantly outperformed media peers" and has key assets that should cascade into multiple revenue streams -- namely, Marvel's upcoming Avengers: Age of Ultron, and an upcoming set of Star Wars films, which "should fuel incremental future media, parks and product opportunities." The analysts set a $127 price target on the stock, up previously from $109.53. Shares closed today at $110.16. ETF Performance: View ETF performance across key asset classes and investing themes
