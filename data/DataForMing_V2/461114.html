3 Exciting Topics To Follow In This Busy Earnings Week | Seeking Alpha Yahoo: Expected to Unveil the Outcome of the Final Bidding Round. PayPal: Earnings Amid Visa Takeover Rumors. The upcoming week is going to busy with the earnings releases of companies in all sectors: Financials, tech, industrials, energy, healthcare, consumer staples and more. Overall, a whopping 116 companies will announce their earnings this week. But I want to focus on just a few of them. The highlighted companies have an interesting and compelling story, unwinding a long-lasting trend or process that could have a substantial and fundamental impact on the company and could trigger significant fluctuations in stock prices. An endless sell process started from the company's desire to spin-off its Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) stake and ended with Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) offering its core business, real estate, and patents to the highest bidder. After many tech companies and investment firms reviewed the material and played with the idea of acquiring some of Yahoo's assets, only four remain in the race: Verizon (NYSE: VZ ), AT&T (NYSE: T ), Gilbert/Buffet group, and TPG. Offers range from $3B to $5B and are differentiated from one another depending on whether the offered tender includes patents, real estate, or only the core business (or even parts of it). Final bids are expected by Monday morning, and the company will report its Q2 earnings after the market closes that day. As the bidding round results become available, Yahoo's operating performance becomes secondary to any news about developments in the selling process. Investors should follow Yahoo's earnings announcement on July 18 and conference call for more details about the company's direction. Bid size, the identity of the winner, terms of the deal, and timeline could all impact stock price this week. Coffee retailer Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX ) will report its Q3 FY16 results on Thursday, July 21, amid the significant amount of news coming out of the Seattle-based company. Starbucks received mixed comments when the company announced it is increasing prices in the US, increasing employees' wages, launching mobile payment in China and more. However, the most interesting development was the announced partnership with Princi, an Italian bakery that will offer its baking goods in a new Starbucks store format called Reserve-only stores. The new format will be different from the current Starbucks store and will be more similar to an Italian café with a fully integrated bakery operation within the store. The new format is currently planned for launch in New York and Shanghai. The deal with Princi and the new stores' format is significant as Starbucks tries to shift more focus to food sales from coffee beverages sales to protect the company from the rally in coffee prices and prepare for a potential slowdown in the economy when people purchase fewer $5 lattes in Starbucks stores. As shown in the chart below, coffee prices have soared more than 30% year-to-date, and investors are eager to find out what the impact was on the company's financials and, of course, what the impact will be if this trend continues. Fueled by the rally in stock price (slightly trimmed on Friday), speculations about a potential deal with Visa surfaced in the previous week and dominated the social media chat about PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL ). After Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), AmEx (NYSE: AXP ), and MasterCard (NYSE: MA ) were linked recently to a PayPal acquisition, Visa is the current candidate (according to rumors) to acquire the leading e-payments giant. Even though none of the companies responded to the chatter, the dry facts show that something is going on-PayPal moved its earnings call to July 21 in adjacency to Visa; journalists looking for answers from PayPal were ignored, and the options volume for July and August, above calls with strikes above $40, surged. It seems that, unlike previous rumors, this one might materialize, and the related parties (PayPal and Visa) will address the deal terms on Thursday. Last week, many investors published posts on social media, stating their newly-opened options position to capture the potential PayPal-Visa deal upside. As a long-term investor who has held PayPal since the spin-off, I believe that investors should not overlook a scenario in which PayPal and Visa do not announce a merger but rather another dramatic change that will have a negative impact on stock prices, such as discontinuing their partnership or some other extreme scenario.
