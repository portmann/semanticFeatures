Amazon heads into huge Prime Day event at all-time high - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Jul  9 2016, 11:03 ET | By: Clark Schultz , SA News Editor Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) is gearing up for this year's Prime Day with marketing efforts running at full throttle. The event scheduled for July 12 will see Prime members get a crack on deals on over 100,000 items. The company is promising a more engaging assortment this year after taking some criticism a year ago. Last year, Amazon pulled in about $375M to $400M in revenue on Prime Day. MKM Partners estimates that mark could be doubled this year. Analysis from JPMorgan suggests that Amazon Prime Day pulls forward some retail sales during a typically quiet period. The shopping bonanza and boost to Prime stickiness could be a headwind for Target (NYSE: TGT ), Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ), and Best Buy (NYSE: BBY ). This year's event will also serve as a critical test for the Seattle e-commerce giant on the fulfillment front. Amazon carved out a new all-time high of $746.10 on Friday. Shares are now up 70% over the last year which has led to no shortage of analysis and debate  from Seeking Alpha contributors on the AMZN trade. should be great improvement in the operation and offerings between year one and two.. i think the prediction of doubling will be low, gonna predict over a billion this time.. many millions more prime members since last july and should be able to find things much easier this year.... man i hope so.. Honestly, is there anything that can rival AMZN?  At this point and in into the foreseeable future, they are unstoppable. With the market place and AWS, lots of growth to come.   I would love to buy more soon. Their video and music offerings are very pedestrian, like to the point where I don't bother accessing them. That is about the only weakness I see for AMZN in the next five years. The improved efficiency of robots in warehouses, multiplied by AMZN's massive inventory = huge savings in everyday operations. They are a small company who learned to become big and still remembered how to refine themselves for further success. Amazon has been fairly aggressive in obtaining and creating video media, with a lot of award-winning original productions and the very recent deal with BBC for exclusive distribution, as examples. I don't watch many shows, but have seen a couple of episodes of Transparent and The Man in the High Castle and at least those episodes were hardly pedestrian.  Apparently a lot of the other shows and original movies are generally considered to be worth watching. Music does seem to be of less importance to Amazon than books or video, but they do have some exclusive content there, too. If you look at what they have done with digital books and publishing, I think you will see similar efforts in other media.  For instance, they have a book contest each year that awards publishing contracts, and they have reissued classics.  I could see them restoring and reissuing old films, creating a music label, etc. Their video and music section is a pain to find the CD that you are looking for especially for classical music. Most often, I find the same CD at a substantial lower price at my brick and mortar store where I can check the physical condition of my purchase. For the few times that I have ordered from Amazon, sometimes the CD case was damaged. It's a pain to have to return them as sometimes it is the only copy that they have in stock. Much better experience browsing at the record store and being able to talk to their knowledgeable staff and not to forget the health benefit of walking to it. Prime day will be a bust, but markets won't care. Amazon could lose a Billion in one day, stock still would bid higher. Still holding my 500 @ 142. The most amusing thing is the numerous stories about WMT, and BABA, and (name your favorite wannabe) rolling out new programs and strategies to catch up/overtake Amazon. Anyone who believes that claptrap skipped class the day they taught the concept of "that ship has sailed." Question, are in bed with Amazon stock holders? This is a strange this to write about. Why not do the same story on other retailers. bc this is about amazon prime day and obviously it was started by amazon so this short piece is on amazon Walmart had better be careful. They seem bent on starting a price war with AMZN. It's a war that they will lose. By 2025 , AMZN will rule the world and jef bezos will the president of the USA. He is absolutely iconic and fit for the job. By then most shopping malls and brick and mortar stores will have gone BK (helped by the 2008 crisis 2.0 brewing at this point and just waiting to get out of its egg in the next few years) and those spaces will be replaced by AMZN multiple warehouses. Stock will trade around 8.000/10.000 USD a share (at current stock counts). It seems outrageous but by then the P/E ratio will be a mere 10/15 as i said, the company will have gobbled up ALL the global retail business. Lots of book, music, and video stores have closed over the past twenty years or so but there is apparently still a need for them, so Amazon is filling that need by opening physical locations, especially on near college campuses.  They are similar to the catalogue service centers that Sears used to have, no inventory on site, like a hybrid between B&M and internet retail. Katzung- try it out- buy a share and see where it goes. Over the years since 1980- I've taken some risks and some do well, some don't. But there always came a time to buy more at a better price. That's what is so nice about Amazon.  It's been a great company for consumers and the stock has done extremely well for investors, too.  Best of both worlds! I am a Prime member and long AMZN.  I look at it like this, if you don't like shopping on Amazon, then don't shop on Amazon. If you think AMZN stock is "too expensive " then don't buy AMZN stock!
