With the company openly shopping around its core search and ad business after deciding not to spin off its massively valuable shares in Alibaba, the rumor mill is swirling that MarissaÂ will be fired before any kind of sale goes through. Today, with Mayer on maternity leave caring for her newborn twins, a presentation has surfaced detailing why she – and 9,000 of her closest employees – should be fired immediately (Happy Holidays!) in order to preserve what’s left of Yahoo’s value. The document was authored by Eric Jackson, a hedge fund manager at SpringOwl Asset Management which owns a tiny slice of Yahoo stock. Jackson uses 99 PowerPoint slides to lay out his case that while everyone has bought into the narrative of Yahoo being a smoldering ruin, it is actually undervalued after being run into the ground by Mayer. Johnson also floats the idea of selling Yahoo’s headquarters and moving whoever survives the purge into a small office.Â It’s quite a read, if only for beautiful trolling images like this: “The Big Short” Is Wall Street’s Answer To Star Wars Layoffs Watch ’15: New Barclays CEO Mulling Over Giving Additional 20% Of Investment Bank The Heave-Ho Minority Shareholder Spends 99-Pages Telling Yahoo Why Marissa Mayer Is Literally THE Worst The Top 10 Things Wall Street Was Only Pretending To Understand In 2015 Guy Who Once Bought President Trump’s Yacht For $40 Million Thinks It’s High Time That President Trump Shuts Up Forever Emo Bro Martin Shkreli Blows $2 Million On Sole Copy Of New Wu Tang Clan Album Because He Is Desperate To Bang Taylor Swift Layoffs Watch ’15: Morgan Stanley To Tell A Whole Lot Of Employees To Clean Out Their Desks CEO of Burrito Joint That Recently Poisoned Hundreds Of People: “We’re Gonna Be The Safest Place To Eat” Layoffs Watch ’15: Morgan Stanley Not Wasting Any Time Warren Buffett Has Three Weeks To Show This Dow-DuPont Deal Isnâ€™t So Great Tony James Had A Little Get-Together So Hillary Clinton Has Tons Of Money Now Dan Loeb Will Have His Scalp, And Spinoff, Too 162152No commentshttp%3A%2F%2Fdealbreaker.com%2F2015%2F12%2Fminority-shareholder-spends-99-pages-telling-yahoo-why-marissa-mayer-is-literally-the-worst%2FMinority+Shareholder+Spends+99-Pages+Telling+Yahoo+Why+Marissa+Mayer+Is+Literally+THE+Worst2015-12-14+18%3A09%3A19Thornton+McEneryhttp%3A%2F%2Fdealbreaker.com%2F%3Fp%3D162152 High-Frequency Monitoring: A Short-Sighted Behavior The more frequently you monitor your portfolio, the more likely you are to observe a loss.
