ETF Hub Mar 14 2015, 08:00 ET | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Sony Pictures Television (NYSE: SNE ) is within a few weeks of a deal to sell the episode library of hit '90s sitcom Seinfeld to a video streaming service: Hulu ( CMCSA , DIS , FOXA ), Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ), or Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ), and thus maybe to a whole new generation of viewers. Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) won't be among them, though, as it's passing -- which gives competitors a chance to nab a TV crown jewel and make up some ground in a content-acquisition arms race. Seinfeld -- a show that has generated more than $2.7B in syndication sales alone -- has 180 episodes, each of which should draw well over $500K in what should be a long multi-year agreement. While Sony has distribution rights and is making the deal, most of the revenue would likely go to Time Warner (NYSE: TWX ), owner of Seinfeld producer Castle Rock Entertainment.
