Apple: Debating U.S. iPhone Upgrade Challenges - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha CIRP says that US iPhone sales may struggle in coming quarters. I believe that the data shows the opposite picture. Installed base could top 100 million this year. Last week, research firm CIRP issued a somewhat challenging report regarding Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPhone in the US. While the installed base of the phone continues to increase, the firm believes that the size of the upgrade group relative to the number of iPhone 6 units sold may challenge Apple in the coming quarters. Today, I want to examine this report because I think the data details why investors should actually be positive at the moment. The first point that CIRP made is that the iPhone installed base rose to 94 million, a new quarterly high. This includes 25 million units of the iPhone 6, along with 13 million units of the 6 Plus. The rest of Apple's US installed base is primarily spread among the 4 and 5 model lines. The chart below from CIRP is the heart of this argument, and I've added three circles to detail a key point. (Source: CIRP data from linked article above) The circles represent the installed base minus the most recently launched device in the given March period. In March 2014, Apple had around 43 million or so holders of the 5 and 4S. For those who upgrade every two years, this would be the primary group ready to buy a new phone, which last year was the 6 and 6 Plus. A year later, CIRP states that there are 56 million potential upgrades out there. There's about 30 million who have the 5S and 5C, launched in 2013. While CIRP sees a challenge here for Apple, I think that there's actually an opportunity. I detailed a few weeks back how Apple might launch three new iPhones this September. We could see two new versions of the larger screen phones, plus a smaller version (same screen size as 5/5C/5S) with upgraded hardware/software. Not only does Apple satisfy those who want the larger screen, but this allows those who want to keep the size of the 5 line to stay with the 4-inch screen. One item that could benefit Apple's upgrade cycle is the tremendous phone carrier war we've seen in the last year or so. Those who have older models of the iPhone may get a new phone just because phone/data plans are becoming a bit cheaper. In a recent article I wrote about Sprint (NYSE: S ), I discussed how the carrier's average postpaid revenue per user was down 10.4% in calendar Q1 2015 over the prior year period. The iPhone could see a nice tailwind from consumers who are looking to cut their phone bills. Some consumers may not need to upgrade, but may be able to save more on a new plan over the next year or two than a new phone would cost. There are two major risks I'd like to discuss when it comes to the next set of iPhones. The first is on the technology side. One recent complaint according to a Quartz article is that Apple's software is not living up to the company's normally high standards. It looks like one of the major focuses of iOS 9 will be more stability. Having too many bugs in your system can send consumers away. We recently saw Apple acquire a high-precision GPS service, which could help upgrade Apple Maps. Apple needs to develop a decent software package, but at the same time it has to put in some tremendous bells and whistles. One of the reasons I discussed for iPad sales falling off was a poor refresh in 2014. Newer versions of the tablet really didn't offer any major differences from the prior version, which cut down the number of people looking to upgrade. I mentioned above the possibility of three iPhones to satisfy those who want smaller screens. If Apple decides to go this route, it needs to make sure that the 4-inch model gets a tremendous hardware upgrade. If Apple doesn't do this, it may not attract all of these users looking to upgrade, and these consumers may hold their older models for a longer time period. The other worry I have for the iPhone upgrade cycle is in regard to the consumer. If Apple comes out with too many new products throughout the rest of 2015, there may be some sales pressure on the iPhone. Apple has already launched the Apple Watch and most consumers and investors are looking for a larger screen iPad later this year. If the company launches something else that consumers flock to, there may be some pressure on phones. We may see the average consumer decide to wait a little longer to upgrade their phone, or perhaps they trade down on the model line (buying a less expensive version). While Apple's top line number may not be hurt if a consumer buys a new iPad instead of a new iPhone, the bottom line could be hurt if more lower margin products are sold. The iPhone has been the star of the show for Apple, blowing out estimates for fiscal Q2 with more than 61 million units sold. Sales momentum for the phone did not slow down, and Chinese sales were especially strong. With the larger screen phone selling for higher prices and blowing past estimates, we've seen quite a large boost to analyst estimates in the past 13 months. The table below shows how much these forecasts have jumped, with the company's large share repurchase plan also providing a nice boost to EPS. In conclusion, CIRP seems a bit down on Apple, but I think investors should be quite positive. The installed base of the iPhone in the US continues to increase and could top 100 million this year. There is an increasing number of iPhone users who need to upgrade, about 13 million or so more than the same time a year earlier. Apple has an opportunity to satisfy a wide range of consumer desires this year with the potential launch of three phones. This could push iPhone unit sales and revenues to new all-time highs.
