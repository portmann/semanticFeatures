Converting Apple Options Into A 4.25% Certificate Of Deposit - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha ZIRP has decimated the viability of traditional fixed-income investments, forcing income investors to chase yield in the market. Apple's recent decline has created opportunity in its long-term options chains for more risk averse income investors. These options can be converted into an income investment with similar properties to a certificate of deposit. Certificates of deposit are not an attractive type of investment for a Millennial investor such as myself. I have time on my side, and the risk-reward ratio of keeping my investment capital in high quality equities is low. Certificates of deposit used to be popular with retirees on fixed income when they were yielding 4+% many years ago, but the Federal Reserve's ZIRP has all but eliminated the once-coveted CD as a viable investment vehicle. What is a retiree looking for a "safe" 4+% yield to do? Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ), once one of the market's most coveted darlings that could do no wrong, has had a tough year. Recently, the stock has been hammered on the news of decreasing smartphone demand due to increasing upgrade cycle terms. This has caused the market to turn bearish on Apple, and as a result, the company has severely underperformed the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA: SPY ). This temporary bearishness has created an opportunity for investors that have a long view, driving yields up and P/E ratios down to an unprecedented level. Currently, Apple is valued as follows: This negative market sentiment has also unlocked unprecedented opportunity for retirees among us by causing shockwaves in Apple's options chains. The Death Of The Certificate of Deposit A certificate of deposit [CD] is a savings certificate that entitles the bearer to receive a predetermined rate of interest at the predetermined maturity date. Typically issued by commercial banks, certificates of deposit are insured by the FDIC and generally considered a "risk free" investment. CDs are typically offered at terms of as little as one month to five years. Historically, CDs have been a fantastic investment vehicle for seniors, delivering a nearly risk-free 5-7% yield on their cash. Certificates of deposit, paired with typical pension incomes and Social Security benefits, provided the retirees of this country a very comfortable lifestyle for much of our recent history. This is the American Dream we have all heard of at work. The Fed's ZIRP has eroded that security to the point of obsolescence. The past 5 years has painted a terrifying picture for those living on fixed income. Certificates of deposit, once a nearly "perfect" investment vehicle for retirees, have been all but destroyed. With average yields well below 1%, investing in CDs today is akin to financial suicide. A CD bearer is all but guaranteed to severely underperform inflation while simultaneously offered no liquidity, locking their cash away for months or years at a time for virtually no return. Holding cash long-term is a smarter investment because at least you are given liquidity with cash. As a result, many seniors have been unwillingly forced into the market to chase yield by investing in historically less volatile dividend stocks. While the past 7-year bull market has rewarded these investors, a looming correction - or worse, recession - will decimate their portfolio value. While this is often not a problem for those with the ability and foresight to hold or even accumulate shares during a downturn, retirees among us depending on dividend income and drawing down their portfolios with small but regular equity sales could be hurt by ensuing dividend cuts and heavy losses in market value. Even worse, those less experienced among us that will "panic sell" at market bottom will be crushed. Selling cash-secured put options can be a backdoor way into converting equity into a CD-like investment. While this type of move is certainly NOT risk-free like a certificate of deposit, it can be fairly low-risk - certainly lower risk than investing directly into equities at market price. What I am most interested in is the June 16, 2017 put options chain for Apple, Inc. Because Apple stock has been hammered so much as of late, long-term puts have seen significant premium gains. The $70 put for Apple, Inc. is currently trading with a premium of about $3.30. That means for a single $7,000 contact, the seller of this option is given an up-front premium of $330, or an immediate 4.7% return. Annualized, that return is 4.25%. For those among us who are growth-oriented, a 4.25% annualized return may seem like peanuts. However, this may be interesting to the more risk averse "fixed income" investors among us because the $70 strike price is a whopping 24.5% below Apple's current market value. Apple, Inc. has already fallen over 30% from its 52-week high of $132.97/share. As a result, Apple's downside is somewhat limited and the chances of the stock falling another 24.5% within the next 405 calendar days is low. The chances of this contract being "put" upon the seller is unlikely. As a result, selling this put is almost like taking out a certificate of deposit. What a hypothetical investor will be doing is effectively committing to lock away $7,000 into their brokerage account and not touch it for the next 405 calendar days for a guaranteed 4.25% annualized return in the form of a premium (less brokerage commissions), a rate historically competitive with certificates of deposit, and nearly 20 times higher than the current average national rate for 12-month CDs <$100,000.00. This trade comes with a significant bonus: with a certificate of deposit the investor must wait until maturity to collect the interest income, but when a Put option is sold, the income is collected up-front. This income can be used to lower your cost basis of the trade itself, or it can be withdrawn and used immediately as the investor sees fit. This is not a risk-free trade, and there is certainly a possibility that the contract will be "put" upon the investor. The worst-case scenario is as follows: 100 shares of Apple, Inc. stock will be put upon the contract seller at a price of $7,000 (commissions have been omitted for simplicity). This will happen regardless of what Apple's stock price falls to. It could fall to $69.99/share or $9.99/share, but the contract owner must buy it at $70.00/share. This is the inherent risk of selling puts, and this should only be done by investors who will be happy owning Apple stock at $70/share regardless of market conditions, and have the cash available to hold in their brokerage account for the entire duration of the contract without touching it to cover a potential contract enforcement. If the put contract is exercised, based on current earnings data, the contract holder will own 100 shares of Apple, Inc. stock at: P/E Ratio (based on current ttm earnings): 7.8x Dividend Yield (based on current $2.28 annual dividend): 3.25% In the event the stock is put upon the contract holder, assuming no changes to Apple's earnings and dividend, they will own Apple stock at an obscenely low 7.8x P/E with a yield of 3.25%. If Apple increases earnings and raises their dividend YoY - which is likely at a payout ratio of only 25.33% - valuations only get better for the new equity holder. In my opinion, this is still an outstanding outcome, and I would personally be thrilled if this "worst case scenario" occurred in my personal portfolio. The 3.25% yield is still nearly 15 times higher than the average current 12-month CD rate, and investing in Apple today at $70/share, again in my opinion, would be such an obscene value play I would beg to keep it in my long-term portfolio while collecting a dividend that fat.
