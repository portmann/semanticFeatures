Apple: Why I'm Ignoring Opening Weekend iPhone Sales - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Everyone will want to dissect this weekend's iPhone sales numbers. Could Pope Francis' visit impact sales? Last week, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) stated that initial iPhone sales were on pace to top last year's first weekend sales record. With the phone being available this Friday, investors and analysts will be listening next Monday to see how the opening weekend went. I don't believe we should read too much into any figure(s) Apple releases, as this year's period is much different than last year's. Today, I'll provide some reasons why I'm ignoring any opening weekend sales data. This truly is an apples to oranges comparison. Last year's pre-order period went from September 12th to September 18th, while this year's pre-order period goes from the 12th to the 24th. Additionally, the iPhone is available for pre-order and delivery on day one in China where last year that country had to wait about a month for the phone. Chinese sales may be pulled forward a bit, so unless Apple releases information on how that country's sales compared to the similar October 2014 period, data may be completely useless. Also, Apple is embarking on a slightly different strategy in certain US states this year. In states without a sales tax, of which there are five (but Montana doesn't have any Apple stores), customers must have a reservation to buy an iPhone on launch day. Apple is changing its strategy to reduce the impact of "sharks," or phone brokers who buy unlocked phones and ship them to global locations where the phones are in short supply (to make a profit). In US states with no sales tax, these phones are obviously cheaper, so the sharks can make more of a profit. Apple is trying to eliminate this practice, but it might result in a slight reduction of opening weekend sales. There has been a lot of attention on Pope Francis' visit to the US. In recent days, there has been a large discussion about his visit impacting iPhone sales . Some couriers, such as UPS (NYSE: UPS ), are warning customers about impacted deliveries in New York and Philadelphia later this week due to very tight security. This could mean that people who pre-ordered the phone may not get it on day one. However, the larger impact may be for those looking to buy the phone on Friday and Saturday. If couriers like UPS can't make their deliveries, some of Apple's retail stores may not get as much supply as hoped, which would limit potential sales this weekend. Also, road closures and other traffic nightmares might keep consumers from heading out to Apple or other retail stores. It might be a lot easier to wait until next week than to fight massive traffic delays just to get the phone a few days earlier. One item that seems to be lost in all of this discussion is Apple's fiscal calendar . The company's fiscal Q4 period ends this Saturday, September 26th. That means that any sales that come on Sunday would be in the holiday fiscal Q1 period, not during fiscal Q4. So while Apple may release sales through the opening weekend, part of that weekend isn't a factor in the quarter to be reported in October. When combined with the apples to oranges comparison to last year, any data we might get from Apple won't be tremendously valid. Pre-orders may be up substantially given the longer period and availability in China. Also, last year had the phone available in stores for more than a week during fiscal Q4, while this year has just a couple of days. One of the reasons why Apple shares have been hit hard recently is the fears over slowing growth in China, which is Apple's fastest growing region. Interestingly enough, this year's launch will create an interesting dynamic since a few million iPhone sales should be pulled forward into fiscal Q4. In last year's fiscal Q4 period , Apple reported $5.778 billion in Greater China revenues, up just 1% over the prior year period. In the next three fiscal quarters, the company would report massive 70%, 71%, and 112% year-over-year sales growth for Greater China. By pulling iPhone sales forward, Apple's October earnings report should show another big jump for China. Thus, fiscal Q1 will have a harder base point for China and won't contain a launch period for the new iPhone. Thus, when we get results in January, don't be surprised if the China growth number is not very impressive. Overall, the China situation and opening weekend sales represent the short-term view over Apple. In the grand scheme of things, how important are a few days of sales? Apple could announce somewhere around 11 million iPhone sales, for instance, but this is a company that is getting close to selling 250 million phones annually. In the end, the opening weekend is only likely to represent 4% or 5% of yearly sales, so keep that in perspective. Back in June, I detailed how improvement for iOS 9 would be the key to Apple's developer conference . Apple needed to make the operating system more efficient, provide a more stabile platform and help with battery life. It appears that Apple has done well as Apple has recently announced that iOS 9 is off to a tremendous start with more than 50% of devices already being upgraded . A better operating system combined with big upgrades to memory, the cameras and the addition of Force Touch are the real keys to the long-term success of the 6S and 6S Plus. Early reviews rolling in are quite positive , including Walt Mossberg saying that "the pressure sensitive screen looks like a game changer." Apple significantly upgraded the hardware of the iPhone this year and made a big jump with its mobile operating system. Plus, you now have the iPhone 6 available at a discounted price with its preferred larger screen. A number of analysts think Street estimates for the iPhone are way too low as the overall consensus is that iPhone revenues for fiscal 2016 will be flat. On Tuesday, Goldman Sachs issued a positive note on Apple, calling for 6% iPhone revenue growth. The analyst pointed out that the iPhone installed base is up 32% year-over-year, and the model shows a 90% correlation between the growth in the installed base and growth in upgrades. The analyst assumed coverage with a $163 price target based on potential upside in the iPhone and iPad. With the Street being flat on the iPhone for fiscal 2016, any growth could lead to decent upside for shares. I recently detailed how analyst estimates for the period seemed to imply almost no earnings growth. The iPhone is a very high margin product, especially with Apple pushing users to the more expensive, higher storage capacity models. If the company can get iPhone growth in the low to mid single digits, percentage wise, I think blowing past $10 in EPS will happen, leading to upside for this undervalued stock. Some of these issues may seem rather small on their own, but pieced together may provide just enough of an impact to be meaningful. Currently, Apple analysts expect $50.95 billion in fiscal Q4 revenues, just below the top end of the company's guidance range. With estimates this high, even the smallest sales disruption could be the difference between making and missing estimates. Plus, if Monday's data appears positive at first blush and analysts rush to raise their numbers, expectations could be way too high going into the earnings report. When you also factor in the end of the fiscal quarter, I don't think any data we get from Apple will be that meaningful unless Apple breaks down the numbers in large detail. Given how management has been very tight-lipped about certain numbers in the past, I don't expect this to be the case. There are just too many differences between last year's launch and this year's, which is why I'm going to ignore any data we get from Apple next week.
