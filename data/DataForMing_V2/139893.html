Why I Am Not Discouraged By Yahoo! - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha YHOO has traded lower and underperformed BABA leading up to its spinoff. YHOO's components excluding BABA are worth far more than its current market cap excluding BABA. It's no secret that I think Yahoo! (NASDAQ: YHOO ) is a value investment for the decade, but as it continues to trade lower I have received many emails regarding my level of concern, and whether I still consider it a good buy. Personally, I tell everyone that I hope Yahoo continues to underpeform Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) over the next three months, or until its 15% stake of Alibaba is divested into Aabaco Holdings. Here's why. Since my last article, Alibaba shares have fallen 4.78% versus 6.67% for Yahoo, a near 2% differential. While that doesn't seem like much, it is, and that's because so much of Yahoo's market capitalization is tied to Alibaba. So, for every percentage point that Yahoo underperforms Alibaba, more of its market capitalization becomes tied to Yahoo. Then, those other components that make up Yahoo become more valuable as well. For example, Yahoo's 15% stake of Alibaba is now worth about $30 billion. This is equivalent to 87% of Yahoo, thereby leaving about $4.5 billion for the remainder of Yahoo's valuation excluding its Alibaba stake. So, if Aabaco Holdings were established today, Yahoo would trade with a market capitalization of just $4.5 billion. On a percentage basis, Alibaba now accounts for more of Yahoo than at any point before, up from 75% in late March and 85% a month ago. That said, the value of Yahoo's other components remain unchanged. Yahoo has $7 billion in cash, its 35% stake of Yahoo Japan is worth $8.8 billion, and then there's Yahoo's core existing business. While the latter valuation remains a debate, I tend to think Yahoo core is worth way more than most give it credit for. Specifically, Yahoo's core operations are a story of two different businesses, strong and weak. The weak includes traditional PC advertising and display. However, the strong includes mobile and Yahoo's MaVeNS business (mobile, video, native advertising, and social). Overall revenue during Yahoo's last quarter was flat, but its MaVeNS revenue jumped 60% to $399 million to represent 35% of Yahoo's traffic-driven GAAP revenue during the second quarter. Then, its mobile revenue grew 54% to $252 million in GAAP revenue. The point is that Yahoo has fast-growing assets that I would deem as high-value. If these assets were spunoff with 50% to 60% growth, there's a good chance it would demand the same premium multiple as companies like Tableau (NYSE: DATA ) or FireEye (NASDAQ: FEYE ), potentially making it a $8 to $15 billion company. Yet, because these fast-growing assets are combined with Yahoo's weak businesses, most analysts peg Yahoo's core business at $5 to $8 billion. The good news is that by next year, these stronger businesses should be large enough to produce overall revenue growth, as we have already seen Yahoo's overall revenue flatten year-over-year. Nonetheless, even if we assume that Yahoo's core business is worth $5 billion, that still exceeds the market capitalization value that remains after Alibaba is excluded. Beyond that, Yahoo's cash and stake in Yahoo Japan is completely unaccounted for. Those two assets alone are worth nearly $16 billion. With that said, it's not very difficult to identify the upside and value in Yahoo once you understand a few key points. 1) There are $16 billion of assets completely unaccounted for. Yahoo has a $35 billion market capitalization: $5 billion for Yahoo core and $30 billion for Alibaba. Yahoo! Japan (nearly $9 billion) and its cash ($7 billion) are nowhere to be found. 2) If Yahoo were to spinoff its Alibaba stake today, its new market capitalization would be $5 billion. The new Yahoo would still own those $16 billion in accounted for assets. 3) Clearly, those unaccounted for assets are far more valuable to Yahoo after the spinoff as a $5 billion company than they are today with the company having a $35 billion market capitalization. Once more, Yahoo will retain all of those assets, not Aabaco Holdings. With the above things considered, I personally hope that Yahoo's stock trades stagnant or underperforms Alibaba leading up to the spinoff. I believe there will be more value unlocked for shareholders afterwards due to the value of Yahoo's cash and Yahoo! Japan stake relative to the company's market capitalization both now and post-Aabaco Holdings. However, the big question remains of how exactly Yahoo will use those assets to unlock shareholder value? After all, something is only worth what someone will pay for it, and right now, the market is not valuing Yahoo's cash position or its stake in Yahoo Japan. Albeit, Yahoo has a $2.5 billion buyback program. Buybacks help support the stock, create buying pressure, and drive EPS higher. I recently explained the effects of big buybacks using Yahoo as an example, and the effect that buybacks can have on a stock price. In my opinion, Yahoo has more incentive to buyback stock after the spinoff when its market capitalization is less, as it can buyback more stock as a percentage of its market capitalization, thereby creating more buying pressure in the stock. This is one way that Yahoo can put that cash to work, and realize its value. In regards to the Yahoo! Japan stake: I think Yahoo can realize its value very much like it did with Alibaba, a spinoff or another type of divestment. While Yahoo's stock is down significantly over the last year, it is still higher by 165% over the last five years. This has occurred without growth, and has been largely tied to the soaring valuation of Alibaba. Right now, all eyes are on Alibaba, but once divested, I think those eyes shift to Yahoo Japan and it ultimately drives Yahoo's stock higher much like Alibaba did. In fact, it might have an even bigger effect on Yahoo's stock. After all, Yahoo will only be a $5 billion company after it spins off Alibaba. With that said, the most important question now is why Yahoo is trading with a near 30% stock loss this year if it has so much unaccounted for value? In my opinion, the reason for Yahoo's underperformance can be traced back to two big things: The decline in Chinese equity markets and the potential IRS risk. Due to the high percentage of Yahoo's current market capitalization that is tied to Alibaba, it is essentially a Chinese company, and the selloff in Chinese equities is not helping its stock price. The second problem is fear that the IRS will reject the spinoff. Bloomberg reported several months ago an IRS official's statement regarding the potential pause to spinoff of trades or businesses that are small compared to a company's other assets. Investors have naturally assumed that this is aimed towards Yahoo, and to make matters worse, Yahoo did disclose that the IRS's decision with making its ruling could affect the tax-free status or reject the spinoff all together. Personally, I don't think this will happen for two reasons: First, Yahoo is including its Small Business unit to prevent any possible refusal and the IRS is going to receive just as much money from the divestment once shareholders sell their stake as it would from Yahoo. In other words, it's not as if the government is losing anything by Yahoo spinning off Alibaba in a tax-free manner. Therefore, with just $4.4 billion in market capitalization remaining for the valuation of Yahoo excluding Alibaba I think that much of this IRS-related fear is already priced into the stock. So, if by some chance the IRS were to prevent the spinoff, I think the stock effect would be minimal, and that Yahoo would be quick to recover due to the realization that it still owns 15% of Alibaba. In the more likely event that the spinoff receives IRS Ruling, then shares look poised for very large gains in preparation of and after the spinoff. With that said, there are many ways to play Yahoo. Investors can buy now, can wait until after the spinoff is complete, wait until after the ruling, etc. I have explained my strategy to subscribers of Tipping the Scale, my way to minimize risk and maximize the reward. Nevertheless, one thing's for certain: Even in a worst case scenario, Yahoo still owns 15% of Alibaba, that investment will be divested, and Yahoo's assets excluding Alibaba are very undervalued. Personally, I am a big believer in the notion that 1+1=2, and in the case of Yahoo, the value of all its parts well exceeds its current market capitalization. And, I believe that sooner or later, that value will reflect in the market capitalization of Yahoo, whether its before the spinoff or after, nobody knows. Source: Why I Am Not Discouraged By Yahoo!
