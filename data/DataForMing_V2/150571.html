'Star Wars' land coming to Disney's California, Florida parks | Reuters Anaheim, Calif. Walt Disney Co said on Saturday that it is developing two 14-acre "Star Wars" lands with rides and attractions at its Anaheim, California and Orlando, Florida theme parks. The expansion will be the largest themed land in the parks, Chief Executive and Chairman Bob Iger said at Disney's annual D23 Exposition, taking place across from Disneyland in Anaheim. The "Star Wars" land will feature a new planet from George Lucas' sci-fi intergalactic universe, and two rides including one where attendees will be able to take control of the Millennium Falcon spaceship. Iger also said the Cantina, the infamous hub of rogue smugglers and traders in the films, will be part of the new land's entertainment. The announcement comes as fans of "Star Wars" gear up for the first installment of a new trilogy of films, kicking off in December with the release of J.J. Abrams' "The Force Awakens." "We wanted characters to come alive not on screen, but in real life," Iger said. A date for the opening of the new attractions was not given.
