As OneNewsNow reports, an attorney representing laid-off Disney workers claims the Fortune 500 company broke federal laws when it replaced them with immigrants. Attorney Sara Blackwell filed a federal lawsuit this week on behalf of two former tech employees of Disney after the corporation hired H-1B visa recipients from overseas. The employees were among approximately 250 laid off approximately a year ago, and some of them have filed complaints with the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission, The Orlando Sentinel reported. Blackwell tells OneNewsNow she is accusing Disney of violating Title VII, which bans discrimination under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The lawsuit also accuses Disney of RICO-like violations, claiming it colluded with two hiring firms to misrepresent hiring plans in visa paperwork.  If a judge dismisses the lawsuit, Blackwell says, "I have 31 other plaintiffs that I can bring. It's not going to stop me." Disney said in a statement that the lawsuits are "based on an unsustainable legal theory and are a misrepresentation of the facts."

You think fluoride rots your brain?  Do that ride 5 times in a row and talk to me about brain rot afterwards, if you are even capable of speaking any more. Or maybe it's just because Mickey touched me somewhere he shouldn't have when I was a kid.  Could be either.  Don't know.  Still a fun place to take the family.  Enjoy.

Didn't do any good. So Friday I went back for the follow-up and he asked me if I used the suppositories he gave me. I said I did. I also told him for all the good they did me I might as well have stuck 'em up my ass...

Turns out, they're just more croney-capitalist scum. Sat, 01/30/2016 - 18:38 | 7119291 silverer I never went back after ordering a Coke in Cinderella's castle and it was a tap Coke that smelled like sulfur.  That really popped my Disney bubble.  My Mom lived in Orlando, and that sulfur smell could totally be taken out with a charcoal filter. So multi-billion Disney too cheap to put a charcoal filter in their water line to their Coke machine, or simply serve you bottled Coke. Sat, 01/30/2016 - 18:05 | 7119169 Miffed Microbio... Disneyland was a great place to take when our kids were little. When they decided to go PC, we stopped going. Even our children could see the ludicrousness of a pirate chasing a maiden for a plate of food.

They could call it Refugees of the Caribbean. What an attraction that would be-and still politically correct!

Disney is what it has always been a profit seeking company selling a fantasy while itself firmly rooted in cold hard reality. They would herd children over a cliff to boost the bottom line. They do in a way, over a cliff into a world of dull witted obesity of simple carbohydrate fuelled hyperactivity syndrome. Disney obviously doesn't percieve any obligation to contributing to its home team's financial wealth.  Oops, isn't that where the guests come from?
