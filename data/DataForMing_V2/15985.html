Disney's A Great Stock... For The Right Investors - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha The Walt Disney Company is one of the largest and most successful businesses on Earth, with strong diversification and a phenomenal operating history. Even Warren Buffett claimed that, after selling the stock after a year of holding it for a 50% gain, was a major mistake of his. However, just because a company is great doesn't mean that the business is right for every investor. With a high trading multiple, this is especially true of Disney. There's no denying that The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS ) is one of the greatest companies on Earth. With a market cap of $180.9 billion, the entertainment giant is one of the largest and has had an amazing success story that's too good for even a fairy tale princess to believe. Given the company's past performance, it's hard to imagine that very long-term investors will lose money betting on its future but does this mean that its shares are suited for all investors? Some years ago , Warren Buffett claimed that one of his biggest investment mistakes involved shares of Disney. Back in 1965, Buffett met Walt Disney himself, just one year before the latter's untimely death. At the time, the company had just experienced tremendous success with its release of Mary Poppins, had no debt on its books and was in the process of installing its Pirates of the Caribbean ride at a cost of $17 million. However, because the company didn't have any major films in its pipeline, the entire enterprise was being valued by Mr. Market at $80 million. After seeing the opportunity the company presented, Buffett decided to buy up 5% of the business for $4 million. Instead of holding it, though, he sold his stake a year later for $6 million for a total gain of 50%; not bad for a one-year holding. Had he kept hold of his shares in the business, however, the shares would be worth just over $9 billion, excluding all dividends paid during that timeframe. Again, excluding dividends paid out, that would have meant an almost 17% return per annum for a period of 50 years. Fast forward to today and Disney has seen a series of transformations. As of 2013 , 9 of the top 10 and 11 of the top 25 theme parks (as measured by attendance) globally bear the Disney name on them as do 2 of the top 5 water parks, with all parks hosting over 132.5 million per year and growing; the company generates 43% of its revenue from its Media Networks segment, which owns 80% of ESPN, 50% of the A&E Television Network, and 100% of both ABC Family and Disney Channels; it generates sales from selling toys, video games, and still has a large presence in the movie industry through both its own original content and through big-name acquisitions like Pixar and Lucasfilm (the Star Wars studio). Surely, the list of companies that have the kind of reach and prestige championed by Disney can fit on a post-it note. If you buy and hold shares of Disney for the next 20 years, odds are that you'll make some decent money but if you're looking for companies with tremendous upside, Disney may not be the one for you. Yes, the business is phenomenal in many ways but in order to get a piece of the action, investors are having to cough up some serious cash. A look at the table below should illustrate just how pricey an investment in the business is: Currently, shares of Disney are trading at a hefty 25 times 2014's earnings. With the success of Frozen, plans for a sequel in place and plans for a new Star Wars Trilogy, it's clear that investors are optimistic about the firm's prospects but asking investors to pay such a high multiple for a large business might be a bit of a stretch. Looking at free cash flow, the picture is even worse. Using 2014's metrics yet again, shares of Disney are trading at a multiple of 28. Admittedly, this is assuming that all of its $3.31 billion (soon to be $4.8 billion in 2015) in capital expenditures are necessary for the maintenance of the company as opposed to growth but even if you assume that maintenance capex is half the actual amount then shares are still at a multiple of 22. This appears to be more reasonable but still should not relay to investors the idea that Disney is a value prospect by any means. Moving forward, it's likely that Disney's success will be astounding and it's probably even more likely that the company's shareholders will see attractive, safe returns in their portfolios but this doesn't mean that the company's shares are for everybody. For investors seeking outsized returns, Disney is probably not the way to go at the moment since the larger a company becomes, the more difficult it becomes to grow at a quick pace. Rather, buying shares of Disney (at its current price at least) should be for investors who want a strong, safe holding in their portfolio; one that will give strong performance over a period of decades instead of weeks, months, or a few years.
