Apple Falls... And Lands In My Dividend Growth Portfolio - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha A pullback on the price of AAPL shares led to serious due diligence and, ultimately, a purchase. There are theories aplenty about what's "wrong" with Apple, but I found the numbers too compelling to resist. Although Apple yields less than 2%, it has the look of an eventual Dividend Aristocrat. Researching Apple gave me a nice respite from dealing with Kinder Morgan, a somewhat controversial company that has a large presence in my portfolio. In article last week, I asked: "How Much Kinder Morgan Is Too Much For A Dividend Growth Investor?" Since then, I practically have been on full-time Kinder Morgan (NYSE: KMI ) watch. First, I have had to respond to the hundreds of comments I have received. Then, I have devoted significant time in the comment stream of Ted Fischer's KMI article, " Avoiding The Endowment Effect: Should Mike Sell?" All the while, I've been trying to decide how much of the gas/oil pipeline company's stock I want in my portfolio. The little bit of time I haven't have KMI on the brain, I have been looking for good investing opportunities. I am considering topping off my positions of biopharmaceuticals Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN ) and Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ: GILD ), initiating Industrials such as United Technologies (NYSE: UTX ), Union Pacific (NYSE: UNP ) and Honeywell (NYSE: HON ), and adding to my Big Oil holdings Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM ) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX ). I also am following the labor dispute at Verizon (NYSE: VZ ); the Aug. 1 deadline passed without an agreement, but workers have yet to strike. Others fairly high on my watch list include Costco (NASDAQ: COST ), Hershey (NYSE: HSY ), Ventas (NYSE: VTR ) and T. Rowe Price (NASDAQ: TROW ). I even have been looking into non-dividend-paying Express Scripts (NASDAQ: ESRX ) as a possible growth play. What I hadn't been looking at was Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), which only two weeks ago nearly hit its all-time high. Sure, I knew that the consumer tech giant was a great company, and I knew that many observers considered it a good value despite its 144% run-up since September 2013. Still, for one reason or another, I always seemed to find "a better fit" for my portfolio. Given that I generally follow the Dividend Growth Investing strategy, Apple's sub-2% yield certainly factored into my lack of interest. When AAPL's price went from a mid-day high of $132.92 on July 21 to a mid-day low of $121.99 on July 22, I made a mental note to check it out. Before I did any checking, however, it quickly climbed back over $125. Its gradual drifting down into the $121-$122 range over the next several sessions didn't take my mind off of KMI or my other investing concerns. Then, after reaching $122.57 early Monday, AAPL quickly fell more than $5. It hit $117.52 before moving back up and closing at $118.44. That definitely piqued my interest and sent me into DDM -- due diligence mode. Why is this happening? How does the valuation look now? How does it compare to other companies I'm considering? Should I be moving it up on my watch list, perhaps all the way up to the very top? Theories about "Why is this happening?" include: Despite growing earnings by 45% and revenues by 33% in the third fiscal quarter of 2015, the July 21 earnings report disappointed many analysts. Apple sold a record 47.5 million iPhones during the quarter, but analysts expected 50 million-plus. (Jeesh, there's no pleasing some people!) Not quite enough recent innovation, as the Apple Watch wasn't the mega-hit the company hoped it would be and Apple Music mostly elicited either yawns or derision. The so-called "Dow Effect," whereby a company's share price tends to fall after it enters the Dow Jones Industrial Average, as Apple did in March. Dana Blankenhorn says it has made AAPL "ridiculously cheap." Over-reliance on the iPhone as a profit driver; it accounts for nearly three-quarters of Apple's revenue. Paulo Santos doubts the company will "get a bump" when iPhone 6s is released soon. A combination of a "self-fulfilling prophecy," with the anti-Apple faction having the upper hand right now, and ridiculous expectations, as discussed in Mark Hibben's "Apple: The Market's False Correction." AAPL's price breaking through the 200-day moving average. This led those who rely on technical charts to wonder how low the stock price could go. Could there be another 2012-13-style collapse? Despite all that information (some might call it "noise"), I remained interested in the possibility of buying a blue-chip company at a deep discount. So before hitting the sack Monday night, I went looking for relevant numbers. Here are some of the numbers I found: $118.44 -- Price at Monday's market close, AAPL's lowest session-ending price since Jan. 30. (It closed at $114.64 Tuesday.) 15.4% -- Discount to Morningstar's Fair Value Estimate of $140. 29.3% -- Discount to S&P Capital IQ's Fair Value Calculation of $167.60. 21.0% -- Discount to S&P Capital IQ's 12-Mo. Target Price of $150. 21% to 42% -- Discount to Value Line's Target Price Range, projecting Apple to reach $150-$200 within three to five years. 0.69 -- Value Line's Relative P/E ratio. (Current price/earnings ratio divided by the median P/E for all stocks under VL review. Below 1.00 indicates undervalued compared to the overall market.) 2 -- Value Line's Safety score. (I strongly favor 1s and 2s.) 13.7 -- P/E ratio, lower than AAPL's 5-year average (14.1) and the current industry average (14.7). 37 -- Number of times Apple beat earnings estimates out of the last 40 quarters dating back to 2005. 10 out of 11 -- Years of EPS growth, and this year almost surely will make it 11 out of 12. 37.3% -- Amount the dividend has grown since it was instituted three years ago. $202.8 Billion -- Apple's reported cash on hand. (Wow! That's twice as much cash as I have!) 1 -- Panelist Eddie Herring chose Apple as his No. 1 stock for a three-part series I wrote this past spring. Dozens and dozens of commenters applauded the selection. As I worked up Apple's numbers (and those of the other companies I was considering), I found that Apple was the only dividend-payer on my watch list showing a double-digit discount to Morningstar's FVE and both S&P Capital IQ figures. And so I decided it finally was time to take a bite out of Apple. (Disclosure: In December, I had bought 5.040 shares of AAPL for the Dividend Growth 50 project.) If the price had taken off at Tuesday's open, I would have held off; if it retreated, I would pounce. I set my limit order at just over $115, and it executed at 9:59 a.m. Before too long, it moved down to $113.25. Now, I know it's impossible to call an exact bottom... but it's always a little disappointing to see the price of any stock go down 2 freakin' bucks within an hour after purchase, isn't it?!?! AAPL's price ended Tuesday fairly close to where I bought it. Before I submitted this article around noon Wednesday, Apple shares had plunged to about $112 and then reversed course, zooming back over $117. I'm strapped in, fully prepared for a wild ride. All of this short-term action won't matter one bit in the big picture, anyway. I plan to hold AAPL for years, adding to the position through purchases and dividend reinvestment along the way. Overall, I'm pretty darn happy to have bought this AA+ rated powerhouse at about 13 times projected 2015 earnings. With Apple having so much cash on hand, a 22% payout ratio, consistently excellent earnings and a recent history of double-digit dividend hikes, this DGI guy is as excited about the company's potential income growth as I am about its prospects for capital gains. Well, I'm still thinking about what I am going to do with the largest income-producing stock I own. I know y'all are on the edge of your seats (that's sarcasm, folks!), and I promise I will write an article as soon as I determine the fate of KMI in my portfolio. In the meantime, it sure was nice that a shiny new toy was able to Keep Mike Involved in something else for a day or two. Source: Apple Falls...
