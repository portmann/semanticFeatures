NYC criticizes slow Verizon fiber rollout - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha Jun 17 2015, 20:12 ET | About: Verizon Communications (VZ) | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor In an audit that New York City plans to release tomorrow, the city slams Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) for failing to deliver FiOS fiber connections to anyone who wanted them, a promise the company made in 2008. In signing a franchise agreement with NYC then, Verizon said all comers would be served by 2014 -- but there are more than 40K requests for service and about three-quarters of those have been outstanding for 12 months or longer, according to the audit. Lowell McAdam's ascension to the CEO role four years ago has seen the company focus on its wireless operations, and sell off wireline assets in three states as well as stop plans to build FiOS in new territories. A Verizon spokesman says the company's invested $3.5B in the city's FiOS network and that Verizon and the city both want more people on it. He said the audit appeared to be politically based, linked to the city's upcoming union negotiations.

As a shareholder, I wonder how many other shareholders would prefer VZ keeps their eyes on the ball and doesn't make the mistake so many others have when buying up so called premium properties.   I don't know about you, however I can say that I don't know anyone who uses the AOL portal for their news or other content. Anyone want to recall T's fun when they purchased Prodigy services? The Prodigy debacle was a bit like Warner Communications buying Atari. In August 2014, Comscore ranked AOL.com as the 4th most visited site of multi-platform properties.  181M monthly unique visitors.  Business Insider(Feb 6, 2014); stated AOL had 120M unique visitors per month. At the end of the day, we're talking about a 4.4B deal.  A drop in the bucket.  120-180M unique visitors per month?  I personally can't quantify it, nor monetize it, but apparently a lot of folks still access news/media through aol. Straton - VZ needs to evolve in a highly competitive market  where their margins are being pinched. Aol acquisition is a good start and will allow them to leverage their existing advantages to diversify into new areas where better opportunities. Good for VZ for  being proactive in a tough telecom pricing environment.
