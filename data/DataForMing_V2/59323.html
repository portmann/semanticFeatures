Accessories for Apple's HomeKit to hit stores next month | Reuters The first batch of home automation accessories, such as thermostats and garage door openers, compatible with Apple Incâ€™s software platform will go on sale in June, the tech company said Thursday. HomeKit is a set of tools in Appleâ€™s iOS 8 software designed to work with smart home devices. The company announced the home automation platform at its conference for developers last year, but devices compatible with the software have yet to appear in stores. â€œHomeKit has been available for just a few months and we already have dozens of partners who have committed to bringing HomeKit accessories to market and weâ€™re looking forward to the first ones coming next month,â€? Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said in a statement. Apple did not specify where the accessories would be sold. Appleâ€™s statement followed a report from Fortune that the first HomeKit enabled devices would not be available until August or September.
