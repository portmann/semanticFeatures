Verizon Communications Is A Buy - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha Latest quarterly results point to steady growth despite ongoing price war. Verizon is significantly undervalued to its average price to earnings, and I believe there is quite a bit of upside in this blue-chip company. As I've written on a few occasions lately, I believe that telecoms offer good value right now. There are a few varying reasons for this. For example, high capital expenditure due to 4G network buildouts across the developed world has led to more debt and, in turn, to lower valuations. In the case of Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ ), last year the company made a large issuance of corporate bonds in order to buy back a 49% share of Verizon Wireless. In addition, Verizon recently acquired AOL Inc. for $2.5 billion. Acquisitions of non-telecom companies have been more commonplace among carriers these days. The developed world is transitioning to a 'multi-platform' world, where the lines are blurring between communication, data and video. This explains why Verizon acquired AOL Inc and why AT&T (NYSE: T ) is acquiring DirecTV. A one-year chart for AT&T and Verizon Communications (in dark green), courtesy of Yahoo! Finance. Both AT&T and Verizon are down on the year, but Verizon is currently down more. Verizon is also significantly undervalued to its average valuation, and I believe that makes Verizon a good buy right now. This article focuses on Verizon's valuation, its dividend and its current business prospects. Like the other big US telecoms, Verizon divides its business into two segments: Wireless and wireline. Wireless has been out performing wireline. Last quarter, overall revenue grew by a healthy 3.8% year-on-year, and I do not believe that to be an anomaly: Customers are consuming more and more mobile data, and Verizon has done well in converting that use to increased revenue per account and higher EBITDA. Last quarter, average revenue per account hopped up another 1.5% year-over-year. Wireline revenue was down 2.9% overall, with a 1.1% decline in EBITDA from this segment, but Verizon's cable and broadband service, FiOS, continues to do quite well. Revenue from the 'mass market' segment of wireline was up 4.0% thanks to continued subscriber growth in FiOS. According to data from FAST Graphs, the street expects earnings growth of 14% in 2015 and another 3% the year after. Those numbers are subject to revision, particularly those for 2016. Even still, this shows the solid growth potential which Verizon has. If you measure dividend safety by the dividends to earnings per share ratio, Verizon comes out looking good. Dividends are only 64% of 2014 earnings. However, free cash flow is usually the better metric, and in this case, the dividends to free cash flow ratio tells a very different story. Over the past twelve months Verizon has generated $7.26 billion in FCF, but paid $8.44 billion in dividends. Why the discrepancy? Outsized capital expenditure explains everything. Over the last twelve months Verizon allocated $26 billion to capital expenditure. Over the last five years Verizon has averaged capital expenditure of around $17 billion per year, and I suspect that Verizon will return to a more normal capex regiment once the buildout in 4G and broadband begins to wind down (whenever that is). This would bring the dividend to free cash flow ratio close to the dividend to EPS ratio. In the long run, I believe the dividend is still very secure. FAST Graphs chart of Verizon Communications. Solid blue line represents average price to earnings ratio. Earnings represented by dark green shaded area bounded by orange line. Over the last twenty years Verizon has averaged a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 16.2 times. That number edges down to 15.8 times when looking at the ten-year average. But right now Verizon trades at just 13.2 times earnings; a 16.5% discount to Verizon's average ten-year valuation. All things considered, I believe this makes Verizon a buy with substantial upside and a 4.6% dividend to boot. I believe that Verizon offers perhaps the best value among telecoms at this time. In my opinion, here's what you'll get with an investment in Verizon: A generous and secure dividend that should grow a bit faster than inflation, a best-of-breed telecom riding the wave of increased data use, and the potential for a good bit of capital appreciation. Verizon is a solid buy at this time. Source: Verizon Communications Is A Buy Disclosure: I am/we are long VZ. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
