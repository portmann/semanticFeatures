Earnings Call Highlights What I Like About Apple: Services - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. Apple just reported its strongest financial results ever. The company generated $75.9 billion during the December quarter. The theme on the earnings call I wanted to highlight is the service business. The key take away for me from Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) earnings call is the healthy growth of its service business. The Q1 2016 revenue from this segment is up 24% against the same quarter last year to $5.5 billion. This continues a trend because over full fiscal 2015 service revenue equaled $19.9 billion, up 23% compared to the prior full fiscal year. The reason I'm much more interested in the service part of the equation is because I have my doubts about the ultimate durability of their unparalleled success with devices. However, this is now a consensus opinion and I'm not the only one with this concern. Tim Cook specifically acknowledged investor concern regarding the recurring nature of the firm's business. Cook called on consumer surveys by 451 Research to demonstrate Apple's durability. The firm has a 99% customer satisfaction rate for iPhone 6S and 6S Plus. iPhone loyalty is twice as strong as the next highest brand. As reassuring as Cook meant it, I think it does not address investors' concern with Apple's short product cycles adequately. History isn't rife with companies producing products with a one- or two-year product cycle that remained at the top for 10 years and beyond. Citing current customer satisfaction and loyalty rates does nothing to convince me of future customer satisfaction and loyalty rates. The exact concern is that these preferences can change so fast. If the next iteration of the iPhone is mediocre instead of top-of-the-line compared with competing products do you really believe for one second these rates will stay there? I don't. One way to help ensure a large market share for the iPhone, even in cycles when it brings out a relatively weak product, is to increase customer captivity through added services. Apple's management is acutely aware of this and because its service business is now starting to become meaningful, at the same time the device business is flagging, they took the opportunity to draw some attention to it at the earnings call. Source: Q1 2016 supplemental materials In the recent December quarter installed base service purchases reached $8.9 billion, a 24% increase YoY. When reviewing the fiscal 2015 purchase value of services these added up to $31 billion which also represents a 23% increase against the prior fiscal year. It is very important to realize the presence and power of this segment within Apple. It is implied by the forward earnings ratio of 9x that the market does not expect Apple to grow very fast from here. It didn't grow very fast this quarter to be sure, but the services growth rates are very healthy and they only take into account devices that have been installed for more than 90 days, which means that it is likely to continue its good growth for at least another quarter. At first glance it isn't very impressive the company sells services at gross margins that equal the margins it achieves on selling electronic devices. That's not something may service businesses will aspire to achieve. However, Apple's gross margins on its electronics are very good. In my opinion almost certainly unsustainably good. The gross margins on the service side will be much easier to sustain and will add to the company's ability to sustain them company wide. As long as its OS remains one of the major platforms in use, and developers can't ignore them, these margins will be easy to keep up. Margins on devices will deteriorate much faster on lower volumes or on a more diversified product portfolio. The direct impact of services on the bottom line remains limited for now. Excluding a patent settlement, the total amount the company generated with services only added up to $5.5 billion for the quarter, a 15% YoY improvement. App store revenue increased by 27% over the quarter and the number of "transacting customers" grew by 18%. Both were all-time records and together indicate customers are spending more on services and this too, among Apps and iTunes customers, reached an all-time high. The newer product lines, and less successful ones, like the Watch and TV have a lot of potential to increase service revenue. Part of the attraction of all these platforms is that Apple does not need to spend a lot to achieve higher customer spending rates on services. App developers, with a clear self-interest, work extremely hard every day to put better and better services out there that entice customers to up their spending in a win-win transaction for all involved. Especially Apple shareholders for whom this additional revenue comes at marginal cost. Apple specifically doesn't give guidance beyond the next quarter. On the call CFO Luca Maestri, perhaps unwittingly, gave a little bit of indirect insight into the future of Apple's service revenues when commenting on capex levels (emphasis mine): Then we've got data centers and data centers is a growing expenditure for us, because, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, our installed base of customers and devices is growing, and is growing very significantly. And the data center capacity that we put in place is to provide the services that are tied to the installed base. So, that type of expenditure goes together with the installed base. Indirectly, this is a form of guidance the company expects its service business to continue to grow very well for quite a bit in the future. You don't build data centers to serve next quarter's demand. You build them to serve the next five years of demand. To drive my point home I want to remind you that services contribution to the bottom line is likely to develop in a hockey stick pattern because of its marginal cost. When earnings grow like that, they are extremely easy to underestimate. Admittedly, I am pretty much an Apple bear. Although I recently wrote: Why I Was Wrong Shorting Apple . With near-term expectations for iPhone sales down and part of the consensus opinion, accompanied by the obligatory bleak future punditry, I'm switching to the position that it's important to keep in mind there is more to Apple than devices.
