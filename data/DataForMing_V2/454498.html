How Could You Invest Confidently In The Auto Industry? | Seeking Alpha Do you feel the economic recovery in the U.S.? I do! Life seems much better compared to 2008-2009. Retail sales continue to increase, unemployment rate marches down and the jobs report for June was stellar. Also, interest rates are at ultra-low levels and the consumer confidence index improved recently . In a few words, everything looks great. One may think: "With interest rates at multi-year low levels, everybody and their mothers should be buying houses and autos." We cannot deny that the demand for housing is very strong and it has caused prices to skyrocket. However, I am concerned with the auto industry and maybe so should you. According to the latest report on Auto Retail Sales from the Bureau of Economics , the number of domestic auto retail sales in June 2016 declined by almost 10% compared to June 2015 to 405,000 units. Worrisome is that this level was last seen in June 2011. Imported auto retail sales declined by 12% over the same period to 141,000 units, Figure 1. This is the lowest level since 1999, Figure 2. In other words, imported auto sales fared better in the middle of the financial crisis than today. Overall, investing in any auto manufacturer should be avoided. Nonetheless, if you want to have exposure to the auto industry to diversify your portfolio and reduce the systematic risk, I have a couple of ideas for you. General Motors (NYSE: GM ) reported an increase in retail sales by 1.2% for June on a YOY basis. However, total sales declined by 1.6%. Sales for GMC's units were down 8.6%. Ford's sales (NYSE: F ) increased by 6.4% with Ford trucks increasing the numbers of units sold by 24.2% to 96,354. Both manufacturers saw a decline in the number of cars sold. Overall, Ford seems to be the lesser of the two evils due to increasing truck sales. Therefore, the first idea is to invest in Ford over GM. It depends! I would avoid investing in Japanese auto makers because the appreciation of the yen turns Japanese products more expensive in offshore markets. It does not matter what Haruhiko Kuroda do, the yen continues to appreciate at alarming pace. Do not be surprised if Toyota (NYSE: TM ) and Nissan continue to post declining revenues in response to the yen movement. Another disadvantages of Toyota and Nissan compared to GM and Ford is that the Japanese auto makers do not have trucks to compete against the domestic auto makers. Since the number of cars sold is decreasing across the board, GM and Ford should fare better than the Japanese auto makers. Therefore, the second idea is to have a long position in Ford and a short position in Toyota to mitigate market risk. The low demand for autos is alarming despite the low interest rate environment. In general, I believe that the auto industry is not the place to invest now, but if you want to invest in an American company, you should choose Ford over GM due to increasing truck sales. Perhaps a pair trade with a long position in Ford and a short position in GM is your best bet to mitigate market risk. Also, you must avoid the Japanese auto makers until the yen losses ground against other major currencies. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
