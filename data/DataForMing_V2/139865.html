US STOCKS-Wall St rises as pvt jobs data eases rate hike worries | Reuters * Nothing decided on timing of rate hike: Fed's Powell to CNBC * Walt Disney falls after cutting cable unit profit forecast Aug 5 (Reuters) - Wall Street opened higher on Wednesday after data showed private sector hiring slowed sharply in July, indicating a loss of momentum in the economy at the start of the third quarter and tempering expectations of a September interest rate hike. The ADP National Employment Report showed private employers added 185,000 workers in July, below the 215,000 increase forecast by economists surveyed by Reuters. Weak data on private sector hiring also reduced expectations of a strong reading in the government's payrolls report due Friday. "It suggests that September is not yet a done deal as some Fed centrists are still unimpressed by the data," Standard Chartered economist Thomas Costerg said. "It seems the Fed remains entrenched in its wait-and-see mode." In other economic data, trade deficit widened in June as solid domestic demand in the second quarter and a strong dollar sucked in imports of food and automobiles. Some economists have said a bunch of soft economic data - released in the last few days - could prompt the U.S. Federal Reserve to wait until December to increase interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. The Fed has said it needs to see a sustained recovery before it raises rates for the first time in nearly a decade. Stock market investors are keeping a close eye on economic data and the Fed's statements as a rate hike would increase cost of borrowing for companies, leading to lower profits. Fed Governor Jerome Powell told CNBC on Wednesday that the central bank's policymakers had not yet decided whether to raise rates in September, adding that data on the labor market would be key to that decision.
