Disney: Killing It At The Box Office - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha In October, I presented a detailed analysis of FY 2016 Disney's Studio Segment releases and concluded the company was set for a record-breaking year at the box office. Strong out-performance from Star Wars Episode 7 and Zootopia should lead to upward revisions in FY'16 box office results. With strong offerings anchored in proven franchises set for release during the rest of FY '16, Disney should see a 28%-54% year-over-year box office growth. In October, I wrote a detailed analysis of Disney's (NYSE: DIS ) FY 2016 box office releases to compare and contrast the FY 2016 slate of releases with FY 2015. The heart of the article was a pairing of FY 2016 releases with FY 2015 analog films in terms of expected box office performance. Due to the greater number of releases and the higher level of consumer anticipation for movies such as Star Wars Episode 7 and Finding Dory, I argued that Disney's Studio Entertainment segment would see strong growth over FY '15's performance in FY '16. After the first quarter and a half of Disney's fiscal year, the extent to which the Studio Entertainment segment's box office haul should rise versus last year is beginning to take shape. And Disney investors should be pleased. Source: Data Provided by Box Office Mojo, Analysis by Author Disney has been increasingly dependent on its Studio Segment to generate above market earnings growth as its Media Networks segment slows. The performance of The Good Dinosaur, Star Wars and now Zootopia in FY '16 should lead analysts and investors to significantly increase estimates for FY 2016 Studio Entertainment segment performance. The performance in FY 2016 of these releases puts the Studio Entertainment segment on pace to grow box office receipts by approximately 30% assuming each of the remaining paired analog movies perform in-line with their 2015 counterparts. In a more aggressive analysis, which assumes sequels slated for release in FY '16 perform as well as their previous films, it's easy to see a growth of over 54% in box office in FY '16 for the House Of Mouse. The major drivers of the predicted 30% climb in Disney's box office haul in 2016 will come from the record breaking performance of Star Wars Episode 7, the addition of a second Pixar release this Fiscal Year over last year's single release and the surprise record-breaking hit of Disney Animation's Zootopia, which has so far turned in the biggest opening weekend box office gross for the company's animation studio in its history. Star Wars Episode 7 became the highest grossing domestic film of all time (not adjusted for inflation), tallying $928 million in domestic box office and over $2 billion in total. This improves on its FY '15 analog Avengers: Age of Ultron by $600 million, or approximately 43%. This will provide a considerable cushion to growth if any of the Studio Entertainment segment releases should significantly under perform. In my initial analysis in October, I paired FY'16's The Good Dinosaur with FY '15's Big Hero 6. Zootopia now seems a more apt comparison based on its performance thus far at the box office. Zootopia has dramatically outperformed Big Hero 6 in its opening weekend, grossing an average of $19,614 per theater versus Big Hero 6's $14,947 average despite being released on slightly more screens. Zootopia is also performing better internationally thus far, with slightly more of its total box office gross coming from foreign moviegoers than Big Hero 6 ended with for its total gross. Even assuming that Zootopia's box office declines at a steeper rate week over week than Big Hero 6, it is perfectly reasonable to expect the film to improve on its FY '15 analog by at least 15%. Best case scenario is that Disney Animation has produced a new animated classic with long legs that can stretch into the Easter holiday at the end of the month. Disney's studio releases for the remainder of FY '16 are each anchored in CEO Bob Iger's tentpole franchise strategy that has proven to produce strong and predictable box office returns over the past three years. Movies such as Marvel's Captain America: Civil War will easily outperform its FY'15 analog Ant-Man's $519 million gross, as will Alice Through The Looking Glass easily trounce the $212 million grossed by the FY '15 musical Into the Woods. Captain America's last release earned $714 million at the box office, while the last installment of Johnny Depp in Wonderland grossed over $1 billion. In fact, if an analysis of Disney's Studio Entertainment segment were to assume releases in FY '16 performed as well as the earlier films and not simply the analog film from FY '15 assigned to them for year-over-year comparison purposes, the Studio segment could easily tally over $6.8 billion in box office for FY '16. This would represent a 54% rise in box office year-over-year for the Studio Entertainment segment. This incredible jump is entirely possible considering the high level of anticipation for Finding Dory, Captain America: Civil War and Alice Through the Looking Glass. The potential of Disney's Studio Entertainment segment to outperform expected earnings and revenue growth in FY '16 is very strong. Even the low-end prediction of a 30% rise in box office for the segment would significantly grow revenue and earnings from the segment. Investors should be aware, however, that it is difficult to calculate the exact degree to which the Studio segment's performance will improve as the segment's results are impacted by home movie sales, video distribution deals and a sharing of some product revenue with the company's Consumer Product segment. Additionally, box office grosses are split in negotiated percentages with theater owners. Plus, it is difficult to know the production budgets of all the movies slated for release in FY '16. Investors should anticipate strong growth in Disney's Studio Entertainment segment in FY '16 as box office sales are set to soar by at least 30% and likely as much as 54% or more. Concern over the company's Media Networks business has pressured the stock in 2016 and presents the long-term investor with an attractive entry point in this must own growth name.
