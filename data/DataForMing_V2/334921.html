What Apple's Dividend Increases Will Look Like - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple plans to increase its dividend on a yearly basis. I expect its dividend to increase by about 10% per year. The company can cover its dividend comfortably with US-generated cash, but there isnâ€™t a lot left over for buybacks. At Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) shareholder meeting last week Tim Cook reiterated that it was committed to raising its dividend on an annual basis. I have been writing since December 2012 that the company would have planned to increase its dividend on a yearly basis when it presented the plan to the Board. Since Apple began its dividend program in the September 2012 quarter it has paid out $38.7 billion in dividends of which $2.97 billion was in the December 2015 quarter. Apple restarted paying dividends in the September 2012 quarter (it paid a dividend from May 1987 to November 1995) at a rate of $1.51 per year which increased: 15.1% to $1.74 per year in the June 2013 quarter 7.9% to $1.88 per year in the June 2014 quarter 10.6% to $2.08 per year in the June 2015 quarter One of the constraints Apple has in increasing its dividend is how much cash it generates in the US every year. For a US-based company it must use US cash, US-generated cash or debt to pay its dividends and buy back stock. Apple generated $13.3 billion, $20.5 billion and $18.1 billion of US cash in fiscal 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. It paid out $10.6 billion, $11.1 billion and $11.6 billion in dividends in those years, respectively, so it was left with $2.7 billion, $9.4 billion and $6.5 billion in excess US cash to help with its buybacks. What 10% to 12% yearly dividend increases look like Apple generates enough US cash to cover its dividend and buy back some stock, but it isn't generating an excessive amount of US cash. The company has taken on $63 billion in debt and used all of its $43 billion in US cash that it had in December 2012 to buy back $110 billion of its stock. After paying dividends and using $4 billion of the US cash it has generated over three years the company only has $15.9 billion in US cash. When it is netted against the company's debt it has a negative $47.3 billion in US cash. At 10% to 12% percentage increases over the next three years its dividend would be: $0.58 per quarter or $2.32 per year would be a 11.5% increase and the stock's yield would be 2.4% at its current $96.91 price $0.64 per quarter or $2.56 per year would be a 10.3% increase and the stock's yield would be 2.6% $0.71 per quarter or $2.84 per year would be a 10.9% increase and the stock's yield would be 2.9% If Apple buys back between 4% and 5% of its stock for the next three years in fiscal 2017 it would "cost" the company $13.8 billion in dividends. It should be able to comfortably generate this amount of US cash each year, let's say $22 billion, but that would only leave it with about $8 billion to buy back stock. It could take on more debt but at some point in time Apple will be limited in how much debt it can take on or it may resort to bringing some of its offshore cash back and pay extra taxes in the process. Of course if US tax laws change so that the tax impact is less then I would expect Apple to bring back onshore as much cash as possible. Apple's payout ratio per dividend.com is 23% based on the current yearly dividend of $2.08 and EPS of $9.02 (Apple reported EPS of $9.22 for fiscal 2015 and $9.41 for calendar 2015) so its payout ratio is 23% and 22%, respectively. If the company were to increase its yearly dividend to the $2.84 outlined above, its payout ratio would only increase to 31% on fiscal 2015's EPS. Assuming that Apple's earnings increase the payout ratio would be lower. However, again, since Apple will probably continue to buy back shares it will be limited in how much US cash it generates so the payout ratio can be misleading. Cisco's (NASDAQ: CSCO ) yield is 3.9% with a payout ratio of 61% (based on its new $0.26 per quarter dividend) HP's (NYSE: HPQ ) printers and PCs business ( HPQ ) yield is 6.6% with a payout ratio of 44% Hewlett-Packard Enterprise's (NYSE: HPE ) business yield is 1.6% with a payout ratio of 12% IBM's (NYSE: IBM ) yield is 3.9% with a payout ratio of 39% Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) yield is 3.5% with a payout ratio of 43% Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) yield is 2.8% with a payout ratio of 53% I believe Apple is in a better position than most, if not all, of these tech companies and won't increase its dividend enough to catch up to their yields unless its stock price decreases more than it has. The company generates enough US cash to have yearly increases, which is one of the criteria many investment funds look for when buying a company's stock. It would take approximately eight years with 10% yearly dividend increases for it to cost the company $22 billion in dividend payments, so it looks like the company is on solid footing.
