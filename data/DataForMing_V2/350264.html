Will Apple See A Big Impact From Small Phones? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple's four-inch iPhone SE should be well received by consumers. My investment strategy for Apple is updated as the result of this event. I don't write about Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) very often because it's been a long time since I thought the company embodied a very good investment opportunity. In October of 2014, I first wrote to say the stock was about to hit all-time highs related to its launch of a larger iPhone, but that the best use of that prediction might be for sophisticated long-term investors to wait a quarter or two and then use a short position on the stock as a hedge for broader market volatility. That analysis has panned out quite nicely - AAPL is essentially flat over the year and a half since the article was written. However, a short position entered anytime from 4-9 months after its publication would have returned 15%-30% annualized, even counting dividends and excluding the yield optimization strategies that such investors typically employ. Today, I'm writing about another iPhone launch and updating my strategic outlook, even while affirming other parts of the original thesis. I have little doubt that the four-inch iPhone SE will be a compelling upgrade for many Apple fans. The smaller form factor is important for many users, and this is Apple's first upgrade fitting that bill in two and half years. Apple's 2015 sales of 30M older four-inch models affirms the continued appeal, and this review gives good detail on the trade offs between larger and smaller phones. Apart from the size and bringing the (sadly proprietary) technology up to date, the main draws of the SE seems to be price and extended battery life. The SE can operate through about 10 hours of continuous screen use, but I'm not sure testing the battery life of small form factor phone based on screen usage is the best metric. Furthermore, it's clear that Apple has achieved these gains by skimping on the screen. It's now generally accepted that Apple will need to switch to AMOLED screens in the next year or so, and Korean reports indicate that Apple has already signed an agreement with Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) to supply them. I had held out hope that a niche iPhone release with minimal screen size would be an opportunity for early Apple adoption. Sadly, the poor contrast noted by hands-on reviewers indicates this is not be. In light of a strong near-term sales cycle and Apple's moves to try to leap frog the display industry with AU Optronics (NYSE: AUO ), shorting AAPL no longer seems advisable, despite a much dicier market . Screens are one of the most expensive components in a phone and the move to put old display technology in an otherwise updated product may result in good margins. Nonetheless, this (lack of) development is all the more disappointing given recent reports that IHS is now claiming that mobile AMOLED screens can be produced more cheaply than their LTPS LCD counterparts. Given the strong consumer preference for AMOLEDs, I'm still quite firm in the opinion that AAPL will not exceed it previous highs. I've been pointing out all along that the architecture of AMOLED screens is inherently simpler, and thus theoretically cheaper, than that of LCDs. Reaching that inflection point has some important implications: In Korea, expect production lines to be converted at a rapid pace, given the strong consumer preference for AMOLEDs. This may, in turn, put even more pressure on the Chinese market. Though this solidifies Samsung's position as the mobile price leader, its continued push into quantum dot televisions is either just rhetoric or doomed to be short-lived, especially in light of a recent Aixtron (AIXT) breakthrough . By contrast, the future looks bright for LG Display (NYSE: LPL ) on all fronts. It has demonstrated superiority in producing truly flexible displays and designing innovative smartphones. Despite limited mobile AMOLED capacity, the company has been slowly, but steadily increasing its smartphone shipments, reaching almost 60M units last year. For the time being, though, LG is correctly focusing most of its effort on AMOLED televisions since it has no competition in that market. Continued build-out for all types of products should enable high margins going forward. That leaves plenty of room for entry by other players, with AU Optronics being the clear technology leader and best candidate to capitalize on Apple's need to catch up, as covered in earlier articles. The announcement of the annual shareholders meeting indicates continued build out and partnership potential as well as a dividend that is almost twice what Apple offers. Of course, any product announcement from Apple also has implications for InvenSense (NYSE: INVN ). The Watch is clearly a flop, at least by Apple standards, and its price was lowered by $50 to $299. Much has been made in the media about InvenSense being left out of the Apple Watch, but diversity in a growing market is good for suppliers. Such observers also fail to realize that the design time for the product was probably far longer than it is for Apple's larger devices, and quite possibly precedes the Apple-InvenSense relationship. The new iPad Pros use a new set of microphones, perhaps in a similar configuration to what Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) has been doing with the Echo to achieve superior voice response for Siri? I'd say that both of these developments bode well for InvenSense, but that would be ignoring history . Instead, I'll look for tear downs of these devices next month. The four-inch iPhone SE will have major appeal to Apple diehards who prefer a smaller phone. However, it will NOT have the same level draw that the first an only Apple phablet garnered. Even Apple fans are being drawn to more innovative products and plans , which have been available for months. With a PE of 11.5 AAPL is fairly priced going into another strong sales cycle. However, greater diversification in new markets, and Apple's lack of vertical integration, means the company needs to offer a better yield, valuation and growth. The company will remain a market leader for some time to come, but market leaders don't always make the best investments. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
