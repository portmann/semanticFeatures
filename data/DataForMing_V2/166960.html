Why Amazon At $500 Is Not Like Apple At $700 - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Amazon's five-year performance is now better than Apple's. Amazon still has better growth catalysts and it's not in the Dow. One of the more popular articles I have done lately, judging from the comments, was a piece last November saying that Amazon.Com (NASDAQ: AMZN ) stock at $300/share should be compared with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) at $400. I wrote it because, partly in reaction to comments here at Seeking Alpha, I had bought a big position in Apple at about $400 and ridden it to the sky, and I had recently begun nervously gathering a similar stake in Amazon. Did I expect the subsequent gain of 72%? No. With its performance in 2015 Amazon now has a better five-year performance over that span than Apple, a gain of 272% against just 203% for Apple. Amazon now has a market cap of $233 billion, still well short of Apple's $623 billion but not too bad. Many analysts will see Amazon as stretched, even with my March math valuing each piece of the business fairly generously . If you assume there's $40 billion in the media business and $50 billion in the cloud business, you're now valuing the store at roughly two times sales, which is not the way stores are valued. Still, Amazon at its present valuation is still a better value than Apple is at its valuation, and here is why: Amazon is still not in the Dow. Being in the Dow has been a disaster for Apple. When GE (NYSE: GE ) makes the average fall managers have to sell the Dow's constituent stocks, including Apple. Amazon may want to avoid a stock split just to stay away from this fate. Amazon has bigger ambitions. Amazon.Com is not yet the global brand that Apple is. It's not nearly as big in Asia, for instance. Its cloud business still has a lot of international expansion ahead of it, and as Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) shows so does the media operation. Amazon bears. I believe nothing helps a stock grow so much as its haters, and Amazon's last two quarterly reports put a real squeeze on the bears. My recent pieces haven't drawn the ire of earlier efforts but I still get the occasional "a P/E of 500 is too much" and that's a good thing. Positive cash flow is now a thing. The big news in Amazon's June report was probably the positive operating cash flow. That's something that usually doesn't appear until Christmas, and if it becomes a regular occurrence Amazon has more fuel with which to grow without increased debt. I'm not promising another doubling from here. Nothing grows forever. Amazon's organic growth is slowing, and a lot of its recent innovations, like drone deliveries and fresh groceries, seem designed more for the press than anything else. Amazon is becoming a political target over its labor practices, much like WalMart (NYSE: WMT ), and its U.S. base makes Europeans and Asians suspicious. But Amazon stock has recovered from the latest correction more quickly than Apple, and it opened trade Wednesday less than 5% off its recent high. Once earnings come in next month it should smash through that number. I may wait to sell until they start paying a dividend. Disclosure: I am/we are long AMZN, AAPL, GE.
