Why Intel Needs Fabs To Sustain Its Durable Competitive Advantage - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel's fab is instrumental in sustaining the company's gross margins. There's likely to be cost dis-synergies if in the event a spin-off were to occur. Furthermore, Intel's in-house fab was instrumental in the development of 3D NAND, which creates R&D synergies for Intel as a whole. There's no need to separate the company into two different operating entities when based on the peer performance group and the long-run inefficiencies. Also, the timing would negate the effectiveness for Intel shareholders, and there's no guarantee that Intel can win chip designs even if the fab were to operate independently. I'm writing this article in response to Technology Investing's recent stance on Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) fabs. He makes a couple good points when it comes down to the marginal improvement in performance, but strategically speaking less focus on fabs is a very shortsighted move and I don't think it will add much shareholder value. Fabrication technology is much less important than it was in the past. Having to keep fabs busy, and to finance the R&D for newer processes, sometimes forces Intel to make aggressive moves that hurt stockholder value. Competition has closed the gap with Intel, and appears to be poised to overtake the company. For starters, Intel supports a broad lineup of products with its fabs, which means that the additional volume from quark to high-performance CPUs all contributes to the profitability of Intel fabs. The cost of building a fab is fixed, and the marginal cost per unit is driven by the wafer cost. Generally speaking, the cost of revenue is inclusive of depreciation and amortization expense and the cost of additional wafers. Having more wafers run through the process improves the profitability, which is why Intel economics is driven by scale. The incremental scale reduces the marginal cost of production, which is why Intel is the most profitable company in its space, and that trend will continue with the introduction of other products. Sure, the mobile segment hasn't generated much in terms of growth, and it's even losing money for the time being. But then again, no one said Qualcomm's (NASDAQ: QCOM ) lead in mobile design was minuscule. Qualcomm continues to design well performing chips, and it's likely that Intel is perhaps a couple years away from designing high-end chips that can compete with Qualcomm. However, if you were to include the additional volume into the calculation of Intel's long-term gross margins, there's additional mobile upside so as long as they're more efficient with OpEx pertaining to mobile and gain mobile wins in the mid- to low-tier of the market. Since Intel had the process technologies in place, they were able to design a separate manufacturing facility in joint partnership with Micron for cutting-edge flash storage and next-generation memory, which they brand as 3D XPoint. So, there are obvious R&D synergies that come from having both chip design and manufacturing in one place. Not only does Intel have the ability to create custom solutions, but they also have the ability to quickly implement new designs into final products, which shortens the release window. When looking at the profitability metrics of other semiconductor names, Intel is much more profitable on a gross margin basis. Qualcomm's gross margins are driven by the licensing business (which is almost pure profit), and even then Qualcomm doesn't have higher margins than Intel. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) on the other hand doesn't own its own fab and its graphics business also is very profitable, but it's less profitable than Intel. Even Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM ) is less profitable, and they focus specifically on just being a fab. When you combine both fab and chip design under one roof the company tends to be more profitable so as long as the fab utilization is sufficient. In the case of Intel, it would be prudent to anticipate a couple more points in terms of margins once they are able to move FPGAs onto their own process and sell more microcontroller units as a part of their big data initiative. Also, it's worth considering that TSM is very profitable. That markup they are able to generate from wafers is included in Qualcomm's COGs. So, even if Intel were to split apart its business the profitability wouldn't improve but rather it would decline, as the cost of designing a new fab would require Intel to charge some sort of mark-up on wafer supply agreements to other semiconductor names. Furthermore, if Intel's delay to 10nm proves to be accurate, it would be precisely the wrong time to orchestrate a spin-off as Intel shareholders would be split apart at a time where Intel's fab probably wouldn't secure any orders for high-end chips. In other words, a spin-off would result in a lose-lose situation for the separate classes of Intel shareholders who would own a piece of two companies that have lost their operating leverage due to dis-synergies. Therefore, investors should patiently wait for Intel to reveal its long-term roadmap at its analyst day conference in Q4 2015. At that event, Intel will likely demonstrate a value creation roadmap that will be more inclusive of alternative products, which will fill-up whatever remaining capacity is available. The increase in CAPEX isn't only attributed to the increasing cost of developing cutting edge nodes but also is attributed to an increase in capacity. That incremental capacity leads to more volume, which correspondingly leads to higher gross margins. While the stock is performing poorly, Intel is performing well when compared to peers, and its competitive moat is well established. While competing fabs may have a better roadmap, there's no guarantee that they can deliver 10nm technologies in Q1 2017. Furthermore, Intel doesn't plan on adopting extreme ultraviolet lithography, which will give Intel a cost advantage even when running at a more advanced node when compared to peers in its space. Sure, they're not going to gain the business of Qualcomm and Nvidia, but in all reality, they really don't need to. Intel probably won't secure any wins even if they were to split apart, so there's no point in pursuing a riskier strategy for the sake of pure fab-like margins. TSM already revealed that they don't have that much pricing leverage, and Qualcomm doesn't have that much pricing flexibility as its EPS and margins eroded the moment they lost high-end chip orders. Intel, unlike Qualcomm, can compete in the low-end without sacrificing as much margin. In short summary, Intel's economics work. And quite frankly, there's no need to fix a profit-generating machine.
