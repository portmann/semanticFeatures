Apple's Real Advantage From Owning The Hardware And Software - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Much is made of Apple's advantages from owning both the hardware and OS level software. One advantage that's derived in part from this that isn't discussed as much is how it lets Apple set technological standards. This power will let Apple take advantage of new/growing markets, such as the IoT and the VR/AR market, which are both projected to be worth tens of billions fairly soon. The biggest benefit of owning the hardware and OS level software isn't performance. It is true that optimizing the two to seamlessly fit together performs more with less, but competitors can simply load their phones up with more advanced hardware to counter this. For example, geekbench tests show that the S6 clocked in at a higher speed than the iPhone 6. This is largely due to the increased amount of cores the S6 has, along with the increased RAM. Of course this does have differences in real world use, but it does indicate that the hardware/software performance advantage isn't insurmountable. Rather, the greatest advantage that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) gets from being able to own the software and hardware is that it greatly strengthens their ability to set the technological/design standards that they deem best. So what exactly is the connection between owning both the hardware and software that lets Apple create technology standards? Part of the reason is that Apple makes the vast majority of their money from the hardware, not software services. They are perfectly fine with letting third parties sell the non OS level software, which means that if developers want to make money off of Apple's customer base, they have to be willing to adjust to whatever standards that Apple presents. This developer advantage exists because of how lucrative Apple's customer base is, along with how popular they are. Other companies can be pushed into supporting the standards that Apple wants by sheer market powers - developers will be willing to develop for your platform only if you make it easy to do so. If Apple actually manages to make a standard that the users and developers both enjoy (or at least one no one complains about), then other companies will most likely take the path of least resistance and follow it. This is a critical form of soft power for Apple, which lets them make the best products they can, while also making sure that other third party devices and services will support their products. If Apple didn't own the software, other manufacturers could easily create other iOS phones, which would drastically reduce Apple's power. Any hardware standard Apple wanted to set would be meaningless, since the iOS market becomes a fractured market. The company no longer holds the power to push other companies to adopt their chosen standard. Alternatively if Apple just sold the software than any specific design standards in the hardware would be impossible to enforce. After all, Apple was the one to officially establish how a GUI would work, with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) copying it soon afterwards. One great example of this can also be seen from 2009, when Apple was still a relatively small/weak company. Apple was the one to develop and propose the Open CL 1.0 standard that other companies, like Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ), was willing to accept despite having limited to no market power at the time. The key thing here is that they were willing to be the ones to take the plunge and do the work necessary for the standard, because they realize how important it is that developers can create the user experience that is consistent with the rest of the Apple OS experience. More recently speaking, there's the USB C standard that Apple is likely to have created, and is pushing for with their latest Macbook. You can see that other companies are already starting to adjust to using the USB C, such as the Chromebook Pixel. What the USB C allows Apple to do is create exceptionally thin laptops. This is important to them, and something that they feel is critical to the user experience that they want to create. If other companies are unwilling to support it with accessories, it is likely that Apple will be hurt, but they won't, because of the soft power Apple wields from being able to set these standards. However the absolute best example of Apple's standards setting power at work would be with the smartphone. All popular smartphones today have the same basic look of the original iPhone, including Apple's newer iPhones. They created what the de facto smartphone would look like (rounded corners, rectangular slab with just a touchscreen, the size of the headphone slot etc) and would work like (pinching to zoom, scrolling through different screens, the way apps work/open up, etc). The popularity of the original iPhone led to great amounts of third party support for these specific standards, in the form of accessory makers and developers. This power over both groups would not be possible if they did not own the OS and hardware. This forced later smartphone makers to either adjust to how the iPhone would work or be left in the dust, as can be seen with Blackberry (NASDAQ: BBRY ). Being able to set standards helped Apple conquer the smartphone market, and this power isn't acknowledged by the market, but it's a critical one. Apple currently trades at a forward P/E well below that of the market - 13.5 vs. 18 for the S & P. Part of this is because investors are anxious about how much of Apple's revenue and profit comes from the iPhone. They're scared that Apple will never be able to create other different, profitable product lines. However, Apple's ability to influence and create standards will be the key to reducing their exposure to the iPhone and provide a major upside catalyst, by allowing them to take control of new markets. Two of the biggest markets I see Apple taking advantage of in the near to mid term future are the Internet of Things Market and the Virtual/Augmented Reality Market. These two markets are similar because these are both still developing markets, without too many uniform standards. Apple also does not have much of a presence in these markets yet, but that can quickly change. In fact, Apple seems to have taken an interest in both already. Back in November Apple listed a job post for a VR/AR job position . On May 29 they also bought an AR company . There is also HomeKit, which allows users to communicate and control accessories in your house . Given all of this, it is clear that Apple is exploring the possibility of entering both of these markets, and might be fairly far along on the VR front, given that they've started buying firms in that space. Going forward into the future, Apple can set the standards for things such as how VR headsets communicate with the internet, how these headsets display the information to the user, what sorts of signals (for example creating something like the Open CL standard for VRs) the smartphone uses to communicate with items in the home and a plethora of other things. Most of these will be subtle, and technical in nature, but very important for developers, who develop software for the VR and IoT markets. Most importantly, both are also predicted to be massive markets. The VR/AR market is predicted to grow to be a 150 billion dollar market by 2020 , while Business Insider Intelligence predicts that the hardware revenue from IoT will be 50 billion alone, and the market would add 1.7 trillion to the global economy in general. In the latter case, Business Insider Intelligence also talks about how IoT currently lacks standards, saying, "There are currently few standards (or regulations) for what is needed to run an IoT device." Apple may not have a major position in these markets yet, but can bring their legion of third party companies with them if they should decide to do so, along with filling the current standard-less void with the standards that they feel is best (and it seems that they are making a push for both markets). This will allow them to quickly seize control of the direction of these two fast-growing markets, and extract incredible amounts of profit, as they have already done in the smartphone market , making Apple's stock a solid long term buy.
