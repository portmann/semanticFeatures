Yahoo Core Business Long/Short Opportunity - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha Reports indicate that Yahoo is exploring the sale of its core business. A sale of this business would generate significant shareholder value. Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) presents an asymmetric risk-reward situation with limited downside and the opportunity for significant price appreciation. On November 19th, activist investor Starboard Value wrote an open letter to Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer asking the company to explore the sale of its core search engine business. Earlier this week, the Wall Street Journal reported that Yahoo's board was indeed exploring this possibility. Although its stock jumped up about 6%, Yahoo is still significantly undervalued. If a sale of the core business does indeed occur (which is quite likely at the point), there is significant upside to its stock price. In the case that it does not, there is limited downside. The core business is already trading at a paltry multiple when conducting a sum-of-the parts analysis, and in a downside scenario Yahoo stock would at worst fall slightly. To best obtain exposure to this opportunity, purchase Yahoo stock while simultaneously shorting Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) and Yahoo Japan (ticker symbol, TYO, on the Tokyo Stock Exchange) in a proportion equal to Yahoo's stake in each. Depending on the tax implications surrounding a potential spinoff of the company's stake in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan, the market at worst assigns a negative value to the core business, and at best a very low EBITDA multiple. Even at its highest valuation the core business is severely undervalued. These calculations are taken from November 17th, and although Yahoo's stock price is a bit higher the core business is still vastly undervalued. While this core business is not growing, it still throws off significant cash flow every year and will likely attract a great of deal interest from strategic buyers interested in expanding or gaining market share, in addition to private equity firms hungry to take advantage of reliable cash flow. Even a conservative 5x forward purchase multiple would represent an 100% premium to the market's current best-case core business valuation. The event of a sale seems likely at this point. Shareholders have grown tired with CEO Marissa Mayer's inability to come up with an effective strategy for Yahoo's core business. She has received somewhat of a pass due to significant appreciation in Yahoo's stock price since she took over in 2012, but this is primarily due to the company's stake in Alibaba. Separate this to analyze her true performance managing the search engine business - it's not pretty. The choice to expand into costly ventures and undertake ill-advised acquisitions has destroyed shareholder value, and investors have had it. It is clear that management's approach has not worked, and a sale of the core business represents the best value proposition for current investors. Attempts to sell the search engine business were pushed by activists such as Carl Icahn in the past but never materialized. It is my view that a sale will occur this time around as investors as a whole have lost their patience. While a sale seems likely and would provide tremendous upside to this investment opportunity it is important to consider the event of a non-sale. Although this would not be ideal it would certainly not be detrimental, as the market already values the core business at a deep discount. In addition, other avenues to unlock shareholder value exist. The removal of Ms. Mayer in favor of a more disciplined CEO and management team would prove beneficial, and of course the core business could always be sold at a later date. To take advantage of this investment opportunity one needs to ensure that they are only exposed to the core business. Other posts have advocated the purchase of Yahoo stock, but this leaves one subject to fluctuations in the stock of Alibaba and Yahoo Japan, both of which Yahoo holds significant stakes in. Instead, purchase Yahoo and short Alibaba and Yahoo Japan stock to gain exposure solely to Yahoo's search engine business. If you seek a more aggressive investment strategy, lever up on this position or buy Yahoo calls while simultaneously selling calls on Alibaba and Yahoo Japan.
