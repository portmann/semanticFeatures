Samsung Won't Leave Apple Alone - Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) | Seeking Alpha Competition between Samsung and Apple has been fierce in smartphone features and performance. As both companies become entrenched in the IoT, the smartphone will undergo a paradigm shift in functionality and become a crucial device for connectivity to smart technology. Samsung, late to the table in the EV/HEV market, has followed archrival Apple by investing in a Chinese eco-friendly automobile manufacturer. Samsung's ( OTC:SSNLF ) acquisition in mid-June 2016 of Joyent, a cloud infrastructure and big data analytics company offering a solution that powers real-time web and mobile applications, marks its entry into the IoT market. Samsung's efforts in the IoT will position the company to move away from being a smartphone-centric company as it faces continued pressure from Chinese smartphone manufacturers (of course Apple ( OTC:APPL ) has the same pressure). Apple's HomeKit platform had already been announced at WWDC 2014, and the first HomeKit-enabled products were released one year later. HomeKit is Apple's home automation platform for controlling smart home products with iOS apps and Siri voice commands. Samsung got off to a late start and announced in mid-June 2016 that it will spend $1.2 billion over 4 years for U.S.-based IoT R&D and investments. This will be led by the Samsung Strategy and Innovation Center, Global Innovation Center and Samsung Research America. Today, Samsung and Apple compete head-to-head in smartphone technology features and sales. Both companies battle to introduce newer and better features than their previous model and those of their competitor. Today's smartphones are used primarily for communicating, entertaining, or acquiring information. In the next several years as both companies become entrenched in the IoT, the smartphone will undergo a paradigm shift and will become, in addition to its current functionality, a crucial device for connecting to Smart Homes, Smart Cities, and Smart Technology. I had discussed Smart Technology in a Seeking Alpha article, Semiconductor M&A Activity For Smart Technology/IoT: What It Means And The Impact On Supply Chain . It is the connectivity that will become the next battleground between Samsung and Apple, as illustrated in the graphic below. The IoT is moving forward with great potential for revenue generation. Samsung spent $14 billion for R&D in 2015; Apple spent $6 billion, a record amount, moving the company into the top 20 of world's research spenders. As depicted in the chart below, Apple is now on track to spend more than $10 billion on R&D in 2016, up nearly 30% from 2015 and up from a little over $3 billion per year just four years ago. Apple is gearing to spend considerable amounts of R&D in the near term. This tremendous growth can only be interpreted as a plan that I term the "Big Apple" - the electric car. Rumors have been spawned for quite some time, but stated R&D spend by Apple clearly demonstrates that it will be a reality. Again, Samsung got off to a late start in the EV market. To catch up or perhaps even overtake Apple, Samsung Electronics announced in mid-July 2016 that it will spend $450 million for a 4% stake in China's BYD Co., one of the worlds largest EV and HEV manufacturers in the world and the largest in China. Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A ) (NYSE: BRK.B ) led by Warren Buffett, holds a 9% stake in BYD. BYD sold 62,000 electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles in 2015, almost tripling sales from the previous year. It currently controls about 30% of China's eco-friendly car market. BYD hopes to double sales this year, which would require large quantities of parts. That's where Samsung steps in - to make chips for EVs and HEVs and at the same time, strengthen operations for semiconductors. Apple has been rumored to be working on a self-driving electric car, codenamed Project Titan (I like "Big Apple" better). Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ), General Motors (NYSE: GM ), Toyota (NYSE: TM ), Nissan, Volkswagen, Fiat-Chrysler, BMW, and just about every other auto company (including Zoox, Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), and Uber (Private: UBER )) are among the manufacturers that have been involved in developing self-driving cars to one extent or another. The market is projected to reach 10% of global sales in 2025. The self-driving microcontroller and processor market is forecast to grow to $500 million by 2020. Samsung announced in December 2015 it was working on self-driving car technology. Clearly BYD will be a major beneficiary of Samsung's efforts. But Samsung will not stop at BYD, and instead focus on the entire self-driving car market, competing against Bosch, Freescale Semiconductor (NYSE: FSL ), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ), NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ: NXPI ), and STMicroelectronics (NYSE: STM ). Samsung has been supplying parts to Apple going back to the Apple A4 system on a chip (SoC) designed by Apple Inc. and manufactured by Samsung. Combining an ARM Cortex-A8 CPU with a PowerVR GPU, the chip commercially debuted with the release of Apple's iPad tablet followed shortly by the iPhone 4 smartphone the 4th generation iPod Touch and the 2nd generation Apple TV. For the iPhone 7, there are reports that TSMC (NYSE: TSM )may be the sole manufacturer of processor. TSMC has manufactured the A8 chipset used in the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, but had shared the manufacturing of A9 chipsets with Samsung. When Apple's self-driving car is ready for prime time, it could very well be that Samsung again will supply semiconductor components to Apple.
