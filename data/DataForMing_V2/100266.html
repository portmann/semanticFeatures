Apple: Focus On This Trend - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple's stock price has followed the EPS trend over the last five years. The large level of stock buybacks provides a massive tailwind to keep the EPS trend positive. For most stocks and specifically Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), only one trend ultimately matters. Over the last five years, the stock has risen and fallen based on the trend of this one key number and not based on valuation metrics. Even the Greek tragedy that might unfold this week won't matter to the stock price other than a short-term blip. In Is It Time To Short Apple? , the research highlighted how the law of large numbers was catching up to Apple possibly limiting upside without Apple participating in buying its own shares in mass. The research though was skeptical that other analysts were correct in predicting the stock was setting up for a big short similar to 2012. One major reason is that the all-important trend has an additional tailwind that is didn't have in 2012. Historic investing valuation metrics have always focused on the EPS growth and PE ratio to value stocks. The link between EPS growth and stock value is always loosely equated, but the trend for the last five years with Apple is not debatable. Over that time period, Apple has traded up or down based on the trend of analyst forecasts for EPS. When the stock peaked in 2012, it was quickly followed by declining EPS estimates. Forecasts had Apple earning over $7.30 per share at one point to suddenly expectations dropping below $6 per share in a matter of months. Correspondingly, the stock plunged over 40% from peak to trough. It wasn't long though that the stock rebounded when earnings estimates started heading back up. The lapping of the successful launch of the iPhone 6 will soon have investors worrying about a peak in the EPS trend. Possibly though, the Apple Watch and Apple Pay products will contribute to a positive EPS trend for the year and into next year. Currently, analysts forecast the trend improving in fiscal 2017 with the EPS growing to $9.71, compared to $9.00 this fiscal year. For the value players in Apple, the trend very noticeably doesn't care whether the stock trades at a low PE or not. In 2013, the market didn't care that Apple traded at a forward PE of 10 with a substantial cash balance. The stock swooned as fast as a small cap tech so if the EPS trend changes again in the near future, investors probably should get out of the way. Analysts from both Piper Jaffray and Morgan Stanley have recently hiked sales forecasts for Apple products including the iPhone and Watch. The Morgan Stanley analyst recently reiterated a price target on Apple of $166 on the back of an internal tracker that forecasts iPhone sales for FQ3 (June quarter) to reach 53 million, above the 50 million consensus. The analyst as well forecasts Q3 EPS of $1.82, far above the $1.28 earned last year. Gene Munster from Piper suggests the iPhone resale values are higher than expected. Using this data point and others, Piper Jaffray is still reiterating a $162 target on the stock. These numbers are crucial to the EPS trend considering Apple obtains the majority of revenues and profits from the iPhone product line. In the last quarter, iPhone revenue accounted for nearly 70% of the $58 billion produced in the quarter. The key to successful stock buybacks is that the action noticeably reduces the outstanding share count. A lower share count naturally increases the EPS level of the generated net income. In the case of Apple, the share count scenario is noticeable different this time around from the peak in 2012. While a big debate still exists whether Apple is even reaching a peak earnings situation similar to 2012, the outstanding shares scenario is vastly different. During 2012, Apple was facing a headwind from stock options continuously adding to the share count. Now, Apple is drastically reducing the share count from the massive stock buyback. The big reduction in shares outstanding is masking the actual organic EPS growth in fiscal 2016. As long as Apple can keep buying shares in large quantities, it can grow EPS without even increasing net income. Considering Apple ended the March quarter with $153 billion in net cash and marketable securities, the ability to repurchase shares is vast. A 5% reduction in the share count in this fiscal year alone adds $0.45 to EPS next year. The above data clearly show that investors shouldn't turn negative or short Apple until the EPS trend approaches heading down. With the aide of the current stock buyback program, the trend that turned negative back in 2012 isn't nearly as likely now. And if Carl Icahn gets his way, the EPS trend will get a major boost from share buybacks through fiscal 2016 along with the strong product cycle. Investors should use any big dip from the Greek saga this week to load up on the stock alongside the company. Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL.
