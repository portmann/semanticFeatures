30% Gain Left In Microsoft Target? - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha  |  About: Alaska Air Group, Inc.

Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ) is managing the sale. The target's stock imploded earlier this year, but has since rebounded sharply as buyers circle. Marketo competes with Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE ), Oracle (NYSE: ORCL ) and Salesforce (NYSE: CRM ) in marketing automation. The company has been taking share from its larger competitors. It serves customers such as Best Buy (NYSE: BBY ), Citibank (NYSE: C ), Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO ), Ford (NYSE: F ), and Pfizer (NYSE: PFE ). Microsoft, perhaps the most logical strategic buyer, is already a customer. Microsoft has been active in M&A in the past, buying companies such as Great Plains, Vicinity and Greenfield. In 2008, they made an offer for Yahoo! (NASDAQ: YHOO ) (spoiler alert: Yahoo should have taken the offer). Not all of their deals have worked as expected - five years after spending $6.3 billion on aQuantive, a deal price of 45x EV/EBITDA, they wrote off $6.2 billion of the acquisition's value. But under current CEO Satya Nadella , M&A has become far more disciplined. He will likely be hearing from the head of his M&A team on their options for Marketo in the days ahead. While the target will argue for as much as $45 per share, Microsoft would probably have to pay somewhere around $35, plus or minus $5 depending upon whether or not other potential bidders act. Alaska Air (NYSE: ALK ) will replace SanDisk (NASDAQ: SNDK ) in the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA: SPY ) after the close on May 12. In terms of 2016 index reconstitutions, my favorite opportunity is Willis Lease (NASDAQ: WLFC ). As for Alaska Air, there remains a $1.22 arb spread in its acquisition of Virgin America (NASDAQ: VA ). While this was a great pre-arbitrage opportunity, the remaining spread is pretty stingy - assuming a year-end close, the IRR is only about 3%. Time to move on to other opportunities; however, Alaska is my favorite state for exploring. Ruckus (NYSE: RKUS ) filed the first amendment to the 14-D for the acquisition by Brocade (NASDAQ: BRCD ). The German FCO approved the deal. Alternative bidders are making inquiries. A Federal Judge granted the FTC request for a preliminary injunction to block the Staples (NASDAQ: SPLS ) acquisition of Office Depot (NASDAQ: ODP ). The CEO of Office Depot stated that they do not intend to appeal the decision. The companies are terminating their merger agreement. Alere (NYSE: ALR ) successfully completed its consent solicitations for some of its notes. The company filed a notification of late filing with the SEC regarding its Q1 10-Q.
