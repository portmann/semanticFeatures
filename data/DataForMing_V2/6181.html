Ask the Readers: What Is Your Favorite Weekend Activity? Get travel or cash rewards with Discover it® Miles For most of us, the weekend is when we relax and recharge after a week of work. It's when we finally (and hopefully) have time to do the things we love: go on day-long outings with our favorite people, finish craft projects, or prep next week's dinners — that can be fun, too! What is your favorite weekend activity? Are you actually able to do it every week — or would you want to? Do you prefer to have productive weekends, or do you reserve this time for rest and relaxation? Tell us about your favorite weekend activity and we'll enter you in a drawing to win a $20 Amazon Gift Card! Post your answer in the comments below. One commenter will be randomly selected to win a $20 Amazon Gift Card! You can tweet about our giveaway for an extra entry. Also, our Facebook fans can get an extra entry too!
