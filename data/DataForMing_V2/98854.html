Disney Puts The Kibosh On Selfie Sticks In All Of Its Theme Parks â€“ Consumerist Whoops! It looks like portions of our site are being blocked! Check your browser settings or contact your network administrator. You can rest easy the next time you go to Disney World, knowing that you won’t get whapped in the face by an errant selfie stick: Under a new policy, the phone extension sticks are banned from Disney World’s theme parks. Not just on rides, but nowhere within the borders of the Magic Kingdom. And by that I mean, nowhere in any of the parks. The new policy takes effect on Tuesday at Disney World, and will be enforced during bag checks at the entry to Disney’s various parks in Orlando. That includes Disney World water parks and DisneyQuest, reports the Orlando Sentinel (warning: link has video that autoplays). Guests can either leave their selfie sticks at the gate and pick them up later or take them back to their cars or hotel rooms. “We strive to provide a great experience for the entire family, and unfortunately selfie-sticks have become a growing safety concern for both our guests and cast,” a Disney World spokeswoman said. Previously, selfie sticks were only banned from individual attractions, but guests could wander with them at will in other parts of the park. But after an incident earlier this week where a park visitor pulled out a selfie stick mid-ride at Disneyland , that theme park will also be putting the kibosh on the poles as of June 30. Disney’s parks in Paris and Hong Kong will ban them starting July 1. The new rules will be posted for visitors at the entryways to each theme park, and Disney will update its rules for its attractions on its site soon as well.
