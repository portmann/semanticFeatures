Disney's Sell-Off Is A Gift - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha DIS has been pummeled since its earnings report. But talk of Disney becoming an impaired asset is asinine. With many large properties launching in the next couple of years and ESPN's dominant position intact, DIS is a bargain right now. It's no secret that I'm bullish on entertainment giant Disney (NYSE: DIS ). I've been writing about the company for a while now and it is my single largest position in my personal portfolio. I love the steady income of the TV business coupled with the projected growth in the parks and movie businesses. Most recently I wrote about Disney back in June when the stock had just broken out to $114 and I was as bullish as ever. Of course, the company reported 3rd quarter earnings recently and the stock has been hammered ever since then. DIS continues to be punished and has now entered bear market territory in only a few trading days. In light of this price action I'll take this occasion to reexamine my bullishness on Disney and see if it is still the company I thought it was. To do this I'll use a DCF-type model you can read more about here . The model uses several inputs including earnings estimates, which I've borrowed from Yahoo! , dividends, which I've set to grow at 12% annually, and a discount rate, which I've set at the 5 year Treasury rate plus a risk premium of 6.5%. We can see the model is still bullish, stating the fair value of DIS is $109 right now. That would imply we've got some margin of safety to buy but let's take a look at how we got here. Disney's quarter was actually quite good, although you'd never be able to tell from the market reaction. Revenue fell short of lofty expectations but profits were up 11%. This is something Disney has been doing for years now and that kind of consistent profit growth is why the stock has soared. But even when you drill down into Disney's segments, the results were strong. Every unit except for Interactive - which is so small it doesn't matter - posted moderate to high revenue growth during the quarter. This is the beauty of Disney's business; not only does it have strong diversification but each segment feeds off of the others. The ecosystem of content is what makes Disney special and the most recent quarter proved there is nothing changing there. Of course, investors immediately forgot about how good the quarter was when CEO Iger opened his mouth about ESPN . We all know what he said so I won't repeat it but I believe people are way too excited about ESPN's subscriber losses. What makes ESPN different is that it is the premier provider of live sports broadcasts of all types of sporting events. It is totally dominant in that arena and given the enormous popularity of college and professional sports in the US and globally, Disney is uniquely positioned to cash in. As Iger noted, nearly 100% of sporting events are viewed live and that means ad space during those broadcasts is particularly valuable, something ESPN has done well at exploiting. As the dominant market player in an arena that will not go away and cannot be replicated, ESPN is positioned to be very profitable for a long time to come. And this goes for the cord-cutting meme as well; people aren't going to stop watching sports and that means they have to subscribe somehow. Whether it is through a traditional set-top box or some other means, ESPN will get its fees. The fact that the way the fee comes in may be changing is immaterial to me; the fact is ESPN isn't like a normal TV channel that produces filmed content that can be replaced. You cannot replace ESPN and that means its fees and profits will be around for a very long time. Analysts ( here and here ) now seem to think Disney and other media properties are impaired assets because Iger mentioned subscriber losses at ESPN. That's crazy for all of the reasons I just mentioned. Plus, it completely discounts the myriad other properties Disney owns like its theme park and studio businesses. Are those businesses impaired now as well? That makes no sense and it shows that these analysts are extremely short-sighted as none of them were saying this prior to the earnings report. Plus, this analysis shows that Disney is far less exposed to profit loss from fee reductions than other media properties, a fact that seems to be lost on investors right now. However, this is an important point to make since sub losses are the reason everyone and their brother hates Disney right now. Finally, Disney's content generation machine known as the studio business is crushing it right now. This year has been outstanding and with several huge properties still set to launch in the next year or two, I couldn't be more excited about Disney's future. These new launches will include not only billions in collective ticket sales but also merchandise and theme park revenue as well. I've covered this area before so I'll keep it short but with the new properties coming out, Disney's long term future looks very bright. I think the reaction to the company's earnings report is ludicrous. ESPN is not a structurally impaired asset and given that its profit exposure to sub losses is smaller than that of other content generators, the sell-off in the stock is not something I understand. I think for long term holders of Disney the market has given us a gift; I'm adding to my Disney position regularly at this point and while the sell-off is painful, it will prove to have been a great time to buy. I'm taking this present from the market and adding more Disney - are you? Disclosure: I am/we are long DIS. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
