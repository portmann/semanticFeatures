Xbox One Exclusives Will Put Dent In PS4's Lead - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Sony's Playstation 4 continues to far outsell its rivals, Microsoft's Xbox One and Nintendo's Wii U. The Wii U will continue to languish as rumors fly about the Nintendo NX. Nintendo is wise in moving into mobile markets as the Wii U has limited niche appeal. The Xbox One has a slate of exciting blockbuster exclusives coming, as well as Xbox 360 backwards compatibility. The PS4, however, probably won't be overtaken in existing markets. Sony's lead is just too big. Where Microsoft can overtake the PS4 is in the emerging console market of China. Despite China's economic woes, the Xbox One has huge potential if Microsoft plays its cards right. Disclaimer: I have no direct interest in the console wars, but I do own an Nintendo 2DS. I recommend that each gamer fully research what they want in a console to provide the best gaming experience possible. The great console wars of the eighth generation continue to rage on, with Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Xbox One, Sony's (NYSE: SNE ) Playstation 4, and Nintendo's ( OTCPK:NTDOY ) ( OTCPK:NTDOF ) Wii U duking it out for the affections of gamers around the world. Recently updated global all-time sales numbers show that the PS4 continues to dominate its nearest rival, the Xbox One, by a nearly 2-1 margin. The major market the Xbox One holds a lead in is the United States, and even there the lead is slim, to the tune of 763,000 units. Despite this large lead, however, I believe the Xbox One has a lot to offer for the rest of 2015 and 2016, and Sony should be a little uneasy as Microsoft rolls out long-awaited games and features for the console. Before we deal with the battle of the industry leaders, let's take a look at Nintendo. Nintendo is in a little bit of an awkward spot. The firm's legendary CEO, Satoru Iwata, recently passed away, and rumors are swirling about the next Nintendo console, codenamed the "NX." Some are alleging that the NX might even be both a home console and a handheld, although those rumors are unsubstantiated at this time. We really don't know anything at this point, as Nintendo will probably remain silent on most everything until August 30. That's when a new Nintendo CEO might be announced, as Japanese custom dictates that formal mourning periods last for 49 days after a person's death. And even then, Nintendo will most likely remain ultra-secretive about the NX until either leaks or an official launch occur. Undoubtedly the NX is hampering Wii U sales, as it appears that Nintendo is "getting its body ready" to move on. The Wii U's sales are not abjectly terrible, but still lag far behind the Playstation 4 and the Xbox One. The company is the unquestioned champion of handhelds, however, and has seen remarkable growth in software sales and sales of the NFC reader figures, amiibo. Nintendo's financial position is stronger as the firm is flush with cash from its latest game offerings like Splatoon. To add even more unpredictability to the mix, Nintendo has announced that they are finally making a foray into mobile gaming, which is an area that holds much promise for the company. However, despite Nintendo's awkward position in the current console wars, I believe the company does have a place. Nintendo is kind of like the "old grandpa" of gaming - someone who you respect and venerate, but might secretly discount his views when he goes ranting about politics or something. But while you may dislike the rantings, you certainly don't want him to go away. Such is the case with Nintendo - you may not like the Wii U or 3DS, but you respect the company for what it's trying to do. While the Wii U has fallen by the wayside for the most part in terms of hard numbers, Nintendo has a legion of loyal fans, and its consoles have a small, but powerful niche appeal. You can't play Mario, Legend of Zelda, Smash Bros, or Xenoblade on an Xbox or Playstation, for example. The Wii U is almost strictly a first-party console. It struggles to bring in third party developers, but that won't deter loyal Nintendo fans from buying the Wii U. While the Wii U and NX's fates remain to be seen, Nintendo is in a much better place than when the Wii U was first revealed. The Wii U finally has a compelling lineup to motivate fence-sitters to take the plunge. While the PS4 has big leads now, the Xbox One certainly shouldn't be counted out. After incessant demands from fans, Microsoft is finally enabling backwards compatibility so you can play Xbox 360 games on your Xbox One. The Xbox One is also swimming in a veritable stream of huge exclusive games. Before 2015 is out, Xbox One owners will be able to play Halo 5 , Rise of the Tomb Raider, Forza 6, Gears of War: Ultimate Edition, and more. And if that wasn't enough, a big feature that gamers have been desperate for for ages is coming to Xbox One soon: cross-play with PC games. The PS4 has none of these things. Thus, Microsoft is promoting the Xbox One as "doing things that can't be done" on the PS4. That's eerily reminiscent to Sega's "Genesis does what Nintendon't" ad campaign, which nabbed Sega 65% market share. Arguably, Sony is winning the console wars by a huge margin now due mostly to Microsoft's blunders and the stellar stability of their first and second party titles. But the Xbox One threatens to upend that with highly anticipated exclusive titles hitting stores one after the other. Despite all the great stuff upcoming for the Xbox One, though, Sony's PS4 has such a huge lead at this point that it would take a truly revolutionary upending of the console wars to make Microsoft king. But that upending might be soon coming in the form of China. China, one of the world's largest PC gaming markets, recently legalized gaming consoles. With the PC-Xbox cross play feature coming soon, the Xbox One already has a big edge over the PS4. Despite a struggling economic and political situation in the country, China has become the land of milk and honey for the "big three," as a previously impenetrable market has now become open season for consoles. Overall, while the PS4 has an enormous lead on the Xbox One, Microsoft should make a comeback with the power-packed lineup of exclusive games, backwards compatibility, and PC-to-Xbox cross play. It remains to be seen what Nintendo is planning on doing with the NX, but its clear that the Wii U is probably seeing its last days, while the 3DS remains the handheld of choice for most on-the-go gamers.
