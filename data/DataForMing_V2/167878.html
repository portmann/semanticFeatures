Dividend Matchup: AT&T Inc. Vs. Verizon Communications Inc. - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha Casey Hoerth , Casey's Finance Journal (Blog) (426 clicks) Telecoms, already a good value before the correction, have come down with the broader market. Even the better telecoms trade at substantial discounts to their average valuations. AT&T offers a terrific yield, but Verizon trades at a greater discount. Even before this pullback, telecoms were at pretty good valuations. But over the last three weeks, the S&P 500 has dropped by some 8.5% and has brought telecoms down with it. Many telecoms are trading at discounts to their average valuation and at high dividend yields. While you might find the highest yield with landline enterprise service providers, I prefer owning the companies that will be relevant in the future and will provide at least a little bit of growth. For that, we must turn to the major carriers, and personally, I lean toward carriers who do business mostly in the US, just because the US appears much more stable than Europe or China. So let's take a look at America's two largest carriers: AT&T (NYSE: T ) and Verizon (NYSE: VZ ). I've recommended both of these names in the past, but which investment is better at the moment? This article attempts to answer that question. In particular, this article looks at things from the perspective of dividend investors. Both AT&T and Verizon are undergoing some big acquisitions: AT&T is acquiring DirecTV (NASDAQ: DTV ) and some carriers in Mexico. Verizon is acquiring AOL Inc. (NYSE: AOL ). Both companies are making acquisitions to remain relevant in the next generation. Consumers are increasingly "consuming" entertainment from multiple platforms (not just from movies and television), and diversifying into platforms such as tablets and smartphones. Data from those "platforms" is largely provided by telecoms. Therefore, telecoms and content providers have a good strategic reason to partner up. Both companies are also spending lots of capital to improve both mobile 4G coverage and broadband fiber optic coverage (mostly for broadband cable). Telecom companies frequently spend lots of money to upgrade telecommunications to new technology, and the 4G/broadband buildout is just another phase of that. What it means for investors is this: Capital spending will remain historically high for probably the next twelve months or so. As you might imagine, both AT&T and Verizon are growing slowly but steadily. Both companies are growing revenue by low-single digits and are growing EPS by the mid-single digits. While I'm not saying AT&T and Verizon are carbon copies of one another, the two companies do have a lot in common. So with that in mind, let's take a look at valuations, starting with AT&T. AT&T is down 8.46% since July 1. That's all well and good, but let's take a look at the bigger picture. Over the last 10 years, AT&T has traded at an average of 14 times trailing earnings. Right now, AT&T trades at 12.5 times trailing earnings; a discount of 10.7%. AT&T has been a solid dividend grower, with a compound annual dividend growth rate of 3.8%. That's well above inflation. AT&T yields a juicy 5.8%, with a comfortable dividend-to-FCF ratio in the high 80% range last time I checked. So AT&T is a good value, but what about Verizon? Well, Verizon is down 4.6% since July 1; a little less than AT&T. Once we look at the big picture, however, things look different. Verizon is considered the best-of-breed telecom, and it has, therefore, traded at 15.8 times trailing earnings for the last ten years. Right now, however, Verizon trades at only 11.9 times trailing earnings. That's a big discount of 24%. Verizon is simply cheaper than AT&T is right now. Verizon yields just 5%; quite a bit less than AT&T. Even still, Verizon trades at a substantially greater discount and is at a substantially lower valuation. Yes, dividend investors may get a greater payout with AT&T, but dividend investing should not be only about yield. It should also be about margin of safety. Verizon carries a substantially greater margin of safety because it trades at a greater discount to its average valuation. I think that both Verizon and AT&T are good buys right here. However, Verizon is the better buy at the moment because it is at a very substantial discount to its average valuation. Therefore, I think Verizon has less downside.
