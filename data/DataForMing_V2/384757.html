Disney: The 'Other' Segments, By The Numbers - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha There are concerns over the Media Networks segment's future growth prospects, but the concerns are overblown. The Studio Entertainment and Parks and Resorts segments will be major players for the company throughout 2016 and 2017. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS ) has been in the news a lot over the past few weeks, and the topics covered have had both a positive and negative impact on the company's stock price. More recently, the news has been shinning a bright light on Disney's future growth prospects. In early April 2016, it was announced that Mr. Thomas Staggs, chief operating officer, would be stepping down from his role later in 2016. Mr. Staggs was widely viewed as the individual to succeed Mr. Bob Iger, CEO, so the news came as a big surprise. The uncertainty related to Disney's succession plans - Mr. Iger is scheduled to retire in mid-2018 - caused DIS shares to dip to the mid-$96 range in the days following the announcement. However, DIS shares are up almost 6% since the Staggs news was first announced, as the sentiment has quickly shifted from negative to positive. Disney recently received encouraging weekend box office news on its latest hit, The Jungle Book, and on the same day, the company also received an upgrade from Pivotal Research (it moved the stock rating from Hold to Buy, and upped the price target from $104 to $121). Beyond the topics that have recently been covered by the news outlets, there are several factors that are negatively impacting Disney's share price. Increased programming costs and cord-cutting worries are on the top of the list of concerns, and rightfully so, as the Media Networks segment has consistently accounted for a large portion of Disney's total revenue and operating income. But the other segments have been greatly outperforming both internal and external expectations, and, in my opinion, there are several operating segments that are now in the position to "make up" for the anticipated lost revenue/income if the Media segment concerns come to fruition. For example, Disney's Studio Entertainment segment has been able to produce movie hit after movie hit, and the road ahead still looks very promising (see this article for more information on Disney's fiscal 2016 line-up). There is no denying the significance of the Media segment to Disney's consolidated operating results, but it is important to also understand that the other segments are now becoming larger contributors to the company's overall performance/success. To highlight this, I created the two tables below. This first table is the trending of the company's revenues and operating income, by segment, for the first quarter of the last three fiscal years. (Full disclosure: First-quarter data was selected because it was the most recent quarter reported by the company.) Disney has seen big increases in total revenue for the first quarter of the last three fiscal years, in addition to reporting double-digit YoY increases in total operating income over this same time period. The Media segment's first-quarter revenue is up 8% when compared to the same quarter in the prior year, but the segment's income has been impacted by increased costs (down 6% YoY). The Studio segment's first quarter of 2016 revenue and operating income are up an astonishing 46% and 86%, respectively. Remember, the line-up is strong, so this outperformance should continue throughout 2016/2017. This next table was created with the data above, and it shows the percentage of total revenue and operating income for each of the operating segments. The Media segment still accounts for over 40% of total revenue, but it now accounts for only 33% of total operating income. Yes, the drop in the Media segment's profit is impacting the OI percentage, but the Studio segment's 86% YoY jump in operating income is also coming into play. The Studio segment now accounts for almost 20% of total revenue and 24% of total operating income, which is up from 14% and 15% in the prior year. The Consumer Products & Interactive Media, which is directly impacted by the Studio's impressive performance, has been a consistent performer over the last two first quarters. This segment will continue to reap the benefits of the impressive performance expected from the Studio segment in the years ahead. The Parks and Resorts segment is already a major contributor to Disney's overall performance, and this segment will likely be positively impacted by the new park opening later this year (more on this topic below). The Media segment is, and will continue to be over the next few years, the main contributor to Disney's total revenue and operating income, but the other segments are starting to play larger roles in the company's growth story. This will bode well for the DIS stock price. Another 2016 catalyst is the opening of Shanghai Disneyland, which will turn out to be a long-term contributor to Disney's top and bottom lines. In my opinion, Shanghai Disneyland will provide a significant boost to the Park and Resorts segment's operating results for years to come. The park is anticipated to open on June 16, 2016, and the hype is already in full force . Taking a longer-term view, the exact financial impact of this park to Disney's consolidated operating results is impossible to predict at this point in time, but the growth prospects appear to be in place. Stay tuned, because this catalyst has the potential to greatly impact Disney's valuation in late 2016/early 2017. Disney is a core holding in the R.I.P. portfolio , and it is actually a position that I would like to add to if the opportunity presents itself. The uncertainty related to the Media segment's future prospects has caused many investors/analysts to shy away from holding/recommending DIS shares, but I believe these concerns are overblown. As I mentioned in this article , "content is king and Disney is the king of content. It will take time to truly understand the impact of cord cutting to ESPN, but I have full faith in management of Disney to figure things out. ESPN and the other Disney media assets will do well in a bundled format, so the negative impact to the share price related to the cord cutting concerns should be considered a buying opportunity." Additionally, there are rumors that Disney is in advanced talks with a streaming company, and this would help it transition into a direct-to-consumer content provider more easily - so it would be a step in the right direction if the rumors turn out to be true. At the end of the day, Disney is a great long-term buy at today's price, so investors should treat any significant dips as buying opportunities.
