Why Investors Should Not Ignore Ford's Chinese Commercial Vehicle Growth Prospects - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha China accounts for 17.6% of Ford's global unit sales, with the commercial vehicle segment in the country accounting for 24% of Chinese sales, indicating the importance of this segment. Ford's CV sales growth in China has been patchy this year, but the company is now making a recovery due to stability in the Chinese economy. Economic boosting measures such as interest rate cuts in China will boost industrial and manufacturing activity, thereby encouraging sales of commercial vehicles. Ford is increasing its capacity in China by investing in an engine manufacturing plant and other facilities along with its partner JMC, which will bolster the company's position. The Chinese automotive industry is the world's largest in terms of number of units sold, which is one of the reasons why American automaker Ford (NYSE: F ) needs to be serious about this market. In 2009, China's auto sales grew at a whopping 46%, and the sales volume exceeded that of the U.S. However, its growth is slowing down now. While it's CAGR for the period from 2003-2014 was 17%, the sales of all autos, including commercial vehicles, grew at just 6.9% in 2014. Passenger car, SUV, and minivan sales growth was 9.9% in 2014 (18.9 million units) as compared to 15.7% in 2013. However, over the next three years, the Chinese auto market is anticipated to clock a decent growth rate of 5.9%, which is greater than the North American market's growth forecast of 4.3%, as per Statista . More specifically, commercial vehicle sales in China are expected to grow at a strong pace this year, clocking a rate of 7% as compared to 6.9% last year. Looking ahead, this rate of growth is expected to continue as more people move to cities in China, which will give rise to the need for more commercial vehicles for use in construction and other industrial activity. As a result, in this article, we will take a closer look at Ford's position in the Chinese market and see if it is well-positioned to make the most of the growing demand for commercial vehicles in the country. Ford's market share in Chinese automobile industry is 4.5%. This might look small at first, but Ford's market share in China has increased at a consistent pace, increasing from 3.2% in 2012 and 4.1% in 2013. More importantly, China now accounts for around 17.6% of Ford's global wholesale unit volumes, up from 11% in 2012. Thus, the company has made fast progress in making China one of its key global markets. Thus, growth in this market will have a sizable impact on Ford's overall performance given the volumes in generates in China. But, as mentioned earlier, we will take a closer look at Ford's prospects in the Chinese commercial vehicle market as this is expected to grow at a decent pace due to increasing urbanization in the country. For its commercial vehicle business in China, Ford works jointly with Jiangling Motors Co., Ltd. ( OTC:JGLMY ), which is a major player in the commercial vehicle industry. This joint venture was formed in 1995 and Ford owns a 32% stake. The share of the commercial vehicle business is about 24% of Ford's total business in China by sales volume. However, Ford's performance in commercial vehicles has gradually tailed off this year as shown in the chart below. Source : Data aggregated from Ford investor relations Thus, from the data given above, it is evident that Ford's commercial vehicles division got off to a strong start this year. The company sold 20.5% more commercial vehicles in January 2015 as compared to last year. But then, its sales fell in March and April. But, Ford has started making a comeback in the Chinese commercial vehicle market once again by recording 6.9% growth in May. The irregularity in Ford's performance in the commercial segment in China can be attributed to a slowdown in the Chinese economy this year. In fact, during the first quarter of the year, the Chinese economy's growth was the slowest in six years. However, the good thing is that the economy is still growing at a good clip, and recent data shows that the economy is stabilizing. As reported by NY Times : "The preliminary purchasing managers index for China published by HSBC and compiled by Markit, a data analysis firm, edged up to 49.6 in June. "The pickup in new orders" - which returned to positive territory at 50.3 in June - "was driven by a strong rise in the new export orders subcomponent, suggesting that foreign demand may finally be turning a corner," Capital Economics analysts wrote in a research note. "Today's P.M.I. reading reinforces our view that the economy has started to find its footing." Now, the Chinese government has taken steps to improve China's economic growth rate, such as lowering interest rates in order to boost investments and spending. As a result, it is not surprising to see that the Chinese economy is now stabilizing, which is good news for Ford's commercial vehicles. This is because an uptick in industrial activity will give rise to higher demand for trucks and other commercial vehicles. In fact, Ford considers the recent slowdown to be a temporary phenomenon. Although Chinese GDP will not grow like the past several years (10%-12%), it is still expected to grow at 7% at least . Ford's revival of commercial vehicle sales in May this year could just be an indication of things getting better. As a result, Ford is ramping up its production capacity in China in order to improve its potential in this market. Ford is increasing its production capacity rapidly in China. It has opened two new production facilities of late. In November 2014, it opened a facility in Chongquing, taking its annual capacity in China to 360,000 units. Then, in March 2015, it opened another assembly plant in Hangzhou with a capacity of 250,000 units per year. The company has also set up an engine manufacturing plant in Jiangxi Province with an investment of $150 million. The new JMC Xiaolan Engine Plant in Nanchang will have a capacity to make 200,000 engine units annually, and will supply the EcoBoost turbocharged 2-liter, 4-cylinder engines for the Ford Transit commercial van. John Lawler, chairman and CEO, Ford China, says, "With seven new manufacturing facilities across all regions of China-and ten plants in total -we will continue to meet Chinese customer demand for world-class Ford vehicles." Additionally, in order to help customers overcome the recent slowdown in the Chinese economy, Ford is also providing a credit facility to its buyers through its Ford Credit subsidiary. Thus, Ford seems to be ticking all the right boxes in order to improve its position in the Chinese CV market. Ford's capacity expansion and a full China-specific pipeline of new products will help the company improve its positioning in the Chinese commercial vehicle market. The economic growth in the country might have slowed down slightly of late, but investors shouldn't ignore the fact that China is still growing at a good enough pace. Moreover, the commercial vehicle segment's growth in the Chinese market is still robust. Thus, Ford's commercial vehicle business in China should continue getting better and positively impact its top line performance since it accounts for a substantial share of the company's overall sales in China.
