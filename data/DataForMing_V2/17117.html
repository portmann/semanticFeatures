Despite its glitzy Internet image, Amazon’s operations depend heavily on manual labor to assemble, pack, and ship orders. Its warehouses are sweatshops, with workers monitored constantly and pressed to meet physically daunting productivity goals . Indeed, many of its warehouses were literally sweatshops , reaching as much as 100 degrees in the summer until bad press embarrassed the giant retailer into installing air conditioners. In Germany, a documentary exposed that Amazon hired neo-Nazi security guards to intimidate foreign, often illegal, hires it had recruited and was housing in crowded company-organized housing . Amazon also fought and won a Supreme Court case to escape compensating its poorly-paid warehouse workers for time they spend in line at the end of shift, waiting for security checks . Amazon’s latest “keep workers down” practice is to make temps sign non-competes. Yes, if you are so desperate and foolish as to take a short-term gig with Amazon, you will be barred from working for virtually anyone else for the next eighteen months. Look at how incredibly broad the language is in the non-compete agreement obtained by The Verge (hat tip MF): During employment and for 18 months after the Separation Date, Employee will not, directly or indirectly, whether on Employeeâ€™s own behalf or on behalf of any other entity (for example, as an employee, agent, partner, or consultant), engage in or support the development, manufacture, marketing, or sale of any product or service that competes or is intended to compete with any product or service sold, offered, or otherwise provided by Amazon (or intended to be sold, offered, or otherwise provided by Amazon in the future) that Employee worked on or supported, or about which Employee obtained or received Confidential Information. Pray tell, what possible employers are not included, given how sweeping these terms are? A cleaning service? Nah, Amazon sells Roombas and vacuum cleaners, so you’d be competing indirectly with them. A receptionist in a dentist’s office? Nope, Amazon sells tooth whitening products. A massage therapist? No, Amazon sells electronic massage devices. Working as a gym? No, Amazon sells home exercise equipment. And note that this includes “intended to be old, offered, or otherwise provided by Amazon in the future.” Amazon temps are precluded from competing with Amazon vaporware too. Not only is this agreement eye-poppingly broad in terms of product/service range, but Amazon also means for it to be far-reaching from a geographic perspective. From the Verge account : “Employee recognizes that the restrictions in this section 4 may significantly limit Employeeâ€™s future flexibility in many ways,” the agreement asserts, referencing the section containing the noncompete agreement and three other clauses. “Employee further recognizes that the geographic areas for many of Amazonâ€™s products and services â€” and, by extension, the geographic areas applicable to certain restrictions in this Section 4 â€” are extremely broad and in many cases worldwide.” Now I have my doubts as to how much success Amazon would have in enforcing this contract in a lot of non-US jurisdictions. But the Seattle retailer goes to great lengths to turn a short-term warehouse gig into a bar to future employment. Consider Verve’s description of this provision: The contract â€” which was obtained through applying and being accepted to a seasonal Amazon warehouse position â€” even includes a provision that requires employees who sign it to “disclose and provide a true and correct copy of this Agreement to any prospective new employer […] BEFORE accepting employment[â€¦]” The intent is to create a captive pool of Amazon temps, who will be forced to accept whatever crappy pay and conditions the retailer offers by virtue of being barred from virtually any other job. Verge said it was not able to determine whether Amazon had attempted to enforce these captive labor agreements, but pointed out that the company had been extremely aggressive in pursuing non-compete case against white-collar employees. And some, perhaps many, of the workers who are aware of these clauses do feel the need to obtain consent, which at a minimum creates an obstacle to getting hired by a new firm: Lee wants to continue her seasonal work at Amazon, and because of the noncompete that sheâ€™s signed, she would be careful if she were to apply for a second job at an Amazon competitor like Samâ€™s Club, the wholesale subsidiary of Walmart. Lee says, in this hypothetical scenario, she would be clear with the hiring agents at Samâ€™s Club about the noncompete sheâ€™d signed at Amazon and would also contact Amazon to ask for permission for working at Samâ€™s Club. In the story, Lee bends over backwards to present Amazon as nicer than WalMart, which is a low bar, and to stress that she’s grateful for the holiday work. But it’s not hard to see the implications. It’s hard  enough for low-wage candidates to land an offer. The notion that a prospective employer will go through the hoops of obtaining consent seems unlikely, particularly since many temp or short-term gigs want the candidate to start immediately. It’s easier to rescind the offer and pick the next in the long line of applicants. And even if the prospective employer has the time and inclination to obtain Amazon’s consent, Amazon can refuse to give it, or achieve the same effect by being really slow in providing it. Verge describes how practices like this feed the growth of McJobs and accelerate the rush to the bottom in work conditions: In this way, noncompetes can exacerbate structural inequalities in the current job market, inequalities which themselves make noncompetes easier for companies to demand. In Americaâ€™s post-recession economy, job seekers continue to vastly outnumber openings for good jobs. In this setting, workers donâ€™t have much leverage when haggling with employers over terms and conditions of work. One effect of this has been the expansion of the so-called “gig economy”, where apps like Uber and TaskRabbit draw on a pool of freelancers ready to perform quick jobs that become available with no attendant promise of benefits or job security. Large numbers of unemployed and underemployed have also fueled the boom in temp-agency staffing that has accounted for significant portions of the countryâ€™s post-recession job gains. A lack of negotiating power can lead workers to sign noncompete contracts, [Orly] Lobel [a professor of labor and employment law at University of San Diego] says, and those contracts further erode their negotiating power. Because noncompetes make job loss more perilous by limiting post-employment opportunities, the agreements can tether workers to their current job, making them less likely to address grievances with management or attempt to look for better or more fitting work.  says, and those contracts further erode their negotiating power. Because noncompetes make job loss more perilous by limiting post-employment opportunities, the agreements can tether workers to their current job, making them less likely to address grievances with management or attempt to look for better or more fitting work. Even though a labor lawyer who reviewed the agreement questioned whether it would be enforceable, given how short a temporary role at Amazon would be versus the post-employment restriction, and the lack of employee access to trade secret information, they are likely to have a chilling since a low-pay worker who understood the reach of the agreement could fear incurring the wrath of Amazon. It’s time to boycott Amazon. Tell your friends to shun them. It’s time to recognize that the supposed neoliberal paradise of cheap and easy shopping comes at the expense of workers, and hence society as a whole. You pay for what you get, and stumping up for better conditions for employees means spending more. Take your business from Amazon and give it to more ethical retailers. Jezus H. Christ this is bad. What two-bit legal chump of a twit at Amazon carved this little fecal jewel of stupidity and contemptibly unctuous derision of the human person? Personally, I won’t use Amazon unless absolutely necessary — i.e. obscure math books, but only a few over the past year. Other than that — nada. People can’t look into their minds and say “No.” No I won’t do this, no I won’t participate in this. No I won’t enforce this, No I won’t acquiesce to this. No. No. This is contemptible. No. It reminds me of some final words written by the late American poet Charles Bukowski. He wrote, nearing the end of his life, what he had learned from the experience of living. Not much, he said, but one thing, one huge thing stood out: “Learn to say No” he wrote. Of course, he wrote it better than I just did. Fuck you Amazon and your petty bullshit abuse of vulnerable and defenseless human beings. Fuck your grinning self-satisfied smug missionary zeal for “the customer” no matter how much indignity you foist upon nameless and faceless labor to buff and shine your executive stock price and option pay-days like a shiny apple from Satan. Fuck your “innovation”. It’s not innovation. It’s devolution. And I don’t want to be a customer of anybody that would do what you do.  I think of you and I just say “No” (other than the math books, to be honest, my conscience isn’t completely clear, I admit, but hopefully I’ll get sent to a high rung of hell where there’s at least a little AC to cool things off.) You know what the late Chas. Bukowski would’ve done. He would have drifted on to the next gig, just as he always did. And if some amazon lawyer sent him a warning letter, he would’ve used it as a coaster for his ever-full wine glass, as he composed a new poem about what a-holes they were. Not many warehouse workers would have the resources to defend themselves against a corporate law suit. But courts regularly, on the basis of equity, throw out overly-broad non-compete agreements. Amazon knows damned well that any attempt to enforce this blunderbuss of a contract would fail. All they can do is try to extort settlements before trial. That would be the time for any ex-employee actually facing litigation to start a legal defense fund. Well said Mr. (or is it Sir?) craazyman. I myself had an epiphany (I’m hoping that is a real word and that the autocorrect spelt it right for me) this Christmas after internet-ordering a microwave oven from a supposedly ethical partnership company. The item had clearly been dropped somewhere in the supply chain. When I signed for it, I noticed a corner of the packaging was badly crushed and there was an ominous rattling sound when I shook the box. In a store, I would have smelt a rat, but on my doorstep, in the cold, caught at a bad time, I just scrawled on the dotted line and accepted the goods. When unpacked, all that remained was a smashed, tortured ensemble of plastic and steel. It was the Tiny Tim of microwaves — poorly, broken and forgotten by the world. But still it tugged at my heart. The whole sorry saga occupied my mind for days, like I was in an odd parable for our times. It was beyond a simple case of crappification, there were too many questions needing answered. Who dropped it ? Who knew it was dropped ? Why didn’t anyone do anything ? Why was it no-one’s job to care ? Maybe it was some pee’ed off Chinese worker extracting their revenge passive-aggressively on the unknown and unknowable end customer who had enabled their exploitation. Perhaps a supernatural incident at sea wrestled with the container — not unlike what happened when the Nazis stole the Ark of the Covenant in that Raiders of the Lost Ark movie.  Maybe it was at the “fulfilment centre” which was probably only related to the company which “sold” the item via a second cousin thrice removed outsourcing contract. Maybe it was the delivery “company” (which was actually a single mum using her own 7 year old station wagon as a “delivery truck”, and who, I established over the course of this debacle, let me in on the secret the she  was forced to use her garage as a storage facility, uncompensated, to layaway items which were shipped to her by the courier and her vehicle, which she had to provide and for as a condition of her — zero hour contract — “employment” and for which she was paid the minimum laid down by Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs for personal hire of vehicles) who either didn’t know about or couldn’t afford to resolve the situation. Maybe it was God Herself sending me a message, a bit like the three kings from the Orient, but this time around merely bearing consumer durables. And instead of the Messiah, all they got was me — not bringing salvation to the world, but only possessing a selfish desire to warm a frozen jam rolly polly in three minutes. All I knew was, from that moment on, never, ever again will I order anything online. If there’s misery and debasement in the supply chain, I at least want to view the last leg of it myself. That way, it’s harder to ignore. What was so bloody wrong with going to a store and dealing with a real, live, human being anyway ? I’ve always wondered how a noncompete can exist at the same point in the space-time continuum as the “Right to Work State”. Seems like matter and anti-matter to me. Wouldn’t it just explode or something??? In Americaâ€™s post-recession economy, job seekers continue to vastly outnumber openings for good jobs. In this setting, workers donâ€™t have much leverage when haggling with employers over terms and conditions of work. Verge A generous Basic Income Guarantee would make employers have to compete* for employees.   Besides, robots will eventually disemployee most humans anyway.  What then?  A vast purge of the “useless eaters?” But yeah, I’ll boycott Amazon the best I can just as I boycott Walmart the best I can. *I was once offered a job at Walmart because I offered to help a female worker move something.  Turns out she was management.  She laughed, refused my help and offered me a job.  I laughed because I don’t need to work for a living** and walked away. **Yet I DO work anyway, being useful the best way I can.  Go figure, ye who think we all need a job/jawb. A BIG is likely to drive wages down, given government transfers will make up the difference.  Employers would be less responsive to workers than they are now. The rich will work for a $1 a year or for free (volunteer) BUT the what, where, when, how and how much are up to them since they don’t NEED the money. Similarly, a financially independent population will have a lot more leverage wrt to work conditions. And I dispute your point about wages.  Walmart and McDonalds workers are paid so low not because of the help they get from Food Stamps, Medicaid and other government assistance but because that assistance is TOO LITTLE to allow them to be unemployed.  A generous BIG would allow them to be unemployed and thus force employers to bid up wages and working conditions UNLESS those jobs can be outsourced which many cannot be. The rich work for a dollar a year to avoid all payroll and income taxes. It’s not from the goodness of their hearts or anything…. That you have structural unemployment as a IR buffer as espoused by their chaired academic sock puppets…. is a bit of a tell imo. The rich will work for a $1 a year or for free (volunteer) BUT the what, where, when, how and how much are up to them since they donâ€™t NEED the money. Doesn’t have anything to do with the topic of capital/income ratio. Similarly, a financially independent population will have a lot more leverage wrt to work conditions. A populace dependent on a permanent living wage handout is not financially independent, it is always vulnerable to the whims of America’s conservative culture.  Cuts to welfare payments will be an annual event as demagogues bang the “moochers and looters” drum.  Once those payments are cute sufficiently to force the willinglu unemployed back to work we’re r8ght back where we started, except thejr skills have so deteriorated they’ll have virtually no chance to find paid work. And I dispute your point about wages. Walmart and McDonalds workers are paid so low not because of the help they get from Food Stamps, Medicaid and other government assistance but because that assistance is TOO LITTLE to allow them to be unemployed. No business reduces wages paid because public benefits are reduced. A generous BIG would allow them to be unemployed and thus force employers to bid up wages and working conditions. . . There is no reason to think significant numbers will choose unemployment willingly.  To the contrary research into unemployment tells us virtually all Americans want to work.  BIG advocates ignore cultural and social realities incompatible with their income scheme. It seems to me that rather than necessarily being a predatory company, Amazon have found themselves in a trap of their own making.  From my understanding of the economics, it seems that Amazon along with other online sales companies are finding that the cost of delivery is stubbornly high and is undermining their ability to undermine bricks and mortar stores.  The ‘con’ behind big box retailing was always that they could provide superficially low prices by making the consumer pay in time and fuel to do the distribution and selection work for them.  Amazon is finding that you can only make a profit selling online if you can persuade people that the convenience is worth paying a premium – and it would seem this is not the case.  People are balancing up the convenience of getting something through the mail, with the security of going to a shop to actually see what they are buying, and they are not convinced in all cases it is worth it unless the online product is significantly cheaper.  So it would seem the future model of retailing is a fine balance between stores where you can touch and sniff what you are considering buying, and various delivery options.  It may be that Amazon may turn out be a dead end in retailing, as out of date as corner shop groceries. Witness to that the steady ratcheting up of the “shipping and handling” fees charged on e-bay, etsy and like sites. At the small end retail world, that dollar added to the shipping and handling fee makes all the difference between being a vendor or not. Unless you get lucky and find a Utrillo cheap at the thrift store, nickel and dime is the basic business model. I follow a similar logic.  I primarily use Amazon for supplements that are not easy to find and new/used textbooks.  I’ll buy a supplement at a local store if the price is close to the Amazon price.  I’ll ignore the 15% off from the subscribe and save function but a lot of supplements on Amazon are cheaper than my local store.  The reverse is true for larger items. “The first thing we do, let’s kill all the lawyers.” Undoubtedly this idea came from the top. Bezos is a bit of a wacko who thinks quadcopters can deliver packages and is building his own spaceport in Texas. And of course he also has had great success–despite Amazon’s low profit margins–although arguably much of that success is a result of gaming the tax system. Amazon also fought and won a Supreme Court case to escape compensating its poorly-paid warehouse workers for time they spend in line at the end of shift, waiting for security checks. Amazon needs to fully compensate their warehouse workers for time waiting for security checks.  I don’t care whether the Supreme Court says that this is legal.  What Amazon is doing is immoral. I’m also wondering how hot it must become in the Amazon warehouses before the air conditioners turn on in the summer.  What’s the thermostat setting?  It doesn’t matter whether there are air conditioners if they are never (or rarely) used. Some business elites are beyond ridiculous these days. “or intended to be sold, offered, or otherwise provided by Amazon in the future”.   Who the heck would know this?  The claims are absurd. Editor———–All of this text appears twice: “Because noncompetes make job loss more perilous by limiting post-employment opportunities, the agreements can tether workers to their current job, making them less likely to address grievances with management or attempt to look for better or more fitting work.” just because it is in writing does not make it enforceable…the state of washington, like many states, has case law requiring reasonableness and CONSIDERATION…keeping your job is not considered “consideration” and an “at will” employee is further protected from these toilet paper non competes…the question here is why are not stock analysts tracking…GOGIRA…GODZILLA…i mean amazon…asking about creation of liabilities by a law department running in a circle chasing its tail…high turnover leads to unhappy campers who might wake up one morning and bite back with a class action lawsuit after they are fired…or let go…a large firm like “I am a zoeohn” (greek – zoeohn = animal) not only does not get a pass, but is easily shown to be legally liable as they would have hired tall building law firm to create this toilet paper, creating an unconscionable contract, opening up liability since the tall building law firm “knows better”…most firms will not attempt to actually spend a real dollar in court to enforce the non competes unless the employee is some sales person directly targeting existing clients that were obtained with the resources of their former firm, or if they bring in some “magic potion” information from the previous firm to the new firm, and again, go after existing clients…but realistically, there is no “magic potion” information anymore with the arpanet…B/I (before internet) there were thousands of small trade publications with market data that could be obtained only by having a corporate address…today, most of these trade publications have an internet based information platform and the data, names and stats they used to send out in a small (5k to 25k) circulation is now out there for anyone to see…these toilet paper non competes are just to scare the children on Halloween… In a peculiar way, this sort of attempted policy is a hopeful thing.  Does Amazon expect their ocean of little fishes to become more scanty in the foreseeable future?  Are they trying to preemptively secure their minions?  Do they see a change coming up? Okay, I don’t believe a change in labour availability, and thus bargaining power, is ahead, certainly not in the next 18 months.  And any industry secrets which an entry level minion would have, could hardly be worth the bother of protecting. Another peculiarity — suppose the policy held up, suppose Amazon hired people and then didn’t need their services, and those people couldn’t take employment elsewhere?  Wouldn’t that make Amazon responsible for their wellbeing?  Would their restrictive agreement satisfy the social services beaurocracy that no, Mrs. McCarthy can’t legally take other employment, therefore she qualifies for food stamps and Medicare?  That would be the conclusion in any sane, compassionate country — i.e. one where this policy wouldn’t be allowed, in the first place. On further thought, the trade secrets part might be intended to prevent staff from talking about their workplace, pay, conditions, complaints and so on in any way at all.  A back-door crushdown on any bad publicity, or any organizing activity. At least in North Dakota, that covenant is flatly unenforceable. The only question would be whether Amazon would get slapped with sanctions and fees if they attempted to enforce it.
