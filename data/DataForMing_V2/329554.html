Facebook: A Stock Propelled By The Instagram Growth Machine - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Instagram now has 200,000 monthly active advertisers for a monthly active user base of 400 million. We can see that advertisers are already flocking to Instagram more so than TWTR, and we believe this is just the beginning of a secular shift. We think that 90% of Facebook's 2.5 million advertisers will eventually flow-through to Instagram (2.25 million advertisers). We contend that Instagram might actually possess more advertising potency than Facebook, and that Instagram's advertiser density has potential to exceed Facebook's advertiser density. We do not think the revenue estimates for 42.4% growth this year and 32.5% growth next year are fully baked with Instagram revenue potential. We see Instagram as a growth machine that will propel significant revenue and earnings growth for Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) over the next 2-3 years. We conservatively think a mature Instagram is a $5 billion annualized revenue platform, and further think growth will be quick ( more than $2.8 billion in revenue by 2017 ). As Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) continues to cede market share, we believe there is tremendous opportunity for Instagram to continue to exponentially grow its advertising revenue. We remain bullish on FB and think shares still have considerable upside. Instagram now has 200,000 monthly active advertisers for a monthly active user base of 400 million. That is roughly 1 advertiser for every 2,000 users. By comparison, Twitter has 130,000 advertisers on a monthly user base of 320 million , or 1 advertiser for every ~2,460 users. We can see that advertisers are already flocking to Instagram more so than Twitter, and we believe this is just the beginning of a secular shift from a Facebook-Twitter dominated app market to a Facebook-Instagram dominated app market. Some could argue that this shift has already occurred, with one out of every five mobile minutes being spent on Facebook and Instagram. We believe, however, Instagram is still at the very early stages of exponential growth. FB has 2.5 million advertisers for its 1.59 billion monthly active users , and that is about 1 advertiser for every 636 users. We do not see any reason why Instagram cannot approach or even eclipse that advertiser density, or around 1 advertiser for every 500-1,000 users, especially given its natural connection with FB on the advertiser side. According to James Quarles , Instagram's global head of business and brand development: "We recommend that businesses be both on Facebook and on Instagram - it's the same back end, but a different storefront." We think it makes natural and intuitive sense for there to be significant overlap in Facebook and Instagram advertisers. Already, 98 of the top 100 Facebook advertisers are on Instagram. We think that 90% of Facebook's 2.5 million advertisers will eventually flow-through to Instagram (2.25 million advertisers). We contend that Instagram might actually possess more advertising potency than Facebook, and that Instagram's advertiser density has potential to exceed Facebook's advertiser density. We make this argument on the grounds that Instagram's picture-exclusive news feed lends itself to higher user engagement. Roughly 60% of users says they learn about products and services on Instagram, and 75% say they take action after being inspired by an Instagram post. This number is shockingly high, and we think it illustrates the potency of a picture-exclusive news feed. This is also why we expect there to be significant flow-through of advertisers from Facebook to Instagram. We believe Instagram's user-engagement-focused platform supports an upwards of 2.25 million advertisers. In sum, we believe Instagram will propel significant growth for Facebook on both the top and bottom line over the next several years. We do not think the revenue estimates for 42.4% growth this year and 32.5% growth next year are fully baked with Instagram revenue potential. We like the valuation of FB here still trading at a discount to its cash flow growth, and believe shares still have significant upside. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
