Efficiency Is Key To Boeing's Rising Defense And Space Profits - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha BDS copes with slight declines in revenue. Efficiency currently is key to higher profits. In most articles the Commercial Airplanes segment of Boeing (NYSE: BA ) is extensively covered, while the Defense and Space unit is somewhat more difficult to cover. However, the strong Defense Q1 2016 results and a comment from one of my readers have sparked my interest to take a closer look at the role the BDS unit has in Boeing's earnings. Figure 1: Revenue division Commercial and Defense unit ( Source ) Figure 1 shows that revenue has been on the rise, but the contribution to the revenue from the BDS unit has been declining. The cyclic behavior of the Commercial Department, which is now seeing strong revenue growth with a compounded annual growth rate of >15% Decline in revenue for the BDS unit, which saw revenues fall by 1.3% annually or 5% since 2011 It is important to note that the BDS Unit has 3 segments: Boeing Military Aircraft aims to provide military aircraft such as fighters and refueling aircraft to customers. Network & Space Systems aims to provide rocket launch systems, satellites and missile defense Global Services and Support aims to provide maintenance, material management and training systems So each of these segments focuses on a completely different product and have a different revenue profile, as shown in Figure 2. Figure 2: BDS Revenue per segment ( Source ) Figure 2 shows that Boeing's Military Aircraft segment and Network & Space Systems segments have been coping with declines in revenue. Revenues declined by 10% since 2011 and 2.5% annually, due to cuts in defense budgets in the US. Despite geopolitical tensions and terror threats, I do not expect Boeing's revenue from these 2 segments to show growth any time soon. The Global Services and Support segment will become more predominant in Boeing's Defense revenue. All with all what I expect is small declines in revenue of all units combined for the coming years. Figure 3: BDS Profit per segment ( Source ) What is important to notice is that while the CAGR for the BDS revenue is -2.5%, BDS profit has a 1% CAGR. This still does not compare to the CAGR of 10% for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, but does show that Boeing can book higher profits on lower revenue. Profit growth is expected to be small, but there is growthâ€¦ The Global Services & Support segment is likely to see higher profits.

In general, BDS will see slight declines in revenue with a more predominant role for services as a revenue driver. Profitability is expected to grow, despite lower revenue. This growth is primarily driven by the growing services business and overall margin improvements. The main driver for profit growth of the BDS unit will be margin improvements, but this growth does not compare to that of the BCA unit. In the end, since Commercial Airplanes profitability is cyclic, minimizing revenue decline and margin improvement are important for the BDS unit.
