Cupertino, We Have A Problem: China's JD.Com Just Cut Prices On Apple Products By 17% | Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! Now allow me to write exactly the same thing using what Slope patron saint George Carlin lovingly described as "simple, direct, honest language" Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! As readers will recall, one of the bullish catalysts that pushed the market off its August 24 ETFlash Crash lows was an email sent by Tim Cook to Jim Cramer of all people (one which still hasn't been 8-K'ed), in which AAPL's CEO said the following : "I get updates on our performance in China every day, including this morning, and I can tell you that we have continued to experience strong growth for our business in China through July and August. Growth in iPhone activations has actually accelerated over the past few weeks, and we have had the best performance of the year for the App Store in China during the last 2 weeks." As we subsequently showed using channel check data from GfK looking at AAPL Chinese sell-throughs, the realty was vastly different. Five months later, Tim Cook was forced to finally admit the truth when on last night's conference call he said that "we began to see some signs of economic softness in Greater China earlier this month, most notably in Hong Kong." Alas, Cook was once again disingenuous by saying that softness appears only "earlier this month" because as we again showed in early in November , AAPL had cut component orders with its core suppliers by as much as 10%, a clear indication it was well aware of Chinese weakness ahead of time. But all that is in the past, and what AAPL longs want now is some clarity that the future is not only stable but improving. Alas, they won't get it. According to Brightwire , one of China's top online vendors, JD.com, has just cut the prices of Apple products by "as much as 17% in sale ahead of Chinese New Year" or precisely the time when there should be no need for heavy discounting. As Brightwire adds, "JD.com cut prices of Apple products on the internet marketplace by as much as 17%, according to information on the JD website. Customers can also purchase Apple products in 12 monthly installments with no interest charges and no downpayment." Among the discounts, iPad Air tablet with 16GB memory is priced at CNY 2,399 (USD 365), compared with CNY 2,888 on the Apple online store in China. The iPhone 6s Plus handset with 64GB memory is priced at CNY 6,288, compared with the official price of CNY 6,888. The special sale ahead of the Chinese New Year holiday will span from Jan. 27 to Feb. 5, according to JD.com. The internet company also gives out cash coupons for purchases of a certain amount. The question is whether once the discount period runs out and the much neded demand fails to materialize, how much greater will AAPL's margin-crushing discounts have to get for already waning top-line momentum to persist. For many former AAPL bulls, the answer is irrelevant and with the stock now 30% from its all time highs, they have decided to pack up and leave. Wed, 01/27/2016 - 15:18 | 7104630 FlipFlop Which are the best news sources for business and economics? Here people seem to be ahead of curve; I became curious of good news sites to follow. Braeburn Capital was at $194B as of last April. The  master repackagers have a big stash to their name and are ramping up  like crazy in both construction and hiring. I drove by the spaceship for  the first time in a few months. Holy shit - that thing has taken form  and it is huge. Some 13,000 employees are supposed to work there.  Cupertino will need to build new skools for the kids of the 3K employees about to  cram themselves into residential Cupertino quite shortly. The iPoop age will come to an end in some fashion or  another (come on, won't you feel silly buying that iPhone 10 for fvck's  sake...) but I think Apple's got the cash to burn through the next few  years, trying to maintain their packaging superiority in of obsolescent products, whatever they may be.

Wed, 01/27/2016 - 15:23 | 7104674 Canadian Renegade Apple is also losing market share because their product sucks. They expect that iPhone users will remain brand loyal even though they refuse to make simple yet user friendly changes to their phones like micro SD cards and removable batteries. Instead forcing their customers to buy more expensive phones with larger memories or pay for a cloud storage subscription service.  When the batteries go bad after a couple years it is cheaper to just buy a new phone. Which is what they want. Too bad many people switch to android at that point. Also last I checked (over a year since I checked) you could not download and install apps except off the iTunes store making innovative apps like Btc wallets unavailable. Sorry but I am not going to buy products from a company that limits my options and is always angling for ways to force me to spend even more.

Long story short, I could buy the item in bulk off ebay direct from China for LESS than I could by them from the US company! WTF! I got a sample from both, compared, exactly the same item minus the brand name. The factory in China was cranking them out for anyone that wanted to buy them; copyright/patents be damned! Wed, 01/27/2016 - 16:31 | 7105072 Dr. Acula It sounds like the free market is working then. In the USA, where we hate and don't practice freedom, you can get a "patent" which prohibits everyone else in the whole universe from applying a certain sequence of steps to their own property. Also if you're a "monopoly" you can get in trouble for "anti-trust" crimes (unless you are the DOJ - the sole monopoly in charge of rooting out the "anti-trust" crimes).

They think they can charge a premium for a tech product. That is what almost bankrupted the company in the 90's and will most likely bankrupt the company in the future. There is absolutely nothing special about any product that Apple makes. In fact, most of the products they make really don't work that well and have never worked that well. That is the same with all computer companies and phone companies. You figure that after 4 decades of making crap they might finally get a product that works. But, they are too busy creating the next shiny thing to really think about making something that might actually work. Wed, 01/27/2016 - 15:35 | 7104772 JuliaS Apple is a fabricator. They just happened to be at the right time at the right moment. Attempts at making touch-face phones took place in late-90's and early 2000's, bankrupting many companies like Palm in the process. Neither the technology nor the public were ready to progress ahead. Software wasn't smart enough, wireless internet was slow, multi-touch processing required to much processing. For a brief period there was a void left by the pocket PC makers and that's when Apple decided to jump in and make a blockbuster move. Same thing happens in the movie industry. Someone makes a big-budget flick, considered a sure thing. Hires big names. Builds extravagant sets and then the picture flops. Nobody wants to touch the topic for years and years. Sci-fi, zombies, pirates all had such moments. Years pass and a newcomer takes a risk and all of the sudden the old thing is fashionable again! Apple had a dozen failed products. They nearly went bankrupt for a good reason. The first apple was a breakthrough system introduced at the right moment. The iPhone was the other successful fabrication. However one cannot be expected to be pulling rabbits out of a hat continuously. As a firm, they're they're a one hit wonder. Their reliance on premium pricing makes them extremely vulnerable to periods of lackluster innovation. Apple's iOS is special in a lot of ways: -Native code apps (as opposed to the typical, slow, bloated, battery-draining Android Java garbage) -Slim binaries (big space savings that started with iOS 9. Android apps have to go out of their way to do something similar) -Lack of fragmentation (i.e. more reliable apps, at least ceteris paribus) -Premium clientelle (means hgher revenues for developers and more apps available. Also means desperate Google pays billions to be the search engine on iOS because they need the ever-declining mobile search revenue) Also, Apple's P/E ratio is retardedly low. Like 100 times lower than Amazon's (assuming Amazon's is even positive on a given day). >How do you separate the men from the boys at Apple?   With a crow bar. Wed, 01/27/2016 - 17:02 | 7105251 JuliaS Apple designs hardware and software as oppose to creating a product with someone else's specs. That's why cycle for cycle they're able to get more performance out of their hardware. It's an advantage and an Achilles heel. On one hand they can extract maximum profit out of their proprietary digital ecosystem. On the other hand they are pressured to constantly revise both hardware and software to keep the sales going. Without a new iPhone every year they're bankrupt and that's a lot of pressure. At this point they keep repackaging same shit over and over, not because they have something new to offer, but because it's the only survival strategy they have. Google's in a much better position with Android OS. They do work on hardware platforms but at their own pace. Sales and licenses fees generate profit regardless. I personally prefer developing for Android. Just got around to exploring smartwatch SDK for Androidwear and Pebble. They're a pleasure to work with and to adapt cross-platform. I don't have to think about hardware specs when debugging and to me it's a plus. The open platform approach does make developers lazy - that's part of the reason for battery drain issues - not the OS, but the kind of things 3rd party devs can get away with. Wed, 01/27/2016 - 15:16 | 7104601 GoldSilverBitcoinBug (2,399) --> 3 is an auspicious number too and 9 is number for deities and the Emperor, in theory Chinese avoid to use it because it symbolize the Emperor (prosperity long life and so on). The Emperor still have something mystical even after 70 years of Maoism ! 2 is love: a couple need two people. Same with the other price 6,888 and 6,288.
