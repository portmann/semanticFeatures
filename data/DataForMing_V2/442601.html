Film industry not spared from Brexit impacts - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Jun 24 2016, 20:03 ET | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Britain's exit from the EU is having far-reaching impacts on a wide number of industries and investments -- and while not vital, the film industry is no exception. Hollywood's generally had a strong relationship with Great Britain, Scott Roxborough and Alex Ritman note, but ripples of the move (particularly in currency and financing) are reaching far and wide . The pound -- down more than 8% to a 30-year low against the dollar -- has a bit of a mixed effect. While shooting in London gets cheaper, British box-office revenues will shrink as well (assuming the proceeds are repatriated). A bigger impact could come from threatened British production tax credits (of 25%), part of what has Disney (NYSE: DIS ) shooting Star Wars and Marvel movies there. And legal complications tied to a tricky continental divorce present a headwind for any independent production. Meanwhile, HBO (NYSE: TWX ) says the vote result won't hurt its crown jewel Game of Thrones, partly filmed in Northern Ireland. That show got support from the EU's European Regional Development Fund earlier on, but not in the past few seasons. The media conglomerate saw this coming.Comcast and Disney (#1 & #2 in terms of revenue;excluding market capitalization) did not get beat that much and to some extent Time Warner (#3). I don't think it's in order of importance. if it was TWX would be second and VIA would be #4 knee jerk reaction to the market today. I am guessing that dis will be back in the 100 dollar range next week I would be really careful with that presumption. I don't think Disney moves above 108-110 this year and even that is a generous expectation. Yeah because when I think about whether I want to see the next Star Wars, Brexit will be a major consideration for me. We all wish it were that simple.  I'm highly invested in Disney and in the past year every bit of news that has come out for Disney has seemed to have the opposite effect on the actual share price.  Although Disney has taken the appropriate measures to head off the over reliance on espn with it's purchase of Lucasfilm and the opening of Shanghai. Also, the complete domination of the studio segment there seems to be quite a bit of resistance of moving beyond the 18 p/e mark. Why? I've yet to hear a good explanation, especially when other companies in the same business segment are trading at a better P/E. Good thing though is that I have made enough money at this point to begin the foray into penny stocks with the profits I've made from Disney so hopefully everything works out for the best. Interesting but sadly not surprising that a company as proud as HBO is not too proud to beg for subsidies to produce a show as profitable as Game of Thrones.
