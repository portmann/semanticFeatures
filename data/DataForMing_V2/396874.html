Wireless Telecom: Significant Growth Potential | Seeking Alpha Wireless telecommunication carriers generated $255.9 billion in revenue last year (2015), and this is expected to grow at 3.2% per year through 2020. Growth over the past 5 years has been driven primarily through the growth of mobile internet connections, and the percentage of services performed online. The development of 5G technology and the surrounding ecosystem is positioned as the way forward for the industry. The changing industry landscape will have a significant impact on the top four firms, with AT&T and Verizon being best suited for current trends in the market. This article is meant to assess the current conditions in the wireless telecommunication industry, providing potential insights as to what might lead to growth opportunities for large firms. The wireless telecommunication industry in the US last year generated $255.9 billion in revenue, which grew 2.8% over that of 2014. Over the past 5 years, the industry has grown at an average rate of 2.7% per year and is expected to continue to grow at 3.2% for the next 5 ( ISBS World (Registration required)). This industry is classified as mature with relatively low levels of revenue volatility, and medium levels of regulation. The biggest players in the industry include AT&T (NYSE: T ), Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) (see more on Verizon ), T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS ), and Sprint (NYSE: S ). (Original Content, Data from ISBS World) Some of the largest revenue drivers in this industry include: the number of mobile internet connections, per capita disposable income, and the percentage of services conducted online. Another significant factor - primarily for the largest players like Verizon and AT&T - is government regulation. To prevent a market situation like in Canada, with the entire market dominated by three firms, government regulators are strict regarding what and who these large companies are allowed to purchase. Most of this, however, is expected to change should T-Mobile or Sprint be able to step up as a third major competitor. Revenue growth over the past 5 years has been driven primarily by the explosion in the number of mobile internet connections, growing at an annualized rate of 14.6%. There has also been a significant increase in the percentage of services that are performed online which is expected to continue to grow at a relatively constant rate. Many of the largest carriers turned towards data for most of their revenue growth as demand for the service increased rapidly with the introduction of smartphones like the iPhone. The third-party apps on these devices (like online banking) helped to increase our data dependence. Now broadband wireless spectrum has become something that is very expensive and hard to acquire. In 2014, the US auctioned spectrum between 700 and 2,500 MHz for just over $5.3 billion, and another $45 billion was raised in 2015 with spectrum between 1,700 and 2,100 Mhz. The speed of wireless communications are now phasing out technologies like the landline. People are becoming more and more reliant on wireless devices like their cellphones for all communication, with the development of now technologies like the 5G ecosystem (should be fully functional by 2020). 5G is going to be astronomically faster than anything we have to-date with data delivery rates at 10GB, compared to the 100MB of 4G and 384KB of 3G. Industry experts are calling for 5G the "key" to the Internet of Things, and with its introduction, we will see the number of networked devices increasing from 5 to 25 billion by 2020. Many companies like Verizon have already begun investing considerable sums in its development. That being said, carriers around the world will continue to invest in their 4G networks trying to build ROI. Other large trends in the industry moving forward include increased consolidation as T-Mobile and Sprint seek to solidify their positions compared to Verizon and AT&T, as well as subscriber saturation. As the subscriber base grows, the number of people without a mobile internet connection will fall dramatically. This will force companies to try and take customers from competitors through things like price competition and more appealing rates. The industry will also see increasing levels of spectrum investment with actions bringing in larger sums of capital. Now, with the state of telecom in mind, it is important to find a provider whose fundamentals are aligned with the direction of the industry as a whole. This will afford them better growth opportunities as they are better able to navigate a changing competitive landscape. Although there is much debate surrounding Verizon's acquisition of a portion of Yahoo's (NASDAQ: YHOO ) business, I think that it will offer the carrier the kind of operational diversification it needs to stimulate growth in this maturing industry. Verizon is also making significant strides forward in its development of 5G technologies. As mentioned earlier, subscriber saturation is on the rise which will make it difficult for the smaller companies to really establish themselves as dominant players. I believe that companies like Sprint and T-Mobile will have a much tougher time growing their subscriber bases over the next couple of years, and this may lead to price wars that negatively effect profit margins. For this reason, I think that the companies that are most promising for growth are those with already established dominance like AT&T and Verizon.
