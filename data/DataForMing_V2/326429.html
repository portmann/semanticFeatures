United orders 25 more Boeing 737 worth $2 billion: sources | Reuters Visitors talk outside a Boeing booth during the opening day of the Singapore Airshow at Changi Exhibition Center February 16, 2016. PARIS Boeing Co (BA.N) has won an order for 25 current-generation Boeing 737 aircraft from United Continental Holdings (UAL.N), beating rivals including Canada's Bombardier (BBDb.TO) for the second time in a month, two industry sources said. The deal, which is said to involve the 126-seat 737-700 model, would be worth just over $2 billion at list prices. Boeing and United Continental both declined to comment. The follow-on deal with Boeing, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, comes weeks after United agreed to buy 40 Boeing 737-700 jets. Bombardier said last week it was in new talks with United after winning an order from Air Canada (AC.TO) for its CSeries jet.
