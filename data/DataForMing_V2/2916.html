Advanced Semiconductor: In The Apple Watch And More - Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Inc. (NYSE:ASX) | Seeking Alpha Whenever Apple launches new product there is a scramble to figure out who is in the supply chain. ASE is included in the new Apple Watch. Advanced Semiconductor Engineering (NYSE: ASX ), abbreviated ASE, provides semiconductor packaging and testing services in the U.S., Taiwan, Asia, and Europe. It is the world's largest provider of independent semiconductor manufacturing services in assembly and test. The company has been around since 1984 and is based in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Last week, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) announced the debut of the Apple Watch. The Taiwanese supply chain is expected to play an important role in the manufacturing of the Apple Watch , and this includes core chips packaging and testing from ASE. ASE already assembles fingerprint modules for the iPhone 5S and iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. ASE's System-in-Package (SiP) technology is the key driver behind these Apple orders. In addition to the fingerprint module, its Wi-Fi module and the S1 core processor of the Apple Watch were packaged by ASE applying the SiP technology. Apple has become a strong proponent of SiP technology. More than half the PCB (printed circuit boards) in the iPhone 6S are expected to be replaced with SiP modules. The iPhone 7 may be the first phone to fully adopt SiP technology. ASE president Chang Chien-sheng predicts SiP technology will replace printed circuit boards elsewhere as well, becoming mainstream in smartphones, wearables, and in Internet of Things devices. Advanced Semi just reported February net revenues increased 16.9% YOY. ASE stock traded up on this news and on confirmation of its expanded supply relationship for the Apple Watch. The stock is trading at new highs. Semiconductor stocks have been a bright spot in this market, especially those with limited PC exposure that are tied to smart phones and smart device chips. And with Apple venturing into wearables, this opens up a whole new area of potential growth. Apple is expected to ship 22 million units of the Apple Watch this year. Advanced Semiconductor Engineering is a mid cap technology company with a market capitalization of $11.7 billion. Its risk profile is Moderate. Advanced Semi has a trailing P/E of 16 and a forward P/E of 13. This is not expensive relative to the market, but a little on the pricier side for a semiconductor stock. But its PEG ratio is an attractive .67 given its 20% estimated growth rate. The stock's Value Grade is B. Advanced Semi has been a strong performer YTD and outpaced the market last year by 20%. Over the last year, the stock price is up a whopping 51%. Its Momentum Grade is A and its Performance Grade rates a B. Advanced Semi receives a Stock Grade of A- and is considered a Buy.
