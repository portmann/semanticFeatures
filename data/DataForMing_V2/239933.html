Low Oil Prices Will Continue To Drive U.S. Auto Sales | Seeking Alpha Low oil prices (and low gasoline prices) have left consumers with more discretionary spending. This is leading to more miles driven, and higher U.S. auto sales. U.S. auto sales have been skewed toward higher light truck volumes. Since these vehicles carry higher profit margins, U.S. automaker earnings are likely to continue to grow. Shares of GM and Ford should trade higher thanks to favorable auto trends. Both companies trade with low PE multiples and both pay attractive dividend yields. Tesla Motors is more likely to be hurt by lower gasoline prices as there is less incentive to switch to an electric vehicle. Plus, Tesla is already expensive and risky. Over the past 18 months, the dramatic decline in oil prices has led to material shifts in the global economy. One area that should see significant growth related to lower oil prices is the U.S. auto market. Today, we're going to take a look at three major U.S. auto makers to see how lower oil prices should affect sales. Lower Gasoline Prices And U.S. Consumers It's hard to overstate the importance of the long-term decline in the price of oil. High levels of production from Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries, coupled with shale oil and gas production in the U.S. has caused WTI crude oil prices to drop more than 60% from a high above $110 to the current level near $42 While the relationship between oil and gasoline prices isn't always perfectly correlated, low input costs and high gasoline inventories has caused the price of gasoline to decline alongside oil. Lower consumer spending on gasoline has acted as an unofficial "stimulus" program, giving U.S. households more flexibility with their budgets. Initially, lower gasoline prices did not directly lead to additional retail spending. Economists believed that consumers were instead using their gas savings to pay down debt and increase savings. But recently, new data has pointed to some key changes in consumer habits which show that savings at the pump are translating to changes in consumer behavior. For starters, lower gasoline prices has led to a new record high for miles driven by Americans. This is important for auto manufacturers because a widespread increase in mileage should lead to more wear and tear on existing vehicles on the road - which ultimately should boost demand for new cars and trucks. At the same time, lower gasoline prices have left more cash available for consumers to buy new cars. And that cash is showing up in auto sales this year. It is important to note that light truck sales have been particularly strong. This makes sense because with lower gasoline prices, it is cheaper to own SUV's and other vehicles that fit into the "light truck" category. Consumer taste appears to be transitioning to this category of autos thanks to lower operating expenses. Of course truck and SUV sales are more profitable for U.S. automakers because these vehicles typically carry higher gross margins. So today, automakers are enjoying a trend of higher sales, and a product shift towards higher-margin vehicles. This trend has the potential to drive stronger profits and higher stock prices over the next several years. Below are some thoughts on three key U.S. automakers in light of this important consumer trend: Shares of General Motors (NYSE: GM ) have rebounded sharply over the last few months thanks to a "deferred-prosecution" agreement with the U.S. government . GM paid $900 million in fines on top of about $4.2 billion in costs associated with the company's ignition switch fiasco. While this issue was a dark mark on GM's reputation (both for consumers and investors). It now appears that GM will be able to put the issue in the rear view mirror. Over the last several quarters, GM has been able to increase gross profit margins thanks to stronger consumer demand for SUV's and light trucks. In the third quarter, GM posted the strongest gross profit margins seen in two years. With a 3.7% dividend yield, shares of GM are attractive to income investors. And the company currently sports a forward PE of just 7.5, which should make shares attractive to value investors as well. Based on strong U.S. demand for high-margin vehicles, a cheap valuation, and a healthy dividend yield, I expect shares of GM to continue to rebound. Shares of Ford Motor (NYSE: F ) are not quite as cheap as General Motors. With a forward PE of 8.7 investors are paying more for every dollar of profits Ford generates. Still, the valuation is relatively cheap if you expect Ford to maintain its market share and benefit from growth in overall U.S. auto spending. While value investors may prefer GM over Ford (thanks to GM's lower forward PE), dividend investors should be pleased with Ford's 4.2% yield. Since 2013, Ford has been steadily increasing its dividend payment each year. If this pattern holds true, the company will increase its dividend again starting with the next quarterly payment. Ford has not yet announced its first quarter dividend, but the probability of a dividend hike is high. Ford is my second favorite U.S. auto investment opportunity only because GM has more of a catalyst for trading higher (the deferred-prosecution agreement). However, both major U.S. automakers are attractive income opportunities. A third U.S. automaker for investors to consider would be Tesla Motors (NASDAQ: TSLA ). The company has posted admirable revenue growth over the last three years which has led to a devoted fan base among investors. However, while I respect Tesla as a company and the cars they produce, I believe that Tesla shares are far too risky to own at the current price . Analysts currently expect TSLA to earn $1.95 per share in 2016, and this estimate has been steadily revised lower. Assuming this projection is now accurate, investors are paying more than 100 times forward earnings to own this company. And if analyst expectations continue to be revised lower, the multiple may turn out to be even more expensive. Tesla will not likely benefit from lower gas prices. In fact, future sales may actually be hurt by lower costs at the pump because there is less incentive for consumers to switch to an electronic vehicle. Meanwhile, other luxury brands such as Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz are introducing electric vehicles that will compete directly with TSLA. Given the strong dynamics for the traditional U.S. auto makers, and the risk in TSLA shares, I believe GM and Ford make for much more compelling investment opportunities.
