How Mazda Might Impact Ford, GM and FCA Stock - General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) | Seeking Alpha GM, Ford and Jeep (owned by FCA) have posted a few years of solid sales increases, almost exclusively as a result of 4x4 SUVs. 4x4 functionality has usually been used to improve off-road capabilities, reduce wheelspin and improve grip on snow/ice. Mazda is bringing to market an all-wheel drive system that is optimized for fun-to-drive-fast with drifting control, especially on ice/snow. This new system is being delivered in three attractive SUVs, from the smallest to one of the larger three-row ones, starting this Spring. With Mazda's US SUVs sales poised to grow perhaps 50% in 2016, it's a new risk factor for GM, Ford and FCA stocks. One of the clearest trends in the automotive world over the last couple of years is that the market has shifted away from two-wheel drive sedans to 4x4 SUVs. I could shower you with overwhelming statistics on this, but I don't think it's necessary. And by the way, I'm using 4x4 interchangeably with AWD (all-wheel drive), as for most people they mean the same thing. I know there is a minor religious war perpetually fought between those who feel a need to differentiate between the two terms, but for the high-level discussion, it is simply not necessary. Furthermore, realize that not all SUVs are 4x4, and some sedans are 4x4. This discussion does not depend on making those distinctions right now. The signs that the market has shifted in the direction of 4x4 SUVs are not just found in the macro statistics, but also in the plants that are being built and reconfigured. Here are some examples: BMW ( OTCPK:BAMXY ) built an SUV factory in South Carolina, which is now BMW's largest worldwide. Jeep's (NYSE: FCAU ) demand for SUVs has become so large that it opened new factories in Italy, Brazil and China, and is now exporting SUVs from Italy to the US. Audi ( OTCPK:AUDVF ) is building its first factory in Mexico, where it will make the Q5 SUV model starting later this year. Volkswagen ( OTCPK:VLKAY ) will begin building a new large three-row SUV in the US later this year. Ford (NYSE: F ) announced just last week that it will launch four entirely new SUV models in the next four years, responding to booming demand. Buick's (NYSE: GM ) demand for additional SUV products is so great that it's starting to export SUVs from China to the US this Spring. It's also relatively well known that the US-based brands have had traditional leadership in 4x4 and SUVs. Why? There are two main reasons: The US has traditionally enjoyed lower gasoline prices than most countries, favoring heavier vehicles with higher rolling resistance and lower aerodynamic efficiency. The US is a fairly rural country with big spaces and big houses, including large garages, making 4x4 and SUVs more feasible and suitable. As such, it is no surprise that GM, Ford and Jeep have unusually high exposure to 4x4 and SUVs. Take Jeep, for example - global sales up 22% in 2015, and up a whopping 25% in the US alone. Jeep is, of course, the flagship brand of FCA. US sales of Ford SUVs were up 6.8% in 2015, whereas Ford's US car sales were down 0.3%. That's a 7.1% spread and a huge impact on a company of that size. For GM, having seen an overall US increase of 5% in 2015, SUVs outperformed that average dramatically. Here's a partial list: As you can see, without GM's SUVs and 4x4 models, its 2015 US results would have been a disaster. In fact, without SUVs and 4x4 models, it's no exaggeration to say that financial performances by GM, Ford and FCA (the owner of Jeep) would be collective disasters, and these companies would be shrinking - as opposed to growing and with improved profitability. This success in SUVs and 4x4, however, is now starting to attract attention from players other than just Range Rover and new North American SUV factories being built by BMW, Mercedes and Audi. Case in point, Mazda ( OTCPK:MZDAY ). Mazda, you say? That's not a name that comes to mind first if you think of improved competition against GM, Ford and Jeep, and that's the way you should have thought about it - until now. The company produced 1,543,589 vehicles in 2015, which puts it in an odd category of its own. Mazda is three times larger than smaller manufacturers such as Volvo ( OTCPK:VOLVY ) and Jaguar Land Rover, each reporting approximately half a million sales in 2015. However, it is a third or less of the size of FCA and Ford, and less than a sixth the size of GM - all in terms of units of cars per year in 2015. Mazda used to have its cars co-developed with Ford for many years, as Ford had a significant ownership interest. Current Ford CEO Mark Fields was CEO of that operation from 1999 to 2002, for example. Ford's stake in Mazda substantially went away in 2009-2010, and as a result, the company has been developing its own cars since then. The rationale for four-wheel drive (all-wheel drive, 4x4, same thing) systems There are a variety of ways by which you can employ 4x4 systems to improve a vehicle's capabilities. At the heart of it, there are two purposes: Improve the ability to drive off-road. Improve the ability to drive faster and safer on regular roads. In terms of improving off-road capabilities, there are at least two major avenues you can pursue: Physical body and related: Higher ground clearance, shorter overhangs. More capable 4x4 system, including locking center and axle differentials. Mazda employs some technologies to make its 4x4 system help the driver get through the snow and other tough off-road conditions, but overall, there are other competitors who also do a good job there - enough so that it probably won't be Mazda's most important 4x4 selling point. All-wheel drive systems for driving fun and drifting! Where things get more interesting is in terms of driving dynamics on-road, typically on snow or ice. Many of the "lighter" 4x4 systems that are meant to penalize the fuel economy the least work along these lines: During favorable conditions, the front wheels drive the car, and the rear wheels basically roll with the flow, being "disconnected" from the power. Then, when the car senses that the front wheels are starting to slip (turning faster than the rear wheels), it engages a clutch that transfers typically up to 50% of the power to the rear wheels. That way, the car regains grip and calms down, reducing the propensity to slide on snow and ice, for example. It's a "reactive" system. However, in that kind of system, it can take just a little bit of time for the system to engage, and it often results in the car understeering. This may be a safe approach, but it is not particularly fun. It's basically like someone slapping you on the fingers from doing something that might be fun, but also unsafe. What Mazda has done to set itself apart is to engineer a system that allows the driver to aggressively pursue a curve in ice and snow, where the system engages so fast that it seems seamless to the driver. This system makes it easier for the driver to control the rear of the car drifting, sort of like on a rear-wheel drive car like Mazda's own MX-5 Miata. It's a system that is more "predictive" than reactive. In short, it becomes more fun for the skillful driver, especially on snow and ice. The driver can drive faster, but not feel like the traction-control system slaps him on the fingers as if with a ruler. Mazda first installed this system in the CX-5 SUV, which used to be considered small, but is now no longer considered the smallest thanks to many automakers launching even smaller SUVs, especially in the last year. The Mazda CX-5 competes with cars such as Ford Escape, Chevrolet Equinox and Jeep Cherokee. As a result, Mazda sold 111,450 units of the CX-5 in the US alone in 2015, up 12% over 2014. This has accelerated in December 2015 and January 2016, with 48% and 29% sales increases. As you can see, almost 10% of Mazda's entire global output now is in the form of this one model being sold in a single country - the US. But wait, there is more! In 2015, Mazda started selling an even smaller SUV, the CX-3, with the same differentiated 4x4 system. This all-new mini SUV has become Mazda's fourth-best selling car in the US in a matter of just a handful of the most recent months. It competes with cars such as Buick Encore, Chevrolet Trax, Jeep Renegade and... nothing yet from Ford. It's interesting to see Mazda beat its former owner Ford to this hot new ultra-small SUV segment. Mazda is set to close the competitive loop with GM, Ford and Jeep this June 2016 quarter with the arrival of its flagship three-row SUV, the CX-9, in US dealerships. This is the last model to be completely redesigned away from the old Ford legacy. The company has targeted US sales of the CX-9 to 40,000 annualized units, at least to start. Much of this will come out of GM's, Ford's and Jeep's lunch box. This three-row SUV competes with Ford Explorer, Chevrolet Traverse, GMC Acadia, Buick Enclave and a future Jeep model yet to be unveiled (2018 model year Wagoneer). To say that the stock market has treated Ford, GM and FCAU unkindly over the last 12 months is no overstatement. All three companies continue to post improving results with sales records overall, but the stocks have gone mostly nowhere, and in some cases, have gone down a bit. One trembles at the thought of what would have happened to GM, Ford and FCA shares if the companies had not seen exceptionally strong sales growth in their most profitable segment: 4x4 SUVs. Sales and profitability would have been down. It's as if the market has been discounting such scenarios already. And now comes Mazda with a trio of 4x4 SUVs that promise exceptional styling - I mean, just look at these cars! - in combination with a four-wheel drive system set up to optimize for driving fun instead of (1) off-road terrain and (2) simply calming the vehicle down so you don't slip off the ice/snow. With Mazda's overall US SUV sales up 15% in 2015 and 40% as a start to 2016, it should do even dramatically better ahead in 2016 as it benefits from a full year of sales from the CX-3 and the onset of CX-9 sales in June. It would not be a surprise to see Mazda's 2016 US SUV sales up 50% over 2015, taking market share from GM, Ford and Jeep. Conclusion: Watch up, GM, Ford and FCA GM, Ford and FCA are priced for perpetual bear market. If their 4x4 SUV franchises were left relatively undisturbed, continuing to outgrow the market and do so profitably, these stocks would probably outperform from here. However, it now looks like their 4x4 SUV franchises will not be left undisturbed. While they will be under attack from multiple directions, Mazda is at the knee of a hockey stick competitive assault, with a unique all-wheel drive system applied to three very attractive SUVs going after the meat of the 4x4 SUV market. At 1.5 million cars per year produced, Mazda has room to grow - at the expense of GM, Ford and FCA, probably.
