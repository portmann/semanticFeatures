ETF Hub Jul 24 2015, 04:07 ET | About: Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor With the possibility of a Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) split afloat, an interesting piece of analysis has surfaced on Wall Street, pointing towards Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) as the best possible beau if the firm decides to break itself up. Other suitors for Qualcomm's chip business, valued at $30B-$40B, could include a consortium backed by the Chinese government and Samsung Electronics ( OTC:SSNLF ). Intel is trying to push x86 over ARM, why would it want to go back to ARM after it sold its ARM last time? "A consortium backed by the Chinese Government and Samsung Electronics " which is a South Korean company makes very little sense. Besides, the Federal government would have to give it's consent for a foreign company purchase if any of Qualcomm's technology may have dual use and the sale of which may potentially compromise US national security.
