Apple: Q1 2016 Could Be A Harbinger Of Softer Days Ahead - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha iPhone supplier production cuts point to a slow quarter. Fiksu.com data show the current launch is lagging 2014. Tim Cook's ebullient comments on "switching rates" from Android are, at best, misleading. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is looking at a soft quarter, in my opinion. The recent news of cutbacks in iPhone 6s builds throughout the supply chain are at least one indicator, although a soft one, since those cutbacks may have more to do with inventory management than iPhone sales rates. A better indicator of sales is the Fiksu.com iPhone launch comparison. This year looks well behind last year, particularly for the iPhone 6s, which seems to be lagging the 2014 launch (as a percentage of iPhones in use) by about one-third. Of course, the percentage is applied to a higher base, with the installed base of iPhones at the time of the iPhone 6s launch probably 100 million greater than was the case in 2014. Using a guesstimate of 400 million iPhones in use at the outset of the 2014 launch and 500 million in use at the time of the 2015 launch, almost 40 million iPhones were sold in the first 47 days of the 2014 launch, but only 35 million so far in 2015. The next six weeks are critical, with the important Christmas selling season now upon us, and Apple products typically found under many Christmas trees. If iPhone volumes drop much below the 74.5 million sold last Christmas season, the Christmas stocking for Apple investors may hold a lump of coal. Last July, Apple CEO Tim Cook crowed that the Android conversion rate to iOS was "the highest switching rate they have ever measured". According to Cook, 30% of iPhone buyers in Q4 of fiscal 2015 converted from an Android device. That comment suggested Android users were switching to iPhones at a very high rate. Bunkum. Investors should take a moment to look at what hard data does exist. Statista reports that the 2014 installed base of Android versus iOS smartphones was 1.6 billion to 395 million, or about four to one. Apple shipped 48 million iPhones in Q4 of its fiscal 2015. Thirty percent of that figure is about 13 million units, less than 1% of the installed base of Android phones. One percent of users switching in a quarter is hardly a stampede to the new iPhone. Cook provided little input on how many iPhone users had switched to Android and, in my view, for good reason. I am confident that number is a lot more than 1% of the 395 million installed base of iPhones, which would comprise a paltry 4 million. It seems Cook can use the iPhone's minuscule market share to his advantage when crowing about the "switching rate", since even a tiny percentage of Android users converting amounts to what seems to an enormous percentage of iPhone sales. Data are sparse, but the latest information suggests Android users are more loyal to their OS than iOS users, at least according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners ("CIRP"). Cook can use the statistics to boast about iPhone success, but he runs the risk of being taken to task at the next lower level of abstraction by research, such as that published by CIRP. Regardless of whose statistics you prefer, it seems clear that Apple is heading into a quarter of soft iPhone sales. If that softness persists, and I think it will, the halcyon days of the iPhone are behind us, and the trajectory for Apple stock is southward.
