How Is Ford Planning To Restore The Lincoln Continental Legacy? - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford is reviving Lincoln Continental as a part of its plans to reinvigorate Lincoln, its luxury division. It is targeting the Chinese and American markets, with special attention to Chinese buyers. Chinaâ€™s luxury car market is growing at a good pace, and customers there revere the Lincoln brand. Luxury cars form a very important part of any automaker's portfolio as they garner delectable margins. Ford Motor (NYSE: F ) is reviving its golden oldie Lincoln Continental in the hope of giving Lincoln (the luxury car division) a new lease on life. Lincoln saw sales go up 16% in 2014 compared with 2013, but still came in at a not-so-impressive number eight in the U.S. luxury car market. Almost all the Lincolns were sold at home turf. But there are lucrative opportunities outside too. The Continental's return might give Ford a new hunting ground, and at the same time improve its position back home. Let's delve deeper. Ford introduced its Lincoln Continental concept at the recently-concluded New York International Auto Show, and plans to start sales in 2016 . The Lincoln Continental dates back to 1938 when Edsel, founder Henry Ford's son, authorized a convertible that he could take on vacation. Soon the Continental was included in Lincoln's lineup and hit the road in 1939 . Since then, the Continental was phased out many times. Its deliveries topped in 1990 with sales of 62,732 units. 1960 Lincoln Continental from Wikimedia Commons . The slide began as the Continental started appearing dull and pricier against the stylish new brands Ford acquired - Jaguar and Volvo. Besides, the classic luxury sedan once best known to carry U.S. Presidents, faced tough competition from German and Asian new arrivals. Toyota's (NYSE: TM ) Lexus gained huge popularity and became the bestselling luxury brand in the U.S. by 2000. Mercedes, BMW (OTCPK: BAMXF ), and Audi also invaded Lincoln Continental's territory. Ultimately, Ford decided to cease its production in 2002 and discontinued the model. Resurrecting the sedan after 13 long years shows Ford is sensing potential in the market. The luxury segment is thriving in the global market, and the Detroit carmaker is paying special attention to China. The Continental could be hard to sell at home as Americans have a soft corner for midsized sedans and SUVs over a full-scale sedan. But the sedan could do a world of good to Lincoln's image as its luxurious features have gone beyond the bland premium tag attached to most Lincoln cars. AutoTrader.com analyst Michelle Krebs said in a news report: "Lincoln to date has been premium but not necessarily luxury. This moves them to the true luxury realm." China has become a red-hot market for luxury sedans such as Mercedes S-Class, Audi A6 and A8, and BMW 7-Series. In 2015, Mercedes Benz is expected to sell 330,000 units, Audi 640,000 units, and BMW about 483,000 units in the Mainland, which is higher than these carmakers' U.S. volumes, according to industry researcher IHS Automotive . IHS estimates China's luxury sales rose 22% in 2014, and this year, the segment could grow around 13%. The Continental has a special place in Chinese hearts - it is recognized as the car of political figures and celebrities. In a conference held late last year, president of Lincoln division, Kumar Galhotra , had said market research conducted by the company revealed that customers in China regard Lincoln to be more prestigious than Audi and in same league as Lexus. Ford expects 10.7 million luxury car sales to be sold globally by 2020, and China will be one of the biggest contributors. If Ford can capitalize on China's booming demand and gradually regain ground in the U.S., it would boost the company's bottom line considerably. Luxury cars have wider margins and contribute significantly to profit. In 2013, sale of luxury cars made for only 9% of industry revenue, but accounted for 30% of profits. Ford aims to triple global Lincoln sales to 300,000 by 2020, and expects China to contribute the lion's share. As such, it's building the vehicle more in tune with Chinese preferences. According to The Detroit News, Galhotra said the company's taking "input from all our Chinese customers" to ensure that the Continental best suits Chinese expectations of a luxury car. Buyers of premium cars in China prefer taking the rear seat and hiring chauffeurs to drive through the crazy traffic in contrast to Americans and Europeans who'd rather take control of their Mercedes S-Class or the BMW 7-Series. "A Mercedes-Benz S-Class sold in the U.S. and Europe focuses on the driver… In China, the focus is on the rear-seat passengers in terms of everything from space to amenities," IHS Automotive analyst Stephanie Brinley told the Los Angeles Times. Therefore, the car's rear seat has amenities such as electric socket to power devices, champagne cooler, and a laptop table. Rear passengers would be able to recline and adjust their seats in 30 ways. Seat cover would be of top-notch leather, and floor carpet of shearling wool. The Lincoln Continental would be powered by Ford's 3 liter turbocharged V6 EcoBoost engine that's presently exclusive for the model. Ford is going all out to revitalize Lincoln. Continental's resurrection is a step toward that goal, and if the sedan meets expectations, the luxury division could stage a comeback.
