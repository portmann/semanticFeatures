Good Business Portfolio Guidelines Comparison For Boeing - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Boeing meets 8 of 9 Good Business Portfolio Guidelines. Boeing has total return of 96.7% for a 28 month test period. This article compares Boeing (NYSE: BA ) parameters to my 9 guidelines of the Good Business Portfolio. BA total return is also compared to the DOW average over a 28 month test period. 1. NEVER EVER buy any company or security that has more than three letters in the symbol. I know this eliminates just about all mutual funds, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) and a lot of other large cap good companies, but it also eliminates the small cap startups and many others that are not good investments. The only exception to this guideline is the purchase of a high grade corporate investment grade bond fund. 2. Capitalization should be at least $7 Billion (share price times number of shares outstanding) Passed: Capitalization of Boeing is $106 Billion. 3. Company should have a dividend of at least 1.0% on a yearly basis and the dividend should have been increased in 7 of the last 10 years. Passed: Boeing's dividend was just raised and now pays 2.5% per year and Boeing has increased the dividend 7 of the last 10 years just making it for this guideline. 4. Cash flow should be strongly positive. This allows dividends to increase, do share buy backs, and purchase of other companies to expand the company business. You can't make cash up by accounting tricks like World Com and Enron. Failed: Based on first quarter's earnings report, cash flow was much lower than expected. In the fourth quarter earnings report of 2014 cash flow was extremely high, so taking the average of the two quarters shows Boeing still has good cash flow. I will give this a fail short term and watch the cash flow parameter in the next quarter. I feel this slight pullback of the cash flow miss is a buying opportunity for BA. 5. The company should be listed on a Major exchange (NYSE). No NASDAQ or over the counter and pink sheets, NO venture capital. 6. The company business should be understood. Don't invest in business models or products you don't understand. Would you buy the whole company if you could is the question. If yes, the company can be bought (Peter Lynch). As an example I don't understand Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ). If you can actually understand how Google will continue to grow then you can buy it, except that it violates guideline number 1. Passed: Boeing is the biggest commercial airplane manufacturer. Boeing also does a fair amount of work for the Military. Its business is building airplanes. 7. Never invest in the following class of companies; - Airline operations business (poor business model). They should charge a price that they can make money on. - BDCs, too much debt and bad businesses. High dividends are not worth it. It's better to have a real company like Harley Davidson (NYSE: HOG ), that has an iconic product. 8. S&P Capital IQ rating should be at least 3 or better. Consider sell when its rating drops to 2 or 1. Passed: S&P Capital IQ rating is 4 stars indicating a buy. Also S&P Capital IQ recently raised Boeing's one year target price to $188. 9. Remember you are not buying stock, you are buying shares in a company. Consider yourself an owner, you are. This idea may seem silly but it's one of the best in this list, very important. As an owner, do your home work, read about the company every few days and check prices at least once a week. Having a list on your favorite financial site like Seeking Alpha or web home page will help. Boeing is the top performer in my Good Business Portfolio with a total return of 96.7% over a 28 month test period. (starting Jan 1, 2013) I chose this time frame since it included the great year of 2013 and the moderate year of 2014. The DOW baseline for this period is 36.99% and Boeing easily beat that baseline. Evaluation of Guidelines and conclusion Boeing passed 8 of 9 guidelines with a failed guideline for cash flow short term. Boeing became my top position in the portfolio due to its constant growth over time indicated by the dividend guideline. I'm going to hold BA until it becomes 10% of the portfolio then trim it a bit to get it down to 9% of the portfolio. I normally trim at 8% of the portfolio but Boeing is too good of a growing business. If Boeing never got another order it would take them 8 years to build and finish their backlog of orders. One parameter which is subjective is Boeing's excellent engineering and management. When Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSY ) decided to build the massive A380, Boeing decided to go in another direction. Boeing reasoned that people would want to go point to point in an airplane trip rather than have to go to a hub and then transfer to another flight to get to their destination. That was the making of the 787, which can fly further allowing more point to point routes and it uses a lot less fuel. Boeing also let loose their engineers to use the latest technology to make an airplane that had a flight experience better for the passengers. It is this decision that is keeping BA well ahead of Airbus. It is Boeing's good management and engineering that really makes Boeing a great company. Airbus is 2 - 3 years behind Boeing and they are playing catch up. In conclusion, BA is a buy and will provide increasing earnings, profits and dividends for the investor for years to come. BA is suitable for the growth and dividend income investor. I would be buying Boeing but I already have a more than full position in the portfolio. Of course this is not a recommendation to buy or sell and you should always do your own research and talk to your financial advisor before any purchase or sale.
