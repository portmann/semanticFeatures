Intel And Cisco Head-To-Head - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Cisco Systems shares dipped with the market in August, despite what appeared to be a solid earnings report. It prompted me to evaluate Cisco versus Intel; for years, Intel has been a longstanding Tech portfolio position. Tech stocks have a prominent place in my stock portfolio, comprising about 10% of the aggregate total. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) are my two current holdings. From time-to-time, I compare Intel with other large Tech names. It provides perspective, and may offer a competitive challenge to the original investment thesis. Recently, I turned my attention to Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO ), another "Old Tech" name. Shares tumbled 12% after what was perceived to be a very good August earnings release . Notably, CEO John Chambers turned over the reins to long-time Cisco exec, Chuck Robbins. Mr. Chambers served as CEO for that past 20 years. Cisco is the leader in the design and manufacturing of internet-based networking products, and related services to the communications and information technology businesses. Intel is the kingpin of the computer chip business; probably more-accurately expressed as certain digital technology platforms. Both tech companies are the undisputed champions of their respective industries. Let's begin by doing side-by-side comparisons of some key financial metrics. I selected these specific measures as representative and reasonable comps for the two Technology sectors businesses, though it's recognized Intel and Cisco operate in differing Technology industries. Both corporations own pristine balance sheets. Liquidity, cash, and debt management are excellent. Generally, trends are stable or improving. Intel and Cisco have positive net debt positions, though Cisco is unusually cash-rich. In response to low interest rates and high capex, Intel management elected to ramp up long-term debt between 2010 and 2012. Prior to that decision, Intel and Cisco had comparable net debt positions. Remarkably, nearly half of Cisco's market value is comprised of cash and investments. Such a high percentage of balance sheet cash and investment is rare. More on this later. I point out Cisco carries a relatively high proportion of goodwill and intangibles on its balance sheet. This is due to significant M&A activity. I prefer to see this figure below 20%. Edge: Intel and Cisco have outstanding balance sheets. Perhaps a slight edge to Cisco based on cash. However, one may question the necessity of holding such high levels of cash and outside investment. Again, these companies exhibit very strong figures. Intel and Cisco command solid RoE; returns above 15% marker are considered excellent. EBIT/EV > 10% is the hurdle rate reserved for the best corporations; both meet this grade, too. E/A is a metric appreciated by the investment great Benjamin Graham. A ratio greater than 0.50 indicates exceptional overall financial strength. I favor corporations that earn profits largely in cash. Income statements may contain accounting conventions that distort the underlying operation, to the positive or negative. Comparing profits to operating cash flow offers a clean line-of-sight. Here we find two Tech titans spinning off loads of cash flow, well above comparable earnings. Over the past fiscal year, Cisco has remarkably generated even more Free Cash Flow than profit. This is a function of outstanding OCF coupled with low capex requirements. The numbers tell a story, but the number are not THE story. In a nutshell, Intel has been hampered by its legacy, slow-growth PC business, and perceived, "late to the ball" foray to the handset market. On the other hand, Intel "owns" the PC chip market, as well as the rapidly growing server chip business. Up-and-coming IoT and NAND (non-volatile memory) segments are poised for future growth, but are yet too small to move the needle. Indeed, I concur the traditional PC business is in secular decline, though perhaps not as dire as proclaimed by some pundits. The demand for desktop and traditional laptop PCs is decreasing. Refresh rates are being extended. However, hybrid form factors (i.e., 2-in-1s) are filling some of the void. Intel has well-positioned itself to manage the transition. Device form is changing, but I'm not so sure overall non-handset device demand is in permanent secular decline. Part of this thesis is based on a view the chip market is mature; in many ways resembling old-line manufacturing / industrial concerns. Global economic conditions are a demand driver, particularly Asia and emerging markets, where more than half of Intel's sales originate. Today, net worldwide growth is weak. This leads to reduced demand for new computing devices. Therefore Intel, which does 80% of its business offshore, has been fighting flagging economies and forex headwinds. On the other hand, Intel aimed for and now dominates the server chip market (Data Center segment). No competitor offers a viable response. Accelerating Cloud expansion buttresses Intel management claims for sustainable, mid-teens growth. Turning to the Internet-of-Things and NAND memory, I believe Intel will eventually outpace all comers, too. It may take time, but the endgame tilts heavily to Intel wins. Unsurprisingly, Intel management has gravitated to high-margin businesses. Perhaps the Company will make meaningful inroads into the handset chip market. My opinion is it will do so, but not at the expense of a low-end, low-margin endgame. Net growth prospects? Generally, I accept Intel management and Street consensus whereas Intel will enjoy sustainable, medium-term MSD profit growth. Cash flow is likely to exceed profits, despite Cloud-based capital investment is expected to remain high for the foreseeable future. Top-line growth has been flattish for the past 4 years. Sales growth and gross margins are integral to the to improved earnings and cash flow equation. Cisco Systems' legacy business emphasizes internet switches and routers. Similar to Intel, growth in these product lines is slowing. This doesn't belittle the fact that Cisco, like Intel, is the largest player in its field. Lately, the Company has attempted to diversify into more software and services, a more favorable recurring revenue model. Growth and diversification through acquisition has been a primary inroad. Cisco management has focused upon the wireless business; anticipating a continued data demand explosion. This approach appears to have the potential to move revenues and profits in the right direction. Nevertheless, Cisco management faces similar criticisms that bedevil Intel: Mr. Market cannot shake the fact that flagship switchgear and routers sales aren't growing quickly. These products do continue to dominate the enterprise. Meanwhile, weak global economies (especially emerging markets) and forex headwinds dog earnings, though I envision neither issue terminal. Quite similar to Intel, Cisco has and continues to maintain outstanding margins. So what's the bottom line growth story? The Street indicates Cisco can grow EPS by mid-single-digits. However, the consensus is tempered by fairly divergent views. On one hand, enterprise spend is expected to improve, and with it Cisco's fortunes. On the other hand, the Company faces several significant risks: 1) a great deal of its business is derived from China, 2) multiple acquisitions increase integration risk, and 3) strong competition in some business lines don't afford Cisco a great deal of pricing power. In particular, the NSA scandal hurt Cisco's business in China. Local officials implicated Cisco (a U.S. Corporation) as complicit spying allegations. In response, the Chinese government directed some business transfer to domestic companies. The move exacerbated an already tough price war, and Cisco has lost market share. Good long-term investments are about fine, well-run businesses. It's also about purchasing the stock at a discount to fair value. On a comparative basis, the two stocks exhibit little obvious separation. Intel is cheaper on cash flow; Cisco cheaper on operating earnings. However, after backing out cash and investments, the price/earnings ratio plunges to only 6.1x. In addition, Cisco is advantaged when viewed on a P/FCF basis. This is reasonable since maintenance capex is far lower than Intel. Intel sports a better two-year PEG ratio, though both companies are above the 2.0 marker. This reflects modest earnings growth forecasts. Current Street estimates forecast Intel growing at 6.0% a year in 2016 and 2017, while Cisco is projected to grow EPS at 4.7% annually through fiscal 2017. Price-to-sales ratios are about the same. Using F.A.S.T. graphs, we can see the historical relationship between price and earnings, and price and cash flow. I elected to use an 11-year chart in order to align initial price, earnings, and past / forward growth rates. Intel stock appears undervalued when evaluated by a P/E or P/OCF. Accepting 2016 earnings estimates, and applying a 15x P/E (the orange Graham-Dodd formula figure, below the 16.2x historic average), we arrive at a $34.50 fair value estimate. I believe shaving another multiple point off that for an additional factor of safety. This lowers the projection to $32.20. The FAST graph highlighting operating cash flow suggests a FV of $37.66; the historical 9x P/CF multiple isn't aggressive, so I'm inclined to use the normalized average. A blend of the two results yield ~$35 per share fair value target. That's 18% greater than a recent price, excluding dividends. Estimated FY 2017 earnings per share are forecast to be $2.42. The historic, normalized P/E multiple is 13.4x. The math indicates a $32.43 FV estimate. On cash flow, the story is similar: a $31.24 target is the net result, although I point out the 12x P/CF trimmed average multiple is appreciably higher than Intel. Nonetheless, I accept the higher ratio, given Cisco's better free cash flow. An blended average of the two figures suggest a fair value of $31.80: this is 25% higher than the current bid. The two Tech giants have long instituted robust share repurchase plans. Typically, Tech companies distribute generous stock options to execs and employees. Nonetheless, Intel and Cisco have a demonstrated track record of truly reducing total diluted shares outstanding, though Intel buyback activity has slowed over the past year or so, given high capital requirements and lower free cash flow. Both corporations reward investors with good dividends. Currently, Intel stock yields 3.2%. Recent share price improvement has caused the yield to fall to this level. While the dividend yield is robust versus S&P 500 peers, the dividend growth rate has flattened out. Intel management ties its payout to 40% of its rolling free cash flow. Alternatively, a recent drop in share price has increased CSCO's yield to 3.3%. FCF easily covers the cash dividend. Cisco directors have raised the payout smartly since initiating dividends in 2011. An Intel versus Cisco comparison turned out to be a most interesting exercise, offering expected and unexpected results. These companies own outstanding franchises, possess fortress balance sheets, and spin off loads of cash. I appreciate Intel CEO Brian Krzanich; his recent management shake-up should prove to be a net positive. Alternatively, Cisco Systems has just moved to new CEO Chuck Robbins. I expect the transition from long-term leader John Chambers to be graceful. Intel's answer to slowing PC chip sales is a pivot to rapidly-growing server chips (its Data Center Group), the IoT (Internet of Things), and NAND (flash) memory. The June 2015 announced intent to acquire Altera Corporation (NASDAQ: ALTR ) has particular expectations to advance long-term DCG and IoT strategies. Cisco management has elected grow beyond stagnant internet switch and router products by driving for recurring revenue streams. Emphasis is on software and services; multiple, small acquisitions help drive the process. Turning to share valuation, CSCO shares seem to offer more upside than INTC. However, investors must decide how well either corporation can execute newer growth strategies. Looking backward, relative share price appreciation has been contingent upon the time frame. Over the past 5 years, Intel share appreciation has outpaced Cisco by a wide margin: 58% to 17%. Both companies lagged the S&P 500 over the same period, though dividends helped to close the total return gap. However, over the past one year, CSCO shares have built momentum by outperforming both INTC and the S&P 500 benchmark. If one owned neither stock, CSCO shares seem to have an edge on INTC on relative valuation. Those with longstanding positions in Intel stock (like me) are not likely to be in a rush to swap out. However, while inclined to retain Intel stock, I have a keen eye toward transitioning gradually to Cisco Systems shares. An important data point will be upcoming earnings reports: Intel management has indicated the second half of 2015 will see business acceleration. I'll be watching for that closely.
