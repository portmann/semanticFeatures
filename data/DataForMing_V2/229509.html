What Does 15 Years Of DCF Valuations Tell Us About Disney Now? (Hint: Buy!) - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Disney investors are getting anxious about its increasingly high prices. A discounted cash flow valuation can shed light on whether Disney is overvalued. In my last article on Disney (NYSE: DIS ), I introduced a buying strategy that should outperform the dollar cost averaging strategy. Some readers were quite pleased with the analysis: Other readers requested more analysis on DIS. One reader, Mark07yu, requested I show how I run a discount cash flow analysis. So I'll be taking this opportunity to mix these requests, giving you a walkthrough on how to perform a discount cash flow analysis for any stock. In the entertainment industry, there are followers and there are leaders. Guess which one Disney is. Disney was one of the few famous companies that Warren Buffet failed to optimize. He sold his shares for 50% profit when he "realized" that Disney is nothing but old, stale intellectual property. Other investors shunned Disney as limited in profit-making opportunities. They were wrong. Obviously, to stay around this long and trade at this high of a price, Disney has to be constantly pumping out new stuff, such as movies, which I mentioned in my last analysis on Disney. The famous copywriter Dan Kennedy turned me onto Disney in his constant mentions of how Disney attracts hardcore fans and keeps them paying premium prices to be part of the Disney world. From the marketing perspective, I know their business inside and out; there's not much not to like. Disney profits from every demographic. Low-income groups buy Disney movie tickets. Middle-class families save up some chunks of cash for a trip to the theme parks. The upper class join Disney resort time shares and can shell out a bit more cash while at the theme park to gain a personal guide who lets you cut to the front of the lines. And everything you guys have in the US we have here in Japan - Disney wants everyone's money, regardless of class or geography. And here's their marketing secret: While they do take everyone's money, they do it in a way that isn't casting a broad net. Instead of mimicking Coca Cola (NYSE: C ), a company that believes everyone can enjoy their soda, Disney caters to each group individually, making their products and activities seem exclusive to the consumer. The result is a company that leads the entertainment market in virtually every area. Not because they have the best prices or most interesting movies, but they understand the consumer. But is their stock too expensive? That's where the discounted cash flow analysis comes in. This model allows us to pin a realistic price to a share of a company's stock by estimating the future cash flow of the company and "discounting" it back to today. In the past, I rejected the discounted cash flow (DCF) model for bank holding companies because of the problems inherent in estimating the future cash flow for banks - see my article here for more. But the DCF model can still work pretty well for companies that have positive, stable cash flow. I'm going to walk you through the DCF calculation for Disney. I'm also going to run the model for each financial report from Disney and plot it with Disney's stock price so as to see how the DCF price is related to the true stock price. Everything we need we can get from the fundamental data, which is available for free at Yahoo Finance. I simply loaded it into my statistical software and will show you the out when relevant. Numbers are in billions. We compute the growth rate of the company by dividing the free cash flow by the invested capital. This gives us what is called the Cash Return on Invested Capital (CROIC). The CROIC for the past five years for DIS follow: Because cash is what fuels DIS's growth, these numbers can reflect DIS's growth rate. Essentially, what it's saying is that each $1 invested in DIS is generating $0.108 in cash. But as you can see, these numbers swing wildly, from 0.031 to over 0.1. Thus, we want to "smooth" the numbers by taking the average of the past five numbers. At present, this would be 0.071. For the past five years we have the following five averages: As you can see, these numbers are more stable and "flow" better from one year to the next. For the future cash flow, we estimate the free cash flow growth for the next 20 years by assuming the growth rate will either hold or fall. In this case, we're going to just assume the current growth averages hold for the next 20 years. Summing over all the next 20 years' cash flows gives 75701.00. Now we divide by the discount rate. We will be using 9%, as is standard for old, stable companies such as DIS: We also need to add in the current value. DIS's current total equity is 44958. Adding this to the above number gives the value of 110696.33. Realize that because we must make some assumptions, each analyst's DCF model will vary slightly. For example, you'll see that my calculation is higher than the DCF price estimation given here (DIS is currently trading at $116 but this site states DIS should be valued at $52). So how do you know whether to trust your DCF calculation? Your best bet is to perform the DCF for all the past data as well, charting the DCF value on top of the real stock value. If they move in tandem, the DCF is probably rather trustworthy and can be added to your analysis of the stock. Generally, the DCF should lead the stock price because fundamentals should lead stock price. We see a legitimized fall in the early 2000s, when the DCF valuation was falling at a high pace. Once it evened out and began climbing, the stock price followed suit - until 2008, when the money flowed out of DIS despite the DCF valuation showing that the company wasn't hurt by the financial crisis. This would have been a good time to buy DIS; the model showed a strong company trading at a diminished stock price. As DIS climbed back from the financial crisis, the DCF hadn't moved. The stock was greatly undervalued in 2008 but reached its true price around 2012 to 2013. Now it is shooting quickly upward, moving into overvalued territory. However, the rising DCF valuation is bolstering DIS's ascent. Though this model places DIS at overvalued, it is not a concern, as the company's fundamentals are gaining momentum, which can support record high stock prices. This is why we should look at the trend of the DCF price, which reflects the trend of the company's fundamentals, and not just today's DCF valuation. Going forward, DIS looks like a good play. If you remember my last study, I recommended buying DIS the month before an animated movie is released. With the DCF valuation increasing in tandem to the stock, now's a good time to buy some extra DIS shares.
