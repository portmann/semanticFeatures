Ford's 2016: Will There Be A Dividend Increase? - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha The answer seems to be "yes" based on the factors discussed here. Buying on a dip could present a meaty 5% yield. Ford Motor Co. (NYSE: F ) has now paid the same quarterly dividend of 15 cents per share four times. Even though Ford is not one of the first names that comes to mind when speaking of dividend growth, it's fair to expect an increase in January as the company has done so for three consecutive years. This article presents a few reasons why Ford can afford to increase its dividend and also attempts to predict the dividend increase. Let us get into the details. With a payout ratio of 50% based on adjusted earnings, Ford can easily afford an increase without taxing itself too much. An eight percent increase to 16.2 cents per quarter will only push the payout ratio to 54%, which is still fair. But given the company's and the industry's history, it is prudent to be cautious and not overstretch. Investors must also pay attention to a company's free cash flow (FCF) when looking at dividend coverage. FCF also suggests that Ford could easily afford an increase to 16.2 cents. Total shares outstanding equal 3.9 billion. Multiplying that by 16.2 cents, we get a figure of $630 million that Ford would need in FCF to cover the dividends. The average quarterly FCF over the past five years has been more than double of the required $630 million at around $1.4 billion. Very few quarters over the last five years have seen a FCF below the dividend requirement, as highlighted by the red lines below: Thanks to its cash flow, Ford is also well known for its cash strength. According to Yahoo Finance, the total cash on the company's balance sheet equals $22 billion. This represents an astonishing 39% of Ford's market cap. In other words, the ongoing business is valued only slightly more than what the company has in its reserves. The cash and short-term investments will come handy for paying shareholders as well as during the rainy days. While cash reserves, a modest payout ratio, and past FCF are all good factors to have in your favor, investment decisions must almost always be focused on the future. Ford scores here as well, with the EPS expected to increase by 36% by 2018. So, why did we pick a new quarterly dividend of 16.2 cents when Ford seemingly can afford more? The answer is simple: better safe than sorry. Another reason is that the annual dividend growth rate since the dividend reinstatement has been 100%, 25%, and 20%. It would be foolhardy to expect this scorching pace to continue. The point is to show that even with this conservative estimate, investors can get a 5% yield on cost if they purchase Ford at $13. And before you brush that entry point as impossible, keep in mind that Ford traded hands at $13.01 as recently as September 29, 2015. Most dividend investors look at the 4% yield point and have their own reasons to justify it. Given the industry the company operates in, we believe a higher-than-average yield is required to justify a position in this stock. Obviously, if the dividend is increased by more than 8% (which we believe would be the case), then the floor price would be higher. The rosy picture presented above is not to deny there are any challenges at all for Ford. In fact, the company has little control over its biggest adversities; the macroeconomic factors that affect it but aren't in its control. The biggest headwind is the fickle global economy (or at least the perception). In this industry, we see sales going up and down. News of a 5% increase in China one month is followed by a 3% fall the next month. In addition, while falling gas prices could be viewed as possible incentive for people to drive more, Ford's F-Series and other vehicles that are marketed as "fuel-efficient" lose their biggest selling point if the fuel savings aren't that big a factor anymore. Ford also continues to struggle in markets like Russia. As far as the stock goes, it is well known that it has been stuck in a trading pattern. To really move the needle on the stock and make the big market-moving funds buy in, Ford has to throw something inspiring at investors. International boost from unexpected markets could be one such event. Ford's stock has been one of the "poster boys" when talking about the turnaround since 2008, recovering from as low as $2 to $16 and change. Again, it'd be ridiculous to expect that kind of return anymore, but Ford appears set to be a steady performer over the next few years. Europe continues to get better, China continues to surge and even the "mature" US market is showing positive signs. To piggyback on Ford's slogan, the stock might not go "as further" as it did over the last few years, but could still "Go Further" enough to provide satisfactory returns.
