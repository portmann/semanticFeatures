Amazon Expands One-Hour Delivery Service To Baltimore, Miami â€“ Consumerist It seems that so far, Amazon likes its new one-hour delivery service, which first debuted in New York City in late 2014. So much so that it’s expanding Prime Now service for household products to Baltimore and Miami. Shoppers can get paper towels, shampoo, books, toys, batteries and other everyday items through the app starting Thursday in certain zip codes within Baltimore and Miami, reports the Associated Press , with the company hoping to roll the service out to other zip codes in each city eventually. In the two new cities, Prime Now will be available from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m., seven days a week, in select zip codes for one-hour delivery at $7.99, and free for two-hour delivery. Prime Now will roll out to more cities this year, Amazon says. “Since launching, we’ve seen high demand on everything from essentials like water and paper towels to more surprising deliveries like getting a customer a hard-to-find, top-selling toy in 23 minutes,” said Dave Clark, Amazon’s senior vice president of worldwide operations, in a statement.
