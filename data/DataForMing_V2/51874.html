Carrizo Oil & Gas' (CRZO) CEO Chip Johnson on Q1 2015 Results - Earnings Call Transcript | Seeking Alpha Chip Johnson - President and Chief Executive Officer David Pitts - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Brad Fisher - Vice President and Chief Operating Office Andy Agosto - Vice President of Business Development Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Carrizo Oil & Gas First Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, May 6 of 2015. Thank you all for calling in. As we always do, our CFO, David Pitts, will go over the financial results, then I’ll go over the operation status, then we will open it up to Q&A. So, David, do you want to get started? Sure, thanks, Chip, and good morning, everyone. Oil production for the quarter was 21,373 barrels per day. This exceeded the high-end of our guidance, due primarily to strong performance from our Eagle Ford assets. Gas and NGL production for the quarter was 79,333 Mcfe per day, which also exceeded the high-end of guidance, due primarily to lower than expected levels of voluntary curtailments in the Marcellus and higher than expected NGL production from non-operated wells in the Utica. First quarter revenues of $100 million included $83 million attributable to oil revenues. During the quarter, we realized 89% of NYMEX for oil revenues, which was within the range of our guided realization. And we also realized 85% of NYMEX for gas and NGL revenues, which also exceeded the high-end of the range of our guided realization. Total cost and expenses for the quarter were $47.3 million and were within the range of guidance. DD&A for the first quarter was $23.72 per Boe, which was below our range of guidance, primarily due to the reduction of future development costs of our crude undeveloped reserves, reflecting the approximate 10% reduction in drilling cost and 20% reduction in completion cost we had realized by the end of the first quarter. Adjusted net income was $6.4 million or $0.14 per diluted share which exceeded consensus earnings estimates of $0.03 per diluted share. Drilling and completion capital expenditures for the quarter were $151.6 million, 68% of which was in the Eagle Ford, this is a lower percentage attributable to Eagle Ford than prior quarters. This is because, during the first quarter, we incurred the majority of our 2015 drilling and completion capital expenditures for the Utica and Niobrara. As mentioned in the press release, due to the cost savings and efficiencies realized in our drilling program, we are decreasing our drilling and completion capital expenditure plan for the year by $10 million. We ended the first quarter with net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.25 times. This ratio is computed in accordance with our credit facility and includes on a pro forma basis, the historical pre-acquisition EBITDA associated with the Eagle Ford minerals acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2014. Included in the press release is our second-quarter and full-year 2015 guidance table. The table reflects the increased production guidance and the reduced capital expenditures guidance for the full year, as discussed in the press release, as well as updated DD&A guidance for the full year. Full-year 2015 guidance remains unchanged for all other costs and expenses. For the second quarter of 2015, we expect to realize 91% to 93% of NYMEX for oil revenues, and 72% to 80% of NYMEX for gas and NGL revenues. Beginning in this quarter we have also included these commodity price realizations in the guidance table. We currently have hedges in place for approximately 70% of our production for the balance of 2015, consisting of collars on approximately 15,800 barrels a day with $50 floors and $67 ceilings. We also have hedges in place for 2016, consisting of collars on 4,000 barrels a day, also at $50 floors and $77 ceilings. In addition to these hedge positions, we also continue to receive the benefit from the offsetting crude-oil hedge transactions we entered into in February 2015, which locked in additional cash flows of $119 million for the next three quarters of 2015 and $45 million for calendar 2016. Based on oil and gas prices as of May 4, 2015, we expect to receive $43 million to $44 million from derivatives settlements during the second quarter of 2015. This includes settlements on our existing oil and gas hedges, as well as settlements of our offsetting crude oil hedge positions. Please refer to the hedging tables included in the press release for further details. In March of 2015, we completed an equity offering for net proceeds of $232 million, which were used to repay borrowings outstanding under our revolver. And in April of 2015, we issued $615 million of 6.25% senior notes due 2023. This was to refinance our $600 million 8.625% senior notes due 2018. Only 44% of the 8.625% senior notes were tendered in April at a total cost of $277 million. As a result on May 14, we will redeem the remaining 56% of these senior notes, at a total cost of $353 million. As of April 30, we had nothing drawn on our revolver and $257 million of cash on hand. Pro forma for the May 14 redemption of the remaining 8.625% senior notes, we would have $96 million outstanding under the revolver. Recently, our credit facility was amended to establish an approved borrowing base of $685 million, which is equal to our existing commitment amount. This $685 million borrowing base is slightly higher than the $675 million estimate we provided during our fourth quarter earnings call back in February. Based on existing bank pricing, we expect our borrowing base will increase to approximately $735 million in connection with the next redetermination scheduled for the fall of 2015. Thanks, David. Despite the challenging commodity price environment during the quarter, our management team is pleased to report another outstanding quarter for the company. Our net oil production of 21,373 BOPD was up 42% year-over-year. While we are currently choosing to hold our full-year 2015 oil production roughly flat with the fourth quarter of 2014, we do expect to exit 2015 with a year-over-year increase in production. With our combination of high-return assets, operational flexibility, and a strong balance sheet, we are well positioned to resume strong production growth as commodity prices improved. In the Eagle Ford, we are producing from 210 gross, or 184 net wells with three drilling rigs running in one 24/7 frac crew. During the first quarter, Carrizo drilled 14 gross or 12.2 net operated wells, completed 16 gross or 14.5 net wells. Crude oil production from the play was approximately 18,700 BOPD for the quarter. At the end of the quarter, Carrizo had 23 gross or 19.9 net operated Eagle Ford Shale wells waiting on completion, equating to net crude oil production potential of more than 7,500 barrels per day. Carrizo currently expects to drill approximately 65 gross, or 58 net operated wells in frac, 64 gross or 57 net wells in the play during 2015. We are currently developing our Eagle Ford Shale acreage on a combination of 330-foot and 500-foot spacing, with approximately 65% of our drilling inventory based on 330-foot spacing. Downspacing to 330 feet on our remaining Eagle Ford Shale acreage would add another approximately 115 net locations to our drilling inventory. We currently have four two-well pads online in these areas and have three additional 330 foot space pads scheduled to come online in the first-half of the year. We are pleased with the early production data, as the performance from these wells looks similar to that of wells drilled of wider spacing. We have also begun testing of a stagger stack concept in the Lower Eagle Ford, which may allow us to further reduce effect of lateral spacing in the lower Eagle Ford below 330 feet, and downspaced areas will be initially drilled on wider spacing. Additionally, we plan to start a test of the Upper Eagle Ford on our acreage in the third quarter. We think approximately 25% of our acreage could be prospective for the Upper Eagle Ford. We have continued to add bolt-on acres to our position in the Eagle Ford Shale. Our position in the trend now stands at approximately 83,200 net acres following the addition of about 12,000 net acres since late February. In the Utica, we recently brought online our third and fourth operated wells from Wagler 1H and 2H in Guernsey County. We are pleased with the early results, as each well averaged more than 500 barrels a day of condensate over the 17-day test period. And each well was still producing more than 500 barrels a day of condensate when they were shut in at the end of April. We are working with Mark West and hope to have these wells hooked up to sales during the third quarter. We currently have 22,900 net drillable acres in the condensate window of the trend. We think that equates to more than 150 net potential locations on 150 acre spacing. In the Niobrara, we are producing from 112 gross, or 46 net wells with 16 gross or 5.6 net wells waiting on completion at the end of the quarter, representing about 1,300 net BOPD of potential initial production. We remain pleased with the performance of our Niobrara A-bench tests, as they continue to perform in line with our expectations for B-bench wells. We have also been impressed by Whiting’s Codell test in the area. About 30% of our acreage has at least as much thickness as their wells, and we will continue to watch their performance. In the Marcellus, we are producing from 82 gross, 26.3 net wells, in Susquehanna in Wyoming County, Pennsylvania, with gas sales in the three major pipelines. We continue to limit our production volumes from the area when prices get too low and have a production capacity from the area well above our current rates. As a result, 2015 production volumes will vary based on the strength of local market prices. For the second quarter, total Company oil production is expected to range between 21,400 and 21,800 net barrels of oil per day. For gas and NGL, second-quarter production should range between 68 and 74 net million cubic feet equivalent per day. Our 2015 drill and complete budget moves down to $440 million to $460 million, as a result of cost reductions and efficiencies. 2015 land CapEx remains unchanged at $35 million. At this total level of spending, we expect to be able to generate mid-single-digit exit rate growth in 2015; maintain a strong backlog of wells to complete once commodity prices improve; and keep our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio below 3 times. This should position us to be able to quickly accelerate our production growth as commodity prices improve. So, the near-term catalyst would be Eagle Ford 330-foot downspacing. We should have some results in the next 90 days. Longer-term in the second-half, we should have some results on Eagle Ford stagger stack and Upper Eagle Ford test; Delaware Basin farm outs and leasing; and, potentially a Codell test in the Niobrara. So, to sum up before the Q&A, we expect steady sequential oil production growth through the year; better-than-expected service cost reductions are letting us reduce CapEx; and our strong balance sheet is allowing us to look at new opportunities, primarily in the Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin. [Operator Instructions] One moment please for the first question. Our first question today comes from the line of Will Green from Stephens. Your line is open. Please proceed with your question. So we’ve recently seen some strong well results from Eagle Ford and other areas, and I think other operators have sighted higher amounts of proppant. I know you guys have been kind of on the leading edge of really pumping a lot of proppant into the wellbore. As you guys look at these cost reductions you’ve seen in the Eagle Ford and another places, is that an area where you guys would potentially look at pushing that further and applying some more science to the well, or do you guys feel like you’ve kind of exhausted kind of the possibilities of enhancing the EURs on that front and now it’s more of a cost game? I wonder if you could just talk about how you view that balance right now, or if you are actually seeing - if you’ve seen the diminishing returns of the pumping things like more sand? Will, this is Brad Fisher. We have just recently fracked a couple of wells. We had a four-well pad. We did two of them with our standard 1,600 pounds per foot of sand concentration and we fracked another two on the same pad with 2,000 pounds per foot. The incremental cost on that runs about $13,000 a stage for us. So we expect probably sometime in third quarter that we’ll go and get an indication of how successful the increase sand concentration is. And based on that that pilot, we’ll make a decision on a go forward on adding some additional sand to some other completions. In addition to the sand concentration, we’ve had several wells now where we have pumped Halliburton diverter into - put that as part of our frac jobs. So we are looking for some data on that probably third quarter as well. So, we certainly haven’t given up by any means on optimizing how we frac the Eagle Ford wells. Great. I appreciate the color. And then, maybe talk a little bit about refracs. It’s something we’ve heard quite a bit about here in the last few months. And I wonder if you guys had a take on it, if it’s an opportunity for you guys and if it’s something you are looking at or plan to do anytime soon? Well, we’re a proponent of refracs. We are waiting for the industry to - the service industry to figure out how to do it efficiently. I mean, refracs have worked in conventional plays and shale plays. We re-fracked a horizontal well in the Barnett. It was a short lateral, which made it pretty easy to do, and we have very good results back in about 2007. So we are a proponent of it. And we would like to see the service companies come up with a way to do it. The mechanical isolation of the zones is the hard part. And whether you can do that with diverters, or some sort of vault to plug off the perfs, or whether you have to cement the well and start over, we are open to suggestions. But we haven’t seen anything yet that makes us want to start spending money. Will, this is Brad Fisher. I just want to add one thing to that. A lot of the talk around refracs has been targeted at wells that were initially under-stimulated, either longer frac intervals or lower sand concentrations. We’ve been very consistent on the Eagle Ford since starting of shorter frac intervals in large sand concentrations. So we want to see industry progress into the what we’ll call the properly fracked well and see how refracs work on there before we make a decision on how far we’ll go with that. Our next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann from SunTrust. Your line is open. Please proceed with your question. Good morning, guys. Chip, could you talk a little bit about the down spacing of 330 foot, 500 foot? Again, how many locations is that going to work in most of your Eagle Ford as well as the stagger stack concept a little bit? Well, if we can down space that 330 feet in the virgin areas we haven’t drilled already, that adds about 150 net wells. If we can stagger stack then we might be able to down space that again. That would essentially double the amount of wells you could drill. And I think we said that could be as many as 900 wells. That spacing is getting very tight and we are drilling a well now to test that. So it’s fairly risky that we will be able come up with that many locations. But the other thing we want to do is figure out if we can go back into the areas we drilled on 1,000 foot or 750 foot spacing or even 500 spacing. And even though they’ve been producing for a couple of years maybe we can stagger stack that and that could add a few more locations. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Corales from Howard Weil. Your line is open. Please proceed with your question. Yes, good morning. Kind of on the same topic, has anyone done kind of a 160 foot stagger stack well in the Eagle Ford? Hey, Brian, this is Andy Agosto. We are not aware of an actual stagger stack at that spacing, no. From the data we can see publicly, there are clearly wells being drilled tighter than 330, but we’re just not sure whether any of those are staggered or not. Okay. And then kind of on the same concept, if you were on the water space wells, I guess, you drilled three or four years ago. I mean, would you have to shut in that pad to put the stagger stack - to put that other well in there if you were to down space from that method? Yes. I mean, that’s clearly an issue with any drilling around - drilling and fracking around existing production. We tend to build that into the forecast. From a drilling standpoint, no, I don’t think we would be shutting production in. From a completion standpoint, we would, but that’s kind of normal course of business for us. Any well that’s within 2,000 feet or 3,000 feet, we typically shut in. Okay. I mean, just one more if I could. Chip, you talked about the higher prices, kind of waiting for some of these to complete or not completing all of the wells for higher prices. Are we getting close to that point where maybe we could start seeing you all whittle down that backlog? Well, we haven’t been trying to build a backlog. I guess the backlog in the Niobrara has gone up, but we will frac three of those wells shortly. But at some price and we have said in the past, we are comfortable that oil is going to be $65 for a long time, we could add a fourth rig and that would probably be in Eagle Ford. But we’re not ready to make that call yet. I think we would be jumping the gun to do anything before the OPEC meeting in June, and see what happens then. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rowe of Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company. Your line is open. Please proceed with your question. Good morning. I had a couple of quick questions on the Eagle Ford. I guess first would be on the Upper Eagle Ford, can you talk about how thick that is, where you are planning to target it on the western side of your acreage position? The section is there is comparable in thickness to the Lower Eagle Ford in spots the total section may even be a little bit thicker. But as we’ve talked about in the past, whenever we’ve discussed the Upper Eagle Ford, the issue there is hydrocarbon storage, so we’re looking for porosity. And generally what we would consider net pay in the Upper Eagle Ford is considerably less than the Lower Eagle Ford. The big issue in the Upper Eagle Ford and again, we’ll just refer you back to the Analyst Day is there is a formation we call an ash bed that separates the Upper and the Lower Eagle Ford, it’s a clay formation. And the $64,000 question is whether that’s going to seal, post frac. And so we should be able to ascertain that with the test that Chip mentioned that we’ll be drilling this year. Okay, fair enough. And I guess on the Delaware Basin and I guess there wasn’t much to talk about on the press release. But can you just comment on nearby drilling activity in your areas of exposure? I’m just curious if you are seeing any material changes to cost structure or other interesting data points from offset operators? Thank you. I think the most activity in our area has been from BHP and also from EOG, and the well results just seem to get better and better. So we still don’t have a good handle on cost, because we haven’t drilled or fracked a well yet. We are still working on a farm on a farm out. We’re closer to getting it than we were two weeks ago. But looking at the BHP wells, the Horseshoe Springs wells are the best thing to compare to. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Glick from Johnson Rice. Your line is open. Please proceed with your question. Good morning guys. I know you took delivery of those newbuild rigs in the Eagle Ford. What sort of efficiency gains should we expect there? I think at Analyst Day, we’re predicting the generation three rigs to go from about 1.8 wells per rig to up to about 2.1. So and we seem to be on schedule for that, so that’s what I would use in your model. Gotcha. And then maybe just from a high level or higher level, what inning do you think we are in, in terms of efficiency gains in the Eagle Ford? And then maybe what inning are in, in terms of recovery factors in the Eagle Ford? This is Brad Fisher. I’ll address the inning for the efficiency. I think probably the bottom of the eighth, I think there’s smaller gains to be made, but they are going to be more slug it out type stuff. I mean, our average Eagle Ford well now is run in 10 to 12 days on a 6,700 foot lateral. And we see incremental gains, but they are small, and we talked about it at Analyst Day. It is kind of slugging it out from here. We do get a little bigger jumps when we bring on these new generation rigs and new generation tools. But I think the eighth inning is where we are at. On the EUR side, this is Andy Agosto. I think we’re probably six to seventh inning. One thing that we have to remember here is the most mature Eagle Ford well has probably been online for five years or less. And I think if we’ve been able to prove anything in this industry and in particular with respect to resource plays, shale plays, is that we’ve figured out ways to get more out of this rock. We’ve started out with pretty low recovery efficiencies and we’ve consistently been able to up that. Brad earlier talked about a couple of different things we are trying on the completion front. And there may be some things down the road that we don’t even know of yet, but these are 30 to 40 year life type wells. And I think we will see continued improvement in EUR. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Braziller from Jefferies. Your line is open, please proceed with your question. Hello everyone. Thank you for taking my question. Just jumping over to the Utica, I was hoping you guys could discuss the pressure drawdowns you have seen specifically on Brown compared to Wagler and maybe also compared to the Rector well? And just kind of wondering what type of pressures you have seen on Brown? What type of decline you would anticipate from this point forward? Thanks. Good morning, Dan, this is Jim Pritts. With respect to the Brown and Wagler and Rector wells, is important to understand their relative structural positions and location North and South in the play. The Rector and Wagler wells are at about the same structural depth, some 20 miles apart. And when we tested the Wagler wells, we primarily tested those for a short time frame because since they are on strike with the Rector, we expected them to be very good wells. And indeed, they were, and we were more interested in getting fluid samples to kind of refine our understanding of the facilities that we would need in stabilization around those wells. So the Wagler wells were very Rector like. The Brown well is some 6 miles up depth of the Wagler wells. So if you go up depth, it’s about 6 miles away and some 400 foot to 500 foot shallower from a structural standpoint. And we are very pleased with the Brown well relative to other wells in that structural position. We have averaged over 400 barrels a day. For the Brown and we are on day 100 of the flow test for the Brown, so the well is doing well. It is some 30% less on those than our type well in length. Our type well is 8,000 foot and it is on order of 6,200 foot in length. So it continues to flow, last test a day or so ago was 340 barrels a day plus over 1 million cubic feet a day plus. With respect to be exact pressure differences, between the Rector, Wagler and the Brown, we view that somewhat competitive and prefer not to get into that. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Dan McSpirit from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please proceed with your question. Thank you, and good morning. First two questions on economic limits. How do the economic break evens of the Upper and Lower Eagle Ford shale differ? Appreciating the data may be limited with the Upper Eagle Ford. And then secondly, how do those breakeven prices compared to what you’re see in the Permian basin, again appreciating that the data may be limited given your limited operating history in that basin? Hey Dan, this is Andy Agosto. I think getting back to my comment earlier about whether that ash bed seals. If it does not, our anticipation is that the Upper Eagle Ford is going to look very much like a Lower Eagle Ford well. If it does seal and it is an independent reservoir, it’s going to be more chalk like. We’re not sure at this point what the EURs are going to look like in that scenario. It would be hard to comment at this point. As far as the Permian comparing it to the Eagle Ford, there are a lot of moving pieces as well costs, differentials, the amount of gas. We think the better performing Permian wells look very Eagle Ford like in terms of economics. And so for us, we think where we are going to be drilling, where our initial wells will be in that area. So we believe it’s going to be competitive with our Eagle Ford. Great. And as a follow-up to that, if we believe strip pricing and maybe the lack of much of a Contango in the shape of the curve today, maybe you could conclude that opportunities for acquisitions will be greater tomorrow than they are today. Maybe as a reality of low for longer prices sets in and producers further struggle to make it work, do you agree with that statement? And if so, does that mean the M&A window could open again or open wider going forward? I guess I support your plan as somebody who wants to make acquisitions. But I read way too many reports where people think it is going to be a U-shaped recovery. And it just depends on where that lacks on the right leg on the U is, whether a year from now or five years now. But, the Contango dropping like it did should help us eventually to bid/ask should start shrinking and people will start getting a little market therapy and be willing to sell something. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Stevens from KeyBanc. Your line is open. Please proceed with your question. Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. Can you just talk a little bit about how you balance increasing activity levels next year between your different areas? Oil prices are in the upper 60s I think in your press release you mentioned wanting to increase activity levels in the Utica a little bit. But the economics are obviously a little bit better in Eagle Ford, so how do we think about that dynamic through next year? I think it all depends on oil price. Not only because it gives us more cash flow to invest but the effect of the big differentials has less bearing. The Eagle Ford right now has a low differential like $2 below WTI, whereas the Niobrara is still higher than that $6 to $10. The Permian as higher than - or is around $10. Utica seems to be around $8 to $10. So as long as those differentials stay there, the Eagle Ford is going to always command the dollars. But if prices go up enough, then that shrinks - or the impact of that differential doesn’t have the same bearing, and we’d probably think more about drilling in some of these other areas. Okay. So I guess it sounds like you would be more likely to just kind of add a rig in the Eagle Ford and go from there if commodity prices go higher then add to other areas? Yes, that would be safe through 2016, and in 2017 we’d probably start thinking about holding acreage in the Utica. But we don’t really have to spend much money until 2017 on Utica acreage holds. We really don’t have to spend much money anywhere else on that. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Connolly from Clarkson Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please proceed with your question. Hi guys. Service costs seem to be running a bit ahead of schedule. Do you think there is more room to lower costs? And then, how do you think about the cost reductions you have achieved as crude starts to recover a little bit more maybe heading into 2016 and 2017? Jeffrey, this is Brad Fisher. So far, we are a bit ahead of what we projected. Right now, we are running on the oil - or on the Eagle Ford side. We are at about 10% on the drilling and about 23.5% almost 24% on the completion side. If we kind of hold that constant for the rest of the year, assuming we maintain that, we’re going to basically come out of just a little bit of ahead of what we predicted in our models. Going forward, on the drilling and completion side, I think there is a little bit of room there. Once again, I think it’s going to be kind of slugging it out from here forward if we see commodity prices start to come up and we see activity pick up, the discounts are directly tied to activity levels. So if activity levels come up, the discounts are going to stay stable and at some point they are going to start to erode. At the price level we are at right now, it’s hard to fathom that, it’s going to - they are going to erode a lot more but I just don’t see them really coming up a lot on the drilling complete side. Well, if there are no further questions, we will wrap it up. Just to sum up, I think we are one of the healthiest small cap company’s at these oil prices. We have been able to improve the balance sheet in the first quarter both with the equity offering and the restructuring of our bonds. We have - we beat the high end of our oil production guidance and now we should have sequential growth all through this year. We are poised to be able to ramp up if we see a significant increase in oil prices. And maybe the market for acquisitions is going to get a little better as some people start saying that they need the money as we get closer to the next re-determinations. With that, I would like to thank the staff and the management for doing such a good job of dealing with these low oil prices. And we’ll talk again in 90 days. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask you please disconnect your lines.

Carrizo Oil & Gas, Inc. released its FQ4 2013 Results in their Earnings Call on May 07, 2015.
