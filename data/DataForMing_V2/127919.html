Check your browser settings or contact your network administrator. As is Apple’s usual M.O. when it comes to launching products similar to those made by other companies but already being sold in its retail stores, the tech giant is cleaning house and removing the competition. In this case, it’s ditching Google’sÂ Nest thermostat to make room forÂ a device of its own.Â  Mashable confirmed today that Apple has removed Google’s Nest products from its online and retail stores as it prepares to start selling its web-connected home devices for the HomeKit platform. Apple says it actually started to pull Nest from its arsenal earlier this month after nearly four years of carrying the device. The move also comes soon after Google announced it would create its own HomeKit-like platform called Brillo, Mashable reports. Back in March, the company began ditching other fitness and health wearables like Jawbone Up and Nike+ FuelBand to make way for the Apple Watch.Â The company did the same thing last October when it began removing Bose products from stores after the purchase of Beats.
