Verizon's $2.4B Fleetmatics deal at 'healthy' multiple - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha Aug  1 2016, 11:36 ET | About: Verizon Communications (VZ) | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Verizon's ( VZ -0.8%) $2.4B deal for Fleetmatics ( FLTX +38.7%) didn't come as a surprise to Citigroup analyst Kenneth Wong, who noted an "aggressive pace" of consolidation in the sector. Verizon had announced a deal in June to buy fleet-management software maker Telogis as well. The Fleetmatics deal is in line with recent transaction multiples of 6 to 9 time recurring revenue, Wong says. “There has been significant consolidation across the fleet management space from across the auto ecosystem (OEMs, telco, pure play FMS vendors (FLTX mainly), fuel card providers, etc.) so we believe the bidding process was competitive," he writes. RBC's Matthew Hedberg calls it a "healthy multiple," saying the deal reflects "6.1x FTM EV/S vs. 5.1x for software acquisitions." Despite today's jump, Fleetmatics at $59.60 isn't quite that stock's 52-week high: It hit $62.86 in December and had fallen 31.7% since then.
