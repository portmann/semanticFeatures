Apple raises record debt Down Under - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Aug 21 2015, 03:53 ET | About: Apple Inc. (AAPL) | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has raised A$2.25B ($1.6B) with a debut "Kangaroo" bond issue, smashing the record for the largest-ever corporate bond deal in Australia. The iPhone maker sold A$1.15B of seven-year notes at a yield of 110 bps more than swap rates and A$1.1B of four-year securities at a 65 bps spread, bringing its total debt issuances over the past two years to $50B. Apple had only sold U.S. currency bonds until last November, but has since expanded to euros, yen, pounds, Swiss francs and Aussie dollars. Brilliant move, taking advantage of cheap credit which soon might start to dry. It shows the financial status and sound financial health. Yesterday dramatic fall of Netflix and others showed what can be a start to deflate overvalued stocks made by investors ready to buy the news and analyst hype based on future profits that can be elusive. Soon we will see some movement to quality, where Apple revenues, dividend and low p/e make it an ideal candidate.
