Bet On Apple Music's Success By Buying Vivendi - Vivendi SA (OTCMKTS:VIVEF) | Seeking Alpha Apple introduced its music streaming service Apple Music. However, music related revenue and profits is not significant for Apple. Some may call it a historic day for the music industry, others may just call it the introduction of another online streaming service. Either way, the new music service of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has been a subject of discussion for several weeks now. Apple Music closed some last-minute deals with independent music labels in order to make sure they were able to offer a full catalog of music through this new platform. On Tuesday, Apple Music finally became available for consumers. Apple Music will offer a paid-only subscription service for music streaming after the trial period of three months comes to an end. The subscription is priced at $9.99 per month, comparable to other paid subscription streaming services like Spotify. Up until the introduction of Apple Music, Apple relied on its online music catalog iTunes. Apple introduced iTunes in 2003 and it proved to be the answer to large scale online piracy. Despite the success of iTunes, consumers started to change their behavior lately. This change resulted in a shift toward fast growing online streaming service providers. Streaming service provider Spotify already totaled over 75 million active monthly users in June. Not surprisingly, Apple's iTunes related revenue is under pressure for some time now. Apple Music should be considered less innovative than the introduction of iTunes in 2003. However, the change is necessary considering the changing behavior of consumers. Apple is rumored to aim at 100 million paying subscribers this year. In case Apple will reach 100 million subscribers, total streaming revenue will equal the current quarterly iTunes revenue of $3.1 billion (see this source and this source) based on the following sum: 100 million users * $9.99 subscription fee * 3 months. Investors could anticipate the success of Apple Music by buying Apple's shares. However, I find that there is another interesting opportunity for investors: buying shares of a record label. In this article, I will argue that streaming revenue will boost music industry revenue in general and record labels' revenue in particularly. There are two major record labels listed, namely Sony (NYSE: SNE ) and Vivendi ( OTCPK:VIVEF ). Sony owns Sony Music and Vivendi owns industry leader Universal Music Group. For now, I will focus on Vivendi because the company's dependence on music revenue is higher than Sony's. For example, Vivendi's music related revenue was €4.56 billion ($5.06 billion) or 45% of total revenue (see Q4 report) and music related EBITA was €565 million ($627 million) or 57% of total EBITA in 2014. To make my case for owning shares of Vivendi instead of streaming service providers like Apple, let's consider the royalty split between Apple and record labels such as Universal Music Group. Apple officially stated the company will pay at least 71.5% of subscription revenue to the music industry (see this article). The music industry covers a broad range of participants, including labels, publishers and artists. These parties split the remaining revenue. Labels and artists are in most cases connected through a record deal. There are two types of deals. First there is an artist deal. With an artist deal, the label acquires the master rights from the artist and becomes the ultimate owner of all revenue. As compensation, the artist receives a relatively small royalty percentage (typically between 6% and 12%). Second there is a license deal. The artist remains the ultimate beneficial owner of the master rights, but licenses the label to use the rights for a set period of time. In this case, the record label also collects all royalty payments for the songs and pays a part of it to the artist. Depending on the sort license deal, the artist's stake is likely to be higher compared to an artist deal. Now, how much of the $9.99 monthly subscription of Apple Music revenue will stick with record labels? To clear this, I will provide an example in the table below. For this example, I assumed an artist deal between the label and the artist with a royalty percentage of 12% for the artist. Based on the calculation above, record labels earn most of the revenue from the subscription streaming services like Apple Music. Record labels earn over 40% of total revenue. This amount is even higher than Apple's own revenue share of 23%. Naturally, the outcome of the calculation above differs from case to case. However, this article on Music Business Worldwide supports my example described above. For the music industry, it is important that companies like Apple sell more subscription-based streaming services in favor of free streaming services. Spotify does have 75 million active users, but only 20 million of them are actually paying users. According to the Wall Street Journal, a single play on Spotify Premium was worth around $0.0068 compared to $0.0014 for Spotify Free (see this article). Up until now, streaming service providers were not able to convert free streaming users into paying users. The music industry hopes Apple will make a difference in this area, but investors should note that a high conversion ratio of Apple Music users after the three months trial period is far from certain. It is clear that increasing total subscription-based streaming services is very important for the music business because of the simple fact that subscription-based services earn more money. Apple stated it aims to sell around 100 million subscriptions annually. If successful, Apple covers the lost revenue from iTunes (currently around $12.4 billion each year). Up until 100 million paying users, there is not much additional money to be earned for record labels. But how about Apple topping 100 million paying users in the long run? Apple has 800 million iTunes users and as many credit card records according to this source. For sure, there are a lot of inactive accounts. Still, Apple's potential market is 400 million users in case only half of all accounts are active. In my opinion, Apple should be able to top the 100 million subscribers over a longer period of time. Naturally, there is the possibility that Apple will not meet its target. In that case, there is no direct need to panic. Apple Music will not replace iTunes, it will exist next to iTunes. Therefore, consumers who are not willing to pay for the Apple Music subscription (e.g. less active users) are still able to occasionally buy songs from the iTunes library. So, iTunes revenue will definitely decline, but it will not completely vanish. As I mentioned, things get really interesting if Apple will be able to meet 100 million paid users. For comparison, I will show the total royalty payments based on 100 million music streaming subscribers below. Some may argue that this calculation is over the top, but since there is no actual reference I feel comfortable using Apple's own estimation. Record labels are looking at $4.8 billion of royalty income. On top of that, there might also be a small residual revenue from the iTunes 'a la carte' download service. My projections are not unlikely. Here is an interesting piece covering the potential of streaming revenue. According to one of Vivendi's shareholders, music streaming revenue will grow to $16.4 billion by the end of 2020. At the time of the report, Apple had not announced Apple Music yet. The introduction of Apple Music could be an extra support for meeting this estimation of music streaming revenue. Again, the final outcome and conversion rate after the three months trial period is still uncertain. Despite the uncertainty regarding total paying users for Apple Music, it is interesting to invest in Vivendi's record label. The Music industry recognized the importance of converting non-paying users into paying users. the increased efforts to sell subscription streaming services will benefit record labels' revenue and income. One of the most important measures for Apple Music and other music streaming service providers is the release of exclusive tracks for paying users. Apple Music already signed its first exclusive deal with Sony-signed Pharell Williams (see this article). Spotify also provides exclusive tracks for paying users. As I mentioned, investors might want to consider an investment in Vivendi's record label. Vivendi is the parent company of Universal Music Group, the largest music company in the world controlling around 30% of the global music business. Universal Music Group has several record labels representing a large and diversified portfolio of national and international artists. Just take a look at the line-up of artists on the company's corporate website (see here ). Universal is also the leading global music publisher and owns the largest online music video platform VEVO with over 5.5 billion views per month. Overall, Universal is engaged in almost every aspect of the music industry. The combination of both record labels and music publishing is particularly interesting. Based on my revenue breakdown, music publishers will receive a significant portion of music streaming revenue. As Vivendi owns the leading record business and publishing business in the world, the company will take an both pieces of the music streaming slice. Considering the significant portion of Universal's revenue (45%) and EBITA (57%) in Vivendi's total revenue and EBITA, any additional revenue from subscription streaming services like Apple Music will support Vivendi's financial performance going forward. Naturally, this will be positive for the share price as well. Note that there were some rumors in the past about a potential spin off of Universal Music Group. P. Schoenfeld Asset Management argued that Vivendi's music business is significantly undervalued due to the company's corporate structure. A spin off would unlock tremendous shareholder value. Naturally, there are several risk factors to consider before making an investment decision. As streaming becomes more popular, more free streaming services become available (e.g. Soundcloud). The music industry tries everything to fight these platforms because they do not pay royalties to the owners of the music rights. Another risk factor is Apple Music not able to convert users into paying users after the three months trial period. Apple's ambition of 100 million paid users is healthy, but needs to be realized first. I expect Apple to be successful in converting users into paid users after the three months trial period comes to an end. Consumer behavior is changing from 'traditional' downloads towards online streaming services. The 70 million users of Spotify are a good example of this trend (note only 20 million are paying). Before the introduction of Apple Music, one of Vivendi's active shareholders estimated total streaming revenue of $16 billion by the end of 2020. Apple Music might contribute to achieving this goal. Investors could benefit from the success of Apple Music and other streaming services by buying Apple's shares. However, I find there is a much more attractive way to benefit from the focus on streaming music services. Investors should consider buying Vivendi instead. This French stock is the parent company of Universal Music Group. Universal is the number one music company in the world and includes several leading record labels, a publishing business and an online video platform with over 5.5 billion views. As I argued in this article, record labels earn a higher royalty percentage from streaming revenue than any other party in the music industry. Record labels earn around 40% in royalty income from the total subscription fee. This article even argued record labels' royalty percentage to be 59%. To place this amount into perspective, Apple only earns 23% from gross subscription revenue. Therefore, an investment in a record label is a more attractive investment to benefit from increasing streaming revenue than an investment in Apple. I prefer Vivendi over Sony because of the company's market leading position and higher reliance on music related revenue.
