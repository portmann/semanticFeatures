Apple Reports A Stellar Quarter, Outlook Also Solid - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple blew out top and bottom line results as revenue beat by $2 billion and EPS beat by $0.18. Outlook on revenue and margins indicates that Apple can blow past next quarter consensus analyst estimates. The expansion of the buyback and dividend program adds momentum to the stock. I anticipate Apple to report EPS of $1.84 for Q3' FY 2015. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) reported yet another blowout quarter, and I guess it's not all that surprising, when taking into consideration the company has such an amazing track record of low-balling its gross margin/revenue outlook. Apple reported EPS of $2.34, which exceeded analyst estimates of $2.16. Needless to say, foreign exchange reared its ugly head as the dollar continues to appreciate against a basket of currencies. However, Apple was prepared as it had currency hedges and made pricing adjustments to its product line in foreign markets. Unit volume grew by 40%, and revenue grew by 55% year-over-year in the iPhone product segment. The year-over-year increase in ASP was driven by a sales mix shift to higher memory configuration/larger form factor iPhone devices. Admittedly, the iPad segment experienced another downward slide, which was driven by both falling ASPs and drop in unit volume. I anticipate that this trend will eventually stabilize in FY 2016, as I anticipate iPad users to eventually update their devices as there's a large population of first/third generation iPad devices still in use today. The Mac segment grew by 10% year-over-year whereas revenue grew by 2%. The Mac segment saw a minor drop in ASPs, which was driven by the pricing changes in its lower-tier MacBook products in Q1 of FY 2015. With the release of the MacBook (ultra-portable weighing only 2lbs and thinner than the MacBook Air), I anticipate that ASPs for the Mac segment will trend higher for the duration of FY 2015, as pricing for the new MacBook ranges from $1,300 to $1,600. The current ASP for the Mac segment is $1,230, which fell from $1258 from the year ago period. The outlook, according to the quarterly earnings conference call: Now, as we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $46 billion and $48 billion, compared to $37.4 billion in the year ago quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 38.5% and 39.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $5.65 billion and $5.75 billion. We expect YNE to be about $350 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 26.3%. - Luca Maestri (SVP and CFO of Apple) Let me tell you, there are a number of reasons why our guidance for gross margins is lower than the actual for the second quarter. The first one is the loss of leverage, because of the sequential decline in revenue. We got the foreign exchange, we got as you said, a lower iPhone mix. And we got the Apple Watch. I think we'll leave it at that, and we're not going to get into more specifics. - Luca Maestri (SVP and CFO of Apple) When running the numbers based on management's outlook, I believe that EPS will come in at $1.84 for Q3 2015. I anticipate revenue to come in at the high-end of the range with gross margins of at least 40%. Admittedly, no one believed Apple on the quarterly earnings call when they cited the reasoning behind their lowered gross margin range. So, just to stay on the safe side I modeled 40% gross margin into the next quarter as Apple tends to be extremely conservative on its outlook. Tim Cook mentioned on the earnings conference call that the Apple Watch will have lower gross margins than the consolidated gross margin of Apple in the next quarter. I'm having a hard time believing him. But the reasoning is driven by the initial cost of ramping volume for a new product category. Going forward, there's a lot of operating leverage for the Apple Watch as volume ramp will lower the marginal cost of each additional unit. So, the gross margin for the Apple Watch will most likely improve as various efficiencies paired with utilization of various cost levers will lower the COGS for the infant product category. However, it's not clear what the margin profile is after the comments made by both the CFO and CEO. From the looks of it, Apple Watch gross margins are heavily dependent on the average selling price. My bias is that device buyers will purchase some of the more premium Apple Watch models. So there's definitely room for Apple to surprise investors both in terms of revenue and gross/operating margins. Apple has increased dividends and buyback authorization from $130 billion to $200 billion by the first quarter of Q1 2017. Admittedly, Apple will look into the rate at which they buy back shares at some future point, roughly around this time of year. I anticipate that Apple will accelerate its share buyback program, as its buyback authorization will have to be lifted to utilize the full $200 billion it plans to return to shareholders (cumulatively from 2012 to 2017). I estimate that Apple will buy back $73 billion in shares over the next 24 months. When looking at the above break-down, the above figure balances out to $200 billion (cumulative capital return between 2012-2017). Share buybacks will add momentum to the stock price, which is why I anticipate the cost basis to increase to $156. I also factor in some dilution as a result of share based compensation. Apple reported a stellar quarter. The addition of Apple Watch revenue, paired with the ability to drive operating leverage due to overlapping R&D and SG&A costs, drives my optimism for the duration of the current fiscal year. Admittedly, the iPad is experiencing some cannibalization from the MacBook Air and iPhone 6 Plus, so stabilization and growth might take a while. My guess is that the iPad segment will stabilize at some point in FY 2016. Despite the short-term uncertainty in the tablet segment, there's a lot to look forward to. Therefore, I continue to reiterate my high conviction buy rating on the stock.
