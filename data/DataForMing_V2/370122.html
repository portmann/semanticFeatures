The surprising numbers in Verizon’s AOL buy Verizon’s decision to purchase AOL made headlines, but in the realm of global telecom mergers it is little more than a side note. As this Reuters graphic shows , once debt is factored in, the Verizon acquisition is just the 13th biggest global deal so far this year. A number of the top 10 deals aren’t as much mergers as piecemeal purchases of desirable parts of one company’s business , and it’s unclear whether AOL will be kept intact or disassembled for parts. So far, Verizon hasn’t done much to telegraph its intentions for AOL, though cannibalizing and/or relaunching some of the company’s components seems an option. AOL has discussed spinning off The Huffington Post, which is valued at as much as $1 billion, and manyÂ analysts see AOL’s mobile advertising capabilities as the company’s main asset. AOL’s 2000 merger with Time Warner is generally regarded as a catastrophe, but those who bet on the company when it was subsequently spun back off look have made out pretty well. AOL’s stock closed at $23.50 on its first day back on the market back in 2009â€”that’s less than half of theÂ  $50 per share Â offer that Verizon made this week.
