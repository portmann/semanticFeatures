Is Apple Cheating On The Dividends? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple has been paying a dividend since Q3 2012. The current dividend has fallen a percentage of earnings. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) had banner earnings last quarter, driven by the spectacular success of the new iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. The last line is the one of interest here - Dividends. This is a topic of great interest to investors, not only because it is cash in their pockets, but also because many individuals and mutual funds will purchase stocks based on the dividends. NOTE: Unless noted otherwise, we always refer here to Apple's Fiscal Quarters with fiscal Q1 being the last calendar quarter of the year (Sep. - Dec.). Until recently, Apple last gave a dividend ($0.12) in December of 1995. After that, Apple's fortunes went downhill to the verge of bankruptcy. Steve Jobs took over again in 1996, and never saw fit to give a dividend again. The company was growing fast, and the money was needed to help finance acquisitions and developing production capacity for its suppliers, particularly for new, cutting edge technologies. One example would be the Unibody design for MacBooks. Apple was able to use its reserves to equip production facilities with state of the art milling machines. This gave the company an unbeatable lead in the technology. Eventually however, the cash hoard became so large that any continued savings was indefensible, and in July of 2012, plans were announced for a program of returning capital to stock holders via a stock repurchase plan and dividends. Since then, almost $103 billion has been returned. Since initiation, the dividend has been adjusted twice. The following table gives the per share dividend. But, while the dividends have gone up, the number of shares has gone down due to the buyback, as shown in the following chart (split adjusted). The result is that in spite of growing revenue and profit, since Q2-2014, the total dividend paid each quarter has slipped from the previous quarter. The differential is even more pronounced when you compare the dividend to the earnings. Here we see a more pronounced decline relative to the same quarter the previous year. With record breaking sales, revenue, and earnings this past quarter, dividends as a percentage of earnings is at an all time low, just 15.4%. In the last earnings call, it was noted that the board would take a new look at dividends this quarter. There has been some speculation that any increment from the current $0.47 will be small. I am of the belief that Apple's board members will want to bring it up more or less to parity with earlier levels. So how much will this be? While the last chart above makes a real point, it is a bit simplistic in its assumptions. If you hold dividend amount level for some period of time, then by definition it will change as a percentage of earnings. This is particularly true of Apple for two reasons: Apple sales, and therefore revenues, vary cyclically over the year, and Apple is still growing at a substantial pace. Given #1, it makes more sense to give a ratio of Apple's dividend not to the current EPS but rather to the average of the trailing four quarters EPS. This evens out the first point, and more clearly defines the change in the second. So, first I adjusted all EPS to account for the recent 7-to-1 split, and then for each quarter took the average of it and the previous three quarters EPS to get what I call the Average trailing 4 quarters EPS. This can be seen in the following screen shot which highlights the formula. The boxed value 1.86 is the average of the four values highlighted to its left. If we look at the whole table we can see that the dividend as a percent of this Average trailing four quarters is much more stable than that current EPS. During the first round of dividends (Q3-12 - Q1-13), when the split adjusted dividend was $0.38, this was 24%-25%. Since the first hike to $0.44 (Q2-13), and through the second to $0.47 (Q2-14), this multiple has hovered in the 29% - 31% range - until this past quarter. This holds true as well for the average of the dividend as percentage of the current EPS is also at 31%. This indicates to me, that this is where the board wants to see the value - just under one third of earnings averaged over the ttm. It would seem to me that if one wants to make an educated guess as to what the new dividends will be, this ratio of 31% should be the target. It should be noted that for both the rate hikes, the values were 30% and 28% of the current quarter's (Q2) EPS, which are in the range. Now all one has to do is figure out future earnings. We have two problems here. First is the usual one of ever trying to estimate Apple earnings. The second is the upcoming Apple Watch launch which will raise Apple's earnings going forward, but by what amount is impossible to say. This may also have a substantial effect on the board's willingness to raise the dividend significantly when on the verge of a very risky launch. I will use simple estimates for the current fiscal Q2 earnings. Apple gave projections: Apple is providing the following guidance for its fiscal 2015 second quarter: revenue between $52 billion and $55 billion gross margin between 38.5 percent and 39.5 percent I think that both revenue and gross margin will come in at the high end, perhaps a bit higher. Apple's growth, particularly in China, will show that Cook and Company are once again on the conservative side. So I ran two projections, with revenue of $55 and $60 billion, and margin at 40% leading to a profit margin of 22.4%. This latter figure is the same as the year ago quarter. While Apple's dividend has remained constant over the last four quarters, it value as a percent of earnings has fallen significantly. If Apple wants to keep the earlier ratios, then it will need to raise the dividends. My estimate is that Apple is likely to raise the per share dividend to between 62 and 65 cents per share from the current 47 cents. On the other hand, uncertainty about the upcoming Apple Watch launch might drive this figure down. A figure significantly over 65 cents would indicate great confidence in the viability of this new product. Source: Is Apple Cheating On The Dividends? Disclosure: The author is long AAPL.
