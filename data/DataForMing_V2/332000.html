Amazon Makes New Streaming Show Available Without Prime, With Ads â€“ Consumerist Whoops! It looks like portions of our site are being blocked! Check your browser settings or contact your network administrator. Amazon’s streaming video programming is just another way for the company to entice customers to sign up for Prime memberships, right? Who can resist free 2-day shipping and Alpha House? Yet the company’s new reality show, a fashion design competition called The Fashion Fund, is available to stream for free with ads as long as you have an Amazon account. Oh, and by the way, you can buy the finalists’ collections on Amazon. The Fashion Fund already gave out awards to fresh and talented new designers before it had a reality show, and the show started out on the cable network Ovation. What’s new is that they can potentially reach everyone with an Amazon account, and the intense cross-promotion happening. Amazon gets to attract people who are at least a bit interested in fashion to visit their siteâ€“â€“where they have coincidentally just started to carry their own in-house fashion brands . The Fashion Fund and the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund, meanwhile, get to put the contestants’ products on display on a special site on Amazonâ€“â€“what they refer to as a “a content-rich, dedicated retail experience” on the Amazon Fashion site. As far as we can tell, that means it has some big pictures. They are very nice pictures. You can click over to the clothes from the page where you stream the show, if you want to.
