In a landmark ruling, Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Matthew Cooper is allowing a nurse named Ellanora Baidoo to serve her elusive husband with divorce papers via a Facebook message. Baidoo, 26, â€œis granted permission serve defendant with the divorce summons using a private message through Facebook,â€? with her lawyer messaging Victor Sena Blood-Dzraku through her account, Cooper wrote. While the situation between Ms. Baidoo and Mr. Blood-Dzraku (it is unclear why the bride kept her maiden name, but I have some thoughts) is somewhat unique, the ruling in their case creates a legal situation in which a spouse can serve divorce papers through a social media platform. As of midday, Facebook was up almost a $1.00, which one thinks could be replicated across the social media landscape if we all just sit back and think about the possibilities. We could all get married on Twitter, have weddings on Instagram and probably die on FourSquare (not like anyone would notice these days).
