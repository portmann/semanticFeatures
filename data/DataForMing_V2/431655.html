null June 13 Rating agency Moody's placed software giant Microsoft Corp's AAA credit rating under review for downgrade following the software giant's deal to buy LinkedIn Corp for $26.2 billion. Funding the deal entirely with debt will increase Microsoft's gross debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) ratio, that could pressure its credit rating, Moody's said in a statement on Monday. ( bit.ly/235od7e ) The potential ratings cut on Microsoft will leave Johnson & Johnson and Exxon Mobil Corp as the only U.S. companies retaining triple-A ratings from Moody's. Exxon recently lost its triple-A from Standard & Poor's.
