Netflix Testing Teasers For Its Original Shows, No Plans To Introduce Third-Party Ads â€“ Consumerist After some Netflix subscribers started seeing teaser ads playing either before or after the company’s original programming, the streaming video service has confirmed that yes, it’s testing teasers –only featuring its own shows, before or after its own shows — but no, it won’t be introducing any third-party ads. Cord Cutters News first reported that users were seeing teaser trailers running before and/or after Netflix TV shows in browser viewing, with TechCrunch adding that it’s recently started running pre-roll teaser ads on some devices as well. â€œWeâ€™ve had originals teasers at the end of shows for a while. Some members [are] seeing tests at the beginning of shows. As you know, we test many things over the year, many of which are never universally deployed,â€? a Netflix spokesperson told TechCrunch. This isn’t unlike what you get on say, HBO Go or HBO Now, where subscribers often see spots for upcoming shows or new seasons before the original content starts playing. Showtime If you’re worried about those teaser ads turning into fully-realized commercials from corporate sponsors, rest easy — Netflix says it’s not going to bring in ads from third-party providers. â€œOur policy around ads is unchanged. We have no plans to support third-party ad units,â€? the spokesperson told TechCrunch.
