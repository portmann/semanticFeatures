ETF Hub Aug 20 2015, 19:07 ET | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor How much are Disney and (especially) Comcast's Universal dominating the box office this summer (and, along with that, the year)? Enough that the two studios have combined for 61% of domestic ticket sales since the first Friday in May. With a few weeks left until Labor Day, the summer grosses in North America could come to $4.4B, an all-time record. The two studios have just over 47% of market share for 2015 to date, and seven of the year's top 10 grossing films. Warner Bros. (NYSE: TWX ) is the best of the also-rans, with 14.3% share of the summer box office and 16.7% of 2015. But a relative lack of summer success from Fox ( FOX , FOXA ), Paramount ( VIA , VIAB ), Sony (NYSE: SNE ) and Lionsgate (NYSE: LGF ) presages a tough fall ahead for most. Disney's scores have come with just eight films this year, vs. Universal's 12 and Warner's 17. Paramount had just two films out this summer. Lionsgate's only two summer films are Shaun the Sheep and this weekend's American Ultra, though it can look ahead to the final film in its Hunger Games series due in November. Disney (NYSE: DIS ) is up 6.2% YTD (and was up 29% for 2015 until this month's media meltdown); Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) is up 0.6% YTD (and was up 12% at its late-July high point). Disney's film studio is nowhere successful or dominant as Comcast's Universal Pictures and TWX's Warner Bros. Pictures (the dominant film studio since 2000).Next year it will go bar to form, WB Pictures being No.1, Universal in No.2 and Disney at No.3/4 (Fox have big hits next year).
