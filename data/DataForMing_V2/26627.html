Apple Watch: Understanding Early Sales Data - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Last Friday, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) opened its online store for preorders of the new Apple Watch. This article will clear up some of the misinformation that has resulted from inaccurate reporting. There have been several articles with conflicting headlines with almost all referring to the same resource data, a posting by Slice . The USA Today headline reads Apple Watch first-day pre-orders estimated near 1M, and illustrates the misleading information presented. I am not sure what country the author comes from, but in the U.S., if we are given a count of preorders of a product, we usually expect the number of units sold - not the number of individual sales receipts. Additionally, an unqualified accounting is assumed to be all inclusive, not limited to just one country. Slice Intelligence estimates that 957,000 people in the U.S. pre-ordered an Apple Watch on Friday, the first day the watch was available for sale. According to ereceipt data from a panel of two million online shoppers, each Apple Watch buyer ordered an average of 1.3 watches... [emphasis added] That is to say, Slice estimates that some 1.24 million Apple Watches were preordered in the USA, during the first day. I have written before how it is important to understand where data comes from and how it is gathered. Slice has a particularly solid and large database. It provides a service of tracking your sales receipts for you, keeping them saved and accessible. This means that the data it accesses is reliable for its customers. It also gives it a source of 2 million customers. We get permissioned access to email inboxes from users of our apps (Slice and unroll.me) as well as through partners who license our technology to power their online experiences (i.e. The find, IFTTT, Gone!, etc.). That number [1.2 million] is based on our projections to the online population. Our panel is of 2 million people; 9,080 of whom bought an Apple Watch. Based on our statistical modeling and validation (including partner and client feedback), we are confident our numbers are representative. So, Slice takes the results of a survey of its buyer population, and from that, projects to the U.S. population as a whole. This is what all surveys do. Slice has two advantages: An extremely large sample population (2 million). The fact that the sampling is automatic. Ms. Minney notes that the panel size is "an order of magnitude larger than panels by Nielsen, comScore, etc." Since the data is supplied automatically from real e-receipts, as opposed by any self-reporting, it has a very high degree of accuracy. None of this means that Slice's projection methodology is correct, but it lends credence to the data. Personally, I think that its estimates are most likely quite accurate. It is impossible to avoid some bias whenever taking a sample, but this should be rather small. Slice also notes that the average purchase price was $503.83 per watch, which would have generated about $627 million. The report has further details on the purchase details, plus data for the new MacBook that also went on sale Friday. Preorders for the first day as presented are incomplete since they represent only the USA. While this is clearly stated in the report, many of the news stories were unclear about this, particularly in the headlines. With over 60% of Apple's sales coming from overseas, one expects that this ratio should hold here as well. Of course, there are a couple of things to consider: Preorders were available only in eight other countries, and some have speculated that sales of the gold Edition collection (starting at $10,000) would be particularly high in China. This latter point would strongly skew the average selling price if true. If trying to get a reasonable estimate, we account for #1 but ignore #2, then I think we can estimate between 2 and 2.5 million watches were likely sold worldwide for revenue of between $1 to $1.25 billion. By the time Friday had ended, no Apple Watch models were available for the original date of April 24. All were back ordered at least 2-4 weeks, some until July. Currently (noon PDT, April 13), only a very few SKUs are available in 4-6 weeks, the rest not until June, with a few not until July. Since these dates have not increased tremendously since Saturday morning, we can assume two factors are at work here. First, it is likely there was a flurry of activity at 12:01 AM Friday as early adopters wanted to be first to get the new toys. Once this ended, the pace of orders has slowed down. In particular, I can imagine that a lot of people are figuring that if the watch they want is not available until June, then they are in no hurry to place an order. Second, it should be safe to assume that Apple is still in the process of ramping production, so that production going forward will be better able to meet demand. This means new orders are not driving delays to the same degree as did the original ones. To the investor, this points to a very optimistic view for Apple Watch. The initial launch data is very promising, and the overall concept seems to have been well received. Limited supplies will be keeping it in the hands of early adopters for the time being, and it will still be several weeks before these millions of purchases are out on the streets. Only then will people have a clear idea as to whether it can satisfy a real value proposition or not. As to sales numbers looking forward, there is a huge range of analyst estimates for annual sales of Apple Watches, from 6 million to 38 million units this year. But at least now we have one realistic data point for ASP - $504. At this ASP, revenue calculations are simple. Six million units would be about $3 billion, 30 million units about $15 billion. The latter figure would represent roughly $5 billion incremental income per quarter, adding to an average of $50 billion per quarter [ttm]. This would be a 10% addition.
