Altera Arbitrage Opportunity Still Has Value - Altera Corporation (NASDAQ:ALTR) | Seeking Alpha 14%+ annualized return if the deal closes by April. US regulatory hurdle was easy, EU likely the same. China the only (small) question mark. Risk of deal failure is incredibly small, but could open up some heavy downside on shares. Worth the gamble, if sized appropriately. Merger-arbitrage is something I don't normally dig into too deeply for investment ideas. Such events are a playground for hedge funds and other big money players with far more time, knowledge, and resources than I have. In the markets, I find that retail investors often have much better luck finding alpha in undercovered or underappreciated smaller names rather than chasing returns in high-profile M&A. These deals generally have the risk/reward priced close to in-line when I run the numbers. Every once in a while, however, the market misprices the risk involved in one of these deals, and an opportunity for profit arises. Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) purchase of Altera (NASDAQ: ALTR ) is one of those cases. The agreement was for a purchase price of $54.00/share in cash, valuing Altera at approximately $16.7B. Cautious value investors note that the deal, at 25x ttm EBITDA, is more expensive than comparable deals in the semiconductor space (Avago (NASDAQ: AVGO ) buying Broadcom (NASDAQ: BRCM ), NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ: NXPI ) buying Freescale Semiconductor (NYSE: FSL )). However, Intel still forecasts the deal to be accretive to earnings per share and to close quickly after only six to nine months. I think that the deal is a win/win for both sides. Altera shareholders get a solid premium on shares that have traded below their fair value for some time. Intel gets an immediate foothold to become the number two player in the programmable logic devices (PLD) market, within firing distance of number one player Xilinx (NASDAQ: XLNX ). Xilinx shareholders have been heading for the exit since the deal was announced, with shares down nearly 20% based on fears of what the Intel/Altera union means for their market share. Such fears are justified. The new joint company will likely have significant synergies to allow operational expense reductions (feeding already strong margins), and Intel's leadership/cross-selling will yield significant benefits to improve the already strong Altera product portfolio. Altera's product market is forecast to grow in the mid-high single digits for the next ten years, which could make this an acquisition that contributes $3B in revenue by 2020. This will help Intel move the needle on top-line growth, which has been stagnant (3%) since 2011. One caveat is that only approximately $4B of Intel's current cash pile is available for use in the United States without incurring additional U.S. income tax penalties, so Intel will need to raise significant debt to fund the purchase. This won't be a problem given the hot corporate debt market; deals to raise the cash have already begun. Intel raised $7B late in July. Demand was strong , with significant investor interest helping price the debt favorably. The deal breezed through United States regulatory approval in early September, with the Department of Justice not requesting any additional information. The European Union (ruling by October 14th) and China remain the big obstacles. Intel and Altera do not compete directly with each other, but Intel does provide products to some of Altera's current competitors. This has driven anti-trust worries in the market, likely feeding the disconnect in the current deal spread. I don't expect a review from the European Union, but China may drag its feet. China is currently the world's largest consumer of semiconductor chips and also the location of quite a few foundries, from SMIC to SK Hynix, so regulators there might field some inquiries to take a closer look at the acquisition. However, Intel has been the largest semiconductor supplier to China for several years and has built significant relationships with the Chinese government and regulators. I don't believe that Intel's management would have entered into this deal and set the six to nine month timeframe (and made the comments that they have) without significant assurance that the deal will be successful. With Altera at $50.45/share, about 7% spread remains. Assuming that the deal closes by March 2016 (which is on the high-end of management guidance), you can earn 14% in annual returns with two Altera dividends (going ex-dividend in November/February) as a little extra incentive. The risk here is the premium Intel is paying. If the deal fails, Altera will likely fall dramatically. The current offer of $54.00/share is a significant premium to Altera's prior trading range, which had been range-bound around $35.00/share for the past several years. The chart below illustrates my views on the risk involved in the Altera deal: I think the market currently reflects an 80% chance that the deal will go through at current share price levels, with the chances of closing in January or March split evenly. The 20% risk reflects the possible massive downside of the deal failing, which would likely cause Altera to fall back to $35/share. If you think that this is a fair reflection, then you've got nothing to gain here. However, I think that a 20% chance of failure is rather high at this point. Even just a small change in your perception of that failure drastically changes the potential earnings profile, given my estimates of a 10% chance of deal failure: Given the spread, the Intel/Altera deal presents an opportunity for retail investors to have a high probability win. Other SeekingAlpha contributors like Chris DeMuth, Jr. have been pounding the drum on this opportunity as well , urging retail investors to at least give the potential opportunity a look. I echo those sentiments. This is likely a core position on many big money arbitrage desks given the liquidity involved in the deal, and it is a wonder that the spread has not tightened farther. For investors new to event-driven strategy, this deal will be highly transparent and easy to follow. However, the impact of a negative ruling could have a significant downside, so the size of your position in relation to your overall portfolio should be determined appropriately (2% weight for me, currently).
