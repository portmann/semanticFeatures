Disney: Heads You Win, Tails You Don't Lose - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Disney stock is down 5% after earnings, because the company missed expectations. Once again, obsession over quarterly expectation rules the day. Investors selling Disney based on fears over ESPN are missing the bigger picture -ESPN remains a dominant brand in live sports, which isn't like cable TV in terms of consumption. Investors are also completely ignoring Disney's huge, diversified business, and its multiple future growth catalysts. Now that Disney (NYSE: DIS ) is out with quarterly earnings and the market has reacted with unanimous disappointment, one thing has become clear to me: this market is almost impossible to please. Even a company like Disney, which has one of the most valuable brands in the world, a diversified, hugely profitable business, and multiple catalysts for future growth, can't get it right. Once again, the obsession with hitting quarterly expectations trounces anything else, even the fact that Disney actually grew both revenue and earnings per share on a year-over-year basis. And, it's not like this is a recurring pattern. In fact, it's the first time Disney has missed earnings expectations in five years. While the market panics over ESPN subscriber numbers, it's missing a much broader picture. But the market's foolishness is actually a huge advantage for investors, because this simply amounts to a great buying opportunity. Here's why Disney investors are in such a great spot. On the surface, there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with Disney. Revenue and diluted earnings per share increased 4% and 5% last quarter , respectively. When adjusting for non-recurring charges, such as the $147 million charge in connection with the discontinuation of the Infinity console games business, adjusted EPS rose 11%. That makes 11 consecutive quarters in which Disney grew adjusted EPS by double digits on a percentage basis. Disney generated $2.25 billion of free cash flow last quarter, which was up 12% year over year. Indeed, Disney is a tremendous free cash flow machine. The sell-off is about ESPN, yet again, even though Disney's Media Networks revenue was flat last quarter, and is actually up 4% over the first six months of the fiscal year. Those selling Disney based on what's going on at ESPN are missing a fundamental difference between ESPN and other cable networks that will truly be at risk from streaming and skinny bundles. It's true that many networks stand to lose out if consumers widely adopt skinny bundles, in which they pay lower prices for a smaller group of channels - but ESPN isn't one of those. The reason is because of live sports. Unlike television or movies, which consumers are happy to stream later at their own convenience, sports overwhelmingly must be watched live. Nobody watches Monday Night Football on Tuesday. CEO Bob Iger stated on the first quarter earnings call that last year, 95% of Americans with a multi-channel bundle watched sports, and 81% of those viewers watched ESPN content. This gives ESPN a critical advantage, and it's why I believe even if consumers do gravitate toward skinny bundles, ESPN will still be selected by a great number of them. Besides which, things at ESPN aren't even that bad. Last quarter, ESPN saw higher operating profit, driven by lower costs and higher affiliate revenue. Advertising sales were down slightly, but that was mostly due to the timing shift of six New Year's Eve and New Year's Day College Football Playoff bowl games. These games aired during the first fiscal quarter this year, but aired in the second fiscal quarter last year. Excluding this timing shift, ad revenue was up 3% - hardly reason for panic. And, it's important to note the trend has gotten better to start this quarter; ESPN ad sales are up 5% so far in the current quarter according to Disney . The other key factor investors are missing by overly focusing on ESPN is that Disney is a highly diversified business. It has 11 different properties that each produce at least $1 billion in annual sales. Many of these properties, including its movie studio and theme parks, are poised to generate more than enough growth to offset any future weakness at ESPN. One of the most exciting things I'm looking forward to is the opening of Disney's Shanghai theme park, scheduled for next month. This is a huge opportunity, but it's just one of many in Disney's emerging theme parks and cruise line business. Aside from Shanghai, Disney is on track to open two Star Wars lands in Florida and California, as well as two new cruise ships in 2021 and 2023. Moreover, Disney is in the works to open parks in Hong Kong and Tokyo, so it's clear that the long-term growth trajectory is still well intact. Of course, this doesn't even mention Disney's movie studio, which is quickly becoming a juggernaut in the industry. Sales in that business are up 35% over the first six months, to $4.7 billion. There will be plenty more iterations of Star Wars, along with many more Pixar animated movies, for years to come, along with significant merchandising opportunities as well. Disappointment over whether Disney met expectations is short term in nature. Over the long term, Disney's future is extremely bright. This is a business that every long-term investor should want to own. I made my first purchase of Disney on February 11 at a cost basis of $88.81 per share. I would love it if short-term investors sold Disney down to that level, or even below. The way I see it, Disney epitomizes 'heads I win, tails I don't lose'. As a shareholder, either Disney stock goes up (which is obviously a good thing), or it goes down, and that simply gives me the opportunity to add to my position at a great price.
