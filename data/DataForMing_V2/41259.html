Can GM Sustain Chevy Silverado's Sales Momentum Once Ford F-150's Production Falls In Line? - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Chevy Silverado’s sales have been very impressive in recent times, thanks to rival F-150’s production issues. Silverado’s market share has expanded in the past months at the expense of Ford. General Motors' (NYSE: GM ) Chevrolet Silverado is the automaker's top-selling vehicle . In 2014, the company sold 529,755 units of the Silverado in the U.S., which accounted for 18% of total vehicles sold in the country. The fact that Ford (NYSE: F ) was occupied in retooling its key facilities for the F-150 production in 2014 has been an important factor pushing Silverado's sales. Ford dealers weren't sufficiently stocked with the F-Series, giving Silverado room to grow. Silverado sales volume is up 18% in the first three months of 2015. Ford expects to increase F-150 supply in line with demand by late summer. Can Silverado maintain its momentum going forward? Will it too come up with an aluminum avatar? Let's find out. Chevy Silverado's sales rose 10.3% in 2014 compared with 2013. The year may be bifurcated into two halves. Sales volume declined 1% in the first half of 2014 compared with the same period previous year. But the latter half was extremely impressive with volumes up 21.5% over 2013. There are two reasons to it. First, GM took advantage of Ford's F-Series production issue. The temporary shutdown of Ford's Dearborn and Kansas City plants held up the pickup's production, with an estimated loss of 90,000 units . The shutdown was necessary to reconfigure the manufacturing process for the new aluminum-bodied F-150. Silverado gained massively and it's clearly reflected in sales numbers. Second, after keeping a strong pricing strategy all through, GM made attractive offers to boost truck sales and expand market share before the launch of F-150. As a result, September 2014 sales jumped a stunning 54% to 50,176 units, hitting its best number for the month since 2008 and gaining 6.9% market share. December was another blockbuster month for the pickup with sales surging 36% to 57,837 units. In 2015, the pickup's got off to an encouraging start, registering sales of 126,694 units in the January-March period, an increase of 18%. GM's not offered any incentives in this period. Autoblog took spy shots of the next version of Silverado and believes many of the pick-up's parts such as the hood and front fenders could shift to aluminum. The model is expected to be revealed later this year. GM executives said a move toward aluminum surfaced in 2008 , but the company abandoned the idea owing to cost issues amid market depression. These discussions resurfaced in 2013, but company executives again raised cost concerns and focused on other facelift techniques. But once Ford revealed the aluminum pickup, GM had to take a final call. Early last year, GM entered into a contract with Alcoa (NYSE: AA ) and Novelis for aluminum sheets to be used in next-generation pickups. The demand for aluminum to make automotive bodies is so high that carmakers have to place orders years ahead. All new aluminum-bodied F-150; Source: Ford . Ford's F-150 has received rave reviews and the demand is "outstanding" , says company executive VP Joe Hinrichs. The Blue Oval is ramping up production to keep up with the robust demand. Hinrichs expects sales to be much stronger in the second half of 2015 after fleet production picks up. There's no doubt that Ford's got a great head start, but GM looks prepared too. GM's tie-up for aluminum and autoblog spy shots hint that the automaker's heading toward an aluminum-bodied Silverado. With the all-new F-150, the pickup market is heating up and GM is rebuilding strategies. An aluminum body will also help it adhere to Federal fuel economy standards. The F-150 has shed around 700 pounds that's boosted its fuel economy. When it comes to pickups, the F-Series, Chevy Silverado, and Dodge Ram are the dominant ones in the market. The F-Series has been the top-selling truck for almost four decades now and enjoyed a strong lead of more than 42% over the next bestselling pickup -- the Silverado -- in 2014. However, it should be noted that the Silverado and GMC Sierra together give a close battle to the F-Series, and have even outsold the latter before 2010. * January to March sales; Note: Units sold in the U.S. only; Data from www.goodcarbadcar.net . It's difficult to say whether GM would be able to sustain the Silverado's growth pace once the F-150 rolls out in full force and dealers are properly stocked. Conversely, Ford may also face challenge in regaining the market share it lost during the transition period. It might so happen that buyers that turned to the Silverado would like to continue with it in the future. If Silverado's upgrade later in the year is in aluminum, it would make the pick-up battle even more intense. Results would be crucial as pickups carry high margins and are key profit generators for both GM and Ford. Even a slight change in market share would impact the automakers' bottom lines.
