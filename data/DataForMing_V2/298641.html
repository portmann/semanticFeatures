ETF Hub Jan 22 2016, 18:51 ET | About: Apple Inc. (AAPL) | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor The veteran in charge of the electric-car project at Apple (AAPL +5.3%) is leaving the company for personal reasons, The Wall Street Journal is reporting. Former Ford Motor engineer Steve Zadesky has overseen the project for Apple for the past two years but has told people he's leaving. The move is unrelated to his performance, sources say, and the timing isn't clear. The project -- formerly just rumored, but eventually code-named "Titan" and given a 2019 ship date -- has run into problems, sources said. The company has pressed the team (already up to 600 employees by September) toward ambitious deadlines, though some on the team felt the targets weren't attainable. office politics, because the intimidating dragon is gone... so maybe also that is why Apple in products are drifting ... AWatch!! Unless there is specific reason to be skeptical, until proven otherwise, I give these things the benefit of the doubt. The anomaly would be if nobody ever left for personal reasons. Life happens outside of work... just in case some forgot. On another note, 2019 seems too ambitious to me too. Concept and design yes, test maybe, but to bring to mkt? Cwazy Wabbits at Apple. Sounds like Apple's "ship date" means the engineers sign off by then, but then there could be a lot longer actually bringing it to market ... a bit bigger than a watch. ambitious deadlines because they know they are already late to the game, compared to regular automakers, Tesla and even Google. the head of what could be a transformational product leaves before the product is complete.  This smells of serious problems.  Could be Apple or could be that he wasnt capable.  Who knows. toneguru, I don't think 2019 is too ambitious. He still has 3 years down the road. And, there are ways to build a project within 10 years and a different way to build it within 2 years. Argument about expectation and timeline is ridiculous. If he is a top engineer in Ford Motors, he can quickly scope it and fit into the timeline. Even though it delays to 2020, Apple will still accept it in the end. I rather support the company to have more schedule/time flexibilities to their employees than to beat deadlines because producing quality products are essential.  Remember - haste makes waste. Could be for "personal reasons" but on a project like this, it seems a bit ominous. I'm excited about Apple's prospect for a car, especially since Mark Hibbins' article which, if correct, means Apple could end up dominating the electric car market.  This departure of top-level project management is worrisome. While sometimes it is instructive to read comments - sometimes like this time it makes you wonder if some of people on here are brainless  ? Hahaha.. The very same analyst that announced how undervalued Apple's stock has gotten today, are the same analyst that went-on-and-on about how much Apple was going to make selling cars!!!  It's the BIG SCREEN TELEVISION all over again! Good news though, ONE product is still working, sort of:(  Unfortunately, the biggest disaster is yet to come, the iPhone 7 -  Unfortunately, I understand there's nothing really big or new about that product, either. But Apple's marketing department is sure to get some exciting swirling by launch. I don't keep up to date on such things; do we (the lowlife public) know anything about the iphone 7? From your tone I suspect you won't be helpful so asking at large. Hahaha..

But Apple's marketing department is sure to get some exciting swirling by launch. Sane man, insane project. No auto manufacturer has any sustainable moat ever. No one ever died in an iPhone accident. Hard words but I'm inclined to agree. Putting a car on the market is not to be taken lightly, it's not a harmless gadget. Regulations and responsibilty they have not been close to yet. As a long I sure hope they know what they're doing. Shares of Aapl have been struggling to cling to $110 p/shr since last quarter and share price continues trending downward until they rallied up 5% today.   I thought investors finds value in this company before next Tuesday's ER. All of a sudden, you hear the leader who in charge of the electric car is leaving the company for good.  will this unexpected news send the stock spiral down again?  It has been already a roller coaster ride for investors? Now this could change Apple's destiny, either become a conglomerate or become the next IBM.I hope they actually buy TWX (not fully but like 70%-what Jeff Bewkes may also want) and then go for Fitbit and Spotify afterwards. If they buy Fitbit or Spotify the stock will go down immediately. TWX has HBO which is a gem but I don't think AAPL wants to run a cable company these days. Not really a fan of any of these suggestions. I'd go SQ or PYPL or even a TRIP if they're feeling aggressive. Peer to peer payments or information as power is the direction I'd like to see them go. Cars are for Ford. High ticket price and tiny margins don't interest me at all. Conglomerates are repeat offenders at stagnating into obsolesces. They become too cautious on new technology, too large to sustain effective communication, and too secure in their empire. Prominent examples being the Asian Tiger conglomerates. What if his services were no longer need due to Apple buying TSLA and with it, TSLA's human capital?  The point is nobody knows why he left. Elon's vote is needed to sell tesla. He is much closer with Larry Page and turned down repeated offers from google. Tesla's stated goal is "to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable transport." Apple's stated goal is to make as much profit as they can. Different cultures. No one in the world can match Steve Jobs.  Not in Apple.  Not in Google.  Google Glass is a gimmick.  Google self-driving car is a gimmick too. I'm thinking he left cause oil is so cheap and everyone is gonna be buying F-150s for the next 4 years. This Titan Project, i Car, or whatever the Hell somebody wants to call it Today should never have happened. All Cook had to do was take his overseas money and buy BMW in Germany. What a waste of time, energy, and Company (Shareholder Money). And that is "assuming" any of this car crap is even true, because Apple and Cook won't tell You "Jack Shi*" unless You are The Pope, a Politician (European or Chinese lately) or a Social Reformer! You think a guy that worked his live at a US car company can handle the culture and pace of a tech company.. Do you think as a rule the executives of the old school companies like IBM/GE etc. would be fit in easily at the new tech movers? Business history / technology is littered with attempts, but old dogs can't be taught new tricks.  We continue to believe extremely talented zebra's can change their stripes and adapt to new cultures and stuff.  That is indeed a rare animal that can do that.   Not saying one shouldn't bring in senior talent, but senior talent at most companies got their not buy being very different than that companies norm, why would you expect great success taking that talent out to another company with radically different norms... The Apple bears will feast or try to feast, but nobody outside has a friggen clue at what is really going on inside, nor can anyone predict what the next  big thing will be. Here's a real simple solution. Apple buys Tesla. Five AAPL for One TSLA sounds about right. Musk runs the e-car division. Done and done. :) Musk has publicly said he does not want to sell Tesla. Musk has privately turned down offers from Larry Page whom he is close friends with. Tesla and Apple have very different cultures. Tesla is outrageously expensive. I'd rather see them take a chunk of the gigafactory to produce a battery that can last longer than 6 hours! IMO, Apple does not want to buy Tesla. Mr. Musk will not sell Tesla. However, the two companies could cooperate and form an interesting partnership, with significant benefits to both corporations. Curious how this story was released literally days before one of the most Crucial Earnings Reports in Apple's history. Go figure? Tim Cook does attract much APPLE Fans like it used to be when the company is under Steve Job.  Everyone is giving him failing score "D-". To rescue this sinking ship = to change CEO? Seems much more likely they're developing an add-on for existing vehicles to make them "Apple friendly". Doing that would require a lot of work on Apple's side because Ford, for example, isn't going to want to do all the work and give Apple all the profit. Apple needs to be right there hand-in-hand in the design phases for every model car they want to partner with and that's why they need so many people, industry experts, etc. If they actually do try to unveil a "finished road ready" iCar that would be quite a shock to me. I wouldn't see the appeal...Tesla is already doing that and it's a profit-free business.
