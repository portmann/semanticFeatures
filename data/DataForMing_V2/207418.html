Intel Should Worry A Lot If Apple Excludes It From Future Macs - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha There was a recent article claiming Intel shouldn't be worried if Apple starts using its own processors in its Mac line. The reasons for Intel needing to worry are numerous and such a move by AAPL could actually be catastrophic for INTC. What prompted me to write this was Alpha Max's article, Intel Shouldn't Worry If Apple Excludes It From Future Macs , where he argues that even if Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) decides to switch some of its Macs to its own CPUs, that wouldn't be much trouble for Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ). Alpha Max also argues that it wouldn't be much trouble because Intel could get a chance to go inside Apple's 2016 iPhones and next-generation iPads. I don't agree. Intel should be worried if this - Apple switching some Macs to its own CPUs - ever happens. Indeed, it should be very worried about the chance of it ever happening. And this is so for several reasons. Let me explain. The case for Apple switching is easy. Buying CPUs from Intel is wildly more expensive than using its own CPUs/SoCs. While the typical Intel laptop CPU can cost hundreds of dollars, the typical house-sourced, foundry-produced, ARM-licensed SoC will cost around a couple of dozen dollars. 70-80% savings on the CPU front wouldn't be impossible if Apple could make the change. So the incentive exists and is large. Furthermore, shifting all its lines (mobile, laptops, desktops) to ARM Holdings' (NASDAQ: ARMH ) ARM architecture would present a couple of other significant advantages, including: Controlling a chief differentiator in its hardware, as it now does within the mobile space. Building its own SoCs allows Apple to keep an advantage over competitors which these (except possibly for Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF )) haven't been able to close yet. Losing the ability to run Windows on the same machines, which might still ease the transition for some Windows users. And losing backwards compatibility, which Apple could easily remove in its own software, but which would still be present for third-party applications. However, all of this is held back by the fact that such a switch would need to at least match the performance of the present Intel CPUs. In this regard, it's significant that Apple is already claiming the ability of its A9X Apple SoC to compare favorably with some of Intel's mobile CPUs. This is even more relevant because the A9X isn't yet a part that's optimized for the laptop/desktop environment, which would still lend it further performance. Anyway, the main stumbling block for Apple would be this: performance. And in the plus department you'd find many reasons, cost and thus product margins being the main one. Still if Apple were to switch, Intel would see an immediate loss of a large customer, now representing nearly 15% of the entire PC market. This would already be a reason for Intel to worry. Were Apple to switch to its own CPUs, several things would happen, all of which would affect Intel: Other laptop/desktop competitors would instantly pressure Intel for lower-priced parts to be able to compete with Apple's newfound lower-cost competitiveness. Since Apple does not hold a lock on the abilities of the ARM platform, other manufacturers would develop the underlying ARM tech (along with ARM itself) to provide similar levels of performance. Indeed, a seed of this can already be seen in AMD's (NASDAQ: AMD ) and Qualcomm's (NASDAQ: QCOM ) efforts. And right afterwards, they, too, would drop Intel to adopt these new and much cheaper SoCs in their products. Since the previous dynamic would be evident, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) would quickly be forced to issue full Windows versions for that new hardware. All in all, Intel would initially see margin pressure from the pricing pressure, to be followed by volume and margin pressure from a large migration toward ARM-powered laptops and desktops. The migration would happen even if Intel yielded to the initial pricing pressure, simply because the cost differentials are so large Intel could never cover them through pricing concessions. In short, Apple moving to its own ARM-based CPU designs could well spell catastrophe for INTC, due to the dynamics it would set in motion. This risk didn't exist previously when Apple used PowerPC and Motorola CPUs simply because those were not 80% cheaper the way ARM designs are today. Regarding Intel being inside the iPhones and iPads, that just seems to be some sort of confusion. The A9 is not "made" by Samsung or TSMC (NYSE: TSM ). They just produce it, they're contract foundries, a sort of higher-tech contract manufacturer. But the design is Apple's, and those SoCs are as much Apple's as AMD's CPUs are AMD's no matter if they're produced by GlobalFoundries or TSMC (or Samsung, or Intel). In this case, if Intel got any work from Apple, it would be "simple" foundry work, which would give it a fraction of the sales and margins that it would lose if Apple were to migrate its Macs to its own SoCs. This article does not mean I think such a migration away from Intel is about to happen over at Apple. I don't think such is imminent. But to say Intel shouldn't be worried about it is, in my view, entirely wrong. Intel does need to be worried about it. Not just because of what Apple represents to Intel in terms of direct sales, but also due to the pricing pressure and possible stampede such a move could incite in the rest of the tech world. PC laptop and desktop makers cannot afford to compete with Apple if it gets access to CPUs that are potentially 80% cheaper, so they'd be also forced to migrate if AAPL ever did such a thing itself.
