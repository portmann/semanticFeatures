Apple Is Winning The Smartphone Upgrade Race In China - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Gartner Research has reported smart phone market share data for Q2, including important data for China. Gartner's China data confirms continued robust growth for iPhone in unit sales and market share. The fact that this growth occurred despite contraction in the overall smart phone market in China bodes well for the September quarter. The China market data indicates that the new bear thesis that China would be the downfall of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is not supported by the facts. Instead, China will continue to fuel iPhone sales growth. Gartner's data suggests that it is the Android ecosystem that will see a slowdown. Gartner Research usually releases their smartphone market share data about a month after IDC. Usually the research companies are in close agreement, so Gartner's announcements tend to be a little anticlimactic. However, Gartner's announcement of their 2015 Q2 smartphone data contained some golden nuggets of information. First and foremost was an estimate of unit sales to end users in China of iPhone of 11.9 million units, for 68% y/y growth. Gartner's number for y/y growth is a little different from Apple's figure of 87% announced during the calendar Q2 conference call , because Gartner is counting sales to end users only (sell through), while Apple includes sales into distributor channels along with their own retail sales (kind of sell in plus sell through). Apple's results were all the more impressive for the fact that Gartner reports that the overall smartphone market in China declined 4% y/y in Q2. The market is saturated, but it is saturated with older less capable 3G phones. As China converts to 4G, upgrades become the important market segment. As Gartner's Anshul Gupta states: China has reached saturation - its phone market is essentially driven by replacement, with fewer first-time buyers. Beyond the lower-end phone segment, the appeal of premium smartphones will be key for vendors to attract upgrades and to maintain or grow their market share in China. Apple's positioning in China as the aspirational brand of choice for smart phone buyers is working very well for it. Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) has clearly fallen out of favor in China as a premium brand. Overall, Gartner confirms that Samsung lost 4.2 percentage points of market share globally, and saw its unit shipments decline by 5.4% y/y. Perhaps even more significant than the China data, Gartner also provides a breakdown by overall operating system. Android is still the overwhelming choice worldwide, with an 82.2% market share, but that share actually declined y/y by 1.6%, while Apple's share rose by 2.4%. Meanwhile, all other operating systems including Windows Phone and Blackberry (NASDAQ: BBRY ) declined. And what of the supposed downturn in the Chinese economy that was supposed to follow the collapse of the Chinese stock market bubble in July? There's no sign of it yet. According to The Economist , China's GDP grew at a robust 7.1% y/y in Q2, rebounding from a 5.8% growth in Q1. More importantly, The Economist considers this number credible. The Economist points out that much of this growth came from the services sector, which grew 8.4%, and especially from financial services, but the industrial sector also grew at 6.1%. Although financial services will probably take a hit in Q3, the overall Chinese economy is not teetering on the brink of collapse. If there is a Paper Tiger here, it's the bear case about Apple that emerged after the China market collapse: Apple's growth has been fueled by China, but now Apple had become too dependent on China. A downturn in China would curtail Apple's growth, so the bears argued. It was a plausible argument, but not a data driven one. I've argued (in Apple's Next iPhone: A Bellwether for Growth Momentum ) that Apple's earnings guidance contained a worst case scenario for China of zero growth y/y for the September quarter. With a new iPhone being introduced in September, along with probably a new Apple TV, the guidance seemed very conservative. Way too conservative. Apple isn't going to see zero growth in China. Growth may slow down, but it's likely to be at least 20% year over year, probably more. The midpoint of Apple's guidance as of the June earnings report was $50 billion in revenue for a 19% y/y increase. With reasonable growth in China, Apple blows way past this. How much in excess of Apple's guidance will be the subject of future articles as we get closer to the end of the quarter, and as we get to see exactly what Apple's new products look like.
