Are Strong Dollar Fears Overblown For Apple? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha A strengthening US dollar will have no significant impact on the returns on Apple stock. For US based exporters, a strengthening dollar has the effect of reducing the US dollar value of foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings unless the firm hedges its foreign exchange exposure effectively. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) does hedge effectively. For shareholders, this means that there is no indirect exposure to exchange risk. In other words, the informed investor who is aware of the risks to Apple's future cash flows can rest assured that a strengthening dollar should not threaten returns. We expect that the impact on shareholder returns due to a strengthening dollar will be minimal. To see why this is true, we first review Apple's sophisticated hedging strategies before moving to a quantitative study determining the sensitivity of share returns to a US dollar index. Apple is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S dollar. A strengthening dollar will negatively impact foreign currency denominated revenue. As stated in annual and quarterly reports, such a scenario generally causes AAPL to increase its international pricing to compensate for lost revenue and to maintain strong margins. This may lead to a decrease in demand for its products as consumers switch to lower cost alternatives or postpone upgrades. Alternatively, should Apple choose not to raise prices, foreign revenue figures reported in dollars will suffer. Overview of Pricing and Hedging Policies: As foreign currencies weaken versus the dollar, Apple will increase its international pricing to compensate for the lost revenue. In Q1 2015, Apple raised its prices on both its devices and services in Canada, Europe, Australia and Japan in response to the strengthening US dollar. The price hikes have little impact on the demand for iPhones, which represent 69% of Q1 revenue and continue to grow around the world as demand continues to outpace supply. Apple also hedges a portion of its FX exposure for a period of up to 12 months. As of March 28th 2015, Apple had foreign exchange derivative contracts amounting to a notional value of $63.341 billion . This is in contrast to foreign non-Chinese revenue for the previous six-month period totaling $47.760 billion (36% of total revenue). This figure excludes revenue from Greater China since the Yuan is a managed floating exchange rate trading in a tight band versus the dollar. To test whether Apple's shares had any sensitivity to the strength of the US dollar, we considered 10 years of weekly returns. We used closing prices for 536 weeks starting on April 1, 2005, and ending on July 3, 2015. Apple shares were normalized for dividends, stock splits and other events. We analyzed the logarithmic returns of Apple's shares over a 10-year period. We did not omit any data, thus any fluctuations in returns included both market expectations and surprises. Apple is a global company. Its earnings and expenses originate from many geographic regions with widely varying currencies. As a measure of the US dollar's strength, we used Bloomberg's BBDXY index which tracks the US dollar versus a basket of 10 leading global currencies. We used the following model to explain the returns on Apple shares: Here aaplt, spxt , and bbdxyt are the log-returns on AAPL, the S&P 500 and the USD index, respectively. Since the VIX corresponds to the implied volatility of the S&P 500, of which Apple is a member, we used its levels to compute the implied variance of the S&P 500 to help explain the variance of AAPL. For consistency, we calculated the logarithmic differences of the S&P 500's implied variance over the period. The logarithmic changes in the S&P 500's variance are represented by vixt. The AR(3) and MA(3) are third-order autoregressive and moving average processes. So does the US dollar's strength affect AAPL returns? No. We performed a likelihood ratio test for an alternative model to that of the above equation where we omitted the returns on the US dollar index. As the figure below shows, it is extremely unlikely that the US dollar index returns explain AAPL returns (p>0.8). Since a model for AAPL returns with and without the inclusion of US dollar index returns are statistically indistinguishable, we must conclude that AAPL returns are not explained by the strength of the US dollar. Some readers might object to the quantitative analysis we performed so we feel it is best to address these concerns immediately. Some will claim that Apple's latest quarterly report had some nasty surprises. Fundamentalists will look at this 10-Q, form an opinion on the future of Apple's profitability, and act upon it. We don't disagree with this approach. In fact, we rely on the efficiency of the market - of investors acting on all known public information. To eliminate shocks to returns stemming from the market correcting its valuation of Apple after the release of new information, we considered weekly returns. Of course, we assumed that informed investors act within a week of new information coming out. This had the effect of smoothing out the shocks due to large intraday and intraweek moves in share price. What remains was the longer-term returns that were driven by the economic fundamentals - strong earnings, the macroeconomic environment and overall market performance. But what of Apple's changing product line? What of the changing competitive landscape? To this we answer that the astute reader will have noticed that our analysis of returns began in 2005. Two thousand five! Apple had just partnered up to produce the "World's First Mobile Phone with iTunes." The ROKR would enable "music lovers to transfer up to 100 [!] of their favourite songs" to their $250 (with a two-year contract) phone. Since then, Apple's products have changed radically, consumer preferences also changed, and the world before then is nearly incomprehensible to today's kids. Others could say that Apple's incredible growth over the last 10 years overpowers any impact that currency exchanges could have had. While the growth of the company is undeniable, Apple's international exposure has remained rather constant over this period. Therefore, we can assume that its exposure to foreign exchange risk also has remained rather constant. This has likely honed the skills of Apple's risk managers which is reflected in their successful approach at insulating its profitability from the uncertainty of exchange rates. The lack of sensitivity to the US dollar's strength over ten years points to Apple's ability to effectively insulate itself from currency exchange fluctuations despite its global exposure. We must assume that its pricing as well as its exchange hedging policy are effective in protecting shareholders from unforeseen exposure to currency risk.
