Why Amazon's Dash Button Will Flop - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Similar to past instances, I predict the Dash button will flop. This is similar to my predictions on the Fire Phone and the diapers. As you all know, I am in the business of predicting Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ) products will flop. I did it with the Fire Phone . Then I did it with the diapers . And now I'm doing the same with the Dash button . As is well known, the Fire Phone flopped. It started being sold for as much as $649 unlocked, and ended its short and tragic career being sold as low as $100 to get rid of the inventory . As for the diapers, they flopped in a similar manner and were simply withdrawn from the market . Both of these products flopped for rather similar reasons, chief amongst them the inadequate pricing. In short, Amazon.com built a story around each of the products (gimmicks not available elsewhere for the Fire Phone, ethical diapers for the diapers) and then tried pricing them for a profit. But thing is, consumers are not about to buy Amazon.com-branded products priced for a profit (except for the Kindle eReaders). They're there for the bargains and they've stated this often already . Now I am saying that the Dash button will fail for a rather similar reason (along with others that are not so relevant). The main reason is: Consumers are not going to press a button and order goods from Amazon.com "sight" (and price) unseen. They won't do it because Amazon.com is well known to change prices often and promote stuff often. Those following Amazon.com's best sellers' list know that items, which are on promotion, see tremendous increases in sales. Amazon.com's customer is not suddenly going to lose its price sensitiveness and just press a button mindlessly to order stuff no matter what the price. In short, consumers are not going to risk being taken to the cleaners by Amazon.com, the same Amazon.com that's been trying often to price for profits. Other (less relevant) reasons will be: If consumers want to order from Amazon.com they can already do so conveniently in their mobile phones. The Dash button will require Wi-Fi, so wherever it works the mobile phone will also work even without consuming data and while delivering much more information regarding the purchase. Furthermore, to placate the customer's fears about price, Amazon.com will give them some time to change their orders. But then again that's the same as customers using the mobile instead since using the mobile saves them one step (the confirmation/cancellation of the order after checking prices). There are a couple of positive things to say about the Dash button as well. Or rather, less negative things. Here they go: The button will fail in a very discreet way. Way more discreet than the Fire Phone or even the diaper flops. We'll never know how many were placed, or how much they were used.* The button looks very cheap so the failure will also cost much less than either the Fire Phone or the diapers (which were themselves already a cheaper failure than the Fire Phone). Indeed, the button was really built to be cheap - it doesn't even include a small display, which would cut out half of the fear of buying "price-unseen" just by displaying the price and a few more details. In short, this will be a cheap and discreet failure. But it does highlight something, which I already talked about regarding the previous two failures: This move is an attempt by Amazon.com to sell products at profit-enabling prices. In this regard, it's similar to the Fire Phone and the diapers. The intent here is to sell goods at full price (and thus earning a profit). Unfortunately, it will fail. In this case, it will fail not because the prices are necessarily too high, but because the customers will fear them to be. The Dash button will fail because customers won't want to buy products without knowing the price they'll be paying, and they won't want the hassles of having to check prices after they bought, either. The main conclusion from the coming Dash button failure is simply that nearly every attempt by Amazon.com to price for profits fails. Thus, profits are and will remain an illusion. * Well, perhaps in the first year, we'll hear about how orders through the Dash button were "a record" (compared to zero in the past). In the second, we'll hear about "100% or more growth from 2015" (since it was just starting out in 2015). In the third, we're sure to see no mention.
