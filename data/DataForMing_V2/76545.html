ETF Hub Jun  4 2015, 09:51 ET | About: Apple Inc. (AAPL) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor Starting in two weeks, some Apple Watch ( AAPL -0.1%) models will be available for sale at retail Apple Stores; Watch sales have been online-only to date. By June 26, the Watch will also be available in 7 more countries - Italy, Mexico, Singapore, Spain, South Korea, Taiwan, and Switzerland - and at "select Apple Authorized resellers." It originally launched in the U.S., China, Hong Kong Japan, the U.K., France, Germany, and Canada. Operations SVP Jeff Williams: "The response to Apple Watch has surpassed our expectations in every way ... We're also making great progress with the backlog of Apple Watch orders ... All orders placed through May, with the sole exception of Apple Watch 42 mm Space Black Stainless Steel with Space Black Link Bracelet, will ship to customers within two weeks." Many initial Watch buyers saw lengthy shipping times. The WSJ reported in April a component defect at one of two taptic engine suppliers hurt availability, and suggested production could improve in June as taptic supplier Nidec (the one not seeing the defect) ramps production. Apple still hasn't provided formal sales figures for the Watch. Research firm Slice has estimated U.S. sales totaled nearly 2.5M through May 18. Great! Another moneymaker for Apple. It's another piece of the brilliant infrastructure Apple is building. Big surprise, all the blabbermouths so ready to soot an new idea from Apple down before it is released are wrong...AGAIN.
