Ford: Trying To Be Big In This Growth Market - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford is a small player in India, which is not good news, as auto sales in this market are expected to double by 2020. Ford, however, has been mildly successful in increasing market share in India of late on the back of new product launches, and is trying to sustain this momentum. Ford is looking to make spare parts cheaper, introduce more sub-parts, and increase affordability of spares in order to further increase sales in India. In a recent article on Ford (NYSE: F ), I had focused on how the company's focus on the SUV segment in two of the fastest-growing automotive markets in the world will allow it to improve its margin performance in the long run. In fact, Ford's Asia Pacific president, Dave Schoch, believes 60% of Ford's growth in the next decade will come from Asia Pacific. Now, India will be one of the most important cogs for Ford in the Asia Pacific as auto sales in this country are expected to double to 6 million units by the end of the decade as compared to 2013. However, Ford is still a minor player in India with just 2.6% market share and sold just 81,570 units in India last year, thereby clocking a monthly run rate of less than 6,800 units. As compared to the millions of vehicles that Ford sold across the globe last year, this is a very small number. However, while this represents a challenge for Ford since it has low market share, it also gives the company an opportunity to make the most of the prospects that the Indian market will offer in the long run. Let's see if the company is doing enough to tap the opportunity. Ford India has been performing well this year. In February, it sold 17,306 units , up 37.61% from 12,576 units sold last year. The growth in sales was driven by exports which have been the focus of auto majors in India in the recent past. Global auto majors like Ford, GM (NYSE: GM ) and Volkswagen ( OTCPK:VLKAY ) are investing heavily in the country. However, these carmakers aren't up to the mark in the Indian market so they are focusing more on exports. For instance, Ford's domestic sales have been flat at best this year. In fact, Ford saw a decline of 8% in domestic sales in the month of February in India. The Blue Oval sold 5,483 units last month in India compared to 5,959 units last year. The domestic market share of Ford has been moving within the 2% to 4% range all through this fiscal year. Ford still remains in the bottom rungs of the Indian car industry with an average market share of 3.3%. On the other hand, on the export front, Ford's sales nearly doubled from 6,617 units in February 2015 to 11,823 units in February 2016. However, other companies are targeting growth of 20% to 60% for their Indian operations in terms of production due to their multi-billion-dollar investments. This clearly indicates companies are planning to make India a manufacturing hub, which will cater to other, more vibrant markets in "the neighborhood" and even the far West. The following chart shows the growth in Ford's exports: A key reason why Ford lies in the lower rungs of the line-up of car makers in the Indian market is because of stiff competition. The Indian car market has been long ruled by the Japanese Maruti Suzuki, which commands a near 50% of the market share with its affordable and high mileage offerings which the Indian customers love. Following Maruti are other Asian brands like Hyundai, M&M, Honda, Tata, and Toyota, which have a much longer and successful experience of selling cars in India as compared to Ford who once had to shut shop earlier due to heavy losses. Ford re-entered the Indian market in 1995 but this second innings hasn't been very successful so far. However, as seen in the first chart given in the article, Ford has been able to improve its market share of late in India, and the company will try to sustain the momentum by investing in its models. Let's see how. Ford hasn't left hopes yet about doing well in India. The U.S.-based car maker is bringing in major changes in its sales & marketing strategy for India as it looks to change itself into a big player in this market. Ford has identified certain key areas that need to be addressed in order to increase its sales and maintain customer loyalty. The first area is product-led innovation. As a part of this plan, Ford's new models for the Indian market have been equipped with new features in order to make its vehicles more attractive to buyers. For instance, Ford has equipped the Figo Aspire with cruise control and also deployed semi-assisted self-parking in the Endeavour, which are segment-first features in India. Another area to be addressed as identified by Ford India is the cost of spare parts, components, and maintenance. Ford is still perceived to be expensive to maintain in India, and the Indian customer likes cheap maintenance a lot. As a result, Ford has improved the maintaining ability of its new models by increasing the number of sub-assembly parts from around 200 for the Figo hatchback in 2010 to 800 for the new Figo and Aspire models. This will allow customers to replace only the required part in case of damage and not the entire unit. Moreover, Ford has worked on component price reduction as well by increasing the percentage of locally-sourced parts, apart from enhancing the distribution channel for spare parts and components. This has been achieved by allowing non-dealer workshops to sell genuine accessories and also amplifying the number of service centers closer to customers. Ford has tried to increase its market share in India by introducing 4 new cars recently, and the results are showing as its market share has ticked up slightly. Additionally, the company's focus on improving the service and maintenance experience is also going to work in its favor going forward. So, in my opinion, Ford can step on the gas in the Indian market gradually and add to its overall growth considering the opportunity present here.
