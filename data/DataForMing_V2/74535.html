Disney unveils high-tech, active-play Playmation toys - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Jun  2 2015, 16:58 ET | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Disney's (NYSE: DIS ) latest line of toys marks a change from the status quo, as the company has designed them in-house rather than merely licensing out its media properties. The activity-oriented Playmation line features a package of high-tech wearables (and is initially centered on Marvel's Avengers, including an Iron Man glove). They're not Uncle Walt's playsets, though, using infrared, Bluetooth and motion sensors to operate together, with those from other children as well as action figures which will interact with the wearables. A companion app offers extra "missions," but no screens are required for play. The sets are up for pre-order in July and go on sale in October starting at $120. "Hulk Hands" will follow in November. Annual sales are being projected at $500M just from the Avengers-themed line, and surpassing $1B as it's expanded to Disney's other brands (get ready for Star Wars and Frozen Playmation toys coming over the next two years).
