Ford: Earnings Commentary Supports Our Bull Case, Domestic Growth Holding Up - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Slow and steady wins the race. That's our investment theory when it comes to our Ford position. Domestic reception of the F-150 and future profitability from other global markets continues to validate our long case. Slow and steady wins the race. That's our investment theory when it comes to our Ford (NYSE: F ) position. Sure, Ford may be stuck in a trading range that it hasn't deviated from over the last 5 years, but important things have been going on under the surface while this is happening. The company is paying a dividend with a great yield. The company continues to invest in its global operations in anticipation of having them become new profit centers. The purpose of this article is two-fold. First, we want to identify some new domestic auto sales data that continues to be in line with expectations. Second, we want to review some key points of Ford's conference call this past week, and point out how they continue to coincide with our bull thesis. First, the company's April sales were released today, May 1st. The company's unit sales were up 5.4% to 222,498 versus 6% estimates. The specifics were Much of our thesis on Ford so far has been reliant on the expected success of the company's new F-150 model. We also learned on May 1st that Ford "posted a strong +60K number for the F-Series in April even with a Kansas City assembly plant not yet fully up to capacity." Secondly, let's take a look at some of the statements made on the company's recent conference call, post earnings. Here's some of the bullish commentary from Ford's conference call, and our corresponding analysis. "As you can see here, our plan for profitable growth and of course our focus as a business continue to deliver and they remain unchanged." This general commentary reiterates our outlook that the company believes things to be on course, as we do. "And while wholesales were about unchanged due to major product launches and the revenue was down mainly because of the effect of the stronger U.S. dollar on our international operations, we grew our global market share and achieved profitability in four of our six business units." This comment reiterates our thesis that ongoing international growth continues, and that the company's revenue miss was due to the strength of the dollar, as many other larger multinational companies have faced this earnings season. "...we delivered in the first quarter, from several new Ford and Lincoln products and new plants and facilities to being named the only automaker on the list of the World's Most Ethical Companies and growing our dividend, we are very pleased with our progress." We like Ford as a company because its brand doesn't face the stigma that General Motors (NYSE: GM ) does. This continues to infuse integrity into its brand and coincides with our outlook that Ford will turn around Lincoln (especially internationally). "We also have more capacity coming online in Asia-Pacific in the second half that will drive incremental volume and revenue. We also expect improvements to the bottom line, specifically higher automotive operating margin and strong growth in automotive pre-tax profit driven by North America and Asia-Pacific with improved results in Europe and South America as well. We continue to expect most of the company improvement to occur in the second half." The above statements coincide with our thoughts that China and Asia specifically are going to be major growth drivers for the company in the next couple of years. Ford's investments in these areas, we believe, are eventually going to help drive the bottom line once capex settles down and Ford can achieve some operating leverage. "We expect North America to have a very strong year in 2015 with substantial top line growth, higher pre-tax profit and an improved operating margin. This is based on continued robust industry sales, our strong product lineup, including products launched last year and planned for this year, our continued discipline in matching production with demand and a lean cost structure." The above statement basically coincides with the backbone of our outlook, that domestic growth will hold up and continue to support international expansion. Here's some additional support for our outlook that the company's international expansion is going to be the profit driver (and subsequently the shareholder value creator moving forward): "We confirmed earlier this month our commitment to the Russian market, where we agreed to certain changes with our partner, Sollers that will allow both parties to continue to support the Ford Sollers joint venture in the near-term, while providing a platform for future growth in this very important market. As a result of these changes, we consolidated our Russian operations as of March 31. We are continuing our strategy in this region to invest for growth in incremental capacity, new products and of course Lincoln in China. We expect Asia Pacific to have a strong year with the top and bottom line results improving substantially in the second half versus the first half due to added capacity and new products to be launched from the middle of the year, notably the three row Edge, the all-new Taurus, Figo, the all-new Everest, the refreshed Ranger and the all-new Lincoln MKX. As shown on the left, our first quarter wholesale volume was up 5% compared with a year ago, while our net revenue which excludes our China JVs declined 14%. Our China wholesale volume, which isn't shown, was up 10% in the quarter. This reflects in part strong market reception to the all-new Escort, as well as Lincoln, which is off to an encouraging start with several of our China dealers already among the brand's highest volume dealers globally." While the market didn't seem to especially enjoy Ford's last earnings report, it fell in line with what we are looking for. Ford continues to be one of the cheapest "staple" stocks that you can buy on a PE basis and the company's ongoing attractive yield makes it a fantastic DRIP candidate. As we've said, barring catastrophe, we plan on being long Ford for a long time to come and reinvesting the dividends. With the company at a jumping off point for global profitability and the equity priced at just 8.4x of what Ford is expected to earn next year, Ford is begging us to buy more. In general, Ford continues to be our preferred way to invest in the U.S. auto market. Here's a piece on why we have a target over $20. Again, we have to reiterate that we take a long-term view on the company. Source: Ford: Earnings Commentary Supports Our Bull Case, Domestic Growth Holding Up Disclosure: The author is long F.
