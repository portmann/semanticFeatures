Amazon Dash Could Be Big For Brands - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Apr.  1, 2015  9:47 AM ET  |  About: Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) , Includes: CLX , COST , KR , KRFT , PG , WMT by: Dana Blankenhorn Amazon Dash is a very simple Internet of Things button for creating shopping lists. The button is tied to major brands, which will benefit over store brands. While some are thinking it's an April Fool's joke, and others are wondering what this means for shopping , Amazon.Com (NASDAQ: AMZN ) has given a huge boost for brands with its Dash button. Each button carries the logo of a branded product. Each one is designed to be placed where that product is used. Press the button when you're about to run out of that product, and your WiFi will take that signal to a shopping cart, from which the order can be quickly fulfilled. Only branded merchandise is going into the program, from companies like Clorox (NYSE: CLX ), Proctor & Gamble (NYSE: PG ), and Kraft (NASDAQ: KRFT ). It's Amazon's first foray into the Internet of Things, a home inventory application that builds shopping lists at the point of use. Home inventory is sort of the low-hanging fruit. It's the cheapest area to implement, next to home entertainment, where Amazon already has its Fire Stick, linking WiFi to the selection of Internet-based TV programming. WiFi becomes a platform for applications that literally live in the air, tied to single-chip computers with specialized applications for monitoring conditions and controlling them. In that world the Dash buttons are super-simple, and super-cheap. They are, as the name implies, just on-off switches. What complexity will exist will be in the shopping cart, which customers maintain through their connection back to Amazon. They are truly an IoT 1.0 application. Eventually, as cheap chips become more powerful, you'll be able to monitor the condition of what you have, and the quantity of what you have, not just its existence, and have shopping lists built on-the-fly. What Amazon wants, when that happens, is to be ready on the back end, to get its store at the front of the line for fulfillment, and to make it the only choice for high-end consumers. While Amazon originally made its name with low, low prices, it's now trying to sell convenience, and automate the buying process. This isn't about shopping, it's about buying, about taking shopping out of purchasing entirely. You can click between the products Amazon offers, and their prices, and compare them to what the competition offers. Sometimes, as with Tide, Amazon's price is best. In others, as with Glad drawstring trash bags, other merchants have better pricing. But that's not the point of Dash. The point of Dash is to eliminate the price-comparison process from the buying experience. It's also to eliminate the product-comparison process from the buying experience, and this may be more important. They're not offering diapers, they're offering Huggies. They're not offering baby food, they're offering Gerber. If you previously used a different brand, you're going to be challenged with Dash - at least until Amazon decides to offer different brands. Chances are, the high-end target market for Dash isn't going to care, and if Dash gains traction it could move market shares. The technology is so simple, however, that it is brand-name stores who may eventually benefit first. Amazon has shown the way for Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) to further automate the construction of shopping lists, for Costco (NASDAQ: COST ) to automate the construction of shopping lists, and for Kroger (NYSE: KR ) to further automate the construction of shopping lists. The bigger retailers are about to get much, much bigger. Source: Amazon Dash Could Be Big For Brands Disclosure: The author is long AMZN, COST, KR.
