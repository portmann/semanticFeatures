I could post an image of what that might look like, except I can't. Wed, 01/13/2016 - 14:54 | 7041670 DormRoom Most of Amazon's recent operating net  income is from its cloud services, and not the retail unit. i.e. the 100+ unicorns in Silicon Valley using EC2 and cloud storage.  Once the tech bubble pops, amazon's cloud services will suffer a huge retreat, and likely go back to generating negative earnings, because of the excess cloud capacity. Most of the EC2/AWS services are already paid through 2016. You get a huge discount and other incentives doing that. 2017 forecasts are where Amazon will feel the Fed's cock punches.

After government subsidized cloud BS reprehensible rentier outfit, electric car fiasco, useless and ridiculously expensive battery con, another disaster rocket toy play from another apartheid boy but this time entirely for taxpayer money. Boy, they all earned every badge of SV technology psychedelic gurus. Those psychotic, cash bloated, inbred retards and Wall Street perverts, in their wet Ponzi dream are fornicating with those mentally challenged Silicon Valley megalomaniacs, squirting â€œgreenâ€? feces off their rotten minds onto faces of hard working US taxpayers, during their cerebral herpes induced seizures of sick imagination, calling it creative disruption. And loving it. I guess, unable to get hard on with sex, booze and drugs they get high of orgasmic chaos, blow up toys and inhumane exploitation of their cheerleading, gadget addicted serfs.
