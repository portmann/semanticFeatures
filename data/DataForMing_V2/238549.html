PayPal: Improving Leverage Outweighs Industry Threats - PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) | Seeking Alpha Stone Fox Capital , Stone Fox Capital (1,554 clicks) PayPal is making strides to improve leverage after the split from eBay. Apple Pay, along with other payment options, are viable threats that are likely to cause volatility in the stock. The stock trades at an attractive valuation compared to the potential for digital payment growth that includes emergent mobile and P2P. The interesting part of the PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL ) story is the digital payments provider has a business similar in size to MasterCard (NYSE: MA ). The payments network provider is generally seen as a bigger company due to the market valuation of nearly $110 billion, but both companies are on pace to soon pass an annual revenue run rate of $10 billion. My previous research recommended starting a position in PayPal during the late September dip. The question is whether investors should continue loading up with the stock after a rally over $35 and after reporting mixed Q3 results. The split from eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY ) provides the opportunity for PayPal to grow the business and fine tune operating expenses to improve margins that wasn't always a focus under eBay. In the last quarter , PayPal grew operating margins by 200 basis points to 20%. The number pales in comparison to MasterCard that generates margins in excess of 50%. As a strong example of the leverage in the business now, normal operating expenses that don't include transaction costs and losses only grew 7% with a large portion of those higher expenses due to more general and administration expenses after the split. The number trailed the reported revenue growth rate of 15% and currency neutral growth of 19%. The drive to control expenses improves the incentive to invest in the stock considering the strong growth initiatives. PayPal continues to grow both the number of active accounts along with the transactions per active customer. The market is increasingly moving to digital payments with the shift towards mobile and P2P payments providing solid growth for the digital payments provider. Mobile payments volumes continue to accelerate with 38% growth during Q3 to 345 million transactions. The Venmo P2P payments product grew total payments volume by 200% YoY to $2.1 billion. As a note, the fears over Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) entering the P2P payments space via Apple Pay is a concern. The product reportedly will compete against Venmo, but the key point is the product only contributes a fraction of the $70 billion in payments volumes processed by PayPal and zero revenue at this point. Analysts are even mixed on the potential impact of Apple Pay. Gener Munster of Piper Jaffray sees a bigger concern of the service being incorporated into mobile browser payments by 2017. PayPal currently obtains roughly 24% of payment volumes from mobile though only 50% of that is estimated from iOS devices. Other analysts like Citigroup's Ashwin Shirvaikar feel the threat of Apple Pay is overstated due to likely issues with payments to non-iOS services amongst other potential stumbling blocks for Apple. The vast adoption of Venmo and a device-agnostic approach provides an advantage that Apple will find difficult to surpass. With all of the positive trends, PayPal trades at an elevated valuation of 23x 2016 EPS estimates. The key though is that PayPal generated 31% EPS growth in Q3. The company is riding the trend towards digital payments via mobile and deserves the high valuations due to consistent growth in customers and transactions. The company will face numerous threats from other entrants into the payments sector, but investing in the market expert at a reasonable price is generally the best option. The recommendation remains to buy the stock on dips caused by market fears while PayPal continues improving operations after the split from eBay.
