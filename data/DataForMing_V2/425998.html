Verizon Communications (VZ) Management Discussion at Bank of America Merrill Lynch 2016 Media, Communications & Entertainment Conference - (Transcript) | Seeking Alpha Okay, thanks everybody for joining us for the first afternoon session. I am Dave Barden, Bank of America Merrill Telecom Analyst based in New York. And with me, very pleased to have with us in London Fran Shammo, the Chief Financial Officer of Verizon. Thanks Fran for making the trip, appreciated. And my – the format I think we’ll do a little kind of fireside chat here to start-off and let’s get to maybe some Q&A from the guests towards the end and hopefully wrap up it in about 45 minutes or so. I guess, it’s an opportunity, Fran, I guess for us to kind of maybe really check-in here. I think at the end of the first quarter call, you guys flagged that the function of the strike that was ongoing at the time that you would want to maybe check in later in the quarter and kind of give people an update as to what might have been going on, obviously in the interval, we’ve seen a resolution, that it appears to be a resolution awaiting ratification along those lines. And so I wanted to kind of duly make that check in and see where we stand with the unions and kind of what you saw happen over the course of the quarter and any other color you can share. Sure. Well, thanks. Hello everyone. First let me just reference our forward-looking statements that’s on our website and in front of you today. So let’s just start out with coming out of the first quarter. Obviously, we had about 46,000 of our wireline employees who went on strike. We have concluded that negotiation. It was a six-week long strike. And so, when we look at the quarter, we are looking at potentially a $0.05 to $0.07 impact to the earnings for the quarter related to that strike and why is that? It’s really two-fold. Number one, obviously, we have to get management to go out. We pay a lot of overtime to our management employees to cover for the strike. We also have to hire a lot of contractors that we then have to pay, because we didn’t fulfilled the contract with them for the duration that we had. So, there is a combination of that and then the other thing that we find too during the strike is, most of our management employees work on repair and maintenance type. So we don’t do much installation and if you think about accounting rules, when you do an installation on FIOS, you actually get to capitalize the labor as part of that installation. While if you are only working on repair and maintenance jobs and not doing installation, then you have a shift between capital to expense. So some of the pressure that we are seeing in the P&L is that shift and what you’ll see is, wireline capital will actually come down in the second quarter. So the cash piece of that is neutral to us, but for the P&L side, you’ll see about $0.05 to $0.07 impact to the bottom-line for the quarter. As far as the contract goes, I will talk more about the contract and some of the parameters around the contract on the second quarter call and the reason I won’t do it right now is because, the represented force has not ratified the contract, which means they have not accepted the terms yet. So we can’t really talk about it until they ratify. The ratification is scheduled for June 17. So, we’ll have more to say about that on the second quarter call David. All right, maybe a couple quick follow-ups on that. I guess, number one, could you kind of talk about any impacts that maybe measurable on kind of the broadband, the FIOS the wireless add side as it kind of happened in the quarter? Sure. So on the wireless side of the half there really hasn’t – you really won’t see any impact on the wireless side of the half. So it will be a normal quarter for wireless. As far as adds on wireline goes, I said, we spent most of our times on repairs and maintenance. So the actual net adds of wireline will be negative for the quarter. Now, obviously, our employees are back to work where we are doing installations here in the month of June. So, I don’t actually know the exact number that we’ll end in the quarter, because now we are in catch-up mode, because we did have a pipeline build during the strike. It’s a matter of how much we can get to that pipeline, but I would expect TV and broadband to be negative for the quarter. And I think, I think that there was a question as to, how long the strike lasted that it might have an impact on some of the legacy contractual expectations for healthcare contributions and other things that would be a benefit to the second half of the year? Is there any risk to that now? Is that put that into a degree assuming ratification? If we get it ratified, I’ll talk more about that on the second quarter, but that has been put to that if the ratification fall through – go through. Got it. So really what – maybe if we were kind of thinking, I know we are going to talk about the full year at the quarter, but we were trying to kind of wrap our heads around it, so maybe a nickel $0.06 in the second quarter, plus, whatever kind of residual impact there is from that lag in installs in the second quarter rolling into 3Q but, it sounds contained in general? Yes, it’s contained, but the $0.05 to $0.06 will flow to the end of the year. We are not going to make that $0.05 to $0.06 up at this point. So, I would just roll that through. And I know that, a lot of people out there speaking with you at the conference were kind of asking the question about, what – let’s just ignore the new contract for a second, but in terms of 2017 growth, I think that you’ve been talking that there would be more normal growth rate in 2017, which I think has been mid to high-single-digits kind of conversation. Does this – is there anything about this exercise materially alter that outlook? No, I mean, when we talk about 2017 in our outlook, I mean, I’ve referenced to the fact that I believe we will get back to a GDP type growth company on the top-line and I know I’ve gotten a lot of questions as to, well, how – why do you think that way, Fran? Well, some of this is just pure math. I mean, if you look at the Verizon wireless side of the equation, Verizon wireless service revenue is under pressure because of the switch from the subsidy model to the unsubsidized model. So service revenue is getting compressed here as we shift to equipment revenue. Coming out of the first quarter that was 6.2% decline, and we’ve said that, as soon as we hit 50% of our customers on that unsubsidized pricing model which is coming out of the first quarter was 48%. As we get to 50% and start to turn the corner on that 50%, the service revenue will also start to turn. So you are going to go from 6.2%, something less than that and the decline will lessen and as we do our math forecast by fourth quarter of 2017 we’ll actually be back to accretion in service revenues. So, pure math would show there is going to be a lot less headwind in 2017 than there was in 2016, plus you have the comps. And then, when you roll in some of the other things that we’ve been working on like, AOL, Go90, Verizon Digital Media services, Telematics, they start to gain more momentum in 2017. So that’s what makes me comfortable to say GDP type growth. Then from a bottom-line perspective, what we said is, the last two years, we’ve had unusual transactions. Vodafone contributed a 10% one-time benefit to earnings per share. So as you roll through the accounting benefit of the EIP plan, when you get to 2017, you get back to more of a equalized growth rate for the bottom-line and I am not disclosing what that is. You can go back in time and look at Verizon’s normal growth rates and that’s what the box will be put in. Got it. So, I guess, another kind of key topic related to the things something you were talking about on EIP is, there is a – we were talking to AT&T about that this morning too as, kind of what expectations are for the handset cycle in 2017. We saw a very, very low upgrade rate in the first quarter. It’s unclear whether that’s because people are choosing to keep their phones longer or because they are waiting to maybe make an upgrade in the back part of the year, and so, there is this question as to whether 2016 will look more like the 2014 iPhone 6 upgrade cycle or the 2015 iPhone 6s upgrade cycle. Can you give us any color in terms of what your expectations are on that? Yes, so it’s actually too early to tell exactly what the trend represents. I mean, we saw a very similar trend back in the first quarter of 2014 where upgrades really slowed and it’s because, people have been trained that there is an upgrade cycle every two years coming out of Apple. So, we are coming up to that two year cycle at the end of this year. It’s going to depend on what that, that device looks like. I have no idea what that looks like. So that will drive some of the behavior, but the other thing that we don’t know is, that the slowdown happened because people are expecting another upgrade or this slowdown happened because this EIP thing has been in the makes now for two to three years and our people now saying, oh, I got a 20 to 25 reduction in my bill, I am going to keep the same phone and just pay the service pricing at the reduced rate. I can’t answer that question, because our first generation of EIP just matured at the first quarter. So I need some time to see what the trend is on the upgrade cycle. My personal view is that I think that the upgrade will look more like 2015 than it did in 2014 for a bunch of different reasons. And keep in mind though, that the volume of upgrade now going into the future because of the installment plan in EIP, whatever you want to call it, there is less impact. In the old days, when volume went up, profits went down. That’s going to be more equalized now because you don’t have that huge subsidy that you are taking in a high volume quarter. So, again I would expect the P&L to look more like 2015 than it did in 2014 as the EIP model continues to mature. Got it. And, just on the – as you say the maturation of the EIP business, I think that you’ve publicly talked about looking at it – looking at financing of handsets or factoring of handsets or financing handsets in new ways, is there any update on kind of how that’s unfolding? Yes, so I’ve said the last couple of times, publicly, that we have been looking at for over a year now alternatives to really looking at ways to finance the handsets, because I don’t want to be in the finance business. So, we’ve looked at – we have been securitizing through our membership banks on an off-balance sheet type basis. So, strictly of securitization, a couple things with that, one, that cash then when we securitize which is about $2 billion a quarter flows through cash flow from operations. But it’s generally at a little bit higher cost and it’s also kind of degrades our rating because the rating industries take that securitization and add it back to our unsecured debt. So one of the things that we have been looking at is, what if we convert it to the asset-backed security market which is a public market, and also, using banks to be in on-balance sheet would be more like the ABS type instrument. We’ve been working with the rating agencies over the last year on how they would view us being more of a asset-backed security in securing these investments and if you’ve looked at it, both S&P and Fitch have recently written up that they will treat the industry if you will more of a captive on this type of asset-backed security. That actually gives us a benefit in our ratings from a debt perspective because this now won’t be added to my unsecured debt. It will be treated as a separate pool of financing short-term asset-backed security debt similar to the auto industry and so forth. So there is a benefit from a borrowing perspective, because a lot of this will be rated Triple A. So there is a benefit to my borrowing cost and it also gives me a rating benefit. Now, one thing you should be aware of for the second quarter is, I will not be securitizing anything in the second quarter on the off-balance sheet method. So you will see about a $2 billion swing in cash flow from operations, because I am not going to securitize via the old instrument. What you’ll see then though is, going into the third quarter, so we have a little bit of a timing issue here, going into the third quarter, you’ll see us go out to the public market to start financing the old securitization in on the on-balance sheet method. So you are going to see this geography-changing cash flow because this will now be included in financing rather than cash flow from operations. So you will see a geography change for us as we build up the public market versus the off-balance sheet weeding that off, you will continue to see that for about the next year as we move into a full fledged asset-backed security model and then cash flow from operations again will equalize out and get back to a normal view. So, we’ll talk more about this on the second quarter, but we will be changing the way we finance these receivables. And what is the kind of cost differential on a couple billion dollars of quarterly financing that you are getting? Well, I’ll wait till we do that and then, we can – you’ll be able to see that, I am not going to get into the actual cost differential. But there is a cost benefit to using the asset-backed security market, but it’s a beneficial because of the high-quality of our base and some of this will be rated as Triple S. So there is a cost benefit there rather than using off-balance securitization with the banks. So it’s not just that what’ll happen it would take this kind of securitization out of the unsecured basket and bring overall leverage down, that should probably give us the benefit for the totality of the debt, but there is actual cost benefit for the ABS market versus the securitized bank market today. That is correct. And what’s your kind of visibility that the ABS market for these receivables is big enough to accommodate your needs? Yes, I mean, we’ve done a lot of work, I mean, Scott Krohn here is in this room with me as the Treasurer and he has done some road shows with individuals and investors who would buy those type of security and from a company like Verizon, and the quality of these receivables, there is demand out there for this. And do you think that that’s maybe uniquely the purview of Verizon to kind of develop this market? Maybe other – you would say that some other handset receivables aren’t going to make the cut? Well, I mean, I am certainly not developing the market. The audio industry has been in this market for years. So, this is a pretty steady market. I mean, yes, I mean for our industry, this is new for the industry, but this market has been out there for years. So, again, we’ll talk a lot more about this once we go public with the instrument, you’ll be able to see it and we can talk more about that. Got it. And so just another kind of more asset and cash flow related to that and we’ve heard that there continues to be pretty healthy activity in the datacenter sales market. We just had a pretty healthy multiple from the Equinix sale the Digital Realty at 13 times, CenturyLink, has there assets up for sales we heard and they seem to be pretty positive about the activity level around it. It’s been quiet from Verizon for a little while on this issue. I was wondering could you give us an update on that one too? Well, we are progressing. Part of our slowdown was that, a lot of the buyers wanted to see financial statements by datacenter and obviously at a company our size, we don’t keep financial statements by datacenter. So, we had to go back and put some financials together for the investors to see exactly by datacenter, what the revenue and costs were and commitments and so forth. So we worked through that and so, I would anticipate over the next three months, we’ll have more to report whether we move forward or we don’t move forward. Got it. You are going to hate me for doing this, but, I just have to go ahead and ask you about the Wall Street your article that just came out five minutes ago that everyone just e-mailed me about to ask you about, that we are in the second round now. We heard reports about AT&T being in the market for maybe these assets. What does it mean to Verizon if they win – if you win or don’t win does it matter to Verizon? Look, I am not going to talk a lot about the Yahoo process or Yahoo itself. But, look, I mean, obviously, we’ve gone on a strategic roadmap here around Mobile First activity while we purchased AOL for the ADTECH platform. AOL has brought a lot of viewership to the platforms. And you are going to see us over this next three to six months start to a cross-pollinate our products utilizing the Verizon Digital Media Services platform and when I say cross-pollinate, I mean, the GO90 asset more integrated with the AOL asset, so that we can broaden the viewership. And then really, I mean, when you get down to it, viewership matters, because viewership drives advertising dollars, which drives the top-line revenue. So, when you think about viewership, Yahoo has viewership, okay, so that’s all I am going to say about that. We’ll see whether we move forward or we don’t move forward. But, that’s really – it doesn’t really matter to me whether we do or we don’t. We have to build upon what we have and build upon what we have is creating more views to our platform to generate advertising dollars to monetize the data feeds that we are talking about and the content that we have. So that’s really the general purpose of this. Great. Thank you. So, I want to use that as a jumping our platform to maybe zoom out a bit, and then, because I think that in Europe there has been all sorts of quad play models and MVNOs and in the U.S. too, we’ve probably seen a more starkly divided approach to the market. There is a national video, wireless platform. There is some regional video, Wi-Fi MVNO platforms that are emerging. And then there is Verizon which has basically kind of a nationwide wireless-first type of model. And I am wondering, kind of how you describe the landscape emerging in the U.S. and why the Mobile First strategy is the best one as opposed to having a video like legacy linear video business that goes along with it to private content rights and all those things? Yes, so, let’s start at a real macro level. So as we look at the world if you will, and we look at our ecosystem, we look at it that says, the world is moving to a broadband wireless world. Now, I am really – when I say world, I am really talking the U.S., right. So, but I do think the world is moving to a wireless world. That’s where people are going to consume content, that’s where people are going to want to consume their data and their TV. So when we look at the U.S., broadband, wireless, that’s three to five years, that’s where people have – how people will consume. So when you think about the macro and you look at just the broadband piece, obviously, we believe we have the state-of-the-art broadband connection with our FIOS assets. But that’s East Coast-centric, right, and we’ll continue to build on that. Obviously, we said, we would build up Boston now, because it makes sense from a LTE perspective, we can spend $300 million over the next three years to make that more palatable to expand FIOS. So we will continue to expand that broadband connection via fiber where it makes financial sense for us. The next piece is wireless. So when you look at wireless, the wireless pie just continues to grow and why does it continue to grow? Well, if you look at the millennial population, how they consume content is mostly via wireless and then secondary broadband. If you look at internet of things, that is all wireless. Now some internet of things will run off of Wi-Fi, but for the majority as you look at the mobile world and you think about autonomous cars and you think about smart cities and medical devices that track people, I mean, that’s going to run off of a wireless network. And you can already see from the first quarter, we launched some in the fourth quarter and we had over a 100,000 adds and that marketplace is a 150 million vehicles in the United States. So, the pie is going to grow. So, if you look at the industry and the pie grows, more people are going to want to enter that pie, but it doesn’t mean that the four carriers who provide wireless service get any less of the pie, because the pie grows. So the industry itself, I believe, will continue to grow. Now as far as how we play in that, we believe that FIOS will continue to penetrate and grow, because we are underpenetrated in the marketplaces we have, but it’s a contained footprint. Then when we go to wireless, why do we think that our wireless strategy is right? Well, look, I mean, if you look at the population and how people’s eye just content, most people are not going to look at long form content on a mobile device. They are going to sit in their house, they are going to digest that through a broadband connection, linear TV is still here, but we all know that linear TV is slowly declining and will continue to slowly decline over time. And this population that we are talking about with 30 and below is gradually disconnecting linear TV and going to get their content from other means, whether it’s over-the-top or short form content for mobile. So when we look at the ecosystem, we believe that there is a large opportunity in Mobile First content. And so, if you look at what we’ve done with GO90, it has sports which you consider is long form. It has news and then it has its creative content that’s bringing some of the viewerships into the view. The other thing though too is, if you look at what I’ve done, I am not asking the consumers to subscribe to anything. So they are not paying for a subscription. It’s free to the consumer and you don’t need to be a Verizon customer to downloads that often consume that data. You can be sitting in your home, technically, all GO90 is over-the-top, and you can be sitting on someone else’s wireless network and enjoying that. So, I am attacking a population that is more than just the Verizon Wireless population. I am attacking people who are sitting at home that want to digest that GO90 content and people who are on mobile that want to digest that mobile content. So we believe that, the future is, I want to fill up the ten times a day that you have 10 minutes free, I want you to come to my platform and digest 10 minutes of content from GO90. And that’s really the theory of business case. I am not downplaying the over-the-top model. There are plenty of competitors today, whether you look at NetFlix, HULU, whether it be Apple, others who come along the way that want to do over-the-top. That ecosystem is going to be there, but the question is, that’s going to be so congested and what we are trying to do is create something that’s very unique and different than everybody else with linear TV. Let me ask – just a follow-up question on, it seems like one of the premises of the strategy is that the long form content isn’t going to get consumed in the mobile environment, because what’s getting consumed in the mobile environment right now is short form. But, are those two things necessarily true? Can you not have both with it maybe not potentially be interesting to have both? Or are you limited from having both because you don’t have 20 million video customers that you can go to the content companies with and fight for those rights and present an option for the customers that they maybe not have today? Well, I guess, I would argue that, in most of our long form viewership content is on sports. I mean, so, if you look at NFL, you look at the NBA, you look at the Mexico Soccer League right now, I mean, they are watching that for an hour and a hour-and-a-half and I am not saying they are not watching them on the mobile device, they are, but it’s sports. So, when you think about linear content, today, whether you are a Comcast subscriber or FIOS subscriber or a Direct TV subscriber, you have the ability to take all of that content out of your home today and view it on mobile. All you have to do is authenticate back to your subscription in the home. And again, I come back to the differentiation here is, is I am not asking you to subscribe to anything. You don’t have to pay for a subscription. You can just download the APP and watch where you want to watch without authenticating to any other authentication or subscription model. And that’s really the difference here. I am not saying that long form content won’t be digested and I am not saying that eventually we may not add long form content. But right now, out of the gate, the concentration is around Mobile First content that short form 10 minutes max to 12, sports is outside of that, but it’s this news and short clip form that we are going after. And I know you’ve talked about, maybe sharing more on GO90 and what it’s become as a business from a metric standpoint. Is there any kind of color you can give us at this stage or is that still down the road? So I said that, third quarter would be about the timing of to when we’ll start to release some, if you want statistics or metrics around the GO90 platform and maybe some of the AOL assets. So we’ll have to mature this as we go, but probably in the third quarter and the reason for that is, is because, we’ve started out with GO90 there. We had to do some things with the platform. That has all now done and if you look at some of the ratings around GO90, they are starting to go up and it was because of some platform and platform issues. Now that we are through that. You’ll start to see some momentum gain again. And we are putting some really creative content out there with some of the complex and Awesomeness TV and Hertz deals that we’ve done. So more to come, but end of third quarter is more of the timing that we are looking at. Perfect. And so, so let’s kind of take that again and zoom out a little bit, which is, if – what you are saying is right, and you believe that kind of where we are moving is a more mobile environment, what that does is it suggests that the guys who are in the legacy linear environment want to become more mobile. And it just so happens that, both of these guys not only have very strong, and when I say both, I mean the two cable companies have very strong Wi-Fi footprints. They also have access to an MVNO of Verizon. And a lot of people wonder whether Verizon kind of has written itself into a problem with that relationship, because you’ve enabled the cable companies to get the exact thing that they would need to be able to compete against the thing that you are trying to take away from them. How do you put the MVNO with the cable companies in the context? Well, again, I am not going to specifically deal with the agreement itself, right. But look, as I said before, this pie grows. We went into the MVNO with open eyes when we acquired the spectrum. I would do that agreement again today. It was a good agreement we would certainly do that again today. And we’ve been in the reseller business, whether you call it an MVNO or reseller business, we’ve been in the reseller business for the last 24 years that I’ve been part of Verizon. So this is not a different ecosystem. And look, as I said in the very beginning, the pie grows and we know that people are going to want to come into that pie. Cable may come in, others may come in. But I think what we’ve shown over the history is, look, Verizon is a pretty fierce competitor. So, there is a quality of service with our network that you can’t get with others. Wi-Fi is an unmanaged network. There is quality of service today on Wi-Fi. I mean, most people in this room would realize that when Wi-Fi gets clogged, quality of service goes significantly down. It’s an unmanaged network. You can’t manage that. So, there are differences in that perspective. So when we look at scenario and play up, who could come in, how could they compete? Look, we are prepared for that. I mean, we are not sitting there on our hands, saying, oh life is good and we are not expecting competition. We are fine with competition and we believe we can compete in any environment. So we are separating ourselves with other things like, GO90. You look at 5G, we haven’t even talked about 5G and the capability that 5G brings to the table that I think also puts some cable companies on their back heels as potential competition for them. So, look, I mean, we are not standing still. We are moving forward. So, let me ask one question related to that and then, let’s go ahead and talk for a nano thinking about 5G at the top. But on – so, if you say that the MVNO is a good deal, you do it again, so as LTEs came to Verizon and said, could we please have a deal that you’ve done with other cable companies? You’d say, sign on the dotted line. Yes, I mean, we have to. I mean, we would have to do that, because that’s part of some of our DOJ and equal and net neutrality type of things. So, yeah, I mean, we are perfectly fine with that and the way we set up GO90 by the way is GO90 is actually running out – let’s call it a welfare firm, for a better terms, we really haven’t named anything. GO90 actually buys under that same agreement from wireless. So, wireless itself is an entity that has to generate profit based on the utilization of their network. They are wholesaling now to GO90 and if Comcast does MVNO, they’ll wholesale through that MVNO to Comcast and so forth. So, from a Verizon Wireless’s perspective, I am perfectly fine with the MVNO. Okay. So, just touching in 5G for a second, I mean, look, all – we’ve all got very levels of familiarity with the 5G is supposed to be and what not. I think, Verizon kind of really catalyzed this conversation and there is a lot of good reason to get regulators off the dime to get vendors innovating. But I think as an investor, we get kind of confused as to what exactly we are supposed to put into our income statement forecast for 2018, because Verizon has got 5G. So, I guess, there is two ways to look at, there is the CapEx side, what does it mean to the investment and then what does it mean to the returns. Is it something what I should do in my model for 5G? Okay. So, here is the way you think about it. First let’s start with CapEx. Keep in mind that 5G is not a replacement technology for LTE. LTE will be here for a very long time and be the predominant voice, text, data platform for mobile. Let’s classify it that for all enhancement purposes. So when you look at LTE, currently what we are doing at Verizon is we are densifying the network, when I say densifying, we are doing a lot of small cells, a lot of in-building, a lot of antenna systems. And we are doing that for the densification capacity needs to deliver performance to customers who continue to use LTE. You view that as, that’s a pre-requisite to being able to launch 5G at some point down the road, because 5G is a line-of-sight technology. It runs off a very high frequency we are looking at 28 gigahertz to 39 gigahertz. It’s a line-of-sight, so you have to have it densified network in order to have that line-of-sight. So when you think about small cells, the more small cells you have, the better 5G you will be able to what, to create. Things are about that, so as we are incurring the capital to install those small cells today to deliver LTE, I will come over the top and just install 5G into that cell. And then the only that happens beyond that is, what happens in the home that I would be doing with FIOS today, but at a much reduced cost, because there is no labor to dig up your front lawn, lay in fiber, or be able to fix something, whether it’s on your window or somewhere to receive that line-of-sight signal, deliver it to a router and then you have Wi-Fi in the home. So, think about it at that rate. So, there is really no CapEx increase that comes along with 5G. As far as what’s the use case? The use case rate now is fixed wireless broadband. And it can get is being designed – 5G is designed for 1 gigabit of speed. Now I know others will claim a lot more at the same with LTE, when you have an empty network, you can get a lot of speed out of something that has nobody on it. But, it’s being designed for a 1 gigabit of data and that’s what being proven in Japan and Korea who are much further ahead than the U.S. in deployment. So, when you think about the use case, it’s fixed wireless broadband. As far as modeling goes, I think there is two hurdles that we still have to get through before we start talking about a wide commercial launch here in the U.S. One is, the standards have to be set around 5G. Now, we would love to set that standard on a global basis and we are working with South Korea and Japan on trying to establish that to get that standards set and the reason you want the standards set is because, it makes it much more efficient for everybody to buy the hardware from the manufacturers, because they have to – they only have to build to one spec and that’s beneficial to the industry and beneficial to the manufacturer. The second is, obviously spectrum, because there is no 28 gigahertz to 39 gigahertz spectrum in large slots today that’s available to be used other than what we actually have an option on XO. And when we did the XO deal, which hopefully will close late this year, early next year, we have an option to buy the 28 gigahertz if the standard is set. If the standard is not set at 28 and goes to 39, then obviously we wouldn’t exercise that option. But we have to work with the FCC. The FCC has to work with the Department of Justice to free up that spectrum and get it to the marketplace. So the timing of that, I don’t know, but that’s – in order to go commercial, we have to have more spectrum than what’s there today. And it’s not like you can – probably and it’s not inconceivable that you could bundle what’s there today, like AWS, but it would be extremely inefficient and very, very costly. So you need to get 28 and 39, because of the millimeter wave and how you deliver this signal. So, it’s spectrum that still have to come. We got, maybe five more minutes left. Is there questions that people want to throw out there or I can keep going? Three questions for me, all right. Next question would be, just regulatory, kind of real quick, maybe we do a lighting round if you want? So, the special access order, I can’t - I am not so sure I understand, does Verizon oppose it, but reluctantly endorse a technology neutral push if it’s going to happen or do you guys now support it and if so, for why did you support change? Well, first off, we don’t like regulation period, right. But if we are going to be regulated, and it appears that that’s where the FCC wants to go, then all we are saying is, if you are going to regulate, then regulate the entire ecosystem and this goes for, whether it’s open access on networks or it’s privacy. Get it across the ecosystem, don’t pick winners and losers. And so, that’s really the basis of it. Okay, so you prefer not to happen, but if it’s going to happen better to be technology neutral than not? And the upside that you see for that would be, well if the cost could potentially some net revenues in territory, the opportunity is to leverage the cable platform more independently, I guess, to deploy fiber builds for 5G in markets and so there is a – the silver lining in the cloud. All we are saying is, if you are going to regulate Verizon and AT&T on access, then regulate everybody that has networks which includes the cable companies. So don’t pick winners and losers. So if you are going to open it up to everybody, open it up to everybody and force everybody to open their networks, don’t pick winners and losers. And the same with privacy, if you are going to regulate the carriers on privacy, then regulate the other people on the other side of the equation who don’t follow any privacy rules. Make the ecosystem equal within – across the board and that’s what we are saying. That was my second one was on privacy. So the FCC has assumed some authority to set privacy rules for carriers on the FTC, the Fair Trade Commission is regulating privacy for the internet carriers and you’ve got AOL kind of in the middle somewhere. How does that all work for Verizon? Well, it’s aligned, that’s a problem, because you have two different regulatory agencies and the FCC requires us to abide by one set of rules and the FCC is much more open. So, if you look at Google and Facebook, it seems that they can pretty much do anything and not get any penalty for privacy violation. We are contained that says we are not allowed to use any individual data unless there is an opt-in or an opt-out feature. So what we are saying is, if you are going to regulate, again regulate the entire ecosystem. Make a fair playing field across the ecosystem and get it right, if you are going to regulate. And maybe just a last question. We’ve been waiting for the - kind of open internet order to kind of get resolved in the courts here. Any timing update that we are going to see, any outcomes kind of intelligence that you’ve gotten from the ground? I don’t have any timing at this point, but the one comment I would make is, look, this doesn’t really change the way we do business. I mean, net neutrality, we abide by net neutrality. There is no carrier out there that has ever been accused of prioritizing data. So, the way we’ve set our operations up, we are in full compliance with it. Again, we just don’t think regulation benefits innovation than anyone else. Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.
