Some Marriott Hotels Will Offer Guests Access To Netflix On Room TVs â€“ Consumerist Whoops! It looks like portions of our site are being blocked! Check your browser settings or contact your network administrator. Because not everyone wants to watch programming on a laptop or tablet while they’re away from home, Marriott Hotels has partnered with Netflix to offer access to the streaming service on room TVs to guests staying at certain Marriott locations. It seems its tests of in-room streaming access were successful : Marriott has added the Netflix app to hotel room Internet-connected TVs at six locations thus far, and has plans to add it at six others this summer, the company announced in a press release today. Guests at those locations can either start a new Netflix subscription via the app or sign in to their existing accounts. “Our collaboration with Netflix responds to changing consumer preferences in the way our guests access and watch content, while recognizing the leading role Netflix is playing in driving this transformation,” said Matthew Carroll, vice president brand management, Marriott Hotels says in a statement. “Because consumers are choosing to take their streaming content with them when they travel, Marriott Hotels is making the industry’s first rollout of Netflix a priority.” Guests will only have to login once to their Netflix accounts throughout their stay. If you’re worried you’ll have the next guest eyeing your viewing history, Marriott says that when guests check out all their account information is “wiped clean” from the televisions. Let’s hope that happens, or there could be some very amused staffers wondering how you could watch that many episodes of Charmed in two days. Perhaps setting a reminder to sign out yourself would be a good idea, just in case. Marriott says it plans to expand Netflix to 100 hotels by the end of 2015, and to nearly all of its more than 300 locations in the U.S. by the end of 2016.
