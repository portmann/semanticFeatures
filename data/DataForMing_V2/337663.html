AT&T Vs. Verizon - Part II: Which Company Better Rewards Shareholders? - AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) | Seeking Alpha Both companies generate very similar amounts of free cash flow. They also invested similar amounts of capital back into the business in the past five years. It isn't a surprise that they are highly correlated, but this might be set to change as company directions diverge. Verizon remains more of a wild card pick in 2017 and beyond; T remains the safer play for income investors. The debate over whether AT&T (NYSE: T ) or Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) is the better stock is one that has existed for quite some time. Historically, these companies have been highly correlated and move together (correlation coefficient of 0.95, where 1 is perfect correlation), but I do believe that company strategy by respective managements are diverging, and this correlation will loosen over the next several years. The discussion matters because one (or both) remain highly key components of most retail investor income portfolios, and while I've weighed in on why I believe AT&T makes the better pick based on long-term company direction , that doesn't necessarily mean that T makes the most sense for an income-oriented investor. In order to properly evaluate a holding for an income portfolio, investor confidence in the company/shareholder relationship is nearly as important as confidence in the business model itself. So the question then is: "Which of these two companies has the better history of rewarding shareholders?" In order to find that out, it is always best to take a prudent look at both companies' free cash flow histories and traditional use of that cash. Sourced from company 10-K filings, author calculations Above, investors can find GAAP free cash flow for both companies. Key assumptions here include no breakout between maintenance and growth capital expenditures for AT&T and Verizon (overly conservative) and the fact that wireless spectrum auction purchases are considered business acquisitions, not capital expenditures - an accounting rule that I'm not quite fond of, and accept begrudgingly. Overall, AT&T has generated a marginal amount more of free cash flow over the past five years, which is fairly reflected by the company's slightly higher enterprise value. Both companies trade at very similar normalized cash flow yields, so it is difficult to make a base for either company simply based on cash flow valuation. In fact, the companies trade similarly on other valuations as well; both trade at roughly 12.5x expected earnings, and both trade at near 7x forward EV/EBITDA. Neither company has been skimping out on infrastructure build-outs. Capital expenditures track at roughly $100B for both companies, with AT&T edging out its lightly smaller competitor by a nose. Similarities between these two titans of industry are everywhere; it isn't a surprise once you've looked at the data that they trade nearly in tandem. Of course, investors in AT&T and Verizon are primarily income investors who are primarily interested exchanging their capital today for shareholder returns tomorrow. How have both companies fared in the shareholder returns department? Sourced from company 10-K filings, author calculations Now, this data can be interpreted multiple ways, and likely will be a point of contention. As an AT&T bull, I'll point out that the company has traditionally been the better play for investors seeking shareholder return. Of the $75B in free cash flow it has generated in the past five years, AT&T has returned all of it to investor pockets - and then some. Total shareholder returns ran $76.7B from 2011 to 2015. Verizon, by comparison, has been a poor returner of capital, depositing just $38B of the $71B in free cash flow back in investors' pockets over the same time period. With that said, 2015 obviously marked a massive change when it came to shareholder treatment. What gives? The $130B takeover of Vodafone's (NASDAQ: VOD ) 45% interest in Verizon Wireless was likely years in the making. Verizon knew that the bond market would simply not bear a $100B+ debt raise even during what was a period that saw massive appetite for corporate debt. The cash component of this deal ($58.9B) constituted 83% of free cash flow generated in the 2011-2015 period and the dilution from the share component increased annual dividend obligations $2.87B annually at the 2016 indicated annual dividend. Verizon knew it had to raise capital to make this deal more appealing to investors, and upping retained cash for several years, along with issuing dilutive equity, was the only way. Now, you can approach this two ways. With Verizon now owning Verizon Wireless 100%, it is free to return all its free cash flow to shareholders like its brother AT&T. The steps Verizon took in 2015 - returning substantially more than free cash flow to shareholders - were an important step in the direction of building that relationship with shareholders. $5B in share repurchases give a little credence that management is willing to back up its opinion that Verizon's equity is undervalued at current levels. However, one year does not necessarily make a trend, and is something to watch out for as VZ begins to lay the foundation of what constitutes normal shareholder returns. In a way, I've now come full circle. I was critical of the Verizon Wireless acquisition in my prior research note as management went "all-in" on the U.S. wireless market, and I'll be slightly critical of it here again. While my opinion has warmed slightly of late, my opinion that 2016 earnings per share and free cash flow will remain stagnant remains rather unchanged. AT&T is expected to grow earnings, and is more likely to bring less surprises for investors in the short term. Verizon's strategy is more direct, but in many ways that makes it more opaque, with results harder to predict. If you go out on the projected earnings curve, analyst opinion varies significantly more with Verizon than with AT&T; 2017 VZ earnings estimates vary from $3.49 to $4.46/share. This is significantly wider than what you'll find for AT&T; $2.61 to $3.10/share. You'll find this sentiment echoed in the options markets, where you'll find LEAPS for Verizon carry substantially more premium, indicative of the potential underlying volatility. That doesn't necessarily mean VZ is a bad pick if you have conviction in the name, and many investors do. But when structuring accounts built to generate income, safety and predictability is more the name of the game rather than banking on upside surprise in my opinion. I'll continue to recommend AT&T as my favored telecom pick for this reason.
