Judge voids $533 million verdict against Apple, sets damages trial | Reuters A federal judge has thrown out a $532.9 million damages award against Apple Inc after a jury found that its iTunes software infringed three patents owned by a Texas company. In a decision on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Rodney Gilstrap said his jury instructions might have "skewed" jurors' understanding of the damages that Apple should pay SmartFlash LLC, a licensing company that held the patents in dispute. Gilstrap set a new trial only on the issue of damages for Sept. 14 in Tyler, Texas.
