A Look At Boeing's Commercial Orders And Deliveries In Q3 - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Higher-than-expected deliveries in Q3 should result in robust earnings. In one of my previous articles , I had a look at Boeing's (NYSE: BA ) orders and deliveries in September. Although the monthly overview does give a nice picture of the order inflow, it has to be noted that order inflow does fluctuate quite a bit from one month to the other. Therefore, to somewhat average out the fluctuations, I will be looking at the quarterly orders and deliveries. Order inflow, as expected, is led by orders for the narrow-body family. 70% of the orders are for the Boeing 737 family. Order inflow for the Boeing 777 and Boeing 787 was weak during Q3. AeroAnalysis estimated the market value of the order inflow to be $12.8 bn In terms of value, the order inflow is a healthy mix: 55% of the market value comes from narrow-body aircraft while 45% of the order value comes from wide-body aircraft. This also clearly shows the importance of robust order inflow for the Boeing 777 and Boeing 787 program. Order inflow was down 13% compared to Q2; this is to be expected as order inflow edges higher in Q2 due to order finalizations during big air shows that take place in June. In Q3 and Q4, some of those orders are finalized and end up in Boeing's order books. So far, the company secured over 50 orders for the Boeing 777, which shows that BA is heading in the right direction to close (part of) the gap in the Boeing 777 production. Order inflow for the Boeing 787 has been weak year to date. While the number of orders tells something about the attractiveness of the product a manufacturer offers and the long-term prospects for the manufacturer, for short-term investors, deliveries are more interesting to look at. Since most of the cash comes in after delivering an airframe, it is important to meet the targeted number of deliveries in order to achieve the forecasted cash flow. As can be seen in Figure 2, Boeing exceeded the number of expected deliveries. This is primarily caused by higher Boeing 777 and Boeing 787 deliveries. BA's delivery target for the Dreamliner was 120 units, but the jet maker seems to be able to deliver 12 787 jets per month. The 199 orders have an estimated market value of almost $16bn. Looking at how this $16bn is split between narrow-body and wide-body aircraft shows the importance of high production rates of the wide-body aircraft: Although narrow-body aircraft represent 60% of the unit deliveries, it represents "only" 40% of the delivery value. During Q3, Boeing's book-to-bill ratio was .91, slightly below the full-year target of receiving 1 order for every airplane it delivers. Aided by some orders from China and some order inflow before year-end, I expect that the company will be able to reach its targeted book-to-bill ratio. What counts for short-term results are the deliveries since that is where bulk of the cash comes in. That is also where Boeing exceeded expectations, which means that the company probably will report solid Q3 earnings. BA is booking some progress on filling its order book for the Boeing 777, but it remains to be seen to what extent the company will be able to bridge this gap. Boeing beat its delivery target for the Boeing 787, which aids the jet maker in reaching a cash positive status on the 787 production.
