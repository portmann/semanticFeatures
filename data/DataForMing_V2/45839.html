Apple Has Cursed The Market - Cramer's Mad Money (4/30/15) | Seeking Alpha May.  1, 2015  7:35 AM ET  |  Includes: AAPL , BIDU , BWP , CGNX , COG , ETN , FUN , HAR , KMI , LPI , XOM by: SA Editor Mohit Manghnani Markets have been plunging lately and there are lot of theories like interest rates, Fed meeting, soft macro data being responsible for the fall. Cramer, however, is trying to make sense of the fall in his way. "I think that this market is all about Eve. Yeah, the original Eve who was tricked by the serpent into eating the forbidden Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) from the tree and the whole investor class has now been paying a price." Investors bought the stock before going into earnings, and the entire market is paying the price for that. The market will not bottom until Apple bottoms. Talking about the basics, investors buy stocks because they want the companies to fare well in earnings. When the numbers are better than analyst expectations, they raise the estimates. On top of that, if you get a dividend boost and a juicy buy-back, there's nothing like it. If the stock is at a discount relative to the average stock in the S&P500, it's like icing on the cake. Apple had all of these things and it still went down by approximately 4%. If a stock like Apple cannot go higher, then the entire rationale of buying stocks flips on its head. "Ever since we swallowed the Apple, the whole race of stocks seems cursed," said Cramer. He added that if the market does not care for the fundamentals of the biggest company, then it is bad news. If Apple's positive earnings can be skewed as negative news, then what can propel stocks? According to Cramer, once oil stops going up, and there is seller fatigue, along with a new winner like a bank or REIT, then the market can bounce back. Or, if Apple can rise from the ground, that will be positive for the entire market. "Oddly enough, though, I think that's the most likely scenario. I think Apple should be bought here," said Cramer. He added that it is always a good time to buy a high-quality stock with strong fundamentals like Apple. CEO interview - Eaton Corp. (NYSE: ETN ) Cramer cautioned investors that a change is happening and a weaker dollar will help companies that do business overseas. "Eaton Corp. is a classic industrial play with a huge exposure internationally that manufactures electrical control products, power management systems, hydraulics, truck transmissions and aerospace systems." Cramer has liked the stock for a long time and his charitable trust owns it. The company reported a strong quarter and has a good dividend yield. Does it have the power to go higher? Cramer interviewed CEO Alexander Cutler to find out more. "I think that many companies, ours too, experienced a pretty slow January and February, particularly here in the U.S. We were really pleased to see it recover in the third month of the quarter," said Cutler. While he expects forex to have a small impact on earnings this year, there are a lot of synergies from the acquisition that will help propel the bottom-line. Cutler is very bullish on the LED sales which are a substantial part of the business. Aerospace and commercial transport growth also appears to be strong. He expects the international conditions to improve as well. Commenting on the auto sector, Cutler said he sees the days before 2008 back. One question that Cramer keeps hearing is "is it time to buy oil?" Cramer answers in the negative, as he thinks the time to buy oil stocks is gone. There was a time to buy oil and that window has closed. Just because Exxon (NYSE: XOM ) reported good numbers, it does not mean that the worst is over. Exxon does not do terribly in bad times and does fine in good times. It does not tell anything about the state of the oil industry. Kinder Morgan (NYSE: KMI ) CEO Richard Kinder called the bottom in February. That is why they took the opportunity and bought Hiland Partners for $3B. As a result they now have control over the most important asset in the Bakken. Looking at the charts, almost all oil stocks show that we are at a bottom. Many distressed companies that offered stocks are much higher now. "That's what a bottom looks like, not these actions where many of these oil stocks have now shot up to where they were when oil was at $90. That's right, $30 higher than where it is now," said Cramer. CEO interview - Harman International (NYSE: HAR ) Cramer took a look at one of his favorite stocks, Harman International, which is the maker of high-end audio equipment for car stereos and professional grade gear. It is the epicenter of the connected car. The company reported a revenue miss in the last quarter and Cramer interviewed CEO Dinesh Paliwal to find out if the growth is sustainable. "Harman is all about leading the connected car, the automotive space. Nothing had changed. The auto sector is very strong, we came in very strong," said Paliwal. He added that 20% of the company's business is in professional audio which has dollar-denominated pricing. It does a lot of business in China, Russia and India where the economies have under-performed. He spoke about a research report that said there will be 220M connected cars by 2016. "We need to make safety the No. 1 parameter, and that is what we provide. We provide smart infotainment security," he added. On why they bought Symphony Teleca, Paliwal said that it was a strategic acquisition as it gives the company a cloud analytics platform that will help it make over-the-air updates to the connected car. "I am very comfortable, because I have done a lot of services business in my former life. But there's a tremendous synergy with what we do," added Paliwal. Cedar Fair (NYSE: FUN ): "I have no problem in buying Cedar Fair now." Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU ): "I am concerned as the Chinese market is overheated. It's best to take some money off the stock." Laredo Petroleum (NYSE: LPI ): Cramer is not a fan.
