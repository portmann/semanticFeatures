Will Apple, Russia And India Bring Back Up GLD? - SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSEARCA:GLD) | Seeking Alpha The recent FOMC release brought back up the price of GLD. The demand for gold in India is expected to rise this year. Apple’s new watch could also contribute to the higher demand for gold – but not by much. The recent FOMC meeting brought back some optimism to the gold market as shares of the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSEARCA: GLD ) has added 2.4% to its value last week. The demand for physical gold could start to pick up this year, but will this be enough to drive further up the price of GLD? Let's examine the latest from the FOMC and some changes in the physical demand for gold. The FOMC statement came out with a more dovish tone than previously projected. The Fed omitted the patient word from the statement, but it also revised down its projections about the progress of the U.S. economy - this includes GDP and inflation. This statement was enough to bring back up the price of GLD and provide some back-wind for the gold market. Despite the dovish tone, the market didn't change by much its projections about the first rate hike. The main difference is that the cash rate at the end of 2015 and 2016 is expected, based on the dot plot , to be lower than previously estimated. If the FOMC continues to lower the cash rate outlook, this could, down the line, bring back up the price of GLD - or at the very least keep it from falling further. Source of data taken from Gold Council's website Just to get a better idea of the some of the changes that could drive up the demand for gold. One of the leading countries in terms of gold consumption is still India (albeit China consumed more gold than India back in 2014). This year, India is expected to grow by 6.3% - this represents higher growth rate than in 2014. The higher growth in India's economy could suggest a rise in gold consumption, especially if the country's inflation will pick up again. Besides higher growth in India's GDP, the country's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has heated up the gold market as he lifted gold import restrictions; there are also plans to slash the import tax from 10% to 2%. Moreover, the government is also trying to improve the gold market in India by creating incentives for people to keep their gold in banks rather than their homes and establishing a sovereign gold bond. It seems that the changes to the import rules had some positive ramifications on the demand for the yellow metal as gold shipments rose in the first two months of the year. But past restrictions and high taxes actually created in the past an illegal route to import gold, which was estimated at 200 tons back in 2014. So lifting the restrictions and reducing import taxes may increase the demand for gold. Conversely, since more gold will be imported legally, this could also reduce the price of gold (illegal or restricted products tend to be priced with a premium). So it's unclear how all these factors will end up moving the price of GLD. The weakness in the gold market hasn't stopped central banks - most notably Russia and Kazakhstan - to stock up on gold mainly during the second half of last year. During that time frame, Russia's central bank purchased nearly 113 tons of gold. Source of data taken from Gold Council's website In January 2015, however, the demand for gold cooled down. The changes in the demand for gold by central banks didn't seem to have, at face value, a strong impact on the price of GLD. But if Russia continues to stock up on gold, as it did back in 2014, this could further tighten the gold market. One final note about the upcoming release of the Apple Watch: All eyes are set towards the potential growth in sales for Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), once the Apple Watch hits the stores next month and then the company's investors will realize whether this new product is a boom or bust. Analysts try and figure out what is up ahead for this new gadget; some have also drawn several assertions about what this product could mean for the gold market. In one place, the analyst concluded Apple could actually go through 746 tons of gold per annum - now that's a lot of gold! Even for the world's leading tech company. Based on these high figures, the conclusion was that the Apple Watch will drive higher the demand for gold, which, in turn, could also pressure back up the price of gold and related investments such as GLD. To put this figure in perceptive, back in 2014 , the total demand for gold was 3,924 tons. Based on this assumption, Apple will increase the global demand for gold by nearly 20%. Someone here on Seeking Alpha has talked about the problems with this assertion. I will only point out that even the amount of gold in the Apple Watch may not be 18 carat because Apple came up with a way of mixing gold with ceramic (so the metal won't scratch), and even though the percentage of gold atoms in this mixture is still 75% gold and 25% ceramic - i.e. 18 carat. But the ceramic particulars are larger; this means gold atoms are farther apart, so that in terms of volume the percentage of gold in this mixture will be less than 75%. Basically, Apple will use less gold to form this gold/ceramic mix, than in the standard 18 carat gold alloy. So, we could expect even less gold to be used for this watch than previously suggested. Bottom line, the Apple Watch could drive up the demand for gold, but I think the impact will be less strong than some suggest. I think that the gold market is still mostly dependent on the changes in the policies of central banks including the FOMC and ECB. The demand for physical gold could start to pick up mainly due to higher gold consumption in India, central banks keep stocking up, and even on account of Apple. But this isn't likely to drive much higher the price of GLD. The demand for gold on paper will likely keep leading the way for the progress of GLD's price. For more see: 3 Questions About Gold .
