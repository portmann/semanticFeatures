Carrizo Oil & Gas (CRZO) Sylvester P. Johnson on Q1 2016 Results - Earnings Call Transcript | Seeking Alpha Sylvester P. Johnson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director David L. Pitts - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC Marshall Hampton Carver - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC Chris S. Stevens - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Carrizo Oil & Gas First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, May 4, 2016. I would now like to turn the conference over to Chip Johnson, President and CEO. Please go ahead. Sylvester P. Johnson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director Thank you, operator, and thank you all for calling into our first quarter 2016 earnings call. Our management team is pleased to report another outstanding quarter for the company. Our net oil production of 25,806 barrels of oil per day was up 3% sequentially and represents another record level for the company. Our team has also continued to do an outstanding job managing our expenses as our unit costs declined by approximately 3% versus the fourth quarter and our Eagle Ford drill and complete cost has dropped another 10%. Given the commodity price downturn, our key goals at entering the year were to protect our balance sheet, hold our oil production for the year roughly flat with our 2015 exit rate, and maintain the flexibility to quickly ramp up our activity in production once the commodity price outlook warranted it. We remain on track to achieve these goals. Our 2016 drilling and completion capital expenditure guidance of $270 million to $290 million is unchanged, but due to further efficiencies and cost savings, we've been able to increase our planned activity levels in the Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin during the year. Based on the new plan, we no longer expect to draw down our inventory of Eagle Ford ducts drilled on completed wells during 2016 which should increase our operational flexibility to respond to further changes in the commodity price outlook. Although the incremental activity is not expected to have a material impact on 2016 production, we are raising the lower end of our 2016 crude oil production guidance by 100 barrels of oil per day following the strong first quarter production taking the range to 24,800 to 25,300 BOPD for the year. Our land CapEx guidance for the year rises to $20 million based on our outlook for additional bolt-on acquisitions. We also recently completed our semi-annual borrowing base redetermination. I'll let David Pitts discuss the details that fall in the redetermination. We continue to have significant capacity on our borrowing base, as well as the new covenant package that increases our flexibility in the event of an extended commodity price downturn. Now, I'll turn it over to David to talk about the quarter. David L. Pitts - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President Thanks, Chip, and good morning, everyone. As Chip mentioned, we had another quarter of record oil production at 25,806 barrels per day, 3% higher in the fourth quarter and 21% higher than the first quarter 2015. Gas production for the quarter was 70 MMcf per day, and NGL production was 4,547 barrels per day. First quarter production exceeded the high end of guidance primarily due to the continued strong performance of our Eagle Ford assets, higher than expected non-op production, and lower than expected levels of voluntary curtailments in the Marcellus. The first quarter included revenues of $81 million, of which $68 million was attributable to crude oil. During the quarter, we realized 86% of NYMEX for oil, 77% of NYMEX for gas, and 25% of NYMEX for NGLs, each of which exceeded the high end of our guided realizations. Total costs and expenses for the quarter were $39.9 million or $10.43 per Boe which was below our guidance, and down 3% from $10.74 per Boe in the prior quarter. We continue to see the positive impacts of our overhead expense reduction initiatives mentioned last quarter. For the first quarter, adjusted net income was $9.2 million or $0.16 per diluted share which exceeded consensus earnings estimates of $0.13 per diluted share. Drilling and completion capital expenditures for the quarter were $85 million, over 85% of which was in the Eagle Ford with the remainder weighted towards the Delaware Basin. Included in the press release is our second quarter and full year guidance. For the second quarter, we expect to realize 90% to 92% of NYMEX for oil, 60% to 65% of NYMEX for gas, and 20% to 25% of NYMEX for NGLs. DD&A guidance for the second quarter is now $14.25 to $15.25 per Boe. The decrease relative to the first quarter DD&A per Boe is primarily due to the ceiling test impairment recorded in the quarter. In the aggregate, guidance for second quarter costs and expenses reflect lower cost per unit than the guidance for the first quarter we provided in February. This quarter, we also added interest expense to our guidance table. We estimate that gross interest expense for the second quarter will be $24 million to $25 million with a split of $4 million to $5 million for interest capital loans, and $19 million to $21 million for net interest expense. Due to the positive impacts of our overhead expense reduction initiatives mentioned earlier, we have reduced our annual guidance for cash G&A to $41.5 million to $42 million which reflects a 19% reduction in our cash G&A from 2015. Currently have hedges in place for 55% of our estimated crude oil production for the balance of 2016. These consist of 9,750 barrels per day of swaps at $60 per barrel and 4,000 barrels per day of collars that have $50 floors and $76.50 ceilings. Additionally, we will receive $21 million of cash flows through the remainder of 2016 related to our prior hedge transactions. Based on crude oil strip prices as of yesterday, we expect to receive $26.5 million to $29.5 million from derivative settlements during the second quarter. For the first half of 2017, we currently have swaps covering 12,000 barrels of oil per day at $50 per barrel. We plan to be opportunistic about adding additional hedges for 2017 in order to protect our cash flows. Details regarding our derivative contracts are included in the press release. As Chip mentioned, we recently completed our spring borrowing base redetermination which resulted in a borrowing base of $600 million, down approximately 12% from the previous borrowing base of $685 million. In connection with this redetermination, we amended our revolver to replace our net-debt-to-EBITDA covenant with a secured-debt-to-EBITDA covenant that has a maximum ratio of 2 times. We also added an EBITDA-to-interest covenant with a minimum ratio of 2.5 times. Our new borrowing base and covenants provide us with ample liquidity in the current environment and increased flexibility in the event of an extended commodity price downturn. Further details regarding the amendment are included in the 8-K we filed this morning. I'll turn the call back over to Chip for an update on operations. Sylvester P. Johnson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director Thanks, David. In the Eagle Ford, we are producing from 280 gross or 247 net wells, with two drilling rigs running and one 24/7 frac crew. During the first quarter, we drilled 18 gross or 17.0 net operated wells, and completed 14 gross or 12.5 net wells. Crude oil production from the play was approximately 22,800 barrels a day for the quarter, an increase of approximately 2% versus the prior quarter. At the end of the quarter, we have 33 gross or 31.8 net operated Eagle Ford shale wells waiting on completion, equating to net crude oil production potential of more than 11,900 BOPD. We currently expect to drill approximately 57 gross or 53 net operated wells, and frac 55 gross or 52 net operated wells in the play during 2016. That is basically one less frac and eight more wells drilled in the Eagle Ford than we had guided to previously. The one less frac will be fracked in the Delaware Basin, adding to that frac count, and the drilling additions are due to the lower cost drilling Eagle Ford wells. Our focus on cost reductions and efficiency gains continued to bear fruit during the quarter, as we were able to lower our expected well costs in the Eagle Ford to $4.1 million from $4.6 million per well. This reduces our PV10 breakeven price in the core area of the play to approximately $32.50. Our downspacing tests in the Eagle Ford continue. We currently have three stagger-stack pilots on production that are testing the effective lateral spacing of 165 feet to 280 feet, and are currently fracking two additional pilots on a different acreage block. We estimate that a successful stagger-stack development could add approximately 220 to 880 net locations to our drilling inventory. In addition to organic inventory expansion, we have also been focused on expanding our acreage position. We recently added 4,000 net high-quality bolt-on acres to our position in the Eagle Ford. The new acreage is contiguous to our North LaSalle position, which has an estimated PV10 breakeven price of less than $35 a barrel. We estimate that the new acreage adds approximately 45 net drilling locations to our inventory, equating to a 5% to 10% increase in our core area inventory, and almost equaling our wells drilled in 2016. We were able to acquire the acreage in a creative manner, as we funded the acquisition through the sale of non-core exploration acreage. In the Delaware Basin, we completed our third operated well, the Liberator State 1H, during the quarter. The well was tested for 23 days before being shut in pending infrastructure and full restart of the Ramsey Gas Plant. The well tested at peak 24-hour rate of approximately 1,950 Boe per day prior to being shut in. Given the strong results from the Liberator State well, coupled with the Eagle Ford cost reductions, we have elected to increase our Delaware Basin activity during the year. We've added two additional wells to our 2016 drilling plans, with one of the wells expected to be drilled on recently acquired acreage that offsets the Liberator State well. We expect to spud this well later this quarter. This well will be the Corsair 3H and have an 8,300 foot lateral. In the Niobrara, we are producing from 123 gross or 53 net wells with 9 gross, 5.2 net wells waiting on completion at the end of the quarter, representing about 1,400 net BOPD of potential initial production. Given that our acreage in the play is primarily held by production, we're likely to limit spending in the Niobrara during 2016. Our current plan calls for the completion of several drilled but uncompleted wells later in the year, as well as some non-op activity. For the second quarter, total company oil production is expected to range between 23,600 and 24,000 net BOPD. For gas and NGLs, second quarter production should range between 56 and 60 net million cubic feet per day, and 3,700 and 3,900 net barrels per day, respectively. The sequential decline in production during the second quarter is consistent with the plan we laid out at the beginning of the year, and results from the planned shut in of a significant number of Eagle Ford wells due to offsetting completion activity, coupled with a limited number of wells brought online in the first quarter following the frac holiday in December. Additionally, since two of the pads we plan to complete are large, it results in an extended period of downtime for the neighboring wells. We expect the second quarter to be our low point for the year for oil production, and expect this to ramp into year-end, positioning us well to accelerate production growth in 2017 if we have an appropriate commodity price signal. Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann from SunTrust. Please proceed with your question. Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Morning, guys. Say, Chip, just maybe just two quick ones today. Just on sand concentration and all, I guess you were talking about efficiencies and all. Optimally you think you're at that, or does it – I guess, my questions is two questions there. One, what is that optimal amount and how does that vary by your areas? John Bradley Fisher - Chief Operating Officer & Vice President Hey, Neal. This is Brad Fisher. As far as sand concentration goes, we're pretty happy where we are right now in the Eagle Ford at around 1,500 to 1,600 pounds per foot. What we're working with right now is redistribution of that sand within our frac stages. Right now, we only put about 20% of our sand in our slick water portion of our frac which makes up about 60% of the total volume. We're looking at shifting a little more sand into slick water to try to create a bit more complexity there. Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Got it. And then just secondly, I went back, looking back at one of your older presentations Chip, where you talked about breakeven for some of the areas like your top areas like Gardendale, Brown Trust, RPG, et cetera. How much does that differ today versus, I think the last one I saw was maybe, I don't remember, a few months ago at least. I'm just wondering if you could give me an idea of some of those better, I think, breakevens you had at the time was as low as around $35 and with an average closer to about $39 or so. I'm wondering if that, given the well cost and the efficiencies, where that would be today. Sylvester P. Johnson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director We think it dropped $2 to $3 per barrel for the breakeven price in the entire core area. Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Brad Carpenter - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Hey guys good morning and congrats on the great quarter. I guess Chip, to start, the 4,000 acres in the Eagle Ford, that's a nice add given how tightly held everything is down there in the quality areas. Could you give us any details on how you came across this asset and if you're willing, the price that you paid for this acres? I didn't see anything in the release. Sylvester P. Johnson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director No, we've been trying to buy every good acre in the Eagle Ford for about two years. So we're aware of everything and every block that might be potentially an acquisition, so this is one we've been looking at for some time. It turned out that the seller wanted something we had so we were able to make a pretty creative deal that looked a lot like a trade. Brad Carpenter - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Okay. Great. So no real cash exchange? Brad Carpenter - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Okay. And then I guess a follow-up from a broader portfolio management perspective. You've discussed the possibility of selling your DJ assets in the past and yesterday we saw a fairly sizable package trade hands just to the west of you. Just curious if the valuation that you saw in that package changes your thoughts on the potential to move forward with a potential DJ sale of your own. Sylvester P. Johnson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director I guess what that transaction showed us is that we don't want to sell this asset too soon unless we have a great use of proceeds. And we've said that before. We don't want to sell assets at the bottom of the market unless we need the money to buy assets at the bottom of the market and we don't right now. So, we think that the Niobrara with the proven potential in multiple layers that is worth $14,000 per net undeveloped acre, which is what most people think Noble got for that deal, is a good number. And that's not even Noble's best acreage. If you look on their presentation, you'll see that East (17:48) is one of the areas they highlight and that's where we are and are partners with them. So, we have high hopes for the Niobrara. We don't want to sell it cheap. And so, we'll just hang onto it. Brad Carpenter - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Morning, guys. So, costs have come down pretty materially. You guys mentioned that the well costs in the Eagle Ford coming down a little bit and breakevens are now down a few bucks. Does that give you a better feeling about wanting to hedge out 2017 and maybe 2018 production at this stage? How are you guys thinking about that? Are you guys set with current levels of hedge protection? Sylvester P. Johnson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director Well, that's a good question, and we're going to discuss that at our board meeting in a couple weeks. We need to factor in the changes in our bank covenants now which are quite a bit different than these debt-to-EBITDA covenants we had before. We need to factor in these lower costs. The futures market is a little different than it was. So, basically, we've said we'll hedge about a year out, and so we'll be looking at third quarter 2017 hedges during the third quarter of 2016. So, we're pretty well hedged in the first half of 2017 and very well hedged this year. So, we're in good shape that way, but as far as how much we want to hedge in third quarter 2017, in a market that's running up like this, we haven't made that decision. And would you most likely go the swap route or would you guys look at some other type of option? Sylvester P. Johnson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director We'd look at collars. We haven't made that decision but the prices have rallied enough now that collars might make sense. At very low prices, they don't. At least not to us, and that's why we did swaps. But as prices rally and there's more excitement on the upside, then collars might make more sense. And then, one final one for me. If prices continue to stabilize or maybe even improve further from where they are, you guys add a rig, say, late this year early next year just theoretically. How quickly could we get first production on that first well that's drilled with that new rig after you guys ultimately say go? Just want to get a sense for how you guys would think about timing if you did intend to bring on some additional activity. Sylvester P. Johnson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director Well, what we've looked at is adding a frac crew instead of a drilling rig. Because if we add another frac crew in Eagle Ford, we can basically go for about six months with the inventory we have and the pace we're adding inventory with the two rigs we have that we don't have to add another rig for six to eight months. So, once we decide to grow, we can do that pretty quickly with a frac crew. We already have the inventory and the infrastructure, and so it would be very quick. We'd be adding production in a month. Brian Michael Corales - Scotia Howard Weil Good morning, guys. In the Eagle Ford, we saw a big drop in the cost on the wells. What was the major driver there? John Bradley Fisher - Chief Operating Officer & Vice President Hi, Brian. This is Brad Fisher. The last time we really gave an update on our well cost was back in November. Since that time, with the kind of gen 3 rigs that we've got, with better motor runs, better bit motor pairing, and the fact that we have to do a lot less steering on our wells now, because we've drilled wells across all our acreage. So now, we're point-to-point drilling rather than doing so much steering. We've cut two days off of our average well out there. Between that and a significant decrease in the amount of dollars we're spending on casing. Casing costs have come down a lot. Since that time, we've received an additional discount on our fracs. And we're playing around with our frac chemicals a little bit, and coil tubing drill outs are down significantly. So, when I add all those together, I come up with about $500,000 in savings, and that's the driver to go from $4.6 million to $4.1 million. Brian Michael Corales - Scotia Howard Weil Okay. And then, switching to Delaware, I think you all have two more completions to do this year. What is the timing for that? Sylvester P. Johnson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director Brian Michael Corales - Scotia Howard Weil Andrew R. Agosto - Vice President-Business Development Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to follow up on the question just a moment ago about how you'd reaccelerate when oil prices hit that magic number. Does six months, you talked about, of inventory, does that bring you down, draw down all the ducts to zero, or does the six months still keep you at a normalized kind of run rate level of uncompleted wells? Sylvester P. Johnson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director No, I think by my math, after six months, we still have 17 ducts, and after nine months with normal drilling, we'd have seven. So, we have a lot of flexibility in that regard. Okay. That's helpful. And two-thirds of the – rule of thumb, people usually say two-thirds of the well cost is completions. How should we think about funding that acceleration, or we allow just rising cash flows to help give you the incremental spend? Sylvester P. Johnson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director I think everything we do would be based on rising cash flows under any sort of normal price signal, because if we had a giant price signal, might stretch into the revolver to ramp up faster. But that's not what we're anticipating. That's really helpful. And then, just last one for me. The Eagle Ford oil mix dropped a few percentage points sequentially. Was there anything noisy that happened over the quarter? Is the 73%, 74% a good run rate we should think about from here? Andrew R. Agosto - Vice President-Business Development This Andy Agosto. If you look back at our GOR in the Eagle Ford, it bobbles around, depending upon where we're completing wells primarily. We did bring on a number of wells in some areas that had a little bit higher GOR. That was probably the single biggest reason, but no, there's nothing fundamental going on that's going to change the oil gas mix. Jeff P. Hayden - Vice President-Investor Relations Hey, John. It's Jeff. I think something else which is influencing it a little recently is the difference between produced volumes and sold volumes. I think our flaring probably went down a little bit, so we're actually selling some additional gas in some areas, some things like that. So historically, if you look at it, that percentage has bounced between 74% to 78%. And it can be influenced quarter to quarter, based on the things we've talked about. And the next question comes from the line of Jeff Grampp with Northland Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Jeff S. Grampp - Northland Securities, Inc. Good morning, guys. Question on the stagger stack, and I understand it's maybe a little bit premature to comment on results of the producing pads, but it looked like you guys are bringing a couple more test pads online here. Just wondering, if you're doing anything different on the completion of these upcoming based on some of the results that you've seen to-date or are these just another data point in another area? I guess, just trying to get a sense for the strategic significance of the additional stagger stacks versus the ones you already got online. Andrew R. Agosto - Vice President-Business Development Yeah. This is Andy again. The latter point is spot on. I mean, these would be tests, similar spacing configurations but in different geographic area. Jeff S. Grampp - Northland Securities, Inc. Okay. Completion wise, though, you guys are sticking with the same recipe that you use on the initial stagger stack? Andrew R. Agosto - Vice President-Business Development Well, I think on the completion side, as Brad mentioned earlier, we're going to be experimenting with some different things, particularly with respect to sand concentrations in the slick water stage, or portion of the jobs. But, no, we're not going to make a significant deviation on completion technique so we can compare the results fairly with the prior well that we've drilled in the area. Jeff S. Grampp - Northland Securities, Inc. Got it. Okay. And then, back on the well cost front. Do you guys kind of have an updated estimate on, of the cost reductions, if we go back to kind of peak in 2014 to where you're at today, estimate on what's internal efficiencies that are more sticky versus just kind of help from the service guys? And the next question comes from the line of... Sylvester P. Johnson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director Sorry, Jeff. We were having a little discussion on your question. Yes. Honestly, most of what we're seeing from what we're calling our base case back in when oil was $90 to $100 versus where we would end up if oil reversed course and went back to $100. I would say 80% of that is going to be from discounts from the service companies and about 20% of that is going to be from efficiencies that we've gained over that timeframe. And the next question comes from the line of Ron Mills with Johnson Rice. Please proceed with your question. Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC Good morning. Maybe just one quick follow-up on Jeff's question. You look at the stagger stacks between the three current pilots and the two that you're completing. Are they fairly well spread across your Eagle Ford position or are they fairly concentrated? Just trying to get a sense as to how much of that inventory increase can be figured out through these first few pilots. Andrew R. Agosto - Vice President-Business Development Well, the – this is Andy again. The pilots, the three pilots we have producing and the two additional would be focused in an area that represents 75% to 80% of our future locations. So we think the results are going to be representative for a very large portion of this portfolio. Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC Okay, great. And then, I know you're testing between 165-foot and 280-foot spacing on these first pilots, is part of that driven by – I know in your current inventory, you have some at 330-foot spacing and some at 500-foot spacing. Are the tighter spacing on the stagger stacks in areas where you're already drilling on tighter or how were those designed? Andrew R. Agosto - Vice President-Business Development Everything we're doing, we're testing now is in areas that we would otherwise be drilling at 330-foot spacing in the lower part of the lower Eagle Ford. Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC Okay. And then, Chip or maybe Andy again, but on the second quarter production levels, I'm assuming most of those offsetting completion operations are going to be in the Eagle Ford. Are those pretty weighted throughout the quarter? Or from a timing of getting that production ramp back up, is it something that we should expect for the full third quarter? Jeff P. Hayden - Vice President-Investor Relations Hey, Ron it's Jeff. I mean all of that activity is in the Eagle Ford. Jeff P. Hayden - Vice President-Investor Relations I mean, that's where the majority of production is, so that's where the major completion activity is going to be in the quarter. So these are big pads we're taking offline when we're having to frac some of these wells. So, we simply shut the pads in, the offsetting pads in a few weeks before we do a completion so they can be offline for an extended period of time. So, that's a lot of volume that we're just not going to have during Q2. So, once those completions are done, we bring all that stuff back on, so you should definitely see an increase in Q3 just because we won't have that same level of downtime. Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC Okay. Great. And then, maybe one bigger-picture question. We asked earlier about how long it would take for you to get some production to respond. And if you float that across to the industry, if oil prices rebounded and people started increasing activity, Chip, any color you might have on how long you think it might take industry supply to start to reverse from this decline that we've been in here for a couple months? Sylvester P. Johnson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director Well, I think in general, it'll take longer than it's going to take us because we have the ducts and the infrastructure and we're sitting in the middle of the Eagle Ford which is – there's a lot of service company equipment there already. I think in some of the other plays, it's going to take longer to get the equipment. It's going to take longer to get the crews put together. A lot of the service company personnel has left the industry. And it could take longer than we anticipate, I think, for industry to add a lot of rigs and frac crews and start get production back up. So, I don't see how it happens in less than six months for most companies. Jeff P. Hayden - Vice President-Investor Relations Hey, Ron. It's Jeff again. One other thing I'll add to that that's maybe a little different for us versus some of the other guys in the industry is I mean we still have some slack in the system on the completion side. I mean, our current plans still assume the pretty significant frac holiday later in the year. So, we could increase our completion activity without having to add any additional crews, any additional people. And I think that's where one of your big bottlenecks is going to be. So, I don't know if everybody can do that, but I think that's one of the reasons why we might be able to bring on additional production maybe sooner than some others once we make the decision to increase activity. Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC And our next question comes from the line of Marshall Carver with Heikkinen Energy. Please proceed with your question. Marshall Hampton Carver - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC Yes. Good morning. So, in your press release, you mentioned that early results from the down spacing in the Eagle Ford are in line with your expectation. What was your expectation? What's your expectation, to have some communication or no communication, or can you give any (34:25)? Sylvester P. Johnson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director Well, our expectation is, it will – what we used as a threshold is that we need at least six months of non-interference for the economics to work. And so that's what we're looking for. Someday there will be interference. There has to be. But the math works on the economics, if you can get six months of non-interference. Marshall Hampton Carver - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC And how many months in are you on the longest ones? Sylvester P. Johnson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director The longest one is right at six months. The next two are at four to five months. And then the next two are fracking now. Marshall Hampton Carver - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC Okay. And you haven't seen any interference yet? Sylvester P. Johnson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director We're meeting expectations. We haven't seen anything negative. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Stevens with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question. Chris S. Stevens - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Hey. Morning, guys. Just wanted to touch on M&A again, if I could. If you could talk about maybe whether you think there might be some opportunity to make a little bit more of a significant acquisition at some point in the Eagle Ford, especially as some other operators seem to be de-emphasizing their plans out there? Or do you think, going forward, it's going to be more of the type of bolt-on acquisitions you did this quarter? Sylvester P. Johnson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director Well, we'll always be trying to do the bolt-on deals, but we are trying to do a bigger deal at the same time. So, we're talking to just about everybody in the play. There have been some sales packages on the market lately that are finally starting to have some quality assets in them. Usually the whole package is not quality, but at least there are some in there. So, we're looking at those kind of packages. We'd like to do something bigger than 4,000 acres per quarter. But if that's what we do, that's still – that's a great addition. Chris S. Stevens - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Got it. Yeah. And then, what about over on the Delaware Basin side? I mean, would you do something bigger over there, in a more de-risked area of the play? Sylvester P. Johnson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director We have tried in the Delaware Basin, have been out bid significantly. So, I think the competition over there is worse than it is in the Eagle Ford, probably because there are so many smaller companies in the Delaware that are selling things, and so many more PE-backed shops that are trying to buy things. Chris S. Stevens - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Okay. Understood. And I guess, what are the recent AFEs out there in the Delaware Basin that you're getting on these upcoming wells? And are you going to try anything different, between either the completion design or different zones or anything like that? John Bradley Fisher - Chief Operating Officer & Vice President Hey Chris, this is Brad Fisher. Right now, we're expecting our well cost, depending on the actual casing program that we run, and it varies across our acreage a bit. Anywhere from probably about $7.3 million to $7.8 million, drilled and completed. As far as trying different completion techniques, right now, we're fracking with an Eagle Ford-like frac out there, a little heavier on the slick water, but higher sand concentration. More in the range of 2,000 pounds per foot. We are varying our landing points in the various wells, depending on what we see in the offsets, and what the pilot holes look like. So, we have several different tests going out there for different intervals. So, it's not been consistent across the play at this point. And our next question comes from Brian Velie from Capital One Securities. Please proceed with your question. Brian Taylor Velie - Capital One Securities, Inc. Good morning, guys. Most of my questions have been answered, but I just wanted to follow on on the bolt-on acquisition real quick. The increase, or the tick higher in CapEx for land this year, from $15 million to $20 million, despite the fact that you almost traded for the acreage you picked up this quarter. Should we think of that as more bolt-on size stuff becoming available? I know you've been on the hunt there for a long time. Is it finally starting to free up at least in that kind of scale package wise? Sylvester P. Johnson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director Yeah, that's what's driving that increase, is we were able to make some smaller acquisitions, 640-acre to 1,280-acre deals in the Permian and we also have a couple of smaller deals in the Eagle Ford right now that are in the 1,000-acre to 2,000-acre category. So we just have more of them that we're confident we're going to be able to close. Brian Taylor Velie - Capital One Securities, Inc. Sylvester P. Johnson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director If there are no more questions, we'll move on then. Thanks again to the Carrizo team for an outstanding quarter. It's always great to set records on oil production and Boe per day. Going forward, we're very excited about the stagger-stack testing and the fact that we are close to the finish line, I think, on two or three pilots. And that could change our drilling inventory significantly and the way we go about our operations. The Delaware Basin results on the Liberator and now on the well we're drilling, the Corsair should be very exciting, and that could help us to determine our capital levels in future years as we try to add more acreage. So, it was a very good quarter. We're looking forward to the results of this quarter, and we'll be back in 90 days. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Have a great day. Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.
