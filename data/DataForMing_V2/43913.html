Apple fan-boys have proclaimed the Apple Watch a screaming success as Tim Cook explained he was "generally happy" with the launch. The big driver of the impression of awesomeness was how hard it was to get one... i.e. so much demand that supply copuld not keep up. However, as The Wall Street Journal reports, it was not demand, it was instead defects that forced the company to limit supply. Apple Inc. is said to have found a defect in a key component of its watch during production, forcing the company to limit supply of the new device,. As The Wall Street Journal reports , A key component of the Apple Watch made by one of two suppliers was found to be defective, prompting Apple Inc. to limit the availability of the highly anticipated new product, according to people familiar with the matter. The part involved is the so-called taptic engine, designed by Apple to produce the sensation of being tapped on the wrist. After mass production began in February, reliability testing revealed that some taptic engines supplied by AAC Technologies Holdings Inc., of Shenzhen, China, started to break down over time, the people familiar with the matter said. One of those people said Apple scrapped some completed watches as a result. Apple last week told some watch suppliers to slow production until June, without explaining why, according to people familiar with Appleâ€™s supply chain. Suppliers were surprised because Apple recently said that Watch inventory was insufficient, these people said. On Monday, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said â€œdemand is greater than supplyâ€? for the Watch, but didnâ€™t disclose sales or orders. In a memo to retail-store employees earlier this month, Apple retail chief Angela Ahrendts said stores wonâ€™t get watches to sell until the end of May because of â€œhigh global interest combined with our initial supply.â€? New online orders will be delivered in June, Apple says on its website.

Sounds like I'm in the markit for a watch, but since supplies are low, I'm sitting on the sidelines with all my cash just waiting for the right time. Wed, 04/29/2015 - 17:27 | 6044370 AIIB Everybody that bought one 'accidentally' dropped it on the ground & smashed it. Demand doubled. Paul Krugman is the toast of the town!

Wed, 04/29/2015 - 16:57 | 6044230 Mister Delicious I'm a fan boy who watched ZH be wrong over and over as to apple - and seems to have a real hard on against it. Which I just don't get - all of a sudden a giant corporation figuring out how to avoid Americna corporate taxes is bad?  Are they the only company building their shit in China? Tell you what, the "fanboy" arguments stopped being interesting 3 years ago. ...ahem.  The watch will be okay because the American people are well trained to spend money they dont have on shit they dont need.  The watch will be like really nice sneakers for white people. I'll be waiting for a price drop and second gen.  A hologram for my porn would also be desirable - no way I can look at porn on a screen that size, even when I got a chubbly going. Wed, 04/29/2015 - 17:02 | 6044258 i_call_you_my_base Whether the watch is a good idea has nothing to do with apple. I use mostly all apple products, and like apple, but still think it's a shitty idea and it won't sell.

If 5% of the people who worship APPLE would instead  go inwardly and figure out why the world is corrupt---and resolve to correct it, the problems of injustice, violence, inequality, etc., would be eliminated.
