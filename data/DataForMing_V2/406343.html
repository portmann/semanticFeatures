Bookmark Post Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Comments making a rival google competition rival Echo amazon Alexa The Amazon Echo can do just about everything â€” order pizza , pay your credit card bill , and answer all your spur-of-the-moment questions, among other things â€” but can it compete with other connected home speakers? Thatâ€™s something Google is poised to find out with its own connected-device that could launch later this year. Re/code reports that Google is working on a hardware device â€” internally known as â€œChirpâ€? (possibly a reference to Google’s Nest line of connected home products) â€” that would integrate the companyâ€™s search and voice assistant technology, rivaling the Amazon Echo and its voice assistant Alexa. The device, which Google declined to comment on, is said to resemble the tech giantâ€™s OnHub wireless router and would likely use the preferred command â€œOkay, Googleâ€? already in use in the companyâ€™s Android phones. While Re/code reports that the new device probably wonâ€™t be unveiled at Googleâ€™s I/O conference next week, but is expected to debut at some point this year.
