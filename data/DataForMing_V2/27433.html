Will Europe And South America Hinder Ford's Growth? - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford's stock has been trading near the same levels for two years. Europe and South America have been troubled regions for the company for the last few years. Ford Motor Co. (NYSE: F ) is at a very interesting point in the company's history. Having been around since the early 1900s, Ford has established itself as a major automobile manufacturer domestically, with its blue oval being a recognizable emblem abroad as well. The last 7 years have been unique and impactful in several ways for Ford; it's fair to say the company will never be the same. F refused to accept a government bailout during the Great Recession, setting itself apart from domestic counterparts General Motors (NYSE: GM ) and Chrysler (NYSE: FCAU ). Ford's ingenuity didn't stop there as legendary former CEO Alan Mulally pioneered the ONE Ford strategy in order to lift the stock from its lows barely over $1/share in the midst of the recession. Ford's stock has several tailwinds in the coming years but has been range-bound, unable to breach its 52-week high of $18.12. Shares are currently hovering around $16 right now, the same price they were trading at in July of 2013. Initially there were many critics of Ford's initiative, claiming ONE Ford wouldn't work for a variety of reasons. Doubts included the chance new models did not appeal to consumers, the inability to turn a profit in Europe and South America, difficulty of maintaining market share domestically, and the inevitable departure of Mulally. Since July of 2013, all of those concerns have been alleviated with the exception of those regarding Europe and South America. The sentiment toward the company is becoming more positive with the average consensus of "Buy" among analysts according to NASDAQ. Except for one analyst, each professional covering the stock believes it is at least worth holding. Of the headwinds facing the company, it's performance in the two markets mentioned above is the most predominant. It has contributed to shares remaining around the $16 level for the last two years, but the crucial factor is whether Ford will be able to make those regions profitable in the coming years. Europe has been a talking point for Ford investors for years. Performance in the continent has served as a measure of Ford's recovery. Ford had been targeting 2014 as the year the company earns a profit in Europe, but that guidance was cut late last year as the new target for European profit was pushed back. Additionally, Ford slashed its long term profit forecast for the region from $0.06-$0.08/share to $0.03-$0.05/share by 2020; the stock fell about 18% in the following weeks. Many Ford investors are focused on the future so this news was very discouraging to the market. F's First Quarter Earnings Report revealed that 2015 won't be the year the company completely turns things around in Europe either. In fact, Ford increased the projected loss upwards of the previously forecasted $250 million; the company added that the loss will be less than the $1 billion loss in 2014. Russia is a major contributor to the negative performance in Europe, with sales down 71% YTD . Initially, Europe was viewed by many as a region that will take time to turn around, but will be a significant contributor to F's bottom line. As time passes it seems more like a venture where something always goes wrong, limiting upside potential. Ford's European operations have reached the point where investors need to decide whether believing in the turnaround is an exercise of shrewd patience or misguided confidence with a hint of naiveté. To find an answer to that question, one needs to define what "believing" in the turnaround entails. Expecting Ford Europe to be a major profit driver anytime in the next five years would certainly fall under the naive category. Given the company guided for a $0.03-$0.05/share profit five years from now, it's reasonable to consider the turnaround complete when the company breaks even in the region. While this may be underwhelming criteria for a turnaround, it needs to be remembered that we're talking about a region that has never added that much profit to Ford's earnings. With record-setting sales in North America and Asia, Ford shareholders should be satisfied with breaking even in Europe. As long as the troubled region isn't taking from earnings, it should be viewed as a "win". Any profit in Europe is an added bonus. To put it simply, yes, Europe will hinder Ford's growth but only if you're expecting large profits in the future. For those with a more pessimistic view on Europe like myself, it's not viewed as a hindrance because there is little expectation. Currency headwinds along with economic instability have cursed Ford's earnings in South America for the last few quarters and the outlook is uncertain. The strengthening US Dollar has increased the impact of already existent foreign exchange expenses. Full year profit (loss) in South America was $213 million in 2012, then fell to ($34 million) in 2013. While no company wants to see a drop in profit, the decline from 2012 to 2013 is nothing compared to massive loss of $1.16 billion South America brought Ford in 2014. Similarly to Europe, there are two major areas of concern for Ford in South America: company-specific operations/risks and broader economy-based risk. The following slide from Ford's 2014 Fiscal Year Investor Presentation contains information relevant to both categories. The 13% decline in the SAAR for the region is troubling from a macro perspective as it hints vehicle purchases are declining. IMO the more significant data is the market share statistics. Vehicle sales will pick up with the broader economy. Ford increased its market share for the entire region by 90 bps and 70 bps in the continent's largest market, Brazil. The Brazilian auto market comprised just under 68% of all vehicle sales in South America last quarter. While the SAAR fell 13%, Ford's revenue only dropped 7%. These statistics indicate that Ford's operational risk in South America is relatively low since F products are resonating well with consumers. The new product offerings will continue to prove successful and increase the company's market share in years to come. Still, the massive loss incurred in South America in 2014 needs to be addressed, especially given the massive acceleration in losses y-o-y. A large detractor from F's bottom line has been foreign exchange charges. In the second half of 2014, Ford lost $436 million purely due to currency exchanges in South America. These charges will most likely continue in the region but at a much lower level. The massive loss seen in the third and fourth quarter directly coincide with the US Dollar's surge in value. Overall, I see South America being a strong profit driver for Ford long term. Management also guided 2015 to be "substantial improvement" over 2014 in South America. Europe and South America often get mentioned in the same breath with regard to Ford but are actually two entirely different scenarios for the company. Europe is a perpetually troubled region for Ford that investors shouldn't be focusing too much on. Europe will return to the break-even point by 2017 at the latest and will then add small profits to F's bottom line. South America will be similar to Europe's profit/loss in the next few years then add significant profit in later years. Once economic stability (or at least some) is achieved in the region, the profits will flow in for Ford. I don't see Europe adding much value for the company, but contrary to popular opinion, I think South America will be a very profitable region for Ford going forward.
