How Apple Can Reap New Revenues From Murdering Mobile Data Plans - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha The growth of ad-blocking is accelerating at an enormous rate. Almost all ad-blocking is currently done with desktop computers even though mobile views are now 38% of web browsing. Apple has multiple opportunities to make new revenue streams. My preferred option is eventually phasing out other ad-blockers and providing a subscription option to a â€œFastâ€? version of Safari. Since Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) enabled ad-blocking software with their latest mobile operating system, there has been an increasing level of concern and debate about the future of the online advertising industry. The extension of ad-blocking to popular mobile devices could be the harbinger of enormous change in the way online content is created and managed. While Apple is currently allowing individual content producers to build ad-blocking software, I expect Apple to become professionally involved in the future because they are capable of generating significant revenues from being the arbitrator of which advertisements will be delivered to consumers. The use of ad-blocking software on mobile devices will be a welcome change for many consumers and may rapidly expand the use of these ad-blockers. However, there is a very material difference in the way my desktop computer and my iPhone operate. My desktop machine is designed to do what I tell it to do; my mobile device is designed to do what Apple will permit me to do. There is an enormous difference in the functionality of the devices. I see my desktop as being a real tool and the phone as being a toy. If I am trying to accomplish something important, I want the desktop. My ad-blocking software on the desktop would be replaced immediately if it stopped working. On the other hand, Apple could easily disable existing applications and replace them with their own version. The impact here is enormous because Apple would have the ability to monopolize ad-blocking on their devices. Currently the use of ad-blocking software on mobile devices is very limited, as demonstrated below: When Apple makes the leap to kick out independent developers and take over the industry of blocking ads, they will have an incredibly powerful tool. In a quick update Apple could enable ad-blocking software across most of their devices. Turning ad-blocking on by default would ensure immediate market saturation. When Apple decides to take that leap, they can immediately extract a pound of flesh from every advertiser trying to run ads on sites that are frequently viewed by mobile devices. Advertisers that refuse to pay Apple will effectively be forced to close up shop. If you wonder how this kind of sudden power in the business relationship shakes out, look at the suppliers that built up scale to supply Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ). When Wal-Mart decided that the price would be lower, those suppliers could either accept the reduction in price or go out of business because they couldn't cover their fixed costs due to the expansions that were necessary to satisfy the demand. In a similar manner, Apple will have exclusive control over access to an extremely large portion of the mobile market. When Apple demands large amounts of money from advertisers, it will mean less revenue available for the original content creator. The advertisers will need to offload costs somewhere and one predictable consequence will be lower payouts to the websites that produce content and bring viewers within range of the ads. When revenue to content producers declines, quality will decline with it. If you want to see what I mean, simply turn on the radio and see what passes for music. As it stands there are already a substantial number of sites dedicated to nothing but producing extremely low-cost content. This content is regularly tagged with "click bait" titles and often reproduced across several sites. Apple also has the option to go directly to consumers. Apple can simply offer a "Fast" and "Slow" version of their browser. The slow one would load all or most of the advertisements. The fast one would not allow any advertisements. Make both free for a few months so consumers become attracted to the benefits, and then hit it with a $5/month subscription. How much faster does it go? Betanews did some testing on loading websites with and without using "Crystal", one of the ad-blockers. If you don't think consumers will pay it, perhaps you should consider how much they are currently paying for cell phone service. Blocking the ads on a mobile browser significantly reduces bandwidth usage which means many customers would be able to save more than $5/month on their data plan in addition to having materially faster browsing. That is a very potent offer. Because mobile browsing makes bandwidth usage a commodity, the wide spread use of ad-blocking software would significantly decrease data usage. That would be a large blow to networks such as Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) and AT&T (NYSE: T ). How much bandwidth do those advertisements take up? It turns out the answer is "often more than the rest of the web page". While I am a cynic by nature and highly doubt that the best possible scenarios will emerge, there is one situation that would be ideal. The problem with advertising is not that advertising is inherently useless. It is that advertising is often poorly targeted. Advertisers have attempted to deal with that by data mining and in the process created huge breaches of consumer trust. There are two possible ways that advertising could be made dramatically better. Option 1: Real Customization to Content I frequently cover ETFs and a large number of the ETFs I cover would be free to trade with the right brokerage. In some cases that is Schwab and in others it is TD Ameritrade. Rather than simply having a banner, they could content match the ticker of the article and advertise simply that this ticker is "free to trade" for their clients. In that manner readers would see advertising that was providing information that was actually useful and relevant to the very ETF they were learning about. Advertising like that deserves to be shown to consumers because it is useful. I despise data mining without real genuine consent. Using a site and thus automatically agreeing to their terms of service and therefore being treated as having given consent is not real consent. Apple could encourage users to voluntarily provide data about themselves in exchange for a "Medium" speed version of the browser that would block the majority of advertisements. If Apple was keeping my information in confidence but only showing the ads that I had told them were relevant, that would be an acceptable middle ground. Allow me to provide an example. When I receive advertisements, a substantial portion of them are for new cars. Perhaps they advertise to me based simply on my address, or on my gender and age. Regardless, it is completely and utterly useless. I don't expect to buy another vehicle within the next four years. If I did buy a vehicle, it will be a Toyota (NYSE: TM ) and it will be private party rather than through the dealership. I have two Toyotas in my garage right now. Each time an advertiser pays money to reach me on the topic, they have wasted their money. I'm fairly set that I would want my next vehicle to be a Toyota Tacoma. Is it because I like photos like this? No, it is because I have a Toyota Tacoma and I like it. Why did I pick a Tacoma? I went two mechanics I trusted and asked them each what I should buy for my needs at the time. Each told me to look for a Tacoma. I like eating at local independent restaurants. I would be very interested in advertisements about those kinds of restaurants. When I became unsatisfied with using USAA as my personal brokerage, I spent several days researching brokerage companies. That would've been a great time to advertise to me. I'm actively looking for a great painter to paint my house and looking to finish my basement, can you guess how often I've had advertisements for those services? (Hint: The number is zero.) Every analyst talks about how Apple is attacking Google's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) main revenue source, but this is not a direct attack. There may be some very material collateral damage, but not an intentional attack. Apple is opening up the opportunity to generate substantial new revenue streams from either making advertisers pay to get through or providing users with a cheap subscription offer that would cost less than the savings on many data plans. It might even possible to do both. If Apple offered to hold your information confidentially and prescreen advertisements, would you allow the ones that met your interests to come through? If they offered you two icons on your phone, one for a fast web with ad-blocking and one for a slower web without it, would you use the slow one to avoid paying a small subscription fee? If you found that you regularly used substantially less data than you had purchased due to the new ad-blocking feature, would you look to reduce the monthly cell phone bill?
