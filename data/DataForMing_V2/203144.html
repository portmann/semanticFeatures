Is InvenSense Really Worth Less Than $1 Billion? - InvenSense (NYSE:INVN) | Seeking Alpha Stone Fox Capital , Stone Fox Capital (1,598 clicks) InvenSense now trades for less than $1 billion despite solid growth prospects in IoT and wearables. Margin pressures due to the largest customer growing share has the market overly focused on short-term issues. The stock is one of the best values in the market and shouldn't trade anywhere close to the current price of $10. With a margin-focused investor community, the recent quarterly results for InvenSense (NYSE: INVN ) provided limited hope. The company suggested a further shift in revenues towards the largest customer that has huge volume discounts. The stock plunged to near all-time lows just as revenue surges to all-time highs. One has to wonder if confluence of these market forces hasn't provided an extremely great time to own the stock. Is $10 again a great buying opportunity? The FQ1 news on margins were mixed, but the market continues to overly obsess on short-term numbers. The data points unfortunately suggest a further shift toward Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) products in the short term due to a move by Samsung ( OTCPK:SSNF ) toward a multi-source approach. While that margins for Samsung are lower than the general customer, the numbers suggest that Apple has the lowest prices. For FQ1, Apple jumped to 38% of revenue, up from 32% in the previous quarter. Samsung dropped to only 23% of revenue, down from 29%. Prior to Apple, Samsung was regularly a 30% plus customer. Samsung has dropped to the point that Korea only hit 27% of sales and China is quickly approaching that total at 23%. China jumped from only 18% in the prior quarter. This shift towards China is also adding angst with the investment community due to the concerns over that economy slowing down though the recent news from Apple and Avago Tech (NYSE: AVG ) suggest otherwise. As it relates to Apple, one needs to keep in mind that the company only started with some of the iPhones and possibly just the iPhone 6. As the next product comes out and the original iPhone 6 moves to the cheaper phone versions, InvenSense grabs more market share. Hence, a shift up in Apple contributes to lower gross margins. As pointed out before, the market is generally missing that the issues in the past was more operating expense related. A downshift in the quarter led to operating expenses actually declining sequentially by $160,000. Not a huge amount, but it is rare to see in the technology sector where a company produces $7 million revenue growth and produces a cost reduction. The company now projects that the technology platform is built so the investment phase for InvenSense is over. The real driver to stock valuation is the new IoT category that includes games, drones, and wearables. The category contributed 12% of revenues for the quarter, up one percentage point sequentially. At this percentage grows over the next couple of years, the undue influence of Apple will decline allowing margins to rise. This brings us to the stock valuation depression. At $10, the market valuation was only $920 million. With a strong cash flow profile now, the market is baking in some dire projections to value the stock at only 13.5x forward earnings and trading at only 2x revenues. The market places some extremely low multiples on the stock on the basis that the low margins from Apple will persist into infinity. Compared to Ambarella (NASDAQ: AMBA ) that focused on equally hot areas in high-compressed video for the IoT and drones market has a PS multiple nearly 5x that of InvenSense. Even Avago Tech and NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ: NXPI ) that have solid growth profiles though not spectacular trade at much higher multiples. The reality is that InvenSense will continue facing margin and pricing issues until the market develops beyond the two dominant smartphone providers. At the same time, STMicroelectronics (NYSE: STM ) will attempt to take market share by undercutting on price that is ultimately doomed to fail, but it can impact revenues in the short term. InvenSense remains one of the cheapest stocks in the semiconductor space based on growth prospects and valuation. The stock shouldn't trade for less than $1 billion with revenue growing nearly 20% to reach nearly $450 million this year.
