Here's Where The Value Is; More Than 5 Attractively Priced, High Quality DGI Stocks | Seeking Alpha Even though most agree that DGI stock valuations are stretched, as Mike Nadel's recent panel revealed, there are still some attractively priced, high quality DGI stocks available. As a participant on Mike's panel, I selected three DGI stocks – AAPL, SEP, and UTX – that deserve due diligence for many DGI portfolios. I discuss more details here. In doing the research for Mike's article, I discovered two more stocks – CAH and OHI - that may look tempting, depending on your portfolio's needs. Bonus! There are four additional stocks that you may want to consider for your due diligence – HCP, GILD, CCP, and UNP. I hope this article sparks some ideas for your portfolio; I would love to hear about the DGI stocks that you think are well-priced right now! As many of you know, Mike Nadel recently assembled a Seeking Alpha panel to answer the question: What three high-quality companies would you recommend to a value-conscious Dividend Growth investor right now? Talk about looking for a needle in a haystack! There's no question that in today's market, it is more difficult to find high-quality, decent-yielding DGI stocks trading at or below fair value. The higher the yield an investor requires, the tougher it gets. So, it should come as no surprise that many of us on the panel voiced our concerns that valuations of most DGI stocks are currently s-t-r-e-t-c-h-e-d! Even so, I believe that there are still some quality DGI values to be had. Yes, even today! In this article, I'll discuss my thinking behind the three stocks that I selected as part of Mike's panel. Plus, I'll add my thoughts on two others. And, here's a bonus! I'll throw out four more names for your consideration. For a full read-out of Mike's SA panel findings, please see his articles: This Bull's Getting Old, So Where is the value? Part 1 and This Bull's Getting Old, so, where is the Value? Part 2 . To preface my choices, I define high quality DGI stocks as those having: Solid financial strength - I require an S&P credit rating of at least BBB or better and a debt-to-total capital ratio of less than 50%. A consistent track record of growing dividends - I prefer 10 years of dividend growth, but I will consider relatively new DGI stocks with shorter records. In addition, I look for an historical 5-year dividend compound annual growth rate (i.e., CAGR) of at least 4%. The ability to continue to grow the dividend in the future - I look for a forecast 3-year dividend CAGR of at least 4% and a dividend payout ratio of less than 80%. In terms of value, I look for the following: Is the stock trading at or below its historical 10-year P/E? Is the stock's dividend yield at or near its 5-year high? Is the stock trading at or below Morningstar's fair value estimate? S&P's fair value estimate? Valuentum's fair value estimate? Is the stock trading below S&P's 12-month target? My Top Three Attractively Priced, High Quality DGI Stocks In this section, I discuss the logic behind the three choices included in Mike's articles. Here are my top three DGI stock picks that I feel are selling at attractive prices right now! 1. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) - With its S&P credit rating of AA+ and its debt-to-capital ratio of 32%, there is no question that Apple is currently in excellent financial health. Given its strong balance sheet, impressive cash flow generation and low payout ratio of 25%, AAPL can certainly afford to pay a healthy dividend for a very long time. Looking into the future, AAPL's dividend growth rate is estimated to be in the double digits (from 10% to 15%) for the next three years. The downside? At 2.4%, Apple's dividend yield is too low for many retiree portfolios and its dividend growth track record is too short (only 5 years). Apple's commitment to its dividend hasn't yet been proven against the faddish nature of its consumer discretionary business. As a result, I don't think that Apple is a fit for every DGI portfolio. It's not in mine. But, I did buy it for my millennial daughter's. Why? Because Apple is suitable for investors looking for "growthier" DGI stocks - as long as they are willing to take the risk that Apple's cult following will continue. For those looking for a bargain and believe in Apple's story, it's on sale! Selling at its lowest price in the last two years, AAPL's stock price is lower than Morningstar's, S&P's and Valuentum's fair value estimates as well as S&P's 12-month target. Furthermore, at its current P/E of 10.9, Apple's P/E is lower than it has been in the last 18 years. I selected Apple as my #1 choice because it is a solid company that could reach dividend champion status while providing strong dividend growth along the way. But, it is only for those who believe in its story. 2. Spectra Energy Partners (NYSE: SEP ) - SEP is a master limited partnership in the energy sector. We own it in the Dividend House portfolio. For those underweight in energy and feel that oil has bounced off the bottom, SEP may be an attractive option. Why? SEP has 10 years of distribution growth under its belt, a BBB credit rating, a low 32% debt-to-capital, and a low 50% payout ratio. But, the big reason to own SEP is for the income. And, talk about income! Looking forward, analysts project that SEP will continue to grow its already robust 5.7% distribution yield by at least 6% a year for the next three years. (Don't worry! TurboTax easily takes care of the pesky K-1 at tax time.) SEP's price is right too! SEP's stock price is lower than Morningstar's, S&P's and Valuentum's fair value estimates and its price-to-cash flow ratio is at its lowest in the last 7 years. 3. United Technologies (NYSE: UTX ) - I've got my eye on UTX. It's on my watch list for the Dividend House portfolio. My portfolio minimum is 2.7% and UTX is trading at 2.66%. So, it's in my consideration zone. Why? UTX has 23 years of increasing dividends, an A- S&P credit rating, a low 40% debt-to-total capital ratio and a 60% payout ratio. So far, so good! What's more, UTX grew its dividend at 9% a year for the last 5 years and is expected to do the same going forward. I just wish I'd caught UTX's major price downdraft in February. Speaking of price, even though UTX's price is well off its February lows, it's still trading more cheaply than Morningstar's, S&P's and Valuentum's fair value estimates as well as S&P's 12-month target. To boot, UTX's current 15.4 P/E is lower than it has been in the last 18 years. I may have to git some! Two More Attractive, High Quality DGI Possibilities! But wait, here's a couple more! In doing the research for Mike's article, I found two more stocks that may tempt you, depending on your portfolio's needs. 4. Cardinal Health (NYSE: CAH ) - My daughter's birthday is this month (she'll be 23), which means I'll be contributing to her retirement account. (I think I have gotten her used to the fact that her "big present" on birthdays and Christmas now goes into her retirement fund.) Guess what I'm planning to purchase? Yep, CAH! CAH has been increasing its dividends every year for 19 years - even through the 2001 tech bubble and the Great Recession. With an S&P credit rating of A-, a 41% debt-to-total capital, a 43% payout ratio, a 15% historical 5-year dividend growth rate, and an estimated 10% estimated future 3-year dividend growth rate, CAH looks very attractive. The only quibble I personally have with CAH is its dividend yield of only 2.3% (which is why it isn't in my portfolio yet). From a price standpoint, CAH's price/earnings ratio is 15.2, which is lower than its historical average P/E ratio for 16 of the last 18 years. CAH is currently trading lower than S&P's, Morningstar's and Valuetum's fair value estimates. 5. Omega Healthcare Investors (NYSE: OHI ) - With its 7% dividend yield, 14 years of increasing dividends, and 10% historical dividend growth rate, OHI's dividend looks quite attractive. REIT guru Brad Thomas maintained a BUY on OHI's shares in this article published on May 18. So, the only negative for me is OHI's BBB- credit rating. OHI certainly is priced attractively. Its current price is trading below Morningstar's, S&P's and Valuentum's fair value estimates. And, at its current P/FFO of 10.1, F.A.S.T. Graphs shows that OHI is trading at its lowest P/FFO ratio in 18 years! Bonus! Other stocks that are attractively priced that you may want to consider for due diligence are HCP (NYSE: HCP ), Gilead (NASDAQ: GILD ), Care Capital Properties (NYSE: CCP ), and Union Pacific (NYSE: UNP ). I'm not necessarily ecstatic about all of these, and I wouldn't necessarily recommend them for everyone, but I do currently hold all of them either in my portfolio or my daughter's. The good news is that, even in today's s-t-r-e-t-c-h-e-d DGI market, depending on your portfolio needs, there's gold in them thar hills! So, if you are digging for attractively priced, high quality DGI stocks, take a look at AAPL, SEP, UTX, CAH, OHI, HCP, GILD, CCP, and UNP. But, buyer beware! Not all of these stocks belong in every DGI portfolio. Some of them may have yields that are too low or credit ratings that don't pass muster. Some of them may not have the minimum number of years of increasing dividends that you require. Others may not be growing their dividends fast enough for you. Even so, I believe that all of these stocks have a place in some DGI portfolios. We have all of them either in my portfolio, my daughter's portfolio, or on our watch lists. Only you can decide if any of these ideas are a fit or a possibility for you! I hope this article has sparked some ideas for your own due diligence. I would love to hear about the high quality DGI stocks that you think are priced attractively right now.
