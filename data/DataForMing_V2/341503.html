Apple Gets Dissed, But Might Have Last VR Laugh - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Facebook-owned Oculus said it won't support Apple Macs unless Apple makes its computers better. Apple, however, didn't respond to the Oculus' comments. Palmer Luckey, the founder of VR (virtual reality) vendor Oculus VR, recently said if Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) ever releases a good computer, Oculus will support Apple. Oculus VR, currently owned by Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), will start shipping its VR headset Rift later this month. The Rift VR headset doesn't support Macs simply because they aren't powerful enough. When Luckey was asked in an interview if they would support Apple's computers going forward, he replied, "That is up to Apple. If they ever release a good computer, we will do it." Although Luckey raised an important and perhaps valid question, Apple didn't bother to respond to his remarks. For smoothly running Rift on Windows, Oculus recommends a graphics card equivalent to at least Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA ) GTX 970 or AMD's (NASDAQ: AMD ) R9 290, and a processor equivalent to at least Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) i5-4590. Oculus also provides Oculus-ready PCs made by Dell, Asus or Alienware for optimum VR experience, along with the Rift headset at a special bundle offer. Although it's hard to believe there isn't a single Mac out there with equivalent specs as mentioned above, Luckey said: It just boils down to the fact that Apple doesn't prioritize high-end GPUs. You can buy a $6,000 Mac Pro with the top of the line AMD FirePro D700, and it still doesn't match our recommended specs. According to Luckey, Apple doesn't anymore prioritize higher-end GPUs like before. However, I'm not entirely convinced how Apple doesn't prioritize higher-end GPUs when its Mac Pro comes with a far superior FirePro D700 graphics card compared to what's required for running Rift. Perhaps what Luckey wanted to say is that although a FirePro D700 graphics card is aimed at supporting professional quality graphics for the digital media industry, it isn't optimized for gaming. It's true Apple doesn't build Macs with gamers in mind. But it's also true that VR isn't all about gaming, although gaming will be a substantial part of it. The obvious question then - is Oculus building Rift only for the gamers? Well, it could be, at least initially. However, I believe Apple has a different game plan with VR. Apple has various options as far as VR is concerned. A recent article written by SA author Mark Hibben excellently covered Apple's most compelling options. While people have different opinions over which option would be best for increasing Apple's revenue, there's one thing for certain - Apple won't let its ecosystem overlap with other ecosystems, such as Windows. The most logical option for Apple would be to launch either a VR headset like Rift tethered to the Mac, or a completely standalone untethered device. In any case, Apple's objective will be keeping its ecosystem separate while making it more diverse. Therefore, it's quite natural Apple didn't respond to Luckey's comments. And I don't believe it will be interested in Rift either. Apple has different operating systems for different products, such as OS X for Macs, iOS for mobile devices, tvOS for Apple TV and so forth. These operating systems constitute Apple's ecosystem as a whole. For its VR device, I expect Apple will write a new operating system, which will strengthen and diversify its existing ecosystem further. Apple Needs To Develop A Robust Gaming Platform Serious gamers never take Apple seriously. Since VR is becoming mainstream primarily embracing games, Apple needs to solidify its gaming footprint if it wants to succeed in VR. Although Apple has a lot of things to offer via VR, such as streaming videos and Apple TV via VR headset, gaming will remain the most significant revenue generator in the evolving VR industry. That's why Oculus is building Rift primarily for gamers. So far, Apple had no compelling reason to create a gaming platform, such as Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Xbox or Sony's (NYSE: SNE ) PlayStation. However, with VR becoming mainstream, it would be difficult for Apple to ignore gamers going forward. As I mentioned in a previous article , Apple has many intellectual properties in the field of AR (augmented reality). It remains to be seen if the company comes up with an AR/MR (mixed reality) device like Microsoft's HoloLens. However, even if Apple launches an MR device some time going into the future, it still makes sense to roll out a VR device, given its streaming video and Apple TV ventures.
