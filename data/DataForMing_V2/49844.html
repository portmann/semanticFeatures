Maximize Returns: Sell Netflix And Starz, Long Time Warner And Fox | Seeking Alpha Peer Comps draw an ugly picture for Netflix & Starz. We expect Time Warner & Twenty-First Century Fox to outperform. Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) members aren't the only ones binging on content. Netflix CEO Reed Hastings and company are binging on contractual obligations (content library offerings) and, unlike their members, not losing any sleep in the process. Does the wonderful world of purchase agreements, obligations and off-balance sheet financing provide any useful insights? If they do, and one took into consideration what these numbers were saying, it would be no surprise that Netflix is growing at its current pace. They are simply meeting consumer demand and not making any money doing so. Well, the executives are making plenty of money. By taking a look at these numbers, I can draw these insights: Companies with a competitive advantage have a CO/revenue under 40%. They are producing quality content and do not need to purchase expensive third party content to attract/retain customers. Time Warner has the best ratio. They do not need to spend big on third party content because the majority of their content is created in-house and from Warner Bros. Studios. The biggest chunk of their long-term obligations come from sports broadcasting contracts - baseball, basketball, the NCAA - for the Turner networks. If they chose to, they could turn up the spending and capture revenue growth. This is totally up to the executive team's strategy and I believe HBO NOW will be that engine. B+ : Twenty-First Century Fox (NASDAQ: FOXA ) FOXA is another producer of high quality content and it shows in their short-term obligations. They have the largest long-term obligation ratio thanks to expensive sports contracts - the NFL isn't cheap. FOX has to spend big for sports entertainment but it is an anchor for its networks and is highly profitable - for now. AMC is the producer of hit TV shows like The Walking Dead, Breaking Bad and Mad Men. What the ratio tells us is they produce quality shows and don't need to spend heavily via contractual obligations, be it long-term or short-term. However, their profitability will be at risk if they do not continue producing hit shows. We believe there is risk here due to Breaking Bad ending last year and Mad Men ending this year. That leaves them with just The Walking Dead, and while it is popular there's no telling if it will fall off due to either a slip in quality, a change in story telling trends, some combination of both or other as yet unforeseen circumstances. Starz is another content distributor that does not produce a lot of quality content and needs to pay high premiums as a result. Their loss of the rights to Disney (NYSE: DIS ) movies is big if Sony Pictures, Weintstein and Lions Gate (NYSE: LGF ) are unable to roll out hit movies to help make up the losses. There has been whispers of a Lions Gate/Starz merger and Starz is trading at record highs as a result. With the highest profitability in the group, we believe this trend will not continue and profitability will eventually come down. Netflix has the worst ratio. Not only are their current obligations 72% of 2014 revenues, their long-term obligations are over almost double their revenue and that number is growing. This is a huge red flag. We expect their long-term obligations to continue growing at this pace, leaving us to believe peer profitability is nowhere in sight. The bull argument is that Netflix is investing for the future, but the reality is they are just spending. They operate on the AWS platform which is a pay per consumption platform. Netflix doesn't need to invest heavily in data centers, they just need to spend heavily on content to retain members. Despite what profitability executive management aspires to meet, it doesn't change the reality of their situation. The uncertainty of member retention without the large content expense is not a gamble Hastings & Co. is willing to take. Therefore, long-term profitability will be suppressed to the mid-single digits for a long time. Let's call Netflix what it is, the Costco/Wal-Mart/Amazon of content distribution and realize they will have Costco/Wal-Mart/Amazon type profitability. From a growth perspective it looks like Time Warner has the ability to grow and attract subscribers since they have the lowest ratio of CO/revenue percentage. This, of course, is up to executive discretion and we are not looking to bash Netflix but the numbers do the talking and investors would be smart to place their money elsewhere. If you are a holder, take your profits and run. We decided to take a long/short basket approach and will reassess annually. Our assessment will change if Netflix gobbles up a network (or networks) or studio (studios). This could be AMC, Lionsgate, Viacom, etc. Since Netflix has very little cash, this would be a stock-based and debt-based purchase at a significant premium to the current market.
