Breaking The PR Mold For Apple Watch - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple Watch is positioned and promoted as a style accessory and mainstream consumer product, not just a technology product or iPhone extension. Apple is very good at PR, and they are using all of their old tricks as well as some unprecedented new ones. Early signs are that all this is working. This positioning of Apple Watch allows it to address a large enough market to make it a meaningful product for Apple. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) PR is legendary for creating excitement and desire around new tech products. Their approach has evolved and expanded for Apple Watch in order to reach separate style-conscious and mainstream audiences, both largely disconnected from tech. This will make Apple Watch a massive consumer product. The 2013 Apple commercial " Misunderstood " depicts a family that thinks their son is withdrawing as they gather for Christmas, only to learn that he was making a touching and all-inclusive family video. The ad marked a new positioning of Apple as a meaningful and practical part of the user's daily life. While there has not (yet) been a comparable Apple Watch tearjerker, there have been many references to Watch as a "personal" product. A masterful concerto of leaks, top-secret seeding with chosen developers, details shared through 'sources' to key technology writers and carefully placed pre-release reviews has whet the market's appetite for new iPods, iPhones and Macs through the years. These were topped off by the CEO's keynote, a demo, media access and a few great ads showing off the new product. This is all happening for Apple Watch as it did for products before. Apple has broadened its Watch PR to mainstream outlets, placing pre-release Watches with news and business publications having an audience for high-end products. At four of the top ten, tech is only an occasional focus - USA Today, New York Times, Bloomberg Business and the Wall Street Journal (outside of Walt Mossberg's AllThingsD section). Also unique to Apple Watch, the international reviewers included Australian watch maven Bani McSpedden. His web site has video reviews titled "A minute with…" featuring timepieces like the Bethune DB25 White Night , a Swiss watch that retails for $60,000. Ahead of the reviews, Apple invited ABC News into their top-secret fitness research lab for a segment that aired on the evening news and Good Morning America. Totally unprecedented for a company where secrecy is Job #1. The very reticent Jony Ive has given several major interviews in the last year, starting with the March 17, 2014 profile in Time magazine. None were tech publications. Vogue and the Vanity Fair Summit followed that fall, then this year Ive was interviewed by the New Yorker and the "How to Spend It" section of the Financial Times . Every time he directly or indirectly mentioned Apple Watch, talking about its personal nature to the user instead of technology or features. Again Apple Watch is featured in mainstream publications read by high-end buyers. Apple has even pulled a first-ever PR stunt. Months before the March 9th official launch, Jony Ive hosted Karl Lagerfeld and Anna Wintour for an Apple Watch try-on. During Paris Fashion Week. At a one-day popup shop, not one of the two Apple Stores located there. This generated headlines like "Apple Gatecrashes Paris Fashion Week" with coverage in decidedly stylish and non-tech places like Vogue UK and Fashionista.com . All these extra steps are obviously intended to make Apple Watch into a massive consumer product. Look for fashion icons and celebrities to be seen wearing and using Apple Watch. And it will doubtless appear in TV shows and movies, where Apple has been quietly placing its products for years. Tech product lineups are differentiated by specs. More memory, faster clock speed and so on. Differentiation between Apple Watch models matches consumer lineups, not tech. The "cheap one" is lightweight aluminum with bright-colored plastic bands, like a shirt you might find at stylish but inexpensive stores. The $10,000 Edition is heavy gold with subtle and unique bands, yet technologically identical to the others. Like the expensive dress shirt at a high-end clothier, the materials are better but it is the style and exclusivity that justify the price. This is the sort of thing one would expect with Angela Ahrendts on board. Matching the positioning of the conventional watch market is brilliant. Buyers are already familiar with that kind of differentiation and price range for a consumer product, making it easy for Apple to take a chunk out of Swatch Group's $9B or so in annual sales as buyers opt for smart vs 'dumb' watches. Positioning as a consumer style product is far more important for another reason. While the progression from early adopters to the majority is precarious for new products - described in the tech-marketing bible " Crossing the Chasm " - it is established and well understood for clothing and other fashion. Apple Watch is going to vault across the chasm faster than you can say Katy Perry. Giving people more time to get introduced to a completely new product and get used to the idea of technology they will experience more intimately may also explain the very atypical launch for Apple Watch. Steve Jobs would always wrap his introductions saying when you could buy the new product. Often it was "now" and always within a few weeks. Apple Watch was announced months ago with only a vague and distant availability date. Perhaps that is the new style of Tim Cook and other post-Jobs leadership. Or it could be last-minute software and supply-chain kinks being worked out. Apple being Apple, it is unlikely to be anything other than an intentional choice. Apple seems unconcerned about initial shipment numbers or delays, and I don't think investors need to be concerned either. Apple is playing a long game here. They are not only embedding the idea of wrist-worn technology into our global culture, they are making it stylish and cool. By appealing to a full range of consumers and accessing both traditional watch and new wearable computing markets, Apple has entered a product category that will allow it again to overcome the law of large numbers. EDIT (13-April) Since this article was submitted on 11-April, a report from Slice intelligence claims that over 1 million Apple Watches may have been sold on Friday when pre-orders sold out.
