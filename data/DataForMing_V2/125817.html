Ford: Will This Car Bring An End To Its Struggle In This Key Growth Market? - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha The Indian auto market is expected to hit sales of $150 billion-$200 billion in the coming years, but Ford has been unable to make a dent in this market. Ford's sales in India in the first half of 2015 have taken a massive hit as compared to last year due to lack of new models. Ford, however, is set to introduce the Figo Aspire sub-compact sedan in India to tap a segment that accounts for 20% of the Indian auto market currently. The Aspire is a better car than the competition in safety, technology, and power, and if Ford prices it right, its struggles in India could come to an end. For Ford (NYSE: F ), India is not a very big market. In fact, the company holds a market share of just over 2% in India, while from an overall perspective, it sold just 154,121 vehicles in the country last year as compared to global sales of over 6.3 million units. Thus, India is a speck in Ford's global operations, but it is one market that Ford is desperately trying to tap. Looking ahead, India's auto market is expected to hit 6 million units in annual sales by 2020. Additionally, by the end of 2030, the Indian car market is anticipated to sell over 10 million units annually, generating revenue of $150 billion-$200 billion. In fact, India will be among the top 3 auto markets going forward, as shown below: As such, it is evident that Ford needs to pull up its socks in this market, or else it might miss out on rapid growth in India. However, the company has not done well so far in India this year. Ford delivered another terrible performance in the month of June 2015. Ford's sales in India have dropped in each month of the year so far. At the end of June, its domestic sales figure stood at 32,115 units, down 22.4% down from last year's 41,363 units. Alarmingly, the rate of decline has consistently increased month over month as shown below. One of the main reasons behind Ford's declining sales in India is the absence of new cars in its portfolio. Almost all important Ford products, including the Figo hatchback and the Endeavour SUV are now outdated, and need to be replaced with new models. The company had tried to generate interest in these two models by launching mid-life facelifts, but they did not appeal much to the buyers. In fact, it's been long since Ford launched a new model in India. However, over the last couple of months, the company has been trying to bring in some excitement among the Indian public. Ford India had already announced its plans to launch 4 new cars over the year starting from mid-2015. The company is showcasing first of its to-be-introduced three products, the Figo Aspire , to customers in 25 cities across the country as part of a pan-India road show. The other 3 cars that Ford is making ready for India for the months to come are the new-gen Figo, the Endeavour SUV, and the Ford Mustang. However, in this article, we will take a closer look at the Figo Aspire. This will turn out to be a key model for the company as it marks it foray into the sub-4 meter sedan segment, an area that's growing at a consistent pace and accounts for almost 20% of total car sales in the country. Like the SUV and crossover segments in the U.S., the sub-compact sedan segment is growing at a fast pace in India. As a result, Ford's soon to be launched Aspire can be expected to reverse its pathetic show in the country. The Ford Figo Aspire will be rolled out just before this year's festive season with the following specs. The model will carry certain first-in-segment features such as the Ford My Key, which will enable the owner to program the key to ensure that the driver of the car drives responsibly. It will have two options in petrol engines and one diesel option. The 1.5 liter petrol engine option will offer a 6-speed Powershift dual-clutch automatic gearbox, which is also a first in class feature. More importantly, the initial reviews about the Ford Aspire are positive, as reviewers are of the opinion that it is different from its competitors in several ways. The attractive design and easy to handle features come along as legacy features with any Ford model. Unlike many of its rivals, Ford has not chosen to just add a boot to a hatchback and make it a sedan. It's a design that Ford has developed from the ground-up. The mileage that its engine is going to offer is also one of the highest in the segment. In the diesel variant, after detuning, the mileage can be expected to reach up to 25 km/lt. Moreover, since the car is less than 4 meters in length, it is eligible for excise duty benefits. This will help the company in pricing it competitively in this highly price-sensitive market. As far as the competition is concerned, the Aspire will go up against the likes of established players such as the Suzuki ( OTCPK:SZKMY ) Swift Dzire and Honda (NYSE: HMC ) Amaze, along with the Tata Zest (NYSE: TTM ) and the Hyundai ( OTC:HYMPY ) Xcent. Compared to the industry pioneer Maruti ( OTC:MRZUY ) Swift Dzire, Ford's compact sedan will definitely have an upper hand . The Aspire is a smartly designed car from inside the cabin. Certain advanced features like SYNC with AppLink, Ford's advanced in-car connectivity system, and Emergency Assistance will give it an edge over the Dzire. Against the other major rivals (Hyundai Xcent and Tata Zest), the Aspire has an advantage in terms of power and safety, along with better power and torque figures. If Ford prices this product right, it might have a winner on its hand Ford is going to target different segments of the Indian market by offering variety. This strategy will help it bring its sales back on track in this fast-growing auto market. But, to compete here, Ford needs to price its products well, apart from offering something new to the Indian buyer. With the Aspire, the company is trying to do just that as it is now targeting a segment that accounts for 20% of the Indian market, and is still growing. Thus, driven by such initiatives, I won't be surprised if the company is able to crack this fast-growing market in the long run, and ultimately improve its overall financial performance given the expected size of the Indian car market going forward.
