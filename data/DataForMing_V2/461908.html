Netflix: Buy On The Drop? - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Netflix is down 13% after hours following a lackluster Q2 report. Shares are being hammered by slowing subscriber growth as video streaming competition supposedly continues to mount. Competition in the space is fierce, but Netflix has competitive advantages. This article is my 22nd installment in a segment called "Buy on the Drop?" where I choose a stock that recently experienced a large decrease in price and give a recommendation on whether investors should "Buy on the Drop" or not. This is a recurring segment, so if you enjoy the article, "Follow" me to see more. You can read about my previous installment discussing Biogen (NASDAQ: BIIB ) here . Most of you reading this article likely already know the details of Netflix's (NASDAQ: NFLX ) Q2 report and the subsequent price drop, but I will provide a quick summary of events to get everyone up to speed. Shares in NFLX are down 13% after hours as I write this on the heels of an underwhelming report that seemed to validate fears of slowing growth at the company. The drop continues the trend of NFLX flying all over the radar as this 1 year price chart shows: It appears that every time shares take a nosedive, they always pop right back up again. Will recent history repeat itself or is this time different for NFLX? Let's take a look at that report! On the surface, Netflix's second quarter appeared fine, if not solid, with EPS of $0.09 beating consensus analyst estimates and revenue of $2 billion in line with estimates. But a further look will reveal the source of investor disappointment: subscriber additions (or lack thereof). Netflix said in its Q1 report that it had expected to add 2.5 million subscribers in Q2, which made actual additions of 1.7 million fairly underwhelming. For its part, Netflix partially blamed higher than expected churn, which the company said was caused by its announcement during the quarter that long-time Netflix members would be un-grandfathered from previous price increases. Netflix said users likely misinterpreted that announcement as a price hike and cancelled subscriptions. I do believe that this was a factor in Netflix's subscriber miss, but is it the whole story? How much of a factor is competition from other video streaming services on Netflix's performance? Netflix doesn't think competition had much impact and in the Q2 report stated "Our view . . . is that [Netflix and other streaming services] are all growing primarily against linear TV hours and that competition did not contribute materially to our miss in Q2." Provided in the report is a chart from Sandvine (SVC), a network equipment company, which seems to corroborate this claim: Netflix's share of internet traffic has remained mostly steady, seemingly indicating that competition isn't exactly a pressing issue for the company. It may not be completely measurable yet, but the story told by this graphic is not entirely accurate. Competition is affecting Netflix, not in revenue or market share but rather in the cash flow department. The company again recorded negative free cash flow, primarily due to the capital requirements of Netflix's original series and films, which require cash upfront as opposed to licensing deals. The substantial capital and resources Netflix has poured into original content has allowed it to maintain modest subscriber growth and to continue to generate robust revenue growth. After all, lost in all the mania over subscriber numbers, U.S. revenue and international revenue were up 33% and 67% year-over-year, respectively. However, Netflix's cash burn rate is not improving and the company is dedicating a big portion of its resources towards creating original content. If you read the bullet points, you might remember I recommended buying on the drop. What gives with all this negativity? Well have no fear, that ends right now. From here on out, it's all positive and there's plenty to discuss. Firstly, for those focused on subscriber growth fears, I would point towards Netflix's forecasted Q3 additions, which indicate a rebound from the lackluster Q2 figures. The company expects to add 300k U.S. subscribers and 2 million international subscribers in the third quarter, much better than one might expect after subscriber growth fears were supposedly validated. Add in the fact that Q2 is a seasonally-weak quarter for subscriber additions and the fears seem overblown. But if you're still worried about Q2's big subscriber miss and whether it indicates a peaking of new additions, here is Netflix refuting claims that competition was the cause for the miss: First, increased competition would show up mostly in soft gross additions rather than churn. Second, we experienced a similar uptick in churn in early April in Canada, where there has been no recent increase in SVOD competition but where unÂ­grandfathering is also underway. In regards to the first point, recall from earlier in the article that the primary catalyst for the subscriber miss was churn caused by un-grandfathering, and not from softer than expected gross additions (which were in line with company forecasts). This implies that the subscriber miss was caused by the unforeseen churn, which Netflix said was "coincident" with press coverage of its un-grandfathering. Seems like a legitimate reason to me. If this is the case, then the stagnant subscriber growth in Q2 would seem to be explained by un-grandfathering, a short-term headwind, as opposed to competition, which would be a much more worrisome issue. In addition, I think the un-grandfathering effect was taken into account by Netflix for Q3, which led to the relatively underwhelming expected gross subscriber additions for the quarter of 2.3 million, well below analyst consensus of 3.5 million. The discrepancy here is likely due to a combination of the previously unaccounted for increased churn caused by the un-grandfathering effect and unrealistically high expectations from analysts. Was the stock's valuation propped up by those unrealistically high expectations? Did the stock deserve to fall by not meeting those expectations? We'll get into that a little later. To sum up the discussion of subscriber additions, it is my opinion that the un-grandfathering of tenured Netflix subscribers caused unexpected churn, which precipitated the substantial subscriber miss. Q2 was an anomaly that should not be taken as a legitimate indicator of Netflix's future. Q3 will also be affected by un-grandfathering, but the short-term pain of lower subscriber additions will be well worth the long-term revenue gains Netflix is reaping from the un-grandfathering process. The second issue I would like to address is that of free cash flow. Netflix reported -$254 million in FCF in Q2, and laid out reasoning to back up the poor results: Our capital requirements continue to be driven by our investment in original content, particularly programming that we produce, which requires more cash upfront relative to licensed content. Original content provides Netflix with many benefits: new programming that debuts on Netflix, exclusivity, greater creative and business control, global rights and brand halo. These merits outweigh the timing of cash payments. Do you agree? Do the benefits of original programming outweigh the negative free cash flow that has become commonplace on Netflix's statement of cash flows? Considering my bullish sentiment, you might have guessed my opinion on the matter. Yes, the capital requirements of Netflix's original programming pale in comparison to the benefits it produces for the company. First, as I stated earlier, original content has allowed Netflix to maintain its leading position in video streaming despite intense competition from numerous other such services. Burning cash to remain the top player in a market that is very much still up for grabs is a small price to pay. Second, and more importantly, Netflix's original programming is what sets it apart from other streaming services and is what will fuel the company's long-term success in the crowded video streaming market. The time will come when the market becomes saturated and the different services will indeed be competing intensely among each other for limited customers. When this occurs, content will be king. In my opinion, it will soon get to the point where the programming currently included cable packages will be available across most streaming services, and the only other significant decision point for consumers will be the original programming for each service. In that department, Netflix is the clear winner as it has shown a willingness to spend big bucks on original content that has been both critically-acclaimed and popular. In that way, Netflix is ahead of the game because management knows that the future of streaming services is original content, and it has been the only streaming company so far to show full commitment in that area (go check the wikipedia pages for original programming by each of the large streaming services). From an investor standpoint, I have no problem with the negative free cash flow. Netflix has plenty of cash ($1.8 billion) and low interest rates will be around for the foreseeable future so selling debt to raise cash will not present any financial difficulty. And if cash burn is the price to pay to set up future success, count me a believer. I have discussed weak subscriber additions and negative free cash flow, and have provided reasons why I don't believe Netflix's long-term growth or business fundamentals have been put at risk by any data contained within the company's second quarter earnings report. How about valuation? This is always tricky with NFLX because there is no bar we can utilize to measure video streaming companies; Netflix is essentially the first successful one. Including the after-hours selloff, NFLX's market capitalization is approximately $36.8 billion with a P/E above 300. So what does this tell us? Pretty much nothing if you ask me. Traditional valuation techniques will do no good with Netflix just like it will do no good with stocks like Tesla Motors (NASDAQ: TSLA ). So what do investors have to go on? Netflix will likely record somewhere near $8 billion in revenue and $0.25 EPS for full-year 2016 (very rough estimates). For growing companies, the top line is a better indicator than the bottom line or cash flow, and in that regard Netflix has demonstrated impressive revenue growth despite a perceived increase in competition. And in one area in particular I emphatically agree with Netflix management: the video streaming market is still very far away from even approaching saturation. The market that video streaming is undercutting is still worth hundreds of billions of dollars and it is all there for the taking with Netflix as the major beneficiary as the clear leader. Forget using quantitative metrics to value NFLX shares. If you're shorting NFLX because it has a high P/E ratio or because it's "valuation is absurd" then you're bound to get burned because you're missing the forest for the trees. Yes, Netflix stock is overvalued according to standard valuation metrics, but stocks don't trade on valuation metrics. They trade on future expectations. Short NFLX if you think the company is destined to get overtaken by competitors, because in almost any other scenario NFLX shares will come out more valuable than they are today. The market has spoken: video streaming is the new norm. There is no debate. Either you think Netflix will dominate the space and end up on top or you think Netflix is not the future leader of video streaming. As far as I'm concerned, any other argument is missing the big picture. And from what I've seen, Netflix is and will continue to be the video streaming king. I rate Netflix a Strong Buy on the drop.
