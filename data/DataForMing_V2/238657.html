Ford seeks to expand SUV portfolio, sees market at 40 percent by 2020 | Reuters A man checks a new model Ford EcoSport SUV (sport utility vehicle) car during its launch ceremony at automaker Ford Vietnam's factory in Vietnam's northern Hai Duong province, outside Hanoi June 27, 2014. Ford Motor Co (F.N) is looking at ways to expand its sport utility vehicle portfolio as SUVs grow to 40 percent of the U.S. light vehicle market by 2020 from about a third today, global sales chief Stephen Odell told Reuters. "As a segment gets that big, it's probably going to fragment into different requirements," Odell said in an interview ahead of the unveiling on Tuesday in Los Angeles of the 2017 Ford Escape, a re-styled version of the company's best-selling SUV model in the United States. Ford sells a smaller sport utility vehicle called the EcoSport in Europe and Latin America and has studied it for the U.S. market, Odell said. "It could at some point become a substantial part of the industry," he said. Separately, United Auto Workers union officials and analysts have said they expect Ford to use a factory in Wayne, Michigan to build a new SUV and a new pickup truck after production of the Ford Focus compact car is moved to Mexico in 2018. Sales of the current Escape in the United States should beat last yearâ€™s record of 306,212 vehicles, Odell said. But Escape sales are rising at a slower pace than several competitors, up just 1 percent for the year to date compared with 15 percent for Toyota Motor Corp's (7203.T) RAV4 and 41 percent for Nissan Motor Co (7201.T) 's Rogue. The intense competition Ford faces is reflected in decisions the company made as it revised the 2017 Escape, which goes on sale next year. Ford redesigned the exterior and interior of the 2017 Escape. But it wonâ€™t offer collision avoiding automatic emergency braking systems on the 2017 Escape, Odell said. Toyota said it will offer such collision avoiding systems as optional equipment for $300 to $500 on many 2017 models. "We think weâ€™ve got more than enough safety technology on this product thatâ€™s relevant to the drivers that they would be prepared to pay for," Odell said. Vehicles in the Escapeâ€™s class have starting prices just under $24,000, and Japanese and European competitors currently have cheaper currencies to offset the cost of new features. Ford and several other automakers agreed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in September to make automatic emergency braking standard on future new vehicles for the U.S. market. But the automakers didnâ€™t set a deadline. NEW YORK - Many big companies follow a strategy of  stock buybacks and acquisitions.  Critics argue these moves cannibalize innovation and slow growth.   Special Report   Whatâ€™s Next: Tomorrowâ€™s Digital Life Thomson Reuters is the world's largest international multimedia news agency, providing investing news , world news , business news , technology news , headline news, small business news , news alerts, personal finance , stock market , and mutual funds information available on Reuters.com, video , mobile , and interactive television platforms.
