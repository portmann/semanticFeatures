Will Verizon Take Notice Of What AT&T Is Doing Right? - AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) | Seeking Alpha AT&T has created separation from VZ's stock over the last few months, which historically is against the norm. AT&T acquired DTV, and two Mexican carriers, and is making big investments in its U-Verse broadband service. The disconnect between AT&T (NYSE: T ) and Verizon's (NYSE: VZ ) stock continues to widen, as analysts and investors see more long-term upside in the former. AT&T has received upgrade after upgrade as analysts see revenue growth and cost-saving synergies from its acquisition of DirecTV (NASDAQ: DTV ), and the growth that comes with expanding its wireless network to cover another 100 million consumers. Lastly, AT&T continues to grow in wireline with U Verse, thereby building on the positive momentum surrounding the company. As a result, the question now becomes whether Verizon will take notice of AT&T's changes, and make similar moves. First and foremost, acquiring DirecTV will grow AT&T's free cash flow by more than 30% based on both companies' trailing 12-month total, and create well over $2 billion in cost savings from infrastructure synergies, content overlap, combined salesforce, etc. Yes, the acquisition will increase AT&T's share count by nearly 20%, but when you look at the long-term prospects, including an entry into Latin America, the acquisition has far more upside potential than downside. By combining AT&T's wireline broadband services with DirecTV's satellite network, AT&T will have a near unprecedented reach that'll expand well beyond the 20 million premises that Verizon's competing FiOS services pass through. Therefore, in order to better compete against AT&T's wireline and video business will Verizon make a move for DirecTV competitor DISH Network? In my opinion, the move is very unlikely. Verizon has drastically cut spending in its wireline segment, leaving many metropolitan areas like New York largely underdeveloped , and most recently even selling assets to Frontier. Based on the fact that Verizon is guiding for its CapEx budget to decline in 2015, and expects no cuts in its wireless unit, one could conclude that Verizon is not emphasizing video, internet, or wireline in general. In fact, Verizon has even said that it plans to make cuts in wireline. This makes a bid for DISH Network highly unlikely, and it also makes it very unlikely that Verizon will follow AT&T's lead in rapid expansion and upgrades to its high-speed broadband/internet business. Lastly, on the issue of expansion into new markets, Verizon doesn't appear to have any interest (in Mexico). Verizon's Fran Shammo has said that the company will invest in its U.S. wireless business and that margins will rise over time. That's good and all, but Mexico and even Latin America are not nearly as competitive as the U.S., regions that are mostly controlled by a single carrier, America Movil (NYSE: AMX ). AT&T paid just $4.4 billion to acquire the third and fourth largest Mexican carriers, a price that wouldn't purchase the 10th largest carrier here in the U.S. With that $4.4 billion, AT&T will invest another $3.5 billion to expand its Mexican coverage area from 40 million to 100 million by the end of 2018. That gives AT&T a huge opportunity for monetization, one that Verizon does not have and apparently has no interest in. Furthermore, AT&T has a very similar opportunity in Latin America with broadband, as the spectrum is present through the acquisition of DirecTV to build a large broadband network with an addressable market of 50 million users. Once more, Verizon has no such opportunity. All things considered, it is tough to imagine that Verizon sees what AT&T is doing and has no interest in similar expansion. My belief is that Verizon overpaid to take full control of its Wireless business, and that the $130 billion price tag is keeping Verizon from expanding. As Verizon sells assets to buy spectrum and pay off debt, Verizon's long-term investment opportunity seems more tied to profitability and a low single-digit growth rate, despite the lofty growth outlook for data consumption . Meanwhile, AT&T has the opportunity for significant top-line growth, maybe double-digit for many years to come. Consequently, because AT&T's growth will come from less competitive markets, Latin America and Mexico, it is very possible that it too generates higher margins due to less competitive pricing. Notably, America Movil's operating margin of 17% is more than 70% higher than that of AT&T. As a result, I continue to see AT&T as the superior investment opportunity over Verizon, and believe that the stock price disconnect is a reflection of its superiority. With Verizon showing no signs to act in a similar manner as AT&T over the last year, it's safe to assume that the investment outlook between these two companies will finally be distinguished. In other words, AT&T looks poised to trade much higher whereas the outlook for Verizon's stock is not nearly as bullish. Source: Will Verizon Take Notice Of What AT&T Is Doing Right?
