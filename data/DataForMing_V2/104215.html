Boeing boosts 2015 jet prices 2.9%, 777X jumps to $400M - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha To screen ETFs by asset class, performance, yield and more, check out the ETF Hub. ETF Hub Jul  1 2015, 19:20 ET | About: The Boeing Company (BA) | By: Carl Surran , SA News Editor Boeing (NYSE: BA ) says it is raising list prices for its jetliners by 2.9% , in the company's annual price adjustment based on an internal formula that takes into account increases in the costs of goods, services and labor; prices rose 3.1% in  2014. The price of BA's updated 777X, due for delivery by 2020, rises to $400M in the new price list; the catalog prices do not reflect the industry's customary discounts. Separately, Wells Fargo believes any pressure on shares related to Congress' failure to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank’s charter - which expired last night - is unwarranted , since Congress could reauthorize Ex-Im in July, there is abundant liquidity for aircraft currently, and if necessary Boeing can finance its own deliveries.
