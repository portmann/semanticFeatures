A $7 Million Boeing 777-200ER Does Not Compare To A Brand New Dreamliner (Part 1) - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Lower purchase price provides a $140 mln advantage. Fitting a modern cabin into the Boeing 777-200ER will add significantly to the costs. Delta (NYSE: DAL ) CEO Richard Anderson 'shocked' Boeing (NYSE: BA ) investors claiming that it could obtain used Boeing 777-200ERs from Boeing for a price of $7.7 mln. This of course put some pressure on Boeing's share prices as more and more Boeing 777s will come off lease in the coming years and this could seriously impact Boeing's order inflow for the Boeing 777. It is not the first time Delta is not favoring new Boeing aircraft, in 2014 Delta favored Airbus' ( OTCPK:EADSF ) bid replacement of the older wide bodies over Boeing's. In this article, I will have a look at how the Boeing 777-200ER compares to the Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner, which could be used as a Boeing 777-200ER replacement. Figure 1: Comparison market value second-hand Boeing 777-200ER and Boeing 787-10 (Source: www.AeroAnalysis.net ) What is clear is that $7.7 mln for a 10-year-old Boeing 777-200ER is reasonable. Fitting a modern cabin into this 10-year-old aircraft might add another $20 mln in costs. Assuming that no other major replacements are required, the Boeing 777-200ER that Delta bought for $7.7 mln, will actually cost $27.7 mln to bring it to today's standards in terms of comfort. This still is much cheaper than the $168.4 mln for the Boeing 787-10. The lower market value also means that Delta's insurance costs for this airframe are lower. Typically, the annual insurance costs are 1%-2% of the market value for new aircraft. For older aircraft this can be as high as 5%. In this case, I will apply 5% of the market value for the second-hand Boeing 777, giving it the maximum 'penalty' possible. Figure 2: Comparison annual insurance costs second-hand Boeing 777-200ER and Boeing 787-10 (Source: AeroAnalysis) What can be seen is that the insurance costs for the Boeing 777 are almost $2 mln lower per annum compared to the Boeing 787-10. Figure 3: Comparison annual depreciation second-hand Boeing 777-200ER and Boeing 787-10 (Source: AeroAnalysis) The depreciation depends on how many years the aircraft will be in service. For the Boeing 777-200ER, I assumed that the aircraft can operate about 7 years before needing its next heavy maintenance, at which point Delta probably will get rid of the airframe. The value after 7 years is assumed to be almost zero. For the Boeing 787-10, I used a 15-year depreciation model with a 10% value after 15 years. Figure 4: Advantage ownership costs Boeing 777-200ER (Source: AeroAnalysis) Figure 4 shows that the annual ownership costs and the purchase prices for the Boeing 777-200ER yield an advantage of almost $200 mln over the remaining economical viable life of the aircraft. One would say this shifts the advantage to the Boeing 777-200ER without doubt. However, to put this cost advantage into context, it is important to have a look at the difference in revenue as well. Generally, one would say the reliability of an older aircraft will be less. However, with average dispatch reliabilities in excess of 99% for the Boeing 777 and the Boeing 787, the gap seems to be small. Nevertheless, loss of revenue days should be taken into account, but this is hard to quantify. Table 1: Seat count and ticket prices Assuming that the flight is operated on average 1.5 times per day (this includes downtime for maintenance) with a load factor of 85% and the seat count and ticket prices as shown in Table 1, the Boeing 787-10 has a $117.9 mln advantage per annum. What can be concluded is that a major part of the costs to purchase the aircraft are already being compensated for in the first year of service. Despite the higher costs of ownership for the Boeing 787-10, the higher revenue potential makes the Boeing 787-10 an interesting candidate to evaluate. This article focused solely on the cost of ownership and market value. In the following pieces I will add the costs of maintenance, crew, navigation and fuel as well.
