Boeing Q2 2015 Earnings Preview: What To Expect - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Boeing's commercial deliveries increased 8.8% in the second quarter. Boeing will assume a massive charge for its KC-46A fuel system issue which will impact the company's bottom line. The company's backlog remains very strong with net orders for 331 jets so far this year. The American aircraft manufacturer Boeing (NYSE: BA ) is slated to release its second quarter 2015 earnings on July 22, 2015. The company trended lower after the last quarter earnings release on account of lower commercial airplane profit margin. The plane maker's margin was affected by its revolutionary aircraft - the 787 Dreamliner - which has been draining the company's cash on an ongoing basis and is yet to break even. This also took a toll on the jet maker's operating cash flow that came in at $88 million in the first quarter against $1.1 billion a year ago. Will the Dreamliner cast a cloud in the second quarter earnings too? Or will Boeing give an earnings surprise to its investors? Let's take a look at some key metrics to see what to expect from Boeing this earnings season. Boeing's second quarter commercial airplane deliveries increased 8.8% to 197 units compared with last year second quarter. The 737 continues to be the Chicago-headquartered company's bread and butter jet with 128 deliveries during the quarter. It's one of Boeing's key cash making and revenue generating model. The other cash breeding aircraft program, the 777, saw strong deliveries of 26 units. The aircraft model is presently facing headwinds as airlines and leasing companies are keen on ordering for 777's upgraded version, the 777X, which is expected to enter service in 2020. Boeing dispatched 34 787 Dreamliners, which accounted for the second highest deliveries. The company also delivered 5 747s and 4 767s during the quarter. So far through June 2015, Boeing has delivered 381 aircraft . This compares with 342 units delivered in the first half of 2014. Rise in deliveries is welcome news for investors as it signifies stronger cash flows and revenue. Analysts at Yahoo have given an average earnings estimate of $2.14 per share on an average estimated revenue of $24.19 billion. Boeing said on Friday that it would account for a significant U.S. tanker charge as it's having to deal with the KC-46A fuel system issue. The company would assume an after tax charge of $536 million , which would lower the earnings by $.77 a share for the year. This isn't the first time the company is taking a charge on the KC-46 tanker. The jet manufacturer also said that it would need additional funds to finance development cost and certification. Boeing's effort of developing the military aerial refueling tanker happens to be one of its largest defense initiatives. Boeing has received net orders for 331 jets through July 14 this year. The 737 continues to be the airplane maker's top selling model with orders for 253 jets, followed by the 777 that bagged orders for 49 units. As far as the second quarter is concerned, the company reported orders for 209 commercial planes, of which 63 units are from unidentified customers. At the recently organized Paris Air Show, Boeing won several wide body aircraft deals that are more lucrative due to its higher margins in comparison to single aisle planes. Boeing also used the opportunity to strike some crucial deals for the 777, demand for which started waning after the company declared its reengineered aircraft 777X at the Dubai Air Show in 2013. Boeing presently sits on a massive pile of unfilled orders for 5,689 jets. Three out of four planes in the order book is for the 737. The Dreamliner makes for around 14% of the total backlog, followed by the 777 that account for close to 10%. The backlog does not impact the present quarter of the airplane maker. But it's an essential metric investors like to keep tabs on as it's a reflection of the company's future source of revenue and cash flows. Boeing's epic backlog level is more telling than anything else that its production facilities are going to stay occupied with plenty of work. The second quarter should come in pretty pleasant as far as the deliveries and orders are concerned. But it's not over yet. The Dreamliner is going to be one of the key factors deciding how the quarter will turn out to be for the company and its stakeholders at large. In the first quarter of 2015, the Dreamliner's deferred production cost rose $793 million to $27 billion. This means Boeing drained approximately $26 million for every Dreamliner is sold. In the preceding quarter (Q4 2014), Boeing lost an average of $32 million per Dreamliner it delivered. So the company's been continuously bleeding cash selling the Dreamliner. However, there's a silver lining here too. Boeing's cash loss per Dreamliner is narrowing every quarter and it expects the program's cash flow to break even by the end of this year. The Dreamliner's increased deferred cost should not come as a surprise this quarter. But it would be interesting to see to what extent the company's managed to narrow the cash drain per aircraft. Despite a soft start to the year, Boeing reaffirmed its 2015 outlook during the first quarter call with revenue expectation of $94.5-96.5 billion, core earnings per share of $8.20-8.40 and $9 billion in operating cash flow. Boeing's always been very conservative in giving financial outlook and has a track record of beating its own estimates. The fact that the company didn't revise its cash flow for the year, despite a steep fall, suggests that the metric is going to see a remarkable improvement in the remaining quarters. The tanker charge would have an impact on the second quarter earnings. But otherwise investors may expect Boeing to deliver a good quarter with solid revenue growth and narrowing Dreamliner cash loss per delivery.
