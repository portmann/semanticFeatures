Pick These 3 Stocks Over Disney To Profit From The Avengers And Star Wars | Seeking Alpha Both The Avengers: Age of Ultron and Star Wars: The Force Awakens are expected to break box office records and could each gross above $1.5 billion at the box office. Disney's studio entertainment segment remains a small portion of the overall company and these 2 movies will only add small incremental gains to the top and bottom lines. While the headline sounds bearish on Disney (NYSE: DIS ), I believe it is one of the best managed companies in the entire market and is one of my favorite long-term stocks. I've written how Disney can be a solid cornerstone for any portfolio for the next 20 years , but I'm also hesitate to buy in the $105-$110 range as it seems to be getting a bit ahead of itself and the slightest earnings miss or market downturn could create a great buying opportunity below $100. A lot of buzz has been going around about Avengers: Age of Ultron and Star Wars: The Force Awakens smashing box office records. However, I believe there are a number of companies out there that will benefit far greater than Disney on this success. Disney's studio division, Buena Vista, has been tremendously successful over the past 3 years. Since 2012, the studio has achieved more than $1.5 billion in annual domestic box office sales. In 2014, studio revenue increased 22% to $7.3 billion, but still only accounted for 15% of total company revenue. Source: Disney Fiscal Year end results Over the past 3 years, Buena Vista has only accounted for 13%-15% of total company revenue and only 6%-12% of total company operating income. The company's most successful movie in the company's history was the 1st Avengers movie, which was released on 5/4/2012. The movie grossed $1.5 billion in world-wide box office sales, but still didn't have a significant impact on the company's top or bottom line. The new Avenger's movie and Star Wars movie will likely surpass $1.5 billion in total box office sales, but the question remains how much the movies will directly add to revenue and income. Even assuming a 20% increase in studio entertainment revenue in FY 2015 (which won't include Star Wars) over FY 2014 along with a 7% rise in total revenue, studio revenue will still only account for 16.7% of total revenue. While some may argue these new movie franchises will also increase consumer product revenue, it's important to note this segment historically accounts for roughly 8% of total revenue and around 10% of total operating income. So while the new Avenger's and Star Wars movie will definitely add to company revenue, it shouldn't be counted on to be a game changer for Disney. Investors shouldn't expect more than a couple hundred basis point improvement to revenue from these 2 movies in FY 2015 and FY 2016. At the end of the day the real money maker for Disney remains its media networks (ABC and ESPN) and theme parks, which account for a combined 75% of total revenue and operating income. I've written extensively over the past several months how movie theater operators like Cinemark (NYSE: CNK ), AMC Entertainment (NYSE: AMC ), National CineMedia (NASDAQ: NCMI ) and other movie theater operators are poised to move higher in 2015. Since the start of 2015, these stocks have significantly outperformed the broader market and will likely do so through the rest of the year. 2014 was a down year for movie theater operators and related stocks due to a weak movie line-up and declining box office sales. However, the YTD outperformance at the box office has led to renewed strength. While 2014 domestic box office sales declined 5.2%, YTD 2015 sales are up 3.6% year-over-year going into the release of the Avenger's movie. By the end of next weekend domestic box office sales should be up more than 5% and sales could be up by more than 10% over 2014 if both Avenger's and Star Wars are received well by audiences. A 10% increase would put 2015 box office sales at $11.4 billion, which isn't out of the realm of possibility. So while Disney may see a top and bottom line increase by 1.5%-3% from Avengers and Star Wars, movie theater operators will likely see their admission revenue grow by 10%-15%, as well as revenue from concessions to grow another 10%-15%. To benefit from the direct impact of the strong potential of the Avengers, Star Wars, and the remaining 2015 movie line-up, I believe Cinemark, AMC Entertainment and IMAX (NYSE: IMAX ) will outperform Disney over the next 8 months. At nearly $110/share Disney is looking expensive and because it has steadily appreciated toward the opening of the Avengers, the limited impact from the movie doesn't leave much upside potential through the rest of 2015. It's P/E value, which is nearing 25, and is at a 10 year high. Cinemark is and has been my favorite pick, because it has some of the highest margins in the industry and has a history of outperforming the overall domestic box office. In 2014, the company outpaced the domestic market by 180 basis points. When you add this outperformance to an operating margin of 14.5% and net income margin of 7.5%, the company sets up extremely well to leverage its earnings potential on the backs of Avengers and Star Wars. AMC Entertainment has the largest market share in the top 3 markets (NY, LA, CHI), as well as 6 of the top 10 highest grossing theaters in the US. AMC has been investing heavily into a growing theme of providing a luxury movie experience with comfortable recliners and full dinner and beverage options. Once you've been spoiled with a beer and delicious food at a movie, it's hard to go back to the older more traditional theaters. AMC understands movie-goers don't want to pay $10-$12 per ticket to sit in a cramped and over crowded theater. AMC now has 53 locations with reseated theaters to include "plush power recliners", 15 dine-in-theaters with a full menu, 75 locations that serve beer, wine and cocktails, 147 theaters that house an IMAX screen (the largest in North America), and RealD (NYSE: RLD ) 3D capability in all theaters. In addition, the company has been able to improve its operating margin over the past quarter, which now sits above 8%. IMAX may be the biggest beneficiary of Avengers and Star Wars. There's no reason to see Taken 3, Chappie, or any other run of the mill movie in IMAX, but when a blockbuster like Avengers or Star Wars comes to theaters, most movie-goers are willing to spend a few extra dollars to see the most anticipated films of the year in the highest quality possible. The company has built up a solid domestic and international presence with more than 934 theatres in 57 countries with more than 397 total theaters in backlog. IMAX also had a 2014 operating margins close to 20%, which far exceeds the standard more traditional movie theater operators. No one can logically argue that any of these movie theater operators are better long-term investments than Disney, but over the next 8-12 months I expect these picks to outperform the media and entertainment giant. At $110 Disney is looking expensive and the company's top and bottom line will only see small incremental gains from the successful launches of Avengers and Star Wars. For investors looking to profit directly from the success of these two movies, I suggest investing in Cinemark, AMC Entertainment or IMAX. All three of these picks are direct beneficiaries and their entire revenue structure is weighted to their success.
