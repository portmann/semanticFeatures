Apple's Currency Index Turns A New Page In Its Financial Results - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in AAPL over the next 72 hours. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. Apple created and showed a currency index to explain its low year-over-year revenue growth. This currency index is effectively the inverse of the real trade-weighted U.S. dollar index as measured against a broad basket of currencies. This new page in Apple's financial reporting highlights the company's increasingly difficult macro-economic environment. The company is clearly not ready to declare any trends have become entrenched and is instead focused on muscling through "short-term volatility.". Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) reported Q1 2016 earnings that disappointed the market. The negative reaction was consistent with the Apple earnings trading model . This time around, I took particular interest in Apple's accounting for the impact of currency fluctuations on its results. Apple went to great lengths to explain the out-sized impact on its business from currency fluctuations. The company used a "Currency Index" that turns a new page in the reporting of Apple's financial results. The numbers show how Apple's story has become increasingly dependent on growth from outside of the Americas and the U.S. in particular. AAPL provided a supplemental document to describe the impact of currencies on its results. The big story: for every non-US based dollar Apple earned in Q4 2014, it now only earns 85 cents. A bar chart of this effect would have made individual quarters more clear and distinct, but Apple's line format certainly emphasizes the decline in Apple's international earning power from currency moves. For context and perspective, I also include a monthly chart of the real trade-weighted U.S. dollar using a broad basket of currencies. Apple's global revenue power as expressed in the company's Currency Index is really all about the strength of the U.S. dollar index (NYSEARCA: UUP ).

On a constant currency basis, Apple's year-over-year revenue growth moves from 2% to 8%. The biggest adjustments come from Europe, Japan, and Asia ex-Japan and ex-Greater China. Source: Apple Q1 2016 earnings supplemental Of course, Apple cannot impress investors with constant currency results. This is asking for an asymmetric handicap: there is no rush to demonstrate a comprehensive adjustment when the dollar is much weaker. I am guessing there is a direct correlation between the extra effort put into explaining currency effects and the very low, single-digit year-over-year growth. As the graph shows, the currency impact is not a one-time cost Apple can "write-off." These currency moves are an on-going operational reality that appear to have taken on their own momentum and trend. Moreover, most (U.S.) investors cannot or will not purchase currency hedges in order to capture Apple's constant currency results. The stagnant revenue growth in the Americas and Japan really sticks out in the above chart. Apple's incremental growth deeply depends on the health of international markets. The Bank of Japan's recent descent into negative rate territory has highlighted the perilous condition of the global growth story. The path forward for Apple may increasingly depend on international customers viewing Apple products as must-haves despite all manner of economic churn. Here is how CEO Tim Cook described the situation according to the transcript from Seeking Alpha (emphasis mine): "Our results are particularly impressive, given the challenging global macroeconomic environment. We're seeing extreme conditions unlike anything we've experienced before just about everywhere we look. Major markets, including Brazil, Russia, Japan, Canada, Southeast Asia, Australia, Turkey and the eurozone, have been impacted by slowing economic growth, falling commodity prices and weakening currencies… 66% of Apple's revenue is now generated outside the United States, so foreign currency fluctuations have a very meaningful impact on our results… $100 of Apple's non-U.S. dollar revenue in Q4 of 2014 translated to only $85 last quarter due to the weakening currencies in our international markets. As you can see, the movement has been dramatic. Last quarter alone, the currency impact has been very large… The 8% growth rate I spoke about earlier translates to $80.8 billion in constant currency revenue, which is $5 billion more than our reported revenue. For perspective, that difference is about the size of the annual revenue of a Fortune 500 company." Cook went on to note that Apple's results in China were still showing momentum at a time last summer when many other companies were experiencing weakness. Even the last quarter was strong in China. The December quarter "…produced our best results ever in Greater China, with revenue growing 14% over last year, 47% sequentially, and 17% year-over-year in constant currency. These great results were fueled by our highest ever quarterly iPhone sales and record App Store performance." However, Apple's immunity to the region's malaise may be running thin. Apple "…began to see some signs of economic softness in Greater China earlier this month, most notably in Hong Kong." Cook moved on from here to continue discussing Apple's strengths and accomplishments. Cook avoided commenting on whether a new trend is now in place. Instead, he dismissed the current conditions as "short-term volatility." In the Q&A session he reassured analysts that Apple has not changed the pace of its expansion and investments in China. Of course, a company with Apple's muscle can afford to continue full-speed ahead; Apple has a LOT of buffer. Cook also pointed to an upgrade cycle from 3G phones and once again paid homage to the buying power of China's burgeoning middle class. Time will tell what shape Apple is in after it leverages its financial and product acumen to power through short-term volatility. APPL declined sharply in response to these earnings. The stock lost over 6% on the day. While the stock is still a broken stock given the decline in all its major moving averages (20, 50, and 200-day), it is certainly possible that a lot of the fear of the bad news spent itself going into and through earnings. Apple participated in Friday's big rally day to the tune of an impressive 3.4% gain on above average trading volume. These gains are already eating into Apple's post-earnings loss. Apple has pointed a bright spotlight on currency issues impacting its business in an attempt to maintain the luster of the good news underneath. Investors may now get a preview of Apple's (real) results by checking on the quarter's broad change in the U.S. dollar and the collective churn in individual currencies in Apple's major markets. Macro-economics, particularly as expressed through currency movements, have forced Apple to turn a new page in its financial reporting.
