BlackBerry And CEO John Chen Play Poker In China - BlackBerry Ltd. (NASDAQ:BBRY) | Seeking Alpha BlackBerry's CEO John Chen previously balked on entering China. He feared that having to share sensitive data would alienate Western authorities. Chen was actually playing poker. BlackBerry needs a presence in China, but does not want to sacrifice security. Lenovo is losing market share in China and it may have to align itself with BlackBerry out of necessity. Lenovo is a local Chinese manufacturer and the government is known for shepherding home-grown companies. As the largest smartphone market, China is important to any smartphone manufacturer. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) are two foreigners who have cracked the Chinese market, but BlackBerry (NASDAQ: BBRY ) ... not so much. In October BlackBerry CEO John Chen visited the Asia/Pacific region on a marketing mission. I thought Chen would wow them in China for a few reasons, one which was the Edward Snowden Effect: The Edward Snowden Effect put a global focus on security, which played to BlackBerry's strengths; Chen is on record saying that BlackBerry would not lose the fight on security ... With the Chinese government's focus on security, BlackBerry should be a hit with government officials, corporations that need to share confidential information over a secure platform, and potentially with consumers. During his visit Chen met with the heads of Xiaomi and Lenono ( OTCPK:LNVGY ), ( OTCPK:LNVGF ) about potential partnering arrangements . However, out of concern that having to share sensitive data with the Chinese government would alienate Western authorities , Chen left the region without a distribution deal in place: In FQ4 BlackBerry reported revenue of $660, off 17% from the $794 million the market was expecting. Particularly alarming was that hardware revenue of $277 million was down 23% sequentially and 23% Y/Y. The company recognized revenue on 1.3 million, off 35% from the 2 million sold in the previous quarter. The one positive was that the average sales price ("asp") was $211 versus $180 in FQ3: Naysayers point to BlackBerry's declining ecosystem. However, no company can both be a leading smartphone manufacturer and cede China, which represented about 32% of the global smartphone market in 2014. In August of last year Apple may have circumvented the security issue by deciding to store user data on servers in Mainland China. Apple made this decision right before the launch of its iPhone 6, which became the biggest smartphone launch in history; Apple received 20 million pre-orders for the phablet in China alone. BlackBerry decided against providing the Chinese government access to users' data. However, consumers nor Western authorities have rewarded BlackBerry in the form of additional smartphone purchases. In reality Chen is playing poker. Of course he would like for BlackBerry to have presence in China. When he said "I don't want to get sucked into a geopolitical equation," what I heard was, "China is too big of a market for BlackBerry to ignore, but we would like to have a presence there on our terms." That said, the success of the iPhone 6 and Samsung's Galaxy S6 - estimated to have garnered 20 million pre-orders - may provide BlackBerry the leverage it needs. According to Statista, Xiaomi increased its Q4 2014 market share in China from 7% to 15% Y/Y, while Apple's increased from 7% to 12%. Their gains came out of the hides of Lenovo and Samsung. Samsung has struck back with its Galaxy S6. According to TrendForce Samsung increased its global share by over three percentage points in Q1; share for Apple and Lenovo declined by about three percentage points and one percentage point, respectively. In my opinion there are three moats in the smartphone industry - [i] dominance on the low-end of the market, [ii] dominance in the premium segment, and [iii] dominance in security. Lenovo and Xiaomi dominate the low-end, Apple dominates the premium segment, and BlackBerry is dominant in security. In my opinion, BlackBerry needs to be in China to jumpstart smartphone sales. Coincidentally, there may also be a need for BlackBerry in China. Lenovo, who has previously been linked to BlackBerry, could be forced to align with BlackBerry for the following reasons: As more of the Chinese market moves upscale, Lenovo's moat could be weakening. According to Seeking Alpha author Mark Hibben , dominance in the low-end may still not insulate vendors from Apple's reach: According to Cook, the rapid expansion of the middle class in China is what's fueling Apple iPhone sales. As people become more affluent, they are tossing their white-box Android phones for something more upscale. Apple has intelligently positioned itself as that upscale alternative ... Rather than going downmarket, Apple is letting the market come to it. The overall China smartphone market is not growing as rapidly as it once was. In November Levono even admitted that hypergrowth in China smartphones was ending. If China's smartphone industry growth is stagnant, and Apple is increasing its market share, that share has to come out of somebody else's hide. Right now that appears to be Lenovo's. With its market share in decline in its home country, Lenovo may be forced to attempt to rekindle a potential alliance with BlackBerry. Playing up the security angle could be a differentiator. The government could potentially let BlackBerry keep its security features if it means making a local vendor more competitive. That said, if or when BlackBerry returns to China, it could be on its own terms. Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
