The Fault In Apple's Star - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple might have to kill its iAd platform or go all-in and be as intense as Google when it comes to mobile advertising. A focus on mobile advertising might be more viable than online TV subscriptions. The lucrative hardware focus of Apple cannot last forever. I am very happy with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) owning more than 85% of operating profits on smartphones. However, we should not forget that the overall mobile industry is not limited to selling hardware. Apple's growth prospects could be better if it starts focusing on mobile advertising. The chart below highlights just how profitable Apple's hardware-focused business is. However, I have made it very clear that Apple has an Achilles heel in iAd. While Apple enjoys massive profitability with its iOS devices, it continues to let rival Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) rake in billions of dollars from delivering ads to iPhone and iPad users. Since Apple cannot ban Google and Facebook's apps from monetizing iPhone and iPad users, the long-term scenario is that Apple will remain a non-factor in mobile advertising. Marketing research firm eMarketer's chart below shows Apple's iAd platform is still a failure more than four years after the late Steve Jobs launched it. My point is that Apple has zero percent market share in global mobile advertising sales in spite it having a 14.8% share in global shipments of smartphones. Other Firms Are Mining The Advertising Cash Cow in iOS. Making massive profits in hardware should not blind Apple to the fact that other companies are riding on the success of the iOS ecosystem. Apple shareholders are not getting the best return on their money because the supposedly walled-in ecosystem of Apple is not closed at all when it comes to mobile advertising. Third-party advertisers and/or ad providers like Facebook could milk iPhone users through app-install adverts. Advertisers firmly believe that iPhone users are more valuable than their Android counterparts. Google and Facebook can therefore charge advertisers higher fees to deliver ads to iOS users than what they charge on Android. App developers love advertising on iOS Facebook apps because iPhone users are more likely to click and install the advertised apps. A Majority of iPhone users belong to higher economic classes and can afford Apple's high-margin pricing. Consequently, while Apple takes in a 30% commission on app purchases, I speculate that Apple doesn't get a share from Facebook-delivered ads. Mobile advertising is a continuing missed opportunity for Apple. Apple is better off improving its iAd platform rather than engaging in paid TV subscriptions. Mobile advertising is already a $64.25 billion industry this year and it will grow to $159 billion by 2018. Even Tim Cook's decision to lower the Apple TV's price to $69 will still not be enough to match the already existing number of iPhone users. Even if Cook recruits more content providers like HBO, the Apple TV is also unlikely to match the annual sales volume of the iPhone. Unlike the hefty multi-billion opportunity in mobile advertising, the Apple TV concept is limited. Apple has sold 700 million iPhones but only 25 million Apple TVs. Apple's TV is also no longer the number one smart TV in the U.S. Roku and Google's Chromecast are outselling the Apple TV in America. Statista predicts that there will be more than 759 million units of connected TV sets in the world by 2018. However, the global online TV/Video industry will only be worth $35 billion by year 2018, less than half of mobile advertising's 2018 numbers. Apple TV has little chance of even getting 10% of the 2018 predicted subscription TV revenue of $12.98 billion. Roku, Xiaomi, Google, and even Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) has cheap smart TV products that will make it hard for the $69 Apple TV to improve on its 10 million unit sales in 2013. Apple already failed in iAd on the iPhone and iPad so the $16.4 billion in online TV ads is also a no-go for Apple. I continue to reiterate my Buy rating for Apple. However, the fault in Apple's star might be that it cannot avoid its fate as a loser in mobile advertising. Worse, the fault in iAds' star is that Apple will either have to give away all user data to advertisers, or let the iAd platform die. The success of Google and Facebook is due to their willingness to share comprehensive user data to third-party advertisers. Tim Cook has repeatedly lowered the fees in iAd but advertisers still shun it because of Cook's hardline stance against data mining and data sharing. Cook allowed programmatic ads on iAds last year. Programmatic advertising is now also available on iTunes Radio . However, programmatic advertising or automated real-time bidding for ad placements is only truly effective if advertisers and ad providers get as much data as possible from targeted users. Google became the king in digital and mobile advertising because there is no limit to its information gathering on people. The programmatic ad services over iTunes Radio only allows advertisers to tailor their ads according to a target user's email address and phone number. Pandora's (NYSE: P ) advertising platform allows marketers to deliver ads based on age, gender, location, ZIP code, band affinity and musical taste. Cook's dilemma now is that if he allows Apple to share complete data of the 600 million iTunes users, he risks alienating the people who paid a lot of money to own the iPhone because they like the privacy settings of iOS. However, quitting or limiting its involvement in the mobile advertising business (in favor of preserving the loyalty of privacy-freak iPhones users) might also endanger Apple's long-term growth. The future of the mobile industry is increasingly becoming more about winning the most number of users, not about getting the most hardware profits. While Apple can continue to enjoy its niche in high-priced smartphones, the long-term scenario is that other smartphone vendors will eventually force Apple to also lower its iPhone's average selling price. The race-to-the-bottom trend among Android smartphone manufacturers is now exacerbated by Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) aggressive push for $70 Lumia Windows 8.1 phones. MSFT CEO Satya Nadella no longer prioritizes hardware. The mighty resources of Microsoft are now focused on getting the most amount of mobile users for its new freemium strategy . Another fault in Apple's star therefore is that it cannot avoid a future where it can no longer enforce a $400 operating margin on every new iPhone. This decline in average selling price has already happened with the iPad. As the race-to-the-bottom pricing intensifies among Android and Windows phone vendors, Apple's iPhone pricing will also get lower. Otherwise, the disparity between an iPhone and Android phone will just grow too big for consumers to ignore. Android phone vendors like Asus ( OTC:ASUUY ) and Xiaomi can already come up with a high-end sub- $350 Android phones with the same or better hardware specs than a $700 iPhone. After implementing the bigger displays of the iPhone 6, Apple has no other compelling excuse to increase the average selling prices of its next iPhones. The pressure from Xiaomi and Asus will force Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) to also lower the prices of its flagship Galaxy phones. Microsoft is now focused on entry-level phones, but after it releases Windows 10 this summer, it might also start releasing $350 high-end phones . Disclosure: The author is long AAPL, MSFT, INTC, FB.
