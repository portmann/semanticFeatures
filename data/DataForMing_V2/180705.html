Yahoo Looking Quite Compelling Again - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha Fall over Alibaba concerns may provide an opportunity. Share repurchases likely to pick up at lower levels. One of the worst performing stocks recently has been Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ), which has lost a quarter of its value in the past three months. The stock's fall has been mostly due to its substantial stake in Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ), which has lost nearly half of its value from its post-IPO high. Back near $30 a share, Yahoo is looking quite compelling once again. Yahoo is looking to unload its Alibaba stake in the most tax efficient manner. Part of Yahoo's fall is due to concerns that the IRS may not approve a tax-free spinoff, which would result in a significant tax bill. Recently, some comments from an IRS executive led one analyst to be incrementally positive on the situation. FBR analyst William Bird thinks recent statements take one risk off the table, which is the retroactive treatment of potential new rules. While the analyst did cut his price target on Yahoo from $50 to $39, his current target represents significant upside from where Yahoo shares currently trade. MKM also cut its target to $43 based on the potential decision, but that's even higher than Bird's price. Yahoo's stake in Alibaba was worth around $23.8 billion as of Monday's close. With Yahoo itself having a market cap of just $28.6 billion, the rest of Yahoo after its Yahoo Japan stake may have a value of negative $2 billion or so if you assume a tax-free spinoff. Even if the IRS ruling is unfavorable to Yahoo, you could still make a case for Yahoo shares being worth what they are now. With Yahoo shares falling more than 42% from their 52-week high, I would expect management to be very active in repurchasing shares. Yahoo had about $7 billion in cash on the balance sheet at the end of Q2 , giving it plenty of financial flexibility to step in while share prices are low. Yahoo had more than 1.2 billion shares outstanding at the end of 2011. At the end of Q2, that number was below 940 million, and if management really steps in, Yahoo could get under 900 million by the end of this year. Over time, this will continue to help EPS as the share count is dramatically reduced. Yahoo is starting to make strides in mobile, and I believe some of its recent efforts will really pay off next year. However, investors need to be clear on the top-line picture, as some numbers can be misleading . One of the areas where I think Yahoo will be really successful is its daily fantasy sports platform. While the company has to battle against a few established players in the space, over time I believe Yahoo can generate significant revenues. Daily games have become very popular, and Yahoo will start to gain more traction as NBA and NHL seasons start. A recent article states that Yahoo is losing money so far on its daily fantasy activity , and I think that's okay right now. Given where Yahoo stands in the space, the company probably needs to spend a bit in the first few months post-launch to get its platform going. Over time as more players come in, spending should decrease, and profitability will start. Now is the time to rack up losses, as analysts are already forecasting a huge drop in non-GAAP EPS this year. At this point, I'd rather see profits shrink further this year, setting the company up for a rebound in 2016. With Yahoo shares down big recently and the Alibaba cloud hanging over the stock, the situation seems ripe for an activist to come in. This is especially true if the IRS ruling is unfavorable, because Yahoo would then need to make a big decision on its Alibaba holding. With such a large cash position, it wouldn't surprise me if someone like Carl Icahn bought up a chunk of shares in an effort to turn things around. If the spinoff doesn't come and results continue to struggle, an activist may argue for leadership change. I stated earlier this year that Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer could be the next tech leader to go. Mayer has been at the helm for more than three years now, and is Yahoo better off? She received a lot of praise thanks to Yahoo shares soaring on its Alibaba stake, but now Yahoo is falling due to Alibaba. Yahoo shares have fallen to $30, where I think they become rather interesting again. The latest IRS comments appear slightly more positive, and the company's buyback should really speed up at these levels. While daily fantasy sports might be losing money currently, I think the platform will help the top and bottom line significantly going forward. Should the next month or two not go so well, it would not surprise me if a big activist stepped in and tried to shake things up a bit. I think that Yahoo could be one of the market's biggest winners over the next year, even if the Alibaba spinoff doesn't go exactly as planned.
