Verizon looks at asset-backed financing to shift customer cash up front - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha Mar  8 2016, 12:08 ET | About: Verizon Communications (VZ) | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Verizon ( VZ +0.8%) is considering a plan to shift to asset-backed receivable financing , a move that could get it more cash up front but require it to shop overseas for a deal. The move would get cash in advance to Verizon from customers who are financing their devices, says CFO Fran Shammo. The company may need a foreign bank to provide the financing, Shammo says, as it's slim pickings for this kind of financing in the U.S. The wireless spectrum auction beginning March 29 is going to make heavy cash demands on its bidders, who'll need to pay quickly after it wraps. Verizon bid $10.4B in last year's AWS-3 auction; it's expected to bid some $6.2B in this month's incentive auction. VZ has been doing this in another form for years.  For customers on auto-pay, VZ withdraws funds from their accounts ten (10) days before the actual due date.  I find that outrageous, and I'm informed that the DOJ is about to land on VZ over this practice.  They really are chiselers at VZ.  Shame on em.
