Twitter: The Growth Misperception - Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) | Seeking Alpha Investors have a misperception that Twitter is a slow growth company. Twitter had the fastest growth rate of any tech stock its size. So many investors spend their time focusing on the user base of Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) versus Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) that the growth and valuation is misunderstood. Most investors focus on Twitter not having the user ramp similar to Facebook, but at the same time miss that in reality the company has market leading revenue growth. Since everything in the market is relative over the long term, investors need to keep in mind that Twitter is only worth nearly $25 billion and Facebook is over $275 billion. The difference is massive and no longer indicative of companies that should be compared outside of arm's length. In the article " Twitter: Still Cheaper Than You Think ," the case was made for catalysts that make the stock appealing at these levels. This article will focus on the misperception of the growth of the company relative to other tech stocks and primarily Facebook. The most common comparison of the two companies is the amount of active monthly users. Facebook leads in this category by a long shot with Q1 '15 MAUs topping 1.44 billion. Twitter weighed in at only 302 million, or 308 million if including the fast dial users from emerging markets like India. Using quick math, one can see that Facebook has nearly 5x the users on the core sites. The stock though is worth more than 10x the valuation of Twitter. The key to the focus on the core sites is that those are the only ones that generated material revenue for either company. Over the next five years, both will compete with secondary sites such as Instagram versus Periscope. Though the market constantly slams Twitter for the lack of users matching Facebook, it isn't like the core Facebook site is growing at any fast rate with MAUs only up 13% for Q1. Mostly investors review the revenue growth and the user growth of the non-core sites of Instagram and WhatsApp to extrapolate positive long-term growth. With Twitter, investors take the faster revenue growth and ignore it due to the meager user growth of the core site. The question is whether a hot live-streaming app like Periscope will give the company that carrot to rally momentum investors. For Q1, Twitter had 302 million users for an 18% growth rate over last year. Notice how the Twitter user base is actually growing faster than the core Facebook. While investors can debate the focus on user metrics, the actual revenue numbers aren't debatable. Twitter has some of the highest revenue growth rates in the market, as the social media company continues to ramp up monetization of traffic. Analysts forecast Twitter Q2 revenue growth of 54% versus only 37% for Facebook. For 2016, Twitter again wins with 48% growth rates versus only 34% for Facebook. Twitter is the clear winner based on these metrics, which of course could change with actual numbers. It is very possible that Facebook closes that gap if Twitter again disappoints. Without a permanent CEO, Twitter might struggle to maintain that fast revenue growth. Moving beyond the comparison to just Facebook, Twitter had the fastest revenue growth rates of tech companies with market caps above $22 billion. The past isn't always indicative of future growth and some of these numbers don't actually capture pro-forma numbers that accurately account for acquisitions and divestments. As an example, Avago Technologies (NASDAQ: AVGO ) was removed from the below chart because the data showed 100% revenue growth due to a merger. The key is that the chart above highlights the misperception of Twitter. It is constantly viewed in the light of user growth instead of the actual improvements in the financials where it leads the large-cap tech sector. Twitter probably won't ever be Facebook, but it doesn't mean that the stock won't close the valuation gap. The market has a misperception that Facebook is somehow growing at a faster rate than Twitter, but that isn't the case with users or revenue. The great wild card is whether the popularity of the Periscope app can reinvigorate the stock and grab some of that momentum that Facebook obtains from other sites like Instagram. The stock will be volatile the rest of 2015 as the search for a permanent CEO unfolds, but Twitter is in a much better position to head higher than the market perceives.
