Disney: Now Is Not The Time To Panic - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha DIS has been crushed in the last couple of trading sessions on concerns over its TV business. ESPN is losing subscribers and that is a problem but it is being blown out of proportion by investors. I'm taking a wait and see approach on the TV business but assertions that DIS is a short are unfounded. Entertainment giant Disney (NYSE: DIS ) has been one of my favorite long positions in the entire market for some time now. I've loved the company's ability to produce an ecosystem of entertainment content and capitalize on it in a huge way. But recently, the company's TV business has been called into question. The TV segment produces about half of the company's revenue and profits and crown jewel ESPN has been railroaded of late in terms of how many subscribers it may be losing. In addition, terrorism-related travel warnings are throwing cold water on the parks business so to say sentiment has weakened for Disney is an understatement. Given that my bullishness is predicated upon the TV and parks businesses continuing their recent performances, I'll take a fresh look at Disney here and address some of the recent criticism of the stock. First, I think angst over the parks business is overblown. Travel warnings are generally short-lived and I think Disney's ecosystem of desirable content is strong enough that the parks business will outlast any kind of temporary headwinds. Admittedly the parks business is rather small in the context of the whole company but it is an important piece of the puzzle. Doug Kass thinks demand will wane following a run up in ticket prices and that the parks business will suffer from the strong dollar and while there is no doubting the impact of the dollar, the parks business continues to attract millions of guests per year. Disney recently piloted demand-based ticket pricing because its parks are so full it is trying to spread demand out. That doesn't sound like a problem to me so it is pretty clear to me Kass is wrong about the parks. In addition to that, the company's studio business is plowing ahead with Star Wars on the horizon. Pre-sales of tickets have been through the roof and merchandising is so strong that Disney is roughly doubling its normal licensing fee on related products. Again, this is a sign of very strong demand, not weakening demand as others would suggest. More important than the actual results is the idea that the demand signaled by consumers on Disney's studio and content ecosystem bodes very well for the future. The other half of the business that isn't related to TV depends upon great content and Disney is proving the ability to continuously produce amazing content consumers are willing to pay for. On the TV side, the idea of skinny bundles should scare Disney investors. There is a small but growing movement of people that simply don't want to buy cable anymore and that is a serious problem for Disney in general but also ESPN. It has been a small problem so far but the potential is great for it to spiral out of control and for layoffs to become far more common. ESPN should be somewhat insulated because it provides live sports programming as opposed to scripted programming that can be viewed at any time but the fact is that ESPN is losing subscribers . Where the bottom is will prove to be unbelievably important but no one knows just yet where that is. I'll admit that despite my bullishness on Disney, I'm certainly concerned about the TV business. ESPN gets about $6.60 per subscriber per month so when millions of subscribers flee, it adds up very quickly. And with the cost of showcasing live sports programming skyrocketing over the years, ESPN is finding it harder and harder to produce operating income. At a time when revenue is falling the very last thing you can afford is for costs to go up and that is exactly what we're seeing now. I certainly don't think ESPN is dead because it provides a very important service to millions upon millions of loyal sports viewers but something has to give; it is locked into multi-year contracts with the major sports leagues to carry content and that is a problem given that those contracts were negotiated largely when subscriber numbers were larger than today and/or still growing. Those things are no longer the case and it makes me think layoffs at ESPN are potentially going to be more common. The other problem with lower subscriber numbers apart from monthly fees is lower advertising rates. ESPN is still the premium name in sports and will be for a long time to come but the simple fact is that if you're reaching fewer people, advertisers rightly won't pay as much. The daily fantasy sports leagues have also been heavy spenders of advertising dollars on ESPN networks of late but given the hot water they are in with various regulators, that well may dry up soon. Again, the prospect of lower advertising rates is minimal at this point but we don't know where the bottom is. Every business of Disney's is booming with the exception of the interactive business and TV. The interactive business is a small fraction of the overall company so I honestly don't even care what it does as it will not move the needle one way or the other. But the TV business is half of the company's revenue and profits, generally speaking, so when it sneezes, the consolidated company catches a cold. That is what we've seen this year with the reduction in growth estimates but analysts are still as bullish as ever, projecting higher EPS next year than they did three months ago. I find that interesting considering all the potential headwinds Disney could face in 2016. My personal feeling is that ESPN is not in a panic situation as many pundits and analysts are suggesting. Subscriber losses are painful but perhaps the losses will remain marginal. Perhaps the sky is not falling and that would mean that with the layoffs we recently saw from ESPN, the company could be sized properly at this point. Content costs are a big concern because ESPN needs the subscribers to pay those multi-billion dollar bills that are coming due in the near future but those will not change; the only wildcard here is subs and the advertising rates the company can charge. I get why investors are worried - I'm worried too - but I think at this point there is nowhere near enough information to suggest that Disney is a short by any means. I respect Doug Kass a great deal but I think he is wrong here; Disney's business has already absorbed the negative impacts of the moderate subscriber losses the company has experienced and it is time to move forward. If Disney reports accelerating sub losses for ESPN in 2016 all bets are off but for now, I don't think that is the right conclusion to draw. I'm still long Disney but keeping a keen eye on the TV business as now is not the time to panic. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
