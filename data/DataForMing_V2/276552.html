AmEx Special Offers: Amazon, Cell Phones, Hulu, Uber, Sports Authority, Etc. — My Money Blog December 29, 2015 By Jonathan Ping 33 Comments Reminder: Many top offers expiring 12/31/15. American Express cardholders can participate in “AmEx Offers” which offer discounts to various merchants.  These promotions often offer the opportunity for easy savings without changing your spending habits.   For places that I shop at regularly, I can often buy a gift card to lock in the savings.

Tweet #AmexEmbassy Each separate card, including authorized users, may have different offers available to them.  In addition, adding an offer to one card may remove the same offer from another card. Although as commenter Oleg notes “If you have multiple cards and you activated for an offer on one of them, this offer may disappear from others. You can open several [web browser] tabs, retrieve each card separately and apply for an offer.” Here are the various ways to access these offers: Access via social media at AmExOffers.com – Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare, and TripAdvisor. Not everyone can access every offer, but the ones on Twitter tend to be available to everyone.  You can track these on their Favorites page . Thanks for the heads-up!  My account also has $10 off $50 (3X) at grocery stores (says NJ NY CT only). I had a bunch of these; curious if anyone else is seeing the one Steve mentions above, either via AmEx directly or twitter/FB. thanks for the tip. checked my account, saw lots of offers including the ones mentioned above…alas I rarely shop, but might be able to use the Ticketmaster offer (for US Open tennis tickets) just wanted to update everyone. I used my Amex at Whole Foods wine store (where prices are actually reasonable, not Trader Joes like, but reasonable), and qualified for $10 off $50 supermarket purchase.  Minutes after the transaction they sent an email confirmation, and credited the $10 within 2 business days to my account. Consider me impressed. Does anyone know, does the purchase have to be all at once to get the credit, or could I  spend 40$ at Homedepot one week, and then another 40$ the next? Purchase must be all at once for this promo.    It may be easier to just buy a Home Depot gift card if you need to spread out the purchases. Today I went to the HD @ Charlotte, NC and when I tried to buy HD gift card, the manager says that they got a memo from Atlanta that for all gift cards, they would take only Check or Cash but no Credit Card. Nvtech, you can always buy their gift card online. Credit cards are accepted there, no need to argue with crazy store managers who come up with these self-invented policies. Just thought I’d post a little tip, something I learned from experience – if you have more than one user on your Amex card, be aware that each card has a different number, and has to be activated for an offer separately. I discovered this when my wife made a purchase but we didn’t get the credit for the offer, because SHE hadn’t activated it on HER card, even though they both are on the same account. If you have multiple cards and you activated for an offer on one of them, this offer may disappear from others. You can open several tabs, retrieve each card separately and apply for an offer. Doh, I read your post too late.  What if I activated an offer on one card and the offer has already disappeared from my other card?  Any way to get it back?  Would twitter and fb and the amex website have different offers or are they all the same (for the same person)? Victoria, I believe once you click there is no way back. Although the offer still could be available on facebook and twitter. Corporate cards are usually issued by large companies of 50+ employees.  All of the Corporate cards I have used have been clearly marked on the front.   They are not the same as small business cards, which do indeed work with these special offers. Through the account page, under the “offer for you”, I also grabbed a $10 credit for a $10 or more purchase on Amazon.com.  That’s just a no brainer.  Grab it if it’s available… Also, Smart&Final sell several store gift cards (including Amazon, Macys, etc), and the fine print does not seem to exclude it. If you have nothing else to buy, you can just get three $50 Amazon cards in different transactions Just did the Smart & Final offer.  We were gonna be buying a bunch of flights through Southwest for the summer… well Amex just gave us $225 in free airfare as they have $50 gift cards at Smart & Final.  ? Did not received any of the above offers on Amex.  Called and yes, they said that this is definitely targeted – so interesting since we use Amex for everything, if the place of business takes it.   After 15 years will be saying “hasta la vista” when Costco doesn’t take it anymore. I use AT&T Uverse for TV.  I signed up for both the TV and the phone offers, not knowing which one it would trigger. I received two e-mail notifications for using the card once. Wonder if I’ll get a double bonus… Did you charge $75? If so, it might trigger both bonuses like you speculated. I might try the same with Fios. Thanks.  Got the Amazon one.  Nice.  Did the GC as we’ll spend $60 at amazon for sure in the next mont… week. Does anyone know if its possible to get these offers on the Fidelity Amex Card?  I login and don’t see the offers anywhere on their website. Neither I nor my wife got the Amazon or Verizon offers.  In fact, the majority of offers we received were with companies we’ve never heard of, which might be the purpose of the offers. I clicked through to read the details of the cell phone deal and was disappointed to find it won’t  work for me: “Payments for prepaid cell phone purchases, plans or services do not qualify. “ Notify me of follow-up comments by email.
