Intel's Mac Business Will Thrive In Spite Of The A9X Processor/iPad Pro - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Tim Cook is wrong to say the new iPad Pro could replace PCs. The incompatibility of the iPad Pro with x86 Mac-only productivity software says Intel will continue to enjoy long-term benefits from sales of Mac computers. Any x86 Intel processor that can run different operating systems and software, will continue to be more useful/versatile than ARM-based chips like the A9X. With all due respect, I strongly disagree with the claim of Timothy Arcuri (analyst from Cowen and Company) that the A9X processor Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) uses on the iPad Pro is a threat to Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ). Arcuri's argument that the A9X has better benchmark scores than the Intel Core M used in the MacBook is not evidence that Intel's Mac business is threatened. Arcuri's speculation is important because the Mac division now generates more revenue for Apple than the iPad division. Any suggestion of Apple abandoning Intel-made processors for its Mac computers deserves to be quashed immediately. Investors and analysts should understand that the impressive CPU/GPU benchmark scores of the A9X are useless for business/professional users who rely on x86-only Mac software. Arcuri conveniently forgot that even the Office 365 for the iOS platform is a greatly watered-down version. It doesn't even offer 30% of the features found inside Office for Mac . My point is that ARM-based processors are at a great disadvantage because they cannot offer the same desktop PC-level productivity. This is because the codes used in CISC (Complex Instruction Set of Computers) x86-based productivity software (like Office for Mac 2016 and Photoshop) are difficult to re-compile or translate to run on the limited Reduced Instruction Set of Computers (RISC) instruction set of ARM-based chips like the three-core A9X. Tim Cook's claim that an iPad Pro could replace business computers was just a sales pitch to pump up public interest. Multiple hands-on reviews are saying the iPad Pro is not an existentialist threat to laptops or desktop Macs. This is something I always argued for - the iPad Pro is just a companion (not replacement) device for Mac-using people. Intel's lucrative business of supplying high-margin Core i5 and Core i7 chips to Mac computers faces little risk from the release of the iPad Pro. Unless Apple can find a way to create a 1:1 copy of Photoshop CC to work on the Reduced Instruction Set of Computers (RISC) limitation of the A9X, Intel will continue to receive x86 processor purchase orders for MacBooks. Let us not forget that the growth of Mac sales was largely due to Apple shifting from RISC PowerPC chips to Intel's x86 processors. Arcuri's theory that A9X could replace Intel-made processors on Apple-branded computers is a big step backward. Apple dumped RISC PowerPC processors precisely because it wanted its Macs to be compatible with more x86-only software. The high-end MacBook Pro and Mac Pro computers, which uses Core i7 and Core i5 Intel processors, will always be more powerful and useful than any ARM-based iPad Pro. Another reason to dismiss the thought that Apple will abandon Intel processors for Mac computers is Apple itself. Apple continues to stick to its "product differentiation" policy that Mac OS and iOS devices will always be built as standalone products. The ARM-based A9X chip cannot obviously run Mac OS (and the software related to it). Apple will therefore continue to rely on Intel to keeps it high-margin Mac business competitive. The iPad Pro only allows for Apple to sell it to Mac-using customers that want a touchscreen-friendly gadget for their Mac OS X-only software like Photoshop or Final Cut Pro. Market appeal of the pricey Intel-less iPad Pro is likely going to be weak. It has limited total addressable market because the A9X will never be able to run important industry-standard or custom enterprise x86 software. Tim Cook's touting of the alleged PC-killer potential of the iPad Pro did not exactly generate much interest from social/web communities. Online interest over the iPad Pro has significantly dropped from September to the November 11 official commercial launch. If we look at the chart from TickerTags , the 'iPad Pro' buzz word/term is no longer a hot topic like it was last September 8. The weak social interest in the ARM-based iPad Pro during its commercial launch week favors my assertion that it is unlikely to cannibalize sales of Intel-powered MacBooks. It makes sense, as the pricey iPad Pro has inferior business-centric usability when compared to the similarly-priced Surface Pro 4 (or other Windows 10 tablet/notebook products). Even my $200 Cherry Mobile Alpha Morph 2-in-1 Windows notebook, which only has an old dual-core Intel Atom Z3375D SOC, is more useful than the A9X-powered iPad Pro. INTC is a Buy. Investors should not worry too much about Arcuri's exaggerated perception of the RISC A9X chip. It is not and will never be a serious threat to the Mac-centric processor sales of Intel. Tim Cook is also wrong to say that iPad Pro could seriously replace PCs. On the contrary, my prediction is that if the experimental iPad Pro fails to achieve enough commercial success, Tim Cook might just release a touchscreen-friendly MacBook. This is the only way that Apple can properly neutralize the growing popularity of the Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Surface 2-in-1 laptop among enterprise users and creative professionals.
