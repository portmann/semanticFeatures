An Apple Hacker apple bug bounty bugs security researchers Looking For Bugs paying for information hack attack Between iPhones, iPads, Mac computers, and other devices, hundreds of millions of people have sensitive personal information stored on Apple products. In an effort to ensure this info and other data remains secure, Apple has joined the ranks of companies publicly offering bug bounties to hackers who find and alert Apple of security flaws. Apple unveiled the bug bounty program at the Black Hat security conference on Thursday, saying it will begin offering cash bounties of up to $200,000 to researchers who discover vulnerabilities in its products, Apple Insider reports. The program, which will officially launch in September, will initially be invitation-only. Exactly who will receive these invitations was unclear, but the company saysÂ that non-members who find particularly interesting bugs and report them could find an invitation waiting. For now, Apple Insider reports the payouts for security issues are relegated to five categories of risk: â€¢ $200,000 for secure boot firmware components â€¢ $100,000 for extraction of confidential material protected by the Secure Enclave Processor â€¢ $50,000 for execution of arbitrary code with kernel privileges â€¢ $50,000 for unauthorized access to iCloud account data on Apple servers â€¢ $25,000 for access from a sandboxed process to user data outside of that sandbox Apple Insider reports that it appears Apple will expand the risk categories in the future, but the company didnâ€™t say when. TechCrunch reports that Apple will determine the exact reward amount based on the clarity of the vulnerability report; the novelty of the problem and the likelihood of user exposure; and the degree of user interaction necessary to exploit the vulnerability. Researchers who choose not to take a payout, but instead donate it to charity, will see their payment matched one-for-one by Apple. 10-Year-Old Receives $10K Facebook Bug Bounty For Finding Instagram Comment Flaw Government Asking People To “Hack The Pentagon” To Find Security Flaws Founded in 2005, Consumerist is an independent source of consumer news and information published by Consumer Media LLC, a not-for-profit subsidiary of Consumer Reports.
