Brazil judge orders phone carriers to block WhatsApp message app | Reuters SAO PAULO A Brazilian judge ordered wireless phone carriers to block access to Facebook Inc's WhatsApp indefinitely, starting on Tuesday, the third such incident against the popular phone messaging app in eight months. The decision by Judge Daniela Barbosa Assun√ß√£o de Souza in the southeastern state of Rio de Janeiro applies to Brazil's five wireless carriers. The reason for the order was not known due to legal secrecy in an ongoing case, and will only be lifted once Facebook surrenders data, Souza's office said. S√£o Paulo-based representatives at WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook Inc, as well as the Brazilian five carriers - Telefonica Brasil SA, Am√©rica M√≥vil SAB's Claro, TIM Participa√ß√µes SA, Oi SA and Nextel Participa√ß√µes SA - did not have an immediate comment.
