Yahoo focused on selling core assets to Verizon: sources | Reuters The ticker and trading information for Verizon is displayed on a screen at the post where it is traded on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S. June 9, 2016. Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) is focused on selling its core assets to U.S. telecommunications company Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N)  after reviewing final bids that it received in an auction, people familiar with the matter said on Friday. Yahoo views Verizon as the buyer that can deliver the most value, but negotiations between the two companies are continuing, and no deal has yet been reached, the people said. The value of Verizon's bid could not be learned. The sources requested anonymity because the negotiations are confidential. Verizon and Yahoo did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Bloomberg reported earlier that Verizon was nearing a deal for Yahoo's core assets. The key to understanding what’s going on lies not with personalities, campaign strategies or party rules but rather with the voter.   PDF Document   Reuters News Agency | Brand Attribution Guidelines | Delivery Options Reuters is the news and media division of Thomson Reuters .
