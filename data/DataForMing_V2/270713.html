Chronicling My Apple Analysis Over 2015: How The Bull Became A Bear - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha In the past year, I made a couple incorrect observations given the available knowledge at the time. Investors have been wondering why a long-term AAPL bull turned into a bear, and quite frankly, it was mostly driven by shifts in my own fundamental assumptions. Furthermore, the weakness in the market environment in conjunction with forward-looking indicators forced me to change my stance on AAPL towards the end of the year. Clearly, I was very optimistic, and at the time I felt like I had connected the dots correctly. However, my observations were clearly incorrect, which resulted in some missed calls. However, as more material information surfaced, I changed my stance. In the end, I was timely enough to alert investors to further downside in Apple. One of my readers asked me to chronicle why I had changed my stance on Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) over the year, and with the overwhelming response among readers demanding me to reply back to that comment with an article, here I am! I don't have the original question on hand and it's extremely long to quote. But essentially, the reader asked, "Why did you change your stance on AAPL over the course of 2015?" Very good question and it's worth writing an entire article on. Alright, so where do I even begin? Going into FY 2015 (basically Q4 of 2014), I made a couple flawed assumptions on Apple: I thought demand for iPad would recover (Tim Cook was banging the table saying that the segment would produce much better results given enough time). Yeah, it was the worst year on record for the iPad and that decline wasn't mitigated with the timely release of the iPad Pro (the product had many delays and was never released in the timeframe I was operating on). I also thought the Apple Watch would hit the sales channel with volume production in Q2'FY 15 (Nope, that never happened, GT Advanced Technologies went bankrupt delaying initial supply). I then thought the market would value the company at a higher multiple (nope that never happened, the equity market was weak and whatever strength Apple could exhibit got sapped away in the latter half of the year). I was expecting healthier gross margins due to product mix shift to higher memory and screen tiers (nope gross margins improved marginally because the initial ramp of various new devices along with higher component cost inputs mitigated the upward momentum on margins). Furthermore, growth was heavily lopsided to China's rapid consumption growth, which was fueled by speculation over the Chinese economy. Again, reading into the Chinese macro figures shows a pattern of economic moderation with GDP growth primarily being driven by GDP per capita as the primary basis for growth. Moving from low middle class to affluent is a statistical shift that takes time. The spread between household income and GDP growth widened, which is why speculation over the rise of a consumer-class China became the primary justification to overweighting of cyclical Chinese names. Unfortunately, the spread widening doesn't create an overnight population of hungry consumers with comparable wallets to the EU and United States. It's a great leading indicator, but unfortunately it couldn't support the rapid expansion of the Shanghai Composite Index. Investors started to discount Apple's exposure to China as a result of market pricing, which weighs on the minds of analysts to this day. I also thought Apple Pay would be immediately accretive to operating profits to the tune of a couple billion dollars (whoops, not a lot of people used the thing and competing services started to surface in the span of a couple quarters). I was expecting something better than the big announcement at WWDC 2015. The new service that was launched this year? Apple Music, hardly a needle mover because it's more of a replacement to Apple's cash cow business (iTunes). The company just re-positioned itself in music, which is more about managing risk and staying relevant. It's not going to meaningfully impact revenue due to the competing nature of streaming as opposed to perpetual music licenses. When I closed out 2014, I made this big claim that Apple would go to $174. I think readers remember this article, because it was so widely read in comparison to all the other instances where I do the moonwalk backwards and start lowering my PT throughout 2015. The sad irony was that the company had a pretty stellar year and reported revenue that was just shy of the $239 billion I had forecast for FY 2015. All they needed were Apple Watch sales to reach that incremental $6 billion gap in my forecast. I also thought gross margins would be pretty good due to the low cost of Apple Watch components and the spread of pricing tiers to push ASPs higher. Unfortunately, at the time I did not realize that the software development cost for Watch OS would be so large, and various production ramp issues would mitigate profitability so significantly. Therein lies the reason why I was off by a factor of $40 or something. Remember, when you operate off of a multiple the $2.00 difference in EPS is enough to throw forecast assumptions off by a lot. I also felt like the company had such a blowout quarter in Q1'15 that sentiment would surf the stock so much higher. Instead, the stock found its resistance area in the mid-$130s as everyone sort of caught onto the realization that things weren't going to get much better than this. In fact, Carl Icahn more or less signaled the top of the euphoria with his big splash of an article in the middle of the year where he paints a picture perfect world for Apple investors. Of course, he's held onto his position despite the challenging environment for stocks in general. The various concerns that started to materialize throughout the year started to eat away at investor confidence with the exception of Icahn of course. But then again, Carl Icahn is a pretty gutsy guy and has super high risk tolerance. If he can hold onto Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ), I'm sure he can withhold any temptation of selling a somewhat volatile stock like Apple. I say somewhat volatile, but in reality it's very volatile. It just isn't the rollercoaster ride Netflix was. So, if you're mentioning Carl Icahn as a pillar for investor sentiment, he's not the guy. He's a bit more contrarian and he's way more patient when compared to the vast majority of fund managers I have ever interacted with. He's also an activist, so his edge gives him more confidence to hold onto a stock. So, where do I start to turn back my stance on Apple? Well, my euphoric optimism started to peak out at $194. I couldn't come up with any other reasons for why the stock could possibly do any better, so I started to question myself over the next couple months. I revised my EPS estimate lower in response to Q1'15 results, which later proved to be too high. I anticipated market sentiment to improve, so I raised my price target to $194. But, as we had moved throughout the year, the entire market didn't produce any returns. The faster moving horse, i.e. Apple, was going up as fast as it possibly could. The remaining companies were struggling because their low single digit growth rates were mitigated by currency headwinds with no hedges to offset the impact. Commodity prices rapidly deflated, so investors thought this was a precursor to a deflationary environment, which made it difficult for the Fed to raise rates in response to CPI pressure. I also had to take into consideration the slowdown in M&A activity following a rate hike, which puts downward pressure on valuations. In the end, I concluded the market multiple would struggle in an environment like this. As such, the respective return of Apple when compared to the market was limited, which eventually led to multiple compression. The year wore on, and my fears about a flat market environment that couldn't break past key resistance levels continued to wear on me. I knew then at this point I would have to revise my stance lower despite the strong performance of Apple. There was just no way Apple could outpace the market so substantially without the entire market going along for the ride. The force of gravity came down on Apple investor sentiment as it did with every other stock. The best run company on Earth was no exception to this, so I started making my way towards the exit before it got too crowded. I lowered my PT from $194 to $136 in this specific article and revised my stance to be more broadly in-line. At this point, I got the right figures as I revised to $231 billion in sales and $9.16 EPS, the company later goes onto report $233 billion for FY 2015 and $9.28 basic EPS. So, I get things a lot closer leading up to the final quarter. The price target I arrive at was $136 roughly where I stood in Q3'14. When looking back, if I had plugged in the right figures I would have arrived at the right price target. I also thought that there was no way the stock was going to revisit $136 because it already happened. Quite frankly, the market is forward looking, so I have to move over to 2016 estimates to get an accurate idea of how the stock will behave in the last quarter of 2015. I started to weigh valuation risk, questioned whether smartphone demand could be sustained, and whether Apple can mitigate the negative aspects of its business model on the S part of the cycle. I also realized that they couldn't do this without better product features. The product didn't improve its base storage configurations or along the entire product stack. Prices for NAND flash fell precipitously, so that's when I called out Tim Cook for being too reliant on the strength of the brand as he fell short of a reasonable quality threshold given the premium pricing of the iPhone. I also realized that issues pertaining to demand were beginning to percolate given the search engine trends that a Jefferies analyst highlighted in the beginning of October. I didn't take those risks too seriously because I weighted the comments from Tim Cook higher as he mentioned iPhone units will grow in Q1'FY 16 on the Q4'FY 15 quarterly conference call. Unfortunately, more bad news started to surface from channel checks from analysts like Credit Suisse, UBS and even Morgan Stanley (I'll update the commentary on analysts over the course of the week). The weakness in demand that was indicated by search trends in the beginning of October started to show up in channel checks towards the middle of November (at this point I couldn't ignore the potential weakness in FY'16 results and potential downside to the valuation of the stock). At this point, I'm pretty bearish on the stock and my revision to my most recent financial model wasn't really well-received by the AAPL investment community. I also had to factor in more multiple compression , because of environmental factors and historical volatility. I revised my price target from $116.34 to $103.50 and my timing couldn't have been more perfect given today's market price. I realize that many of you are blanketing me with comparisons to other contributors or have made blanket accusations on some of the stuff I had said in the past year. They were all honest mistakes, and I feel that I've corrected my stance quickly enough before things got a little too carried away. Of course, there's always room for further improvement, and I'm hoping that given enough time a compelling opportunity for buying Apple on the cheap does in fact emerge. At that point, I'd be very compelled to switch my stance, but until a compelling valuation does surface I continue to reiterate my sell recommendation and $103.50 price target.
