Bank Of America Scores Major Victory - Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) | Seeking Alpha Bank of America won approval from the Federal Reserve to return more capital to shareholders. The approval comes after the bank was ordered last year to resubmit its capital return plan. I have covered few companies on Seeking Alpha more often than Ford Motor (NYSE: F ) and Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ). The investment case for Ford Motor has been chiefly underpinned by the notion that Mr. Market prices Ford's shares at a discount due to expectations of a cyclical fall-off in auto sales. However, Ford Motor's dividend proposition remains compelling since the company spoils investors with a five percent dividend yield. An investment in Bank of America shares a lot of the characteristics with a Ford investment. By that I mean investors price the bank's shares at a significant discount to accounting book value, which in turn creates a favorable reward-to-risk ratio. I have covered (and recommended) Bank of America to investors in light of the recent market turbulence after the British referendum last week that created a lot of new uncertainty in the financial and currency markets. All considered, Bank of America looks pretty good at today's prices, that was the conclusion of my last piece on the bank, " Bank Of America: Come On, Admit It, You Can't Lose Here, Can You? ". But there is yet another reason to buy Bank of America in addition to the bank's low valuation on an accounting book value basis and positive interest rate sensitivity. The bank is in the early stages of returning more capital to shareholders after passing the latest stress test exercise. If you remember, Bank of America was sort of scolded by the Federal Reserve last year, and made to resubmit its capital plan due to weaknesses related to its capital planning processes. This year, Bank of America passed the annual stress test exercise with flying colors, which means the bank is going to return a significant amount of capital to shareholders over the next year: Bank of America today announced that the company's Board of Directors plans to increase its quarterly common stock dividend by 50 percent to $0.075 per share, beginning in the third quarter of 2016. Also, the Board authorized the repurchase of $5 billion in common stock from July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2017. On a quarterly basis, this authorization represents an increase of more than 50 percent from the prior year's authorization. The Federal Reserve Board has informed the company that it completed its 2016 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review and that it did not object to Bank of America's capital plan, including the proposed dividend increase and repurchase plan. Brian Moynihan, Bank of America's Chief Executive Officer, continues to be under a lot of pressure from shareholders to boost capital returns in light of a stronger balance sheet and unsatisfactory share price returns. The Federal Reserve's approval of Bank of America's capital return plan, therefore, is a major victory for the bank, especially after it struggled last year to get the green light for its proposed capital plan. Importantly, the $5 billion stock buyback authorization gives Bank of America a lot of ammunition to take advantage of the gigantic discount to accounting book value. The Federal Reserve has approved Bank of America's capital return plan that includes $5 billion in stock buybacks and a 50 percent increase in the bank's base dividend. While the dividend increase was significant in percentage terms, the shares continue to yield relatively little, about 2.26 percent based on the new dividend payout. However, the approval paves the way for higher capital returns down the road, which is a big win for the bank considering its struggles with gaining approval for its capital return plan last year. Further, buying back shares at a VERY STEEP discount to accounting book value is not the worst idea. Buy for capital appreciation. Disclosure: I am/we are long BAC, F.
