Microsoft: Cheap Windows Hybrid Tablets/Notebooks Can Equalize The Threat Of Chromebooks - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Affordable games-capable Windows 8.1 tablet/notebooks can equalize the threat of Chromebooks. The Cherry Mobile Alpha Morph is a much cheaper version of the Asus Transformer 2-n-1 Windows 8 laptop. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) made the right decision to pick Cherry Mobile as its partner last year. Cherry Mobile has 21.9% market share in smartphone sales in the Philippines. Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) (who has refused to release a new Windows 8 phone) is second with 13.3% market share. Cherry Mobile is now expanding its Windows 8 initiative beyond smartphones by selling affordable games-friendly tablets and hybrid 2-n-1 notebooks. March and April are the graduation season among schools colleges here in the Philippines. Cherry Mobile is taking advantage of the graduation season to help Microsoft sell more Windows 8.1 tablets and hybrid 2-n-1 notebooks. Pricing is always important when selling a product and Cherry Mobile is as good as Xiaomi when it comes to undercutting the prices of rivals. The Cherry Mobile Alpha Morph is a much cheaper version of the revamped Asus (OTC: ASUUY ) Transformer T-100 which sells for P22,995 ($517.90). Cherry Mobile is urging parents and relatives to gift their newly graduated kids a touchscreen Windows 8.1 Alpha Morph 2-n-1 notebook . The Alpha Morph's new promo price is just P9,999 ($225.20), a big discount from its original P11,999 ($270.25). The Asus Transformer has a much bigger storage, USB and HDMI ports, and higher resolution display. However, the 50% cheaper Cherry Mobile Alpha Morph is always guaranteed to sell well in a price-sensitive like the Philippines. This deal with Cherry Mobile is a great template that Microsoft should use in other countries. Winning the support of popular local brands ( not OEMs like Samsung) is a very effective way to propagate Windows phones, tablets, and computers. High-school and college students found the Cherry Mobile Alpha Morph attractive because it is capable of running DoTA 2 and Counter-Strike . In spite of the low price of the Alpha Morph, it is a decent portable gaming machine that plays all popular PC games on lower-graphic quality settings. Microsoft has been losing ground to Google's (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Chromebooks in the U.S. particularly in the education system. However, I am confident that Chromebooks will have little appeal to students in the Philippines. Students and home users will likely still prefer a Windows notebook that could run Microsoft Office 2013, DoTA, or League of Legends. My point is that Windows PC sales to students might greatly benefit if Microsoft starts selling a re-branded (use Lumia branding?) Cherry Mobile Alpha Morph in the U.S. I am sure that millions of high school and college kids in America are also addicted to DoTA 2 and League of Legends . The Alpha Morph is as cheap as Chromebooks but students cannot use their Chromebooks for League of Legends after they are done with school/homework. Letting kids play video games is good for them . Parents can save more money when they buy a cheap Windows 8 hybrid that can also run Android apps and games. The Alpha Morph can be used as an Android machine using BlueStacks . This is the beauty of Windows machines, they can run Android OS apps. Furthermore, the 2GB of RAM inside the cheap Alpha Morph means it can also use VirtualBox to run Chrome OS . But the most important thing really is that cheap games-capable Windows tablet hybrid products are great equalizers to the rising threat of Chromebooks and Android tablets. I reiterate my position that Microsoft's focus on cheap tablets, smartphones, and hybrid 2-n-1s is an excellent way to gain advertising eyeballs. The new freemium strategy of Microsoft could only be implemented by recruiting more people to use Windows computers and mobile devices. Freemium made Google super-successful in mobile. Likewise, Nadella might just be able to replicate Google's success by giving away free software and selling cheap mobile gadgets. Recruiting the help of successful local vendors is also a great way for Microsoft to penetrate the Android-saturated emerging markets like the Philippines. The success of Cherry Mobile's Windows 8.1 hybrid 2-n-1s has also inspired other Filipino mobile brands to sell their own Windows PCs. StarMobile has released the Engage 10 PRO last month for P11,990 ($270.04) and CloudFone has also released its Epic 8.0 hybrid tablet/notebook. Cherry Mobile, StarMobile, and CloudFone had their beginnings selling Android smartphones. They are now helping Microsoft realize Nadella's freemium strategy. Local brands like Xiaomi and Cherry Mobile have beaten Samsung in their respective markets. I say Windows 10's future is bright even if Samsung never releases a Windows 10 smartphone or tablet. MSFT is a Buy . Like the Alpha Morph, MSFT is cheaper than the competition. Compared to its industry and sector peers, Microsoft has lower P/E, P/Cash, and P/Free Cash Flow. Microsoft is also a dividend star with 3.01% yield. Eleven other expert analysts at TipRanks agree with my Buy rating for MSFT. The long-term technical indicators are also favorable for Microsoft.
