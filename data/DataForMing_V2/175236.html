Ford Motor: Time To Double Down And Gobble Up Shares - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford Motor released strong U.S. sales numbers for the month of August at the beginning of September. U.S. sales increased 5.4% in August after rising 4.9% in July. Economic fundamentals favor an investment in Ford. The U.S. auto market is in excellent shape. Ford Motor (NYSE: F ), for instance, sold 4.9% more cars, trucks and utility vehicles in the month of July compared to last year, but if you thought that's the best Ford could do, think again. Earlier this month, Ford Motor released excellent U.S. sales figures for the month of August and the automaker blew through expectations: In August, Ford Motor said it sold 234,237 vehicles, which was 5.4% more than a year ago when Ford sold 222,174. Ford Motor now sold 1,750,589 vehicles in the first eight months of the year. In the same period last year, Ford Motor sold 1,704,442 vehicles. The sales numbers were indeed excellent news for Ford's shareholders, because they attest to the strength of the U.S. auto market and to the disconnect between Ford's actual sales performance in its most important market, the United States, and Ford's valuation. Ford's August performance was driven by growing utilities and truck sales, while car sales remained weak. In August, Ford Motor sold 69,877 cars, which was 7.0% less than a year ago. Utilities sales rose 12.3% from 66,396 in August 2014 to 74,590 in August 2015 whereas truck sales increased 11.3% year-over-year to 89,770. Economic fundamentals support bullish investment thesis In previous articles about the auto company I contended that Ford Motor will most likely see continued momentum on both a volume and price basis for two reasons: 1. The labor market is tightening, which supports wage gains and boosts consumer spending. Full employment and consumer spending growth could fuel demand for pickups even more in the months ahead. Pickup demand is already strong, especially for Ford's F-150. 2. Confidence in the U.S. economy is high. Even if the Fed lifts rates this week, economic conditions are the best they have been since the Great Recession. And Ford's earnings are set to profit. According to Ford Motor's latest press release, the auto maker had the "best August performance in nine years", and Ford's best-selling F-Series continues to exceed expectations: In August, Ford Motor sold more than 70,000 F-Series trucks, while F-Series retail sales shot up 15%. While Ford Motor produces excellent sales results month after month, at least in the United States, investors still avoid the company as an investment. For one thing, auto makers are simply not favorites in the stock market right now. Secondly, investors are more cautious about stocks after the stock market turbulence in China at the end of August caught investors off guard. Since Ford Motor's shares have dropped ~13% from their 52-week high at $16.77, the sell-off might be a good opportunity to gobble up shares of the auto manufacturer. Ford is doing a great job in the United States, and robust economic fundamentals regarding real GDP growth , employment , personal income growth bode well for consumer spending, and Ford Motor's profits. Further, China will likely not head for a prolonged recession. And even if China's growth slumped, Ford Motor would not be as badly affected as many investors like to think. Ford Motor's results are largely driven by the United States, and the U.S. is doing just fine. Ford's August sales numbers are proof that the U.S. auto market is in excellent shape and investors have a lot to look forward to in terms of sales growth. The risk of a U.S. recession triggered by a slowdown in China is quite low in my opinion. As long as the U.S. consumer spends money, Ford Motor will flourish. Ford Motor below $15 is a screaming "Buy". Disclosure: I am/we are long F. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
