Facebook ( FB +0.9%) is making a big bet live videos will encourage more engagement from the site's 1.65M monthly users. Monetization will be worried about later. Could some1 plz tell me why all of a sudden are we getting BOMBARDED with FB articles?? Geez people we are shareholders and we really don't care. Most of us smart people have been in since high teens and not selling one share. So even though the articles are both good and bad they are beginning to get a little over blown here I think.. IMO 140 deals will bring in 50 million in revenues. Average 357,000. This way for 1 billion extra turnover they need 2800 contracts.
