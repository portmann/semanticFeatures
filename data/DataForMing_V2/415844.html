Avoid Alibaba And All Known Associates - Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) | Seeking Alpha We've been questioning Alibaba for the last 6 months in a series of articles. We've also raised (until yesterday) unsubstantiated questions about whether YHOO's stake in BABA could be holding up a sale of the company. We've raised questions about Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) over the last 4 to 6 months that may have seemed speculative in nature and without real evidence to back it up. We were told that we were crazy in the comment section of our articles. Now, it's looking like we may have been on to something all along. Over the course of the last 6 months, we have written a series of articles both on Alibaba and on Yahoo. For BABA, the theme of our articles was to avoid the company and stay a long way away. We raised a lot of questions about why the company needs a recent $4 billion loan from US banking institutions and why CEO Jack Ma needed to borrow $2 billion against his shares in the company. We also made several points about the company, not the least of which were about the opaque manner in which its financials are presented and the lack of transparency that US shareholders have as investors in the company. We commended work done by Herb Greenberg and John Hempton and our last article advised readers to review their work and their skeptical inquiries about the Chinese company. Along the lines of why we would not invest in BABA, we similarly noted in several articles that we would avoid Yahoo. We even make several speculations that the hold up and getting a Yahoo spin off or sale deal finished could have something to do with BABA somehow throwing a wrench in the gears, as people got deeper and deeper into their due diligence of Yahoo stake in the company. Yesterday, news broke that the SEC had launched a probe into BABA. The Wall Street Journal reported , Federal regulators are investigating the accounting practices of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., the e-commerce giant whose blockbuster U.S. stock-market debut helped win a wide following for Chinese tech firms. The company disclosed Tuesday that the Securities and Exchange Commission asked Alibaba to provide details of its accounting for a delivery affiliate, its operating data for the largest online shopping day of the year, and "related party transactions in general." When trying to discern whether or not this is a real investigation or this is more along the lines of a comment letter, Professor Paul Gillis did a fantastic write up saying that this inquiry is probably somewhere in between. Gillis explains, The SEC routinely asks questions about company filings and accounting practices with what are called Comment Letters . These questions are asked by the Division of Corporate Finance of the SEC. Most every public company gets these inquiries every few years, and they are generally resolved without serious implications. Often a company will modify disclosures going forward, and sometimes they are required to restate previously filed financial statements. More rarely, staff inquiries from the Division of Corporate Finance lead to a referral to the SEC's Division of Enforcement, or even to a referral to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution. The Division of Enforcement is charged with the responsibility to investigate possible violations of federal securities laws, which may lead to civil action by the SEC or a referral to Justice for criminal prosecution. Mr. Gillis does a fantastic job laying out what the potential points and circumstances could be behind the SEC inquiry, and concludes that this may be a little bit more then a division of corporate finance inquiry. His full blog post is worth reading. If the enforcement division is involved, it is a real investigation and probe into potential wrongdoing. We don't have that level of transparency from the company yet (surprise, surprise) but we are guessing the details will make their way out into the public domain over the course of the next few weeks. The VIE structure with which these companies use to list in the United States leaves them in full control, with US investors lacking the same traditional rights they would have as a US listed equity holder in any other company. The loans taken out by the company and Jack Ma also raised red flags for us months ago. The company's language surrounding Alipay, and how it is an integral part of the way BABA transacts money is equally mysterious and alarming Related party transactions have also been called into question, as have the logistics of the company's shipping and distribution centers by John Hempton. Basically, almost every part of this company has had questions raised about it. That should make shareholders feel uncomfortable, and definitely raises enough unanswered questions for us to dabble in BABA as a short position. To conclude, we believe that this inquiry is a little bit more than a formality. We believe the fact that the SEC has identified three individual target points tells us that they have been looking into this for sometime and that they're serious about their inquiry. The question then becomes whether or not Alibaba can produce a series of documents that are going to be transparent enough and have enough real evidence to appease the regulators. Theoretically, if the company was involved in manipulation or fraud, what would they have to lose from producing fabricated documentation for an SEC inquiry? This is specifically why, regardless of the SEC outcome, we believe still that investors should not own shares of BABA. There are too many better ways to play the China or retail space without tying yourself up in a company where the US based shareholders have little or no power. Finally, the same goes for Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ). The questions we raised about Yahoo in our last few articles stand. Not only do we question Yahoo's management, but we again would not be surprised to find that there was some type of hang up in evaluating the company due to BABA.
