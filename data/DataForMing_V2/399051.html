Carl Icahn Is Out Of Apple: Why He's Wrong (Again) - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Noted investor Carl Icahn stated on CNBC that he no longer has a position in Apple, due to its disappointing earnings and worries over China. This comes just one year after Icahn famously bought Apple stock and said it was worth $240. In an interview with CNBC last week, legendary investor Carl Icahn stated he has sold out of his Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) position. Investors may recall that it was Icahn who famously said in May last year that he believed Apple was worth $240 per share, when the stock was trading at about $130. But as investors well know, that was the top for Apple, which hasn't seen that level since-the stock now trades around $94. Carl Icahn Is Wrong, Apple Is Not Worth $240 Today The reason I disagreed with Icahn was not that I wasn't bullish on Apple over the long-term. Far from it; Apple is my second-largest investment. But I understood the reality of the short-term, which would be extremely difficult comparisons in 2016. And, I felt it was a mistake for investors to take Icahn's comments on face value and buy the stock based on his comments. Anyone who did that is sitting on a significant loss. The problem with Icahn's $240 call is that it was based on expectations that were far out of touch with reality. As I wrote in the previous article, I believed most of his assumptions were irrational. But the good news is that Icahn is being irrational once again, as is the market. Don't sell Apple here. Carl Icahn's extreme bullishness on Apple was built upon a number of assumptions, which I did not at all feel were based in reality. Among the reasons where I specifically felt Icahn was wrong: 1. He believed Apple would soon enter the car industry in a major way (it didn't). 2. He believed Apple would earn $12 per share in fiscal 2016 (it won't). 3. He believed Apple would receive a valuation of 18 times earnings (it hasn't). Many more of his assumptions were simply off-base. As I wrote in the previous article, Icahn had assumed $45 billion in Apple Watch sales in fiscal 2017, and $37 billion in television sales that year as well. What Icahn was missing was that, last May, Apple was fresh off the heels of the iPhone 6 release. Since the iPhone represents the majority of Apple's total revenue, approximately 65%, new iterations of the iPhone are the biggest driver of growth. When Apple was trading for around $130, about the time Icahn made his $240 prediction, I specifically warned investors not to ignore the post-iPhone lull that typically results in a significant decline in Apple's share price. This is exactly what happened after the release of the iPhone 5-the company recorded massive growth, but then a natural regression occurred until the iPhone 6. But as we all remember, after Apple's slowdown after the iPhone 5, analysts and pundits in the financial media were quick to pronounce Apple as a dying company, whose best days were behind it. That's precisely what is happening now. The entire world is freaking out because Apple's results last quarter didn't meet forecasts. Despite the panic, Apple still sold 51 million iPhones! This in itself shows the true power of Apple's brand: even without the benefit of a new iPhone model, Apple still sold astonishing numbers of devices. Sure, it wasn't as much as the 74 million sold in the previous quarter, but again, this is merely a problem of difficult comparisons. This does not represent a real deterioration of the business, as some seem to think. Just consider that even in a very difficult year Apple, in which it has grappled with the iPhone lull, slowing global economic growth, and the strong U.S. dollar, the company still raked in $33 billion of free cash flow over the first half of the fiscal year. It ended last quarter with $232 billion in cash, short-term investments, and long-term marketable securities on its balance sheet. These are simply astonishing figures, and yet when Apple has a bad quarter or two, that everyone should have known would be poor, it's as if the company's days are numbered. Those assuming Apple will never grow again are simply wrong. The next major growth catalyst for Apple will be the iPhone 7. But investors will have to endure some weak quarterly reports until then, so investors should brace for the prospect that the current quarter will miss estimates as well. The reason why Apple will continue to grow for many, many years, has a lot to do with penetration into new markets. Geographically, Apple still has two major opportunities ahead of it: China and India. These are two of the world's premier emerging markets, with populations exceeding 1 billion each, rising middle classes, and economic growth well ahead of developed nations like the United States. And, these are countries where Apple's penetration remains low, particularly in India, where iPhone sales soared 56% last quarter . Apple still has just a 2% market share there, and while competition will be stiff, this is why Apple decided to unveil the lower-priced iPhone SE-specifically to gain market share in India, and once those people are into Apple's ecosystem, it's highly unlikely they'll leave. Another catalyst is Apple's services business, which was Apple's second-largest revenue category last quarter. Sales in this business grew 20% to $6 billion last quarter, its highest total ever. And, it's important to note that this is a recurring-revenue business that is independent of unit sales. Icahn simply had unrealistic expectations. Apple probably won't earn $12 this year and it also probably won't be valued for 18 times earnings any time soon. But investors don't need the company to hit these targets in order to earn strong returns. If Apple simply earns $10 at a 12 multiple, that's a $120 price right there, which would be a 26% return, not including Apple's above-average dividend yield. That's why it's so important to buy low, not after a big rally as Icahn recommended last year. The good news is that everyday investors can use Wall Street's obsession with quarterly results to their advantage. Simply buy Apple when everyone else is convinced the company is doomed, and don't buy when everyone else is in the midst of euphoria.
