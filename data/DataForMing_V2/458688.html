Why Wal-Mart Pay Will Struggle - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) | Seeking Alpha But Wal-Mart Pay will not sustain user growth over time. Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) will have trouble sustaining user growth on its mobile pay platform over time. Wal-Mart launched Wal-Mart Pay last year in response to customer demand for a mobile app that could "streamline the shopping experience" and make things more convenient for patrons. While the likes of Apple ( OTC:APPL ), Android, Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) and others have expanded into mobile payment in recent years, Wal-Mart was the first retailer to venture into the space. Wal-Mart Pay is now available at all locations nationwide, and management views the 45% increase in Pay transactions (88% of which came from repeat customers) as an indicator that the app can be successful in the long run. We argue that the app provides little in the way of added convenience, and that the firm's strategy of banning rival payment apps at Wal-Mart stores will backfire. One of the main reasons Wal-Mart introduced its payment app was to make checkout easier for customers. But most shoppers are already accustomed to paying with credit cards, a process that requires that one simply reach into his or her pocket and swipe. Wal-Mart Pay is a step behind rivals such as Apple Pay and Android Pay when it comes to convenience. Whereas WMT's service requires users to trigger an app, sign in, and complete a scan through a barcode reader, Apple and Android use Near Field Communication technology and only require a fingerprint scan. The sizeable increase in payment transactions that occurred over the last week was to be expected given that Wal-Mart just expanded the number of stores accepting the app. The fact that repeat customers were responsible for the vast majority of transactions does not surprise us either, considering the loyalty customers display to the Wal-Mart brand. The real question with Wal-Mart Pay is whether the firm can attract more users to the app over time, and so far WMT has not been able to expand the user base. The company reported "over 20 million" active users last week. Not long after Wal-Mart originally launched the app the company reported 24 million. Wal-Mart will have trouble attracting users to its app over a time, largely as a result of the strategy the firm put in place when it introduced Wal-Mart Pay. Wal-Mart decided to ban all competing payment apps, including the widely used Apple Pay and Android Pay, from its stores in order to create a monopoly around its payment app and keep customers entrenched. The idea was that, as shoppers became more accustomed to paying for everything through one app it would reduce the incentive to shop at other stores. But we believe that network effects will prevent Wal-Mart Pay from succeeding in the long run. Apple Pay and Android Pay have risen in popularity because they can be used at any store (with the exception of Wal-Mart). The entire point of a mobile payment app is to make things more convenient, and customers don't want to use a separate app every time they shop at a different store. Because most shoppers don't buy everything they need at Wal-Mart, an app used exclusively at Wal-Mart provides limited utility. As the merchant bases of rival payment systems grow, it will become more tedious for customers to use a separate app for Wal-Mart. This is how the strategy could backfire. If more retailers begin to accept Apple Pay and Android Pay (which would attract more users to these platforms), Wal-Mart would eventually have to accept these other payment systems, unless it wanted to be the one retailer that " made shopping inconvenient " for everyone. Best Buy (NYSE: BBY ) and Rite Aid (NYSE: RAD ) recently accepted Apple Pay, and as customers continue to gravitate to one or two main payment systems, more retailers will be incentivized to do the same. A greater number of retailers accepting a given payment system will, in turn, attract more shoppers to that app, and the cycle continues. The most effective strategy for countering Wal-Mart Pay would be to partner with as many retailers as possible, accelerate network effects, and force Wal-Mart to cave. The mobile payment market is in its infant stages, and there is massive growth potential. But WMT will ultimately lose out to Apple Pay and Android Pay. Shoppers want to use one app for all their shopping needs, and as more merchants partner with competing platforms WMT will have no choice but to concede.
