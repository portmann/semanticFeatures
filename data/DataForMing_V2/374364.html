Ford's Global Struggles - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Seven regions around the world mark Ford's global footprint. How is Ford faring around the world, and where do they need to focus their energies for the future? With seven regions accounting for the bulk of Ford's (NYSE: F ) worldwide sales, the company's performance in these core markets are critical to the success of their sales and marketing strategy as well as their profitability in each of these regions. Let's look at what kind of market share Ford enjoys in each of the regions they operate in to gain an overview of what's going well and where, and what isn't and why. Based on the data above, let's attempt to separate the wheat from the chaff, see who the movers and shakers are and hopefully arrive at a snapshot of the most important regions of focus for Ford. In past articles on Ford, I've typically concentrated my research on financial performance in core markets to identify all the reasons I thought that Ford stock would turn around and start heading North. Now that this is actually happening despite the negativity in the market about 'peak auto' and other theories that never really panned out, I think it's the right time to do a forward look on Ford's markets across the world. At this point I must throw out a disclaimer of sorts. Comparing market shares in different economies with different political systems, government biases towards local players and several other factors makes it a hard nut to crack. I've attempted to zero in on the markets where I think a concerted effort by Ford's product, marketing, sales and distribution strategies in those markets will yield far higher gains than what I see to be secondary and tertiary markets. In terms of sales as well as market share, the United States is obviously their hero. 40% of their sales happen there, and they own close to 15% of one of the most competitive automobile markets in the world. Sales, however, is only one side of the story; in a segment that's still growing at 3.6% globally , future market share is what the game is all about, and Ford U.S. has been losing more than a little ground in that area. Since their most recent peak market share of 16.5% in 2011, they've lost 180 basis points. Considering a 2015 market size of 17.5 million cars in 2015, that's a drop of 315,00 units over the fiscal. Small, yet significant in this crucial market. Ford's need of the hour in the U.S. market is to protect their market share at all costs. With car sharing on the increase, interest rates threatening to gradually increase over the year and the strengthening dollar affecting overseas revenues, Ford must divert the bulk of its attention to its home market and prevent market share erosion that may come from any quarter. For example, while EV market share projections are largely a guessing game at this point, one source puts 2025 estimates at around 25% of the automobile market share in the United States. The source also cites population migration, tax credits, the need for cleaner transportation and car-sharing as some of the key drivers of EV sales. Even if the EV market share is only a fraction of that 25% by then, any kind of significant move by Tesla, GM or any of Ford's EV competitors towards a mass-market EV with a battery range of 300+ miles will start nibbling at ICE sales at a faster rate. And Ford needs to be prepared to handle that encroachment. Another reason why Ford needs to protect market share like a lioness protecting her cubs is the fact that North America is its anchor right now. 40% of global sales are from the United States, and it is Ford's most profitable segment by far. As of February 2016 , Ford seems to have been doing that job right, and has shown a two-month increase in market share to about 15.6%. This is the kind of performance they need to keep showing month over month in order to keep their biggest earner intact. Ford has been making several entries into China from as far back as 1913 with the delivery of a Model T to its first buyer in China. Since then there has been a rich history that culminated in the opening of Ford Motor (China) Ltd., but the company has been serious about the Chinese market only since 2011. During that time, they've gone from new entrant to one with an enviable 4.5% market share that's continually expanding. With that extensive a history with the PRC, they should have been the market leader by now, but they're trailing behind others that came into the country after them - Hyundai being just one example. Granted, the Chinese market has been growing steadily and profitably for them, but at 1.16 million vehicles sold, it still represents less than 18% of Ford's overall sales - and 40% of U.S. sales. That "enviable 4.5%" now seems like a "mere 4.5%." This is the market Ford should push to the forefront in the coming decades as it keeps U.S. sales on an upward trend - or least holding steady, since many suppose we are in a 'peak auto' period. You can see how big of an impact China sales have on Ford's stock price. On March 7, Ford was at a recent high of $13.62 but fell again to the current $13.15 after reports of a 9% decline in sales for February 2016 over February 2015. Of the "average" performers in Ford's geographic lineup, Europe stands as a perfect example of Ford putting every possible effort into making a unit go from red to black. Ford Europe has been bleeding money for a long time, and it was only in the final quarter of 2015 that the turnaround happened. I've written extensively on this in my earlier articles, and Europe is poised on the threshold of making a big peace offering to Ford this year for its earlier lapses in profitability. They've already grown their sales by 11% in 2015 against an industry average of 9%, so they're still ahead of the game. Besides, they're already the numero uno in the commercial vehicle space and have executed some very effective cost-saving strategies in manufacturing over the past year. In Britain, they had two strong years in 2013 and 2014, but seem to have dipped in 2015. 2016 promises to be a good year with the first two months showing signs of market share expansion. I see 2016 as their make-or-break year in the UK. They'll need to pull all their resources together to replicate the success they had in 2011, and then go beyond. They've already got two passenger models in the Top 10 bestsellers in the UK, and the Ford Ka is all set to launch this year and compete in the 'supermini' segment that is popular in the UK. Of interest is the fact that the Ford Fiesta is UK's top selling car for the seventh year running as of 2015. Germany's 6.8% market share for Ford as of the first nine months in 2015 is an indication of the tough competition they face in that region with local automakers like Volkswagen ( OTCPK:VLKAY ) (21.4% market share), Mercedes ( OTCPK:DDAIF ) (8.9%), Audi ( OTCPK:AUDVF ) (8.6%) and BMW ( OTCPK:BAMXY ) (7.6%). Despite the backlash from Volkswagen's big emission debacle, the German automaker still dominates the German market by a wide margin. The Great White North offers a market share similar to the United States, but with sales of under 300,000, the market itself is only slightly more than a tenth of its Southern cousin. Even in that relatively small market, Ford doesn't seem to be able to hold its position; since 2011 it has lost about 270 basis points on market share. Ford's F-series and Ford Escape have a sizable presence on the roads, with the F-series in the clear lead. On the whole, things aren't looking too good in Canada so, in my humble opinion, it gets to keep the "average joe" tag for now. Brazil and Argentina market shares are growing well, but with under half a million in sales and the entire South American unit in the red by about $832 million for FY 2015, things don't look very promising. Fourth quarter sales, for example, drastically dipped on the prevalent recessions in these countries; both for a number of different reasons, but equally hit. Despite the bleak outlook, Ford has handled the situation admirably. For example, they didn't follow suit on price cuts like some other automakers did just to keep assembly lines running and inventory moving. What Ford did helped them preserve their pricing power despite the market share loss towards the end of the year, which offset the market loss share by $127 million - a $51 million increase over the previous quarter. In regards to pricing, they are now in a better position to take advantage of it once the political and economic situations in South America resolve themselves and this painful thorn in Ford's side is removed. Not that I think it's a total write-off, mind you; but looking at the figures it would seem that Mexico is more ideally suited to be a low-cost production country than a high-gain sales market. Between 2011 and 2015 Ford has lost 270 basis points in the country. Of course, the entire market is only worth 1.4% of Ford's overall sales, but it's still a significant loss. To counter their sales losses, Ford is now investing heavily in production, which is already a 14% contributor to Ford NA's capacity. By 2018, they intend to more than double the annual production with a capacity increase of 500,000 units. From a sales perspective, I'm pretty sure North America could be even more profitable without having Mexico included in their fraternity - although I couldn't find any specific break out of Mexico's earnings versus net income. That's why I feel Mexico is one Real Dud they can do without - but only on the sales side. From a production perspective, it will continue to be a gold mine until wages play catch-up with the rest of their North American segment. The outback offers a different outlook for the company, but it almost seems that they're carrying on as if nothing happened over the past few years. Ford Australia, which was originally one of the first markets to produce its own cars - first, in the form of the Falcon, which was fully designed in Australia from 1972, and then models like the Territory. In May 2013 , Ford Australia announced that after 88 years it would stop making cars. That was the first indication of the problem, and the reasons cited were "uncompetitive manufacturing costs and lackluster sales." That endgame is already happening, and Australia will once again become a sales outpost as far as major automakers are concerned - after a long period of being one of only 13 countries capable of building a car from the ground up, including design. As you may have noticed from the first table in this article, the company's share of market in core countries has been on the decline since 2011, which seems to have been a magical year for Ford. Australia has followed suit on that pattern, having lost nearly 3 percentage points since then. Entire sales volume for Australia stood at 71,000 - or 1.07% of global sales. Yet, Ford is optimistic about Australia, as has reasons to be. For example, the Ford Focus RS has a waiting list that stretches into mid-2017; the Ford Mustang is booked for up to 2000 orders of two variants - the EcoBoost and the V8; the new Mondeo, the Ford ST and the Ranger-based Everest SUV will all make their entrance as Ford Australia production winds down at the Geelong and Campbellfield facilities; in addition, they're also promoting their Mountune upgrade kits for the Fiesta ST and Focus ST. "[Ford Australia] showed a loss of A$141m dollars (£90m/$136m) after tax for the 2012 financial year. This followed a loss of A$290m in 2011 and a total loss of A$600m over the preceding five years." Some may view my opinion as overly optimistic with regard to Ford, but it only mirrors the company's own perception. As we've seen, Ford doesn't give up easily. It has been and continues to fight for every market that resists its efforts. On the other hand, they've let crucial markets like China slip from their grasp when they had the opportunity for high penetration. So much so, in fact, that they now have to claw their way back into recognition past stalwarts like VW and GM - not to mention the impending EV wars that will erupt all over the PRC in a few short years, the signs of which we are already seeing with companies like BYD and Kandi Technologies taking the lead. Ford now needs to focus its efforts on its biggest markets - holding firm in North America and penetrating deeper into China; leveraging everything they can in the 'average joe' segments; and making hard decisions on the 'duds.' Despite everything that's happened to its stock, Ford has stood steady on its strategies around the world, innovating where it needs to, consolidating where the situation demanded and always keeping an eye on profitability. I believe they've gone through yet another test of their resilience, and that they will go a long way. There is already a clear inflection of stock price action, and the 2016 outlook for the company seems as solid as the 100-year-old foundation it stands on.
