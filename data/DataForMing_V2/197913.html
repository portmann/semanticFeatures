Apple Is Undervalued, And Offers 2 Alternative Ways To Earn Extra Income - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Double Dividend Stocks , Double Dividend Stocks (2,059 clicks) There are alternative income-producing strategies for Apple, which dwarf its dividend. Apple looks undervalued -- it's at the low end of its 5-year P/E range, and is over 20% below analysts' average price target. Looking for alternative income investing strategies? Although Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) isn't a high dividend stock , it does have attractive option-selling yields, which can earn you much more than its dividends. Dividends: After a very long hiatus, 1995 to 2012, AAPL began paying dividends again in August 2012, starting with a $.37857 quarterly payout. It has raised the dividend every year since, up to the current $.52/share. Although its dividend yield is below 2%, AAPL also has the largest share buyback program in history, thanks to its huge ongoing cash generation: Options: If you're an income investor looking to increase your yields from AAPL, you might want to consider selling covered calls, which offer you much higher payouts than AAPL's current $.52/quarter. In fact, one of these trades pays 10x the amount of AAPL's dividend. We've listed 2 January 2016 call option trades below. The $115.00 call strike pays $5.20 vs. the $.52 dividend. It's also $4.22 above AAPL's price/share, so there's an opportunity for price gains as well. The January $120.00 call strike pays you a bit less, $3.40, since it's further "out of the money," i.e., further away from AAPL's price/share. However, if you're more bullish and want to leave more room for price gain potential, you may prefer the $120 strike. Selling Cash Secured Puts below a stock's price/share is a second alternative income strategy, which is a bit more conservative, but still offers an attractive option payout. This January $105.00 put option pays $5.15, again, nearly 10x AAPL's $.52 dividend. It gives you a $99.85 breakeven, which is 8% above AAPL's 52-week low. We've added this January put trade to our Cash Secured Puts Table , which lists more info for this and over 25 other put-selling trades: Earnings: Unlike many of the high dividend stocks we cover in our articles , which work on Distributable Cash Flow models, AAPL's earnings are centered on traditional earnings per share. AAPL's fiscal year ends around the end of September, so it will report its full-year fiscal 2105 earnings in late October. The growth numbers that AAPL has put up over the past four quarters are very impressive, especially when you consider that it has the biggest market cap in the market. One thing that hasn't grown is its share count, and that's a good thing -- AAPL has chipped away at its share count every quarter, and has decreased it by over 9% since fiscal fourth quarter 2014: 2014 vs. 2013: AAPL has already surpassed its fiscal 2014 Revenue, Net Income and Diluted EPS figures in just three quarters so far in fiscal 2015. It also reduced its share count by -6.12% in fiscal 2014. Valuations: AAPL looks undervalued -- it's very close to the low end of its 5-Year P/E range. It's also undervalued on a 2015 PEG basis, but not yet for 2016 -- analysts are more conservative so far in their 2016 estimates, which, of course, could increase, if AAPL continues to rack up strong growth. Analysts: AAPL has beaten consensus estimates for the past four quarters, and has gotten several upward analyst earnings estimate revisions over 7 and 30 days. Price Target: At its 10/7/15 price of $110.78, AAPL is 24% below analysts' mean target price of $145.64, which would also suggest that it's currently undervalued, and presents upside potential. Performance: Thanks to all of the recent market turbulence, investors have become a bit shy about buying AAPL, causing it to lag the S&P over the past month and year-to-date. It has outperformed the S&P, though, over the past year. All tables furnished by DoubleDividendStocks.com, unless otherwise noted.
