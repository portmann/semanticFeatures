At the Sept. 4 event, Disney stores and other retailers will open at 12:01 a.m. to sell products ranging from toys, books, and collectibles to comics, e-books, apps, apparel and lifestyle accessories, Disney said in a statement. New products will also be sold online at Disneystore.com. The company urged fans to document their Sept. 4 shopping experiences on social media with hashtags #ForceFriday and #MidnightMadness.
