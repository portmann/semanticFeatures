Boeing: The Cut Is Coming... But The Gap Is Not Closed Yet - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Boeing will be cutting rates, which will help bridge the gap somewhat. BA will likely close the gap until 2020. As I discussed in my previous article , Boeing (NYSE: BA ) finally admitted that the rate of the Boeing 777 will come down as the jet maker inserts "blanks" that will be used for the production of 777X parts. The production will be cut in 2018. Assuming that no Boeing 777X airframes will be delivered until the start of 2020, the rate cut will result in a $1.56 bn lower revenue per year, or $3.12 bn until the first delivery of the Boeing 777X. Six months ago, I showed the above image. I calculated that at least 243 orders were required to fill all the delivery slots until the start of 2020 while maintaining a production rate of 100 aircraft per year. An extra 50-150 orders might be required since 777X airframes will not be rolling out of the factories at high production rates from the start. So in a "best case" scenario, Boeing needed an additional 300 orders. Now, 6 months later, it is worth looking at how the gap and production rate have developed. Boeing already announced that the production rate for the Boeing 777 will be cut in 2018, meaning that less order inflow is required to bridge the gap. It is, however, interesting to look whether Boeing was even close to filling the gap without cutting rates. Boeing remained confident that it would be able to maintain current production rates. This means that the company was confident on receiving between about 50 orders per year for the Boeing 777. United Airlines (NYSE: UAL ) ordered 10 Boeing 777-300ERs. Remaining orders were from unidentified customers. So, Boeing did quite a good job securing orders; the combination of performance upgrades and discounts is helping the jet maker securing orders. Currently, Boeing has 262 unfilled orders. Figure 2: Production gap Boeing 777 (Source: Dhierin-Perkash Bechai ) Figure 2 shows that Boeing would need about 200 orders to fill all the delivery slots until 2020. So, the company did make some progress, but it needs to get a lot more orders to fill the gap. Boeing also recognized this, and from 2018 and onwards, it will be reducing the production rate from 8.3 to 7.3 per month. Figure 3: Production gap Boeing 777 after rate cut (Source: Dhierin-Perkash Bechai) The rate cut will result in a gap of 171 airframes. So, although the rate cut does help somewhat, the impact is marginal. This is caused by the fact that Boeing delayed a rate cut as much as it can, and has the possibility for 1 final rate cut in 2019, if required. This means that Boeing is assuming it will receive enough orders in the years to come. To close the gap, Boeing needs to receive about 40 orders per year (37.3 to be exact). In my previous article, I was somewhat skeptical about the company's ability to receive orders to fill the gap, but the addition of the performance improvement package and the discount convinced me a bit more that it can actually close the gap. So, Boeing's plan, more or less, looks as follows: Figure 4: Visualization of rate cuts and order inflow requirement (Source: Dhierin-Perkash Bechai) Figure 4 shows that Boeing can close the gap when it gets an additional 38 orders this year and in the years to come while cutting the rate by 1 unit per month in 2018. BA already acquired 25 orders this year and probably will try to secure some more during this year's Paris Air Show. Emirates, the largest operator of the Boeing 777-300ER, still holds 20 purchase rights for the Boeing 777-300ER and might acquire up to 15 more Boeing 777-200LRs. If Emirates places the order and firms up its purchase rights, BA will add another 35 777s to its order book, which is a huge step forward. So far, I only looked how to close the gap until 2020, when the Boeing 777X enters service. The company, however, wants to keep the production line for the current Boeing 777 alive until 2025. This basically means that, at a production rate of 88 airframes per year, the company will need an additional 352 orders on top of the 171 orders to fill the gap. So, Boeing needs to sell over 500 airframes. To close the gap all the way until 2025, BA will need over 60 orders per year. Closing the gap until 2020 is doable. Boeing will need about 40 orders per year to do so, but to close the gap all the way until 2025, the company will need about 60 orders per year. I don't think the company will be able to do so. I expect that BA will secure about 50 orders per year and will cut rates after 2020 while simultaneously ramping up production for the Boeing 777X. This should not hurt Boeing as long as it ramps up 777X production while decreasing the 777 production. So, although the rate cut reduces the needed order inflow a bit, it remains challenging for Boeing to secure enough orders. The long-term outlook increased, which bodes well for the Boeing 777X and the company. So, all in all, I remain positive about investing in Boeing. Source: Boeing: The Cut Is Coming...
