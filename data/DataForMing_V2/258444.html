Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) Ted Sarandos Present at the UBS 43rd Annual Global Media and Communications Conference Transcript | Seeking Alpha Good morning, we’re starting with our next session. We are very pleased to have with us A - Ted Sarandos, Chief Content Officer of Netflix. Ted, thank you very much for coming today. So, let start off with just, I want to get a better understanding of what your goals and targets are right now, it’s just been a ton of change, ton of growth in Netflix over the last few years. What was defying [ph] professional success were you looking forward? You know we’ve said many times, we are aspiring to have take that for [Indiscernible] global. So we keep chewing away at that effort year-over-year and we’ve been excited with the progress so far for Netflix to be a truly global brand not available and relevant in every part of the world. That makes sense. The years are winding down, so when you think back in 2015, you know what were the important dynamics from your perspective, what was better than expected, what was more challenging than expected? The international growth as we’ve been launching territory by territory. We used to -- we started out doing a country a time and then region at a time and I think in our last swing through where we did -- in this year alone we launched Italy, Spain, Portugal, Australia, Japan and I mean it was a pretty ambitious -- it’s a pretty ambitious year and they have all gone really well. And what’s been great about it as a company is that we’ve been able to do it with pretty minimal disruption now. So we can launch a big -- it was used to be that there was an all hands on debt saying that we are going to launch a new territory and everybody will be focussed on that territory every minute of every day for weeks or months at a time and now if you are not you know on the specific team working on it you are very [Indiscernible] so we’ve been able to systematize that to a way where there we could do it much more effectively and more efficiently. And to me it increases our confidence and our scale and our ability to scale. You know we’re embarking on sort of the next fairly new in terms of in the media space, global licensing and programming. This is outside of our original like you know having shows, networks and studio sells their rights to us on a global basis. And I say -- I don’t know if its more difficult than I expected but it’s not been an easy row because all of the studios and networks have situated themselves to the regional sellers. So they have international sales teams, they have an Asian sales team, and that’s because there has never been a global buyer, so it makes complete sense that selling the [Indiscernible] one of us would have regional sales teams. And now we are a global buyer buying global rights for shows and movies and there is some resistance to it but mostly from the regional sellers. And people who are in charge of regional selling who don’t want their job marginalized. So that’s something we are navigating with just the politics of the selling community. Just a cultural issue, it’s a pretty big change. And at the end of the day it’s a real structural change that I think all of our studio partners are wrestling with because there is certainly efficiency to what we are offering. It should be economically neutral meaning that I’m not trying to get or what I’m trying to use the scale to get a discount where you see us using the scale to get access. So, at the end of the day I think it’s something that will be good for the studios to have more efficient selling machines, to be more self sufficient selling machines, but you know we are kind of alone in this space of buying global rights. You know Ted, I joke sometimes that you have the best travel media, because you have overnight ratings that you have to deliver. So the sports guys they have some pretty fun jobs too, but how do we -- because we don’t have overnight ratings to measure you, how should investors measure whether you and your team are coming in you are succeeding whether you are coming in short. So we look at it as -- we’d like externally for you to look at our net subscriber growth. So as we are growing the subscriber base it’s because people are attracted to Netflix for their great content that they are going to watch, obviously they stick with it because of the great ease of use and the amazing user interphase and the fact that when you push play at works everywhere in the world at all different broadband speeds and all different devices, but what the attraction and when people come in why they put the credit card down is that they are attracted to that programming and they are excited about the show and they watch something and they get hooked in and watch you know been through 13 hours of a show 10 days and that’s a very unique proposition and we have to keep delivering on that and I think that there are a volume of high quality, original exclusive programming continues to grow and we measure it internally by hours of viewing per user and externally we would like you to look at net subscriber growth, because at the end of the day that’s -- that is the ultimate measure end of our house [ph]. I think when you -- several onlines you are talking about I mean, I think you’ve got now as far as I can tell atleast the biggest programming budget of any executive on the planet which is you know also part of the, the fun part of the job, but are there you know challenges and opportunities of scaling that budget, are there difficulties you raining [ph] too in terms of size or is this all just scaling quite smoothly? It’s remarkably smoothly considering we’ll have about 16 original scripted series this year growing to 31 next year. We have 10 feature films in production or just released or in pre production or post production. We’ve 30 kid series; these are kid’s properties that better produce four and only on Netflix. We have over a dozen feature documentaries, 10 standard comedy specials, 2 documentary series and not just a lot of volume because I think that if you want a lot of volume you could go to Utube for free and get a lot of volume. This is high quality stuff, somewhere last year we had 34 Emmy nominations, Oscar nominations, 10 Golden Globe nominations, so we’ve got. I mean this is product, this is programming that people want to watch. Folks in --- most in the New York series, I mean you can Aziz Ansari can no longer walk down the street in New York because of the success of Master of None. And just this quarter alone we’ve released Jessica Jones and Master of None which are both ranked by most critics as the best ten shows on television on all of television. So we’ve been able to scale this and maintain the quality and excitement of those original first shows like House of Cards and Orange Is the New Black. And I like digging in some of those series, but first since you just went through the size and scale of next year, are you still tracking towards almost $5 billion of program and amortization, $6 billion of cash spent that the company put up. Yes. And a $5 billion that probably would be the largest programming budget to your point earlier. That’s probably the first time we’ll cross that number. Yes, I was looking forward. Are you still learning new things about the ROI you are spending or at this point you know given your size and scale and the history doing this, are you at a point where you sort of really understand about the place? Well I mean I like to say we have -- differentially in this standard market place. I don’t think you understand you ever [Indiscernible] golf, he never quite mastered it and you want to keep learning and improving. And I think every time we launch a new country we learn more about that region. There is very little that you can learn about operating in Australia by launching in Mexico. But the more that we are aiming [ph] to these territories the more we understand their global audience. It’s been really encouraging to see something like the success of Narcos this year. Narcos, is a show that is 85% in Spanish, it’s produced with a French film company. It is shot in Columbia with Brazilian creators and Brazilian stars and it is usually popular in Germany and all over the world. So it is really a tint of first flavour of what global television really can be. And I think the more international, we are and the more global we are the more that we can get better and better at that which I think is the next phase of films entertainment. So lets talk about those originals a little bit. It was a pretty big jump to next year but for the ones that you have released in 2015, it did seem like I don’t know if you agree with this but a breakthrough year for originals. You had House of Cards and Orange Is The New Black and now this year you can really, put a few more up on the walls, Bloodline, Daredevil, Grace and Frankie its been a pretty aggressive year and then I just at Jessica Jones. I think the other thing you are seeing is a breadth of programming, right, so it’s not just geared. It’s not a type of programming which we’ve been trying to avoid you know being and having a show that’s considered a Netflix kind of show because I think while we’ve learned by having an incredible breadth of license programming all these years and then our DVD packet, our DVD days where we had over a 100,000 titles on DVD is that you get, you really get a sense of how diverse taste are and if you want to have programming that matters to people you have to have a breadth of programming and a lot of it to matter to everybody. So something people have loved and so that people who really loved Hemlock Grove are not the same people who love the House of Cards, but they are two big audiences. So this year we did Grace and Frankie and Longmire which were geared to older audiences and our typical programming head bend we’ve been pleased that they both have skewed broader and younger than they did on network, you know than Longmire did on the network and that Grace and Frankie skews more younger and female than we had forecasted going into it. So it’s great that we are able to go after a different broader demographic but still please another audience too. Well remember they both have different, that neither of them have a real super power. It sets us as goal [Indiscernible] as a marvel here. But in the viewing fight, they are neck and neck. And then we are going to see in Jessica Jones and then you see that in Jessica Jones we introduced the character of Luke Cage, and I think that’s going to be real exciting for viewers when he shows comes up this year because they are -- he’s the only one of the defenders who actually has a super power. So if you are really into the kind of book shows, it’s going to be a great one. Its was interesting sort of Nielsen is trying to do [Indiscernible] television measurement and it’s early days but some of the data’s they share with us, they picked a week and I assume this was a cherry picked week to make a point on that for it but there was a week earlier in this year probably in the spring and the number one show on all the television including multi platform, interesting that came off films in HPL, so it obviously outperformed it’s sort of live rating. Number two show on all of television including broadcast, including cable was a Netflix show. I’d say that because they don’t measure, I mean the way that they are measuring in this, I’ve read this the data myself too and I think what they are -- I am pleased to take the number two spot but I think its actually number one. Because they don’t measure all the devices, so they don’t they are trying and in a world where you had four networks and all the viewing was on television the sample sets can you know you can extrapolate a lot from the sample sets but in a world where we are on Netflix watching happens on 700 different SKUs around the world and they the viewing of any given show, the mix between what’s watched on a laptop and what’s watched on a big screen TV and what’s watched on our iPad, the different show to show depending on the demographics. I don’t think those sample sets are probably capturing the scale of the Netflix viewing. And does this make sense to you because I think when I talked [Indiscernible] I get the sense of all right Netflix has a couple of hits but really we’ve got you know these big shows on TV when the reality is I think now your shows are actually starting to get to some really big human audiences that people might not realize. You know when I’m not giving ratings, it’s super [Indiscernible] to tell you that the shows are great, are doing great but they are and they are among the most watched shows on television that is the interesting part of it. And I think it’s not -- you know a couple of years ago, it wasn’t that long ago that people would look to the internet as a convenience source of video, not a high quality source of video. But if you wanted to watch a quick video of Tiger Woods getting a hole in one or someone getting hit with a baseball bat, you know that was where you go to the Internet for. Now Netflix is not only producing some of the best programs on television, there are streaming in 4K in quality better than television. So it’s a change in the dynamics of viewing both when I say quality, I mean technical quality and logistic quality as well. Even though you’ve been broadening out the number of successful shows that you’ve had on the original side, I still find investors you know intensely focussed on the new originals that are coming out the next new heads. And he has talked about going to 31 shows next year, like what are you excited about as you think about 2016? Not that we can go through all 15… No, but I mean, I’ll give you some highlights. We’re really excited about the crown which is a show we are filming in the U.K. right now that is a it is the story of Queen Elizabeth starting from the day that her father was born and she abruptly becomes the queen that will follow her entire life. It’s written of the scripture written by Peter Morgan which was phenomenal. The show has got incredible pedigree, Steven Dolgee [ph] directing The Pilots. Great some directors directing these really lush huge scale television production that I think will surprise people in both in how it hugely entertaining it is but also there with the production quality which I think the world will be really impressed with. We’re filming a show here in town right now with Baz Luhrmann's, The Get Down which is the birth of hip hop in the late 70s in New York and it is Baz Luhrmann production and its and everything you come to expect for Baz Luhrmann production. So the first time Baz has worked in television we are really thrilled about that. We are also doing, we have two multi camera slick cons which will be first for us. One that’s called the Ranch, that we are filming right now, Warner Brothers in LA with Ashton Kutcher, Danny Masterson, Sam Elliot and Debra Winger starring in it, about a cattle ranching family in Colorado and the revival of Full House, Fuller House which is also a multi camera show we shot with an audience. So it’s both the breadth and scale that are attracting me to what we are doing next year that I’m really excited about. Even though we are getting into some new kinds of things I guess they are called Stranger things, if its super promising with these new film makers called the Duffer brothers which is used for kind of geared to their kind of cleaner [ph] audience but it’s suspense and horror that’s done at a very high production level. Fantastic. I mean, there are like -- there are like there was some recent brand affinity studies that put Netflix on top for kid for it involved the media brands for kids programming. We have like I mentioned 30 original shows this quarter alone. We launched the Popples, Glitter Force; we are having our real success with these legacy brands. You know these are the brands that we grew up onto and then now as the next generation is bringing up their kids they want to introduce some of the stuff that they like when they were younger, but the new version is up like My little Pony and those kind of shows. So we are investing heavily in those legacy brands. They are great toy brands with but the more important is that they are a great entertainment brands. I was personal curious like would you look at share by John [ph] or is [Indiscernible] something that’s taking more share of that SKUs, I mean that SKU is growing very fast. No, but it’s always kind of held its own. It’s a very -- I’d say it’s a segment of overall viewing that happens in every household. So if you’ve got kids in the household there is pretty good chance that they are watching that flick, so you know about half of our households are engaging in kids content regularly. And that’s a global number. So I do think that its an important thing that’s why we are producing programming with some of the biggest content producers in that space and we will continue to and like out 30 original shows. Now I think the turning point is that the scale of viewing is such that it supports the sale of license product which is what I think was a strategic advantage of networks before was that you want to sell toys and while you watch your cartoon on Nickelodeon because that’s what kids are watching and I think that is shipping and used more likely to be just as show on Netflix. That’s interesting. When we think about new areas of potential customer investment and I think on the last conference call there was some discussion of like shows and it was [Indiscernible]. No, the question it was sort of -- laughing because the question was meant to I think clear the air which was that we weren’t getting into entirely new. So we definitely are not getting into -- we say it again, we are definitely not getting into entirely new. When I think this question was -- the form of the question are we going to compete with Vice. So first of all Vice is a great very good brand in their documentary space and they are moving into a entirely new space with HBO. We are not moving into a entirely new space with anybody. So when I said Vice, I mean because you know provocative, interesting, edgy documentary, we do a lot of that. So we do could provide some space probably but if there is plenty of room in that space. But we’re definitely not getting into the news gathering space which I think is fairly commoditized and not particularly in line our kind of on-demand model. So like sports, the beauty of news is that its life. And where people come in the Netflix, where I think they are controlling the on-demand part of it. I know this has been sort of asked and answered; it might be a while before its really addressable for you, but just for this audience, long-term interest exports. The reason I think is coming up is because I think people will think about Netflix is a substitution for cable. So, how can Netflix has sports? So I don’t need to have my cable. I think people are asking that because they are frustrated with the size that their cable bill every month and they mostly continue to do it for sport. And I think its really for me, I’m not saying that we would never do sports, but just like news I’m not attract. The on-demand doesn’t make the sports experience better for the viewer, right. It’s the live. So you want to watch. Even everyone else is watching. When you have never won the game and the same time everyone else does. So it’s isn’t core viewing strategy for us. I do think there’s the other problem which is that leagues have all the pricing power in that business forever. So I don’t – if there was a model where we would create our sports league, that might be interesting and ESPN with X game. But it’s a pretty unusual thing to be able to pull off and it’s not really, but we’re chasing. But that was what would take to get me in the sports. So let’s move on to licensing international, vertically, integrated media companies that I cover at on cable networks are change in their tone to investors, right. So they’re saying perhaps they sold too much to Netflix, maybe it wasn’t a best idea to help, few will compete online with your platform. Have your conversations in relationship with the studios has been shifting as sort of we’ve heard from a top down level? What you’re seeing is a fundamental change in consumer behavior. So people who use to watch television on scheduled are now watching on-demand product like Netflix. They’re watching, it’s an SVOD shift not just a Netflix shift. And the studios and networks who make that programming make a lot of money selling it -- they use to make a lot of money selling it to the programming where people use to watch it. And now their belief, the viewer has moved here. So, you want to make money, you better sell it here. So it’s like it’s really – its not developing a new confident, it just a different set of buyers. The vertical integrated part that’s something you guys, you can explore with the other speakers today, because it’s a very difficult thing to pull off, because in particular I think in the media space. But vertically integrated companies are not really built to optimize. If you’re building a studio to sell content you should be building to sell it to the highest bidder, even if it’s not your parent company. And I think that’s the Rob I think in vertical integrated media companies. Fox produces the most successful show on ABC, Modern Family. So they’ve reconcile that selling to a competitors. It’s not like its unusual thing selling to a direct competitor. So selling to Netflix is no different than Fox selling to ABC. But I do think by saying in broad strokes, maybe we shouldn’t assault the Netflix. I think that’s obviously a foolish thing to say, because the billion of dollars of benefit they’ve realized from Netflix being an off net buyer have been – won’t have been replace with anything else. Prices weren’t originally raising until the new buyer came to the market. And we’re the new buyer that help them raise prices across the competitive landscape and that’s what sellers wants. How do you manage your portfolio? When I think about sort of on acquire side you’ve got output deal store, I think with as CBS, FOX and Fox runs into 17 and CBS still runs for quite a while. And you in the past have said, look, we’re not in the output deal business anymore. So in a way, you’re sort of waiting for those deals unwind networks, on the other side, sort of waiting for the deals to unwind to their more flexibly. How do sort of plan for the future on the acquired side with sort of just uncertainty in the environment? Well, its pretty mapable, meaning as our commitments roll off in our ramp up periods for original programming and global license shows ramp up, we can – you can definitely map it out on the spreadsheet, what’s coming up and what’s coming on. It’s very hard to know what’s going to be the next big thing, right. Especially the things that have not been even conceived yet in future output deals. I’ve been mostly disillusion in the output deals, because the success ratio of any given network is not that great, meaning that they have their share hits and their share misses. And I’d rather pay more for the hits and avoid the misses. And I think they would do. But I have the benefit in the second window being able to do that. So I want to make sure we don’t lose that advantage of having that. We’re going to buy in like a window focusing on the things that work and avoiding the things that didn’t. So the AMC deals one I think AMC, we have a great partnership with them. Josh and Charlie are great friends. But the truth of it is and that whole entire output deal that we do with the MCL those year Walking Dead was the best thing to come of it. And we’ll have Waking Dead as a runner series show, if they allow the upward deal. And Mad Men is an example we licensed from Lion’s Gate and breaking that we license from Sony. So that deal, the output of it all was not that great for us and that’s why we just. And as long – with long with our other output deals we’re most of it in the mix buyers. So we thought about more for the hits and lesser maybe nothing for some other rest. I think one thing that investors have been concern about tell us that you’ve done? Yes, understood. Sometimes you find things that hit our Netflix, it actually didn’t work here. So, I think when I get back sometimes investors are concern that you’ve done too good job, right. You’ve acquired lot of great Hollywood content that what might been inefficient pricing because it was before they knew you would be so big or they knew you’d be so successful and the uses would be so high. And so, one thing that we all thing about is if we mark-to-market all the deals that you’ve done historically today, you might be paying a lot more or would you not by paying a lot more. How is that going to work? Remember, it’s a competitive buying situation, so we didn’t have to pay – we have to pay more than next than the next bidder, right. So they think like -- people think about this is unlimited top side of the content. No, you just paying more than anyone else would. So it’s not that it. You’re trying to forecast how you’re going to get a ton of viewing or your business is going to XYZ. If they could guarantee that; I think people will be lining up to pay more. But they really can’t guarantee that and they’re programming isn’t necessary exclusively responsible for the growth of the business in any one show. This is the way I know David was going to be here later this after and the way he talked about how everyone drop this big business and his content. That’s true. I mean they built. We built the big business for the great service in a lot of content and when we – we just figured out is that some of the content not all of it but some of the content is remarkably interchangeable. And in the case of Discovery, when our deal came up with Discovery which had a very premium price, because in the cable world, the people – the people themselves would be surveyed and they would say, what are the reasons you pay for the cable and Discovery would rank really high on that chart. So therefore, Discovery would charge cable operators more for the channel. Well, in a world of equilibrium we’d say relative to watching, we’ll readily pay for the programming relative to the watching of that programming, because that’s really why people subscribe and retain, that they weren’t paying – they weren’t watching Discovery any more than they were watch any or scripts or History channel. So when I look at the sports that premium that was placed on the product we did not renew the deals and that went elsewhere and we replace that were other programming that was similar that -- this is much watching at a much lower price. So I think there is a premium that associated with the brand but eventually there has to be some equilibrium, in others if you have premium brand you have to deliver the viewing too. And by the way, I think that discovery will do that. I think what happened – what I think will happen from that Discovery we’ll make more hard to replace content, they’ll make more content that distinguishes that brand to the consumer too not just to the cable operator. I think this sort of discussion leads right into the who is the competitor, it seemed over the summer they were fine, everything that was coming out. And they’ve certainly really ramp the investment paying just a ton on programming. Are they driving the price of higher for everybody and do you think there going to be more serious competitor going forward? I don’t know. I mean their ownership structure is confounding, so in terms of the amount of money they would spend for programming outside of the ownership of the three owning of the three networks at Donam [ph] which seems surprising to me there’s been so much money directly with their competitor, but they’re probably are driving up pricing on themselves and on Amazon, but we’re pretty strategic about we’re chasing and we were willing to pay for it, so we have discipline enough to let some go when the price points become irrational and wait for the next one. And now, in terms of the competitive, today, I don’t know endorse it but if you track third-party data, the stand buying data that came out just today shows that Amazon and Hulu are pretty flat and we’ve grown 60 basis points to 37% of our honor with American traffic where Amazon and Hulu are both, John I forget, because its really just odd in way up here. We are 37%, Hulu the 22.7%, Amazon 3.1% and basically flat just slightly up. So, you started talking about this a little bit of top, but which was international and maybe we’ll have time for a question on movies. But on the international side, how is as this global launch been impacting your programming strategy and anything sort of remarkable out of it that you would say you’re common on? First of all, we were very excited about the success of Narcos around the world; I think that we’re ramping up non-English local language programming. We just finished shooting a series in France called Marseille with starting Gerard Depardieu that is – that I think is going to be very large European audience, I believe we’ll get a lot of viewing in the U.S. We’ve got more than a million U.S subscribers who watch French Television regular. So it brings us a lot of production scale when we produce content in France. I hope we’ll do more. We are moving forward on a series called Suburra in Italy from the guys who made Gomorrah. We had a great success with Club De Cuervos earlier this year, our first Mexican series for Mexico. Working so, its working with great local talent, local producers, local cast and again in local language, so I think that will and I hope that we’ll have an original local language production in all of our major markets in the next year or two. Are you finding – we’ll go back to your earlier international market, are you starting to hit a saturation point where program as a percentage of revenue starts the level off as their subscribers sort of hit a certain level. Or is there any kind of relationship? We’re all trying to figure out how much hit has been programs where not just in a margin basis, , we’re also trying to figure out how much market share you can win based on how much you can invest in local programming around the world? So, I think I don’t know about it yet, we are trying, I mean, that’s the big question and certainly too. We’re trying to figure out. When we invest in programming the point of diminishing returns would be if we’re not seeing hours per viewer growth. So, right now, we’re investing, we’re seeing the hours for users grow, median hours for viewers grow and not just average, because the average will give you this like the outliers too. And so, we’re seeing that we’re still getting a good return on investment relative to engagement which generally is a good indicator of retention and then people come in and loved the programming, spend more and more time of their day with Netflix and they retain longer. So when you go into it, now when you get into the other new launch which is the local versus the global programming, what’s interesting to me is a market like Japan, that Japan is our first big Asian market that we’ve been in. Japan is mostly Japanese maybe Asian content market, so meaning that 90% of the box office in Japan is Japanese. And 95% of the TV watching in Japan is Japanese television and yet we’re doing 30% to 50% watching with non-Japanese programming on Japan so far. And the offering is pretty split. So we have a lot of Japanese programming and yet Bill Murray’s Christmas special they are just launching this week is in the top 10 in Japan. The Daredevil, Narcos, Jessica Jones is very popular in Japan. Beasts of No Nation when it premiered on Netflix, was the number one most watched movie in Japan when we first launched, so and American independent films rarely travel to Japan. So I think that this very concentrated local viewing is more a reflection of the business climate than it is of local taste. When you think about obviously some of the big launches last year, Germany and France, you’ve always in the past talked about well, over the course of two or three years we modulate our program and we build it up until we get the market right. How far along would you say you are in Germany and France in terms of fine tuning your programming strategy? Well, we’ve been thrilled with what’s been going on in Germany and France. We just mentioned that we’re past two million subscribers in that region and I think the programming strategy was greater than they’ve really have been attracted to their original programming. So in any given night, eight to 10 of the top 10 shows watched in Germany and France are the Netflix original shows and programming that we’re premiering in the region from other network. So, I think we’re getting it right and I think adding local flavor to it like we did in, just recently did in Mexico. I mean, we operate in Latin America for four years, before we launched an original language show and now we’re moving into local language programming in France up to just a year. So we’ve been accelerating the pace of it and I think it’s an important part of the regional flavor of Netflix. So we want people to love Netflix because they love the programming on Netflix and part of that means local language programming versus subtitle and dub shows and we want to be part of that as well. And I think we can, we have the scale to do that. When you launch in Southern Europe is there some way for you to give us a sense of how much of the programming that you need to hedge you already acquired versus sort of what’s left to go, because you often talk in the past about you know we buy in advance of market launches? Yes. No. I think what the nice thing in all these launches is that the thinnest library ever is in any of those countries is the first day we launch. So we literally are adding programming every day from the launch day in each of these territories. So we try to keep a lot of dry powder for licensing powder so that we can pivot in the market if we have too much drama and comedy or too many movies, TV shows and we change license regularly, so its – we still been following that path which is launching with enough titles to attract subscribers and then adding to that everyday. And what’s really changed is that, I’ve been in attendance at everyone of these international launches expect for Japan, I couldn’t get the Japan. But in those launches like we did in France and Germany we did, I think 137 interviewers over a four-day period -- days of press in each country and moved on, moved on. And the remarkable thing was Italy and Spain and Portugal we just did so all those other ones basically is describing Netflix, 137 interviews, four days of non-stop describing and defending Netflix to the press. In Spain and Italy and Portugal it was all about the excitement about Narcos and Daredevil and the original shows they’ve not been otherwise available in the territory before. So, these original programs have acted as a brand ambassador for us around the world and these territories we haven’t been operating in, in a way that has made our launches much more successful and much more focus on the quality of program than what is on demand. What don’t you have The Walking Dead, why don’t you have the – so the focus is really been about the enthusiasm for those original shows. The great positive reception of the original shows has been really, really great, particular sense we haven’t had the benefit of the marketing campaign, everything else we done inside of our operating territories. I look at Japan as something as a test for the rest of Asia-Pac, if you could do it Japan than you can do it anywhere. Yes. Its probably a reasonable assumption that Japan would be toughest of the markets, big relative to how inferior the market is for programming and local day, but then a lot of media have not done well in Japan. So it should be a good test that if Japan does well, the Asia would be great, because the other territories would be much easier. I think so, I mean, we’re ready in terms of we have a great suite of original programming. We have a great suite of globally license programming. We’ve been investing in regional license programming for the territories, gearing up local language assets and local payment methodologies and all those things, so yes, I mean, that feels good about as we’ve launched in other -- launches so. So when we think about movies, its something that – its sort of new, and its interesting and its exciting and I think Reed has really mentioned to me as still something of experiment stage yet to be proved out, you’ve talked about a lot of movies that you have in production. How you’re feeling about movies in the categories so far. And in this golden age of television, right and Netflix is mostly talked about our great TV shows, a third of watching is still movies on Netflix. And our movies are old. I mean, most of our movies on Netflix, even when we have the first tail window, they’re 10 months after theatrical. Some of those deals are nine years after theatrical. So even with that, people are watching movies in very big, very resilient 30%. So I’m mostly enthused about the idea of improving the movie mix by doing originals versus doing more output, because I think more studio output just means more 10 month old movies. So if I had every deal that HBO show time, people would say, Netflix movies are old and they’ll be right. So, what we’re trying to do is trying to say, look, instead of spending another $1 billion on a movie output, we should spend – invest the $1 billion in original movie production, movies that you would see in the theatre. So, the Beasts of No Nation is an example of an movie that would be in the theatre, right. Movie on a remarkable scale, it scored hugely with critics, just got five award nominations for best picture, best director, best actor, best supporting actor, best cinematography. I mean, it s a really great film, a competitive film and it premiered on Netflix, and its only a Netflix. So movies in the output deals not only are they 10 months old, they’re widely available on DVD and DOD and hotels, an airplanes, so its not really a differentiator for our service having that upward deal. Now I’d say that knowing that we are entering into an output deal with Disney, which we’re thrilled about, because Disney is a whole different kind of an output. I was the Director of the Disney output because Disney is a solely differentiated brand among movie studios. They have some key franchises that you know with consumers. So you say we have the Star Wars movies that mean something. When you say we have the Avengers, and with the marvel of movies that means something. When you say we have Disney animated features that mean something to consumers. When you say I have Paramount movies that means absolutely nothing to most consumers. So our investment in Disney is different than any other awkward deal. I don’t think we’ll enter into large out scale upward deals in the U.S. anymore. We do think that well the fees that we are producing larger scale movies, original movies for Netflix that we are premiering and keeping exclusively on Netflix. We think next week we did release Ridiculous 6 on December 11. This is Adam Sandler's next movie. For the last 20 years Adam Sandler has done a movie a year in the box office to tremendous success, year after year after year. So when you say you have a Adam Sandler movie that’s a movie that everyone knows is a theatrical movie, he has never made a movie for television. And what’s really fun about watching this growth of Adam and watching I think people are going to really love Ridiculous 6 if you love Adam Sandler. And when that people do that he is one of the most bankable dependable stars on Netflix around the world. So of all those 20 movies he has put out over the last 20 years, if we license them in any window, in any country they will immediately launch up into the top 10 in that country. People love Adam Sandler around the world. And I know the press loves to be beat up on him, but I’m telling you that not only pixels that just came out, the people continue to write that the movie is a flop somehow. It’s an $80 million movie that done over a quarter of a billion dollars in the box office. And he’s hugely popular and just emerging in Latin America. Remember we are a global company. Many of us had -- outside of the U.S. so we are looking at him as if he is a global superstar. And it is funny just like [Indiscernible] but the movie blended is the biggest, one of the biggest movies in the history of Venezuela, bigger than Titanic and Avatar. So I mean when you look at these numbers you look at like his box office in Brazil, the box office in Mexico are enormous. So we are really excited about the global audience for Adam and for Ridiculous 6 and we just wrap production on his second film for us called The Do Over. We are filming a movie right now with Brad Pitt called War Machine that we are really excited about. We have upcoming Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon 2. We have Pee-wee's Big Holiday coming up with the Return of Pee-wee Herman produced by Judd Apatow and we are like I said we have about 10 movies right now that are in production that will be released by end of 2016 and we’ll enter into production agreements with for more. We are really excited about the category and about bringing it earlier to consumers and exclusively on Netflix. Well I’ve got about 15 more questions. I’m sure the audience had some and we ran out of time. So we’ll leave some for next year. Ted, thanks so much for your time.
