Sharp Drop In PC Sales Appears Ominous For Intel - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha IDC is reporting that PC sales declined 6.7% Y/Y in Q1. The decline in global PC sales has been well-talked about. However, Gartner Group's belief that the shift toward lighter notebook PCs will continue appears ominous for Intel. IDC reports that PC sales declined 6.7% Y/Y to 68.5 million units in Q1 2015: Following a strong second half of 2014, which benefited from the tailwind of the Windows XP refresh and pockets of price-driven consumer activity, the Q1 market faced multiple headwinds - including inventory build-up of Windows Bing based notebooks, commercial slow down following the XP refresh and constrained demand in many regions due to currency fluctuations and unfavorable economic indicators. As a result, growth and volume declined with Q1 shipments below 69 million units, the lowest recorded volume since Q1 2009. The following chart outlines worldwide PC sales: Among the top 5 PC vendors, only Dell (-6.3%) and Acer (-7%) experienced sales declines. Unit sales of other vendors outside the top 5 declined by nearly 18%; this implies that smaller vendors are finding it more difficult to compete. That said, U.S. PC sales declined only 1%. Some estimate that after the launch of Windows 10, pent up demand for the replacement of older PCs will be fulfilled and stem the decline in U.S. PC sales. According to Jay Chou , Senior Research Analyst, Worldwide PC Trackers, pricing pressure is causing vendors to price premium units in mid-level pricing tiers. Along those lines, Gartner estimates that mobile PCs (notebooks, convertibles, Windows tablets) grew, and expects the trend toward light notebooks with tablet functionality to continue. Meanwhile, Galen Gruman of infoworld.com is more gloomy on sales of both PCs and tablets. As indicators, he points to the stall in iPad sales and the low replacement rate of tablets in general; consumers lack the need to replace a tablet after they have already bought one. For a meaningful jump in hardware sales, Gruman believes PC vendors need to enter the phablet space : If PC and tablet makers want a huge jump in hardware sales, they need an equivalent of the iPhone 6 . Its compelling new hardware excited millions, while the iPad Air 2 did not. Both run iOS 8, which has really nice features like Handoff and better business communications , but it was the iPhone 6 hardware that netted people's dollars. I have a dismal outlook for the U.S. economy in general. Durable goods orders declined 1.4% in February, while orders of computers and electronic products declined 0.1%. With the wind down of the government's $4 trillion quantitative easing program, durable goods orders could get worse. That does not bode well for Intel which received 60% of its revenue from its PC client unit for the quarter-ended December 27, 2014: Intel, along with Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ), is the leader in sales of semiconductors for personal computers. Business desktop PCs were hurt the most amid the decline in global PC sales. There is a scenario where Intel could maintain its market share in PCs, yet its average sales price ("asp") could decline due to a change in the mix of business. The price list for desktop PC processors ranges from $999 for i7 processor Extreme Edition (20M cache) to an $86 entry level price for Pentium processor (3M cache). Meanwhile, Intel's system-on-chips for mobile devices have four tiers determined by [i] whether the chips go into smartphones, tablets or notebooks and [ii] whether they come with WiFi capabilities only, come with discrete modems or integrated modems. The highest performance tier - Atom x5 and x7 "Cherry Trail" based processors - start at $350 and go into more powerful tablets and notebooks like the new Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Surface 3 . The trend toward lower cost notebook computers that require less processing power and potentially, cheaper processors, could hurt overall revenue. That said, Intel recently lowered its Q1 revenue projection by $900 million due to weaker demand for business desktop PCs. That revenue shortfall could be simply a decline in desktop business PCs, change in product mix, or both. Secondly, any encroachment on PCs from mobile devices such as the iPhone 6 - as Galen Gruman intimated - could hurt Intel further. The company's mobile & communications division had sales of -$6 million last quarter; the division is currently a loss leader as Intel attempts to build market share in the mobile space. The decline in the sales of PCs and the trend toward cheaper notebooks requiring less processing power does not bode well for Intel.
