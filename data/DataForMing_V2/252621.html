ETF Hub Dec  1 2015, 19:17 ET | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor The WSJ reports Yahoo's (NASDAQ: YHOO ) board plans to explore a sale of the company's core Internet business when it meets from Wednesday-Friday.

All the hate on Mayer is ridiculous.. Look at her history.. This woman is a top of the line executive with a forward looking approach..

I'm willing to admit this may work better then I originally thought.   It will depend on the price management gets for the core but it does solve a couple of the issues surrounding yhoo.
