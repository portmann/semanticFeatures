Play Alibaba Through Yahoo - Cramer's Lightning Round (7/20/15) | Seeking Alpha Jul. 21, 2015  6:07 AM ET  |  Includes: BABA , CSCO , HZNP , NLY , UA , VGR , WWE , YHOO by: SA Editor Mohit Manghnani Vector Group (NYSE: VGR ): Cramer likes the stock on the fundamental basis. Horizon Pharma (NASDAQ: HZNP ): The last 2 acquisitions were brilliant. If the stock pulls back again, buy it as there is no point recommending it near all-time high. Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ): It's got a terrific new CEO and Cramer thinks the stock is a buy as it has a good yield. Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ): Stay away from Alibaba. The best way to play it is through Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ). Under Armour (NYSE: UA ): The stock is at the 52-week high. Cramer likes the company but he advises to wait for a pullback before buying the stock. World Wrestling Entertainment (NYSE: WWE ): Cramer is too cold on the stock and feels that it does not have a lot to offer.
