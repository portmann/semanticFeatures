Click to print (Opens in new window) Though we’re living in an increasingly interconnected, digital age, perhaps you drive a car that’s a bit more… analog. For those Ford owners who have older vehicles but want to be linked up with new technology, the carmaker is offering a software update for five million cars that will allow owners to activate Apple’s Siri Eyes-Free feature. The option allows drivers with iPhones to make phone calls, send texts, set reminders, check the weather, get directions and tell the car to play that new Adele album everyone is apparently obsessed with. All the stuff you might want to do while driving without taking your hands off the wheel or being distracted by a screen. â€œSYNC [also known as MyFord Touch], Fordâ€™s entertainment and communications system, was designed to be flexible and updatable, just like other mobile technologies, so our customers are able to get the most out of their smartphones while behind the wheel,â€? said Sherif Marakby, director, Ford Electronics and Electrical Systems Engineering in a press release. â€œSiri Eyes-Free is another great voice-activated feature that not only adds convenience but helps our customers keep their eyes on the road and hands on the wheel.â€? Some drivers have had access to the Siri Eyes-Free option for a few months, but today Ford is confirming its wider availability: owners of cars from 2011 on that have MyFord Touch (or SYNC in some areas) will be able to download the update from Ford’s website .
