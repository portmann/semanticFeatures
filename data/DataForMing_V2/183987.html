Calculating Alibaba's Video Streaming Potential - Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) | Seeking Alpha Their soon to be launched video streaming service has a great deal of potential due to its combination of Western/Chinese content and Alibaba's strong brand. Alibaba's core business by itself is a cash producing machine, growing by nearly ~30% a year, but still trading at a ridiculously low P/E of 20. Amidst the chaos of Alibaba's (NYSE: BABA ) continued stock price plunge, some promising fundamental developments have been entirely ignored by the market. One of these is the news that Alibaba has launched a video streaming service, charging $57/year for it. This is actually a huge opportunity for Alibaba and they have the differentiating factors necessary to move the needle on their earnings and revenues. It's true that Alibaba has a lot of non-core businesses it invests in/owns that don't contribute all that much to their earnings. Alibaba's overall performance is still almost entirely determined by how well their e-commerce platform does, regardless of their smart TV business, their cloud business, plane ticket booking sites, etc. Most of these side businesses simply don't contribute much in the form of earnings and they often generate losses in the short term. However, I believe Alibaba's video streaming business is a game changer - largely because they signed a massive movie deal with NBCUniversal (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) (NASDAQ: CMCSK ), which gives them a great deal of western content to bring to Chinese consumers. These include huge blockbusters like Minions and Jurassic World. Of course, Alibaba also has popular Chinese content as well, but this Western content is really the key differentiator and why I think this side business has such a great deal of potential. The language in the press release also leads me to believe Alibaba may have received some favorable terms in paying for the content - the chairman stated that "this partnership will continue to increase our reach in the market as well as driving additional revenues for us in Asia. " Notice how the revenues are added on second, almost as an after thought. The real benefit for NBCUniversal here is that they build even more mind share among Chinese consumers (perhaps hoping to gain an edge over competing studios like Disney (NYSE: DIS )), not that they get a large stream of revenue from Alibaba licensing the content. Alibaba also has other excellent Western shows due to its deals with Lionsgate such as Mad Men. Moreover, Western content and products in general tend to be very popular with the growing Chinese middle class, giving Alibaba a key edge in drawing customers to its video streaming service instead of to its competitors, such as Baidu's (NASDAQ: BIDU ) Qiyi. Now, I'll get to the actual numbers. $57 a year is a pretty low price and the monthly price is $6 a month (which equates to $72 a year). I'm going to assume the majority of people get the yearly subscription and estimate that the average revenue per customer will be $60 a year. At this price range, all levels of the middle class are able to afford the service, though the rural/low income populations will most likely not be able to. Right now the number of middle class hovers around 400 million and is estimated by McKinsey to reach 650 million by 2022. That's a massive addressable market. I'm also assuming that Alibaba will only find success in China with its streaming service. The positives for Alibaba include that it essentially has the best streaming service on the market (due to its combination of high quality Western and Chinese content), so they have a first mover's advantage because the VOD market is still fairly new in China (so long as they get it out of beta soon) and a strong brand/mind share among Chinese consumers. I'm also going to be using Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) as my point of comparison since it was also the first VOD service in America (but did not have the benefits of a very strong brand, unlike Alibaba). Around 50% of Americans consider themselves middle class, which equates to around 150 million people. Of those 150 million, 41.4 million are Netflix subscribers. Note that a lot more people probably watch/have access to Netflix due to sharing among friends/family. Alibaba may apply more stringent sharing controls than Netflix, resulting in a higher percentage of subscribers. But I want to be as conservative as possible in my calculations, so I won't account for this or the fact that Netflix's American subscriber account is growing. Regardless, this equates to 28% of middle class people subscribed to Netflix. Applying this to China, you get 182 million potential customers for Alibaba's video streaming service. That's around $10 billion in additional revenue by 2022. This would already higher than Netflix's current revenues by 67%. Netflix's operating margin for streaming services in 2012 (before they started investing heavily in original content and expanding internationally) was around 11%. Again, it's important to note here that the margin is dependent on the negotiations. Netflix was not the massive behemoth it currently is in 2012, giving it little negotiating power. On the other hand, Alibaba is a massive behemoth, with a tremendous amount of scale and negotiating power. This is likely to help margins. Essentially, Alibaba has set their streaming service up to be a multi billion-dollar business within six years, even when using conservative assumptions. The Chinese middle class also won't just stop growing in 2022 - so that leaves the opportunity for continued revenue and net income growth. I don't think investors are really realizing that Alibaba's video streaming service has potential, especially given the beating the stock has received. The potential valuation for such a business is around half of Alibaba's current market cap, if we again compare it to Netflix using revenue metrics (with Netflix having a market cap of $45 billion, and Alibaba a market cap of 150 billion). I'm a bit skeptical that it's actually worth that much (since I don't think Netflix is worth $45 billion), but it's easy to see that the potential to move Alibaba's earnings and valuation is huge. None of this is priced into Alibaba's stock or future estimates. I would in fact argue that current estimates alone are enough reason to buy the stock hand over fist - a forward P/E of 20 for a company growing at ~30% is absurd. If that isn't good enough for investors, I encourage investors to consider what I've said about the streaming service's potential.
