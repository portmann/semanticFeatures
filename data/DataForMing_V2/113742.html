Should Apple Investors Worry About China? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha China has ramped up to become a significant market for Apple. The market data doesn't support that the average retail investor in China is harmed. The recent collapse in the Chinese stock market has investors clamoring over the impact to tech stocks. In fact, the biggest stock of them all might have the most to worry about. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) saw the stock move to new highs following a huge jump in Q215 revenue from Greater China. When the news talks about the $3 trillion lost in Chinese stock markets, it fails to mention the full facts. For several reasons listed below, the true impact from China is being overstated. Should Apple investors really worry about China's stock market collapse impacting the stock? The potential China impact is very clear from recent quarterly results. For Q215, Apple saw the majority of growth from the Greater China region alone. Per the numbers below, China became the second largest operating segment in the quarter blowing past Europe. In fact, China accounted for $7 billion of the revenue growth equivalent to over 50% of the total YoY growth. The China region had a bump during the March quarter as the new iPhone 6 became generally available in the region. The Q315 numbers for the June quarter will provide a bunch better indication of the general demand equation for the region. Note that the all-important December quarter only produced roughly 20% of revenue from the region. Clearly, the issue with China is in regard to the numbers built into expectations and not from past numbers. The bump up in China revenue will only include the March quarter and potentially a similar but smaller increase in the June quarter. From most data points, the China issue is being overstated. The stock market is only down to the levels of mid-March. In theory, a Chinese consumer looking at buying an Apple product would be no worse off than back during the March quarter. Some are far worse off from buying Chinese stocks at the peak and some are better off from selling stocks at levels in June that were much higher than March. Of course, any consumer jumping into the market in June is worse off and could delay an iPhone purchase. These incremental users might opt to not purchase an iPhone now. The impact to the FY15 numbers appears minimal and mostly contained to the September quarter. Even if lower than expected demand from China cuts earnings targets for FY16 by a rather large 10%, Apple would still earn around $8.80 for the year. The stock trades at an enterprise value of roughly 11x those estimates. Even in a worse case scenario, Apple is extremely cheap at these levels. Remember that we're talking about Chinese consumers that would be incremental buyers of an iPhone delaying purchases of the phone. Ultimately, the majority of these consumers will build out of any hole caused by the market collapse to become an iPhone owner in the future. Even if the Chinese stock market collapse causes a nearly 10% hit to FY16 earnings for Apple, the stock is already extremely cheap. The hit wouldn't do much to impact a large stock buyback that could buy more shares on any hit to the stock than if it had to buy at levels previously above $130. Heck, Apple could implement a large enough buyback with a net cash balance in excess of $150 billion to juice the earnings enough to make up for a short fall from China. China is a potential problem for Apple meeting analyst estimates, but it isn't a problem for the current stock valuation. Investors should use dips caused by China to buy the stock.
