Apple Reportedly Shelving Live-TV Streaming Service For Now â€“ Consumerist Whoops! It looks like portions of our site are being blocked! Check your browser settings or contact your network administrator. The last we heard – just four months ago – Apple planned to offer a live-TV streaming service in 2016 . But apparently a lot can change in that amount of time, as a new report suggests the company has scrapped the venture — at least for now.Â  Bloomberg, citing people with knowledge of the matter, reports that Apple has suspended plans for a live-TV option after running into issues with different media companies. The crux of the problemÂ reportedly comesÂ down to the planned $30 to $40 per month cost of the service, with the networks wanting more money for their programming. Apple’s plans were more or less confirmed on Tuesday by CBS CEO Les Moonves who said during the Business Insider Ignition conference that the service was “on hold.” Despite the setback, Moonves, whose company was reportedly partially responsible for Apple’s previous live-TV delay, said he expects the company to have the service up and running eventually. â€œThis will happen,â€? Moonves said. â€œIt has four major networks and 10 cable networks, letâ€™s say, and the price point will be in the $30s, $30 to $35, $40 maybe. People will not be spending money on channels they donâ€™t want to watch.â€? While Apple puts the live-TV service on the back burner, Bloomberg reports that it will concentrate on being a platform for media companies to sell directly to customers through its App Store and developing new entertainment content for its Apple TV set-top boxes.
