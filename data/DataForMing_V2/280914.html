Best December For Ford Truck Sales Since 2005 - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha We like to track sales of pickup trucks as they are often a sign of strength or weakness in the small business and construction sectors. Based on this idea, both appear to be doing well. In the latest release for December, Ford (NYSE: F ) announced that sales of F-Series trucks totaled 85.2K, which represented an increase of 14.6% from last December's total and the largest December y/y increase since 2011. This month's sales total also makes this December the best month for Ford truck sales since 2005 and the third best December on record. To put this into perspective, sales in December 2015 were more than double the total of December 2008. For all of 2015, sales of Ford F-Series totaled 780K, which is the strongest year for sales since 2005. In the year, sales of F-series trucks grew 3.5%, rebounding from 2014's decline of 1.3% when sales were hampered by delays due to the redesign of the new F-150.
