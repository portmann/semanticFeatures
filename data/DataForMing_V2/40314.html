Apple: The Bull Comes Back - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha In my previous article, Bear Case From A Bull , I thought it would be useful to come up with the most potent potential vulnerabilities to Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) from a bull's perspective. It is important for an investor to examine both positive and negative views on a stock, assuming they are reasonable. The idea was to examine the factors that might negatively affect Apple's share price in the long run. I gave four that I thought most important (though I did not label the first two, as I probably should have.) Here I will reply to them with the bull case. Once again, however, I will try to avoid gratuitous and hyperbolic arguments. Margins are always a concern for any company, but particularly so for Apple as analysts seem to be fixated on them. They are exceptionally high for a hardware company. The last reported gross margin for Apple was 39.3%, whereas for Hewitt-Packard (NYSE: HPQ ) just 24%, while Lenovo ( OTCPK:LNVGF ) recently reported 13.1%. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) were at 65% and 62%, respectively, but they sell software/services, not hardware. The chart in the previous article shows how Apple margins dipped in 2012-2013 and how the share price recovered after margins rebounded. The share price retraction was influenced by revenue and earnings slowdowns as well, but obviously they were all related. Earning in particular were greatly depressed by the drop in gross margin. So this will always be an area of great interest to Apple investors, but a few things should alleviate any short-term concern. First, the success of the iPhone 6 and the higher-priced/higher-margin 6 Plus have driven margins up again. Sales of the Apple Watch line seem to have gotten of to a great start and the margins for these products are almost assuredly very high. (Although they may be held down a bit at first by high development costs.) These are trends that are not likely to reverse significantly near term. Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, recently released analysis of the results from its research on Apple for the fiscal quarter that ended March 28, 2015. They report: Together the flagship iPhone 6 and 6 Plus share of total iPhone sales increased relative to the December 2014 quarter," said Josh Lowitz, CIRP Partner and Co- Founder. "ASP as predicted by our US Weighted Average Retail Price (US-WARP) may decline, however. The initial unanticipated strength of the 6 Plus has moderated somewhat , with the 6 Plus to 6 ratio declining from 2:3 to 2:5 in the most recent quarter, though this is still a strong showing for the super-premium model. However, it is important to note that the data is for USA only. Strong sales in China are likely to pull up the 6 Plus in the mix, as the larger format is reportedly more popular there. And even in the USA, the fact that the two new models together are a larger percentage of sales than last years flagship 5s, will continue to keep margins high. This year's double flagship comprise roughly 78% of iPhone sales, compared to last year's flagship 5s at only 62%. So - for the time being at least - I do not think investors have much to fear in the area of margins. It would take serious setbacks to iPhone sales to bring these down significantly. iPhone Sales - Stagnation or Shrinkage Margins to a degree, and even more so growth can be considered as results or functions of the other two items on the list: iPhone sales and Apple Watch success or failure. For this reason, growth will be discussed last. In the previous article I posed the possibility of limitations to the growth of the iPhone, and even the possibility that at some point in time, sales might shrink. I met a lot of resistance here, with some insisting that growth will continue virtually forever (or so it seemed). Others agreed with me that we must recognize that sooner or later the market will cease to grow (beyond that of population growth). Even today, the overall growth of smartphone sales is not what it was a few years ago. The following chart shows projected global smartphone sales through 2019. [charts by the author, data from Statista ] The projection for world population in 2020 is 8 billion. The units figure given for 2019 would mean that one out of every four people on the planet will be buying a new smartphone. This sounds a bit high to me. In any case, note how future year-over-year growth is expected to be a fraction of that from 2009 through 2013. What this means is that market share becomes much more important. In the past, a rapidly expanding market meant you could lose share but still grow in numbers. Exactly what Apple has done. In the future, Apple will be able to grow sales of iPhones only by increasing market share. There will, of course, be a more or less stable basis of sales as people upgrade. (Apple can increase sales by inducing customers to upgrade more frequently, but there are limits to that.) The real problem with this situation, as noted in the earlier article, is how sensitive Apple earnings will then be to changes in market share. The iPhone represented 69% of revenue in December 2014 quarter. Any dip in popularity will be immediately felt on the top line and bottom lines. Additionally, a sales drop would not only bring down revenue, but since iPhone is currently the highest margin product line, it would knock margins as well. There are several reasons why the drop in iPhone sales is not likely, at least not in the foreseeable future. First, at the current time smartphone sales are still growing, particularly in China where the iPhone is doing very well. Bloomberg reported Sunday (26 April): Apple Inc.'s IPhone sales in China may have exceeded the U.S. for the first time in the latest quarter, thanks to brisk demand during the country's New Year celebrations. They note projections of 18 to 20 million units in China for the current quarter based on popularity of the larger 6 and 6 Plus models. Apple (arguably) has the best engineers, and most creative leaders in the tech industry. The legacy of Steve Jobs is not only the physical devices, but the company itself. CEO Tim Cook likes to say that innovation is in Apple's DNA. While some take such statements as mere PR, I believe there is a lot of truth in it. There is a never ending train of innovation from Apple in hardware, software and physical design. From front running processors that seem to do more with less energy, to leading photo capabilities built into the system, from best in class TouchID to groundbreaking ApplePay, the company leads in so many areas of innovation that they are guaranteed to keep the lead. It is important to understand that Apple does not sell just hardware, it sells a whole ecosystem. This means that customers soon become entrenched in the system and leaving it would involve significant effort. The iPhone continues to have highest customer satisfaction overall, and this extends through all of Apple's products. All this provides a tremendous moat around the iPhone, protecting it from any sudden defection. Apple would have to create a very seriously defective new iPhone model to see any serious level of abandonment. As for the fickle whims of fashion, the ecosystem moat would dampen that significantly. In theory it is a possible factor, but it is something that would take a very long time to play out. Additionally, for this to happen there would need to be an alternative that would so overshadow the iPhone as to cause such a change. This is something that Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) has been trying to do for years. In spite of some impressive hardware, however, they remain behind in the most significant technologies (64-bit processor, fingerprint recognition, security, ApplePay, HealthKit, handoff, etc.). The one thing that they, and other Android manufacturers, have led in is larger sized handsets. This, however, was easily overcome when Apple introduced the new 6 and 6 Plus models which pushed them to global #1 manufacturer last quarter, according to Gartner , with over 74 million units sold. The last area addressed in the previous article was a potential failure for the Apple Watch. I have discussed how the important thing for the sale of any product is perceived value . I questioned whether or not there would be long term perceived value in the Apple Watch. Right now millions of early adopters have snapped up all available units to a tune of most likely over 2 million units. But will this level of interest continue or will the device be viewed as a very well designed gadget that in the end has little real value? So when the dust settles, and a year or two has gone by, how will it be viewed? If Apple Watch were to eventually be a failure, then that would damage Apple's reputation in all areas, and would be very negative for share price. To me this is a tough one. You have real convenience designed into the notifications, updated Siri, maps, exercise apps, and so forth. Additionally the new Research Kit is something that will have profound affects on medical research (assuming the platform survives). The early success of this alone is extraordinary, and the watch will likely play an important role. Certainly, if any smartwatch will break into the mainstream it will be the Apple Watch. No other wearable on the planet has had such intense and dedicated design at every level of the product. So the jury is out on this one. Balanced with the risk, one would remember the potential benefits if the Apple Watch succeeds. This will provide an new, very high margin, revenue stream and entice new customers to the iOS product line. As noted above, this is a resultant of both iPhone and Apple Watch. I have addressed the iPhone issue above, and it is highly unlikely that there will be any significant dampeners on growth for the smartphone, aside from eventual slowdown in growth as the market approaches saturation. While the investor needs to keep growth in mind, I think that it should not be over done for two big reasons. Growth from Apple watch should it be successful Apple TV - the little set top box is still only half a step up from a hobby for Apple, but if rumored deals should come to fruition, then this would be a large source of new revenue. Currently it is thought that Apple gets a cut of HBO Now revenues. ApplePay - Revenue is not considered a main reason for this service, but it could turn into a real source if it catches on in a big way, particularly if Apple should expand into the financial services sector. New products - It is unlikely that we have seen the last of new products out of Cupertino. We may have to wait for several years, The second major reason is that growth is becoming less important to Apple. In earlier years, Apple was at the verge of extinction, and had very little working capital to play with. As first the iPod and then the iPhone turned Apple into the company it is today, capital has increased to an extraordinary level (currently $178 billion), and it is absurd to do anything but return a great deal to investors. In short, Apple has become a cash generating dividend company. This alone warrants the current, and even higher, share price, so growth can be seen as icing on the cake for some. There are always reasons to doubt any particular investment, and Apple is no exception. In fact, there are more than usual with Apple because there always seems to be people trying to tear Apple down for every inconsequential misstep - real or invented. I hope that my previous article has articulated some main ones that I see as areas of real concern. But concern does not mean inaction. Potential vulnerabilities are to recognized and assessed. The assessments should then direct one's course of action. Here I believe I have addressed these issues and for the most part put them aside for future review. To me, the future of Apple looks bright as we step into a new era of wearables and a resurgence of the iPhone with the new sizes. To my mind, to be scared off by potential vulnerabilities would be betting against Apple innovation. That has been a bad bet since 1997. It has remained a bad bet over the past few years as well. It will likely remain a bad bet into the future. Disclosure: The author is long AAPL. (More...)The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.
