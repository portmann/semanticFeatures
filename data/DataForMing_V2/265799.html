ETF Hub Dec 15 2015, 18:45 ET | About: The Boeing Company (BA) | By: Carl Surran , SA News Editor Boeing (NYSE: BA ) bounced 2.5% in today's trade after yesterday's moves to raise its dividend and boost its share buyback program, but Canaccord analysts say investor sentiment on the company is “ as polarized as we have ever seen .” Canaccord thinks the current narrow-body backlogs support the announced rate increases, and sees Boeing ultimately announcing a rate increase on the 737 to ~60/month; the firm continues to believe that better than expected execution on the 787 will be the primary positive catalyst for Boeing shares. But others believe the commercial aerospace cycle is close to rolling over, and Boeing and Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSF , OTCPK:EADSY ) have been overproducing for demand; also, the negative group thinks significant charges are still to come on the 787 and that rate cuts soon will be announced on the 777. Canaccord views the key factor for Boeing in 2016 as execution on the 787 and whether Boeing hits cash break-even on a unit basis for the 787, which it believes would be a "very positive catalyst" for the stock. raises interesting questions.  I've been medium long with the stock and many times wonder if i shouldn't cash in the chips before a big fall or long rut of mediocrity.  in your opinion how does boeing hold up against rate increase.   absent a crash... always possible, do you see the stock coming near $100 again, or are we talking more of sideways 135 to 150? I say with BA prediction that China and other emerging market needing more planes in next decade, we should be safe to hold onto the stock and collect the juicy dividend. if it does drop to $100, I will be loading up because they didn't cut rates during the great recession they will not now ETF Screener: Search and filter by asset class, strategy, theme, performance, yield, and much more ETF Performance: View ETF performance across key asset classes and investing themes
