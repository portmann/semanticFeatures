Snapchat passes Twitter in daily usage - Snapchat (Private:CHAT) | Seeking Alpha Jun  3 2016, 02:31 ET | About: Snapchat (CHAT) | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor Roughly 150M people use Snapchat (Private: CHAT ) each day, according to a Bloomberg report , making the messaging app more popular than Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ). The latter, which is estimated to have less than 140M active daily users, was once the largest social network after Facebook, but has since fell behind the company's other apps, including Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. Excellent, so let's value Snapchat with 140M users sending silly snaps including sexting messages worth 2X more than Twitter at $20B valuation. Who needs Twitter ! Elon Musk, Warren Buffett, and President Obama will soon shutdown their Twitter accounts because sending snaps that disappear in 15 seconds is a breakthrough replacement ! I think $20B+ valuation may not be enough to handle this. Maybe Salesforce & Bloomberg should stop advertising on Twitter and switch to Snapchat so they can target early talent (teenagers). Part of the reason for the difference in valuation is momentum of Snapchat. It is usually above Instagram and Facebook in the App Store. That's where this gets interesting. Today, Facebook feed is all non-original content sharing except for photos & videos, which in-turn is cannibalized by Instagram. Now, Snapchat also wants a piece of that. Thus Snapchat, FB, and Instagram are mass social network applications that are all fighting in the photo & video market. Twitter on the other hand is far from all of that. It is not even a mass social network. It's key differentiation factor is that it is the source of original content mostly live, in the form of text that is broadcasted to the public. I don't see Snapchat, Instagram or FB taking a share of that from Twitter anytime soon. P.S. I have no idea how Facebook gets away with double counting FB vs Instagram. Today Facebook's original content is limited to photos, just go check out your stream. Either FB wins or Instagram wins. Both cannot win. Instagram could be just a tab inside FB for photos. At least, I hope advertisers aren't dumb enough to pay twice for same set of eyes. Makes sense to me. Dont know one person who uses twitter regularly, however every person under 30 I know loves and uses snapchat all the time! I understand the appeal of Snapchat as I'm one of the people who use it everyday. However, the revenue per user can't approach other social media apps because Snapchat hasn't gathered any information about them.
