Ford Stock Forecast For 2016 - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha I Know First Research , Stock Forecast Based On a Predictive Algorithm (988 clicks) Ford will release all the details of their new contract with the United Auto Workers union today which will allow investors to more accurately predict the effects. The F-series has been the top selling vehicle in America for years and it remains on schedule to keep that title. Numerous models have undergone redesign, including the 2017 Ford GT, slated for availability in 2016. Details of Ford's ( F ) newly ratified labor contract with UAW should come out on Monday, November 30th, but many investors already have concerns with the details made public thus far. Affecting roughly 53,000 workers at 22 plants, the new agreement revamps the current pay schedule by gradually increasing pay over the next 8 years. It also includes new bonuses and a promise of $9 billion in plant investments over the next 4 years. Investors' apprehension lays in the anticipated impact of the wage increases on Ford's hourly labor and benefits costs. By 2019, this cost will most likely average $60 per hour, placing Ford on par with GM. GM and Chrysler also placed new contracts in effect this year. Comparatively, analysts expect Ford's hourly labor and benefit costs to rise 5.26%, whereas they expect GM's (NYSE: GM ) and Chrysler's rates to increase 9.09% and 19.15% respectively. The smaller increase will give Ford an edge in absorbing the new manufacturing costs. As of the end of October, sales of Ford's F-series for the year 2015 sat at 629,951, keeping it on track to hold its place as the number one vehicle in America. The 2016 F-150 has a few new features including back up assist which has a rear camera and a separate knob on the dash to help steer what the driver has hitched to the back. That 65% of consumers claim they would switch vehicle brands based on their desired features underlines the ever increasing importance of equipping vehicles with the latest technology. Ford has also increased its marketing expenditures to advertise the myriad new features. The new 2016 F-150 has also added a number of green truck awards to its lengthy list of accolades. These awards stem from the recycled content used in the trucks as well as the impressive 26 mpg highway. These moves towards greener products become more and more important as environmental issues and the triple bottom line settle in as important points of differentiation among companies, especially in a highly competitive market such as vehicles. Ford has redesigned more than just their F-series. Available in 2016, the following 2017 models also boast impressive new features and designs: Escape, Raptor, Super Duty, and Chassis cab. Their most exciting 2017 model, however, will surely be the GT. Named Automobile magazine's 2016 Design of the Year, Ford has big plans for this remarkable car. To commemorate the 50th anniversary of Ford's GT win at the world famous 24 Hours of Le Mans automobile endurance race, their GT will once again make an appearance at the race in June to show off its impressive new features. A complete list of the specs this six-figure luxury ride will boast (including the exact price) has yet to be announced, leaving many car aficionados salivating for the next performance or design detail leaked by Ford. With Ford defending its position as seller of the #1 vehicle in America as well as they hype surrounding the new GT, a 1 year target of 18 seems reasonable. This year, the stock has traded between 10.44 and 16.74, so the recommendation by 6 analysts of this stock as a strong buy, 1 as a buy, 6 as hold, and just 1 as sell seems to support this target. Ford has experienced steady revenue growth from quarter to quarter this year, a trend likely to continue through 2015's Q4. After a 34.29% earnings surprise in Q2 of 2015, the analysts reached a consensus EPS of 0.47. Furthermore, analysts expect yearly EPS to rise each year, with a 2016 consensus of 1.9 (up from 2015's consensus of 1.63) and some anticipating the stock growing as high as 2.33 in 2018. Current investors have experienced increased dividend payouts as Ford is on its way to reaching pre-recession highs. Despite lagging behind Chrysler's current yield of 6.71%, Ford's yield of 4.12% beats GM's and Honda's yields of 3.96% and 2.4% respectively. Ford's new contract with the United Auto Workers Union might cause concern for some, but the modest increase in costs coupled with the slow implementation will allow Ford to effectively absorb the cost without taking a huge toll on its bottom line. It appears that the F-series will hold on to its title as America's favorite vehicle and their exciting new product designs give many consumers reason to direct their business towards Ford. Additionally, Ford's reveal of their new GT at select auto shows has numerous car enthusiasts hyped up and eager to see when they will become available to the public. Analysts have reflected these positive new aspects of Ford in their forecasts and recommendations. Moreover, the I Know First algorithm is bullish on this stock in the long term, with a bullish algorithmic forecast to support the fundamental analysis of the Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F ) stock.
