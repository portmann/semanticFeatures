Does Gilead Have The Cure For Apple-Itis? - Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) | Seeking Alpha Gilead Sciences has experienced tremendous earnings growth with the success of their revolutionary hepatitis C drugs. While the stock has done well, it has not kept up with the pace of the earnings growth as investors question whether it can keep up this momentum. Like Apple was in early 2013, it is being priced as if a big revenue and earnings slowdown is assured at some point in the future. It remains to be seen whether, like Apple, Gilead can remain innovative enough to avoid this, but with promising HIV and cancer treatments in the pipeline I'm optimistic. Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ: GILD ) has been one of the market's great growth stories over the past several years. On the strength of their breakthrough hepatitis C drugs Harvoni and Sovaldi, the biotech company quadrupled annual earnings in a single year. And unlike smaller biotech startups, this was not exactly off a tiny base, but rather was from $3B in 2013 to $12B for 2014. This remarkable, perhaps unprecedented, earnings growth surprised even the most optimistic analysts and investors, including yours truly. Exactly a year ago, I posted this now embarrassing comment on an excellent article about Gilead: "If GILD can really grow earnings as much as analysts are projecting, it will approach the total earnings power of JNJ in a few years and would presumably eclipse its market cap if it trades at even a slight premium. I'm not sure they're taking into account how difficult it becomes to continue to grow revenues and earnings at such a torrid pace when the sheer size becomes so large." Wow, brilliant analysis on my part. Pass the crow and humble pie, please. Not only has Gilead gained 30% since then, it has actually "approached the total earnings power" of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ ) in just a single year, much less the "few years" I skeptically thought it would take to achieve, if indeed it ever did. The only thing I got right is that Gilead hasn't yet eclipsed Johnson & Johnson's market cap. If fact, it hasn't even come close, with a market cap currently at around $145B versus the $275B of JNJ. However, this isn't because earnings have come up short at "only" $12B versus the $16B JNJ pulled in last year. Rather, it's because Gilead shockingly now trades at a discount to JNJ, with trailing Price to Earnings ratios of 12 and 16.5, respectively. When you look at forward P/E ratios based on earnings estimates, the discrepancy becomes even greater, at 10 for GILD and 16 for JNJ , despite the fact that Gilead would have grown earnings at 18% versus 4% for JNJ. Furthermore, GILD is expected to continue to be able to grow earnings at a higher 13% rate for the next five years, versus only 6% for JNJ, putting its PEG at 0.9, less than one third of JNJ's ratio of 2.75. Nothing against Johnson & Johnson, one of the great American companies, but this is insane! And I don't mean to pick on JNJ specifically just because it was who I happened to mention in my initial comment, since other drug companies, especially biotechs, are trading at much higher levels. While Johnson & Johnson certainly deserves credit for their consistency and longevity, who's to say Gilead won't do the same for the next 20 years as JNJ did for the past 20? Rather, Gilead is being priced as if not only will their earnings growth not continue, it will fall off a cliff at some point in the future. I refer to this condition as Apple-itis. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) enjoyed such similar phenomenal success in the past that investors convinced themselves that it couldn't possibly continue for long. This manifested itself most acutely at the beginning of 2013, when investors panicked over a slight slowdown in revenue and earnings and drove the stock all the way from a (split-adjusted) high of $100 to under $60. I also noted Apple's mounting problems (sarcastically, in case you couldn't tell and still think I'm a total idiot from my earlier comment), but considered them either insignificant or temporary and rather than selling continued to buy. Apple validated my faith and has been not only one of the best performers in my portfolio, but also continues to be one of the best performing stocks of all time. The point of this is not to brag about my success, but rather illustrate a lesson I have had trouble learning that has often led to failure, or at least missed opportunity. When the stock of a great company like Apple, Disney (NYSE: DIS ), or Under Armour (NYSE: UA ) performed well, I had a tendency to think it had gotten away from me and never considered buying it again, no matter how attractive the future looked. This costly fault is expressed by a great quote from noted value investor Whitney Tilson, who has recently gained fame (or infamy, depending on your point of view) with his very public Lumber Liquidators (NYSE: LL ) short position. In 2013, he told the Value Investing Congress that the most expensive words in investing are " I missed it. " In my experience, this is absolutely true. In fact, way back when Apple first introduced the iPhone I was skeptical that they were too reliant on the one hit wonder iPod and didn't know anything about phones. Again, the company and the market did a great job of making me look like an idiot, but rather than saying "I missed it," I said another three words that are often the hardest to admit: "I was wrong." And while I seem to have made the same initial mistake with Gilead in underestimating its potential, I don't want to compound my error and never consider buying the stock again, since just because a stock has performed great in the past doesn't mean it can't perform great into the future. Rather, I aim to take what I learned in admitting my mistake and look to apply it to Gilead if it ever follows in Apple's briefly wobbly footsteps, since just because a company has a temporary slowdown doesn't mean it won't recover. As we saw with Apple, sometimes it's just an unwarranted drop in the stock price on unfounded concerns, and while this hasn't quite played out to the same extent with Gilead yet, the stock is showing similar signs of a pullback. Earnings estimates for future quarters and years are slowly coming down, with the stock price following from a high of almost 117 to under 100. While not quite the 40% decline Apple experienced back in 2013, it suggests investors might be losing faith and could be scared out of the stock by one more sub-par quarter. This would be shortsighted in my opinion, given Gilead's past performance and future potential. Momentum investors might leave Gilead to chase frothier biotechs, but value investors whom I greatly respect are stepping up to take their place and putting the stock into much stronger hands. This includes dividend growth investors like Tim McAleenan Jr. and Chowder even though Gilead doesn't currently pay a dividend, since they recognize the potential for an outsized one in the future based on more than $12B of free cash flow. I won't venture to make specific projections on the prospects for Gilead's current or future drugs, as it has already been done on this website better than I could hope to (notably here , here , and here ). Rather, I trust that such an innovative company will continue to build on their recent success, especially now that they have billions in cash flow that they can reinvest in R&D to build future franchises in promising areas like HIV treatment and cancer research. I hope that Gilead continues to come up with cures to these and other diseases and will look to join other savvy investors in owning a great company at a great price. I have learned from past mistakes as well as past successes not to pass up an immense opportunity just because the stock gets too high or too low, since it is the performance of the company that ultimately matters in the long run, and Gilead has more current achievements and future potential than almost any other company I can think of.
