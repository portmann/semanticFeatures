Why Amazon.com's Threat To Wal-Mart Is Worrying - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) | Seeking Alpha Wal-Mart's stock is cheap for a reason. Amazon.com's excessive valuation is not entirely irrational. Shares of Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) are barely recovering. The company lost nearly a third of its market value, due to a revenue miss in the third quarter. The retailer raised its earnings estimates slightly on November 17, but it still faces major headwinds. Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ) may make no profits, but its growth continues to put significant pressure on Wal-Mart. In the last five years, Amazon.com's revenue grew in the triple-digit rates, whereas Wal-Mart's revenue growth was flat. In the third quarter alone, Amazon's revenue grew 23 percent to $25.4 billion. It is worth noting that AWS - Amazon Web Services - accounted for only 8 percent of total revenue but 52 percent of operating profit. Wal-Mart continued its expansion by selling groceries. It offered grocery pickup, which Wal-Mart said on its conference call found success. Online customers spent 50 percent more, compared to those who shopped only in stores. Amazon is ramping up its efforts in offering grocery shopping. If its free same-day delivery and shipping for Amazon Prime customers is any indication, Wal-Mart will face significant pressure. For many food items, customers must order items online and then pick them up at a store. In many cases, neither shipping nor free pickup is available. Amazon's plans to deliver goods through drones is revolutionary. It may reshape the cost curve for the company, lowering costs and making it more efficient to fulfill orders having few items. Another problem with Wal-Mart entering the grocery market is that Costco (NASDAQ: COST ) becomes another competitor. Revenue growth for Costco greatly outpaced that of Wal-Mart in the last five years: Investors point to Amazon.com's P/E as a reason to avoid the firm. Looked another way, bullishness for Costco is higher than for Amazon.com, when looking at EV to EBITDA: As Amazon reaches new highs, bears are befuddled. Bulls are correctly anticipating the online retailer's dominance over bricks and mortar firms will continue growing. Even side projects like the online discount warehouse show that Amazon will find creative ways to sustain its revenue growth.
