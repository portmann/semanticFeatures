Shares of Spirit are depressed due to the ongoing master agreement negotiations with Boeing where the interim contract expired last week. We think Spirit is in a better negotiating position than the market is embedding into the price due to their already lower cost infrastructure, quality, and delivery times. The macro headwinds are also likely overblown given the truly massive backlog at the OEMs and the growth in air travel globally due to rising income levels. Spirit Aerosystems (NYSE: SPR ) is one of the largest aircraft parts designers and manufacturers in the world. They were formerly a part of Boeing as their aerostructures business, which was acquired by a private equity group back in 2005. Spirit then went public in 2006 and almost immediately acquired the BAE System aerostructures business the same year, which helped to diversify them into the Airbus ecosystem. We think the shares are on sale due to the lack of a new Boeing Master Services Agreement which expired at the end of 2015. The negotiations are ongoing and are a result of both major OEMs attempting to drive out costs. As the top line is one of the most visible revenue streams with a backlog of $46 billion through 2020 on more than 12K orders for large commercial planes, we think the business is lower risk than what the market currently assesses. Spirit Aerosystems is one of the largest suppliers on Boeing's 787 Dreamliner program as they are continuing their talks on a new deal that would raise its procurement costs on the jet, but potentially yield much larger savings on other planes under development. These negotiations have been ongoing for more than two years now and we are approaching the wire as the current extended contract expired a few weeks ago. We believe this is the main reason for the shares backing off as no new deal has since been announced. Boeing has been pressing their suppliers to cut costs in return for more work or for more favorable terms. Spirit noted an interim deal was reached in May which helped to shelve earlier planned price cuts and charge more for the parts it makes for the two 787 models currently in production. The filing detailed that the company would record the incremental revenue from the high cost of 787 parts as deferred revenue, which it would only collect if a new final agreement was reached with Boeing. Given the lack of a new deal by year end, Spirit will have to give up those incremental earnings. Boeing would like to reduce the costs of their larger jets as the market moves towards smaller, longer-range aircraft due to airlines wanting to reduce the hub-and-spoke operating system. Spirit makes a large amount of the parts for Boeing's best selling aircraft, the 737 model. Spirit currently supplies engine mounting and complete fuselage of Boeing's 737 making it integral into Boeing's business model. Given the lack of demand for Boeing's widebody jets coupled with the increased demand for their 737 aircraft, we think a new deal is more probable than not, even if it comes after the expiration deadline. The partnering for success platform flows both ways and we think both are attempting to lever the other. But despite 83% of revenue to Spirit coming from Boeing, we actually think Boeing is in the more precarious position given their sensitivity to order delays and costs which could mean billions of dollars in disruption should an agreement not be reached. We believe ultimately that the company and Boeing will reach an agreement in several smaller pieces rather than all at once. Obviously, the potential impact from the companies not reaching a new contract would be devastating. But we think that devastation helps to insulate the downside because a new contract must be reached. We think the market is pricing in too much risk and that a deal will be reached. Procurement Savings And Supply Chain Improvements Spirit currently spends approximately $4.5 billion on parts and services outside of their company. Over the last two years, the company has been attempting to drive out cost by bringing some production in-house as well as consolidating/aggregating vendors. Cost reduction programs center around the make and buy decision as well as new equipment to drive productivity with the benefit of these actions accruing over time. By working on the supply chain in this effort, mainly by consolidation, they can take out direct cost while improving quality and overall productivity. Management has noted that they have over 1,000 suppliers but just 100 account for over 90% of their parts and material supplies. We think they will continue to drive down the number of suppliers by a significant level, maybe by as much as 80% over the next few years in order to reduce costs and delivery times. Management is behind on this movement with just about 50% of the strategy being implemented. They expect to have much of the infrastructure in place by the end of this year. In addition to reducing the number of suppliers, they are bringing some production in-house- for example their 787 wheel well box. In conjunction with this, they are moving some production to lower-cost locales. Management made note to say that they would only do so where quality controls could be met so as to not disrupt production or delivery times. Overall, the company is likely to save approximately $100 million in incremental savings, or about 2.2% of their total supply chain and procurement spend this year. And then we think another $50 million could be realized over the subsequent several years. Management has seen the cost-focused strategy working and margins have expanded followed by strong cash flow generation. Some of the savings have come from paying to dispose of programs that were not cost effective. Current State of the Commercial Aerospace Market In addition to the overhang due to the contract negotiations, we think the shares are down by ~10% since early August due to the macro concerns globally. But the current market has never been as strong with over 12K orders in backlog split fairly evenly between Boeing and Airbus and also split between replacement aircraft and expansion. The largest number of aircraft in the backlog is the 737 model, which is Spirit's largest program at ~4,200 orders across all 737 models. This amount of order backlog represents over 7 years of revenue giving the company a large amount of visibility into revenue generation. We also think the reauthorization of the Export-Import bank , which provides subsidized guarantees for foreign purchases of domestically produced aircraft, is not likely to have much effect on the company. For one, the five member board still only has two confirmed members, and thus lacks the quorum necessary to conduct business. We do not think it matters though as most Export-Import guarantees required over the next two years had been authorized already before the previous charter expired. Even if the affected countries (oil-producers, Russia, China, Brazil) seeing the potential for marked slowdown in their economies were to cancel all of their orders, research indicates that there would still be at least 5 years of backlog. And the likelihood of these countries canceling all of their orders is miniscule, in our opinion. Thus, we think macro concerns are likely overblown given the strong amount of orders for new passenger jets. We think the valuation is currently depressed by the Boeing negotiations and the macro risks. But we think the amount of strength in the OEM production and global air passenger industry is not likely to slow despite any substantial slowdown in their economies. Much of the oil-related macro slowdowns is likely to be more than offset by the benefit to the airlines, with lower oil costs reducing fares and promoting demand and increased capex spend for new planes. We think the shares are worth approximately $65 based on the following growth drivers and operating metrics. First, while 2016 revenues are likely to be relatively flat, fuselage and propulsion systems growth should be strong, offset by a decline in wing systems. Operating margins should see some upside from their cost savings of approximately $100 million during the year, driving the margins up by 20-30 bps. The company should earn $4.15 this year and $4.60 in fiscal 2017. The current multiple is approximately 13x but we think that will get re-rated higher when a new contract comes out, simply due to the industry strength and very clear visibility in their revenue stream. At 15x those earnings, we have an intrinsic value of $62.25 and a one-year price target of $69, which we averaged to our current warranted value of $65, or upside of 38%. Spirit Aerosystems continues to be held back by the Boeing contract uncertainties. Despite this, we think Spirit is in a strong negotiating position, stronger than the market currently applies to the shares. We believe that the shares will pop once a deal or at least a small piece of a larger deal is announced. In the interim, we think the lower cost infrastructure is starting to materialize and an eventual deal with both Boeing and subsequently Airbus will be a key source of upside in free cash flow generation. We are bullish on the potential for additional cost savings on procurement and supply chain improvements driving free cash flow and the valuation, once the overhangs are removed.
