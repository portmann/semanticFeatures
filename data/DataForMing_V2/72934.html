ETF Hub Jun  1 2015, 12:34 ET | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Disney's ( DIS +1.1%) CFO, Jay Rasulo, is stepping down on June 30, the company says. The company hasn't mentioned a replacement and says it will name a new CFO at a later date, though the move likely removes a competitor -- and clears a path -- for Tom Staggs to eventually succeed Bob Iger as CEO. Rasulo will continue to serve as adviser to the company and help with transition to a new exec in the role. "Jay has been a valued colleague and friend, as well as a vital contributor to Disney's success, particularly in his roles as chief financial officer and chairman of our Parks and Resorts division," says Iger.
