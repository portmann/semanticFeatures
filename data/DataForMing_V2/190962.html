Is Disney's Debt A Problem? - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha A recent debt issuance in September and an aggressive stock buyback have investors on alert amid a stock down considerably from 52-week lows. Disney has a large amount of outstanding debt, but has the cash flow to cover it. There's concerns that the recent debt issuance could pose a risk to their dividend, but I believe the dividend is safe and that it has room to grow comfortably. Most concerns revolving around Disney (NYSE: DIS ) revolve around the efficacy of subscriber growth for ESPN and expectations for Star Wars at the box office and in merchandise. However, with the recent $2 billion debt issuance, LT debt has risen considerably and presents an added concern given their recent share price downtrend. The question is - is it that bad? I'd argue know and that they're in an incredibly stable position moving forward. Disney's YTD chart is disappointing as of late. They started the year incredibly strong, providing great returns to shareholders, but the August and September global vol took them for a large dip. Unfortunately, I got in at the $109 level before fear really took over the stock, causing it now to trade below its 50 and 200 MDA. The company currently has $15.27 billion in LT debt (bonds and notes), but let's take a closer look. Some notable metrics to consider: Disney is just a tad higher on the P/E versus the industry average of 20.36, but is very stable on the debt to EBITDA. The comparison to assets and cap are also both notably low, which shows the company's good command over their current structure. The industry average for debt to equity is also notably higher at 39.46, allowing Disney to continue to comfortably. Cash flows from financing was also notably lower the past few quarters thanks to a recurrent stock buyback. Disney has been making moves since the August dip started to really set in, as management has spent $2.6 billion on buybacks to get in at great, lower prices. On the year, the company has bought back $5.6 billion and is authorized to purchase up to $8 billion in 2016. After changes in working capital in Q4 2014 proved to be highly negative, the company hit a five quarter OCF low of $1.8 billion. Since then, the company has recovered to place OCF at $2.81 billion. Panning out, the company has increased OCF considerably over the past five years, up to $9.78 billion in 2014 versus a 2010 level of $6.58 billion. While FCF was lower in 2014 versus 2013 by $190 million, the current Q2 2015 FCF level is $1.65 billion, and while this trails Q1 at $2.01 billion, the company is still remains exceptionally liquid. What's particularly great about this aggressiveness in the buyback is that Disney is setting a limit on how far their stock can dip. I believe we've seen the bottom on this stock for quite some time and that entry points are attractive at current levels. With an analysis of cash flow comes the consideration of how sustainable the company's dividend is and what the growth rate for it will look like moving forward. Think about their dividend growth from a historical perspective. After the financial crisis, this company went in overdrive to increase its yield and provided consistent returns to shareholders. The company announced the 1H 2015 dividend payout back in June and spent roughly $1.02 billion dividends, which was more than covered by current cash flow. I don't think the dividend is in jeopardy at all giving that comparison. The current yield of 1.29% lags behind the S&P average yield, which means that this company knows it needs to increase. Considering the payout ratio is low at 37%, meaning the company has room to grow the dividend. CEO Iger has promised that it will grow 15% on an annual basis, which is excellent for dividend investors. Disney is the blue-chip equity that you keep in your portfolio to provide a consistent annual return. You know this, I know this, and we count on it. That being said, of course we can have concerns about performance, but please note that this company isn't going to default on its debt any time soon. Fitch gives them an A rating, and Moody's gave the recent bond offering an A2. 2.15% notes due 2020 worth $750 million These notes are fixed-rate and aren't susceptible to any impact from a potential Fed rate hike, just as a disclosure. As for some closer maturities , Disney has: 1.35% notes due August 2016 for $750 million 5.625% notes due September 2016 for $750 million 1.125% notes due February 2017 for $1 billion It's worth noting that this is a significant amount of debt being taken on, especially given its September issuance amid the strong stock buyback and global volatility. To me, it seems that Disney is doing everything it can on a financial front to secure itself against further losses. Disney is a stock that has provided double-digit returns for over a decade. While debt is just one factor to look at, we know that the other risks for Disney are subscriber losses, operating costs for ESPN, network ratings, theme park attendance levels and expenditures per person, as well as their movie pipeline (however, that latter risk is more of a reward considering their five year pipeline that was just unveiled). I'm keeping my long call on Disney as I believe this is a stock you have to ride out. I'd expect this stock to be passing the $120 level by end of Q4.
