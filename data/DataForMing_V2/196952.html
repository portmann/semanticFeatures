Should Intel Worry About IBM's Launch Of Linux Servers? - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Some industry watchers believe Intel’s server chip business could take a hit with the launch of IBM’s Linux servers. IBM claims its new servers are capable of completing average workloads at less than half the cost and more than twice the speed of an Intel Xeon-based server. Intel’s upcoming Broadwell-based Xeon processors, which will be released in the first quarter of 2016, will present tough challenge to IBM’s new servers. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) is the market leader in the server chip business with its Xeon line of servers. In an effort to take the server chip business away from Intel, IBM (NYSE: IBM ) has launched its new Power processor-based Linux servers, which are faster and cheaper than a similarly configured x86-based server powered by Intel's Xeon E5 processor, IBM claims. IBM's internal testing showed that its new Power Systems LC line of servers are capable of completing an average Apache Spark workload at less than half the cost of an x86-based Intel Xeon E5-2699 powered server. IBM claims the LC line of servers can provide customers 2.3 times better performance per dollar spent, compared to the x86-based Xeon powered servers. Embracing an open model of innovation has enabled us to build systems that help translate mountains of data into actionable business insight. By collaborating with partners from the OpenPower Foundation, our new line of servers provides clients with the performance they need to analyze and act on their data in real time. With IBM's server business declining continuously, the launch of its new line of servers is a desperate move to retain market share. IBM is targeting the enterprises and the HPC (high performance computing) segment with its new line of servers. In the first quarter of 2015, worldwide server market grew 17.2% year-over-year in terms of revenues, while IBM's server revenues plunged 18.7%, according to IDC . It said, "IBM retained its number 3 position following its x86 divestiture with $1.7 billion in revenue and 13.2% market share. IBM's revenues are now associated with its Power and mainframe product lines." IBM's market share fell to 13.2% from 19% in the year-ago quarter. IDC further said that in the first quarter worldwide volume server revenue increased 13.6% to $9.7 billion driven by continued expansion of x86-based hyperscale server infrastructures. As long as this trend continues, Intel has nothing to worry about. In case of volume servers, each server is assigned one role. In case of lower volume or midrange servers, each server is assigned multiple roles. In the midrange segment, revenue increased 7.2% to $1 billion. The midrange segment is dominated by the Intel x86 processors. IBM has no role here. However, the situation is changing in the volume server segment where IBM Power processors used to dominate the market earlier. While IBM still enjoys leadership position in the non-x86 segments with its mainframe and Power processors, the situation is worsening with intensifying competition from x86-based servers in the Power segment. The mainframe segment saw a year-over-year revenue increase of 44.7% to $2.1 billion in the first quarter, driven by IBM's z13 refresh. However, the Power segment is lagging far behind. I don't believe IBM's new Power Systems LC line could be a potential threat to Intel's server chip business. While choosing between Intel x86 and Power, virtualization makes the real difference. The demand for x86-based virtual servers is rising rapidly due to their increased efficiency with various Linux-based hypervisors, such as VMware's (NYSE: VMW ) ESXi or Red Hat's (NYSE: RHT ) KVM. With the increasing popularity of hyperscale OpenStack clouds in software-defined data center (SDDC), I strongly believe the demand for Intel's Xeon line of processors will continue to rise. I have discussed the future potential of virtualization on x86 hardware in greater detail in a previous article . Intel will release two Broadwell-based Xeon E5 processors, Xeon E5-1600 v4 and E5-2600 v4, in the first quarter of 2016. IBM's newly launched Linux servers will face tremendous competition from Intel's upcoming Xeon processors. In a previous article I shared how Intel's product differentiation strategy will help the company retain market share amid a challenging and competitive business environment. I believe Intel is a superb long-term investment idea. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
