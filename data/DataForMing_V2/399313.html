The Beijing Municipal High Peopleâ€™s Court ruled in favor of Beijing Xingtong Tiandi Technology Co., which makes wallets, handbags, smartphone cases, and a plethora of other leather goods emblazoned with the word IPHONE, reports The Wall Street Journal . The ruling upheld previous decisions in the ongoing legal saga between Apple and Xingtong. The courtâ€™s verdict found Apple failed to prove that the brand â€œiPhoneâ€? was famous in China before Xingtong applied for its trademark in 2007. Though Apple first registered its iPhone trademark for computer-related products in China in 2002, according to state-run Legal Daily , those registrations only apply to specific categories of goods. When Apple registered iPhone, it didn’t register the name for leather goods. Apple didnâ€™t begin selling iPhones inside China until 2009 the accessories maker argued, and again, no one could get the two confused because Apple doesn’t sell purses. Although no mobile devices besides Appleâ€™s can be called iPhones, the ruling stymies the tech companyâ€™s quest to wholly own the name, at least, for now. â€œApple is disappointed the Beijing Higher Peopleâ€™s Court chose to allow Xintong to use the IPHONE mark for leather goods when we have prevailed in several other cases against Xintong,â€? Apple said in a statement Wednesday. â€œWe intend to request a retrial with the Supreme Peopleâ€™s Court and will continue to vigorously protect our trademark rights.â€?
