Facebook backs off from its bid to stream NFL games, Verizon, Yahoo and Amazon still contenders - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Apr  2 2016, 16:00 ET | About: Facebook (FB) | By: SA Eli Hoffmann , SA News Editor A month ago, Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) confirmed its interest in live-streaming the National Football League next season. Now it has withdrawn from the bidding, sources say . The key sticking point: Facebook wants its live videos to be commercial-free, and balked at the NFL’s traditional advertising model. The NFL commands a high price for live streaming: in the most recent deal, CBS and NBC each paid about $45M/game for five Thursday night games during the 2016 and 2017 seasons. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is reportedly obsessed with making Facebook's live-video service a success. The NFL continues to shop digital rights to its Thursday night games. Contenders include: Verizon (NYSE: VZ ), Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ).
