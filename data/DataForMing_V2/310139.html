What's the history of investing in extremely large tech companies at value prices? Not good. IBM (NYSE: IBM ), HP (NYSE: HPQ ), Dell and others did extremely poorly when they got very big, even when they appeared to be cheap. When technology companies trade at a big discounts, it is normally because earnings are about to fall off the cliff and the market has efficiently adjusted. History of investing in the largest company in the world does not inspire confidence either. This is typically followed by mean reversion. In the case of Apple, it is basically a consumer electronics product company, not a technology company. Over half of revenue is from iPhones; revenue numbers probably understate the case since a lot of service revenue is from the iPhone too. The all in price they charge for iPhones has held steady at about $700 since 2011. Over that time, Android has dropped from $400 to $200. Apple cannot hold its price level much longer. The history of consumer electronics is consistent with big price cuts. As that price comes down, Apple revenue, profit margins, and profit are likely to drop. When you buy at a low multiple, you know what price you are paying. The question is if the earnings will hold up. As iPhone price goes so will the company. A lot of people argue that Apple can buy anything they want since they have $150 billion in cash. They could buy Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) or Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ). However, neither acquisition would necessarily create value at the price that Apple would have to pay. Neither would solve the problem of a risky consumer electronics company with undiversified and precarious earnings growth.
