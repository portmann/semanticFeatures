Verizon: Best Value In Years - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha Verizon completes the AOL merger that distracted investors on the valuation of the stock. The domestic pricing wars are starting to lose steam. With the closing of the AOL (NYSE: AOL ) deal, Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ ) can now move forward. While AT&T (NYSE: T ) is surging to new highs building off the April surge in the stock, Verizon is down after going forward with AOL. Part of this is due to some excitement building for the DirecTV (NASDAQ: DTV ) merger, but the market appears to be overlooking Verizon now. Before AOL came along, Verizon was showing some potential for a breakout. The stock remains stuck in a tight range for a couple of years now due to an over priced stock when the pricing wars were initiated in the domestic wireless market by both Sprint (NYSE: S ) and T-Mobile (NYSE: TMUS ). The news overshadowed by a focus on AOL is that Sprint continues to make more noise about focusing on improved networks over an all out pricing war. As highlighted in Is Verizon Finally Set For A Breakout? , the basis of the expected stock move was the failure of Sprint to disrupt the domestic wireless market via a pricing war. The end result was weaker results for Sprint and a period of less than expected numbers for Verizon. The later continues to grow earnings while Sprint struggles with mounting losses. The latest news from Sprint is an apparent shift towards focusing on building a better network to compete on quality versus price. CEO Marcelo Claure recently suggested that unlimited data plans might cease to exist or the wireless provider might look to raise prices. At the same time, the news flow suggests that Softbank's Son is pushing more into taking control of the network development plans. The moves have apparently forced out the CTO in July. FierceWireless documents other executive departures after Softbank executive Junichi Miyakawa took over as Technical COO. Whether Sprint is actively getting out of the pricing war efforts isn't 100% clear, but the news clearly shows a shift in focus toward the network over prices. The shift was necessitated due to the inability to add lucrative postpaid subscribers hooked on the Verizon and AT&T networks. The new CEO made the big mistake from the beginning of his tenure that consumers wanted cheaper prices over quality service. All Sprint ended up adding were the low-quality prepaid subscribers that do place a priority on price. Wireless providers though don't build expensive 4G networks for those subscribers. If Sprint is truly knocking off the pricing wars or it just isn't going to resonate with the market, Verizon becomes a very compelling investment now. Finalizing the AOL deal gets that distraction out of the way. Investors can now move forward with a focus on the opportunity provided by Verizon. The AOL news is interesting in the desire to build a mobile media platform. Regardless of whether one sees it as working, AOL only had revenue of $2.6 billion versus the over $130 billion of Verizon. It almost isn't material enough to grab any real attention from the investor community. If one buys Verizon today, its almost a small option that could boost the shares if it works. The key to the investment is that the stock continues to get cheaper by the minute. The stock continues trading down despite generating earnings growth in the face of the Sprint pricing wars. The forward PE ratio is now sub 12 after trading at substantially higher levels in the past couple of years. Another reason the stock is now a better value is that the Q1'15 earnings report substantially exceeded analyst estimates. With analysts increasing EPS estimates, Verizon is only getting cheaper with the stock declining in face of the good news environment. After a flat stock for a couple of years along with growing earnings estimates, Verizon Communications is now the cheapest it has traded at in years. With Sprint failing in its attempt to disrupt the domestic wireless market, Verizon is a solid buy at the current price.
