Best Buy: Benefiting From Growing Collaboration With Apple - Best Buy Co. (NYSE:BBY) | Seeking Alpha Best Buy delivered strong second-quarter financial results, which beat EPS expectations by a big margin. The company showed significant earnings per share surprise in all its last eight quarters. Best Buy's domestic comparable sales were up 3.8% in the second quarter, while the industry's comparable sales were down 1.9% in the same period. Best Buy will benefit from its increasing collaboration with Apple, and it has been working with Apple to update the 740 stores-within-a-store that were first implemented in 2007. The average target price of the top analysts is at $39.25, up 9.6% from the stock's August 27 close price. However, in my opinion, shares could go even higher. On August 25, Best Buy Co. (NYSE: BBY ) reported strong second-quarter fiscal 2016 financial results, which beat EPS expectations by a big margin of $0.15 (44.1%). The company posted revenue of $8.53 billion in the period, also surpassing Street forecasts. Analysts expected revenue of $8.3 billion. Best Buy showed significant earnings per share surprise in all its last eight quarters, as shown in the table below. Best Buy's domestic comparable sales were up 3.8% in the second quarter, compared to an increase of 2.0% in the previous quarter. Last quarter was the fourth quarter in a row of positive domestic comparable sales. These results are quite impressive, as the industry's comparable sales were down 1.9% in the quarter, which means that Best Buy has continued to gain market share. Also, back to school was off to a positive start, which is a good sign for the holidays. According to Hubert Joly, Best Buy's chairman and CEO, these better-than-expected second-quarter results are an affirmation that BBY's strategy of offering advice, service and convenience at competitive prices is paying off. Best Buy has been taking action to improve service and reduce costs in an attempt to compete profitably with Internet retailers as the consumer electronics category migrates online. The company's online comparable sales increased 17.0% in the second quarter, as BBY's investments in new capabilities continued to drive increased traffic and higher conversion rates. In a conference call with analysts, CEO Hubert Joly said: Our first observation is that overall consumer demand for technology products and services, including appliances and mobile phones, is growing. This growth is driven by technology and product innovation and by micro factors such as population growth, the housing recovery and healthy living trends that are driving momentum in our appliance, home theater, connected homes and health and wearables business, which, we believe, will remain positive catalyst in quarters to come. Moreover, Mr. Joly has been enthusiastic about Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) products. He claimed that demand for Apple Watch has been very strong in Apple stores-within-a-store and online. As a result, Best Buy will be carrying Apple Watch in more than 900 of its big-box stores beginning September 4. Apple Watch will be available in all 1,050 of its big-box stores and approximately 30 of its Best Buy Mobile Stores by the end of September. Best Buy has also been working with Apple to update the 740 stores-within-a-store that were first implemented in 2007. The stores-within-a-store will have new Apple fixtures and are larger with more display tables for phones, computers and tablets. The company has already implemented approximately 350 of them and expects to upgrade a total of approximately 520 by the holiday. The additional display tables are great for the merchandising of Apple Watch, which went on sale on BestBuy.com and in more than 100 of its stores in August. Best Buy will also begin selling AppleCare later this quarter, and additionally, it will proceed to roll out its capabilities as an Apple-authorized service provider first with in-store pilots in 50 locations by the holiday. The affirmation by Best Buy that demand for Apple Watch has been very strong should also encourage Apple's investors. Apple has not delivered sales results for the watch, which has caused speculation that Apple Watch sales have been lackluster.
