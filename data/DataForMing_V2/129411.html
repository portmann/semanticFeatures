Apple’s New Product Intro Pattern | The Big Picture “Analystsâ€™ estimates vary wildly, withÂ  manyÂ  originally predicting Â that Apple sold three million to five million watches from April to the end of June. After studying Appleâ€™s opaque earnings report, several analysts revised their estimates down to about 1.5 million to three million watches. Even at the lower end, thatâ€™s the opposite of instant death: Luca Maestri, Appleâ€™s chief financial officer, pointedly said the watch sold more in its first nine weeks on the market than either the iPhone Â or theÂ  iPad Â did in that same period. Yet the future of the Apple Watch will not be determined by first-quarter sales. Appleâ€™s product debuts tend to follow a well-worn script: A first-generation device is always criticized as overpriced and a bit lacking in utility and is often vulnerable to the charge that it is a solution in search of a problem. Then, over a few years, Apple and its customers figure out the best uses for the gadget, and the company methodically improves design and functionality to meet those needs. It also tends to lower its prices. Correspondingly, sales explode.” We don’t know if the Apple watch is another iPhone — indeed, by design its not supposed to be — Â but the early negativity surrounding the roll out is consistent with what we have seen with every other Apple intro the past decade.

Be sure to create straw men and argue against things I have neither said nor implied. If you could repeat previously discredited memes or steer the conversation into irrelevant, off topic discussions, it would be appreciated. Lastly, kindly forgo all civility in your discourse . . . you are, after all, anonymous. What if…Apple had taken a sightly different approach for the Watch and enclosed a cellular radio to make the device the “hub” of your Apple ecosystem?  Think of the possibilities, you now can choose to link your iPad, iPod, Mac Book Air, et al. to your wrist device and choose to talk/text/email/communicate from any or all of them.  OR, if I didn’t want to carry any device, a small Bluetooth headset is all I would need to initiate a voice call.  Instead, we have an add-on device that still requires me to carry an additional device to actually speak to anyone.  With the resurgence of power players carrying a simple flip-phone, it seems to me that demand exists for a simplification of communication, and isn’t Apple the master of this “simple is better” movement?
