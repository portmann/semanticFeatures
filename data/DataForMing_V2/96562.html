Facebook's New Plans For Ad Formats Showcase Product Pages And Video - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Businesses can create fully-branded, interactive destinations. Facebook users can look at video and photos as well as rotate products in 3D to explore features. Users can find the products they are looking for without leaving Facebook, keeping user log-in time up. Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) is using the backdrop of Cannes, the city famous for its international film festival, to showcase new ways it can shine for advertisers. At the Cannes Lions advertising festival , Facebook Chief Product Officer Christopher Cox announced potential features and changes to the ways businesses and advertisers can make their product and business space on Facebook. The company plans to take the convergence of increasing mobile usage and expanding online video capabilities to win the advertising dollars of businesses. With ad revenue the biggest driver of Facebook's business, the company not only has to safeguard its source of income but move ahead to where the clear majority of Facebook users are using the social media platform through smartphones and tablets. In a previous interview , CPO Cox said," You're starting to see a lot of new interactions (on mobile)… We're trying to spend a moment looking at some of these trends and imagining what they'll look like in next few years… We're trying to give marketers a canvas that's more engaging." The exact changes are still being worked on, but CPO Cox's presentation at the festival gave more insight in the elements that will be part of those changes. Businesses and advertisers will be able to set up an interactive and fully-branded page in the style they choose. These clients want to be in control of every little detail when it concerns their brand and products. Videos can be mixed with music and photos. The mock-up page video played at the advertising festival with CPO Cox's speech showed how users can flip through photos, rotate items in 3D, scroll through accessories and even give directions to stores. Similar to Facebook's Instant Articles news, which was unveiled in May , by having original content located first on the Facebook site, users can search for the products and businesses they are looking for without leaving Facebook. Also, once at the business page, the company links don't have to direct the user outside of Facebook to that company's website since product viewing and purchasing can all be done on Facebook. 1) Facebook can attract more advertising spending from vendors who see this as adding extra marketing value and product exposure 2) Build up internet search content within the Facebook platform so that users don't inadvertently leave Facebook and shorten their time on Facebook. 3) Create new ways to place ads and "buy buttons" into the content viewers are actively searching for. Facebook now has many more user videos uploaded onto its site rather than embedded links from other sources like YouTube. Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) has had years to develop features within videos that can drive online advertising and purchases. UK-based media search and data analytics company Ampere Analysis contends Facebook has to make itself more flexible in the way advertisers want to build brand awareness and control how the ad messages are presented and viewed. Also, it has to be cost effective. Ampere Analysis research director Richard Broughton said, "If the social network's own video ambitions are to be realized, and if it is to convince content owners it is a viable alternative to YouTube, it must deliver comparable returns." One way Facebook is making the returns better for content providers and advertisers is to split ad revenue with them. For example, Facebook made a deal with the NFL to show clips of football game highlights last December. In exchange, the NFL will get part of the revenues from ads that follow each clip. Those kinds of revenue streams can be expanded for businesses, ad campaigns and special events. What's the value proposition for Facebook investors? For one, Facebook is recreating the way ads are displayed to make them more relevant and personalized to users. The internet will become the dominant media avenue for advertising and surpass TV in 12 key markets , according to media-buying firm ZenithOptimedia industry research. Facebook's US monthly active users (MAU) generate the biggest average ad revenues out of the other world markets, but growth in the number of MAUs is slowing down. At the same time, more users are viewing Facebook through mobile devices, which are harder to advertise on because of the limited screen space. Facebook potentially can increase the ad revenue volumes by increasing the time users spend logged in on Facebook. Videos and original content news keep users engaged and provide a platform for more online purchases. Over the past year, Facebook shares are up 10.9% to $87.88 and are currently trading at 41 times fiscal 2016 forecast earnings. Piper Jaffray raised its Facebook price target to $120, up from the previous $92. That would be equal to a 36.5% share price gain if correct. Fiscal 2017 consensus forecast earnings growth is for 53%, so Facebook's valuation is looking attractive if it can deliver such growth. I think owning Facebook shares as the company expands as both a social media leader and advertising media dynamo is good.
