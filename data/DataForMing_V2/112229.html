ETF Hub Jul  9 2015, 16:35 ET | About: Apple Inc. (AAPL) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor After trading higher this morning, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) sold off on strong volume in afternoon trading. 77.7M shares changed hands today, topping a 3-month daily average of 45.1M. The Nasdaq rose 0.3%. Chinese macro fears fueled by the country's stock market crash are receiving plenty of ink. FBR's Daniel Ives: “China is poised to be Apple's high-octane fuel for the next few years, especially for iPhones ... Given a lot of the dark clouds we are seeing in China, that has spooked investors.” Chinese stocks rose overnight after fresh attempts by regulators to halt the plunge In an intraday note , Goldman cited Chinese worries as one of four potential factors weighing on shares, along with reports of soft Watch demand, a buyback blackout period, and sales by hedge funds and mutual funds. UBS, meanwhile, issued a note (.pdf) stating checks point to strong FQ3 (calendar Q2) Chinese iPhone sales. The firm admitted "a slowing Chinese economy is a risk," but downplayed fears a market crash will have a big macro impact, given equities account for only 20% of household wealth (12%-13% if one counts property). Thanks partly to pent-up demand for larger iPhones, Apple's Greater China revenue rose 71% Y/Y in FQ2 to $16.8B (29% of total revenue). FQ3 results arrive on July 21. Shares currently go for 12.3x an FY16 (ends Sep. '16) EPS consensus of $9.73. Which kind of bugs me, as his articles always seemed to come out at the absolute low end of any negative streak; a positive bounce always happened within 24 hours of a MB negative article. companies have a window during which buybacks is forbidden. I guess about 2 or 3 weeks before earnings and 48 hours after Quarterly release. Blackout helps me add to without competing with Tim Cook. To wmimis there is a buying blackout around earnings every quarter. Not sure how Mann days leading up to earnings and day of. Smart money should be buying AAPl hand over fist now. In fact sell everything else and just own AAPL.  120 is a steal.  And these "concerns" are either wildly overblown, simply untrue or fears that would affect 75% of stocks in the market if they come to fruition. Chinese consumers are not going to stop buying Apple products.  Sales in China has been accelerating not slowing. And even if they start to slow, they would be slowing from a 35%+ growth rate, or a 100%+ growth rate in places like Latin America.  Apple also just passed 50% of market share in the USA, a first. Concern about watch sales is ridiculous. Apple has already blown away Fitbit revenues just in the first week of watch sales, and slow sales since then have been due to two factors, supply constraint and now the knowledge that very soon a 2nd version of the watch will include many new features including decoupling from the iPhone, so it becomes a standalone device. SO naturally people are waiting a few months for that.   JP Morgan projects 26+ million sold by end of year and 30+ million sold by 12 months after release.  That means about 9 billion in profit per year, none of which is priced in yet and dwarfing the 8.7 billion mc Fitbit which will be lucky to make 1/10th of that.  SO by Wall St logic the Apple Watch should be worth about 87 billion dollars.  But instead, it's worth zero to them. I know it is too bad Apple cannot buy back right now, not until July 25th I think, but this is the perfect time for everyone else to buy AAPL as 120 doesn't even price in the full value of the iPhone, not to mention all the rest.  And Apple will fight back against this nonsense as son as they can, do not worry. Blackout is during a quiet period before earnings, then the blackout is lifted. I imaging you will see AAPL improve approaching July 27th. Blowout earning are expected. New iPhone 6S will be a big hit due to improvements and continued demand for larger phones..
