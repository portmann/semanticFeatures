ETF Hub Dec 23 2015, 19:16 ET | About: Intel Corporation (INTC) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) November hiring of Qualcomm vet Murthy Renduchintala to head a new and massive Client and Internet of Things Businesses and Systems Architecture Group is just one of many noteworthy recent hires of outsiders, observes long-time chip analyst and Linley Group chief Linley Gwennap. Renduchintala's arrival was preceded by the 2014 hiring of Amir Faintuch, previously the head of Qualcomm's Atheros Wi-Fi chip unit, to head Intel's Platform Engineering Group (handles chip R&D). Gwennap notes Faintuch, who once more reports to Renduchintala, has "already brought in other outsiders such as Anwar Awad (from Synopsys), Amit Baruch (Samsung), Shawn Covell (Qualcomm), Mark Davis (Via Telecom), Charlie Matar (AMD), Ari Rauch (AMD), and Howard Wright (Qualcomm) to hold VP-level positions." He sees the hiring spree potentially changing a "not invented here" culture at Intel, and in doing so shortening chip development cycles and improving Intel's ability to go after non-core markets. A greater willingness to use ARM CPU cores (previously strongly discouraged by management) is also deemed a possibility. Gwennap cautions such a management/culture shakeup can be disruptive and alienate employees if not handled well. "The key is for the new managers to recognize Intel’s many strengths, including industry-leading IC technology, excellent engineers, and a broad IP portfolio. If they can harness these strengths while improving workflow and accelerating development time, Intel will have a better chance at winning in new markets." How long does it take to stop an air craft carrier that has been heading in the wrong direction for since at least 2008? Corporate Internal Culture change at INTEL may take  a long, long time. Other outsiders have been brought in in the past and have blended instead of disrupting the unhealthy culture that permeates INTEL. I would tend to agree. This ship has massive internal optimizations around x86. For reasons I am not understanding, Intel's cost structure does not seem able to position and thrive at the IoT and consumer electronic price points outside of PCs/laptops. Fully let loose, I'd not be willing to bet against them with some ARM or ARM/x86 dual architecture, but political battles inside of Intel, I would bet, would undermine such efforts.
