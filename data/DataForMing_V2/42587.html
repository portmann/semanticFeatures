Walt Disney - 2 Thumbs Up For 'Avengers: Age Of Ultron' Overseas Release And 2015 Outlook - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Avengers: Age of Ultron box office results are setting new first weekend records. Disney will release a series of potentially big-hit movies over the next two years. Whether you like superhero movies or not, investors will be big fans of potential earnings from Walt Disney's (NYSE: DIS ) Avengers: Age of Ultron box office results. The Avengers sequel already is setting new records in Hong Kong and other major movie markets. In its first weekend open, the movie has grossed $201 million. Pretty good for a movie that cost $250 million to produce. And that's not including China, where the film will be released in May along with the US. Japan gets it in July. It's beating the recent hit movie Transformers: Age of Extinction. Previous Marvel movies like the first Avengers movie and Iron Man 3 seem to be no match, with Age of Ultron quickly surpassing their opening weekend revenues . Expected to be the top grossing film of 2015, projected US domestic gross alone could be over $750 million. That bodes well for Disney, which has a long, thick pipeline of movies coming out over the next several years. The Star Wars franchise will have two movies out by 2017, and the sequels for Pirates of the Caribbean, Frozen, Toy Story, as well as new live-action recreations of classic Disney movies, should give Disney a steady stream of hits and revenues. Owning Pixar, Marvel and LucasFilms- three powerhouse movie production companies- could keep Disney in the lead in box office sales for years to come. Simply as a film production company alone, Disney would be the envy of many industry competitors, yet there are also the TV shows, cable network channels like ESPN, the numerous theme parks around the world and many product lines of movie-themed toys. Disney's earnings are forecast to rise in the double digits in coming years and long term may achieve an average annual 10%-11% growth over the next five years. I imagine there could be room above that since past growth trends had EPS growth in the high teens, early twenties. The stock has been a strong gainer, up about 40% in the last twelve months. On Monday, it set a new all-time high of $111.60 before closing at $110.16. Due to the surprisingly strong results of Age of Ultron film, analysts are upping their earnings targets for 2015 and beyond. Jason B Bazinet, a CitiGroup analyst, is projecting $4.81 - $4.88 EPS for the full year, up around 14% from $4.26 in fiscal 2014. He's also bumping up 2016 and 2017 estimates to $5.96 and $6.33 per share, respectively. Other analysts are following suit with their own earnings upgrades. In the past three years, while EPS grew an average annual 19%, net income margins increased, showing the company was getting more bang for their revenue buck. As for the balance sheet, Disney has about a $5 billion cash position versus $12.6 billion in long-term debt as of December 2014. Debt to equity is about 38%, so there are no concerns for a profitable company such as this with rising free cash flow. Compared to fiscal 2014 net income of $7.5 billion, long-term debt is less than two times bigger, showing Disney to be financially solid overall. In the first quarter fiscal 2015, we are seeing a continuation of the previous trend where operating income is growing faster than revenues. That can occur if operating margins are rising. However, not everything is perfect. Media Networks, in charge of TV show production, had the smallest gain in operating income among the segments (3%) yet revenues were up 11%. Higher production costs and lower advertising revenue due to lower ratings for its ESPN sports cable network business led to lower operating income. Source: Walt Disney, Q1 2015 Earnings Report Cable network may see other challenges coming from online streaming competition and further pressure to reduce pricing for its sports shows, which are some of the more expensive. This could become a concern since Media Networks is the largest revenue and earnings generator among the segments. The strong growth in Studio Entertainment, in charge of film productions, and Consumer Products should be able to offset that weakness. Disney's stock story is getting stronger. Trading currently at 19 times forward earnings, a reasonable price multiple for the expected growth, I believe Disney has good growth potential, and is a solid stock worth owning.
