9 Investment and Financial Apps for the Apple Watch Last month the long-awaited Apple Watch was released — and eager Apple lovers ate it up. Current projections state that the Apple Watch sold more in one day than its Android counterpart did in all of 2014 (ouch). Not only that, but it sold out in minutes during its pre-order date. The Apple Watch is the latest in wearable technology. Need to check your email? Monitor your fitness levels? Scroll through social media? Itâ€™s all possible with the Apple Watch. In addition to using the Apple Watch for keeping up-to-date with your email, social media, etc. you can also use the Apple Watch in tandem with various investment and financial apps. These companies understand the massive reach that Apple has and have adapted their technology to cater to those with Apple Watches. If you have an Apple Watch or are thinking of getting one, here are 9 investment and financial apps you can use. Are you looking for low fees, high returns and minimal effort when it comes to investing? Betterment might be your answer. This robo advisor has made a splash on the scene because of its low fees and easy access. You can start investing with Betterment with as little as $100 — and if you canâ€™t do that, you can pay less and opt for a $3 per month flat fee. According to their website, â€œThrough diversification, automated rebalancing, better behavior, and lower fees, Betterment customers can expect 4.30% higher returns than a typical DIY investor.â€?

Personal Capital has been a popular choice in the robo advisor space for folks looking to take their finances to the next level with their investments. Personal Capital is similar to Mint, but reigns supreme in the investment realm. But with the release of the Apple Watch, Personal Capital is adding an oft-requested feature: the ability to track your spending. Users are able to set spending targets, based on your average monthly spending. The Apple Watch feature displays a progress bar of how much you are spending in relation to your monthly target. If you overspend, the progress bar turns red and shows that you are over your monthly target. This new feature can help users see exactly where their money is going and track their spending on-the-go.

According to their blog , Mint reviews your spending for three months in 18 â€œfunâ€? categories such as dining, entertainment, etc. Mint then encourages you to set a monthly â€œfunâ€? spending goal, which users can easily change and update. This particular addition adds a new dimension to Mint and offers Mint and Apple Watch users insight into just how much they can spend on â€œfunâ€?.
