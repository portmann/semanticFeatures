Verizon CFO: We're keeping Huffington Post, not buying Dish Network - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha To screen ETFs by asset class, performance, yield and more, check out the ETF Hub. ETF Hub Jun 15 2015, 19:30 ET | About: Verizon Communications (VZ) | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) isn't looking to sell the Huffington Post, CFO Fran Shammo says. And despite the company's move into video, it's not interested in buying spectrum-rich Dish Network (NASDAQ: DISH ) either. Speculation recently has centered on whether AOL 's content assets, which include HuffPost as well as TechCrunch, were a fit in a $4.4B Verizon acquisition deal said to be focused on AOL's ad technology. Shammo said Verizon likes all of the AOL portfolio and hopes to keep it together. As for spectrum, he says if Verizon wanted more, it would have bought more at the last FCC AWS-3 auction.
