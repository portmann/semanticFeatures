Apple suppliers higher after Apple's earnings - Cirrus Logic, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRUS) | Seeking Alpha Oct 27 2015, 19:48 ET | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor Apple beat estimates with the help of ASP/margin strength and 99% Greater China growth, reported 48M iPhone sales (consensus was around 48.5M), and guided for FQ1 revenue of $75.5B-$77.5B vs. a $77.1B consensus. The numbers are good enough for chip suppliers hammered yesterday thanks to Dialog Semi's Q3 report to move higher. Cirrus Logic (NASDAQ: CRUS ) is up 2% after hours ahead of tomorrow afternoon's FQ2 report. Skyworks (NASDAQ: SWKS ) is up 1.7%, Avago (NASDAQ: AVGO ) is up 2%, InvenSense ( INVN - reports tomorrow) is up 2.2%, NXP ( NXPI - reports tomorrow) is up 1.3%, and Qorvo (NASDAQ: QRVO ) is up 1%. Perplexing isn't it. My theory is AAPL after hours activity was the result of the get rich quick folks bailing. Looking for an AAPL upward trend over the next month. No data point from any supplier is particularly revealing as to the iPhone's sales trend, as Tim Cook has repeatedly cautioned.
