Should Visa, MasterCard Fear IBM? - International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) | Seeking Alpha Mar. 20, 2015  2:16 PM ET  |  About: International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) , Includes: AAPL , MA , VA by: Stone Fox Capital IBM is reportedly working on a digital cash technology to work with global currencies. Such a digital payments network could have major repercussions for the high margins of Visa and MasterCard. The technology concept has an interesting twist considering the partnership IBM is forging with Apple and the ability to connect this network with Apple Pay. Last week, Reuters broke news that IBM (NYSE: IBM ) was working on adopting bitcoin technology to potentially develop a form of digital cash for a payments system. The details are sketchy at this point, but the news should give pause to a few high-priced stocks in the payments processing sector. While on the surface it doesn't appear logical or much of a threat for a stumbling technology giant to enter the payments arena, the reality is that it highlights the major themes that concern investing in Visa (NASDAQ: VA ) and MasterCard (NYSE: MA ). With the major concern for the payment processors that digital cash could connect a recent partner of IBM that just happens to be at the forefront of mobile payments in the form of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). The key to this thesis is that whether or not IBM succeeds or even moves forward with this digital payments system is not the major concern for Visa and MasterCard. The reason that even a laggard like IBM is looking at such a system exists for a few prime reasons that should give every investor in these two payment processors a reason to pause. According to the report, IBM is looking at using the blockchain technology behind bitcoin to create a digital cash and payment system for major currencies such as the U.S. Dollar, Euro, and Japanese Yen. For people not familiar with bitcoin, it was created as a digital currency to replace existing currencies and avoid the high costs of existing payment processing networks such as Visa and MasterCard. Some of the other benefits of bitcoin and other digital currencies include privacy, security and speed. Interested parties can read more about it at bitcoin.org . The important detractions of the concept of a virtual currency is the wildly fluctuating value along with the view that it requires a technology background to understand has left it mostly on the fringe. Step in IBM to take advantage of the best features of digital currencies including speed, security and low costs with the existing global currencies and the concept suddenly becomes interestingly viable. The fact that central banks will control the proposed systems would make it even more legitimate for most businesses to use. The part that isn't clear at this point is whether the digital currency would link to existing bank accounts or some form of digital wallet. The main assumption though is that the payment processing networks of Visa and MasterCard would be removed from the process similar to how bitcoin works. A couple of prime reasons exist for why IBM would want to create a digital cash network to take on the payment processors. Anybody taking a quick look at the market caps and margins wouldn't take long to realize why not only IBM, but the whole world wants a piece of the profits. For 2015, analysts forecast IBM generating $85 billion in revenue while the market cap sits at $160.4 billion. At the same time, Visa and MasterCard combine for revenue around $24 billion and a market of nearly double that of IBM. *Note the chart appears to have a glitch with the V market cap during 2015 possibly related to the stock split. It currently sits at nearly $170 billion based on 2.5 billion shares after the split. The main reason that these two stocks achieve such large market caps despite relatively low revenues is the incredible operating margins produced by a duopoly. Most investors don't seem to understand that the biggest risk is the unknown. Just like IBM had its mainframe computers replaced ironically partially by computers from Apple, Visa and MasterCard face threats that might not even exist now. The absurd margins will continue to attract entrepreneurs from around the globe and technology giants like IBM and Apple. At the same time, analysts like Nomura continue to push the bullish theme of rising payments volumes around the globe. The analyst though highlights the very reason the market is coming for these payment processors with new technology: no margin-pinching rewards programs or needs for reserves like banks. The big payment item of 2015 is Apple Pay. The technology allows consumers to securely store bank accounts and credit card accounts on a mobile phone and complete transactions in a quick and efficient manner. What it doesn't do currently is eliminate the payment processors from the puzzle. It allows Apple to collect a small fee that comes from the banks and doesn't eat into the profits of Visa and MasterCard. The IBM news is intriguing because the technology giant is working with Apple on enterprise apps for the iOS operating system. The two already have a strong partnership and it would appear logical for IBM to create a digital payment network that ties into Apple Pay and bypasses the high costs of the current payment networks. Apple and IBM could collect fees though at substantially lower rates than charged by Visa and MasterCard. Clearly the story is extremely early to make an investment in IBM or Apple based solely on this news, but it continues the theme of why Visa and MasterCard are dangerous stocks to own. Both payment networks are already struggling to maintain reasonable growth rates for the valuation so any hit to margins will stall out the stocks. One needs to consider that if Visa traded at only 5x 2015 revenue estimates, the stock would have a value of only $69 billion. This news isn't going to cause Visa to collapse today, but investors buying the stock only see the bull case of global cash transitioning to plastic cards. The projection that bitcoin, Apple Pay, or some new technology would eventually eat into the margins of Visa might ironically turn into a combination of all three options. The thesis of avoiding the payment processors is maintained. At the same time, the news continues to keep us invested in a turnaround at IBM and the momentum at Apple.
