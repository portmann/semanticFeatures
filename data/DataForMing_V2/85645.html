Microsoft Scores First As Gaming World Shifts Attention To E3 2015 - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha MSFT announces partnership with FB's Oculus Rift for virtual reality gaming starting in Q1 2016. Partnership will include Xbox One game streaming, Windows 10 gaming integration on Oculus VR headset along with Xbox One controllers with every Rift purchase. Meant to compete with Sony's Project Morpheus, but minimizing investment risk, enables MSFT to work on ecosystem integration instead. Only downside - Q1 2016 misses 2015 holiday season. Investing will revolve around MSFT and FB into the second half of 2016. The weeks leading up to the E3 expo bring numerous rumors from the video game industry regarding product launches, new hardware and main industry players setting themselves up for the second half of 2015 and beyond. While this year is expected to focus on upgrades to console systems and gaming franchises from independent and AAA developers, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) got things started with a bang by announcing a partnership with Facebook-backed (NASDAQ: FB ) Oculus to bring virtual reality gaming to the Xbox One and new Windows 10 operating system, giving the console developer an early jump on rival Sony (NYSE: SNE ) and its own VR headset. Set to hit the shelves during the first quarter of 2016, the latest incarnation of the Oculus Rift will be sold with an Xbox One game controller as a package deal, which will enable the headset to work with streaming Xbox One games and on Windows 10-compatible PCs and tablets, an operating system that Microsoft has been pushing consumers to install. Games also will be available on the Rift system as well, and Oculus announced nearly $10 million in incentives for independent developers to create games on this new system, which would provide consumers with what would hopefully be a strong initial library of streamed Microsoft-compatible games and ones designed specifically for Oculus' virtual reality interface. With the inclusion of Microsoft as a main gaming partner, analysts predict that both companies can feed off each other as video game development moves away from consoles and into the realm of virtual and augmented reality. Oculus Rift won't be the only virtual reality helmet on offer, though. Sony, Microsoft's main rival in the video game space, announced that it would be releasing its own virtual reality headset, Project Morpheus, in the "first half" of 2016 as well, and will likely include access to Sony's much touted video game library, a main advantage over Microsoft in this current generation of consoles. However, Sony's machine is financed and serviced by the company itself, which makes it a risky investment for what many are considering to be the new frontier of gaming. Microsoft, on the other hand, went out and partnered with a company that has its own deep-pocketed backer in Facebook, which means Microsoft can devote its time to being a content partner and a game streamer. By enabling Oculus games to be played with a familiar console controller to many gamers, as well as access to a library of popular titles within the Xbox ecosystem, Oculus Rift can enable gamers to experiment with new technology while keeping one foot in their comfort zone, making it more accessible to gamers than Project Morpheus on those grounds alone. For its part, Microsoft can focus its attention on consolidating its gaming enterprises for Xbox and Windows, creating an ecosystem similar to the one enjoyed by Apple or Samsung. If the reality of Oculus Rift and virtual reality gaming lives up to the expectations, the state of the video game industry as we know it will be dramatically different. But what does this mean for investors? While Microsoft's video game division isn't as important to the company's fortunes as the PlayStation is to Sony, the combination of virtual reality gaming along with the integration of the Xbox and Windows ecosystems could flip the script on the console wars, which has been in Sony's favor for the past two years. Unfortunately, the release is happening in Q1 2016 rather than the holiday-backed shopping season of Q4 2015, reducing the potential initial success of the new system. However, it could give Microsoft a chance to get ahead of the game during an otherwise quiet time for the industry and the vaguer timeframe for the soon-to-be rival Project Morpheus. This would make Microsoft and Facebook both long-term plays, with the bigger upside coming in the second half of 2016, which would be Oculus' first holiday season and would give the system another round at E3 to woo the gaming public. Facebook likely stands to gain more than Microsoft as Oculus Rift's main benefactor and will feature more prominently in the eyes of the company's shareholders, but both companies will rise or fall together, depending on whether or not virtual reality is the future of gaming, or just another fad. E3 hasn't started yet, but Microsoft is already off to a good start with this pre-convention announcement. It will be interesting to see what the company says during its press conference on June 15, as well as Sony's rebuttal.
