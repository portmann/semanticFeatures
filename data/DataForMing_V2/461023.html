Netflix: There May Be A Buying Opportunity Today - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Netflix's pending price hikes have the potential to alter subscriber patterns. In addition to straight-up cancellations, the hikes may also spur consolidations of accounts into higher-stream Premium subscriptions. Such consolidation may appear like an adverse subscriber reaction. But in fact, the per stream cost would be going down, which would leave room to recoup the revenue losses through further hikes. If Netflix subscribers do surprise to the downside, but revenue declines are proportionately less, investors should buy any resulting dip. As Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) prepares to announce its second quarter earnings after close today, general expectations are for a typical second quarter: lower growth than in other quarters, but still generally positive trends. This may not be correct this time around. There is some potential for a downside surprise on subscriber numbers in the U.S. But if such a surprise happens, it will likely be deceptive, an apparent weakening of Netflix's customer appeal that is actually not happening. Such a showing might produce an opportunity for investors to buy in on a dip in the stock. Although Netflix had only one $7.99 streaming plan when it first launched its Internet video offering, it has since upgraded that to three separate tiers of streaming plans: Basic, Standard, and Premium. Basic offers one stream at a time, Standard Definition only, for $8. Standard is $10 for two streams in SD or HD. Premium is $12 for four streams in SD/HD/UHD. What is today the $7.99 a month plan is actually not the old $7.99 a month plan. That plan, the Standard plan, now costs $9.99. However, Netflix allowed long-time customers to continue to access the Standard plan for $8, what was once the Standard price but is now the Basic price for new customers. But this $2 savings was a grandfathering scheme, not a generally applicable discount. You couldn't use it to buy Basic for $6 or Premium for $10. It only applied to the plan customers had at the time prices went up. And when prices went up there weren't three separate plans available. The Basic plan wasn't even available yet (it was created the same day the price hike was announced, at the old $8 price) and the Premium plan was already $12 and wasn't increased , so people on those plans got no discounts. Customers also lost the grandfathering if they changed plans. This means that everyone who is facing a price hike in the coming months is on a Standard plan. When the price hike was announced Netflix had around 37 million domestic subscribers. Today it has 47 million, so at least 10 million subscribers are already paying the higher rates. Some estimates also have as many as another 10 million subscribers having already left their grandfathered plans, but even that estimate has more than half of Netflix's U.S. customer base facing a 25% price increase. Broadly speaking, Netflix customers are commonly seen as having two options: put up with the increase, or cancel. Most analysts are expecting that Netflix will see some churn, but that it will be more than outweighed by the revenue gains. The ballpark for cancellations is around 500,000, spread over the remainder of this year. Figure about 100,000 hike-induced cancellations in the current quarter since they didn't even start until mid-May. The company is guiding to 500,000 net additions in U.S. subscribers, notwithstanding the cancellations. Analysts are divided on that figure, however. But even the skeptical analysts are, I think, skeptical for the wrong reasons. Basically, they think more people will cancel than expected, taking door number two instead of door number one. But that ignores the fact that customers actually have a third option. Instead of keeping their Standard plan or cancelling it, they can upgrade to the Premium plan. That has obvious implications for revenue, but actually it has implications for subscriber count as well. Those who upgrade to the Premium plan from the Standard get two benefits. First, they can watch Ultra-High Definition where it is available. Second, they move from two streams to four. At $12 a month, that comes to $3 per stream. Meanwhile, the Standard plan, which had cost $4 per stream at the grandfathered rate, now costs $5 per stream. In other words, for just $2 more a month, Netflix subscribers on the old Standard plan can get two more streams and UHD content to boot. This can be either a positive or a negative for Netflix. Positive side first. Some subscribers may choose to upgrade to the four-stream plan solely to get access to the UHD content. While anyone still on a grandfathered plan obviously wasn't willing to pay $4 a month to upgrade, hiking the price by $2 also means Netflix has cut the upgrade cost in half, so maybe some more will take the plunge now. That would be an unqualified positive for Netflix, as its revenue per subscriber per month would go up by $4 instead of $2. But there is also a potential downside. With the price hike, Netflix is also increasing the incentives for account sharing. Since the Premium plan has twice as many streams available as the Standard plan, it is conceivable that two Standard accounts could be consolidated into one Premium account, actually reducing Netflix revenue from $16 for those two accounts to $12. Unlike straight up cancellations, this wouldn't necessarily show up in a consumer survey. These subscribers would still be keeping Netflix, just changing how they structure their relationship with it. Account sharing is already possible, of course, and financially speaking already desirable since two Standard plans are already more expensive than one Premium plan. But just as the price change may cause some customers to take a fresh look at upgrading to a UHD plan, it may also cause other customers to take a fresh look at the idea of partnering with a neighbor, roommate, cousin, coworker, sibling, or any one of those 47 million domestic subscribers. Because Netflix's new pricing structure has the potential to alter how customers approach getting access to Netflix content, subscriber counts may be affected more than a straight up cancellation analysis would suggest. If Netflix sees two Standard accounts consolidated into one Premium account, its revenue from those two accounts will only drop 25%. But its subscriber count would drop 50%. So even if Netflix surprises to the downside with its subscriber account this evening, the significance of that won't be apparent without checking the revenue number more closely. If revenue per account jumps more than expected, that will be a strong indicator that some of those "cancellations" are actually consolidations. Those consolidations would, in turn, offer potential further revenue increases in the future. As I said, the cost per stream on the Premium plan is actually lower than even the cost per stream on the old, grandfathered Standard plan, even though the quality of the streams is higher. If Netflix does see a lot of consolidation over the remainder of 2016 as it phases out grandfathering, it may well be able to raise the Premium plan price to $16 or even $18 in the future, putting the per stream cost at or above the old per stream cost, and putting Netflix itself on a pricing par with HBO. While market sentiment about Netflix has often closely tracked subscriber count following earnings releases, that may no longer be the most accurate indicator of Netflix's customer engagement and earning potential. If there is a downside surprise on subscribers this evening, and that surprise prompts a sell-off, I recommend buying the dip.
