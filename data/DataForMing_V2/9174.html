Myth Vs. Reality With Apple's Stock Buyback - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple announces grandiose plans like $90 billion in capital returned by the end of 2015, and it is useful to study how much money actually goes toward retiring Apple stock. A closer look at Apple's buyback program indicates that about $80 billion of the company's buyback program from 2012-2015 is used to actually reduce the share count. Apple's buyback program, which started during the 2012-2013 year, retires about 4%-6% of the company's stock per year. One of the hardest things with studying a company's stock buyback program is that the actual amount of retired shares is often less than the advertised rate announced by the company. There's much fanfare when companies announce a stock buyback worth billions of dollars, but what's useful for shareholders is the actual reduction in the share count that enables the investor to be entitled to more earnings per share (and the appurtenant dividends) as a result of the buyback. The difficulty is that stock buyback evaluation is often a lagging exercise - you have to wait years for the actual share repurchases to take place before you can get a clear idea of the stock repurchase program's efficiency. In the case of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), many investors remember the tech giant's declaration in April 2014 that it was increasing its share repurchase authorization from $60 billion to $90 billion, and it expected to complete the buyback program by the end of 2015. There are three annual periods of Apple's buyback that we should evaluate. It had never repurchased any stock prior to its 2012 announcement that it would begin a buyback program, and the relevant examination periods are the 2012-2013, 2013-2014 and the 2014-2015 years of buyback activity. During the 2012-2013 period, Apple reduced its share count from 6.574 billion to 6.294 billion for a share count reduction of 4.25%. The company actually reduced the share count by 280 million shares, and the median price of the stock that year was $79.55. This works out to $22.27 billion spent on the stock. When you study the 2013-2014 period, you will see that Apple reduced its share count from 6.294 billion to 5.866 billion. This reduced the share count by 6.80% over the course of the year. This period reduced the share count by 428 million. This examination period provided a clear example of why long-term investors benefit more form share buybacks at lower prices, as the median price of shares repurchased was $68.60. The company spent $29.3 billion on buybacks during this comparison period, but the increased share count reduction can be explained by the lower price of the stock just as much as it can be explained by more company funds dedicated to retiring the stock. And then there is the 2014-2015 period. Apple's stock is expected to decline from 5.866 billion to 5.625 billion. If that happens, the share count will be reduced by a little over 4%. The average price of the repurchased stock will probably be around $120, and the share count should decline by around 241 million. This works out to $28.9 billion spent on reducing shares. Of course, the 2014-2015 period is just an estimate, and is subject to Apple's share prices over the rest of the year as well as the amount of money that Apple actually dedicates toward the stock buyback. Still, this information is useful for those who are interested in the mechanics of Apple's actual buyback program rather than headlines that exclaim things like $90 billion in buybacks by the end of 2015. The reality is probably around $22.2 billion + $29.3 billion + $28.9 billion for $80.4 billion actually getting spent toward the direct retiring of shares rather than actions that are used to mop up additional shares to prevent dilution. Apple is retiring around 4-6% of its stock each year, and that's more useful to investors than hearing eye-popping numbers that are difficult to connect to the bottom line without examining the percentage decline in shares outstanding. These buybacks have been useful for investors. For instance, Apple made $39.5 billion in 2014 profits compared to $41.7 billion in profits in 2012. Over those two years, Apple's profits actually declined by 5.27%. However, because Apple retired around 700 million shares of stock over that period, it was actually able to report earnings per share growth from $6.31 in 2012 to $6.45 in 2014 because the share count had been reduced by a greater rate than the profit decline. This buyback program is important in that explains why Apple will be able to raise its dividend and grow profits per share in the coming years. When you make around $40 billion in profits per year, it's difficult to move the needle and experience high organic earnings per share growth. However, because Apple's dividend payout ratio is only 28%, it has a lot of available retained profits that it can use to reduce the share count. Because Apple is permanently retiring 4%-6% of its stock annually, investors have a built-in growth mechanism that can move the profits per share forward even through the years when it is difficult to move organic profits beyond that $40 billion mark.
