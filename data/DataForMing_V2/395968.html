Verizon Is Undervalued - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha This valuation focuses on intrinsic and extrinsic valuation methods (discounted cash flows and multiples). Verizon is trading at significantly lower multiples than its US peers. This valuation focuses on two methods: discounted cash flows analysis (DCF), and comparable companies analysis using multiples. This will be a purely quantitative rationale for a long position in Verizon (NYSE: VZ ), for a more qualitative rationale, check out my article on the future prospects of the wireless telecommunications industry. Displayed in the graphs below are the P/E and TEV/EBITDA multiples for the top wireless telecommunications companies in the US: Verizon, AT&T (NYSE: T ), T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS ), Sprint (NYSE: S ). From these graphs it is clear to see that Verizon has been trading at lower multiples than these other companies which points towards undervaluation. However, this is but a small portion of the picture, these graphs help most by showing historical valuations for these companies which can be helpful in coming to any educated conclusion. To better assess the value of a company's stock using extrinsic measurements one should make use of a comp. table with similar companies operating in similar markets. Shown below is a comp. table I have build using a number of, in my opinion, key trading multiples to assess how Verizon is being valued compared to peers. From this table it is clear to see that Verizon falls below average in most categories except P/BV. This, I think, can be partially attributed to their capital structure (which is why I have added the debt/equity metric). Having significant more operational leverage than similar companies can end up skewing the P/BV multiple. Taking this into account I weighted it lower than P/E and TEV/EBITDA in my calculation of the average implies share price (.4, .4, .2). The result of this comparative analysis is an implied share price of $60.29 and an under valuation of 18% compared to its last close of $50.94 (Friday April 29th, 2016). Once an implied price has been achieved through extrinsic analysis it is good to use an intrinsic method of valuation to ensure that a more complete picture is obtained. Before going into my DCF analysis I would like to lay out the assumptions that went into its construction as they can have a significant impact on the outcome. The first and possibly largest assumptions pertain to revenue growth and margins moving forwards. With respect to revenue analyst projections where used up until 2018 when I "straight-lined" revenue growth up to the long-term growth rate of 1%. As for the margins I simply took the average of the past three years and applied it across all years as they are too variable to be able to accurately predict. Second, I did not have access to the yield to maturity of Verizon's debt so a conservative 10% cost of debt was used. If anything this will end up understating the implied price which makes for a more fair valuation (I always like to air on the side of conservatism). Third, I used the NYU stern method for adjusting the unlevered beta which give a more realistic value that is closer to 1, as all stocks' betas tend towards 1 into perpetuity. As shown in the model above, according to my calculations, Verizon's equity is undervalued by 23.64%. Please note that DCF valuations are incredibly subjective and can vary substantially depending on the assumptions made. Regardless, after performing this valuation I do believe that Verizon Wireless shows potential for growth and is an opportunity for a long position.
