Wal-Mart Will Hold Its Own Against Amazon For 4 Reasons - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. Wal-Mart's return to its roots in the U.S. necessitate its fever-pitch activity in the online arena. Company is in a position to leverage cash and take advantage of its on-the-ground infrastructure to build its online presence in a strong way. In addition to technology spend, they're also going more granular in how they service their customers and put convenience at the top of the priority list. Wal-Mart's (NYSE: WMT ) brand positioning is very simple: buy here to get the lowest price you can possibly get on everything it sells. That's what their business model has always been, and it's worked extremely well for them. Now, however, technology has crept into the equation, threatening a chunk of their business. Can they thwart the attacks of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and retain their position as Alpha Retailer in the online space as well? I believe they can, and that they've already put the wheels into motion. Wal-Mart has always invested in technology, but for many years that money has gone into tightening their supply chain and making it more efficient, improving their logistics capabilities and optimizing inventory management. Over the past two years, however, the direction of focus is changing. From concentrating on technology that facilitates internal efficiency they are gradually moving outward - to investing in technology that is customer-facing. Last year they spent $700 million to build their e-commerce platform and capabilities; this year they intend to see $900 million in similar expenditure; next year that number is expected to hit $1.1 billion . In a previous article on Wal-Mart I covered their operating margins, showing how they dipped from 7.8% in to 7.4% in 2015. I hold that we will see that being repeated in 2016 as they step up their technology spend and invest in multiple online channels including upgrades to its mobile app. As of the December 16, 2015 update , the app allows you to check-in at the store before you get there, making your shopping experience quicker than ever. An earlier update in October provided a Wish List feature for holiday shoppers. The spend itself is not what impresses me. After all, Amazon spends $10 billion on technology R&D so WMT's expense of $1.1 billion next year is pretty much dwarfed by that. The biggest advantage that Wal-Mart has over Amazon et al is not its money power. It is the fact that its online presence is now being supported by a backbone of new Neighborhood Markets. In addition, over the past few quarters they've been testing grocery pick-up points at these Neighborhood Market parking lots, eliminating the need for buyers to even leave their cars to get their groceries. In this graph above, what we're seeing is a near threefold estimated increase in sales between fiscals 2011 and 2016, which will put e-comm sales at 3%+ of overall estimated revenue by the end of 2016. Now, if you quickly come back to the present day scenario you'll see Wal-Mart doing $12.2 billion in online sales as of 2014 versus Amazon's $89 billion . Not a threat, you say? I disagree. Here are four reasons: 1. Wal-Mart has consistently been profitable - something Amazon has only just started to do. In the recent quarter Amazon's operating margin in North America retail was 3.5% against much higher levels that Wal-Mart has regularly brought in. 3. Wal-Mart's international foray hasn't gone too well for them in several countries, so their focal point has shifted back to the United States in the form of stores with smaller footprints supporting (and supported by) online sales. When they crack that Wal-nut open, the natural thing for them to do would be to use the new business model to reclaim international markets where their original cheaper-than-anyone model was spurned. 4. Wal-Mart has nearly $7 billion in cash as of the last quarter. That means they can leverage it to keep their margins under control while gradually increasing their technology spend. Amazon may not have that kind of leverage because their spend on tech R&D is already among the highest in the world and their margins aren't that hot to begin with. The only downside I can see to all this is that Amazon investors don't expect the company to tighten its margins in the near future, while Wal-Mart's investors do. As long as they can show growth and expansion, investors will continue to support them. But for how long? You can already see a flattening of stock price, specifically over the second half of the quarter just gone. Have investors finally decided that they want profitability as part of AMZN's package? If that's the case, it could spell trouble for the king of online retail. What I've covered above will not help Wal-Mart's stock magically scale and sail past $70 or even $65 this very quarter. However, I believe that they're working in the right direction internally and externally to reverse what's been happening since the beginning of 2015. Consistent profitability and admirable cost-control capabilities I think this is exactly the right time to add WMT to your portfolio. At at forward PE of 13 it may still look a bit pricey to some, but you're not likely to get such an opportunity for a while. Once the earnings starts improving, which is definitely going to take some time, expectations will once again soar and you may not see prices like this again for a long time...the operative word being "long." In the end it's not about Wal-Mart ousting Amazon to become the world's largest online retailer - it's about a behemoth that most people call outdated showing young blood that retail courses through its veins and that it can take on any up-and-coming company and play the game just as well as them.
