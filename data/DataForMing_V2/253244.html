AMD Is Still A Buy, Despite Being Up Over 30% - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) | Seeking Alpha AMD gained market share in Q3 from NVIDIA, despite shortages in its new Fury line. Despite going up over 30% since I first advised people to buy AMD, the stock is a buy. It's been a little more than a month since I wrote an article on AMD (NASDAQ: AMD ), and a few months since I mentioned it was a good stock to purchase . In that time, it's gone up over 30%, while many have advised how the company is in a death spiral, or otherwise was heading for death. Unfortunately, for many readers, it's difficult to know who to believe, so opportunities are missed. Understanding the technology market is not simple or easy, and many writers use general ideas based on vague notions that are often applicable in similar situations. I will explain a few that are advanced, and why they are sometimes misguided and not entirely applicable. I will also comment on some news events since my last article. One of the least plausible lines of reasoning involves AMD going out of business before it can release its new product line. This is so patently false, I feel silly even mentioning it, but it should be addressed. Many of the losses AMD has suffered this year are "paper" losses, not operating losses, so using those figures is intentionally misleading. More than that, even using that rate, the company would still have enough cash or flexible credit to have time to release the next generation x86 core, and GPU architecture. Another somewhat related fallacy involves the impact of AMD's shrinking R&D budget on its ability to remain in business. A corollary to this is that companies like Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA ), by virtue of their larger R&D budgets, will always make better products. Or the similarly poor remarks about how AMD is stretching itself too thin by competing with both companies. Of course, the latter is why AMD defeated both Intel and NVIDIA and won this generation of consoles. It could not be more false, or easily proven so. In fact, Intel does not have GPU technology anywhere near that of AMD or NVIDIA, and NVIDIA lacks the CPU prowess of Intel or AMD, leaving AMD perfectly situated to take advantage of their ability in both technologies. There is also a belief that having more money to develop a processor will always make it better. This is clearly not true, as Intel has released several poor processors, like the Pentium 4 and Atom, despite enormous budgets, and smaller companies have released superior technology at times, AMD being one of them. Processors are expensive to make, and are getting more expensive, but after a certain point, more money will not make a significant difference. With this in mind, AMD's Zen processor will not be impacted by a shortage of cash, or be inferior because it came from a company with less money than Intel. AMD has more than enough money to fund Zen, provided it was a priority, as we know it has been. AMD's next generation GPU architecture will also have received proper funding to complete the design. In neither case would more funding make a significant difference in the product. Of course, when one has a lower R&D budget, something has to be lost. It is not like the money spent before was all wasted, although certainly some waste can be eliminated. In AMD's case, there are some obvious cases where the smaller R&D budget became very apparent. Very obvious was backing off some commitments to ARM, which has shown very clear delays. The Seattle launch was significantly behind schedule, and the K12 was pushed back at least until 2017, from 2016. We similarly saw the cancellation of Project Skybridge, and the appearance of a 20nm planar Jaguar/Puma derivative. The smaller R&D budget was also very likely responsible for the lack of new technology from AMD on the 28nm planar node, although we did get tweaks. Compared to NVIDIA's updates, they are quite minor by comparison. So, there is an impact, but it's not as significant as many would like it to appear. The company can live with pushing ARM back, since it's not doing well in servers yet, or living with the existing GCN architecture a bit longer than it wanted to. It could not live with compromising the big releases in 2016, and those have not been impacted. It is always important to remember that although the company has been impacted by R&D cuts, it still has the capability of prioritizing the most important projects. Since my last article over a month ago, there have been quite a few news items regarding AMD, which overall are very favorable. We already knew AMD gained market share in the PC market in Q3, but now we have reports from Jon Peddie research indicating the company gained market share in the discrete GPU market as well. Although an increase from 18% to 18.8% may seem minor, it is important to remember that AMD was suffering from shortages in its new Fury line, nor were all the products available for the entire quarter. AMD has also fleshed out its new line with the R9 385, which has been well-received, and offers gamers a solid choice in a heretofore ignored price segment. With DX12 titles coming, which early tests show favoring AMD's GPU technology more than NVIDIA's, it seems a foregone conclusion AMD will continue to gain market share in GPUs, despite a now old architecture. We have also seen the release of AMD's new software suite, which has been very well-received , despite being quite new and having some issues. The performance of the software, the intuitiveness of the interface, and the additional features have all received praise over AMD's previous Catalyst software. AMD's Boltzmann Initiative similarly shows a focus in software, releasing a suite of tools designed to assist developers in leveraging AMD's GPU's for computational purposes. To go with compilers, AMD also has a tool (HIP) to assist developers in porting NVIDIA's CUDA code to C++, which can then leverage AMD's products. We also have the news from AMD indicating that the company has first silicon with Global Foundries on the 14nm FinFET technology, and that Zen has met expectations. It's easy to see why the price of the stock has continued to go up; none of these are signals from a dying company. Astute investors knew AMD would have a very rough 2015, and so it happened. Other things we will not know until 2016 with accuracy, like how well Zen and the next GPU core will perform. But, there have been many positives in 2015. We've seen the very successful FreeSync initiative. We've seen very competitive GPU products in the Fury line, despite an aging architecture. We've seen successful silicon on GF's 14nm FinFET. We've seen the company successfully leverage Mantle to create other APIs that finally can leverage the capabilities of AMD's GPU architecture, while making porting from consoles much easier in the process. We've seen the company successfully increase corporate market share with its CPUs. We've seen the company to continue to improve Professional GPU market share. We've seen AMD continue its important relationship with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). And we've seen AMD finally focus more on software, and show positive results in these efforts. Perhaps most importantly, we've seen the company make the correct decisions in most cases, and prioritize important technologies while delaying or eliminating less important ones. Although many readers may have missed out on the opportunity of buying this company very low when I wrote my article on why it was a buy, it's still very attractive long term at this price. However, short-term drops are more likely now, so investors should have a fairly long time horizon. All in all, while you will continue to have people pointing out this or that issue, or losses in revenue, 2015 could play out no other way. The surprises were largely positive, and the company's long-term strategy has started to play out, and will continue to as we move forward. However, 2016 will still be difficult, although better than 2015, especially as we get to the latter half. In 2017, the company will have a real chance to improve earnings dramatically, but we should know in 2016 how likely this is. That is when we can assess AMD's newest technology generation, which should dictate much of what will happen in the following years.
