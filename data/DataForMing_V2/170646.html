Tricky Times For Yahoo: Cash Out And Move On - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha The IRS denied Yahoo!'s attempts to spin-off 384 million shares of Alibaba stock tax-free; this could cost the company billions. Yahoo! shares have been down in a 12-month period, compared to tech rivals Google and Facebook; Twitter could pose more competition in the news arena. Yahoo! (NASDAQ: YHOO ) continues to struggle to gain leverage in an ever-changing technology landscape as the IRS denied the company's attempts to spin-off 384 million shares of Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) stock tax-free. With rough waters ahead for a firm continually struggling against larger tech rivals, we believe investors should be concerned and consider alternatives. Recent prices show that the move would represent 80 percent of Yahoo's market capitalization of roughly $23.5 billion . If the spin-off takes place and Yahoo must pay taxes on the deal, the IRS would require Yahoo to pay 38 percent of the value of Alibaba stock. Yahoo said it still plans to go ahead with the spin-off. This is based on the company's belief that since the IRS did not initially require taxes on the move, they can avoid the loss. Yahoo's stock price is down from a high of $52.37 in Nov. 2014 to $30.90 in Sep. 2015. During the same time period, Yahoo's biggest competitors, including Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), saw their shares climb from $583.10 to $612.72 and $77.43 to $90.44 respectively. In the second quarter of 2015 , Yahoo posted a rise of 15 percent in revenue yet the company still posted a loss. Yahoo spends heavily to achieve the strong rise in earnings at the expense of profits. Executives warned shareholders that the company foresees expenses to continue throughout the rest of 2015. Yahoo's shareholders are not happy with the news and continue to send the stock price down. In August, Cantor Fitzgerald lowered its earnings estimates on Yahoo from $0.43 per share to $0.31 per share for 2016. Google continues to dominate the playing field in the information and search engine era as more consumers and businesses rely on the company for information and profits. Google's shares continue to rebound from the recent market sell-off. When trying to compare Yahoo to Google in terms of advertising revenue and the search engine market, Yahoo is an also-ran. Strictly looking at advertising revenue, Google generated $60 billion in 2014 while Yahoo generated $1.8 billion in advertising revenue from search results. Although many technology analysts believe that Google cannot remain at the top of the perch forever, Yahoo! does not currently appear to be the company to topple them. With the blow dealt by the IRS, it does not look like Yahoo will close out 2015 as strong as many had hoped. The stock price is down compared to its peers, and the firm's attempts to enter the mobile application market have been relatively dismal . Google continues to dominate the search engine market. Catalysts on the horizon for Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) could make it increasingly difficult for Yahoo! to gain market share in the news space, as well. While the Alibaba spin-off was designed to help Yahoo deliver large gains for its shareholders, now the deal is in jeopardy. Turmoil in China could drive the price of Alibaba stock down further.
