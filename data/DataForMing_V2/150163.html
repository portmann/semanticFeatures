The Chinese Consumer And Apple: A Match Made In The Temple Of Heaven - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Chinese consumers are brand sensitive. This brand sensitivity is enough to withstand any minor rise in price of a luxury good like the iPhone. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is down in the past few months due in part to the uncertainty analysts perceive it faces in the Chinese market. But the concern that the Chinese consumer is going to refrain from buying an iPhone due to a potential price increase or turmoil in the Chinese markets is flawed. Much has been written about how the average Chinese citizen does not have a substantial enough portion of their assets in the stock market to affect how they spend their money from month to month. But Apple's recent decline in particular seems based on a fear that rising iPhone prices due to yuan devaluation will hurt iPhone sales. This fear does not appear to be rooted in the reality of the day-to-day life of the Chinese consumer. The iPhone is a luxury good in China, and Chinese consumers, sensitive to brand and concerned with their reputation, or "face," in society, are not likely to back away from iPhone purchases due to small price increases. Viewed in the context of an emerging upper middle class and in the backdrop of Apple's brand loyalty in the region, China concerns seem overblown. If it seems overly simple, that's probably because it. But I argue that the twin concepts of extreme brand sensitivity and the sociological concept of "face" in China are going to make sure that Apple continues to sustain success in the region. "Face" represents a person's reputation and feelings of prestige within multiple spheres, including the workplace, the family, personal friends, and society at large. First, an article from the China Business Review gives an excellent overview of the mind of the Chinese consumer with regard to brand sensitivity, especially the young Chinese consumer, and the type of consumer I believe is Apple's prime target. The article states that "younger generations are increasingly willing to pay premiums for higher-end products." Chinese consumers generally believe that "the higher the price, the better the quality or the higher the status." The article notes that in one product instance, "young shoppers [were] willing to pay double for foreign-branded infant formula or five to seven times more for foreign bottled mineral water." Another article by The Conference Board Review also took a look at the Chinese consumers and the buying behavior in China and begins to intermix the concepts of brand sensitivity and "face." The article featured an interview with Savio Chan, president and CEO of US China Partners, a consultancy that specializes in American and Chinese business relations. He commented: "Many Chinese will only spend on things that they can show off to other people. Nobody knows when you travel to America and stay at a Motel 6, so what's the point of spending thousands of dollars to stay at the St. Regis? Nobody will ever see that. However, things like luxury goods are very visible to other Chinese friends, so people will spend a lot on them." In essence, he's describing the price elasticity of demand for luxury goods in China. You might say that these types of goods, including the iPhone, are inelastic, or relatively inelastic, that is, changes in price have a small, if any, effect on demand. The Wall Street Journal discussed how the iPhone is a luxury good in China here , noting that "[i]n China, Apple has become the luxury brand most frequently given as a gift, ahead of Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Chanel..." But why do Chinese consumers care about what others see you ask? According to one study on Chinese consumer behavior , it's all about the concept of "face" in China. The article's author, Frans Giele, describes the concept of "face consumption": defined as "the motivational process by which individuals try to enhance, maintain or save self-face, as well as show respect to others' face through the consumption of products. Giele cites a study finding that "due to the heavy influence of face, Asian consumers must purchase luxury products to enhance, maintain or save their face... the conceptualization of face and face consumption provides a useful way to understand why Asian consumers, on the one hand, are very thrifty in their everyday life and consumption, but, on the other hand, spend - and sometimes waste - a large amount of money on luxury consumption." An article in the Harvard Business Review titled "Understanding Chinese Consumers ," also touches upon these intertwined concepts, with its author Zhu noting that "face and social status are critical" and that "[i]f a brand can signal a higher social and/or economic status, Chinese consumers would be happy to pay a premium. If it doesn't, they become very price sensitive." The Wall Street Journal parroted the above discussions by noting that products in China "that are consumed in public, directly or indirectly, command huge price premiums relative to goods used in private. The leading mobile phone brands are international. The leading household appliance brands, by contrast, are cheaply priced domestic makers..." Brand sensitivity and "face" don't matter if the Apple brand in China isn't high on the list of the average Chinese consumer, right? A polling of 13,500 Chinese citizens across 30 cities aged 15 to 60 in 2014 found that Apple was in fact the most powerful brand in the Chinese mobile market. These results were from the China Brand Research Center's 2014 China Brand Power Index. Another survey found that Apple was "by far the loyalty leader among smartphone vendors at 75.4% with Xiaomi a distant second at 28% and Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) in third at 27.9%." Brand sensitivity and "face" have been a part of Chinese culture for years, and will continue to be a part of the future Chinese consumer. Data shows that spending power is on the rise in China , with one study showing that between 2015 and 2025, the share of Chinese urban households in the "global affluent," "mass affluent," and "upper middle class" (defined as having annual income of > 200,000 renminbi, between 100,001 and 200,000 renminbi, and between 40,001 and 100,000 renminbi, respectively) is set to surge. The number falling in the upper-middle-class category, for example, in 2015 was estimated in the study to be 21.5% of Chinese urban households. That number is set to rise to 59.4% by 2025 while the proportion of "lower middle class and poor" households is set to decline from a combined 72.9% to just 29.5%. The proportion of Chinese urban households in the "mass and global" affluent levels is set to double from 6% to 11%. The equation is simple really - a growing population making its way up the income ladder means more Chinese consumers worried about brand, brand loyalty, and "face," thereby resulting in continued Apple iPhone sales. Thought of as a threat to Apple's continued sales in China, Xiaomi is admittedly experiencing a boom in the region, and continues to be the #1 smartphone vendor. But I have yet to see any data convincing me that Xiaomi is affecting the iPhone sales specifically. That is to say, I have not seen a study with data demonstrating that Xiaomi's rise is coming necessarily at the expense of Apple. Instead, it could very well be (and likely is given the evidence of rising Apple sales) coming at the expense of vendors like Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Windows Phones, which is noted to experience declining China sales , or other vendors. That Apple stock took a 5% beating earlier this week because of concerns that the company may have to raise the price of its iPhone in China, which may lead to decreased demand, is at least somewhat unreasonable when viewed with the lens that Chinese consumers are not necessarily price sensitive when it comes to luxury brands, especially products that are used in public. Chinese consumers are concerned about how others perceive them, and are concerned about brands. If Apple does put in a slight increase in price in the new September phones, Chinese consumers aren't likely to react negatively, and Apple's sales in the region are likely safe. Just look at how much they were willing to pay for the iPhone 6 when it first came out. The bears cling onto the yuan devaluation and potential price raises as a negative for Apple, but in the end, it is likely to be high growth as usual in the Chinese market for the coming quarters.
