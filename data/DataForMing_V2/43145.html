Why Microsoft's Cloud Is Likely To Maintain Its Strong Growth Momentum - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft's cloud was one of the segments that continued to do well. The cloud stacks up well against AWS in terms of margins. Azure makes up small part of Microsoft's overall cloud which can minimize the impact of price cuts in the future. Microsoft recently released its third-quarter fiscal 2015 report that exceeded most investors' expectations and caused a 10% pop in the shares. Indeed, Microsoft shares have gained more than 15% over the last five days alone, the company's best 5-day gain in a long time. One of the key highlights from that report was Microsoft's cloud, which once again posted splendid triple-digit growth - up 106% during the quarter. Investors have become accustomed to Microsoft's cloud growing almost effortlessly in triple-digits over the past two years or so. It brought in revenue of $1.575 billion on an annual run rate of $6.3 billion, placing it neck-to-neck with Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN ) AWS, which reported revenue of $1.57 billion . The big difference, however, is that AWS is more or less a pure IaaS and PaaS cloud, while Microsoft's commercial cloud combines Azure, Office 365 and Dynamics CRM Online. From the infographic, Azure has roughly 11% market share, versus 29% for AWS. By using AWS's revenue of $1.57 billion and the relative market shares of Azure versus AWS, we can work out that Azure brought in about $0.596 billion during the quarter - though the figure is probably a little higher, because what we have here are the market shares for fourth-quarter 2014, whereas what Microsoft reported were figures for first-quarter 2015 (Microsoft's third-quarter fiscal 2015). Azure has been growing at almost double the rate of AWS, which means the gap between the two is gradually closing, with Azure gaining market share and AWS losing it. And that brings me to the second part of my thesis. Microsoft's Cloud is Less Susceptible to Commoditization If the figures I have worked out above are any good (which I believe they are), then Azure constitutes just 38% of Microsoft's cloud. This is great news for investors, for a couple of reasons. The first and most important is that Microsoft's cloud is not as vulnerable to the vagaries of commoditization or price cuts as AWS is. ZDNet worked out AWS's operating margin in the nice infographic below. From the infographic above, AWS sports an operating margin of around 16.9%, and gross margin of around 70% as per Barron's . Microsoft's commercial cloud revenues are lumped in the '' Commercial Other category. The category finished with revenue of $2.76 billion. Microsoft explains that the Commercial Other category lumps together cloud revenues as well as premier support services and consulting services. The Commercial Other segment finished with a gross margin of 41%. The analysts, however, did not provide estimates for Dynamics CRM, another important element of the cloud. I estimate the gross margin of Dynamics CRM to be around 70-80%, based on gross margins of CRM companies such as Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM ). Regarding the revenue of Dynamics CRM, Gartner provided the following data late last year: Salesforce.com finished the year with revenue of $5.37 billion, which places Microsoft's CRM revenue around $0.57 billion per quarter, using the relative CRM market shares of the two companies. That, in turn, means that Office 365 brought in revenue of $0.409 million during the last quarter. Using these revenue figures for the 3 main elements of Microsoft's cloud, we can work out Microsoft's cloud gross margin, which clocks in at roughly 71.7%, a bit higher than the company's corporate gross margin of 67%. Barron's, however, said that Office 365's gross margin is likely to gradually rise and stabilize around the 70-80% range that is typical of SaaS companies - meaning that gross margin of the entire cloud is likely to gradually improve. Currently, AWS and Microsoft's clouds have very similar revenue and gross margins. But, Microsoft's cloud carries a big advantage over AWS in that it's far less likely to be affected by future price cuts such as the ones we witnessed last year. Azure is the segment that is likely to be negatively impacted by price cuts, since it has IaaS and PaaS components, and Azure constitutes just 38% of Microsoft's overall cloud revenue. Moreover, it already sports a better gross margin than AWS - 80% versus 70% - which is hardly surprising given how aggressive Amazon has been with AWS price cuts in the past. This gives Azure more room to wiggle. At the moment, it's not very likely that any of the cloud leaders will be willing to engage in cloud pricing wars, such as the ones we witnessed last year, anytime soon. I think these companies have figured that the cloud has really good growth runways, so there is really no need to cut prices to the bone. But when growth starts slowing down dramatically, you can expect that we will see another round of price cuts. Microsoft's Cloud is a Darling in the Enterprise Microsoft's cloud is currently the overwhelming favorite for enterprises. A survey done by Cowen analysts late last year revealed that close to 70% of organizations planned to use it over the next over the next 12-18 months - more than double the number for any of the other major cloud vendors. Microsoft's cloud is preferred by organizations mainly because of its sound hybrid strategy, its ease of connecting to other clouds, and the ease of shifting workloads from the cloud to the enterprise whenever the need arises. AWS does not have a clearly defined way that organizations can bring their cloud-based machines back in-house, which smacks of vendor lock-in. Moreover, Azure uses the same virtualization platform that companies use in datacenters. IaaS and PaaS clouds are expected to grow at 30% CAGR through 2018, compared to just 5% growth for corporate IT. But the cloud leaders such as Azure and AWS are likely to continue growing much faster than the overall market. Microsoft's cloud is likely to continue with its strong growth momentum as the company continues to transition to a cloud-based platform.
