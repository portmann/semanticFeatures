A Logical Reason Why Apple Will Use An Intel Modem - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Rumors indicate that the Intel XMM 7360 will go in a future iPhone model. After weighing the potential upside for both Intel and Apple, the rumors actually have legs. Qualcomm will be more dependent on emerging OEMs as a result, while Intel's mobile business is likely to avert losses as a result of Apple. Furthermore, Apple's iPhone gross margin will likely improve as a result of using the XMM 7360. This puts Qualcomm in a tenuous situation as its modem is its highest ASP product, and losing this business will reduce licensing revenue by 200 million-plus devices per fiscal year. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) might win a bit of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) business, based on a report from Apple Insider. Now when weighing rumors, I often think about the driving motivations that could cause a company to shift their strategy so drastically. Well in the case of Apple , it designs the vast majority of its own IP blocks, and quite frankly Apple licenses from Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) when it comes to the modem and RF transceiver and various other IP pertaining to connectivity. When looking at an iHS teardown of component costs, the modem and RF transceiver is more expensive than every other component, aside from the display. Hence, it's no surprise Apple wants to use Intel's modem as an alternative, as Intel needs to build some momentum behind its modem business and is likely to license out its IP at a lower rate than Qualcomm. We witnessed Intel's contra-revenue program last year and they do price aggressively. I'm pretty certain they'll price anywhere along a demand curve to stimulate demand. If we look very carefully at AnandTech's diagram, Intel will have a CAT 10 modem available roughly when Qualcomm has a CAT 11 modem. Qualcomm usually operates six months to a year ahead of Intel when it comes to release cadence. However, there's no real marginal value to the CAT 11 modem that Qualcomm is set to release because none of the carriers offer speeds up to 600MBps. As you can tell, the download rate maxes out at around 40.5 MBPS, well below the speed of Category 11, which indicates that carriers will need to figure out a way to boost bandwidth by investing more heavily into cell towers while looking for configuration that can further develop carrier aggregation technologies. To gain a better understanding of carrier aggregation, and the various standards they operate by, please refer to this report . So even if Apple were to go with an inferior modem in Intel's XMM 7360, it's likely that Apple iPhone owners won't notice any considerable difference in performance. Unless if you're operating on Google's Fiber network, or live in a country where 1GBps is common, advancements in modem technology won't have any considerable impact on the quality of data speed. Hence, Apple can cut costs a little by using an Intel modem over a Qualcomm modem as consumers will not feel the marginal difference in quality. Also, Intel is one of Apple's primary vendors. Unlike Qualcomm, Intel provides the CPUs for Apple's MacBook and iMac line-up. So it shouldn't surprise anyone that Intel has some negotiating leverage when compared to Qualcomm, which is why I think Qualcomm will lose a lot of Apple's business going forward. Furthermore, Apple's iPhone margins are likely to improve as a result of using Intel over Qualcomm. When looking at the earlier iHS figure, the wireless section represents around 15% of Apple's COGS. If Apple can reduce this cost by a full five percentage points, gross margins could improve by a percent or so, driving significant bottom line growth for Apple in future fiscal years. Therefore, investors have to consider these four outcomes: Apple iPhone margins have further room to expand in FY 2016. Intel's mobile business will reduce losses considerably on future iPhone volume. Qualcomm's IP-licensing business will become more dependent on devices in the Android ecosystem, making future financial results dependent on Samsung, LG and Chinese OEMs. Qualcomm's business could have difficulty with reporting top line growth as modems have the highest ASPs and margins. After taking into consideration the upside/downside, I think both Intel and Apple present a much better risk to reward than Qualcomm at the present moment. Despite these comparisons, Qualcomm's mobile business is still dominant in the low to mid-end as the company can cross license all the relevant IP for many emerging OEMs. Despite emerging OEMs, Apple is projected to ship 200 million-plus devices per year for the next couple years, so the loss of Apple to Intel will hit Qualcomm's top line and bottom line considerably. On the back of these developments, I'm lowering my optimism on Qualcomm from a buy to a hold, and continue to reiterate my buy recommendation on both Intel and Apple.
