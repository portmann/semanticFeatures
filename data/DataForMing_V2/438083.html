And sure, Peter Thiel has been a public supporter of a presidential candidate who takes a dim view of a free press and immigrants. But Peter Thiel is also a keyÂ figure over at Facebook, a concern that seeks to become a major force in the news business and whose CEO has been a vocal proponent of immigrants in America. Silicon Valley venture capitalist Peter Thiel will remain on Facebook’s board following a vote on Monday at the companyâ€™s annual shareholder meeting. After weeks of scrutiny following the revelation that he had secretly been funding lawsuits against online news company Gawker Media, Thiel received backing from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who has majority voting control at the social media company.Â  So, basically, Mark Zuckerberg said Thiel is staying and Thiel is staying. You can bang your head all you want but this makes total sense. Mark Zukerberg thought up a $320 billion idea in his dorm room, blustered through early amateur hour mistakes and an economic implosion to become the Millennial Steve Jobs and now spends a lot of his time on Oprah-like public self-improvement. He doesn’t know of “failure” of “concern.” You’re surprised that he stuck with one of his earliest allies because it might “look bad?” Well, think again because Mark Zuckerberg is Silicon Valley’s Honey Badger, and Honey Badger don’t give a f*ck. How did Zuckerberg address the decision to stick by Thiel in the face of Facebook’s mad grab at partnering with onlines news outlets that cover Donald Trump? Zuckerberg did not address Thielâ€™s re-election on Monday after shareholders did not ask him about the Facebook board member or his battle with Gawker in a 30-minute question-and-answer session. What are those outlets gonna do? Forgo Facebook’s audience (ie: everyone on earth) as a protest against a board member?Â Well, don’t be the first outlet to do that because Mark Honey Badgerberg will just smile and whisper “Bye, Felicia.” So you can all stand there with Denton and Jeff Bezos, looking shcked and appalled that Peter Thiel will remain on the board at Facebook, but all that proves is that you don’t know the Honey Badger.
