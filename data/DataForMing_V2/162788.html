Steven Spielberg Didn't Produce Enough Value For Disney - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Steven Spielberg and his DreamWorks production company may leave Disney. Shareholders should be happy about this since Disney already has constructed a valuable movie slate. Even though Spielberg is a great director, sometimes its a good business decision to not be in business with him if he doesn't bring enough to the table. It's been reported that Steven Spielberg's DreamWorks production outfit may not renew its distribution deal with Disney (NYSE: DIS ). Instead, Spielberg may head over to Comcast's (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) (NASDAQ: CMCSK ) Universal Pictures lot. It's not that the deal with Spielberg cost Disney a lot of money. But I always assumed it was simply a way for Disney to expose itself to distribution-only income to enhance studio profits without taking much risk. Only problem is, as some reports have mentioned, DreamWorks didn't really live up to its promise. Although The Help was very successful, it's difficult to remember any other film that made a similar impact. On the other hand, a little research shows that the company put out some misses, such as the Fright Night remake, and the big-budget disappointment Cowboys & Aliens. As most of us know by now, Disney has very consciously decided to concentrate on branded movie entertainment. Lucasfilm, Marvel, Pixar - no article about Disney is complete without mentioning those names. However, remember when Disney used to release films under its Touchstone Pictures trademark? These were mainstream one-shot pictures that were varied in terms of subject and genre. What About Bob?, Dead Poets Society, and Pretty Woman are three examples of the Touchstone film portfolio. Disney eventually decided that a better focus was necessary, thus all the superhero and CGI-cartoon product. Since something like Dead Poets Society can't really become a consumer products hit, CEO Bob Iger felt it was best to not make those kinds of films any longer (for the most part, of course; Disney will still make non-blockbuster/no-special-effects stuff like Million Dollar Arm and McFarland, USA). The media conglomerate also sold off its Miramax library back in 2010, further cementing Iger's movie-strategy thesis in the minds of shareholders and Wall Street analysts. Disney apparently couldn't stay away from its past Touchstone habit. Instead of fully funding those kinds of non-superhero pieces, why not simply distribute them for DreamWorks? This way, Spielberg and his executives would do the work and take on most of the risk. Even with some low-grossing releases, DreamWorks would surely deliver plenty of hits and make the relationship worthwhile. Unfortunately, even Spielberg can't guarantee a steady succession of high-achieving cinematic experiences. Iger would be best served by having Disney fully concentrate on maximizing the potential of Marvel/etc. Yet, many point out the value of a marquee name like that of the famous director. Sure, that's understandable; I'm not going to argue that Spielberg isn't a genius. He just doesn't seem to want to engage the big-brand strategy all the time. At least, it wasn't clear to me, as a Disney shareholder, that he wanted to make big money both for DreamWorks and for Disney. If he did, he would have approached the slate he delivered in a decidedly different way. As an example, he could have said to himself, "Let's create for DreamWorks and Disney the next Jurassic World, followed by the next Transformers." Is there any evidence he ever expressed such a thought? This article over at Variety describes how the relationship was basically a nonstarter from the beginning. It implies, to me, that this may have been more the idea of a previous studio executive than of Iger and the board. But, about that Touchstone habit - should Disney get back into it? I wonder. When you think about it, Disney used to release films like Scream through Miramax's Dimension label. There's a lot of low-budget horror films out there starting little franchises and merchandising opportunities that can be aimed at adults. Disney probably won't go that way, though. Instead, it will continue to study the science of franchise building and look for the next Frozen. The media concern does not a Spielberg, or any other big, expensive name. It only needs a great consumer products division, solid brand equity, and as many Star Wars announcements it can make without saturating the market. Disclosure: I am/we are long DIS.
