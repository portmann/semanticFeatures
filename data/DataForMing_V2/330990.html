Boeing Is Still One Step Ahead With Its Passenger Wide-Body Products - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Boeing delivery volume centered on Dreamliner deliveries. In a previous article I had a look at the order inflow for wide-body aircraft in 2015 for Boeing (NYSE: BA ) and Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSF ) and concluded that it was not possible to point out a clear winner for the passenger wide-body order battle. In this article I will have a look at the passenger wide-body deliveries in 2015. (Note: Freighter deliveries are left out in this article) Figure 1: Passenger wide-body order deliveries for Boeing and Airbus in 2015 (Source: AeroAnalysis.net ) Very Large Aircraft deliveries contribute much more to deliveries than they do to the order inflow Boeing's high delivery volume is centered on Boeing 787 deliveries, while Airbus deliveries are centered on the Airbus A330 Whereas Boeing has strong delivery volumes for the Boeing 777, deliveries for the Airbus A350 are expected to pick up pace this year In terms of units the lead clearly is for Boeing, having 60% more deliveries. One of the most important things that can be concluded is that in terms of units, Boeing is a few steps ahead in the passenger wide-body segment. However, it has to be pointed out that Airbus is planning on putting out four times as many Airbus A350s in 2016. So, this gap will likely become smaller in 2016. For the order battle, I don't pay as much attention to the value as I do for the deliveries. The reason for this is that orders that are placed now will roll out of the factory in years from now. On the other hand, the bulk of the cash comes in at the moment of delivery and revenue is being recognized at the moment the aircraft leaves the factory floors and is accepted by the customer. So the time aspect makes delivery a much more important aspect when looking at deliveries. The wide-body aircraft delivered by Boeing have a catalogue value of $63.1bn, after discounts the value is closer to $29.5bn. For Airbus the catalogue value is about $40.9bn and $17bn after discounts. The most important conclusion that can be drawn is that Boeing still has a lead in wide-body deliveries. Boeing gets out much more revenue from their wide-body deliveries than Airbus does. I expect this to be the case for the coming years, which makes Boeing a nice long term hold. On the other hand, the Airbus A350 deliveries should pick up pace and boost Airbus' financial performance while Boeing definitely is facing big challenges with an announced rate cut in 2017 for the Boeing 777. A fair conclusion would be that investors that look for value now hold on to their Boeing shares, while investors that are looking for strong growth buy Airbus. In the end, holding either of these aerospace giants in your portfolio should not hurt. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
