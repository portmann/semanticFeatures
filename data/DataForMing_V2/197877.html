Etsy Sellers should Consider Handmade at Amazon Here are the tools and resources that changed my financial life! It was only a matter of time before the big craft site, Etsy, got a competitor. Unfortunately for Â them, they got Amazon . Could this spell doom for Etsy and their sellers? Maybe, but let’s not focus on that now. Let’s focus on this big money making opportunity. Any successful business knows they have to find opportunities when they can and this might be a big one for those craft businesses. Etsy was developed to serve those small businesses building their own crafts. They created a thriving marketplace with over 21 million customers. It was a great way for a mom and pop shop to earn a living. Unfortunately, it seems things are changing and Amazon is waiting to jump on board with Handmade at Amazon ! Just as the name suggests, this is a new storefront on Amazon.com which allows craft sellers to provide their products in a handmade only area. While you can only get to it from Amazon.com , it still just for handcrafted items made by artisans. The big news is that Amazon has courted some of their sellers from Etsy. Right now, they have launched Handmade at Amazon with 5,000 craft makers. This will grow over time, but it provides Amazon customers with thousands of handmade goods. Since Amazon has awesome technology powering their site, they allow customers to easily find what they are looking for via filters on the Handmade page. The cool part is they even let you customize your order before it hits the artisan. This means you don’t have to check out, then send the merchant a note about the customization. You can do it right on Amazon. This makes the process quick and easy for those looking for that handmade touch! You can even get some products shipped to you via 2-day shipping if you’re an Amazon Prime member (not a member? Sign up for a free, 30-day trial ). This is not on all the products and especially those which offer customization. You just have to look on the product page to see if it qualifies for Prime shipping or you can even use a filter on the left side. If you’re interested in selling on Handmade at Amazon, then you should know what type of products they are offering at this time. Basically, it’s much of what Etsy offers, so if you’re an Etsy seller, then you might not have to change much. There are currently seven different categories you can choose from (either buying or selling) that are really basic craft categories. They are: At this time, there are nearly 99,000 products listed on Amazon’s Handmade page. That’s quite a bit and I’m sure that will grow more as more artisans jump on board. Can You Make Money Selling on Handmade at Amazon? I think the quick answer would be yes. You can certainly make money by selling on Amazon and this is a very fast growing niche. Just look at the popularity of Etsy! There are many sellers who make a full-time living making and selling their crafts on Etsy. Etsy has around 21 million active shoppersÂ in their base. This means you could have the potential of selling to that many with your crafts. Amazon has 280 million active shoppers. That’s quite the increase. The more eyes on your products could result in more sales. If you’re an Etsy seller, this might be a good opportunity to branch out and diversify your earnings. You should never keep all of your eggs in one basket and Amazon can really increase your earning potential. From a person who ran an e-commerce company, I can tell you I wouldn’t have reached the million dollar mark without Amazon . I sold products on their and it was epic. Just with the massive customer reach I could get, getting sales was easy. It was the order fulfillment which caused me to have problems (my own issues). I would recommend selling your items on Amazon. If you’re an Etsy seller, then I would encourage you to apply for Handmade at Amazon. This could be great to expand your business and made a name for yourself. If you want to get an invitation, then just go here . They are just rolling out the program, so apply and then wait to see if you can get in. You do have to meet their guidelines of handmade, but that shouldn’t be a problem for most Etsy sellers. Normally when you sell on Amazon, you have to pay a monthly fee of $40, but this is not going to happen (as of right now) on the handmade marketplace. They are waiving their monthly fees and just taking a cut/commission for every product you sell. You can list as many products as you want for free using Amazon’s easy listing tool. Handmade at Amazon charges 12% referral fee when products are sold. This includes payment processing, marketing, discounted shipping rates, and fraud protection. There is currently no monthly fee. Â If you have a website, then you can also push people to your store on Amazon and then join their associates program. You can earn a commission for every product you sell on top of the profit you already make. This can be a good way to reduce your costs and increase your profit margins. You can sign up for Amazon Associates here . Since I’m a huge fan of diversification , I think this might be a great idea for any Etsy seller. You can instantly get access to 10x more customers under the branding of Amazon. This is instant recognition. If you want to sell on both, why not sell on both (if you can handle the extra orders). This keeps your eggs in multiple baskets instead of just one. I'm a business owner, blogger, father, and husband. I used credit cards too much and found myself in over $50,000 in debt.
