The new photo and video order, which will use a similar algorithm to Facebookâ€™s, will be based on usersâ€™ relationship with the person posting and the timeliness of the post. â€œAs we begin, weâ€™re focusing on optimizing the order â€” all the posts will still be there, just in a different order,â€? Instagram says. For example, the company says, if a userâ€™s favorite musician posts a photo or video from his recent concert, that content will be waiting at the top of their feed no matter how many accounts they follow or what time zone they live in. â€œWeâ€™re going to take time to get this right and listen to your feedback along the way,â€? Instagram says. â€œYouâ€™ll see this new experience in the coming months.â€?
