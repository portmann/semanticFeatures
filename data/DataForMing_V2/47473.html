Apple: Here's Why The Stock Will Take Out $140 Before The End Of May - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha I won't speculate and say Apple has begun its buyback program. But you can. The 3.04% gain on Friday was Apple's largest percentage move since January. Plain and simple, the bulls are now in charge of Apple stock. After its monster quarter last week, even the bears have gotten quiet. There's a term for those still talking, it's called stupidity. Good luck guessing what Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) stock is going to do next. But I'll be surprised if these shares are not at $140 to $145 by the end of May. Yes, I said it. Note, I own Apple shares. And while I've been vocal about Apple's lack of generosity, the stock - on the other hand - remains the gift that keeps on giving . In that vein, Friday's 3% jump in Apple stock was Christmas, ending three straight days of horror. And investors have every reason to expect more. Apple stock closed Friday at $128.95, up 3.04%. If you're counting at home, the stock added another 0.08% in after hours, reaching $129.05. The stock moved on heavy volume, almost 60 million shares, or roughly 12% higher volume than Apple has generated in its three-month daily average. And both metrics are important psychological marks for a lot of reasons. Why? Not only does it put Apple stock back above its 50-day moving average, it now means Apple is only less than 1% away from $130, which - by my estimation - is going to serve as Apple's new floor in the second half of the year. And the high volume affirms the upward direction. Equally important is how Apple ended the week. Not only did Apple stock end a three-day losing streak, (its longest streak in four months), the bears were demolished in the process. No, this wasn't a short squeeze like we saw at various points of 2014, but it felt like it. Apple stock busted through its two-month trading range of $123.50 to $126. And the stock didn't look back. Note the 3.04% gain on Friday was Apple's largest percentage move since Jan. 29. I won't speculate and say Apple has begun its buyback program. But you can. I also recall that Apple - after than Jan. 29 move - was well on its way to its (then) 52-week high of $133.60 for a 13% surge in the next three weeks. There's a lot of similarities with January's move and what happened last week. Accordingly, investors should focus on where Apple stock is heading next. My best guess is $140 to $145. Set it aside for now and put it away, for now. The immediate move will be $134, which I expect to be reached by Wednesday. Unlike last week, there is no Fed news on the horizon that will keep Apple from reaching $134 this week. Plain and simple, the bulls are now in charge of Apple stock. Apple must first break $130 as it approaches its flat base buy point $133.60. If that number sound familiar, it should be. It's Apple's previous 52-week high (prior to April 28) and it's also an area of resistance for the stock. After its monster quarter last week, even the bears have gotten quiet. There's a term for those still talking, it's called stupidity. True, a lot of good news was baked into Apple's second quarter . And if you expected anything less than perfection from Apple ahead of the quarter, you were in the minority. Apple didn't disappoint. Last week, the tech giant garnered 13 more price target increases after its results were digested. Thank you Mr. Philip Elmer-DeWitt for staying on top this. These upgrades now put Apple stock at a median price target of $142.90, according to Fortune. And that's right in the middle of my target range. Not to mention, at 17 times earnings, Apple stock is perhaps the cheapest stock in the entire Dow Jones Industrial Average, given its $195 billion is cash, its size and the earnings/revenue growth it has produced and its projected to deliver in the years ahead. Given all of these factors, Apple stock should be owned, not traded. $140 to $145 is the next target. And everything is lining up for Apple to take out that range. Get on board or get the heck out of the way. Source: Apple: Here's Why The Stock Will Take Out $140 Before The End Of May Disclosure: The author is long AAPL.
