Apple Watch Is Not A Failure Because Of Fitbit - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Fitbit's Q4 sales were at a much lower price point. Apple Watch is generating much more revenues. One thing I never like is when I see an apples to oranges comparison. If you want to compare two products, they need to be extremely similar. Unfortunately, I keep seeing a lot of comparisons between the Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Watch and Fitbit (NYSE: FIT ), many of which are extremely misguided. Another article on this site recently detailed how the Apple Watch stumbled in Q4 2015 and Fitbit is the clear winner in wearables. This line of thinking is well off the mark. (Fitbit Blaze vs. Apple Watch via abcnews article) We don't quite know the exact sales numbers for the Apple Watch as the company is keeping them a secret for now. Once the product is a little more established, I'm sure we'll get some unit sales numbers. For now, let's take a look at what IDC reported for Q4 2015, detailed in the table below. SA contributor Bull & Bear Trading talked about how Fitbit took away market share from Apple during Q4. While that is true to a point if you look at pure unit shipments, it misrepresents the situation. Let's take a look at page 45 of Fitbit's 10-K filing for 2015. Fitbit reported an average selling price of $85 for the whole year, and the number was at $84 through the first three quarters of the year. So in Q4 2015, Fitbit averaged around $86 per device sold. However, the Apple Watch starting price was $349, with a number of models/pairs going for much higher. Even if we assume that the cheaper models represented a higher percentage of sales, Apple's average selling price was likely $400 or more. At that figure, Apple was generating almost 5 times as much revenue per device than Fitbit. Did Fitbit really win Q4 2015 then? Using the numbers from IDC and my ASPs above, Fitbit would be around $700 million in revenues and Apple Watch about $1.6 billion. Sure, Fitbit may sell twice as more units, but at around 5 times the price, Apple Watch generates more than twice as much revenue. In fact, Fitbit for the entire 2015 year only reported revenues of $1.86 billion, so the Apple Watch may have actually generated more revenues in about 3.5 months. Fitbit has been around since 2007 and didn't get to $2 billion in annual revenues last year. Based on IDC's yearly numbers the Apple Watch was close to $5 billion last year and the product didn't start selling until late April (and that was only select markets). The article I linked above goes on about how the new Fitbit Blaze is selling way better than the Apple Watch on Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ). Again, the Fitbit Blaze starts at $199, while the Apple Watch only after its recent price cut starts at $299. We're getting closer to an even comparison but we're not there yet. Additionally, the Blaze is a new product versus the Apple Watch which is basically a year old. Of course, Apple Watch sales are going to tail off a bit as consumers wait for the second edition to be launched. Had the Apple Watch launched in the past month or two, this would be a valid comparison, but again, we are comparing apples to oranges, no pun intended. So can we please stop with the invalid comparisons between Fitbit and the Apple Watch? Yes, Fitbit sells more units, but at a fraction of the price. Apple probably generated more Watch revenues in the last four months of 2015 than Fitbit did in the entire year. Additionally, comparing the brand new Blaze to the year old Watch is misleading. The Apple Watch is clearly winning in terms of revenues, so anyone telling you that Apple is a big loser here is quite mistaken.
