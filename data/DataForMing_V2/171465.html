Microsoft Buying AMD Makes No Sense - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) | Seeking Alpha Sep. 14, 2015 12:12 PM ET  |  About: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) , MSFT , Includes: INTC , NVDA , TSM by: Mark Hibben Rumors of a Microsoft acquisition of AMD sent AMD shares higher on September 11. Microsoft's experience with the Nokia purchase precludes an AMD purchase. As hopes for tangible financial progress fade, investors in "turnaround" stocks such as AMD (NASDAQ: AMD ) tend to subsist increasingly on rumors and speculation. The rumor on Friday that Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) was discussing buying AMD caused the stock to pop by greater than 8%. Given its recent experience with Nokia, Microsoft has undoubtedly lost its appetite for money losing hardware companies. It was only last quarter that Microsoft took an $8.4 billion charge to write off Nokia and cover restructuring costs. Even if the media and AMD investors have forgotten, I doubt that MS CEO Nadella has. Nokia provides a case study in how not to become vertically integrated. Buy a money losing business that is too large for its revenue stream in a business area (smartphones) that has already demonstrated a failed business strategy (adoption of Windows Phone). Then keep trudging along on the same failed path (more Windows phones), while cutting personnel. In the end, what Microsoft ended up with was . . . nothing. No successful product line, and not even talent or IP to justify the purchase. This is the meaning of the write down. As of Q2, Windows Phone market share stood at just 2.5%, down from 2.8% a year ago, according to Gartner . The only thing the Nokia purchase accomplished was that it spared Steve Ballmer the embarrassment of Nokia abandoning the Windows Phone platform for Android back in 2013. No such motivation exists for Satya Nadella for buying AMD. Microsoft has not staked a corporate strategy on any AMD partnership outside of buying AMD semi-custom processors for XBox One. XBox platform revenue only represented $860 million out of Microsoft's $22.2 billion in the June quarter. If the Nokia experience isn't enough to discourage Microsoft from other such ventures, there is the ever weakening market and financial position of AMD itself. AMD has continued to lose market share to both Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) and its graphics rival Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ). The net result has been a steep y/y decline of 54% in revenue in its Computing and Graphics Segment to $379 million in the June quarter and an operating loss of $147 million. And of course, no purchase of AMD would be complete without AMD's substantial $2.034 billion in debt, which consumes most of AMD's total assets of $3.38 billion. AMD's cash position also continues to erode, dropping from $10.4 billion last December to $829 million in June. Oh well, AMD can always borrow more money. There is some near term and longer term hope for AMD. In the short term, there is the Carrizo line of systems on chip ((SOCs)) that AMD insists on calling Accelerated Processing Units ((APUs)). These combine substantial AMD Radeon graphics as well as 64 bit Intel compatible CPU cores. Carrizo is intended to target the most important PC market, laptops, and was announced with great fanfare in June. Oddly, I can't find much in the way of test data for Carrizo notebooks, in order to compare Carrizo with Intel's recently announced Skylake series of Core processors. There's some early benchmarking of a Carrizo-L notebook with Intel's previous gen Broadwell Core i3, where the i3 demonstrates superior performance. All I've found on AMD's top of the line Carrizo part (the FX-8800P) is what appears to be a promo video showing that the Carrizo beats Broadwell. The real question is how Carrizo stacks up against Skylake, and on that point, I can only offer an educated guess. Based on what Intel released at their IDF in San Francisco in August, Skylake will probably close the gap in graphics performance with Carrizo. Intel is claiming roughly a 40% improvement in graphics performance compared to Broadwell, and that should be enough to equal Carrizo. Intel has been building in successively more capable graphics in each generation of Core processor, and with Skylake, Intel has evolved a flexible graphics architecture that allows Intel to add "slices" of graphics processing units in order to increasing processing power. I'll reserve final judgment until I see test data from both Skylake and Carrizo. Skylake achieving performance parity in graphics probably dooms Carrizo to also ran status. Intel has the advantage of its 14 nm process vs. 28 nm for Carrizo. The process advantage is really starting to take its toll on AMD's market share. For general purpose computing, I can't see Microsoft being willing to bet on AMD, and clearly, Surface 3 and Surface Pro 3 reflect that. In the longer term, AMD has a new much faster CPU core architecture, Zen, and the promise of fabrication on a 14 nm scale FinFET process by either TSMC (NYSE: TSM ) or Global Foundries. As I've discussed previously, this may make AMD's chips more compelling for ultralight form factor notebooks, and even attract the interest of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL )as a customer. Does the promise of Zen make AMD more attractive as an acquisition target? I doubt that it does for Microsoft. The whole semiconductor industry is in the throws of a paradigm shift away from commodity processors fabricated by large scale chip producers such as Intel and AMD to custom SOCs produced by companies such as Apple. This was initially driven by the need for highly integrated mobile devices, but the custom paradigm has been expanding to swallow up ever larger shares of the personal computing market. The industry has been adapting to the paradigm shift in a number of ways. AMD's own semicustom business represents an adaptation of sorts. AMD in effect embraces the custom SOC paradigm and becomes a custom semiconductor house for hire. AMD's main problem here has been a lack of presence in the mobile ARM device world. There just hasn't been that much demand for semicustom Intel compatible chips. The other way the industry has been adapting is through consolidation. Here Intel clearly intends to be the Last Semiconductor Company Standing. Microsoft needs semicustom capability for its Intel architecture mobile devices, tablets and phones, but it can expect to get that from Intel. After Microsoft's failed ventures with ARM architecture devices such as Nokia phones and Windows RT tablets, Microsoft has been driven back into the arms of Intel. If Nadella has any sense, that's where Microsoft will stay. Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
