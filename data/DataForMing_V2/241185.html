Starboard asks Yahoo to drop Alibaba stake spinoff plans | Reuters Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer speaks during her keynote address at the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada January 7, 2014. Activist investor Starboard Value LP asked Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) to drop plans to sell its stake in Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd (BABA.N), citing a significant risk of taxes on the sale. Starboard, which said it is a "significant shareholder" in Yahoo, instead urged the company to sell its core search and display advertising businesses, where growth has been tepid. Yahoo's current net cash holding and the funds raised from a sale of the ad business could be returned to shareholders through buybacks and dividends, Starboard said in a letter it sent Yahoo on Thursday. Starboard said it made the letter public as its efforts to talk with Yahoo privately for the past year had not yielded positive results. Yahoo, whose shares were up 0.8 percent premarket on Thursday, was not immediately available for comment. Alibaba was up 0.5 percent. The hedge fund had supported the sale of Yahoo's stake in Alibaba, worth more than $20 billion, before the U.S. Internal Revenue Service in September denied a request for a private letter ruling on whether the spinoff would be tax free. Yahoo has said it expects to close the stake sale in the current quarter. If the IRS denies the tax-free status later, Yahoo's shareholders may have to pay about $9 billion in taxes. "If you stay on the current path, we believe the potential penalty for being wrong is just too great, and the potential reward for being right is not materially better than the other alternative," Starboard's managing member, Jeffrey Smith, wrote.
