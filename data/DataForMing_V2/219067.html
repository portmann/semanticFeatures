The Importance Of Asia In Light Of Apple's Q4 Results - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Other Asian countries apart from just China showing great growth for Apple. Growing Asian economies are a reason to remain bullish on Apple. IoS gaining market share in Asia against Android. Retail growth in Asia set to continue and outpace world growth. 2015 Q4 results for Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) shed an interesting light on the whole of Asia, not just China. I first wrote about Apple in China in September 2014 under the heading "Why Asia is Vital For The Future Of Apple." Since then plenty of analysts and correspondents have weighed in on the importance of China for Apple. So I will not reprise what everyone is now writing about China. Subsequently I wrote about the potential of India for Apple in "Will India Be The Next Domino To Fall For Apple." In China, Q3 2015 sales for the iPhone rose 87% year-on-year and in Q4 2015 they have risen a startling 120%, as CEO Tim Cook described in the conference call . Revenues there were up 99% year-over-year to hit US$12.5 billion (out of a total worldwide for the company of US$51.5 billion). Those who have written that Apple will be impacted badly by the slowdown in China are mistaken. They fail to understand the strong consumer demand picture in the country as Cook himself pointed out in the conference call. They also fail to understand the continuing long-term growth of the middle class there. In China the smartphone market in total was actually down slightly, so as Cook stated : "So we've been able to grow without the market growing. iPhone 6 was the number one selling smartphone in mainland China last quarter, and iPhone 6 Plus was number three." The developer community there for IoS was the fastest-growing of anywhere in the world, and other Apple products continue to grow in China. Apple Music will be launched in China in the coming quarter, along with iTunes Movies and iBooks. One should not see Asia as one monolithic body, and markets are very different to each other from country to country. However, there is plenty more promise for Apple in countries throughout Asia in addition to China, on which analysts have perhaps over-focused. The Q4 2015 results showed revenue growth in the mature (for Apple) market of Japan up 9% to US$3.9 billion. Revenues in the Rest of Asia Pacific (that is, excluding Greater China and Japan) were up 27% to US$2.7 billion. Asia's population is 4.4 billion people, or still a mighty 1.8 billion if you exclude China and India. Allied to the large population, a young demographic and healthy long-term growth rates seem certain to make Asia the biggest revenue region for Apple by next year. Early skeptics about Apple in China emphasized the problem of affordability of the iPhone there, but they were of course mistaken. As this link shows, the 6S is of course expensive there. On average incomes, it takes someone 19 days pay to afford an iPhone 6S, as compared to four days in the US or five days in Japan. In India it would take 54 days, so affordability is a problem there. However it's not an insuperable problem. Apple's iconic status means that in market after market consumers buy iPhones even though they would appear to be unaffordable products in that market by standard metrics. Additionally, in most of Asia there is great income inequality. So even in a country with a low average income, there are still plenty of lovers of conspicuous consumption who want to buy expensive branded goods. A key metric for Apple's breakthrough in Asia over the last couple of years was the shift to a larger format phone, as the graph below illustrates. In Asia there is far greater demand for the larger format product than there is elsewhere in the world, and Tim Cook and his team were savvy enough to understand this and act upon it. The country of 1.2 billion people currently has 350 million active Internet users , of which 60% access by mobile. These 210 million mobile users are forecast to become 314 million mobile users by 2017. By that year India is forecast to be the second-largest smartphone market in the world. A problem for Apple in India has been the high cost of the iPhone there due primarily to high import taxes. This is one reason why the older iPhone models (4S, 5C and 5S) are the introductory iPhone of choice for many consumers in the country. In the Q3 2015 report, Apple had stated that iPhone sales in India increased 93% so it is undoubtedly a fast-growing market for Apple, but from a small base. It's thought the company was aiming for sales of 2 million iPhones in the fiscal year ending September 2015. This would represent a 100% increase on the previous year, but only 2% of the total market. In the Q4 2015 conference call, Tim Cook singled out India as a market where the company had high growth, without going into specifics. Apple's close partner in China, Foxconn, is planning to build 20 factories and data centers in India by 2020 at a cost of US$5 billion. It's not confirmed yet as to what Foxconn plans to do with all this capacity but it is very likely that assembling products for Apple is foremost in their planning for such a large financial investment. Apple's large-scale manufacturing in China has helped lead to a symbiotic relationship of mutual interests with the Chinese Authorities, and the same could become true for India. Apple's recent retail investments in India show Tim Cook's seriousness about the market as a long-term target. They have three premium re-sellers in the country: Redington, Ingram and BrightStar. A fourth distributor, Optiemus, has recently been appointed. The company is now partnering with giant Indian conglomerate Tata to open Apple stores in Mumbai and Bangalore, with a "store-within-a-store" retail concept. One problem for Apple is that Indian Government regulations do not allow for foreign companies to have their own wholly-owned retail outlets. This makes it difficult for Apple to replicate its special Apple Store retail experience there. The level of corruption at every level of society also poses problems for U.S. corporations wanting to invest in the country. A short-term driver was the announcement that Apple Watch was being launched in India on November 6th. If this is successful, then it will show those people mistaken who consider expensive products will not sell well in this country. It also will help Apple to build up its "ecosystem" of products which is vital to success. Opinion is divided on how well the Apple Watch is selling worldwide. However, according to Switzerland's Federal Customs Administration Swiss watch exports have been substantially down for the past three months. Indications are that the Apple Watch is at least partly responsible for this, and Swiss watch sales have been especially hit in Asia. Quite surprisingly Apple has made tremendous inroads into the South Korean market of 50 million consumers in the past couple of years. This strikes right at the heart of arch rivals Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) and LG. The 6S continued this breakneck market penetration. The country's three main cellphone carriers (SK telecom, KT and LG Uplus) sold out as fast as their websites could handle orders in the October launch. Samsung had to cut the prices of its Galaxy S6 to compete. It also is rushing out what they call a "pink gold" finish to cope with demand for Apple's new "rose gold" finish which is proving very popular with Asian consumers. This market shows once again that Apple can strike at the heart of its closest competitors in market after market. As the Q4 2015 revenue growth rate of 27% shows, wherever you look in Asia, Apple is flourishing. This applies to the huge quite undeveloped country of Indonesia (245 million people). It applies to the poor but fast-growing and well educated Philippines (98 million). It applies to the small (5 million people) but affluent (higher GDP per head than the US) market of Singapore. Figures from IDC for instance show that in the second quarter of the year in Singapore, Apple was the market leader. It accounted for 38% of the 1.1 million smartphones shipped into the country in that quarter. Samsung, for a long time the market leader in S-E Asia, had 26% of the market. Japan's 127 million consumers can't get enough of Apple products. This is despite the fact that it's the home of the excellent Xperia range from Sony (NYSE: SNE ) and had a well-established and unique mobile market before the arrival of the iPhone. In the July earnings call Tim Cook had particularly called out Japan as a market where Apple had grown at five times the market growth. The launch of the iPhone 6S in Japan has reportedly seen less demand than the iPhone 6. This might be a reflection of a mature market for the product there, but revenues in Japan still rose a healthy 9% in Q4 2015. Figures from Kantar for the three months up to late August reinforce the very promising picture for Apple throughout Asia. It should be noted these figures were for a period just before the launch of the new iPhone 6S model. Yet around the region the figures showed IoS gaining market share from Android. One stand-out country was Australia, where Kantar estimated the 37.8% market share to be the highest of any country in the world. Australia has now overtaken Japan's 33.7% market share. By comparison, market share in the U.S. is at 28.4%. With an eye to this region in the conference call Cook pointed out: Of Apple's 456 stores worldwide, only 10% are in Asia/Australasia. This is despite the fact that, according to a break-down of turnover, after Q3 2015, Asia had accounted for 38.5% of company turnover. This figure is probably higher now. The busiest store in the world is said to be the one in Shanghai. It's well documented that Tim Cook plans to increase the number of stores in China from the current 25 (as updated by Cook in the Q4 2015 analysts call) to 40 by next year. It will be interesting to see if the retail presence is ramped up elsewhere in Asia. As the graph from the Economist Intelligence Unit below shows, Asia (and in particular India) is the place to be for retail growth in coming years: This retail growth will be especially useful for the Apple Watch, which is very much a retail experience. Luxury watches in Asia are a big market, with growth rates over the past few years much higher than in Europe or North America. After all the excitement over the China potential for Apple, which analysts were originally slow to understand, they are being similarly slow to understand the potential of the rest of Asia. Apple has proved in China that it can sell high-priced items to aspiring Asian consumers. The trend is replicating itself throughout the Asian continent. This will be buoyed by better growth rates than elsewhere in the world and a good demographic. The Q4 2015 figures show that Apple's growth in China is startling, but also that growth across the Asia region is higher than anywhere else in the world.
