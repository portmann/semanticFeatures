ETF Hub Jan 15 2016, 19:17 ET | About: Apple Inc. (AAPL) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor "The iAd App Network will be discontinued as of June 30, 2016," Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) states on its developer site. "Although we are no longer accepting new apps into the network, advertising campaigns may continue to run and you can still earn advertising revenue until June 30." The App Network, one part of the iAd platform, allows developers to promote their App Store apps across iAd's publisher network The news follows a BuzzFeed report stating Apple plans to phase out iAd's sales force, while allowing publishers to directly sell ads through a programmatic (automated) ad-buying platform and keep 100% of generated revenue. BuzzFeed suggested the move could be a negative for The Rubicon Project (NYSE: RUBI ) and other ad tech firms Apple has partnered with to enable programmatic iAd buys. iAd, launched in 2010, has served ads on iOS devices, Macs, and PCs. Tim Cook has suggested Apple's main goal with the platform is to help developers make money, rather than create a major new revenue source. The business has faced stiff competition from rivals such as Google's AdMob unit and Facebook's Audience Network. Update: Some other Apple news: As of Jan. 29, Apple will no longer support free/ad-supported iTunes Radio. Ad-free stations will be provided via Apple Music. There's no indication yet that iTunes Match's support for ad-free iTunes Radio will be going away. Great is all I can say. More users can TRUST Apple. The insidious use of profiling which Google, Facebook and other use to feed targeted ads is one of the most offensive parts of the internet.  I'm pleased Apple is differentiating itself and not proceeding to compete by developing and using iAd. "Apple plans to phase out iAd's sales force, while allowing publishers to directly sell ads through a programmatic (automated) ad-buying platform and keep 100% of generated revenue." I agree, 100%, on top of that i understand the adv is necessary to make some money, but it so annoying when you just want to chill and browse with no distraction, cuff cuff youtube. actually alot of them do it aswell and at this point i think its overdone posting so many ads. good job apple let others do the dirty work. side note all the short miniads kinda affect our younger generation and possibly lower their attention, i am no scientist but just food for thought iAds had by far more ad impression counts than all of Google. Yet.... they made only modicum of income off them. It's about time Apple just went to publishers straight and stops trying to compete on their closed garden walled network. Think of it this way; Google makes their money by directly getting paid from publishers..... no matter where the ad is seen. That's in App or just on the Web. So what publishers did with Apple, was because it was on their own managed network, they put the ads right in with the content. So although they got impression counts, Apple wasn't getting paid for them. Meanwhile Apple's users were getting deluged with ads and Apple wasn't getting paid for it. Google still owns the largest profit margins on Advertising and that won't even be affected by iAds staying on or getting killed. AND.... Google has been acknowledged as more concerned with privacy and advocacy in government than Apple or Microsoft both have. They anonymize their data and the others sell you out all the time!!! ......that includes Apple!!! That's a good point.  I've actually tried some searches with Bing lately because there are so many sales sites getting returned on Google searches.  You have to scroll down and down to get to something along the line of what you're looking for.  It sure didn't used to be that way.  In the end, I think it would have hurt Apple more than they would have gained in revenue. what sales ads are you even talking about? i havent seen that many if at all. bing search? hahahaha good one. i left apple because of their nazi level control of the OS. cant choose default apps like the browser. cant change default search. apple has been selling user data for years. data is being collected on ios just as much as android, if not more. You can change the search engine in Settings>Safari.  You can choose between Google, Yahoo, Bing and Duck Duck Go.  And, get back on your meds, please. This choice is congruent with Apple's most recent stances concerning privacy.  The CES show had multiple HomeKit products on display.  The reported main concern that was discussed, pertaining to these Internet of Things products, is consumer paranoia about security.  Apple is in the sweet spot in this regard.  They have been highly critical of data mining and government agencies wanting to play Big Brother.  In addition they have made the security of the fingerprint sensor available to developers.  This consistency plays right into being the leader in the race to become the interface standard for consumer home device deployment. dude apple is the one mining data. they talk alot of game but the devs on the ios platforms love it because people have the illusion that it is safe. it is not. apple has already given the chinese a look at apple's code, not to mention probably a backdoor. google is the only one that cares about privacy from others because google doesnt want other people to have you data but them. @thehash: "apple has already given the chinese a look at apple's code, not to mention probably a backdoor. google is the only one that cares about privacy from others because google doesnt want other people to have you data but them." looks like google just laid the smackdown on apples candy arse. even more bad news for the marketing company we call apple. google is just killing it in android. Obviously you're an android lover and can't comprehend that Apple doesn't have to or want to delve into every aspect of your personal life to try to generate money. Apple has a much simpler model. Provide quality products and services and let the customer decide whether they want it. Enjoy your info commercials/ search engine. I prefer Apple's way. man on point. glad to know there are others like me who are aware enough to realize this simple rule i.e freedom to browse that is our right. Tried to get people to understand this company was broken... Can lead a horse to water, but you can't make a fool drink it. Laughing all the way to the bank! Keep pumping you guys, I am long its stock for a while, bought 500 shares this morning at 95.81. Thanks.
