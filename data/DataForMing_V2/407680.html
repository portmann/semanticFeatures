Boeing's 787 In The News | Seeking Alpha Judging by the news , you might think Boeing (NYSE: BA ) is in big trouble. Chief among the concerns is Boeing's use of 1,300 orders as its block accounting number for costs. With 1,154 sales through April, and slowing sales, there is a view that Boeing may never recover its costs on the 787. It is true that sales have slowed in the past 24 months. But then sales for all commercial aircraft have slowed, not just 787 sales. Airbus and Boeing have had some blockbuster years recently. They both have a seven year backlog on single aisle aircraft. In addition to the regular business cycle, the massive drop in oil prices have enabled airlines to keep older fleets in operation a bit longer. New aircraft on order have seen deliver dates slide to the right - but only for some airlines. For example, Southwest is accelerating its first 737MAX delivery because Boeing is able to get this done sooner. Back to the 787. Take a look at this chart. The current backlog peaked in 2013. That is not because orders tapered off. Orders grew from 2014 and 2015. The 2013 order spike occurred because Boeing had offered the latest model of the 787, the -10. There were a lot of orders for that new model. The real driver in decreasing the backlog is Boeing's expanding production capabilities. With two factories delivering 787s, Boeing should be able to push out 120 aircraft per year. In fact in 2015 Boeing delivered 135 of the 787. The Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSY ) A330 is the 787's primary competitor. It is cheaper and now has been offered in a "neo" version. Looking at the equivalent chart we see the following. The Airbus A330 (all models except freighter) backlog is about a quarter that of the Boeing 787's. It is true that the 787 delays helped Airbus sell a lot of A330s. But now Boeing has production humming. Boeing faces brutal pricing competition from the cheaper, but also lower-tech A330. Airbus decision to create an A330neo was a smart move to crimp pricing on the 787. So is it as bad as the news suggests? We'd say no and here is why. The concerns people have expressed about the 787 come down to these issues: 路 Boeing cannot recoup $30bn invested in the 787. o This is a fair point. Boeing says it can recover the investment which is based on a block of 1,300 aircraft. We think Boeing will sell many more 787s and will exceed the 1,300 number. Plus this assumption does not include the "lessons learned" savings Boeing will recoup as R&D savings on other new programs yet to be developed. o As we can see in the chart above, orders wax and wane with the business cycle. A current slowdown means nothing. The next up cycle is coming, just as the next downturn is also coming. The 787 program is a long way from sales drying up. 路 Low fuel prices make the 787 less attractive. o Low fuel prices are a recent event, and also subject to market variances. We do not think oil prices are going to go as high as they were two years ago for a long time. But the 787 story is about much more than low fuel burn. The aircraft has unique range and payload capabilities. 路 Airlines have not been attracted by the 787's "hub busting" capabilities. o This is only partly true. There are exceptions - British Airways, ANA and Japan Airlines have all been doing this very successfully and opened new markets in the US using the 787. Ethiopian is going that way now, with its first nonstop service the US. o Another operator exploiting the unique range/payload capabilities of the 787 is Thomson/TUI, which is replacing 767s with 787s. As 787 operators become more experienced with the aircraft, they will push it to its limits - as United is doing serving secondary markets in China. Without the 787, United could not do this. o Norwegian is disrupting markets by using the 787 as the lowest cost competitor in its markets and lowering yields for competitors. Which is why the US airline industry is trying to stop Norwegian's growth. The 787 is Norwegian's trump card. o Every success by a 787 operator will force a competitor flying a less capable aircraft to rethink their strategy. It may even force Airbus to further discount their A330 even as Boeing can start to drive up its 787 pricing as operators see the benefits the 787 brings. 路 Airlines that wanted the 787 have already bought the aircraft. o This is plainly an exaggeration. The 787 was developed to replace the 767. There were 887 767s still in operation as of the end of 1Q16. Many, and perhaps most, will eventually be replaced by 787s. When one adds the, say, 500 of these 767s to the 1,154 ordered to date, the total of 1,654 is comfortably over the 1,300 block in place today. Airlines have not finished buying the 787 by any stretch of the imagination.
