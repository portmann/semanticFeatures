Facebook said on Wednesday that "Reactions", an extension of the "Like" button, has now been rolled out worldwide. The social network launched a pilot of "Reactions" - which allows users to select from seven emotions including "Angry", "Sad" and "Wow" - in Ireland and Spain in October. In a video accompanying a blog post, the five new buttons appear as animated emoticons that pop up when the "Like" button is held down on mobile devices. The buttons appear on desktops when users hover over the "Like" button. The "Yay" emoticon, which was present in the pilot launch, was not seen in Wednesday's video.

Facebook said "Reactions" would have the same impact on ad delivery as "likes".
