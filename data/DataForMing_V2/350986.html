Disney Shanghai sells out first-day tickets, books hotels - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Mar 28 2016, 13:16 ET | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor It doesn't open until June 16, but first-day tickets to the new Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS ) theme park in Shanghai are sold out . Those tickets were gone within hours of going on sale at midnight. And as of noon, rooms were fully booked at Shanghai Disney Resort's two on-site hotels for the first two weeks after opening. Park tickets for June 17-Sept. 30 are available and range from 370 yuan (non-peak, about $57) to 499 yuan (peak, about $77). Non-peak tickets cost about 20% less than at Hong Kong Disneyland, though the Shanghai park is three times the size. Revenue is likely to range from 24B yuan to 40B yuan a year ($3.7B-$6.2B/year), with up to 50M visitors each year. Shanghai Disney would be a huge success, but Disney Hong Kong would be affected by the declining mainland visitors going to Hong Kong, which is already happening. There are more than enough Chinese to support two Disney theme parks. The USA has two parks for 320 MM people. China has two parks and 1.36 B people, over four times the US population. Of course there are significant economic and cultural differences between the two countries, but Disney has proven itself successful in exporting its content, characters and "Magic" across international borders.  No need to worry in the long-term about cannibalism of the Hong Kong park by the new Shanghai park. Shang Hai has a populace of 331 million within a three hour travel radius, wish I was that close to either USA park.
