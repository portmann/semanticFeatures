Time To Buy VirnetX Again - VirnetX Holding Corporation (NYSEMKT:VHC) | Seeking Alpha Virnetx won a convincing infringement victory over Apple. All Apple IOS devices were found to infringe Virnetx's patents. In the February trial, Virnetx (NYSEMKT: VHC ) won a overwhelming victory over Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). First, the jury awarded VHC $334,908,773.73 for the remanded damages portion of the previous trial. This damage award is for the infringement for VPN on Demand (VPNoD). The jury additionally found that changes made by Apple to work around VHC's patents still infringing those patents. The jury also found that iMessage and FaceTime also infringe VHC's patents and are still infringe those patents with the latest version of IOS. For this infringement the jury awarded an additional $290,725,067.31 for the additional products that infringe VHC's patents. An additional very important finding of the jury was that the infringement was "willful". The verdict of willfulness is very important as it opens Apple for additional penalties including up to triple damages and it increases the likely hood that Apple will have to pay VHC's attorney's fees. What happens next? On May 25th there will be a post trial hearing on post trial motions from both parties. The court has also ordered both parties to attend mediation by May 18th. Virnetx has filed a post trial briefing as required by the court. Virnetx's filing asks for "Substantial Enhancement" of damages, and for the court to find that this is an "Exceptional Case" and award attorneys' fees. Most importantly Virnetx is requesting a permanent injunction on the infringing components of Apple's products. This is the request of most importance as this will force Apple to the bargaining table if granted. If issued Apple would have to remove VPNoD, iMessage and FaceTime from new products shipped. As explained above, the irreparable harm caused by Apple's infringement can only be rectified by removing the patented technology form the accused products. Apple does not dispute that it has no non-infringing alternatives. 2/2/2016 Trial Tr. (Apple) at 85:6-7 ("We did not rely on non-infringing alternatives in our case."); 1/28/2-16 Trial Tr. (Bench Conf.) at 123:23-124:6. Thus, this Court may appropriately conclude that the narrowest injunction necessary to afford VirnetX complete relief is to require Apple to altogether remove the infringing Facetime, iMessage, and always-mode VPN On Demand features from its devices. Nonetheless, as explained more fully in the attached proposed judgment, VirnetX requests only that the Court remove the infringing functionality of these features for devices that have not been accounted for in a damages award. Apple may do so by implementing a noninfringing alternative such as relaying Facetime calls. To be clear, VirnetX is not seeking to prohibit Apple from selling iPhones, or to require Apple to disable Facetime and iMessage on all of its devices. VirnetX merely requests that the Court order Apple to remove the patented technology from the Facetime, iMessage, and VPN On Demand features for devices that it sells in the future. (From Virnetx's filing) Why should you consider investing in Virnetx now? Let's do some simple computations on Virnetx's potential value when they begin receiving royalties on a regular basis. My simple assumptions are the following: Apple sold 306m units in 2015, 1/3 are US sales or 102m The royalty rate is what the jury awarded, $1.41 / unit Virnetx earnings would therefore be $2.48 / share Using a conservative price/earnings ratio of 10 would value VHC at 24.80 / share. With a current pps of under $5.00, there is significant upside potential. This does not include the lump sum payment for the previous infringement. With a windfall of approximately $600,000,000 the pps could go much higher. The real question now is how quickly will VHC's stock price appreciate? When will VHC begin receiving an income stream from the awarded royalties? There are several ways to the finish line. The first and quickest way to the finish line would be an injunction issued against Apple using Virnetx's patents in Apple's products. This injunction could be ordered as soon as the May 25th hearing. Apple cannot support their customer base with the previously tried work around with the quality their customers expect. Their previous attempt caused over 500,000 complaints as discussed in my previous article. It is highly likely that Apple would enter serious negotiations on licensing. Should this happen, we could see a settlement soon after the injunction is approved. If an injunction is not issued, what next. Apple appeals would be next. This trial was a combination of two different trials, one to settle the damages for the infringement decided in the previous trial and remanded by the CAFC to the district court and an additional trial to determine if iMessage and FaceTime infringe Virnetx patents. The judge could split the ruling into two sections one relative to the remanded damages from the first trial and the second on the finding of infringement of iMessage and FaceTime. The advantage of this would that he CAFC could rule quickly on the remanded portion as Virnetx's lawyers followed very carefully the outline given by the CAFC for acceptable approaches to calculate damages. With an award on the previous remanded damages and ongoing royalties from that portion, there would be a significant income while the CAFC decides the remainder of the case.
