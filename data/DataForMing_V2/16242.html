Why Apple's Slow Response To Disruptive Streaming Music Market Matters - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple is once again slow to respond to a market it competes in. The company appears to be falling behind as a market leader in streaming TV and music. This won't matter in the short term, but over time it could cause problems from slower sales of its physical products. Recently I wrote about the fact that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) TV is struggling to play catch-up with the emerging over-the-top TV market, as competitors have quickly released content bundles that have left Apple scrambling to put together its own package in order to compete in the market. Now the same is happening in the music streaming business, as Spotify and others have quickly created a streaming music market that has resulted in Apple iTunes being increasingly considered yesterday's way of consuming music. With iTunes, music is consumed with individual downloads to devices, while the music streaming business primarily uses a subscription model. For now the music business won't have much of an impact on Apple's top and bottom line either way, but over time the threat is if it is no longer considered a market leader in a number of categories it competes in, which means consumers could choose not only other services, but more importantly, other devices to consume content with. It's already having an impact on its bargaining power, as it recently was refused a request during negotiations with the music industry to lower its licensing costs, as the New York Times reported . That suggests Apple no longer has the negotiating strength it has had in the past; that means in the area of music streaming, it won't have a competitive edge in pricing, unless it decides to lose money to scale its streaming business out, while its smaller competitors are forced to lower prices in order to compete. As almost everyone reading this knows, Apple has been considered a market leader for years, and its loyal customer base would wait for the latest offering from Apple in a specific category because they believed it would be the best, and of course had a personal identification with the product. With a new generation having some buying power, that can no longer be an assumption investors can count on, as younger people are carving out their own market by identifying with products and services outside of Apple. That's what is happening in the streaming music market, as they have gravitated towards Spotify, Rhapsody, and others, abandoning the download model offered by iTunes. To get an idea of how quickly the music market is changing, in 2014 the number of downloads generated $2.6 billion in sales, a decline of 8.5 percent, while music streaming services accounted for revenue of $1.87 billion. By the end of 2015, my thought is music downloads and streaming will be very similar in outcomes, and in 2016 streaming will overtake download revenue permanently. Even though the music and TV content industries are different, it is instructive to note that Apple seems to be losing some of its former bargaining power in these markets, even though it did win a temporary exclusive deal to stream HBO Go when it releases a streaming TV bundle; probably some time in the latter part of 2015. The reason for its weakening position is the fact it has competitors that are leading these markets while it attempts to catch up with them and be considered relevant by a new generation of consumers ... at least in the case of music. What this all means is the days of Apple being the dominant player in music it has been in the past is over, and it may never be dominant in the streaming TV bundle market. Considering that free iTunes Radio has also been a failure, Apple is having difficulty on the streaming content side across the board. To me these means music and TV content producers no longer consider Apple to be the force it had been in the past, and that means it'll have to battle hard to differentiate and win the types of deals it formerly won. That is highly unlikely to happen in my opinion, because it has been slow to respond the streaming TV and music business, while other players took the initiative and grabbed the market lead. Beyond TV and music content, it's a somewhat disturbing sign that Apple - at least in some markets - is losing its sense of urgency and aggressive tactics. That could be a problem over the long term. Citing a source at Apple that didn't want to be identified, the New York Times said a potential advantage for Apple would be that it won't be offering a free tier for its streaming subscription service, which could be an attempt to woo music industry executives. As usual though, the music industry has been complaining about Spotify in particular offering so much free music that it fails to incentivize potential customers to buy the music. This is the wrong way to look at it, as free music is what gets people interested, and eventually leads them to acquire the service. So at least from the point of view of the music industry, Apple may provide a better distribution model for the songs offered. I think the industry is wrong, based upon Internet businesses I've owned and operated, as the more you give away, the more people tend to get interested in all the products you have to sell. This is true with Kindle (NASDAQ: AMZN ) books, and many other digital products as well. The only way I see this helping Apple is if it eventually wins concessions from the music industry to lower its licensing fees so it can offer its streaming subscriptions for a lower price. If over time it doesn't win those concessions, I see its competitors to continue to grow share, while Apple remains a relatively small player in the market. Looking at the existing revenue generated by Apple, which stands at about $183 billion annually at this time, the comparably tiny streaming music market doesn't appear to be that significant or important. And looking at it as a standalone business and over the short term, that is definitely true. But when you add on Apple TV and iTunes radio, that slightly changes the outlook, as it without a doubt shows Apple is struggling in what will over time, become the preferred way people consume entertainment of any kind. Anything that can be digitized with be streamed, and those streaming subscriptions will eventually become the primary revenue stream for distributors. Having said that, Apple's primary threat isn't in streaming, as I view that as something the company would be willing to sacrifice in regard to margin and earnings in order to achieve its primary goal, which is to sell its various devices. But if it loses big in the streaming subscription wars, it could eventually lose big in the gadget wars, and that is the real danger Apple faces in the long term. It's not that the streaming music market will have much of an impact on Apple in the near term, it's that consumers could stop identifying with Apple as they have in the past because of the new brands emerging. For that reason it's important to watch how Apple responds to the streaming music market, and other streaming subscription markets, as that is the future, and how it positions itself competitively will determine its long-term performance. At this early stage of the streaming subscription game, Apple has fallen behind. It must work hard to change that in the near future, or it could lose the future, in regard to its gadgets, which is of course where the company makes its real money.
