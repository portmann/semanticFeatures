AMD: 4 Reasons Why Cash Is Much More Important Than Jim Keller's Departure - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) | Seeking Alpha Keller leaves but that's his modus operandi. CFO Kumar says the company needs a minimum of $500M in cash to operate effectively. Just recently AMD (NASDAQ: AMD ) announced the departure of its lead chip designer, the industry-famous Jim Keller, for the ubiquitous "to pursue other opportunities". Well, at least it wasn't "to spend more time with his family". That one is a sure sign he got canned. In this article, I explain why Keller leaving AMD is less important to its future than the cash position the company has at the end of this quarter. In the not-too-distant past, the bottom number was $600M, but last quarter AMD CFO changed that to $500M. I think AMD may be dangerously close to that number now. I leave, and the leaving is so exhilarating I know I can never go back. But then what? We have all known extremely bright people who get bored easily. I have a sneaking suspicion Keller is one of those people. He gets excited, does some groundbreaking work (DEC Alpha, Athlon, x86-64 bit etc.), then gets bored and looks around for something exciting again. Since 1998 when he was with DEC (remember it?) working on its most advanced Alpha processor until today Keller has had 7 different employments including AMD (twice), SiByte, Broadcom (NASDAQ: BRCM ), P.A. Semiconductor, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and then AMD again. That's 7 jobs in 27 years or less than 4 years per job. He's been at AMD for his second go round just over 3 years or about average for him. As a comparison, how many jobs have you had in the last 27 years? The design function is certainly complete for Zen and that's the part that keeps a guy like Keller interested. At this point, it is in the hands of the manufacturing engineers at AMD and Global Foundries. Whatever minor changes that are involved going forward will not require a talent like Keller's to implement. The key to AMD's success is to get the Zen out the door, and there is little or nothing Keller can do about that anyway. My guess is K12 work, the other design that probably interested Keller originally, has been put on the back burner until at least 2017 and that left Keller with nothing that really interested him so adios. 3. The size of the pie is shrinking so cash may shrink too. At the end of 2014, AMD CFO Devinder Kumar said that the goal was to have between $600M and $1B in cash at all times. At the end of last quarter, he downgraded the low end a bit to $500M. Now supposedly that was because of cuts made in headcount and R&D, but still for a company AMD's size that is a significant chunk of cash. Quarterly sales in the last year have dropped $500M ($1.44B to 942M) and cost of goods sold by $237M ($947M to $710M), so certainly less cash should be needed to run the day-to-day operations. But inventories jumped $110M last quarter to $799M and are now very close to quarterly sales of $829M, which is not a good sign. Although cash was OK at the end of last quarter, AMD has had negative free cash flow four out of the last 5 quarters for a total of negative $238M. 4. AMD needs to get Zen out the door in 2016 or it needs an infusion of cash between now and 2017. In my opinion, Zen is the most important development for AMD since the Athlon. If the company is successful, then sales in the x86 world, both desktop and servers, will soar as AMD more evenly competes with Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ). Remember, because AMD is so small compared to Intel capturing just an additional small 2% percentage of Intel's $50B in PC and server sales would about double AMD's current Computing and Enterprise server sales (my est. $250M/qtr. not counting console chip sales). If AMD gets 5% of Intel sales, profits will certainly surge to levels not seen in years and correspondingly the price of its stock. AMD continues to struggle as it tries to bring more competitive products to market. Sales continue to decrease, and AMD management continues to cut expenses. The key product for real sales and profit growth is the Zen product designed and brought to its current point by great chip designer Jim Keller. But the design phase is over and now management needs to get Zen into production quickly and efficiently. Rumors continue of a buyout, and with its x86 production rights and Zen possibilities in desktop and servers, I would think there would be more than a little interest from outside parties. Supporting that contention is CEO Lisa Su's approach to outside investors looking for an investment to carry it over to the launch of Zen (and maybe K12) a year or two down the road. Earlier this year, we reported that Lisa Su had met with investment firms to discuss possible options for AMD, including restructuring or spinning off parts of the company. The recent GPU restructuring might or might not be part of a deal. - ExtremeTech Absent an investment (equity or convertible preferred) or a buyout, AMD may be in a race with the cliff somewhere in the distance but not all that far away. But with its IP and the high sales potential of products in the pipeline, I don't think AMD will go out of business. The company's assets are unique in an industry constantly looking for uniqueness. If it can launch Zen in 2016 and maintain or increase its position in graphics, then the stock price has huge upside potential as I have previously written in " AMD: This Intel Ankle-Biter Is On Its Way To Substantial Profits " and here " 10 Reasons Why AMD Will Be $10 By 2017 ". Treat AMD stock as a LEAP without an expiration date. You are not likely to lose it all, but if it does get even a small percentage of Intel's desktop and server sales with Zen, then profits will be large indeed.
