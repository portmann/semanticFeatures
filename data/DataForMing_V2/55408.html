Verizon Wireless 8% Customer Loyalty Discount â€” My Money Blog May 9, 2015 By Jonathan Ping Leave a Comment If you have Verizon Wireless but don’t already have a good employee or education discount on your plan , you may want to try this Customer Loyalty Discount at vzw.com/appreciation .   You may qualify for up to 8% off of your monthly access fee.   Note the following fine print: *Discounts apply to plan monthly access fees of $34.99+ and data features of $24.99+ when added to a plan of $34.99+. On Share Everything and More Everything plans, discounts apply only to the Account Access fees. Prepaid, already discounted and promotional plans are not eligible for discounts through this program. In addition, after reading through the Fatwallet and Slickdeals forum threads, please note the following: Submitting the form will attempt to apply the discount. Even though the page suggests that you are only checking your eligibility (“complete the form below to see if you qualify”), it will in fact attempt to apply the discount to your line immediately. Your employee discount may be removed. Basically, be careful before submitting the form. If you have for example a 15% employee discount and sign up for this plan, the new 8% discount will actually replace your existing 15% discount.  You will have to re-validate your employee discount if it is removed, requiring additional time and effort.  A previously grandfathered employee discount may also be lowered upon re-validation. Despite these warnings, I bet there are plenty of Verizon customers out there without a corporate discount that wouldn’t mind shaving a few bucks off their monthly bill.
