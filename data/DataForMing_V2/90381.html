FedEx - Growth Concerns Remain Following Weak Earnings; $179 PT - FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) | Seeking Alpha We are seeing a consumer priority shift from speed to quality in the shipping market, and believe this shift could yield mixed results for FedEx. We believe increased fuel expenses, stagnated revenue, and increased competition should partially offset margin growth from Expense cost-cutting program expected to yield results in the back half of fiscal 2016. While new-age competitors like Amazon do not pose elimination threats to FedEx, they do present urban competition, which could adversely effect top and bottom line. We believe FedEx is a Hold and have a $179 price target on the stock, with speculative upside potential from successful European market transition with TNT Express acquisition. We are initiating coverage on FedEx Corporation (NYSE: FDX ) with a $179 1-year Price Target and a 'Hold' rating. We believe that while margins will benefit from FedEx's cost-cutting strategies and share buyback programs, this growth will be offset by a shifting consumer priority. Several threats are rising in the e-commerce business, including Amazon, which concern us about healthy topline growth. There has been a clear shift in consumer priority from speed to quality, as Express revenues have decreased both sequentially and YoY while Ground revenues have increased both sequentially and YoY. We believe this shift will accelerate given the existence of convenient speed-substitutes. While margins will improve due to an Express cost-savings plan to be completed by the end of this fiscal year, we feel these improvements will be mitigated by stagnated revenue and increased fuel costs. Furthermore, while we do not believe Amazon poses a risk to FedEx as a whole business, we do believe Amazon adds legitimate competition to FedEx is select urban areas. Based on our fair net present value calculation, FDX is currently trading at 9x EBITDA and 19x earnings, which we feel are fair multiples for a mature company with low-growth prospects and intense competition. Sales trends are illustrating a shift in FedEx's consumers' priority from speed to quality, and we believe this trend aligns appropriately with macro drivers. Express revenues have decreased both sequentially and YoY in the past 2 fiscal years, while Ground revenues have increased both sequentially and YoY in the past 2 fiscal years. This trend makes sense to us, and we expect to see it continue in the foreseeable future. We believe the value of "speed-mail" lies in, as the name implies, the quickness with which something can be delivered. As far as letters and personal mail are concerned, the value offered by "speed-mail" can be offered via electronic messages. As far as packages and other deliveries are concerned, the value offered by "speed-mail" cannot be offered via electronic messages; however, we feel that a new dimension-based pricing model will continue to steer consumers to the cheaper Ground alternative. This trend was emphasized in Fiscal 2015, especially Q4, which saw Ground revenues and Freight revenues grow 19% and 10% YoY, while the faltering Express segment accelerated its downward YoY sales trend to -19% YoY. We can see that the Express cost-cutting plan is a necessary for the business moving forward, as Express operating margins lag noticeably behind Freight operating margins and lag dramatically behind Ground operating margins. We also feel, however, that this cost-cutting plan will only marginally widen margins, given the declining Express sales trend described above. We do, however, believe Express revenues will be helped FedEx's acquisition of TNT; this revenue boost is already accounted for in our model and in management guidance, which our forecast falls in. It is also important to note that margins in each quarter throughout Fiscal 2015 were skewed by low fuel prices. While oil prices may not rebound to 2013 highs, we believe oil prices will increase noticeably by the 2nd half of Oracle's Fiscal 2016, which should offset some of Express segment's margin gains. In attempts to cut operating costs and improve shipping times to customers, Amazon is investing heavily in their shipping and distribution processes. Amazon's ultimate goal is to provide same-day shipping to its customers (comparable to FedEx Express), with a focus on the "last mile" of a package's delivery. The company is hoping to begin drone deliveries by the end of 2017 at the latest and is exploring the development of an app that allows individuals to deliver packages, similar to Uber's business model. FedEx Vice President Mike Glenn expressed doubt towards the suggestion that Amazon poses a threat to established shipping businesses. When asked about tech companies trying to construct their own distribution networks, Glenn said: "When you talk about the challenges of building a network, the scale, the input costs, the technology issues and the customer experience required to deliver what customers expect of companies like FedEx and our primary competitors, it's a pretty tall hill to climb." Glenn raises valid points. While Amazon could conceivably compete with FedEx in select urban settings, FedEx has significant advantages over Amazon in cities outside of Amazon's current experimental shipping operations and more suburban or rural areas. Amazon would have to invest significantly more money just to match FedEx's current shipping infrastructure, let alone FedEx's own efforts to offer wide-scale same-day shipping in the future. Furthermore, consumers are more trusting of receiving their packages from FedEx and other shipping companies, so it's probable that Amazon's proposed new shipping methods meet initial resistance in the market. On the whole, Amazon's investment in shipping and distribution should not threaten FedEx or its competitors in the shipping industry. We do feel, however, that Amazon, with its large e-commerce reach, does pose a risk to stealing market share in urban areas (city-to-city transactions). Based on our calculations, we believe FDX is currently trading at 9x NPV-future EBITDA and 18x NPV-future EPS. We like to use a multiple on the NPV of future EBITDA and earnings as we feel this appropriately accounts for the future growth prospects of the company. Important to note, though, that this subjects the model's accuracy to the accuracy of our revenue and margin forecasts. Express revenues decrease 5% YoY in fiscal 2016, in-line with the trend we identified earlier. Express revenues continue to decline at a 1.5% CAGR thereafter, and eventually report flat in Fy20. We believe this accurately reflects the decreasing popularity for "speed-mail" amongst FedEx users. Ground revenues increase 20% YoY in fiscal 2016, in-line with the trend we identified earlier. Ground revenues continue to increase at a 5% CAGR thereafter. We believe this accurately reflects the shift in consumer priority to the cheap alternative. Freight revenues increase 10% YoY in fiscal 2016, and at a 8% CAGR thereafter into Fy20. Freight sales have increased in this fashion, and we have no reason to believe sales will deviate from this pattern. Margins improve, beginning in the back-half of fiscal 2016, to a 16% operating margin by Fy16 and a 8% net profit margin by Fy20.
