Ford Motor (F) Presents at dbAccess IAA Cars 2015 Brokers Conference (Transcript) | Seeking Alpha Okay. Well, our next presentation, we’re very pleased to be welcoming management from Ford Motor Company. As all of you know, Ford’s execution over the past few years has been truly impressive. The Company -- we’re just talking about how the Company has radically transformed its product portfolio. They have achieved very impressive improvements in profitability. They have entered new markets. And over the next year, just going around the world, in North America, the business should continue to benefit from one of the newest product portfolios in the industry with new and significantly refreshed products including the Mustang, the Transit, The Focus, The Edge and continued ramp up of the Ford F-150. Europe accounts for around 22% of the Company’s volume. The Company is still loss making but they believe that they’re on track to turn profitable over the next year or so, which would result in its fairly significant improvement in profitability and cash flow for the overall Company. Joining us from Ford today, I’m very pleased to welcome Jim Farley. Jim is President of the Europe, Middle East and Africa. Thank you, Rod. I’m thrilled to present to you our plan and to give an update. My background is I spent almost 20 years with Toyota including here in Europe and responsible for Lexus and then left Toyota eight years ago to join Ford and management team. And I was Head of Marketing, Sales and Service for the Company and Stephen Odell, the Head of Europe and I switched jobs about nine months ago. And I’m relatively new to Europe but not my first chance as I’ve being here. So, I am going to spend about 20 minutes just taking you through our status and then leave the rest of time for Q&A. So, I think all of you are very familiar with our One Ford plan, maybe you are not, but our idea is pretty simple, aggressively restructure the business to operate profitably; accelerate the development of products that people want; and financial plan and improve our balance sheet; and improve our balance sheet and work together as one team. The key tenet for us is deliver products with passion which we think is a difference maker for us. I know everyone says that but I’ll highlight that more and also innovate in every part of our business which is increasingly a focus for us as the leadership team. And here’s our key long-term objectives. We want to be a 10% plan in the global automotive business in terms of share and top-five sales company; more balanced in our regional profits, as Rod said, so, Europe is a very key part of rebalancing our risk in company; operating margins of eight-plus and also be a top quartile TSR company; and as well, be highly regarded by our view and all of our stakeholders. To do that, we believe we have to bet on strong brands. And we have a different brand philosophy than other companies. We’ve simplified the portfolio of brands in the Company. And we believe the Ford brand is quite flexible actually where we can sell. Serve all markets that mostly mean expansion in Middle East and Asia; and compete in all key parts best-in-class products across the whole competition patch. The other area that I would like to emphasize is Smart Mobility, I am sure all of you wondering what this means for a car company. This is an area we really want to leaning on. We were very affected by the SYNC experience in North America. And this is something that we’re thinking about on much larger scale now how the digital world would change our business and how Ford will be ahead of that. And the last area is just improve our margins, obviously top-line revenue and our efficiency and I’ll talk a lot about that in Europe. So, let’s talk about the Europe business. 2012, the Company announced the strategy to improve after a few years of very challenging losses in Europe. We focused on three areas. Since 2012, a lot has changed. These tenets haven’t changed but we have launched 25 new products in Europe, a whole host of products across segments as Rod mentioned. And some of the real highlights for us is our commercial vehicle business which I’ll touch on in a moment. And we’ve learned a lot, but the good thing is our products are generally very well accepted and we’ve been able to deliver the pricing and other positive revenue along with that. We’ve also closed a very large manufacturing facility in Belgium and in South Hampton, so continued to rationalize our capacity in Europe. And we’ve taken those products and redistributed them among the remainder on our plants. We have a very efficient operation at Turkey, very large operation where we make all of our commercial vehicles. So, here is some of the key developments; I mentioned the products, really leaning to the performance space. We’ve learned a lot from the -- learned from competitors in this area of derivatives, so listed transaction price of our mainstream products. I think this is a real chance to improve not only the brand but really drive higher transaction prices and we’re really starting with the performance line up. We’re now that number one brand in Europe on a number of models with five star ratings which is great. We did get recognize the most innovative volume brand this year by the German Center of Automotive Management. The brand has been getting healthier. We separated ourselves from the other mainstream brands. We still have a very large gap to Volkswagen. And more and more we’re competing directly with the premium brands in almost every segment. So the brand is very important to us. We launched Ford Stores. It’s a very large, well-funded, digitally enabled dealership in all the major markets across Europe. We’re on the way to 500 of them; we’ve about 100 done and this is very important for our brand initiative. We’ve also launched Vignale. We’ve a very high mix of our high series now; Titanium, on our higher transaction price vehicles. We want to retain those customers. We’re not trying to steal customers from Audi or the premium brands. We want to make sure we retain our loyal customers, make sure to give them more than just a normal high series. We have a very different dealership experience from Vignale; same make own our cars which is very unusual in Europe even for the premium brands. We have dedicated dealership people. And even Vignale is sold through a much narrow distribution channel compared to normal Ford. We’re also doing it for Mustang and other special products. I am happy to say that in August we became the number one brand in commercial vehicles in Europe outselling, both Mercedes and Volkswagen. Three years ago, we were number seven. We have a complete line of commercial vehicles, B and C size in great advance; a 1 and 2 Tonne Transit and a very successful Ranger import from South Africa. We’ve also redone our whole distribution network for commercial business. And it’s a real signature part of our profitability going forward. On cost, I mentioned the changes in consolidation of our manufacturing operations. We also continue to work with our union partners to get to more efficiency out of labor and overhead. We just finished last year labor agreement in Cologne. You may not be aware of this but ironically where we make the Fiesta in Cologne, we have the most efficient plants in the world, the lowest labor overhead of any place but that’s a very benchmark facility for us and for the industry and even with that we are able to getting new labor agreement. We’ll see how that impacts our performance. What we care about the Ford in Europe is profitable healthy share growth. We recognize the importance of scale, but we’re not going to do that and deteriorate our margin. So, we have been growing the business for two years in a row now. And year-to-date we’re as you can see about 8% but probably more important for you than the share itself is the kind of quality of that business and I’ll touch on that in a second. And it’s very linked to the changing European general mix as well here. We pay a lot of attention to the channels we sell our product into. And that is important; in fact more important than our share growth. So, here is I would like to touch on that; biggest meaning question I got. Hey Jim, the industry is getting healthier in Europe, what does that mean for Ford and your profitability? When you really dissect the business by channel, there is four distinct channels for the OEMs in Europe on the passenger cars side. We have of course retail; we have fleet and fleet goes from user chooses this all the way to very volumes fleet owners in CD business. But you have two very important channels, one is rental which is some markets in Southern Europe is very large, could be a third of the industry and also dealer demo self registered products sold from the OE directly to their dealers who in the course of maybe two months or three months most of the programs turning to used cost. And I just want to emphasize to all of you that our strategy in Europe is very different for each of those channels, and our share is by far the lowest in the last two. Contribution margins are very different for all brands. And I think this is a key signature part of our profitable growth on the revenue side. I really wanted to highlight the importance of our CD business. It’s something we don’t talk a lot about and it’s a very important part of us competing with the luxury brands here in Europe. And the success has really been fueled by all of our new products essentially came out in the 24-month period but the 1 Tonne Transit which is vehicle not sold in the U.S. is the red Transit that particular vehicle has been incredibly well accepted. And we make virtually all these vehicles in the low cost locations. The Transit Carrier, the top white vehicle and the two Transits, the middle, larger vans both made in Turkey; the Transit Connect is made in Spain and the Ranger is made in South Africa, imported to Europe. These are very important high transaction price products customers are willing to pay for future content and capabilities. The environment here, I think you know it as well as everyone. Obviously the key things we’re watching is the real strength of the growth, the currencies very carefully as well as the upcoming regulatory changes that was in the board meeting this morning and we spent most of our time talking about the upcoming regulatory environment here in Europe and very important topic for us as a business. I wanted to talk about the growth in the industry this year to emphasize the different cycle of growth across Europe. As you can see, the leading markets for year-over-year growth have been in Portugal, Spain, Italy, the austerity markets off a very low base are dominated by being CCARs. And as you can see, Northern Europe, the growth has been much more modest. Even though overall Europe is up 9%, the mature markets are much less. And a lot of that growth in mature markets is actually the rental and self registered products. So the retail and fleet, the key parts of the markets are growing. It’s really exciting to see the organic growth in Europe. It’s just not -- it’s not nearly as high as yield on industry. You saw I think August we just reported while we were here, it’s about 11% increase for the industry. Just think about little bit more complexity about that growth, there is definitely growth that’s happening in retail and fleet but it’s not happening everywhere. And it’s very important to pay attention to the channels themselves. Russia I’m sure is the big part of your question to us, to any OEM. Ford has made a particular bet in Russia. Right now Russia is running at about 1.61 units that we put it fourth or fifth and in terms of size in Europe, still very significant market. Ford’s been on Europe in Russia couple of years ago and actually had winning operation and we did a couple of key things. We found a really good partner Sollers, has very good relationships with the government and that has proven to be very beneficial to us as a company. The second thing is we decided to refresh all of our products. So we have seven products in Russia, they are all essentially brand new. We’ve launched four just this year. So going into tough market, we have very, very fresh products. And that allows us to manage the capital over time. And obviously the market right now in unit operations -- the units of the industry are down, kind of also biggest issue is of course the euro to ruble exchange rate. We’ve heavily localized but we still import some parts and that currency is very important to all of the industry and every brand has a different pricing strategy. We’re very focused on managing short-term through this by looking at our pricing, our cost, our investment, our structural cost to make sure that we’re as efficient as we can, but we manage the opportunity on the upside. And we really believe that we’re still at that industry that can be above 3 million units like it was in the past. Our pretax results for the first half in Europe, as you can see, we lost about $200 million that carry over from last year but there is two very important things I would like you to look out on this chart. As you can see very positive, about $300 million of top line revenue growth in terms of improved profitability but we destocked the business as you could see about $300 million. And also pricing we’re seeing is not just top line pricing for our new products, we have a lot of new products just coming out now. All of our large cars are brand new. Mondeo is brand; S-Max; Galaxy; they are all brand new. And as they’re coming out, we’re getting feature content but really what we’re getting is mix and rates. People are buying much nicer Fords. And that is really flowing into the bottom line banks in a way we anticipated. The industry is up, our share is up. That’s good to see profitability [ph] holds up but what’s really important is that pricing line. The other thing when you go to the cost, contribution cost has been largely a carryover, year-over-year. Our pension costs of course with discounts were lower as we got a $100 million headwind year-over-year. I’d like to ask you to look at the prior year reserve release we renegotiated with German Union, a beneficial contract and that was abandoned to us last year, not this year, that change that reversal so to speak, plus the stocks are more than 400 -- almost $400 million, $350 million. So, the point is the business is getting healthier. If we take out those long repeating items, the underlying European Ford business continues to get healthier year-over-year. We broke even despite those very significant financial impacts. Our outlook for the business, I’ll try to just make this very quick. We’re really focusing on the profit pools in Europe. Looking at those segments that not only have volume but more importantly provide really healthy contribution margins, we’re oriented our cycle plan on those. And that will require a lot of adjustments and we can talk about that in Q&A. We really want to expand our performance line-up, not because we are gear heads but because we found that in mix and rates, this is a really huge opportunity. The people that own those vehicles, we compete very successfully with luxury players. We launched RS today; it’s €10,000 cheaper than the equivalent Audi. And we can do better volume than them and very good margins even on a mainstream product like Focus. And we will continue to expand this area. I think the luxury players have done a great job. You can buy an ANG [ph] badge by itself. And I think how we democratize this for the higher transaction content will be a key part of our future business here in Europe. And obviously, we want to continue to expand and invest in the commercial business, because of our success, our reputation and our capability. On the brand side, we want to really move to brand much more to emotional space. In the past, we’ve been trying to compete on technology. And although that’s very important for customers in Europe, it’s become less of a differentiator in the space that is unique to Ford. In the Smart Mobility space that may be the exception, but for the brands, this is more emotional, heavily utility support derivates that are higher transaction place that have more of an opinion. This is the area where we’re going to move the brand more and more. On the cost side, we have a lot of activity going on. Site reviews, product line reviews, commodity reviews with our suppliers, the cost and being fully competitive with our competitors or even better than them in Europe is a key part of our management team’s effort. And we have many energy rooms and cross-functional teams working on every part of our cost. And so on key part, we want to be a benchmark cost competitors here in Europe and there’s a lot to do. SUV’s is a big part of our story here. And in Geneva, we committed to having five new SUV or Crossover products to compete in those spaces over the next couple of years. And that’s a big shift for us. It’s also an area of competency for Ford, globally. Believe it or not, our share in these segments in Europe underrepresented compared to our overall share. I mentioned performance all the way from €400,000 GT down to a Fiesta ST. We feel this is territory that we can own that’s unique to us that we can continue to move those mix and rates up, not just for these products but for also the content that we develop uniquely. On Smart Mobility, I don’t want to give you a lot of -- a lot of time on this because it’s a company initiative and I think it’s important what we do not what we say. We’re in the pilot phase all over Europe with -- we’re actually running our own peer-to-peer service in London, we’re trying to do that to learn frankly. We’re actually doing same thing in Germany where we’ve got 150 cars in our own fleet. And its’ been very important learning for us as a company. But I think that there’s complete uniqueness in Europe on the Smart Mobility space. BlaBlaCar is a very important company to watch. They have I think 2 million users and unlike Uber and in U.S. it’s a very different model. It started as non-profit and it’s a car pooling service. And it works really well. I think that kind of service really fits in ease of Europe uniquely. Second was connected commercials vehicles offering fleet management to small companies, there is a lot of opportunities in Smart Mobility space because those customers are willing to pay for those services. So the key takeaways: We’re continuing make progress year-over-year and on our financials that’s not enough. Obviously we want to take advantage of the Smart Mobility space in Europe and maybe slightly unique here. We are just launching our CD products. I didn’t take a lot of time to explain that, but these are high revenue products that just coming to market now. So, in the second half of year will be a good revenue lift for us because of those products, to continue expand crossover and SUV line-up and continue to take advantage of our leadership in commercial vehicles including the enough of pick-up product here in Europe, the Ranger and is doing very well. And in summary, 2015 is the year of growth, innovation for us and importantly financial progress. Our guidance I think you know very well. In Europe, I think the guidance is twofold; first, we are committed to improve profitability year-over-year and second of all, we see the market between 15.7, 16.2, and that’s 16.2 is kind of where the third quarter seems to be playing out so far. Why don’t we kick it off with a couple of questions? I was hoping to ask you kind of a longer term question. If you think about the way the business is going to change over the next 5 and 10 years, and if you maybe highlight [indiscernible] use Volkswagen as an example in terms of how your ASPs track and what is that gap today? There are so many categories in the market, particularly in Europe that are very competitive. Is that expected to change and if not, how are you expecting to do well in that context? And then lastly, we keep on hearing about Smart Mobility, shared mobility, the ability of automakers to mine data that automakers have. But no one really in our position thinks about Ford in the same context as Google or Uber or any of these other opportunities that are valued very highly. So could those things actually be financially material to Ford and how would you get there? Great question, I think you covered the real essence. In the short-term, the regulatory contents that we have to look at including electrification is of course probably one of the biggest issues for our industry and I think we have a good plan there and we can talk about in more detail. But if you look a little bit longer horizon, I think there are couple of key things. For mainstream manufacturer like Ford, you have to pick where you compete very, very carefully. I think in Europe, this is a particular point and important decision for the leadership team and the business. I think CD is a great example of an area where we as a component that’s an area where the Company has some natural competency. But it’s hard to not invest in other areas. So, I think being smarter and more objective about where we put that investment is really key trend for us as a company. And as I said that’s going to play out here in Europe especially. I really think that Smart Mobility is very large space. Of course it covers so much from automated cars and data analytics, as you mentioned the connected regular car to so many other things. But really there is a couple of key points. I think that transportation wallet, a big transportation wallet buses, public transportation, people buy their own cars. The part that is an individual customer buying, an individual car is a big wallet, is a big number. So, the opportunity I think for Ford is it’s very well positioned in the space I believe because of the management team has this experience we think and maybe a small example of North America. But I saw it personally change our brand image and the $200 feature change the content, the preference of purchase to Ford. And I think this is the same leadership team. We really lean into the space because we have that specific experience. And I believe on the commercial, for example in Europe, there is tremendous top-line revenue growth for us that I don’t see a Google or an Apple or others doing. But we have to be again smart about deploying our capital on our course, smart about where we compete in that space and who are our partners which will be increasingly important. And there is a lot to talk about on that space, I think if you transform our fixed marketing investment because of the ownership. If we make the ownership experience to a mobile phone, we almost never talk to an owner once they own the vehicle. If we can transform the frequency of interaction with the customer which is very realistic with the connected car and a great set of feature content, we can really change a loyalty model in our company and that will really change the fixed marketing and marketing paradigm. And then there is I think -- Rod there is a lot there, so I don’t want to go on too long. The other thing about Smart Mobility when you think about as the economics of the electric car, we’ve always thought about the electric car’s one person buying in. But Smart Mobility can give us -- could be a game changer on electrification ownership. Multiple people use it, are renting it. That cost can differ of the more people and investment is just different. And I think we’ve seen that in houses where they’re paying [ph] and a lot of things. So I think this is especially for us as a brand, this is a very important to understand for our electrification line-up frame competing in our space. I would say those are the key regulatory costs or something that we’re right on the horizon right now. And we see a bit of a different reality in commercial vehicles in terms of pricing versus passenger cars. And really that’s another reason why we are so good on cost. Because we have to do everything we can on non-customer facing content to get that cost down, so we can absorb that cost that’s coming our way, a portion of which the customers may not be able to -- willing to pay for, we should at least approach to the business that way. I guess in terms of I did ask about this bridge of perception also Ford brand and Volkswagen and there was a lot of -- there is a fairly dramatic transformation of where the Ford brand was positioned versus Toyota and the Japanese OEMs and North America. Is that something that is quantifiable? You can give us some sense of what is the opportunity I think you are looking at now that could… It’s a great question, that one I was personally involved in. Obviously situation is a little different here but we track of metrical favorability, brand favorability is probably the highest correlation to revenue, whether you are taking a pricing or share or whatever. Brand favorability which is the people or the percentage of people have a very favorable opinion of the market itself, not a nameplate but the brand. And it comes to life and also it’s a way as you can see then research when we reel the brand and what happens with the pricing we know with the new model. And we’ve been managing the brand health through that metric for eight plus years now. And our beat financially in the U.S. was a lot on pricing side as you know. And we had a 10-plus-percent increase in favorability and completely separated ourselves from where we have been and actually beat Toyota during their crisis around their quality. In Europe, we saw a similar improvement in favorability but the gap is not as large, it’s not double-digits but in Germany and it’s different in different countries. In France, we didn’t see the same lift; in the UK we’re absolutely the leading brand in brand inventory right now, actually equal to Volkswagen. And so each country is different. Germany is probably one of the ones we watch the most and in Germany we’ve spirited ourselves but GM has gotten better but we’re still much above GM but still a large gap to Volkswagen. For different brands, that plays different, just as Volkswagen and Skoda, you can trade off different brands as well on the favorability. But we’ve seen an improvement and we’ve seen improvement in our price position because of it, not only on the commercial side but also in the passenger car side, with fresh product. Question is what do we do next? So, we got a lift, there is still a gap; what you do now? And I think for me and the organization, I’m especially focused on the inventory gap to the semi-premium players like Volvo and even the premium players because the reality is we’re competing with them. And so, we challenge ourselves since I’ve been here for nine months is what’s the brand direction from our product or services that’s going to get us competitive with -- I know it sounds crazy but with premium brands. And I think it’s important to have the aspiration out there because to move favorability to the next level, we really think based on our research that that will be more on the emotional territory. And I know every brand says that, but I’ve been doing this a long time. And to emotionalize the brands in reality is a very tricky thing, but it can be done. When I look at the intensity of our sports performance customers and this is not a small business in Europe. If you look at Audio or Mercedes or BMW’s mix of their sports series, it is not a small mix. It could be 20 plus percent of their business in some vehicle lines. When you look at the favorability of Ford customers who want one of those kind of products and luxury competitors, there is no favorable gap. It’s interesting; utilities, very similar phenomenon; very similar phenomenon on CDs. So for smarter than investing in derivatives of our mainstream products and choose the right segments where we can compete successfully with them, I think Rod, we can improve our favorability but it requires some tough choices on our capital. Does that mean that Ford -- you’re aspiring to be a higher market share company? It seems like there’s a bit of a disconnect, if you’re saying that you’re going to be picking your spots and focusing on the areas where you can really distinguish yourself versus all these other mass market areas that you need to compete and their different business models that you’re looking at for attacking the more competitive segments or is there -- what sort of the plan in ensuring that? It’s a great question and very logical one. I wish I could you give you all the details but I think it’s for another day, because we’re soaring through. But I absolutely think there’s -- I know from experience that there’s a way to do it. I think on the volume products, this derivate strategy is very important for us. On the utility that’s a capital allocation opportunity for us. And those are high volume segments in Europe. Look at Captur, Qashqai and Kadjar even within premium, look at GLA, these are mainstream segments for the competing volume with B and C sized monthly volumes. And then the commercial side is also very high volume product. So, don’t want to get in all the details, but I think Rod there’s -- I think if we’re very smart -- when we’re very smart about allocating our capital and going to market and the way we invest our capital on how those products come to life in the services, I do believe there’s a way for us to accomplish both things. Do you think that there’s an opportunity to achieve -- you talked about 8% plus margins for company-wide, does that something that you’re aspiring to in Europe as well? Well, I think the key thing for us is just -- first step is for us to get the profitability which is the key milestone for us. The next step is to make sure that we’re attractive within the company for capital. I really believe that the European business for a lot of reasons should contribute to the overall company in a way beyond just the profits. There are things to learn here that are good for the overall company. And it’s important for us even to have a return that’s attractive enough that the business wants to invest in Europe. And so, we have the specific number in mind. I wish I could tell you about that. The team’s laser focused on that number. And we’re going to get there, one way or another. And it’s critical because we want to be a vibrant part of Ford globally. Okay. If any of you who want to a drive a Mustang here in Europe, just let us know. It’s a really fun thing to do. Thanks a lot for your attention. I’ll give it back to you, Rod. Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.
