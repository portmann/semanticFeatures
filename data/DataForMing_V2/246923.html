Disney ratchets up royalty rate on Star Wars products - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha To screen ETFs by asset class, performance, yield and more, check out the ETF Hub. ETF Hub Nov 25 2015, 08:48 ET | By: Clark Schultz , SA News Editor Sales of Star Wars consumer products could reach $5B over the first year after the December release date of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, according to some high-flying projections. Disney (NYSE: DIS ) turned the screws on licensing partners by working a deal for a ~20% royalty which is about double the normal rate. Hasbro (NASDAQ: HAS ) is the major licensee for Star Wars toys, while a host of other companies have bits and pieces - including Jakks Pacific (NASDAQ: JAKK ), Lego, Kay Jewelers (NYSE: SIG ), Topps, Electronic Arts (NASDAQ: EA ), Rubie's Costume Company, and even CoverGirl (NYSE: COTY ). Gave my grandson 1 share of DIS for his first birthday. Better return for him long term than a toy! I think that Disney should get an even higher licensing rate. I don't think that 30 % would have been unreasonable.
