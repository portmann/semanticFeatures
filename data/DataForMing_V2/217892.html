Dialog Semi Earnings And The Chipmakers Sell-Off - Dialog Semiconductor Plc (OTCMKTS:DLGNF) | Seeking Alpha Power-management chipmaker Dialog reported disappointing Q3 results Monday. Atmel, Apple, and other chipmakers reacted sharply as a result. The Germany-based semiconductors company Dialog Semiconductor ( OTC:DLGNF ) reported its preliminary results for Q3 2015 Monday with lower than expected Q3 revenues and weak Q4 guidance, as presented in the table below. Dialog's stock price reacted sharply to the disappointing results, declining more than 18% on the Frankfurt stock exchange on Monday and an additional 7% on Tuesday. Dialog's performance directly impacts two companies: Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Atmel (NASDAQ: ATML ). Apple is impacted since Dialog is a main supplier of power management chips for the iPhone and iPad, and Apple is its largest customer to date. Atmel is impacted in light of the expected acquisition in which some of the payment will be through Dialog's shares. Apple's stock price fell 3% on investors' concerns that Dialog's guidance implies that Apple will release weaker earnings today after the market is closed. As Dialog's results came just a couple of days before Apple's reports, its Q4 earnings investors use that as a proxy for Apple's iPhone sales performance and 2016 outlook. That link drove down stock prices of other Apple suppliers, like Skyworks (NASDAQ: SWKS ), Qorvo (NASDAQ: QRVO ), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ), Broadcom (NASDAQ: BRCM ). Even though this event might signal a slowdown in Apple's cash machine (iPhone), I remain bullish on Apple in light of its enterprise initiatives led by the iPad Pro as well as the partnerships with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and IBM (NYSE: IBM ) to support the corporate ecosystem. As I mentioned in an earlier article , I believe Apple will gain a significant market share in the mobile/electronic payments market with the Apple Pay service and will be able to drive transaction costs down while increasing incoming transaction fees. Also, I believe it will be able to generate substantial revenues from TV and Music initiatives. All of these factors should be taken into consideration before selling the stock based on one supplier's performance/guidance. Atmel's stock price fell 11% since part of the payment expected from Dialog will be made through Dialog's shares, which creates a direct link between Atmel's share price and Dialog's share price until the deal is closed and executed. The price Dialog has agreed to pay for acquiring Atmel is $4.65 in cash and 0.112 of Dialog American Depository Stock ('ADS'), which values the deal at $8.47 per Atmel share. This amount is significantly lower than the $10.42 price mentioned in the original announcement from Sep 20, but still 10% higher than Atmel's current price. I remain bullish on Atmel in light of the expected deal and its strong positioning in the IoT market, as presented in an earlier article . Even though Dialog's results may indicate a slowdown in iPhone sales (and that's a big 'may') - and a drastic emotional reaction is expected and reasonable these days when the market is unstable -, I believe most of the chipmakers were oversold. Apple's suppliers that were down yesterday went south on the sole belief that they will be significantly impacted by an iPhone sales decline; however, Dialog's case don't have to be the case for every supplier. Apple has its own needs and inventory build that could drive different demands from different suppliers. Let's not forget that Apple might be a very important supplier for many chipmakers, but Apple is not the only smartphones/consumer electronics company in the market, and not all suppliers will be significantly impacted from a potential iPhone slowdown. Before selling one of the chipmakers, investors should evaluate these chipmakers' entire portfolio, revenue streams, and growth potential. I believe it's important to stick to the facts and not to rush to liquidate positions. I agree that Atmel is less attractive right now after the Dialog price correction; however, it is still a leading IoT chip supplier. The dialog might experience lower than expected demand from Apple, but the implication for Apple's performance or Qualcomm, for example, is far from an immediate direct impact. I remain bullish on both Apple and Atmel for the moment. Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
