More Woes For Intel: Chip, Chip, Chipping Away At Chipzilla - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Mar. 24, 2015  9:27 PM ET  |  About: Intel Corporation (INTC) , Includes: AAPL , AMD , ARMH , MSFT , MU , QCOM , SSNLF by: Anchorite Intel recently reported that its first-quarter revenues would be down about a billion dollars. Lower revenues from desktop forecasts will probably continue. The new fiscal year 2015 had barely started, when Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) had to back away from projections it made just in January. Slowing desktop sales are impacting the top line by roughly a billion dollars a quarter, and if it continues through the year, revenue may actually decline in 2015 relative to 2014, rather than rising in "mid-single" digits as predicted. Mid-single digits would only be about $3 billion. But decreasing sales are just one of Intel's problems. There are also issues with competition, contra-revenue, aggressive timelines for 3D NAND that may not be met, and of course, the management of the company in general. Some of those issues I wrote about in previous articles here and here . ARM (NASDAQ: ARMH ) chips are everywhere. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) uses them in its iPhone and iPad, Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) uses them in its Snapdragon line, AMD uses them in its new Seattle server line, and so on. But in spite of the vast array of ARM chips in everything, from the cheapest phones to the most expensive servers, Intel has managed to maintain and even grow its lead in Windows (NASDAQ: MSFT ) desktop and servers. I think that going forward, this will become more difficult for Intel. The Wintel duopoly may see future challenges from WinARM. In January 2011, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer at the Consumer Electronics Show said this : Now I understand that Ballmer is no longer CEO, but I am certain that he did not say that without the approval of Chairman of the Board Bill Gates. And since Gates and Ballmer combined own $50 billion of MSFT stock, I do not think the current MSFT CEO, Satya Nadella, is going to change anything long term - although it does appear he has paused for the moment. But at last year's developer Build Conference , it sure sounded like full speed ahead. Since MSFT only has about 5% of the tablet market, there is lots of room for growth; and once tablets (and probably ARM) are more widespread with Windows, can desktops be far behind? If MS Office is on ARM , doesn't it make sense to put Windows on ARM too? This need for MSFT to move Windows to ARM is obvious when you look at how Apple iOS and Android are gaining market share. 2. All ARMS on Apple also makes sense. Right now, Apple uses ARM chips in all products except the iMacs. It makes no sense to keep the Macs on Intel if there is an ARM chip that can do it as well. The ARM chip will almost certainly be cheaper than Intel, and software support for Apple will be much easier when that is accomplished. Note, Apple TV switched to ARM and lowered the product's price at the same time. "The original Apple TV sold between 2007 and 2010 was essentially a scaled down Mac, running a modified OS X on an Intel x86 processor and Nvidia CPU. In late 2010, Apple released a " second generation " successor running a version of iOS on its own A4 processor (incorporating the same GPU cores iOS devices use). That shift (involving a complete hardware architecture overhaul) helped Apple to drop the price from $299 to $99." Linux/Unix runs two-thirds of the web servers (W3Techs, September 2014), and of course, does not require Intel chips to run. As more powerful ARM server chips are developed, more competition for Intel Xeon products will be seen in the web server market. Examples are AMD's Seattle Dense Server Product and Qualcomm's new ARM server line: "The interesting bit is that Qualcomm is calling the end of the X86 era to coincide with the rise of the cloud era, where client devices are largely powered by ARM devices and that service providers, carriers, and soon hyper-scale datacenter operators will want to have the tools they use to design and test software on ARM client devices work on devices in the datacenter. They could adapt their tools to X86 processors, or they can hope that someone like Qualcomm creates server chips." "It is also noteworthy that Satya Nadella, CEO at Microsoft, was quoted next in the presentation. Microsoft has a version of Windows running on ARM processors for its smartphones and tablets and is widely expected to port Windows Server to ARM server chips if for nothing else than to be able to deploy it to run its own applications on a hardware platform it controls more tightly." The Intel/Micron (NASDAQ: MU ) joint venture to produce 3D NAND at 20nm is perhaps the best opportunity for rapidly increasing sales going forward into 2016 and 2017. However, the technical difficulties are large and potentially troublesome, at least as far as 2015 delivery goes. The problem occurs because NAND is the most dense memory product ever produced, and all those bits crowded into smaller and smaller space can cause extremely high error rates and subsequent failure rates. Keep in mind that NANDs do wear out - and the narrower the walls between the bit cells, the faster the wear. This is a case where Moore's law run into the laws of physics. In the graph below, I have marked the 40nm line, which is what Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) uses for its 3D NAND, and the 20nm line, where Micron is attempting to go. Note the huge increase in BER (Bit Error Rate) and decrease in endurance at 20nm compared to the 40nm line. And remember, Samsung offers a 10-year warranty on its Pro Series Enterprise 3D - something Intel will have to at least match at 20nm. This is no slam dunk. Intel has spent about $50B in CAPEX in the last 5 years. In 2014, on sales of $55B, it spent about 20% ($11B) on CAPEX and another 20% ($10B) on R&D. If you compare that with Qualcomm, with sales at about half of Intel's ($26.5B), the company only spent $1B on CAPEX last - year less than 4% of sales. However, it did spend the same 20% of revenue on R&D ($5.4B), just like Intel. Qualcomm thinks being fabless is a big advantage to the company, and I agree. "But that is not the only edge that Qualcomm has. As the company's top brass pointed out at its analyst day this week, it will manufacture about 4.5 billion chips in 2014, and it has relationships with 11 different foundries - Samsung, TSMC, GlobalFoundries, SMIC, UMC, Amkor, ASE Group, SPIL, STATS ChipPAC, and UTAC - using over 15 different process technologies." We think semiconductor companies have big CAPEX budgets, but they are nothing compared to the oil industry. According to Stern School of Management at NYU , the oil industry CAPEX was an astounding $346 billion last year. Virtually every major oil company is cutting CAPEX and laying off thousands of employees. Most of the cutbacks are for exploration and development, but computers are everywhere, including in the field, and more importantly, in the back-office. If the average cutback is 20%, that's $70 billion - and since computers are a part of CAPEX, I don't think a few billion dollars in fewer desktops/laptops for the oil companies and their suppliers would be unexpected. That is in addition to the general weakness in the market. Despite management's efforts to tout the Intel brand in retail applications, Intel will never be close to Apple or even Samsung in the retail market. The company is basically a parts manufacturer, albeit one of the most sophisticated and technically advanced. In case anyone has forgotten, Intel attempted to enter the retail market in the early 2000s, and one of its products was a microscope. Things did not work out well then either. The other issue I have stressed in previous articles is the need for management to concentrate and focus on what Intel does best - utilizing the best fabs and best IP in the world to make large numbers of parts that its customers really want to buy. I understand bracelets and drones make for great copy - and if things were going well, I would not mind the distraction, if it was limited. But things are not going well, and it is time for management to concentrate on blocking and tackling. You have Jim Brown in the backfield and an all-Pro line, so run the ball up the middle and keep your opponents defense on the field, wear them out and wear them down. That's how you are going to succeed. Until there is new management or we actually see some success, I think Intel is not a buy. A company with much better defined prospects is Micron, and it sells at 8X PE instead of Intel's 13X. Disclosure: The author owns AMD stock.
