It’s hard to condemn Verizon here, since a plan that includes 100 GB of LTE speed data costs customers $450 per month. The company is, however, the one that signed customers up for unlimited data back when people still talked on their mobile phones, and the important commodity in phones was mobile minutes. Droid Life broke the story, and received clarification from Verizon that the company is targeting users who gobble up “data amounts well in excess of our largest plan size,” which is 100 GB. Verizon has actually brought back unlimited data plans , but using the throttling model, where speeds are slowed down enough that a user can just about check e-mail and post text or low-resolution photos to Facebook, but they can’t, say, post long videos or stream Netflix to their mobile devices.
