I thought this was rude. A neighbor is a financial planner, but she lives down the street and I do not know her, but one day she thought it was okay to come to my house and ask me personal questions about my finances when I was outside doing yard work. I kept telling her that I do not need her services and it was awful! I told her now thanks, but I felt trapped because I live by her and did not want to offend her!
