Apple says EU probe of Irish tax policy could be material | Reuters Related: Stocks, Regulatory News, Markets, Cyclical Consumer Goods April 29 (Reuters) - Apple Inc said the European Commission's investigation into Ireland's tax treatment of multinationals could have a "material" impact if it was determined that Dublin's tax policies represented unfair state aid. Apple said that if the EU's investigations concluded against Ireland, the company could be required to pay past taxes for up to 10 years "reflective of the disallowed state aid." Apple said that as of March 28, it was unable to estimate the impact of having to pay these taxes.
