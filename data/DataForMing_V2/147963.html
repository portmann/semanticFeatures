Intel Inside The iPhone 6s And iPhone 6c - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha New rumor has it that Apple will use an Intel LTE Modem on 50% of its next iPhones. These modems will probably be inside cheaper versions of the iPhone 6s or the iPhone 6c. If the rumor proves true, Apple will be the first OEM to use the new XMM 7360 Category 10 LTE modem. I discussed last March the potential benefit of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) using the new Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) XMM 7360 LTE modem on 30% volume of its next iPhone models. I estimated before that Intel could gain $900 million/year from this blockbuster deal. This projection was based on a modest $15 per modem unit price multiplied by 30% of 200 million iPhone annual sales. Apple spent an average of $33 to use the LTE modems/Wireless components of Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 5s. The modem/wireless components costs more than the A8 processor. Winning an LTE modem supply contract for iPhones is better than selling subsidized x86 Atom chips to Android device manufacturers. My guesstimate is almost similar to the projection of Northland Capital Markets' Gus Richards. Richards' gossip hinted that Apple will use Intel LTE discreet modems in (up to) 50% of its next iPhone handsets. He said this deal will generate $750 million-to-$1.25 billion for Intel's CY 2016 revenue. Apple likely picked the XMM 7360 because it is ready for volume production this year. Qualcomm's Cat.10 MDM9245 modem will allegedly only be available by mid-2016 . Intel could sure use the $900 million from Apple to help it reduce its 9-figure operating losses on mobile chips/products. As a leader in smartphone evolution, Apple's move could also inspire other top vendors like Samsung (OTC: SSNLF ), Lenovo (OTCPK: LNVGY ), and LG Electronics (OTC: LGEAF ) to also use the more powerful XMM 7360 LTE modem. Samsung and LG already used the older Cat. 6 XMM 7260 in some of their Android smartphones. The Cat. 10 XMM 7360 (450Mbps download) is 3x faster than the Cat. 4 Qualcomm MDM9625M LTE (150Mbps). The new iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, and iPhone 6c might get unveiled this coming September 9 . I believe that Apple will likely use Intel's LTE modems on cheaper handsets to attract more budget-conscious buyers in emerging markets like China and India. The massive success of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus created a 'Super Cycle' that might hurt sales of the next high-end iPhone models. Sales of the iPhone tend to be cyclical. Unfortunately, the extreme sales number of the iPhone 6 coupled with the relatively short period between the iPhone 6 and 6s release is not conducive for people to replace their iPhone 6. Even though the iPhone 6s will come with twice the RAM (2GB), Force Touch, and a 60% stronger aluminum 7000 body, majority of buyers in China and India are unlikely to replace their iPhone 6. The high-cost of the iPhone in markets outside the United States compels people to avoid replacing it just months after they bought it. Since iPhone 6s is projected to get lower sales numbers than the iPhone 6, Apple will try to make cheaper versions to attract buyers in price-conscious countries. A cheaper $600 iPhone 6c, with cheaper Intel modems/wireless components, could persuade Chinese buyers who previously could not afford the $862 price tag of the iPhone 6. I opine that Apple would use Intel LTE modems inside lower-ASP iPhones. China and India, the top emerging countries, will likely get Intel-powered iPhone 6s or iPhone 6c models. Maintaining its market share in China is important for Apple because that country already contributes more than 26% of iPhone sales. The huge success of the iPhone 6 meant that China sales have peaked and are already on a downtrend. Only cheaper iPhones might help slow down the decline. Cheaper handsets like the iPhone 6c could also help Apple increase its 2% market share in India. Apple is capable of selling 200 million iPhones every year. If Intel modems could get inside 100 million iPhones, the $1.5 billion annual sales could make up for the contra revenue on tablet application processors. Persuading Samsung, Lenovo, Xiaomi, and Huawei to use the XMM 7360 is also highly desirable. INTC is a Buy. The XMM 7360 LTE modem has a huge market in smartphones. ABI Research estimates that global shipments of LTE handsets will increase from 204 million units to 676 million units this year. I therefore look forward to Intel-made modems getting inside billions of smartphones by 2019. I Know First Research also has a great one-year Buy signal forecast for INTC.
