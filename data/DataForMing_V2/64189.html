Amazon Prime Now Adds 1-Hour Delivery From Local Stores In NYC â€“ Consumerist Because walking outside and going a few blocks to pick up some bread and milk is just too much work sometimes, Amazon is adding one-hour delivery from certain local stores — but only in New York City’s Manhattan borough for now, with plans to expand to other locations that offer Prime Now eventually. Starting today, the Prime Now service will bring deliveries in an hour from a select few stores — D’Agostino grocery stores, Gourmet Garage and Billy’s Bakery — Amazon announced in a press release, only in certain Manhattan neighborhoods at first, with more stores and more locations added in the coming weeks. Next in Manhattan will be Italian marketplace Eataly and Westside Market. â€œWe are launching delivery from local stores through Prime Now in Manhattan today and will add local stores in other cities where we offer Prime Now soon,” Amazon says, with deliveries arriving in an hour or less. Customers will have to use the Prime Now App, which offers deliveries in either two hours for free or one hour for $7.99 in Atlanta, Austin, Baltimore, Brooklyn, Dallas, Manhattan and Miami. Those cities will eventually be added to the local delivery list as well. Click to print (Opens in new window) GM: That Car You Bought? We're Really The Ones Who Own It.
