Disney +2.2%; gives looks at 'Finding Dory,' 'Civil War' - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Apr 13 2016, 17:45 ET | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS ) gained 2.2% and hit its highest point this month on no particular news, but on a day when it rolled out a lengthy clip from animation anchor Finding Dory to wrap a presentation at CinemaCon. The studio showed the first 27 minutes of the sequel to 2003's Finding Nemo, along with a number of recent trailers (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, The BFG, Doctor Strange) and the finished Captain America: Civil War film. Distribution chief Dave Hollis also voiced support for the traditional theatrical window ("Our commitment ... has never, ever been stronger") in the face of window-busting strategies including Sean Parker's The Screening Room, which offers a $50 price to see a movie in-home at the same time as its theatrical release.
