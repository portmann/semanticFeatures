Apple: Thanks For The Stock Boost; Now How Bout More Cash? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple conversations have shifted from "can Apple innovate" to " can Apple pay?". Tim Cook, however, is on record as saying he does not want his company to be a "cash hoarder.". With Cook also saying Apple has more cash than it needs to run the business, shareholders are more than justified to have their hands out. I'm an unabashed Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) shareholder and I have been for a long time. With Apple now back on top of the world after 'being perceived' to have lost its innovative edge, the conversations have shifted. No one's complaining about "Where's the next big thing?" In case you missed it, the "next big thing" now fits perfectly on your wrists. Nor are there questions about Tim Cook's ability to execute, given that Apple nailed every important metric in its fiscal-first quarter reported in January. But with Apple due to release results for its fiscal second-quarter Monday, conversations have shifted from "Can Apple innovate?" to "Can Apple pay?" And I don't mean its mobile payments platform, either. I'm referring to the company's cash chest valued at roughly $180 billion. Essentially, Apple's cash-hoarding mentality persists. Tim Cook, however, is on record as saying he does not want his company to be a " cash hoarder ," implying Apple, which pocketed $18 billion in profits in the January quarter, plans to distribute more of its wealth to shareholders. And with Cook also saying Apple has more cash than it needs to run the business, shareholders are more than justified to have their hands out. How much of that cash will Apple return ? That's now the biggest question. Though Apple is the world's most valuable company, its 47-cent quarterly dividend, yielding 1.46%, ranks it one of the lowest in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. And Apple's yield is below the 2% average of dividend-payers in the S&P 500. Take a look at the chart. Apple's dividend payout ratio of 25.10% in the trailing twelve months is one-fifth of what AT&T (NYSE: T ) pays out. And based on fiscal 2016 earnings estimates of $9.39 per share , Apple's payout ratio is even less impressive, falling below 20%. So, as the largest Dow component (by market cap), Apple should at least seek to rank in the middle of the Dow payers, reaching a payout ratio of, say 55% to 60%. And it can achieve this by raising its dividend to $1.15 per quarter or $4.60 annually. That's not likely, however. Yes, Apple can afford it. But don't hold your breath expecting any company to raise its dividend 144% in one year. What's more realistic would be a 15% to 20% increase, putting the annual payout to around $2.20 per share. It's true this would only hike the payout ratio to around 30%. But it also puts Apple in position to raise it another 15% to 20% in 2016. Add in a potential buyback plan of around $50 to $75 billion, there would (shouldn't be) any complaints. In short, there are plenty of catalysts for Apple stock to appreciate in the quarters ahead. Apple's recent bond sale - presumably - to buyback shares and hike its dividend, seems the most obvious. What I think is more important to consider, though, is how quickly Apple has changed how it is perceived. Cook has been successful at changing some on Wall Street's view that Apple is a slow-growth company. His next task - it seems - is to prove to investors that Apple is not a cash hoarder. This means there is potentially more risk not holding Apple stock ahead of Monday's results than there is holding it, given the monster quarter Apple is expected to deliver. As for Apple being a cash-hoarder, I'm ready to be wrong. Source: Apple: Thanks For The Stock Boost; Now How Bout More Cash? Disclosure: The author is long AAPL.
