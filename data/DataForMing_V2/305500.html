Boeing Co's 737 MAX aircraft took off on its first flight on Friday from wet tarmac at an airport south of Seattle, marking another step toward scheduled delivery to airlines in 2017. A Boeing company video showed the take-off of the plane, the fourth version of the original 737, which made its first flight in 1967. It features new engines from CFM International a joint venture of General Electric (GE.N) and Safran SA of France (SAF.PA). Boeing has sold 3,072 of the planes and is racing to sell more as it battles for market share against rival Airbus's (AIR.PA) competing A320neo, which earlier this month was delivered to its first customer.
