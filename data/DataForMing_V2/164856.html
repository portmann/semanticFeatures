Disney Might Want To Consider Charging A Premium For The Next 'Star Wars' - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" will set box-office records and make a lot of money, but Disney should find ways to maximize the gross. Attaching a premium to ticket prices for the opening weekend might be a consideration -- perhaps people might be willing to spend over $30 for a ticket. Disney shareholders, as well as theater owners, would stand to benefit from considering the opening weekend of this highly-anticipated film a special product all its own. We all know that Star Wars: The Force Awakens is going to be a big hit. It will bring in a huge amount of box-office dollars, but at some point, it's simply going to do whatever it's going to do. There's no way to know exactly how much advertising is necessary to ensure the best return on investment. Yet, Disney (NYSE: DIS ) management, in consultation with the major exhibition chains, should still attempt to figure out ways to maximize the potential of the seventh episode in the Star Wars saga. It's a rather special product, considering the fact that Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, and Mark Hamill are coming back to the big screen to play the roles that made them not only famous, but also helped to usher in a new era of blockbuster cinematic entertainment. Here's one way to do it: charge a higher price for tickets for the first weekend of the film's release. Nevertheless, I stick by the suggestion. Why not? People will be gathering in long lines many hours before the first showings begin. They will be spending a premium already to see the movie just by using their time to wait; to me, this displays a willingness to pay a premium for first-weekend tickets. Considering how much the core fan base is willing to spend on some of the merchandise out there (e.g., that BB-8 thing), I think it makes sense that those same fans would be willing to pay more for the ultimate merchandise: the experience of seeing Awakens very early in its release. What should the ticket prices cost, then? It's an interesting question to me, because, as a Disney shareholder, I would love to know what the company could reasonably charge for those first three days. I'm thinking somewhere around $30 for non-3D/IMAX showings, and between $35 and $40 for the 3D/IMAX screens. The price elasticity would be a concern. It's probable that less people would show up during the first weekend; it would be challenging to hit a record opening. It's also possible that a negative effect on concession sales might occur. This wouldn't be so bad, because studios would not mind getting a percentage of that revenue. Essentially, a high ticket price might transfer some of the popcorn/candy sales over to the studios, on the theory that consumers only have so many dollars to spend and are giving Awakens a lofty valuation. It also might cannibalize retail merchandise sales, something Disney would not be so happy about. However, it might also effectively turn people seeing the film into repeat viewers. The goal of any blockbuster is to have the same consumer see the film multiple times. Charging a lot for tickets helps to ensure that this goal is met, even if many of the people who do show a willingness to allocate more money for the opening-weekend privilege only see Awakens once. Let's think further about this. Let's say a lot of people decide to wait until the next weekend to see the film, or maybe the theaters start to become really full once the cheaper tickets go on sale the Monday after the first weekend. Perhaps that first weekend really becomes Weekend Zero, a very expensive preview showing. There's been a lot of talk about releasing movies at theaters and on home video at the same time, or dating the video release a few weeks after the theatrical debut. If you go with the former approach, then you would have to deal with not only cannibalization concerns, but also with theater companies who are against the idea. However, charging higher ticket prices allows theater owners to get more revenue as well and avoids competition with a home video release. The simultaneous-release approach and the high-ticket-price approach have the same goals: collect more money more quickly. The high-ticket-price approach might be a viable solution. The point is that Awakens is only going to debut once in the marketplace, and it would seem obligatory on the part of Disney and theater owners to do something unique with the release to maximize the gross. Would consumers loudly, angrily balk at the idea of paying $40 for a ticket to Awakens? Most likely. Would they still go and see the film, no matter what they say? Presumably, it might simply concentrate the younger demos who tend to patronize the multiplex on opening weekends; these younger demos might be less price-sensitive, and thus would be the more valuable consumer base for the experiment. Disney and theater owners should attempt to do something, though, so as not to leave too much money on the table. At the very least, there should be no matinee prices or other forms of discounting for the first weekend. Disney owes its shareholders that much. Disclosure: I am/we are long DIS.
