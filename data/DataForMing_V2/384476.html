Verizon turns to shadow workforce amid strike - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha Apr 20 2016, 03:31 ET | About: Verizon Communications (VZ) | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor With the Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) strike going on for more than a week, who's filling in for the company's 40,000 wireline employees? A shadow workforce of managers, accountants, programmers and nonunion staffers is said to be substituting for technicians, repairmen and call center workers. Some of these temps have flown into the Northeast to work. Most are working 12-hour shifts until the strike ends. When a company has a strike on their hands and it affects the many customers that has no stake in the outcome it is the companies responsibility to try and still service the customers and their needs.  If the company does not try and satisfy the needs of the customer, or at least try then why don't they just throw up their hands and concede to the union demands.  Anything short of that means the company does not value the customers.  While I do not know the expertise of the substitute workforce, and there will be statements that will indicate that those workers do not know what they are doing, ( Usually from the supporters of those who favor the Union position )  the company needs to continue their business as they seem fit.  I have no relationship with the activity that is currently underway at Verizon but I do understand the companies position ETF Screener: Search and filter by asset class, strategy, theme, performance, yield, and much more ETF Performance: View ETF performance across key asset classes and investing themes
