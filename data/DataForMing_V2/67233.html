(AAPL) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor With the scope of his design work having gradually expanded over the last few years, Jony Ive (NASDAQ: AAPL ) will now hold the title of Chief Design Officer, says Tim Cook in a company memo. At the same time, Ive will hand over "day-to-day managerial responsibilities" for industrial and UI design to execs Richard Howarth and Alan Dye on July 1. Cook: "Jony’s design responsibilities have expanded from hardware and, more recently, software UI to the look and feel of Apple retail stores, our new campus in Cupertino, product packaging and many other parts of our company ... As Chief Design Officer, Jony will remain responsible for all of our design, focusing entirely on current design projects, new ideas and future initiatives." Three months ago, the New Yorker took a look (in a lengthy profile piece) at Ive's role in crafting both the design and UI of the Apple Watch. SA has a really cool feature, it's called I don't care, so you can exercise the option of not reading articles that you could care less about.  But on the other hand, many of us die-hard AAPL followers like to stay abreast of the corporate changes in the largest marcap company in the world and want to know what goes on in all aspects the might affect the companies designs, but especially it's profitability etc... but that's just the way shareholders behave normally.  Just a thought for you. What does it have to do with whether or not I recognize some genius at Apple? My real question is what material impact this announcement makes on Apple stock price or its overall performance. Well, if you still do not get it, here's the answer - none whatsoever! You should focus on what really matters. This way you will make more money. This announcement is a complete non-event. Maybe you should stick to not making comments on threads that you have no interest in and take the SA ignore feature.  I know that will be my approach to your comments from now on.  OUT KH Ive is bored of the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch etc. Cook is trying to give him reasons for staying. However, if boredom is the reason, handing over day to day management seems to open the gate to even more boredom! Ah ... from the article ... "Among those other tasks, Ive says, is a focus on the design of Appleâ€™s retail stores and new campus [including furnishings]." Hmm, Chief Design Officer...sounds very regal and important. To Sir Chief Design Officer Jony Ive! Suddenly my respect for him increased 10 fold because of the new title. How in the world can Ive be bored being the chief designer of the most successful and innovative company in the world. This is a nice promotion recognizing Mr. Ive's importance and contribution to the company.  It elevates him from his previous status as Senior Vice President to Chief Design Officer.  I would say that it is well deserved and that he is just as instrumental to the company as the Chief Operations Officer for instance. APPLE INC. would be nowhere without the genius of Sir Jony Ive's designs & creations, that over the years has made Apple, what Apple is today!  Sir Jony Ive is the next Steve Jobs, May he rest in peace! chief design officer without management responsibilities. coded talk for he knows what he wants but not how to get there Ive doesn't know how to lead, which is why there have been such surprising QC issues with the software in the past two years. Even the hardware has become unfocused. And why he has been relieved of managerial duties. He and Jobs were such a great team. It's very sad that Jobs has died. Jobs got the best out of him. Cook, for all his operational strengths, isn't blessed with the same leadership. Ive runs the top design team the world has ever known.  He was more responsible for designing tbe iPhone than Jobs was, a co-creator.  When Jony is in charge you know every Apple product will be gorgeous.  But we already knew that. Another big promotion Apple has not yet announced is Jimmy Iovine as head of media and marketing. THis includes video, music, advertising and more.  Jimmy has been one of the smartest guys in Hollywood and has no doubt been busy cutting big first-run content deals for the Apple TV and Beats Streaming services upgrades which will soon be announced. Keeping Great Talent on your team is a Major instrument of success for any company. When that talent is arguably genius then even more so. This is another chess move in a very long game of chess. Deploy your talent where it can have the biggest impact. Maybe Ive managing people is not putting him in the best place for biggest impact. Many people can manage people. Not many people have the visionary skill set and experience as Ive. I like the move.
