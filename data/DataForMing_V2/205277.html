ETF Hub Oct 15 2015, 12:26 ET | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor Looking to halt ongoing share losses to Gmail (or at least slow them), Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) has overhauled its iOS/Android Mail apps. New features include a smarter search engine that makes suggestions based on queries and message content, the ability to fully manage Hotmail, Outlook.com, and AOL.com e-mail accounts, and social media content integration for contact profiles. Getting the most attention is Yahoo Account Key, a feature that lets users login without a password by linking their Yahoo account to a mobile device, and approving/denying logins via push notifications sent to the device. Yahoo argues Account Key is more secure than passwords, and eliminates the possibility of a user being unable to logic due to forgetting his/her password. comScore estimates Yahoo Mail had 71M U.S. users as of August, down from 96M two years earlier. Over the same time, Gmail's U.S. base, strengthened by the pre-installing of a Gmail app on devices using Google's version of Android, is believed to have grown to 135M from 96M.
