Will Invensense Turn Things Around? - InvenSense (NYSE:INVN) | Seeking Alpha Invensense landed the big Apple, but it came with a severe price of gross margin compression that will take years for the company to recover from. Shares of Invensense are down 47% YTD and over 65% in the last 12 months and are rapidly approaching lows reached in 2011 right after the companyâ€™s IPO. Shares of Invensnese are currently on a free-fall with no obvious end in sight and will likely continue falling until buyers lend support or shorts look to cover. Shares of Invensense (NYSE: INVN ) are down 47% YTD and over 65% in the last 12 months and are rapidly approaching lows reached in 2011 following the company's IPO. Last year I came out with an aggressive price target on Invensense ahead of the company landing product inside the iPhone 6. Invensense landed the big Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), but it came with a severe price of gross margin compression that will take years for the company to recover from. Invensense's gross margin had been hovering around 50% for quite some time. The math seemed simple, add in over 150m plus annual unit sales to Apple and Invensense would be well on their way to earning well over $1 per share. Unfortunately, we learned quite quickly that the Apple business has resulted in a catastrophic blow to Invensense margins pushing gross margins from 50% to 45% with no signs of a recovery. A best-case scenario is that a year from now Invensense gross margins might find a way to move up from 45%, but I wouldn't bet on it. Invensense has some new products in the pipeline including drones, gaming and automotive applications and wearables, but they won't be able to move the gross margin needle upward for quite some time. Apple and Samsung accounted for 61% of Invensense revenue during the most recent quarter and there is no other company or product in the world that can provide Invensense with the top line growth required to offset stable to declining gross margins. Additionally, new products in the pipeline will take years to come to fruition so any hopes that product mix will improve gross margins will take several years at best. The other issue facing shareholders is economic weakness. Invensense did not see any troubled waters ahead from China during its recent conference call, but any softness outside of Apple and Samsung will result in additional gross margin compression and slower top line growth. Long-term investors in Invensense that continue to hold should not expect a recovery above $17.50 for at least 12 to 24 months. The current fiscal year will likely disappoint in terms of slowing top line growth and continued decline in gross margins without any near-term visibility towards improvement. Short-term investors and traders could look to trade this volatile stock, but the most recent 9-month trading range between $12.50 and $17.50 has completely broken down. Shares of Invensnese are currently on a free-fall with no obvious end in sight and will likely continue falling until buyers lend support or shorts look to cover. I'm staying on the sidelines and might place a buy order over the coming weeks after the dust settles and shares begin to stabilize.
