Netflix: Street Applauds Disastrous Financial Results - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Despite large nominal gains in subscribers, Netflix's financial picture continues to deteriorate. Content costs continue to skyrocket, and operating expense trends are troubling. Cash flows paint a clear picture of financial difficulties despite revenue gains. Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) released Q1-15 results Wednesday, and preliminary market results are very positive. I released an extensive analysis of troubling trends and a persistent "spin factor" on NFLX earlier Wednesday, which will be publicly released to non-PRO subscribers tomorrow. I've been a long-term bear, since late 2010, of NFLX, so it's easy to get trapped with "Bear Goggles" and miss the front running and obvious thesis. However, based on the fundamental trends that I've analyzed, NFLX seems to be headed in the wrong direction on a financial basis, and I believe Q1-15 is the worst quarter in (streaming) company history since Q3-11. The last time financial results were this bad, NFLX tumbled 40%. Financial results are bad - that doesn't make sense right? Netflix posted record revenues, record subscribers, and even turned a "profit" during strong international expansion. What's not to love? Please see below for a recap of troubling trends, updated for the Q1-15 results. Please note, I do NOT have accurate numbers on 1-year content liabilities, and will not have these figures until the 10-Q is uploaded to the SEC website (typically by Friday). I am using the $9.8B in total content liabilities figure as reported in the most recent shareholder letter . All of my numbers come directly from Netflix's most recent Excel sheet . The most recent growth figures, although still impressive as an unaccompanied headline, are the lowest in streaming company history. Even with enormous international expansion, worldwide subscriber growth is now below 30% (y/y), with an obvious downward trend line. This is a company with P/E ratios in the triple digits, with growth of under 30%. Moreover, Netflix is becoming increasingly dependent upon international subscribers in an environment which has proven to be difficult on a profitability basis. This is hardly a "new" or niche venture, as international subscribers now make up nearly one-third of total streamers. Netflix might be posting large (nominal) subscriber gains, but, as shown above, the percentage gains are less impressive. Even scarier is the massive content spend as NFLX continues to pile huge future commitments by securing premium content through providers such as Disney (NYSE: DIS ) and Lions Gate (NYSE: LGF ) while also procuring custom content such as House of Cards and Orange Is the New Black. This growth in content commitment has continually outpaced revenue growth, and the recent gap is the largest in recent company history. This is an extremely dangerous trend that has NFLX placed on risky ground. Growth is slowing while content liabilities are exploding. Subscribers can quit on any given month while Netflix is still liable for their payments. This is further proof that the "virtuous cycle" is a total fantasy. Perhaps an even worse trend is the growth in non-content expenses (marketing, development, and corporate) versus revenues. While Netflix bulls will continually tout "economies of scale," the proof is crystal clear - Netflix must pay higher costs each quarter in order to keep growth coming. The last three quarters have been the worst trending in streaming company history. This discussion is covered in more detail in my previous analysis, but NFLX is in trouble when it comes to cash flows. The income statement is a misdirection on the current financial realities. What follows is a breakdown of NFLX's cash flows with irrelevant/misleading investment gains removed and working capital shifts separately listed. Note that Netflix's cash flows are trending in an obviously horrendous direction, and that Q1-15 is worse than the entire year of 2014. If this trend continues, NFLX could find itself on the brink of financial ruin. I don't have an honest answer for you. Even the news seems rather muted as earnings fell below expectations . The only positive news I see is that paid subscriber growth was a nominal 5.1M additions. This number sounds impressive in isolation, but it represents the slowest growth in streaming company history. Coupled with the aforementioned financial issues, there's nothing to applaud, and plenty to scorn. I also urge readers to check out the bullish arguments for Netflix, the most recent comprehensive argument of which was posted by James Godbout on 7 April 2015. Take the time to review the income statements, peruse the balance sheet, and examine the timing of debt issuances. Read all you can find about Netflix and then come to your own, informed, opinion. Please also read my coverage submitted yesterday. I urge all interested readers to also read my early 2014 article in which I refute Icahn's thesis for owning Netflix. There's 6-7 pages of content there, of which most is relevant over a year later. I am not an investment adviser, just a market commentator sharing my thoughts. I look forward to a lively discussion below. If I'm missing the obvious "forest for the trees," please feel free to correct me. If the market is responding the way it is, to what I see as abysmal business results, I must be missing something! Based on what I perceived as clear trends, I purchased weekly options to play what I believed would be a disastrous earnings report. I got the disastrous earnings, but not the market reaction. If the stock price holds up, I plan to purchase a massive stake in both May puts and January 2016 puts. I believe Netflix is one of the most mispriced equities on Wall Street today.
