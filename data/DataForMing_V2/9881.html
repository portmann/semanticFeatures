A Product Overview of the iPhone 6: Is It Really Worth It? - Len Penzo dot Com Just how popular is the iPhone with United States teenagers? In a recent survey of 7500 teens, 61% said they owned an Apple phone. In another survey of iPhone usage, by Chitika Insights , they looked at the use of iPhones by state. They found that states with the highest percentage of college graduates also had a higher rate of iPhone use; Alaska, Montana, Kansas, New York, Mississippi, and Vermont all had iPhone usage between 55% and 65%. So the iPhone is here to stay. Apple’s newest addition to the family, the iPhone 6, offers many new features that make it easier to use, more powerful, and more efficient. Here is a brief summary: The iPhone 6 comes in three colors: gold, silver, and gray. Basic storage capacity starts at 16GB, with increased capacity of 64GB or even 128GB. The iPhone6 weighs a mere 4.55 ounces, and it’s compact too at just 5.44 inches tall by 2.64 inches wide. The display is 4.7 inches diagonal, and offers the following features: iOS 8 comes with Siri, a virtual assistant that allows you to operate your phone hands-free. When operating with a trustworthy carrier, you also get family sharing, iCloud drive, iTunes radio, spotlight search, and a notification center. AirDrop allows you to share videos and photos to other iPhone users who are nearby. AirPlay is a wireless streaming feature to your HDTV from your phone. CarPlay is the same kind of feature, only for your phone. Although it’s only available in newer cars, soon it will be standard. To fully utilize your phone and all its operating system has to offer, you’ll need an iPhone 6 with a reliable network to ensure constant access to these incredible features. The camera on the iPhone 6 has all of the best features of the previous iPhones, such as auto image stabilization, exposure control, a f/2.2 aperture, the True Tone flash, and burst mode. You can tap to focus, geotag your photo, and have a timer mode. It also offers autofocus with focus pixels ; this allows you to take pictures when your subject is moving. The iSight also features better tone mapping for color and detail retention. Your photos will look much better, especially in shadowed conditions. When recording video, Apple has upgraded the components in the iSight for better image stabilization. Small movements of your phone won’t affect the quality as much as it did in the past. Apple has always packed in many sensors into its electronic devices. The iPhone 6 introduces a barometer to this growing list that tracks your altitude. The sleep/wake button is on the right hand side of the phone — instead of the top — offers more flexibility in one-handed use. It has a feature called “reachability:” Just tap twice on the home button, and the buttons on the top of the phone drop down to the bottom of the screen. Near Field Communications (NFC) is a technology that allows small bits of data to be passed between two devices and is the secret to the Apple Pay Technology. Apple included the NFC chip so that you can utilize Apple Pay in places that are accepting it. Although it’s still catching on, it’s a great idea that means you don’t have to keep up with multiple debit cards in your wallet. The iPhone 6 is the slimmest phone Apple has ever produced. It offers up to 14 hours of talk time on 3G, with 250 hours of standby time on one full charge. Twenty-nine apps come preinstalled, with many other apps available to download through the iTunes store. This version of the iPhone offers many features that you won’t find with any other smartphone.
