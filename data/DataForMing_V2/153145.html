ETF Hub Aug 18 2015, 19:54 ET | About: Verizon Communications (VZ) | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) led in overall network performance rankings again, according to the first-half report by analytics firm RootMetrics, though Sprint's network investments may be paying off. Across the board, the results were similar to the last few analyses by the firm. In nationwide performance tests, Verizon took five wins to AT&T's (NYSE: T ) one. In state-by-state looks, Verizon grabbed 253 wins/ties, to AT&T's 95. Sprint (NYSE: S ) took 25 and T-Mobile (NYSE: TMUS ) zero. Metro areas show more variation, but Verizon prevailed overall there too, with 512 wins/ties. AT&T logged 441, T-Mobile 221, and Sprint 180. The tests resulted in a RootScore of 94.5 for Verizon, followed by AT&T's 91.8. Sprint finished third with 87.5, and T-Mobile brought up the rear there, with 82. In the first half of 2014, T-Mobile was third in those rankings to Sprint's fourth place. I have had T-Mobile for 7 or 8 years in two different states have never had trouble with my phone or data network. I dont have a large number of data points however. I will say that I had Sprint before that and also had very few problems.
