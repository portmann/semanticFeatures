Apple: The One Item Nobody Is Mentioning - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha US Dollar has weakened since Apple's July earnings report. Higher pricing in certain markets can boost average selling prices. In one week we'll get an earnings report from Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). There are many key items investors are discussing, from sales of the new Watch to how this year's iPhone launch timeline will impact quarterly sales. We've also seen a ton of discussion on the growth slowdown in China and how it will impact one of Apple's biggest markets. But in all of this discussion, one key item has not received much coverage, and it is one that probably will have a large impact on the company's results. I'm talking about the impact of currencies, which has been a significant headwind for Apple and many other US firms over the past year. The strengthening in the dollar has knocked off several percentage points of revenue growth for Apple, which translates into a couple of billion dollars each quarter. The good news for Apple is that the US dollar currency index ("DCI") has weakened a couple of percent since the company's Q3 report in July. We also are getting to the point where year over year comparisons are starting to improve quite significantly, as seen in the chart below. *Future values based on current DCI value of $94.93. Earlier this year, the DCI's year over year increase was around 20% for a number of months, approaching 23% at its peak. At the end of September 2015, the increase was down to 12.57%, and we could be under 6% by the end of this calendar year if the DCI stays where it is now. By early 2016, the DCI could be flat over its prior year period value, which will make comparisons to prior year quarters easier for Apple. Additionally, it could help Apple's report next week, given the quarter's guidance was based on currency rates back in July (and any potential hedges). Now I mentioned back in March that Apple had reportedly raised prices on a number of its products around the globe to help combat the issue of a strengthening dollar. From the Mac line to the iPhone, some countries saw price increases of 10-20% or more, which at that time mirrored the rise in the DCI. With the dollar's recent weakness and comparisons getting a little better, that now means that any price raises could provide a nice tailwind to Apple's results. To show how this all works out, let's take a look at my most recent Apple article where I discussed the iPhone's sales impact in India . Pre-bookings for this year's phone were reportedly a bit soft, with the main concern from buyers being high prices. According to some retail executives, this year's entry level phone cost 8,500 Rupees more than last year's launch price. At current exchange rates, that works out to about $131 a phone. An iPhone going for $649 in the United States currently was fetching roughly $949 in India, a dramatic price difference. In last year's December-ending fiscal Q1 period , Apple reported an average selling price of $687.30 for the iPhone. Price increases around the globe could help that number a little this year. Apple also is likely to see some help from higher storage capacity models of the phone, since the base model 16GB version is not consumer friendly. With a large operating system and all of the apps that everyone likes to run, you really need to pay up for the more expensive versions, and a sizable chunk of that premium goes directly to Apple's bottom line. Depending on supply of new phones and the sales mix, it would not shock me if the average sales price of the iPhone in the December quarter topped $700. Even if unit sales for the phone are flat, topping that key ASP on roughly 75 million phones could mean an extra $1 billion or so in quarterly revenues. Why is this important for investors? Well, as you will see in the chart below, analyst estimates for fiscal Q1 revenues have been rising in recent weeks. After the July earnings report, the average forecast dipped a little as the September ending Q4 guidance seemed a bit light. However, the turning point basically was the launch of the newest iPhone, and the average revenue estimate is now approaching $77 billion. That's 3.2% growth over the prior year period, which was Apple's highest sales quarter ever. While the company will have help from new products/services like the Watch and Music, we could see revenue declines from the iPad and perhaps the Mac. This is why the iPhone is so critical, beyond the fact that it represents about 2/3 of Apple's business. (Source: Yahoo! Finance analyst estimates page) For investors looking at Apple shares, every small decline in the US dollar is a net positive for Apple. Perhaps if the dollar continues to weaken, Apple may reduce global prices sometime in 2016, but I don't see that happening in the next couple of weeks. Strong iPhone average selling prices will be needed as analyst revenue forecasts are on the rise. As DCI year over year comparisons get much softer in early 2016, Apple's quarterly results will start to look better and better, which will ease potential concerns over slowing revenue and earnings growth. A weakening dollar is a potential tailwind that could propel Apple shares to a new all-time high, and further weakness in this key currency would provide a reason to accumulate Apple shares.
