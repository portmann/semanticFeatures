Ford: Stepping Up Its Game In This Key Growth Market - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha India will become the third-largest auto market in the world in the next 15 years, driven by growth in the SUV segment that Ford is now targeting. Ford has already tasted success in India’s SUV market with the EcoSport, and it is now looking to step up its game with a luxury SUV – the Endeavour. Ford will price the Endeavour competitively as compared to the Toyota Fortuner, the market leader, which will help it attract more buyers as it is a newer-generation model. Ford has included several new features in the Endeavour as compared to rivals, while its engine carries superior torque and power figures, indicating that it has got the right product. Car sales in India , which is the world's fifth-largest car market, have increased for nine consecutive months until July. Sales in India rose 17.47% from 137,922 units last year to 162,000 units this July, according to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers. Total passenger vehicle sales, including cars, utility vehicles, and vans also increased 11.43% to 222,368 vehicles in July. This clearly indicates that India's car market is growing at an impressive pace, but American automaker Ford (NYSE: F ) has been unable to make the most of this opportunity. In July, Ford's sales in India dropped almost 43% on a year-over-year basis, as its market share slipped just under 2%. Overall, India is a small market for Ford, as the company sold only 154,121 vehicles over here last year, while its global sales were 6.3 million units. Thus, it is evident that India contributes a very small share to Ford's overall sales. Now, you might be thinking why I'm worried about the company's weak performance in the relatively small market. Well, this is because India is on track to become the third-biggest auto market after the U.S. and China, hitting 6 million units in annual sales by 2020. Additionally, by 2030, auto sales in India are slated to hit a run rate of 10 million units annually as shown below. The fast pace of growth in this particular market is the reason why I believe Ford needs to step up its game in this market, or it might miss out on a key growth opportunity. More specifically, in order to improve its share in India, Ford needs to focus on certain growth hotspots, such as the SUV market. The SUV segment, in particular, is showing robust growth in India. India is now one of the fastest growing markets for SUVs. As a percentage of sales, SUVs now command over 30% of total luxury vehicles sold in India. Since roads in India are usually not up to the mark as compared to international standards, demand for SUVs is rising as they are equipped with all-wheel-drive capabilities, while offering comfort at the same time. This is the reason why Ford's EcoSport compact SUV became a rage in the country when it was launched two years ago. This is because, in the last 3-4 years, the compact SUV segment in India has grown at a rate of 30%-40% as compared to the 15% growth of the overall UV market. Ford's EcoSport has been the trendsetter in this segment, selling 200,000 units in just two years. Thus, Ford has hit the ground running in the SUV segment in India, but now it is looking to step up its game with the Ford Endeavour. In a bid to increase its market share in India, Ford has lined up multiple launches in the country. As a part of this plan, the company will bring in the new-generation model of the Ford Endeavour SUV in India. The new Endeavour is expected to be more upmarket than its predecessor, and is expected to fall in the price bracket of INR 22-27 lakhs (around $38,000) in India. Ford has started production of the new Endeavour in Thailand at its Auto-Alliance-Thailand (AAT) manufacturing unit in Rayong. The outgoing Endeavour is also manufactured from the same facility and exported to other countries as completely-knocked-down kits. This means that the production cost of the new generation model should not be much higher as compared to the outgoing model as they share the same manufacturing platform. As a result, it is likely that this model will have a positive impact on Ford's margins in the country since the outgoing Endeavour is priced at around $34,000 in India at the mid-point. Ford has been able to increase the premium on this car by giving it a new look, along with some other major changes to improve the ride and handling package. For instance, Ford has now included a new independent coil-spring suspension layout at the rear as compared to a leaf spring setup in the outgoing car. Additionally, the company has included a new terrain management system (TMS), which will allow the driver to choose from pre-adjusted settings to enhance safety and performance in any driving scenario. As a result, Ford's new full-size SUV for India is more comfortable and capable as compared to the outgoing generation. Ford, however, will face stiff competition from the likes of the Toyota (NYSE: TM ) Fortuner, the Honda (NYSE: HMC ) CR-V, the Isuzu ( OTCPK:ISUZY ) MU7, the Mitsubishi ( OTCPK:MMTOF ) Pajero , and the Ssangyong Rexton in the SUV segment. However, an advantage that the Endeavour has as compared to its biggest rival, the Fortuner, is in terms of power. The Endeavour's 3.2-liter engine will help the car generate 197 BHP of power, which is greater than the Fortuner's 171 BHP. Additionally, the current generation Fortuner in India costs the same as the Endeavour, and this puts Ford at an advantage. I'm saying this because the Fortuner is an older generation model as compared to the Endeavour, generates less power, and comes loaded with a lot of technologies. Thus, I won't be surprised if the Endeavour outpaces the Fortuner in the Indian SUV market once it is launched. Ford is accelerating its product development for India. After launching the Figo Aspire to tap the fast-growing compact sedan segment, the company is now looking to tap the premium segment as well with the Endeavour SUV. Given the features that Ford has included in the Endeavour, it should be able to strike a chord with SUV buyers in India. Since the overall Indian car market is growing at a good pace, driven by increasing demand for SUVs, Ford is focusing in the right direction to improve its share in this market. This is a smart move from Ford, since India's car market is expected to grow in leaps and bounds in the future as the disposable income of people increases. As India is on track to become the third-biggest car market globally, Ford's moves to tap growth in this particular market will allow it to improve its overall financial performance in the long run.
