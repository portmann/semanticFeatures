Verizon Has No Earnings Risk - Cramer's Lightning Round (7/8/15) | Seeking Alpha Jul.  9, 2015  6:31 AM ET  |  Includes: AAL , AMBA , BRCM , CAT , FL , FRC , IXYS , LCI , VZ by: SA Editor Mohit Manghnani Foot Locker is an incredible company and should be bought on a decline. Don't buy bank stocks that are up already. Caterpillar is still too high to buy. Lannett (NYSE: LCI ): "It's an acquiring pharmaceutical company and those stocks are all being hit right now. I think you need to wait three or four days into the decline and then I would do some buying because I agree with you. Fast growing and doing the right stuff." Foot Locker (NYSE: FL ): "This is the kind of stock that I pray for a decline in. Why? Because it hit an all-time high today and it is doing incredibly well." Cramer recommends buying the stocks only after it comes down. Verizon (NYSE: VZ ): "Verizon yields 4.75%. These stocks that yield 4.75-5% don't have earnings risk, and they are okay to buy because interest rates are going down." First Republic Bank (NYSE: FRC ): Cramer is not recommending any banks that are up already. He suggested waiting till the quarterly results are out. IXYS Corp (NASDAQ: IXYS ): "The chip industry is coming down pretty hard. I like Ambarella (NASDAQ: AMBA ) but I see that one getting hammered. I would be very careful here." American Airlines (NASDAQ: AAL ): Cramer would buy airlines only after the monthly numbers are out and the estimates get cut. Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT ): The stock is still too high. Cramer wants the stock to get back to $78 to be good to buy, as the 3.75% yield is not enough to save it.
