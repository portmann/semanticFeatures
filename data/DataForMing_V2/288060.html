Amazon To Open Fifth On-Campus, Offline Location At University Of Pennsylvania â€“ Consumerist Whoops! It looks like portions of our site are being blocked! Check your browser settings or contact your network administrator. This is Amazon’s store at Purdue, but with the counter and lockers, the Penn version is the same idea. Amazon has spent the last year expanding its challenge to the existence of college bookstores, opening pickup locations on campuses scattered across the country. There, students can pick up things that they ordered on Amazon, and… that’s about it. A newÂ pickup point at the University of Pennsylvania will also offer study and collaboration space for student use, and will provide same-day or next-day pickup for members ofÂ Amazon Student or Amazon Prime. The first Amazon store was at Purdue University , and since then they’ve expanded to UMass Amherst , UC Santa Barbara (Isla Vista) , and the University of Cincinnati . Amazon also has a real-life bookstore in Seattle , and has more campus-based pickup locations planned at UC Davis and UC Berkeley. Placing an Amazon pickup point withÂ study space right on campus is a handy advertisement for Amazon, but also has an added bonus for the university: letting students and faculty pick up their own darn packages alleviates pressure on campus mail rooms. E-commerce is creating logistical nightmares for campus mail services and apartment complexes . “The preference by todayâ€™s students for on-line shopping has led to a significant increase in deliveries. When we looked closely at the shipping activity, we discovered that almost half of all packages delivered to Penn student mail rooms were from Amazon,” Marie Witt, the Vice President of Business Services at Penn, explained in a statement.
