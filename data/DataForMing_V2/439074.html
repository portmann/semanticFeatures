SunTrust: Snapchat minor but growing threat to Facebook, Twitter - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Jun 21 2016, 15:11 ET | About: Facebook (FB) | By: Stephen Alpher , SA News Editor Still a bull on Facebook ( FB +0.6%), SunTrust's Bob Peck says Snapchat continues to steal away users. "We think that Snapchat (Private: CHAT ) is evolving beyond just ‘another social media platform’ and could be headed to be the first ‘social augmented reality platform’ (SARP),” he says. Snapchat, he says, expands social sharing beyond just selfies and "has brought back the fun in picture taking that can be lacking on other platforms which may be more curated, showing an image of perfection." He notes Snapchat's "daily active users" have surpassed that of Twitter ( TWTR -0.3%), but at 150M still remain well below the 1B-plus of Facebook. The threat to Facebook and Instagram is minimal in the short run, but the trend, he says, is worth monitoring, particularly as Instagram has seen user growth slow of late. I just wrote another response to a bs lawsuit headline. I am starting to wonder why SA is FILL of "Shorties Shoveling Shit." can someone point me to a positive LONG article? (other than the poorly written FB Will Grow Value With New Products stinker)? Snapchat is for my 14-year-old kid and it will pass as a fad like Facebook did on that generation, not even close to Twitter Who is for everyone worldwide. Twitter is like a drivers license to a 16-year-old, ones you are in your late 20s you will use Twitter and will leave all the other childish social media fads Further, I believe the platform will be difficult to monetize and user growth will eventually stall out (similar to TWTR).
