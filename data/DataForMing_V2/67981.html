Facebook Will Include Critics’ Reviews On “Select” Restaurant Pages â€“ Consumerist In what appears to be another effort to keep its users inside the social media site’s loving embrace, Facebook is reportedly going to include critics’ reviews of restaurants on the pages of “select” establishments in the United States. According to a report from The Verge , those reviews will now show up alongside reviews left by friends on Facebook when you search for restaurants on the site and, ostensibly, its mobile app. It’s part of a partnership with Bon Appetit, Conde Nast Traveler, Eater.com, New York Magazine and the San Francisco Chronicle. That might indicate that the pilot project will be taking place in at least San Francisco and New York. “Since reviews are such an important part of helping people make informed decisions about what to do locally, we’re excited to be incorporating a new way for people to use Facebook to find the best real-world experiences,” a Facebook spokeswoman told The Verge. There doesn’t appear to be an official announcement of the venture by Facebook yet, or details about whether or not restaurants will be allowed to curate which reviews show up on their pages.
