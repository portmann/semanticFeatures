How Much More Can Netflix Really Charge Customers? - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Netflix is due to report Q1 2015 earnings next Wednesday, April 15, 2015. During FY 2014, Netflix consistently beat top and bottom YoY numbers, while also adding more members than they did in FY 2013. Current Netflix naysayers are still focused on the wrong metrics when judging Netflix, its current valuation, and its future growth potential. Netflix has learned from their 2011 mistakes by successfully raising membership prices in FY 2014. In July of 2011, Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) announced to their 24 million members worldwide that they were no longer going to be offering unlimited plans that include both their streaming and DVDs-by-mail services for one low price. Instead, Netflix said that, while unlimited streaming would continue at $7.99 per month, customers would need to shell out another $7.99 if they also wanted unlimited DVDs. After hovering around $300 per share in mid-2011, the stock ended the year at around $70 per share - losing over three-fourths of its market value in the span of 6 months. The company's controversial Qwikster.com creation, a proposed separate site to run the company's DVDs-by-mail, only accelerated the stock's 2011 tumble. Almost a year ago in May of 2014, Netflix increased prices for its most popular streaming plan from $7.99 to $8.99. Unlike in 2011 where the stock and the company's subscriber growth drastically fell, this plan has paid off so far. The stock, while still sporadic historically, has climbed out of the hole it created in 2012, and has since provided shareholder returns that exceed 400%. Today, Netflix has more members than ever, while top and bottom line numbers continue to rise quarterly. But what is stopping Netflix from raising prices even higher? More importantly, how much higher can Netflix really go in terms of their membership pricing? Netflix has become a global internet TV network juggernaut offering movies and TV shows commercial-free across 50 countries with long-term goals to reach 200 countries - all at a flat monthly fee. During their fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, revenues rose 26.3% to $1.49 billion, while net income surged 72.2% to $83.4 million. Below is a chart showing how Netflix has grown its top and bottom lines the past two years. For the year, Netflix saw revenues climb 25.8% to $5.5 billion, while net income accelerated over 137% to $266.8 million. The company was able to maintain positive subscriber growth by adding 13.0 million new members in 2014, up from the 11.1 million added in 2013. Netflix now has 57.4 million members. Despite the shift to streaming by Netflix customers overall, the DVDs-by-mail service is still reaching 5.8 million members in the U.S. Management's current outlook for fiscal 2015 include: growing to 61.4 million members globally, launching Netflix in Australia and New Zealand markets, and launching over 320 hours of original programming, which includes the hit series House of Cards. Too many people are still fixated on the doom of Netflix, while continually underestimating the company's long-term prospects. Recent discussions of Netflix appear to revolve around the company's history of losing content providers due to rising content costs (STARZ in 2012 and Warner Bros., MGM, and Universal in 2013), how these rising costs are undermining the company's revenue growth, the slowing of subscriber growth, weaker margins, stronger competition, and fears on Netflix's market valuation. First of all, losing content providers isn't exactly a negative for Netflix. Sure, they could have paid up more or even overpaid to keep providers like STARZ or Warner Bros., but at what cost? Is keeping a content license worthwhile if it hurts the bottom line? Additionally, Netflix has since increased its focus on creating more of its own content. As stated in their recent fourth quarter conference call , the main perk behind creating more original content is the higher upfront expense characteristics as opposed to paying a more out over the life of a licensing deal - regardless of whether the titles under a particular license are truly adding the same value to the company's library in its fifth year as in its first year. As we can see from the chart above, total subscribers in the streaming segment have steadily increased in a linear fashion. As more customers make the switch from DVDs-by-mail to streaming, I expect this trend to continue, if not accelerate at some point. What Netflix bears seem to misunderstand is that Netflix subscriber counts is approaching a simple case of law of large numbers. What this means is that the total subscriber count can steadily grow for several more years. But, to maintain the pace of the growth today as it was five years ago is mathematically impossible. Essentially, the rate of growth going from 10 million members to 20 million members is a lot higher than going from 50 million members to 60 million. Next, we have the idea of weaker or weakening margins as a result of higher content costs and other rising expenses. From the chart below, it looks like Netflix is dealing with rising margins quite well. As stated in the company's 2014 Annual Report SEC filing, growth in paid memberships and revenues continued to outpace content and marketing spending. I will discuss Netflix's stronger competition and high valuation later in this article. Why The Time Is Now To Increase Prices Going back to 2011, there is a big misconception on why the proposed price increase faced so much backlash. It wasn't exactly the price increase that angered so many customers as much as it was the unnecessary split of two separate services. Historically, customers don't want to be forced to pay double for what essentially is the same product, but they definitely don't want to have to pay more for separate products across separate channels (Qwikster.com). This is basically what made the 2014 price increase so successful for the company as shown on the table below. While average monthly domestic revenues per member increased by 2% going from $7.97 to $8.14 from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2014, contribution margins jumped 4.6% to 27.3%. This table further puts to rest statements made on the company's increased cost of revenues affecting its profitability. While costs of revenues are well-beyond the $2 billion mark annually, Netflix still has been able to grow its top and bottom lines. What the above chart also suggests is that Netflix can and should increase prices again this year. Netflix is likely to face less backlash, if any, given the increased options available to consumers today that were unavailable in 2011 and 2014 as shown on the table below. The price of a Netflix membership, even with last year's price increase, still looks like a bargain when compared to other options in the space. Additionally, not shown on the table is the rise in movie ticket prices not including concessions (which hit an all-time yearly high of $8.17 in 2014), the expensive costs to purchase a single season of a favorite TV series, the growing trend of customers not wishing to own either DVDs or Blu-Rays in favor of streaming everything they want to watch, and the swelling prices of cable TV packages where customers are becoming disgruntled over the package prices, the channel lineups, or both. Going back to Netflix's stronger competition, does Netflix really have any direct competitors to begin with? Netflix bears seem to think so and their list looks similar to my chart above. However, I have called my chart simply 'options available'. When it comes to person's choice for lunch, is pizza really a direct competitor to steak? That is where Netflix's higher valuation begins to come into play. You can't just compare library counts and declare a clear winner. Library counts in this space is almost meaningless. Quality and content is king. A provider can easily build a library of 100,000+ titles if they are all titles no one wants to see. However, as of today, it is hard to dispute that Netflix doesn't have the most robust library out of all the streaming services. More importantly, the potential for Netflix to continue to build the quality and originality of its library, while also building its membership base lays the foundation to its high stock valuation. Lastly, the time is now to increase prices because I believe Netflix is sitting in a prime position where their price elasticity of demand is close to zero. This means that given everything else occurring in the streaming services sector, demand for a Netflix membership would not change significantly, if at all, if prices were to increase again by a reasonable amount (anything from $0.25 to $1.00 per month). Right now upper management has a slightly different view on raising prices. During the fourth quarter conference call, CFO David Wells stated that pricing tiers was the alternative to use for the near-term instead of increasing monthly fees flat out a $1 each year. CEO Reed Hastings suggested the ability to increase top tier prices for Ultra HD customers in the future. Supporting this scenario is the trends in customers purchasing Ultra HD TV sets. Overall, management's stance is to generate higher revenues under some method of increased pricing. Higher revenues allows Netflix to expand. This expansion allows it to develop and license more content while also improving services overall. The company plans to spend at least $3 billion in 2015 on content alone and over $500 million on technology upgrades across all the platforms it supports. On the customer side, the most popular choice happens to be the second tier which is $8.99 per month and gives customers access to HD quality programming and the ability to use Netflix on two separate platforms simultaneously. This second tier happens to be the same tier that got the $1 boost last May. Source: Google Finance - Netflix 5 year stock performance If anything can be said about Netflix's stock, it is that there is no smooth ride. One of the company's listed risk factors in their SEC filings admits that the company's stock is volatile. If volatility is what you are interested in, then Netflix's first quarter fiscal 2015 earnings scheduled for April 15, 2015 is sure to not disappoint. However, looking at the long-term scenario for Netflix, they are in the position other streaming services envy. In contrast to what the bears believe, increased content costs and so-called competition have been a blessing for Netflix. Netflix now has the ability to create more original content than their rivals as their traditional licensing business model slowly evolves to their benefit. The so-called competition has actually made Netflix prices more attractive as newcomers have entered the space with higher membership costs, while others don't possess the same library in terms of content quality. An increase of up to $1 per month for Netflix's most popular package, going from $8.99 to $9.99, would send shockwaves to the company's bottom line, and even then, Netflix would still arguably be the best bargain in the streaming services space. A less intuitive outcome could also occur if Netflix increases membership prices. Many current subscribers are still waiting for their 2014 $7.99 to $8.99 increase to kick in sometime in 2016. A price increase now for Netflix may help accelerate subscribers to get grandfathered in under current prices. Source: How Much More Can Netflix Really Charge Customers?
