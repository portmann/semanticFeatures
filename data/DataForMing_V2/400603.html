Disney: A Look At Cord Cutting In The First Quarter - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Persistent concerns over shifting video consumption patterns have weighed on Disney despite stellar growth. Early results from 2016 seem to show the stabilization of subscriber losses seen in Q4 of 2015 has continued through early 2016. The video landscape continues to adapt, and coming offerings from Hulu and Google for web-based TV will benefit Disney's Media Networks business. I have written many articles consistently arguing that The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS ) represents one of the best long-term investments in the S&P 500 due to its diverse and wildly popular stable of characters and proven franchise strategy of leveraging those characters across its business segments. Despite blockbuster earnings growth in the last quarter of 2015, concerns over the company's ability to grow its all important Media Networks segment have weighed on the stock since last summer. I continue to believe concerns over the impact of the shifting video consumption landscape are overblown, and emerging trends in the first quarter of 2016 that build on the last quarter of 2015 seem to bolster this argument. At the end of 2015, the rate of subscriber losses at the country's largest TV providers slowed, and in some cases, began to reverse. Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ), the country's largest provider, grew subscriptions by over 50,000 at the end of fourth quarter, joining Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) and DISH Network (NASDAQ: DISH ) in adding subscribers at the end of the year. Reported results for the first quarter of 2016 seem to show this trend from the end of 2015 is continuing. Comcast's strong subscription additions from Q4 continued in Q1 of 2016, with the company adding another 53,000 video customers in the first quarter versus a loss of 8,000 in Q1 of last year. This tally makes the first quarter of 2016 the strongest for net cable additions in nine years! This impressive result means that Comcast is now net positive for traditional video customers over the past 12 months. The sustainability of this growth is also evident in Comcast's ability to grow its cable revenue per customer by 4% in the first quarter of 2016, likely indicating strong demand for the company's new X1 product offering. Verizon FiOS also experienced continued subscriber growth from the fourth quarter of 2015 through the first quarter of 2016, reporting net additions of some 36,000 subscribers in the first three months of 2016. Verizon did not report as strong a revenue growth from its FiOS operation as Comcast reported from its video service, but the company did manage to eke out a fractional revenue gain as it relied on lower pricing to drive subscriber growth and market penetration. AT&T (NYSE: T ) and Time Warner Cable (NYSE: TWC ) each reported modest subscriber losses that were smaller than or in line with the modest trends established in the previous quarter. With AT&T, however, these numbers are likely to have been negatively impacted by the company actively integrating its DirecTV acquisition and switching customers from its AT&T U-verse product to DirecTV. Even with the inevitable turmoil of integration, the company's subscriber losses were approximately two-tenths of a percent of its total customer base of 25.3 million video subscribers. In both cases, however, the TV providers were able to grow revenue in the video businesses, demonstrating demand from its customers for the traditional TV product. DISH Network has not yet reported its first-quarter results, but it is reasonable to expect to see continued strength from the company's Sling TV product and a modest build or stabilization of net subscribers in the first quarter of 2016. It has become clear that there is still very strong demand for high-quality video content from American consumers. In fact, video consumption has never been higher at any point in measured modern programming. Disney CEO Bob Iger noted on the company's third-quarter conference call in August of 2015 that the average American is now consuming approximately six hours of video content per day. What is evolving is the means through which the consumer is accessing content. The past two quarters of operational results for Comcast, DirecTV, Time Warner, Verizon FiOS, and (very likely) DISH Network demonstrate that consumers still value traditional video products if they are enhanced with choice and flexibility. For example, Comcast noted that nearly 35% of all its video customers have now upgraded to the company's more expensive X1 platform that provides an integrated social, streaming, DVR, and voice search platform. Verizon too has noted that customers are choosing the so-called "skinny bundles," but looking to move up the value chain to larger packages of channels intermediate between a traditional and skinny bundle. The opportunities in the market are still enormous, a point that has been driven home this week with reports that both Hulu and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) will likely to begin offering streaming live TV service in 2017. DIS's investors should recognize that the video delivery landscape is evolving, but they should be confident that Disney's Media Networks segment is well positioned to capitalize on the change. While the traditional pay TV industry has experienced modest subscriber losses over the past 18 months, it is very likely that these losses have largely moderated or even subsided as the traditional pay TV bundle still offers a large percentage of American families a reasonable value relative to their interests in video consumption. In addition, coming innovations and competition from Internet-based and skinny bundles from a variety of providers including Hulu and Google in 2017 will provide further avenues for growth in the company's Media Networks business.
