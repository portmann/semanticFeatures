Low Share Prices Makes Apple A Screaming Buy - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple stock is trading in a range it hasn't seen since January. Stock is down on poor sales of iPhone 6 and Apple Watch. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is a screaming buy and this is a perfect time to build a core position in the world's leading technology company. Apple shares have traded a little above $130 four times this year. Each time it reaches that point it hits some resistance and falls. Currently, Apple shares are trading around $115, a price it hasn't seen since January. On Tuesday, shares slid 66 cents to close at $116.50. The latest plunge started July 21. That day the company from Cupertino, Calif., released results for the third quarter ended June 27. Revenue jumped 33% year over year to $49.6 billion. Net income climbed to $10.7 billion, or $1.85 per diluted share, a 45% increase over the $7.7 billion, or $1.28 per diluted share, in the third quarter last year. Gross margin was 39.7%, compared with 39.4% in the year-ago quarter. And it beat the analysts' consensus estimates of $1.81 a share on $49.43 billion in revenue. Because even though the earnings beat the forecasts, Wall Street wanted more. This result was the smallest topping of EPS in two years on a percentage basis. This came about because the company reported iPhone sales of 47.5 million units, failing to beat the 48.8 million analysts expected. Bank of America made a bold stance by downgrading the stock. It noted that the stock's price might be falling due to the company's inability to keep up growth in products, especially the iPhone. In addition, I think Wall Street was disappointed with sales of the new Apple Watch. A key component, called the taptic engine, turned out to be defective in a large number of watches, so availability of the new product was limited. But there wasn't a recall, because Apple never shipped the defective watches to distributors. I think this is a momentary blip and the price will soon move beyond $130, its highest range of the year, and climb to $146 within a year. First, I think the shares have hit this eight-month low because of external factors such as the Greek debt crisis, the Chinese stock market crash and a general malaise in the U.S. stock market. We are in the dog days of summer when stock trading slows down dramatically. All the executive-level traders go on vacation, leaving behind junior people. Although, the junior staffers have the right to buy stock, they can't buy and sell blocks of the size you normally see being traded. This means volume will be weak. But after Labor Day, when all the big traders are back at their desks ready to make money, I think the market's volume will pick up. In addition, we're moving into the Christmas quarter. I think the iPhone 6 is going to see a surge in sales and that the Apple Watch will be the company's next killer app. I think the Apple Watch will be the hot new toy on everybody's Christmas list this year. And remember, the Apple Watch was not recalled. It's not like they sold the watches then saw them coming back to be returned. Apple caught the problem itself before it ever reached the consumers. This is a testament to the lessons learned from the Apple Maps snafu, in which the product was released with a huge number of glitches. After the Maps fiasco, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said, "It should have not happened like it did. It shouldn't have come out. And you know, sometimes when you're running fast, you slip and fall. And I think the best thing you can do is get back up and say, 'I'm sorry.' And you try to remedy the situation and you work like hell to make the product right." blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/09/12/apples-c... / That's excellent quality control and companies with good quality control bounce back. In addition, about 73% of the outstanding shares are held by institutions. The current discount in the stock price is allowing investors to create a core trading position at the cheapest price we've seen in eight months. Start buying around $115 and it if goes lower, buy even more and trade around it. I think the stock will go as high as $146. Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL.
