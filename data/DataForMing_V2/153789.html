Apple iOS Ad Blocking: Google's Apocalypse Now - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Ad blocking in iOS 9 is a fundamentally new technology that will allow users to block ads efficiently from within the Safari browser for the first time. Making ad blocking available from within Safari will greatly increase the popularity of ad blocking among iOS users. The growing popularity of ad blocking in iOS will cascade to other platforms such as Android and Windows 10. Following my recent article on the new Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iOS ad blocking technology, fellow contributor Alcaraz Research raised some interesting points about the technology. Alcaraz concluded that Apple is unlikely to exploit the technology. He bases this on what he claims are performance issues for mobile devices as well as a potential loss of revenue from Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ). After considering his objections, I've come to exactly the opposite conclusion. Alcaraz's concerns about potential performance and battery drain for iOS devices cannot be dismissed out of hand. The technology that Apple is introducing with iOS 9 is so new that it's not clear how well it will work or what the performance penalty will be in using it. However, leaping to the conclusion that there will be a serious performance penalty is not supported by the facts. Alcaraz concludes that: What iOS 9 is promising to deliver is a "Content Blocking" extension API (Application Programming Interface) that uses JavaScript and CSS to block content before a page is loaded on Safari. This is simply incorrect, and indicates that Alcaraz doesn't understand Apple's description of the new content blocking API. What Alcaraz describes above is the current approach used in Safari running on Mac OS X, not Safari in iOS. Here, I need to provide just a little technical background that I hope will clarify things for the reader. Safari in Mac OS X provides developers with a way to write extensions (basically plugins) for the Safari browser that enhance its functionality. JavaScript is a programming language commonly used to provide app-like functionality for web pages. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS are just text files used to specify web page layout details such as which font to use in a text block. This approach to creating browser extensions was pioneered not by Apple, but by Mozilla over a decade ago. Currently, it is impossible for a developer to write an extension of this type for the iOS version of Safari, nor will it be possible to do so for the future version of Safari in iOS 9. Alcaraz is correct in asserting that such extensions would have performance drawbacks, which is exactly why they are not allowed in iOS. This point was made clear by one of the references Alcaraz cites to support his case, a blog post on the WebKit site. WebKit was developed by Apple and serves as the basis for many browsers, including Safari and Google's Chrome (in part). The post was made shortly after WWDC rolled out the new iOS content blocking technology and is intended to explain why it's superior to the old-fashioned approach of JavaScript and CSS. The blog post doesn't really clarify the difference between the old type of extensions in Mac OS X Safari and the new type in iOS. This may be the reason why Alcaraz misinterpreted the post. It's possible to write "extensions" for Safari in iOS 8, but not the Mac OS X type. App extensions in iOS 8 are mainly for linking one app with another in a convenient way. For instance, social apps like Twitter and Facebook provide Safari app extensions that allow the user to bring web page content into the social app. These extensions are available from the "Share" drop down menu in the app. The extension framework consists of APIs made available to developers under iOS. Apple created the framework in order to provide a way for developers to do things like develop extensions for Safari (where it is often used) that would still be very energy efficient. The content blocking in iOS 9 is based on expanding the iOS 8 extension framework with a new type of extension. It's not based on the old JavaScript/CSS approach at all, and should be a lot more efficient. Apple is always very conscious of performance impacts within iOS, and generally takes a very conservative approach when deploying new APIs in iOS in order to ensure that battery life is acceptable. What isn't clear is how well the new content blocking extensions will actually work. Developers have to first build the extensions for iOS 9 using the new API. The technology may not work as well as the older approach in Mac OS X. This was noted by another one of the references that Alcaraz cites, a blog post by the developer of Adblock Plus, an ad blocker that is available for Mac OS X Safari as a conventional extension. However, it's better than no ad blocking extensions at all, which is what we have in iOS 8. Currently, to get ad blocking in iOS 8, users have to use a stand alone browser app. I've tried a couple of them, and they work reasonably well in blocking ads. Performance was a mixed bag, however, with some browsers loading much faster than others. If the reader is interested in trying one out, I suggest AdBlockWeb, which is available free. AdBlockWeb works very well and doesn't appear to impose much of a performance penalty compared to Safari. Alcaraz also speculates that Apple would be reluctant to jeopardize the income supposedly derived from fees paid by Google to be the default search engine in Safari. This fee amounts to $1 billion per year. Given that Apple's net income in fiscal 2014 was $39.5 billion, it's hard to see this as significant motivation. More importantly, the issues aren't really linked. Blocking display ads in web pages probably wouldn't impact Google search results, which push "sponsored links" to the top of the search results. Filtering this kind of advertising is probably not within the bounds of what the content blocking API can achieve. Google might voice objections to the content blocking API when its agreement with Apple comes up for renewal in a couple of years, but I doubt it. Google needs, first and foremost, to maintain its share of searches. This is its core business. Apple may elect not to go with Google anyway. Apple has been gradually enhancing its own search capability (called Spotlight) beyond just internal device searches to include Web derived information. Siri also provides limited Web search capability. As I pointed out in Apple's Search Opportunity , Apple doesn't need to monetize search with sponsored content and has a motivation to provide a search capability rivaling Google's, but without the advertising. Here, the motivation is simply to provide a better experience for iOS and Mac OS X users. Apple also has the resources to create a search capability. This may come about slowly, but it probably will come in time. Apple is continually looking for ways to "widen the moat" around its Mac OS X and iOS users. Reducing Google's advertising revenue from iOS devices appears to be a very logical way to do that. As I thought about my previous article on ad blocking ( Apple: Is iOS 9 Ad Blocking A Threat To Google? ), as well as the article of Alcaraz Research, I concluded that I had really mistitled the article by framing it as a rhetorical question. There's no longer any doubt in my mind that iOS ad blocking will have a direct impact on Google. Right now, it's not popular in iOS because it requires a stand alone browser, and most iOS users tend to prefer Safari. The addition of ad blocking to Safari means that many more iOS users will choose to employ ad blocking. Ad blocking in iOS has already been demonstrated to work well, and I can attest to the fact that it really improves the browsing experience. I expect it to become almost universal within a few years. This elevates ad blocking to greater than a mere threat for Google. It's a reality that Google and its investors will have to face. As ad blocking becomes popular in iOS, it will tend to be adopted in Android and other platforms as well. The effect is a cascading collapse of display advertising revenue, as ad blocking propagates to all computing platforms, and as advertisers abandon the display ad approach. As I have already pointed out, display advertising amounts to about 20% of Google's revenue. The impending loss of this revenue should cause Google investors to reevaluate their assumptions about Google's long-term prospects. Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL.
