A Look At Boeing's Commercial Orders And Deliveries In January 2016 - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha January orders were boosted by order for the Boeing 737-700. January deliveries are in line with expectations. In 2015 I started the monthly wrap ups of orders and deliveries of Boeing (NYSE: BA ) and Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSF ) aircraft. In 2016 I will continue this series of articles. Despite the month of January having passed quite a while ago, I will still dedicate an article to the January order inflow and deliveries in order to keep a complete overview for the entire year. Figure 1: Boeing orders (up until) January 2016 (Source: AeroAnalysis.net ) In January, Boeing booked 68 orders, with 61 orders for its single-aisle product and 7 orders for a wide-body aircraft. With 90% of the orders being for narrow body aircraft, the order inflow was rather unbalanced. In terms of value the narrow body orders accounted for 80% of the market value, while the wide body order inflow accounted for the remaining 20%. At list prices, the orders are valued at $9.0bn, but after discounts the orders have a market value of $4.8bn: Air China ordered 6 Boeing 777-300ERs, probably this order was part of the mega order placed by China in 2015 Order inflow was boosted by an order for 40 Boeing 737-700s from United Airlines (NYSE: UAL ), worth $3.2bn at list prices Remaining orders include 1 order for the Boeing 787-9 and 1 order for the Boeing 737 BBJ MAX. Year-over-year Boeing booked significantly more orders. In the same month last year Boeing booked just 5 orders versus the 68 orders in January 2016. Figure 2: Boeing deliveries (up until) January 2016 (Source: AeroAnalysis) Important to note is that Boeing's guidance implies a lower delivery target compared to 2015. The jet maker expects to deliver between 740 and 745 airframes in 2016, compared to 750-755 targeted deliveries in 2015. Despite expected deliveries standing at 62 (average per month), deliveries were in line with expectations. Boeing delivered 49 airframes in January, compared to 50 deliveries in January 2015. 70% or 35 out of all deliveries was a 737 1 Boeing 747-8I was delivered to Korean Air Various operators took delivery of 6 Boeing 777-300ERs 7 Dreamliners were delivered, 6 of which are Boeing 787-9s. It can be concluded that the Boeing 787-9 will have the overhand in the Dreamliner deliveries, which bodes well for Boeing as the aircraft has higher profit margins. Just like in 2015, Boeing is targeting a 1:1 book-to-bill ratio. In January Boeing booked 68 orders and delivered 49 airframes, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.39. If the number of average needed deliveries (to meet the delivery target) is being used, the book to bill ratio is also in excess of 1. This shows that Boeing had a moth in which it realized its book to bill ratio. However, with only 1 month having passed nothing can be said about Boeing's full year performance. Order inflow was boosted by an order for the Boeing 737-700 and the Boeing 737-800, which accounted for 60 out of the 68 orders Deliveries were in line with expectations So far Boeing managed to realize a book-to-bill ratio in excess of 1, but with 11 months remaining a lot can happen In 2015 Boeing achieved its book-to-bill target at the very last moment. Despite lower anticipated deliveries in 2016, I expect Boeing to be facing a major challenge to achieve its book-to-bill target. In April 2015 I published an article in which I said that the order books of jet makers are not bubbles, but should decline at some point. In that article I shared my thoughts and expected order inflow to decline in a few years from now. With oil prices having declined ever since, chances are the order books will decline sooner than I expected at first. With Boeing just barely meeting its target last year, 2016 might be the year in which Boeing will not achieve its book-to-bill ratio. This, however, is not necessarily a bad thing although a lot of investors and analysts might think so. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
