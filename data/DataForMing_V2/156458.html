Following the biggest 4-day decline in AAPL stock since Jan 2014, the "no brainer" once-darling of the investing world has just officially entered a bear market, down 20% from its April record highs.

And having the US stock market drop 9% from its high will not help Apple either. The Dow has lost a 1000 points this week.

You think Crapple devices are any more NSA friendly than any other OS.

My last few machines have been PC's including one that is running Proxmox (free) with 48 Xeon cores, 112GB RAM and 120TB of disk space.  I built it myself and it cost about the same as my last Mac desktop.  If/when the iPhone stops being cool, they are going to have to reinvent themselves or their goose is cooked. Have pirated copy of Windows 7 Ultimate which is bullet proof and Windows 8 and Windows 10 sucks. Anyone with half a brain can build a PC for half of what you pay in a store, where its loaded with bloatware.

Especially during a time when Apple's Chinese competitors were rising fast. Apple may claim they sell million upon millions of iPhones in China, but most are just channel stuffed sitting on shelves never to be sold. They are sold according to Apple, and the revenue has been booked. When the time comes Apple will just charge off the inventory and use it to offset taxes through their Double Dutch Irish Sandwich bullshit. OnePlus, Xiaomi, Lenovo, ASUS, and others are eating Apple's lunch and decimating margins. The US financial press claims they Chinese companies aren't making any money but that is a blatant lie. The iPhone has a production cost around $100. Xiaomi is selling a phone for $300 and making at least $200 on each one. The smartphone has become commoditized. A full price unlocked Moto E costs $149. They aren't selling these things for a loss. The $600 smartphone is becoming a luxury item. $299 will become the max anyone will pay for an unlocked phone, cutting Apple's margin by 50-60%. The list of superior devices to the iPhone for half the cost grows larger every day. Even Sony is selling an unlocked phone that destroys the iPhone spec wise for $400.
