The Force Is Strong With Disney's Star Wars 7 Debut Deal For IMAX Theaters - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Walt Disney has reserved the majority of IMAX theatres worldwide to show "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" for a full month following the December 18 release. Disney is attempting to help the film become potentially the biggest box office hit since Avatar. The September 4 "Force Friday" toy sale will generate more demand in Star Wars merchandise leading up to Christmas sales. Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS ) is setting the stage for the release of Star Wars 7 to generate maximum exposure and potentially a record-breaking first weekend box office gross. Disney has made a deal to reserve most of IMAX screens worldwide, including all of IMAX's North American large-format screens to show Star Wars: The Force Awakens for one month from the film's December 18 release. Other films screening around that time will have to make way for one of the most anticipated films in years because Disney wants this film on as many screens as possible to surpass the record $208 million domestic first weekend gross set this year by Jurassic World, produced by Comcast Corporation's (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) NBC Universal. Star Wars fans will love watching the film on the large IMAX screens, and I would expect the media to do their part in reporting the event, creating more buzz and attention for the film. Some box office projections are coming in around $2-$2.2 billion in total worldwide, which would put it well ahead of Jurassic World's $1.62 billion and Furious 7's $1.51 billion. Disney's sell-off from media networks slowdown Expected revenues for Disney are more than $1 billion from the new Star Wars episode. A very big box office result will also take some of the pressure off of the company and its stock as well. Disney announced in its latest earnings call that its media networks segment, which handles the TV production and special broadcasting programs like ESPN, ABC and ABC Family, had experienced a slowdown in operating earnings growth. Media networks is Disney's largest revenue generator, and in Q3 2015 it earned $2.3 billion in operating income, more than double the next largest Parks and Resorts segment. After the earnings release, Disney led other entertainment stocks down, itself selling off about 13% to $105 a share over several days. Overseas film markets will be very important to the final success of Star Wars 7 since international box office could be as much as double the domestic market will generate. The big target to take out is the $2.7 billion earned by Avatar released in 2009. Disney's rival, NBC Universal, is having their own record-breaking year among 2015 film releases, already grossing $5.53 billion already this year, thanks to the two big hits mentioned above plus others like Minions and 50 Shades of Grey. That now puts it ahead of Twenty-First Century Fox's (NASDAQ: FOXA ) $5.52 record set in 2014. Morgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne projected Star Wars related licensed goods could have sales up to $3 billion, resulting in Disney receiving around $215 million in sales. To get fans and toy lovers whipped up for the film release, Disney plans to post a series of YouTube videos of the new line of Star Wars toys being unwrapped over an 18-hour period set in 15 different locations across the globe. That will be the lead-up to the Force Friday toy sale happening on September 4 when the toys featured in the videos will be available for purchase. Disney knows how to put on a show, and consumer goods can get off to a good start even before Christmas. Disney stock recovered slightly from the quick China-related market sell-off earlier in the week where it touched $95. The market is still trying to figure out how to handle the slower cable TV earnings and a little pullback in the number of ESPN subscribers. Investors were previously mesmerized by the potential revenues Star Wars is offering, sending the stock to over $121. I earlier felt the stock might be getting ahead of itself due to the slowdown in media networks. Yet now that has been better factored into the share price. Oppositely, the real results of Star Wars 7 could surprise to the upside of present estimates. I think that could ignite the share price later on. Currently at $102.48, Disney is trading at 18 times forward earnings. Around $100 is a good level to build up positions. Disney's stock story is improving overall, so it's better to stick with the stock and take advantage of the quick pullback.
