A Deep Dive Into iPhone 8 And Curved Glass - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Patent applications can be ambiguous and sometimes fail to achieve a granted USPTO patent. Using curved glass is complicated and expensive. It forces upon higher prices and lesser profit margins. It is sensible for investors to consider all the variables for investing in a company aiming to utilize curved glass for a product. With Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPhone 7 expecting to find less enthusiasm from the media pundits and sell-side analysts when it launches this fall, the expectations for the iPhone 8 are increasingly being speculated upon. And these speculations have broadly surfaced via the study of former patent filings by Apple Inc. Some of these patents originate some nine years ago with publication dating back to 2008. The photograph below has been presented by Patnetly Apple. As it pertains to patent applications, anybody and any conceptual rendering can be applied for patent protection. It just takes a little bit of money. Ideally, the greatest of patent protections come from those filed with utility rather than design as design patents are extremely difficult to defend upon infringement. If an inventor is seeking the greatest of international protection with regard to the invention they are likely to file for a PCT patent that would grant protection in all 148 PCT participating countries. This is of course assuming that all claims within the patent are granted and registered. Just because you've filed for a patent doesn't mean it will be granted either, especially if it infringes on another patent's claims. A really good example of this is what just happened to Juicero. You've probably heard of the company as it raised $120mm in capital from investors that included Kleiner Perkins, which housed the early-stage startup, and Campbell Soup (NYSE: CPB ). Google Ventures, Double Bottom Line Ventures, Artis Ventures, Thrive Capital and Vast Ventures also invested in the company. Unfortunately what hasn't been reported is the 40-page patent rejection letter that Juicero received two weeks ago from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Some big-name investors on that list that are going to be quite perturbed if Juicero can't find a way to protect its technology and business model. But now that we understand the nuances surrounding patent applications a little more, let's discuss the iPhone 8 in terms of cents and sensibility. No, not Sense and Sensibility as the 1811 Jane Austin novel was so ingeniously titled, but cents and sensibility as that is what we have to consider when it comes to Apple and its future product cycle. A select segment of the iPhone 8 product cycle is reportedly and speculated to adopt the utility and form of curved glass. While the nightmare that is curved glass is well understood by the manufacturing and engineering community, it's not always or frequently understood by the layperson. As such when the layperson incorporates the potential use of curved glass for an iPhone 8 product launch, they would likely benefit from a greater understanding of the impact from such material and form factor on the company employing the material and form factor. In short, it's quite simplistic to state "The iPhone 8 will utilize an all-glass structure and regain its high-end market momentum." But the hard part is analyzing and respecting all the variables surrounding what it takes to employ an all-glass/curved glass device that would exhibit such an outcome as stated. Often times, that is where I'm called upon to evaluate the potential of a future product launch by investors. In a recent Seeking Alpha publication by Paulo Santos titled " Apple: iPhone 8 Will Be The iPhone Steve Jobs Wanted " we are forced to recognize the author makes several claims. Within those claims however is not a single notation or representation of cents, dollars and cents to be precise. At best we can assume the ambiguity of suggesting a recapturing of high-end market momentum defines costs of an all-glass iPhone 8. If Apple is able to pull off the technical marvel described above, Apple will (for a while, at least) completely regain the high-end of the market. There's no debating that Apple and/or Steve Jobs had an all-glass vision for an iPhone product. But when the genesis of the idea took place and why it has yet to surface resides in the complex understanding of cost to build such a device. And to be clear, the genesis of a curved glass iPhone existed prior to the launch of the original iPhone. However, it is within the material and manufacturing outlay that defines the greatest of construct issues regarding a curved glass smartphone by Apple or its peers. All technologies and manufacturing processes to develop an all-glass embodiment of the iPhone and its applications have existed for years and decades, notwithstanding the digital strength. You can see the accomplishments of this technology around the world in high-rise buildings, condominiums and other architectures. There was only a singular aspect that could or would have prevented Apple from developing and launching this all-glass concept some years ago and it all comes down to dollars and cents. If we are asked to accept the notion that Apple is a leader of technological aesthetic implementation or form factor as its proponents would have one believe, then certainly an all-glass smartphone would validate the claim or at least reinforce the claim. But Apple hasn't continued down this road for the stated reason of costs. The curving of glass is a careful consideration of a cumbersome and costly process. How's that for a perfectly positioned alliteration of profound precision? But I digress. Don't let the patent filings, even the granting of such patents fool you into accepting the efficacy of such an end product in the marketplace. As an investor, the first consideration for such a product should always aim in the direction of profit margins and what those profits mean to the company's bottom line. This is the sensibility we hope our corporate executives have and maintain through product cycles. With Apple abandoning the idea of using curved glass due to cost years ago, it would seem as though management was very sensible. So it's curved glass, that is what we are talking about in an all-glass iPhone 8. And I believe it will come to be. I don't care about could be as I care more broadly about the costs and profitability of such a product. So let's analyze when the all-glass iPhone 8 comes to be what are the possible ramifications. In doing so, what I think we will come to better understand is that the mother of invention is not always a consideration of could it be done, but rather should it be done. In producing an iPhone with a curved glass form for a segment of the iPhone 8 product cycle, Apple will obviously not be the first to market with such a concept. Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) launched the Galaxy 6 and 7 Edge smartphone devices in such a form factor previously. In doing so Samsung learned a good deal about curved glass implementation for a mass scale device. I wouldn't go so far as suggesting Samsung learned a lesson as the company cares little for learning lessons given its supreme market presence and revenue might. Samsung is of greater size and presence than Apple and the smartphone represents only one of the Korean giant's product segments. As such, if Samsung wants to cause disruptions in the smartphone industry using curved glass or any other material and form factor, even at its own expense, they can do so without the same considerations that Apple might contend with. Samsung's launch of the Galaxy 6 Edge (curved glass smartphone) was met with strong demand last year and the curved edged device was revisited with the launch of the Galaxy 7 Edge in 2016. Having said that, both the 6 and 7 Edge smartphones carry with them a higher cost when compared to the Galaxy 6 and 7 devices that have a flat screen. The cost has nothing to do with the size of the screen, but rather the manufacturing and material costs associated with curved glass versus the typical flat glass screen. Flat glass sheets can cost as little as $2 and as much as $4 per sheet. But curved glass can cost as little as $22 and as much as $26 a sheet . Samsung wanted something different and innovative when it came to its Galaxy 6 device last year and in doing so they understood there was a cost associated with such desires. The costs associated with a less profitable curved glass smartphone were hoped to be offset with market share gains and/or sales volume, but that didn't come to pass as sales for the Galaxy 6 product line fell year-over-year . Analysts initially predicted that Galaxy S6 sales would drag Samsung's growth back into the black, but the latest projections show Samsung's profit dropping 24% year-over-year from Q2 2014. In fairness to Samsung and its curved glass Galaxy 6 Edge sales, the primary issue with sales was forecasting demand and enthusiasm for the device. Essentially, there was more demand than forecasted by Samsung. Even more unfortunate was the fact that it didn't really matter that the forecast was off, as the company could not ever really perfect the supply line timelines for a curved glass device. Samsung won't tell the media or investors that, but manufacturers understand this to be the "anomalistic" factor of dealing with such material and form factor. Why is this? The failure rate with thermoforming sheets of glass to exhibit a curve can average 50 percent. In other words, 50% of these sheets of glass have to be discarded… and I'm likely being generous in this regard. As such, forecasting is rendered useless if you are Samsung and you don't know if your manufacturing of material will fall below the 50% average or above it. Secondly, there is the time involved in the thermoforming process, which is the heating and molding of the glass. The process doesn't end there, as the glass will have to be chemically treated and finally polished. The entire process for manufacturing one curved sheet of glass can extend up to an hour…for just one sheet. How do you even establish adequate supply lines with that timeline and the understood failure rate? Simply put, you don't! Accept what it is and what such a product line can deliver with regard to profitability. But again, Samsung cares and doesn't care at the same time. While the smartphone business remains a highly relevant and profitable business for Samsung, where they believe they can supplant Apple and the iPhone they will try, even if it comes with lesser profits as it undoubtedly has. "Sticking it" to the iPhone has never been an action avoided by Samsung, regardless of the outcome. Samsung's exampled issues with curved glass only serve to highlight what Apple understood to be an impediment to such a smartphone material design implementation years ago and even prior to the launch of the first iPhone. Don't let analysts fool you into believing the published 2011 all-glass Apple patent is the only one that mentions using shaped glass. In Apple's litigation against Samsung such varied curved glass patents came into examination. Apple's Douglas Satzger testified the reasoning for not continuing with the curved glass device was a factor of manufacturing technology and costs for curving glass being too exorbitant. Below is an extrapolation of Satzger's deposition from the Apple/Samsung trial years ago as reported by Yoni Heisler: Satzger worked at Apple from 1996 through 2008 as an "Industrial Design Creative Lead" and helped work on the original iPhone, the iPhone 3G, and the iPhone 3GS. He is currently the VP of Industrial Design at Intel. In any event, I found a few tidbits of information from Satzger's deposition that are worth sharing. First, Satzger at one point is questioned by Samsung's attorney about the design of the original iPhone and acknowledges that there was a strong interest from within Apple's industrial design team to develop a phone with shaped glass. The technology in shaping the glass, the cost relative to shaping the glass at the time, and some of the design features of this specific shape were not liked. Given what we know now, it's not a matter of whether Apple could produce an all-glass/curved glass iPhone, it's a question of should Apple do so. Should Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) have developed Google Glass just because it could do so, or invest in Juicero? Should Keurig have developed Keurig Kold just because it could do so? Should Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) have spent so much to acquire Tumbler, which I don't even think has been mentioned since the acquisition? The list of negligent products that have been developed and brought to the marketplace over the years is quite extensive to say the least. Getting back to the testimony above, even when we consider the durability of gorilla glass today, the cost to manufacture curved glass still renders an end product challenged for greater profit margins. Investors would be advantaged to ask themselves the following questions given the rendered information within: As a publicly traded company that's already seeing both sales and profits decline, based on what we now know about curved glass, should Apple go down this road? Even if for just a small product segment at the high-end of the market? And what would there be to gain from doing so? Branding, doesn't Apple already have a strong brand? In a saturated smartphone market, is the smaller, high-end market where volumes will find acceleration? Don't smaller volumes for a high-end marketplace impact a product's profitability due to economies of scale? Would an all-glass iPhone 8 be just another follow-the-leader, imitator product shortcoming like the most recent Apple Watch that proved to be too expensive and with little utility upgrades to differentiate itself from other Apple smartphones? Could an all-glass iPhone actually prove to go too far out on a limb that it fails in such a way that it diminishes the brand? Is all-glass too much glass? Samsung Edge devices require a Samsung direct warranty for $129, not sold by carriers who won't cover the damage to the glass because it can't be repaired by their affiliates. In truth there are a great deal more questions that one could ask themselves regarding the iPhone 8 glass product. The most important question or aspect of the product is profitability that will likely be found wanting. If you are an investor this is the greatest consideration, even as it hadn't been previously explored in other, more recent articles. Such critical thinking is what can help investors better understand the potential of a company's future. Innovation is a constant and patents follow innovation. But this doesn't always mean a product should be developed and launched along the lines of the claims in the patent. Sometimes the patents prove to elicit the characteristics of vaporware, never actually coming to the marketplace or coming to the marketplace in a very different alignment from the original patent. When I first read through some of the articles that discussed the iPhone 8 glass smartphone I thought this was an interesting concept, but where's the cost benefit analysis? Anybody, anybody? In my opinion, that should be the key takeaway for investors and it should trump the WOW variable that may not even be so WOW come 2017. Where would an iPhone 8 glass phone, expected to launch in 2017, place Apple at that time given what we've seen in several product developments from the competition? We already know that flexible displays are being widely developed by LG and Samsung and set to launch in the coming years, possibly as early as 2017 given Samsung's articulations. Lenovo has recently been showcasing a truly flexible smartphone and tablet at its ongoing Tech World event . The following image was presented by NewsDog: At the event, Lenovo called upon YouTube sensation Meghan McCarthy to showcase its future bendable smartphone and tablet. McCarthy showcased a smartphone that doesn't need to be kept in a bag or pockets, and can be simply worn on one's wrist like a bracelet. If that wasn't enough, she also showed a tablet that can be folded down the middle and used like a large screened smartphone. Of course, Lenovo patented the technology that allows for the folding and bending of materials years ago only to bring this smartphone and tablet product concept to market now. Well, it's not really for sale, but a chosen few got to check it out at the Tech World event. How much will such a malleable smartphone and tablet cost is the key question and more than likely a question that will remain unanswered because nobody is in the business of dampening the mood surrounding "possibility." But the possibilities and patents just keep on coming for smartphone and tech gadgets. The latest rendering comes from Samsung, offering a 3-in-1 smart device platform of their own with flexible OLED technologies. The following renderings come from galaxyclub.nl. The patent application was filed in 2014 at the Korean Intellectual Property Office, and the most interesting thing about this new device is the flexible OLED display. It's the one feature that would make it possible for the handset to fold into a smartwatch, stretch into a phone or fold out and become a tablet. It seems a rather futuristic idea, one that won't see the light of day anytime soon. Still, the images that came together with the patent application are enough to get us interested, even if they showcase a concept, rather than an actual product. Meanwhile, Samsung's rumored foldable display phone is slated to make a debut in 2017. The device has been reported by some tipsters to be named Galaxy X and may be launched sometime in the first half of 2017. While the WOW factor looms, again, investors would be sensible to consider the cost of such a technology. Kind of interesting how the Korean Intellectual Property Office works, isn't it? Took them less than two years to review the patent, issue rejections, have the patents amended, granted and register in that time. You might have that accomplished in about 3-5 years here in the United States. But then again it is Korea and it is Samsung greasing the wheels so… As these products come to the surface in the likeness that the iPhone 8 is being more broadly discussed for its potential, where does the advantage really come to be found by an iPhone 8 glass smartphone? I don't know about you, but a smartphone that could be manipulated into three different forms and screen sizes - that seems more advantageous than glass with regard to utility alone. Having said that, we have to harken back to what it all boils down to, cost! How much does a 3-in-1 smart device platform cost the vendor and the consumer? This will likely determine the success or failure for such a product. As an investor myself, when seeing all these different and supposed advancements in technology come to form, I know I can only advantage myself by gathering as much information as possible. I don't know for certain if Steve Jobs' vision for the original iPhone or the iPhone 8 was to be developed with an all glass form and I may never know. But what I do know is that investors should always dig a little deeper than headline grabbers.
