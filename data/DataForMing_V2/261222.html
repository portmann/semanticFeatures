Mark Zuckerberg Storms Into The Trump 'Muslim Ban' Scandal, Tells Muslims "You Are Always Welcome Here" | Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! We all need to work together to create an environment that is hostile to bad guys.  We don't need more gun-free zones like San Bernadino... Why does most brand-name beer taste like swill? Why has the standard of living across most of the Western world fallen by more than half over the past 40+ years?  People understand nothing lasts forever. The bottom does not last forever. You want to buy low and sell high. Not only are we skipping along the lows, perhaps we can go lower but there is true value...

Moments ago, the latest high profile media figure to boldly go into the rapidly spreading Trump "ban Muslims" scandal, was none other than Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who in a post on his social network, took the other side of Trump declaring that "Muslims are always welcome here" and that Facebook will "fight to protect your rights and create a peaceful and safe environment for you." It was not immediately clear if the "community" he was welcoming Muslims to is the United States or the online world of Facebook ad clickers.  His full Facebook post (which has so far been "liked" over 215K times) is below: After the Paris attacks and hate this week, I can only imagine the fear Muslims feel that they will be persecuted for the actions of others. As a Jew, my parents taught me that we must stand up against attacks on all communities. Even if an attack isn't against you today, in time attacks on freedom for anyone will hurt everyone. If you're a Muslim in this community, as the leader of Facebook I want you to know that you are always welcome here and that we will fight to protect your rights and create a peaceful and safe environment for you. Having a child has given us so much hope, but the hate of some can make it easy to succumb to cynicism. We must not lose hope. As long as we stand together and see the good in each other, we can build a better world for all people. To some online commentators, the statement rings of hollow cynicism, since the gentrified Palo Alto enclave for uber wealthy tech millionaires where Zuckerberg lives is hardly the diverse melting pot of social, ethical and religious strife and tensions, which have come to characterize many of the world's geographic areas where cohabitation between Muslims and other religions has in recent months unleashed an unprecedented backlash - especially in Europe - against Muslims. To others, Zucherberg's statement comes as a surprise that the social media mogul, who has until now resisted involvement in any openly political debates, has decided to so loudly wage right into this one. The reason is that according to a just released poll , nearly two-thirds of likely GOP primary voters support Trumpâ€™s proposal to ban Muslims from coming into the country. The latest Bloomberg Politics/Purple Strategies PulsePoll released Wednesday reveals that the real estate mogulâ€™s latest remarks are backed by 65 percent of likely GOP voters. When told both sides of the argument, support for Trumpâ€™s proposal remained relatively unchanged at 64 percent. The online poll conducted Wednesday also found that about 37 percent of those surveyed would be more likely to vote for the businessman after his call to temporarily halt Muslims from entering the United States until elected leaders can â€œfigure out whatâ€™s going on.â€? The risk that Zuckerberg is taking is that by openly endorsing the other side of the argument, while making an ethical stand he is also jeopardizing a business model which relies on the goodwill of its users, many of whom may be openly antagonized by Zuckerberg's moral stance. And since that 65% of GOP potential GOP voters, whose ideological position is now diametrically opposed to that of the Facebook CEO, is in the tens of millions of Americans, one wonder just how many of the 167 million in North American Daily Active Users... ... Zuckerberg is willing to sacrifice in order to make his stand? Meanwhile, even as support for Trump's proposal appears to be widespread within the republican constituency, others don't share that view as can be seen by what Atlanta police have dubbed to be "Trump Swastika" which have been reported in various locations in Atlanta. Finally, taking a campaign that has been unorthodox, to say the least, from the start, late yesterday one of the biggest losers from Trump's relentless popularity, Jeb Bush, went on twitter to speculate that Trump's campaign is nothing but a conspiracy with Hillary, one which will "put here in the White House" Maybe Donald negotiated a deal with his buddy @HillaryClinton . Continuing this path will put her in the White House. https://t.co/AlvByiSrMn Could Donald Trump be doing all this to wreck the Republican Party and clear the path for his old friend Hillary Clinton to take the White House. Here's the supporting evidence, such as it is: As recently as 2012 Trump said this of Mrs Clinton: "Hillary Clinton I think is a terrific woman. I am biased because I have known her for years. I live in New York. She lives in New York. I really like her and her husband both a lot. I think she really works hard." Trump previously donated money to Mrs Clinton in 2002, 2005, 2006 and 2007. Trump has donated more than $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation. Trump's daughter Ivanka is close friends with Chelsea Clinton. In 2005 Hillary Clinton attended Mr Trump's wedding to Melania Knauss, his current wife, in Florida. Trump was a registered Democrat between 2001 and 2009 before switching to the Republican Party. It all adds up for Jeb Bush, whose campaign has been killed by Trump's popularity. Bush said: "Maybe Donald negotiated a deal with his buddy Hillary Clinton. Continuing this path will put her in the White House." According to the Chief Investment Officer of CalSTRS , "a presidential matchup between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton could sap a full percentage point from anticipated growth in the gross domestic product, the chief investment officer of the second-largest U.S. pension fund said." â€œCan you imagine a whole year of Trump and Hillary going at each other?â€? Christopher Ailman, who manages the California State Teachersâ€™ Retirement Systemâ€™s $184 billion portfolio, said Tuesday on Bloomberg Television. â€œItâ€™s going to be a drag on the economy.â€? Ailman said 70 percent of the U.S. economy is based on consumer sales, and a divisive presidential campaign is likely to depress consumer confidence. He didnâ€™t comment on Clinton but said Trumpâ€™s statements â€œreverberateâ€? across the global economy. The Republican real-estate mogul, who leads in all national polls for his partyâ€™s nomination, this week called for a ban on Muslims entering the U.S. â€œIâ€™m worried about 2016,â€? said Ailman, who has a degree in business economics. â€œIf you took everybodyâ€™s GDP projections of 2 to 3 percent growth, Iâ€™m sad to say you could probably take a full percentage point off of that.â€? In a year in which a record El Nino is expected to make the GDP-crushing "harsh winter" a distant memory, perhaps a Trump vs Clinton campaign is precisely what the soon to be much weaker US economy needs as the Fed is in urgently need of an alibi when the "expected" growth resulting from the December 16 rate hike fails to materialize - and in fact leads to just the opposite outcome - and the Fed is forced to backtrack instead, launching either NIRP or more QE or both. Thanks to Trump and Hillary going "at each other", of course. What the answer is we don't know, although as US society appears ready to split along racial, social, cultural and religious lines, we have somehow never felt quite so entertained even as society is quietly tearing itself apart.

"The popular belief that a gigantic clash of civilizations explains todayâ€™s conditions fits well into the propaganda efforts of the neocon inspired American Empire."  - Ron Paul "Fear is the tool used to galvanize a people into supporting war while sacrificing liberty. Exaggerations and propping up groups who falsely claim to represent 99 percent of Muslims, serves the interests of those in the West who want the clash of civilizations for their own selfish purposes. Current US and Western support for ISIS in Syria, even though itâ€™s denied, is designed to remove Assad. This policy is in the tradition of our foreign policy of recent decades. Aligning ourselves with the creation of Hamas and the mujahedin (Taliban) is well documented."  - Ron Paul Wed, 12/09/2015 - 19:44 | 6902016 Fredo Corleone Yet another example supporting the fact that Trump owns the media; The Donald lives rent free inside their collective heads.

Today, there is a fight for America between two groups of NWO oligarchy:  - One segment of NWO oligarchy are trying to destroy the USA the same way they have destroyed  the USSR (this is the Zionist Banking Mafia who also owns the mass media) - The other segment of NWO oligarchy are trying to preserve  the USA as the only world superpower (this is mostly big businesses like the US military-industrial complex). This group does not want to see the USA destruction but is so far is quite passive. Potentially, Trump and Hiltery on the same side and represent the second group. This is why Trump must help to stop Bush and destroy the Republican party who became a Party of political prostitutes. "Palestinians aren't Muslims, are they ?"  Hell no Zuck, bulldozing homes on the West Bank is a sign of unending friendship. Wed, 12/09/2015 - 20:35 | 6902232 Titus Exactly. If the fucker wants to welcome Muslims, send them to his private Hawaiian compound. That fucker should be secured enough that the cannot escape.

For example Rabbi Mizrachi's facebook page, with 50,000, followers was banned by Zuckerberg when the Rabbi pointed out that Zuckerberg was a participant in the silent holocaust because he married that chinese woman.

Wed, 12/09/2015 - 19:31 | 6901955 sgt_doom Firstly, the prez of the USA says that "we" will continue to support the Sunni extremist rebels in Syria (al Qaeda) and today that shit-for-brains at the Pentagon, Ashole Carter, says special ops personnel will be sent to train more al Qaeda in Syria. Now why are we unwashed masses paying more attention to the only American on the political scene who makes any sense, Donald Trump? Could it possibly be because we scored higher on the math achievement tests and intelligence tests? You don't put any of this in the context of 9/11 as a False Flag Operation by Israeli-Neocons controlling the US government, which seems like you might not be paying attention to the important political things in America. Donald Trump hasn't mentioned that small event in the proper context either, so maybe that is why you don't appear to know about it? If peace reigns, Israeli-Neocons around the world hang for treason. Think that might have anything to do with events? Wed, 12/09/2015 - 19:00 | 6901795 Shizzmoney Trump and Zuck are both scam artists....its just which twisted version of morality they choose to uphold is the different variable of failure. Why are neoliberals getting scared?  Because Trump is the only person Hilary can beat in a general election? 'Xenophobia that Zuckerberg makes money off of in the first place'?  Huh?  You have to explain that AND provide a link. 'which twisted version of morality they choose to uphold is the different variable of failure'?  You will need to explain each, and how they are variables of failure.
