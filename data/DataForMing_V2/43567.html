Apple Warns Of "Material Financial Damage" If Its $171 Billion In Offshore Cash Is Jeopardized | Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! The airline has been working with its banks and the relevant authorities and understands that the funds â€“ less than $5 million â€“ have now been frozen. Although the sum stolen was relatively...

Despite the fact that Apple beat on both the top and bottom line on Monday on the back of better-than-expected iPhone sales (thank you China), and despite a near $20 billion increase in the company's massive cash pile which now stands at around $193 billion, shares have languised this week, falling around 5% post-earnings.  Now, we have a possible explanation for the weakness. As FT reports , the company's 10Q contains a warning that Apple could face "material" financial damage in the event the European Commission forces Ireland to reclaim a decade's worth of tax advantages that have accrued to the company under a tax deal that may have accorded it a "selective" advantage. Here's more:  Apple has warned investors that it could face â€œmaterialâ€? financial penalties from the European Commissionâ€™s investigation into its tax deals with Ireland â€” the first time it has disclosed the potential consequences of the probe. Under US securities rules, a material event is usually defined as 5 per cent of a companyâ€™s average pre-tax earnings for the past three years. For Apple, which reported the highest quarterly profit ever for a US company in January, that could exceed $2.5bn, according to FT calculations. The warning came in Appleâ€™s regular 10-Q filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday, a day after it reported first-quarter revenues of $58bn and net income of $13.6bn. Brussels has the power to order Dublin to reclaim 10 years of tax advantages granted to Apple if it finds that deals struck in 1991 and 2007 were unlawful. Both the Irish government and Apple have consistently denied any wrongdoing and declined to comment on the size of any fine. However, some Brussels officials suggest any ruling could set a new record for a state-aid investigation penalty by comfortably topping â‚¬1bn. Apple said in the filing: â€œIf the European Commission were to conclude against Ireland, it could require Ireland to recover from the company past taxes covering a period of up to 10 years reflective of the disallowed state aid, and such amount could be material.â€? Just how "material" is this "material" event for the maker of the newest, easily breakable wearable that's guaranteed to get you ridiculed by colleagues?

If that's true and they really did buy that much gold then I've thought all along the watch was just a scam they used to sell a few of them but to them take delivery of a massive amount of gold.  Maybe they were trying to accumulate while not starting a price or supply panic?  Wed, 04/29/2015 - 16:09 | 6043986 11b40 How many watches could you make with 700 tons of gold?

And with  all my Hereditary mental illness set aside,  I am of two minds about this type of blatant theft of private funds to be leveraged as public debt. Wed, 04/29/2015 - 16:41 | 6044141 CPL There have been four 'Cyprus' beta tests to date that have happened.  The only one where people got to keep their 'wealth' were the ones smart enough to jump into BitCoin.  The ones hoping for a magical stack of silver and gold to show up to transfer their millions and billions usually got fucked hard.  There just aren't enough PM's and the price is around 30000% under where it should be to match the economies people believe it's supposed to manage. There's roughly 21 million ounces of 'coin' gold. (priced at 1200 USD per ounce, total value 25,200,000,000 There's roughly 34 million ounces of 'coin' silver. (priced at 16 USD per ounce, total value 544,000,000 ) That's as fungible as that pool of money allows a global economy to run.  $25,744,000,000...that's not even remotely close to what's spent on energy in a week for the USA. 2013 nominal GWP was approximately US$75.59 trillion...see how 25 billion doesn't fit into 75 trillion?  Gold and silver aren't money anymore unless it matches the size of the economy it's supposed to manage.   The fiat isn't worth shit.  Two choices left.  The economic methadone called BitCoin.  Or Marxism (swap/barter system really) with a fully automated transaction system to manage trade directly...no people, just machines delivering on need versus warehousing and middle men requests.

It'll be a REAL eye-opener for all those companies and shareholders who thought it was all going to be "theirs"; its' really the banks'. And  everybody will  regret the lack of privacy and individual rights-'cause that banking/derivative house of cards has tracked every penny on the planet since 911, and it is a black hole that is greater than one QUADRILLION dollars at this point-and will suck everything  the earth into it.

Considering that the optics of value a round of silver buys two pounds of medium ground beef.  An round ounce of gold buys a used HVAC air conditioner.  That's been the price and that will always be the price of those PM's in terms of REAL value because the people managing that price and trade have screwed themselves out of it's investment potential.  Unless medium ground beef or a slightly used ac unit is an investment.  Which it's not.  The 'money' hold only the value of what it can buy.  Besides, the market is larger than 'kingdoms' now.  There are only two choices now.  BTC or marxism with systems automated trade management to directly trade goods for goods.

(what are laws, but the selfish preferences of the powerful minority?) And therein lies the problem with global governance. Unrelated parties, making decisions for their own benefit and against the decisions made by sovereign nations and peoples. Look at the abortion the EU has caused (100%) in Greece. Centralization always benefits the few at the expense of the many. It is a selfish folly generated by fear and unjustified ego.

I don't know, may be cut the buyback from $140 billion to $135 billion and send $5 to Nepal. A bit unconventional as a use of shareholder cash but buybacks are a waste anyway. If AAPL wants to fall to $100, it is going to fall to $100, buyback or no buyback.
