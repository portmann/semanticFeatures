ETF Hub Nov 16 2015, 19:49 ET | About: Herbalife Ltd. (HLF) | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor In its 13F filing, Soros Fund Management revealed it's bailed out on its Herbalife (NYSE: HLF ) bet by liquidating a near 2M-share position in Q3 -- likely at a profit -- and added stakes in Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) and Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ: WYNN ), as well as boosting Allergan (NYSE: AGN ) as its top holding . Herbalife is up almost 47% YTD as Soros and Carl Icahn lined up on the long side against bearish investors including Bill Ackman. The Soros fund also reduced its put holdings on the S&P 500, to 836K shares from 2.9M. Behind the Allergan add, Soros disclosed a $137.5M investment in PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL ) and ended the quarter with a $32.8M investment in Netflix , as well as $9.9M in Wynn. Aside from Allergan, the Soros Fund's biggest holding was in Adecoagro (NYSE: AGRO ). We've seen this movie before. Soros buys a couple million HLF shares then he adds another million. Then he sells it all. Then he's back in again. Then he sells it all again. Three months from now we'll hear he bought a few million again. No big deal.
