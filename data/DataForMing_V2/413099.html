Here's why bids for Yahoo are coming in low - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha May 23 2016, 17:20 ET | By: SA Eli Hoffmann , SA News Editor Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) bidders were unimpressed with the company’s due diligence materials, which is why they lowered their bids, two sector bankers say. Watchers anticipated bids between $4B and $8B, but expectations dropped to $2-3B, according to the Wall Street Journal . The lowball offers came after potential buyers saw information in Yahoo’s “virtual data room” as part of due diligence, causing them to reconsider valuation estimates, the bankers said. “They saw the data room, and sharpened their pencils.” One banker says Yahoo’s confidential information memorandum disconcerted buyers for several reasons: information was not comprehensive or detailed; business projections were “not compelling” and the ratio of revenue to EBITDA was “troubled.” Enough. At this point I have two points to make: 1 the blue dress bch is a bch so you don't have to prove it over and over again. 2: even at 2b Wall Street sons of bches don't ever dream about tricking me into selling my shares. If this bidding process falls through and no deal is struck, look out below.  You'll wish you had sold then, because sub-$20 is entirely possible.  And there won't be anybody else to blame. The real scandal of this YHOO management is that BABA has provided a smokescreen during MM's entire tenure. And the executives have milked it for as much as they could. What proof do you have that the bids are coming in light?  I hope it is not the WSJ article which has zero credibility.  You need to back up your article with facts if you want anyone to take you seriously.
