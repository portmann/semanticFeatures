Another Day Another Recall recall safety recall ford trucks f-150 brake issues While you can debate the best features in the many pickup trucks available, we can all agree that a feature no one wants are faulty brake lines, like the ones resulting in a new recall of 271,000 Ford F-150 trucks. Ford announced Wednesday that it had ordered the recall of 270,873 model year 2013 to 2014 Ford F-150 trucks after receiving reports of nine crashes related to brake issues. The company says the brake effectiveness in some of the vehicles could be reduced due to brake fluid leaking from the brake master cylinder into the brake booster, which increases the risk of a crash. The brake fluid leak affects brakes to the front wheels only and does not affect rear wheel braking. While the recall has not yet been posted with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the agencyâ€™s database includes several complaints about the issue from owners. â€œWhile driving approximately 60 mph, the brake fluid warning light illuminated,â€? one driver says. â€œWhen attempting to slow the vehicle down to come to a complete stop, the driver had to depress the brake pedal to the floor of the vehicle. The vehicle took longer than anticipated to come to a complete stop. The dealer diagnosed that brake fluid was leaking from the master cylinder into the brake booster. Both needed to be replaced.â€? â€œWhile driving along a city street the brake fluid level low message came on while at the same time the brake light lit up on console,â€? the owner of a 2014 truck wrote. â€œAt this point I had been depressing the brake pedal to the floor board to only marginally slowed the vehicle. I was able to get it to a safe location without incident. The dealer mechanic found the master cylinder had leaded and fluid drained into the brake booster.â€? Ford says it is aware of no injuries related to the nine reported crashes, but is aware of one injury involving interaction with the vehicleâ€™s brakes. Owners will be noticed of the recall and dealers will replace the brake master cylinder at no cost to the customer. Additionally, dealers will replace the brake booster if they find leaks from the brake master cylinder.
