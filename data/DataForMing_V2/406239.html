Is Apple Vulnerable Right Now? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha iPhone sales and overall revenues are declining from year-ago marks. While Apple is struggling to top tough comps from last year, there is no formidable competitor rising to the top. iPhone sales are tracking below last year's pace, while revenues continue to decline from a year-over-year perspective. Does this mean the end is near for Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and that its best days are behind it? A lot of it hinges on the next iteration of the iPhone. I'm not going to get into the conversation about Apple streaming, cars and splashy acquisitions. While some (or all) of these may come true, these catalysts are potentially years off in the future and right now, the outcomes are just speculation. In the first half of fiscal 2016, Apple sold 125.97 million iPhones, down 7% from the first half of 2015. Likewise, revenues sank 13% in the most recent quarter compared to year-ago results. At the midpoint, Apple guided for $42 billion in revenue this quarter, which would represent a drop of 15.33% from the same quarter in 2015. One could make the simple argument that there was so much demand for a larger screen iPhone that when Apple finally released the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, it spurred a frenzy of buying and drove up sales to near-impossible comparable levels for the following year. Along comes the 6s and 6s Plus, consumers like it but don't love it, and decide that after the holiday rush, they would rather wait for the new iPhone to come out later this fall. That's a pretty rationale argument, but a dangerous one at that. In this situation, we essentially have two outcomes. Either the iPhone 7 lights the world on fire -- like the iPhone -- consumers love it and the sun will rise the next morning. If the next phone is just another "token" upgrade, like going from the 5 to 5s or 6 to 6s, Apple could have a big problem. One very common, long overdone argument is "what will happen to Apple when the next best thing comes along?" As if Apple is some flash-in-the-pan tech company and not one of the most well-recognized, dominating forces in tech, (not to mention we've heard this for years). That's not to say it can't be dethroned some day, but I don't see it going the way of BlackBerry (NASDAQ: BBRY ). As of now, Apple's products are still very good and quite frankly, there's no formidable competitor to knock off Apple at the moment. When BlackBerry did turn lower, it coincided with Apple's rise. Notice in the chart below where BlackBerry's revenues topped out and when Apple's iPhone hit rapid growth, growing from ~40 million units in 2010 to ~125 million units in 2012. Currently, there is no formidable competitor rising while Apple's revenues stall. For me, that makes me think Apple's revenue decline is temporary and that the tech giant will eventually get back to raking in more cash. The risk here is that the iPhone 7 is a disappointment. Because so far, Apple hasn't found its new product category that will take it to the next level. Its services stream and Apple Watch are good, but they're nowhere near enough to stymie the bloodbath that would ensue should this be the end of the iPhone era. So while shares of Apple may be vulnerable (especially right now) as revenues decline amid tough comparable iPhone sales, I don't think the business of Apple is all that vulnerable, and that's what I care about as a longer term investor. Simply put, even if Apple failed to grow revenues from here on out, let's keep in mind this business is doing just fine. The company generated $234 billion in sales last year, up 28%! It would be foolish not to expect some sort of deceleration from those levels. Even flat growth would be impressive. Net income over $50 billion for 2015 is insane, and with a valuation as low as Apple's, flat growth for the company would eventually drive the stock price higher thanks to management's enormous buyback. Shares could be susceptible for more downside in the short- to mid-term, particularly if the market heads lower. But honestly, Apple is a very well-run company, if a little defensive at times, but its business is doing well and until a formidable competitor enters the smartphone fray, I don't see its run ending anytime soon.
