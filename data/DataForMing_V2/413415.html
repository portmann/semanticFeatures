Market Bias Is Bullish: Asymmetric Lemmings | Seeking Alpha I frequently hear talk about how "doomsayers or permabears" are constantly trying to get investors to take cover and hide. That may indeed be true, but the financial industry is fundamentally built on bullish biases, not bearish. On Monday May 16, equity investors were treated to a risk-on rally, allegedly borne largely on exciting news about Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ): Warren Buffett's Berkshire had taken a $1.1B position in the company. To quote CNN Money: Berkshire Hathaway ( BRKA ), the conglomerate run by Buffett, disclosed in a regulatory filing Monday that it purchased more than 9.8 million shares in Apple during the first quarter. It marks Berkshire's first investment in Apple. The shares moved up 3.7% for the day on the news and the broader averages followed, with S&P closing the day about 1% higher. Now I want to make clear that this article is really not about Apple. I have no meaningful opinions on the company or its stock. Full disclosure so that you have my two cents: I think that the company looks great from a valuation standpoint and I love its balance sheet, but from a technical standpoint it's looking like late 2012-mid 2013 all over again (crushing Apple losses suffered very swiftly). Like many, I have heard arguments for and against Apple as an investment; I think both sides make some good points. This piece is more of a spearhead article that will have some follow-up demonstrating that the media, most financial advisors, portfolio managers, commentators, and most investors carry a bullish bias, not a bearish one as is often claimed. I am using Apple as an example, and in no way mean to single out Apple investors as somehow more prone to this bias than other long position takers. Apple has offered us a fun view into how investors frequently take an asymmetric stance on bullish vs. bearish "sponsorship". Only about two weeks earlier from the Berkshire disclosure, billionaire investor Carl Icahn publicly announced that he had sold out of his position in Apple, causing the shares to settle 3.1% lower for the day, and taking the S&P down along with it. I find Mr. Icahn's explanation for his exit pretty interesting. Quoting from a Bloomberg news article : "We no longer have a position in Apple," Icahn told CNBC. Icahn sold most of his remaining stake in February, he said. "I got out because I'm worried about China." ..."if China was basically steady I would probably go back into" Apple, which he reiterated he viewed as a great company with great management. "I hope one day to get back into it." You can listen to the full interview from CNBC here . It's about five minutes and worth your time. If you objectively evaluate Mr. Icahn's statements, it is difficult to accuse him of deliberately looking to tank Apple shares. Carl Icahn took his first meaningful position in the company back in August 2013 (just when the shares began to recover from a huge dive coincidentally). His famous Apple tweets spiked the company's shares on many occasions: The $20-billion tweets; when Carl Icahn posts about Apple, markets move - fast Carl Icahn's tweet worth over $8 billion for Apple investors There have been numerous spikes (although frequently short-lived) to Apple stock specifically due to Mr. Icahn's talking of his book. If anything, his tweets come off as being more about pumping the stock higher than does his measured explanation for why he sold. Back in September 2015, when Icahn posted his YouTube piece "Danger Ahead" , he listed several reasons (political, monetary, and structural) for proclaiming that major stress may soon rack the broader financial markets. One reason he offers for his bearishness in the video is that many companies are engaged in irresponsible share buybacks. About seven minutes into the video, he specifically mentions Apple as the exception to the buyback rule. In the video, after warning about the dangers of foolhardy share repurchases, he says: Now, I have been a proponent of buybacks for companies like Apple where they're sitting with $200-billion in cash with very little debt, they should do buybacks; and especially with Apple at 9x earnings. On the same day that Mr. Icahn disclosed his liquidation of Apple shares, he called for a "day of reckoning" in the market. His response to whether he's still cautious on the markets: ...It doesn't keep me from investing and we have a lot of long positions, but then we have a huge short position on, and obviously (chuckle) the short position isn't doing that well as the market keeps moving up... Without giving all the details, Mr. Icahn tells viewers in a concise manner what some of his concerns are, and that he does have a meaningful short position for various parts of the market (he does not explicitly state whether he is in fact net long or short the market). He immediately follows his statement up with parts of the market that he finds attractive for long investors. So there you have it. You may or may not agree with Mr. Icahn's reasoning, or the nature, timing and motivation of his statements. But then if that's the case, you must immediately acknowledge that he also pumped Apple (and the broader markets) higher in the past on his tweets and announcements. He also didn't slam the company, its model, its management, or its valuation. He cited a specific reason for his exit, and claimed that he'd love to get back in at some point. Hardly what I'd call inflammatory. I've read several posts blasting Mr. Icahn in SA, as well as listening to CNBC and hearing similar kinds of comments in the day or so that followed. In fact, the next morning Warren Buffett interviewed with CNBC and downplayed many of Icahn's concerns. I'm pretty sure that Buffett is always net long and always does his darnedest to talk markets up. The weekend after Mr. Icahn's announcement, SA contributor Fear & Greed Trader had this to say about the billionaire: Carl Icahn's "Day of reckoning" remarks on Thursday didn't help the equity market, and he then specifically targeted Apple with more negative rhetoric. My guess he is short the market at the moment, and I find it amazing how the lemmings follow (emphasis added). I have no great complaint about F&G's statement here. But I will contrast the lemming portion of comment with his most recent narrative in my conclusion. In the comments section of the F&G article I mentioned, SA member Tiki Bar Capital ("TBC") had this to say (the statement was a portion of a larger comment, the rest of which I found quite good): 2. Carl Icahn: Icahn was absolutely, positively short the market when he made his "day of reckoning" remarks. CNBC should make these billionaire jerks disclose their primary long/short positions before letting them spout off on TV. Otherwise, the network is aiding and abetting market manipulation. For what it's worth I think TBC makes a lot of astute observations in the comment threads on this site. All the more reason that I think his sentiment represents classic bullish bias. Look at TBC's actual statement, there is nothing biased about it at all; he advocates that 'billionaire jerks' disclose their primary long and short positions. In fact I would love it if people voicing their opinions did have to disclose their primary long and short positions, or at least if there was some sort of link that readers or viewers could access that disclosed these positions. What I find interesting about the comment is not what he actually wrote, but why he wrote it. If you honestly read and listen to what Mr. Icahn had to say, there is little basis for claiming that he wanted to tank markets. My take is that TBC believes that these 'billionaire jerks' should have to disclose so as not to manipulate markets because he just doesn't like them being manipulated down. Up's just fine! This article (and those to come) attempt to demonstrate that structurally, politically, financially, and emotionally, most the market's bias is a -bullish- bias, not bearish. TBC's statement represents one instance of this phenomenon. I doubt that TBC took much issue since 2013 with the Icahn tweets mentioned above that pumped up Apple. In fairness, why would it? The whole point of the tweets was that Icahn was disclosing his purchase of the shares as a primary long position. But why telegraph that on Twitter? Maybe because he wanted to get a rise out of the markets? I'm guessing when hedge fund giant David Tepper caused the May '13 "Tepper tantrum" spike in stocks without disclosing the main positions in his book that this was very troublesome for TBC. I suspect that TBC was downright relieved on August 26, 2015 when the market jolted higher by 110 points within 24 hours, starting immediately after NY Fed Chair Bill Dudley (the patron saint of the financial markets) stated that "market turmoil makes September rate hike less compelling". For perspective, the S&P had careened lower in the prior two days (fell 50 points into the close on August 25). Now believe me, the purpose of this article is not to flay TBC for making one heated comment. I bring it up because there are -both- bullish and bearish forces that really do manipulate markets up and down. And the fact is that the majority of these forces actively work to push markets higher, not lower. Most "analysis" out there explains why you should be a buyer, not a seller. What I like about TBC's statement is that there's a certain unconscious indigence, as though when bulls jack prices up that's all well and good. But perish the thought of a 'billionaire jerk' disclosing the liquidation of a position, while couching it in the most congenial terms (almost like "I hope we can still be friends"..."It's not you, it's me."). Aiding and abetting market manipulation methinks..Release the hounds! This bullish bias is very real. Now I do not mean to say that asset bulls do not frequently have some legitimately excellent points, or that every statement that issues from a bear somehow represents objective research. No - NO. That is not at all what I am saying. The reason I am writing these articles is for the benefit of the reader: to help the reader understand that it is highly likely that THEY carry biases, and that in most cases these will be of the bullish variety. I will provide several evidences for this claim in forthcoming pieces. As a fun conclusion, I will quote Fear & Greed Trader's most recent piece: The S&P charged out of the starting gate on Monday registering a gain of 20 points as Warren Buffett shared the fact that he took a stake in Apple which was translated into an endorsement for equities. Remember earlier that F&G stated "My guess he (Icahn) is short the market at the moment, and I find it amazing how the lemmings follow." Now, no statement about market lemmings chasing the market up because Buffett paid an average of $109 a share back last quarter for $1.1B of Apple? Do lemmings only send markets tumbling, whereas astute investors gobble shares up on a "Buffett endorsement"? When does Buffett - not - endorse the market??? What sounds more lemming-like to you: A) selling shares down 3.1% for the day when you are given a verbal and explicit set of reasons for why an active Apple investor with a reasonably long track record for owning the company has determined upon careful examination that he finds a particular risk to be too large to continue holding for the time being. B) buying shares up 3.7% because a generic statement is released that a prominent investor decided to take what amounts to a small first-time stake in the same company at an average price of $109, no reasons given? As a tack-on, it's not as though this investor has had a lot of luck with tech picks (NYSE: IBM ). What tech picks would you say Buffett has had a real hot hand with? See the asymmetry in the commentary? And if it was just here or there, you could very easily accuse me of being a thin skinned nitpicker. But as a broad market bear, I see this all the time. It's not just F&G or TBC or Calafia Beach Pundit or Bill Miller, it's all of us, myself included. We tell ourselves the story we want to hear. Being a bear, I am more inclined to enjoy bearish headlines and perspectives, while picking apart bullish tongue wagging. We should be picking all of it apart - especially the stuff we like. Not just the stuff that we don't like. We should be looking for double standards and contradictions within our own investment philosophies. I see this in myself. I read articles by bulls that I could shred to pieces in real time, only to see people cheering on the narrative in the comments thread ("thought provoking and profound" "balanced and well reasoned"...me: no it ain't). I rarely am so critical of work that is more sympathetic to my beliefs about the markets. Does that sound like you? Despite our best efforts, we make much better cheerleaders than analysts. I hope you join me in future pieces as I offer you reasons and evidences in future pieces that demonstrate how and why market commentary is bullishly biased. My hope is that the effort will work towards making you the reader as well as myself examine analysis with greater scrutiny. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.
