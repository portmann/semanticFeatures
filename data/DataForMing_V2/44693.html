Apple: Zenith Behind Us, Nadir On The Horizon - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Despite strong sales in the March quarter, Apple began to shed market share again. By contrast, even before the launch of its exciting new Galaxy S6 Samsung regained ground with unit sales rising while iPhone declined. The Galaxy S6 should take share from the iPhone in the current quarter as may a new flagship expected from Xiaomi. Apple's bull run is nearing an end with neither Apple Watch or Apple Pay big enough to offset an expected decline in iPhone sales. Xiaomi sold 14 million of the 99 million smartphones sold in China in the first quarter, ahead of both Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ). Apple's 11% share, or about 11 million units, suggests Apple's Greater China iPhone revenue was less than $10 billion despite Apple reporting revenue from all sources in the region up 70% to $16.8 billion. I would not be surprised to learn that Apple's one million unit inventory build in the quarter was largely allocated to China. The results published by Xiaomi are in sharp contrast to claims based on Kantar Worldpanel data that Apple's China market share hit 27.6% in February. The Kantar data are useful for spotting trends but, since they are based on a survey of the same 15,000 persons each reporting period, the Kantar estimate of market share is really an estimate of the share at the margin of those persons in its survey sample buying a smartphone in the survey period. If smartphone owners upgrade every two years, the quarterly population of buyers surveyed by Kantar is approximately 1,875 and a one percentage point shift in "market share" reflects a buy decision by less than 20 people. Had Apple sold anywhere close to 27.6% of the 99 million iPhones sold in China in the March 2015 quarter, Apple's China revenues would have been substantially greater than the $16.8 billion the company reported. Trends in the China market are important. Last year, Xiaomi had 11% market share in China while Apple held 10%. Apple reported a 71% increase in Greater China revenue in the March quarter year-over-year, which is impressive given its market share grew by only 1 percentage point. It seems likely the higher Greater China revenue reported by Apple included a substantial portion of the 1 million unit iPhone inventory build Apple reported; higher realized prices; and, foreign exchange adjustments, as well as growth in non-iPhone products and services. Apple's impressive performance in China should come under attack this quarter with a strong reception for the Samsung Galaxy S6 taking some of the wind out of Apple's sales and an expected Xiaomi flagship waiting in the wings. The anticipated Xiaomi Mi5 is expected to sport a 5.2 inch display and a Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) 810 SoC which will compare well to the iPhone 6 Plus but no doubt at something like half the price. Apple's reversal of fortune may already be underway. After catching up to Samsung in the December quarter with its massive sales of 74.5 million iPhones, Apple's market share has begun to fall already with Samsung picking up the slack. In the March quarter, while Apple's iPhone sales fell to 61.2 million from 74.5 million in the previous quarter, Samsung's shipments actually grew to 83.2 million smartphones from being neck-and-neck with Apple in the Christmas period, according to a report by Strategy Analytics . That trend suggests the upgrade cycle to the new iPhones has stalled somewhat, perhaps in part a result of the impressive demand for the Samsung Galaxy S6 which outstripped even Samsung's expectations. Apple should nonetheless have a decent fiscal Q3 since overall demand for smartphones continues to grow and the margins on its iPhone 6 models remains very high. Having said that, the relentless weight of competition will eat away at iPhone market share and market growth will slow. The replacement cycle for iPhones is a two-edged sword - most of the phones replaced are simply retired with growth in the installed base much smaller than one might expect from the volume of new phones shipped. The population of iPhone users in 2014 totaled 410 million at year end; up from 336 million at year end 2013, according to data from Tomi Anohen's annual Phone Book , despite Apple selling 195.5 million iPhones during that year. Those data suggest 111.5 million iPhones were taken out of service in 2014 or 34% of those in use at the outset of the year. Applying a similar percentage to 2015 and I calculate some 139 million iPhone will be retired this calendar year. With an installed base that is a fraction of the Android ecosystem, the iPhone runs some long term risks. Android Apps now generate more revenue that Apple's App Store and that trend is running away from Apple in my opinion. A long time bear on Apple, I nearly became bullish with the surge in demand for the iPhone 6 but on reflection saw no reason to move away from my bearish stance with the aggressive reaction by top Android assemblers launching competitive devices every bit as good or better than the iPhone, with terrific devices from Lenovo; LG, Huawei; Xiaomi; and, now Samsung coming to market. In my view, Apple's best days for the iPhone are behind it. The iPad is in near free fall with sales down 29% year over year ; Mac sales pretty well stalled with 2% growth over 2014; and, services revenue growing at an anemic 9% rate in a market growing in the 20% range. At the end of the day, Apple is the iPhone and not much more. A few million units of Apple Watch or a few billion of consumer purchases through Apple Pay will not come close to filling the gap if iPhone volumes drop 20 or 30 million units annually, and that is what I expect to take place in the coming quarters.
