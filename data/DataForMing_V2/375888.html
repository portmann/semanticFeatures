Ask the Readers: What Are Your Tips for Healthy Eating? Eating healthy doesn't have to be difficult... if you know where to start. It can be a little intimidating to switch to more healthful eating habits if you're someone who is used to the convenience of fast food or microwave dinners, or you love the sinful decadence of fat-filled (or sugar-drenched) goodies.
