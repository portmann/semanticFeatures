Apple Wants You To Upgrade - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha New 4-inch iPhone targeted at older model iPhone holders. Refreshed iPad key to driving accessory sales. In the next couple of weeks, we expect to see a couple of new products launched by Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). Investors and consumers are looking for the company to launch a new smaller screen iPhone as well as an improved iPad. This slate of product launches is a little different from Apple's usual process, because in my opinion, it is not trying to get consumers to switch from other products. This March, Apple is all about trying to get holders of its older products to upgrade, in an effort to reverse some sales declines for its two most important products. As I discussed in a prior Apple article , management detailed on the January conference call that 60% of iPhone holders had not yet upgraded to a larger screen phone. There are plenty of consumers who appreciate the smaller size and lighter weight of a 4-inch phone like the 5s and previous models. However, with Apple not launching a smaller phone in some time, this user base wants improved hardware. For Apple, getting consumers to upgrade helps strengthen the While the smaller iPhone is important, an upgraded iPad may be more important to its specific product line. While iPhone sales are expected to decline in the current quarter, they've still done extremely well in recent years. We cannot say the same about the iPad, with the chart below showing how unit sales of the tablet have fallen for eight straight quarters. Source: Apple financial information page The most recent quarter saw the steepest drop. In my opinion, that happened because Apple did not refresh the iPad Air and instead launched the iPad Pro last fall. With the larger screen Pro costing more and likely being supply constrained upfront, this helped cause a 5.3 million unit sales decline over the prior year period. The launch of a new iPad, rumored to not be in the "Air" category but a new branch of the "Pro" line, should help ease some of these sales declines. Working off of smaller base numbers should also help moving forward. Since the launch will be late in the quarter, there probably won't be a lot of sales of this new model until the June ending quarter. Increasing sales of the Pro and this newer model will help reverse average selling price declines we've seen in recent years (mostly thanks to the Mini). But these two models will do more than just go for higher prices, they help to drive sales of accessories, like the Pencil and Smart Keyboard. Especially with this soon-to-be-released model, driving accessory sales is key to really boosting revenues. A $99 Pencil sale adds nicely to a $1,000 Pro sale, but in percentage terms it adds a lot more to a $500 regular model sale. I'm also curious to see if Apple considers an iPad upgrade program . Apple is about to launch a couple new products, with the main goal this month to drive upgrades. The new 4-inch phone will be in high demand from older iPhone holders, which should strengthen the ecosystem through the increased adoption of Apple Pay. A new iPad will help to ease tablet sales declines, and the ability to add on accessory sales will help provide added revenues. These new products will be the key to near-term results for Apple, helping to bridge the gap until larger product launches come this fall. *Image Source: Brett Jordan (via Wikipedia) Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.
