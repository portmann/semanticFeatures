Ford: Earn 3.8% While You Wait For A Coming Move Over $20 - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford continues to jog in place, but all the while offering a nice yield. 220k announced recalls hit the wire last week, pressuring shares yet again. Ford (NYSE: F ) continues to park itself around $16, near where it was when we first started covering it. For months, we've been suggesting to our readers that Ford has a long-term possibility of making it to $28.50 per share over the course of a longer term investment horizon. It pays an attractive dividend that almost makes the stock worth owning by itself. Specifically, we've noted that international expansion and the new F-150 and Mustang models will help drive sales for 2015-16. For the longer term picture, we see a reliable balance sheet and continued yield, which should both help keep Ford stock on steady footing as it continues to grow. Over the course of the last 3 and 12 month period, the stock has been in a trading range, rarely touching lower than $13 or higher than $17.50. Shares were under pressure earlier last week into Thursday on the news that the company was issuing three recalls that totaled over 220k vehicles. Seeking Alpha reported that, Recall #1: 213K Ford Explorer and Ford Police Intercept vehicles from the model years 2011 to 2013 are recalled over a interior door handle issue. Recall #2: The automaker recalls 1,725 Lincoln MKT limo and hearse vehicles from the model years 2013-2015 over a vacuum pump problem. Recall #3: An exhaust gas sensor issue is the prompt for a recall for 6,472 various Ford F-Series ambulances. We think this recall will have little effect on the company and the fact that shares were under pressure due to recalls on vehicles not even primarily used by the company's everyday consumers leads us to believe that this pressure could be yet another opportunity to purchase. These are specialty recalls, which won't deter Ford's main growth objectives: growth in Asia and its new F-150 and Mustang models. To give an example of the company's actual momentum in 2015, estimates are, Ford's market share is forecast to be 15.1% vs. 14.3% in February and 15.8% a year ago in March. Incentive spending by Ford -14.3% Y/Y and +3.9% M/M to $2,864 per unit vs. the industry average of -1.3% Y/Y and +0.4% M/M. Market share is on its way up with incentive selling going down means margin should improve in the coming quarters, benefiting the bottom line. This could help be the fuel to move the stock price up and over the $17.50 resistance level, which we think is the key to the stock breaking out. To continue growing, the company recently invested $1B in a "new plant in Western India that will help it triple its exports from the country." This growth should compliment its growth in Asia, two of the most densely populated places on the planet. The plan for India to grow alongside China is to make India an export hub. In the meantime, as the company's stock continues to fade, it's now paying its highest yield since the financial crisis. F Dividend Yield (NYSE: TTM ) data by YCharts Trading at just 8.5x what the company is expected to earn next year is just one thing that makes this stock attractive. At a 15x P/E, Ford would be trading at about $24, more towards where we think it should be valued. Despite our thoughts on the value of Ford's growth, it remains at a P/E that's on the low end of peers, who trade between 8x and 12x forward earnings. As you can see from the above chart, the major breakout point for Ford is going to be above $18 to $18.50. We expect to see the stock move through this fueled by overseas growth and innovation with its products. When we do, we don't think it will be long until we see $20. There, we may have to wait for the next leg up, but we believe over the course of the long term we will have based on our way to $28.50.
