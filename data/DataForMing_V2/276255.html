AMD: Multiple Catalysts Will Drive A Double In 2016 And Another Double In 2017 - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) | Seeking Alpha The long downhill march of AMD’s stock price is about to change direction. New money, new contracts and Zen’s release will drive 2016 price higher. Zen’s desktop production will make 2017 AMD’s first profitable year since 2011. I have written 8 articles about AMD (NASDAQ: AMD ) since March and everyone has been about their long-term potential to hit $10. The first on March 5 was titled " 10 Reasons Why AMD Will Be $10 By 2017 " and the last one published on Dec. 2 was " 10 More Reasons Why AMD Will Be $10 In 2017 ." To say it has been a bumpy ride over the last 10 months would be to put it mildly. Executives have changed, cash has shrunk, sales have dropped along with margins and market share keeps dropping. So what is the good news? Executives have changed (for the better), $320 million is on the way, sales and margins have nowhere to go but up and market share in graphics has inched up with desktop and server to follow when Zen is in production. Others must agree with me because the price has risen over 30% since Dec. 2 from $2.23 to $2.95 on Dec. 24. In this my 8th article on AMD, I will provide a rough timeline defining how I see the price going to $10. 2016 Q1-Q2: Joint Venture (JV) deal with Nantong Fujitsu (NFME) is completed and AMD receives $320 M in cash thereby assuring future development of Zen. In October, AMD announced an agreement with Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics for the sale of 85% of its SATS (Semiconductor Assembly and Test Services) facilities for net cash of about $320 million. See AMD: Cash Infusion Means It Is Time To Buy This Beleaguered Laggard for more on the subject. 2016 Q2: The Radeon 400, AMD's first 14NM FinFet GPU (Arctic Islands) is released for production starting in the 2nd or 3rd quarter. "We are also focused on delivering our next-generation GPUs in 2016 designed to improve performance per watt by 2X compared to our current offerings, based on design architectural enhancements, as well as advanced FinFET process technology." Q1 2016 through Q4 2017: OPEX and CAPEX savings will improve cash flow by at least $100M per year. The ATMP (Assembly, Test, Mark and Pack) facilities are capital intensive so CAPEX relative to the ATMP facilities should be decreased. According to CFO Kumar, CAPEX should be down a total $40M in 2016 (per transcript). Also, the transferring of 1,700 employees (about 18% of AMD employees) to Natong will decrease operating costs significantly. CFO Kumar mentions $58M in 2016 OPEX savings not including JV savings which are yet to be determined. So total savings on CAPEX and OPEX including the new JV will certainly be well over $100M in 2016. The agreement also calls for no overall cost increase for AMD's use of the JV's ATMP services. While still a rumor, it appears increasingly likely that Nintendo, with console sales of over 500 million units, will be contracting with AMD to produce a new semi-custom SoC (System on a Chip) for their new console/controller. I am not sure how much sales will be generated by these AMD ARM chips but since AMD's current market share of the server market is about 1.5% anything would be a plus. Also amortizing the sunk cost of all the R&D that went into ARM development would be another plus. Here is a good explanation of how the new servers will be used. The big Kahuna in AMD's stock price increase is the successful release of their new x86 chip Zen. The release is scheduled for 4th quarter 2016 (CPU) with the APU (CPU+GPU) sometime after that in 2017. The longtime performance gap between Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) and AMD is going to shrink considerably and this will result in improved sales to OEMs who have been waiting for AMD to produce a competitive product to offset Intel's price monopoly. As of now, AMD competes only at the low end of desktop and laptop chips, but with Zen, I think they compete for at least 80% (mid to high end) of that market instead of the current 20% (low end only). Combining Zen with HBM and new GPUs could create a monster APU in 2017 called "Exascale Heterogeneous Processor" or EHP. This would be a high-priced, high-margin product. No one makes much margin selling to Apple but the PR would be outstanding if Apple decided to switch x86 vendors. One advantage AMD has is it could design a semi-custom x86 SoC to Apple's exact specs as opposed to Apple buying the stock Intel I-Core products. Apple uses AMD graphics cards now in its high-end Macs. Finally, in 2017, AMD will once more have an opportunity to excel in the server market. At this point in time, Intel has 98% and AMD 1.5% of the market. That is because the current AMD offerings called the Opteron Series have a fraction of the horsepower of the Intel server chips as seen in the following chart. But Zen will change all that and AMD will get a lot more than 1.5% of the server market starting in 2017. I have been an enthusiastic supporter of AMD for almost a year now. As time has passed, I have become even more enthusiastic for all of the reasons listed above. And I have not included the many possibilities from the GPU side of the business either. My point is if most of these come true, even if I am off by a quarter or two, AMD's stock will soar based upon the anticipation that profits, and maybe significant profits, are on the horizon. And this does not include the possibility of a spinoff of the graphics division or an investment/acquisition by a 3rd party. Now is the time to buy because as each of these catalysts tick off, the price will rise some more. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
