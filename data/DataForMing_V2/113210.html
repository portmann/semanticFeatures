Google And Yahoo Search Partnership May Add Shareholder Value - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha Google and Yahoo could be on the cusp of another search and ad partnership. Yahoo can offer up to 49% of search queries to Google, which will give Yahoo a blend of Bing and Google search results. This type of deal should get past regulators and is a healthy alternative to developing a compelling search algorithm in-house. Of course, incremental victories like this will not impact the stock by much given the disproportionate value of Alibaba. Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) could be looking to ink another search partnership. This will add value for both Google and Yahoo shareholders. Google will gain more search query share and will get a portion of Yahoo's digital revenue. However, Yahoo can lower its R&D cost and provide a broader mix of search results. There have been times in the past where Yahoo and Google worked together. I think it was circa 2000 where Google first approached Yahoo with its search technology, and upon implementation from Yahoo's homepage, it became widely known that searching the Internet rather than looking through the Yahoo directory was more efficient. Fast forward a couple more years, Yahoo had realized that it made a huge mistake and attempted various large-scale acquisitions to be at the forefront of search and dropped Google from the homepage. By 2005 it became excruciatingly obvious that Yahoo was never going to catch up, and a couple years later Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) came banging on the door with merger papers. Of course, Yahoo was never taken private as the top executives over at Yahoo barricaded the front doors and engaged in back-office corporate warfare with Steve Ballmer (yeah the former CEO of Microsoft who now owns the LA Clippers). Couple years after that, Microsoft and Yahoo came to terms on a deal circa 2010. This was after Yahoo attempted to make a deal with Google circa 2008, but was blocked by antitrust regulators and various advertisers who were opposed to a fully completed monopoly between the two providers. Of course, Yahoo was struggling on the back of falling engagement and the lack of investment into search technologies, so a quick fix was to piggyback off Google's universal search algorithm, which was deployed circa 2007. Google invested substantial resources to develop universal search, and today we dismiss the technology as a nice to have. It was what pivoted Google's dominance across news, maps, and various other web based apps. So we fast-forward to 2015, and now Marissa Mayer who is the current CEO of Yahoo and a former Google exec whom presided over the Search Unit is looking to work together with Google rather than compete directly with them. Like they say, history doesn't repeat itself, but it sure likes to rhyme. Yahoo confirmed on Wednesday that it has begun testing the use of Google search ads for a small portion of its desktop and mobile web search results. "As we work to create the absolute best experiences for Yahoo users, from time to time, we run small tests with a variety of partners including search providers," the company said in a statement. "There is nothing further to share at this time." Yahoo got the right to work with other search providers in April when it renegotiated its partnership with Microsoft, whose Bing search service had been the exclusive provider of search results and ads to Yahoo under a 10-year partnership between the companies. From my perspective, it's not exactly clear weather Yahoo will actually get a deal done or if it's just testing the level of engagement with Google queries in comparison to Bing and its own in-house search algorithm (assuming it has one). When you reach the scale of Yahoo even a marginal improvement in engagement is enough to generate millions of dollars in incremental revenue and earnings. Furthermore, websites tend to focus their search engine optimization efforts on Google because it's the most dominant search property in the world. Therefore, retrofitting Yahoo Search could add value to Yahoo shareholders while lowering costs, so Yahoo can focus on developing other web properties or pass those savings onto shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends. What's interesting is that Yahoo can feature a combination of Google and Bing search queries on its Yahoo Search page. Based on the recent deal restructuring with Microsoft, Yahoo can use 49% of its queries with other search partners, which will address the stipulations of the various laws governing anti-monopolistic practices. However, it's not exactly clear whether Yahoo would sell ads via its Gemini platform or through Google Double Click. Ad networks have lost some leverage in response to programmatic ad bidding, which is another level up from the bidding networks that aggregate some of the web ad-inventory, but not all of it. So, the various silos aren't the most cost efficient, and when you reach the level of programmatic it's similar to an open exchange for commoditized ad-units across the entire HTML and mobile-based web. It's pretty exciting stuff, but it's not yet clear whether Yahoo's Gemini can secure more favorable rates or if it's just another network that's bound to get consolidated into the broader industry wide consolidation of ad inventory. For the most part, the stock has been on a persistent down trend and whatever Yahoo does on the Search front isn't material enough to move the stock in either direction. This is driven by the overwhelming value of the Alibaba stake that will soon be spun off to shareholders. For the most part, the spin-off will add value, and while a recent scare indicated that a tax-efficient spin-off would not be feasible, the rumors ended up being rumors, and there are various alternatives, according to a Reuters report . What really hemorrhaged value over the recent weeks has been the persistent decline across Chinese equities, and while one could argue that Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) is a stalwart among Chinese stocks, and doesn't trade on a Chinese exchange, there's no denying that confidence issues pertaining to asset values could negatively impact e-commerce volume across Alibaba's portfolio of web properties. Furthermore, consumer confidence does matter in this context given the sheer scale of Alibaba and the fractured nature of commerce in China. That being the case, I'm not knocking on Alibaba, but until Yahoo is able to spin off the value from its Chinese assets, it's hard for Yahoo's financial performance to be measured from incremental victories like in the case of the renegotiated Yahoo and Bing partnership. I will be very interested in Yahoo following the spin-off because I think it will unlock the intrinsic value of Yahoo core when it's floated separately on the Nasdaq. Needless to say, I'm still bullish on Yahoo and I'm a long-term bull on Alibaba. I think a deal with Google will be a win for shareholders but will spark concerns over Bing's growth. Yahoo only has 10% of search market share in the United States. Of that, Google would only get half of the queries and Google would receive a small portion of Yahoo's profit from search. Therefore, the deal isn't going to generate substantial value for Google shareholders. However, adding some of the market value from the remaining queries on the Internet plays to Google's core strength as a search provider, so the marginal revenue from Yahoo would not come with much marginal cost. So from an economics standpoint, Google would generate some value - it just doesn't move the needle by much given the company's sizable revenue base.
