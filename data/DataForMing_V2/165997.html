M&A Daily: Intel Clears Key Altera Hurdle - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Sep.  8, 2015 11:38 AM ET  |  About: Intel Corporation (INTC) , Includes: ALIOY , ALTR , ARIA , AVOL , BXLT , DEPO , HZNP , MYL , PCP , PRGO , RDUS , SHPG by: Chris DeMuth Jr. Soon, Intel will have Altera inside. The HSR waiting period for the Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) acquisition of Altera (NASDAQ: ALTR ) expired. M&A Daily has been tracking this deal. Clearance is a step forward, but the deal still requires approvals in China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. The $3.93 net spread offers a 14% annual return between now and next April. This remains one of my favorite arbitrage opportunities. The preliminary proxy was filed for the Berkshire Hathaway ( BRK.A / BRK.B ) acquisition of Precision Castparts (NYSE: PCP ). The $4.83 net spread offers a 5% annual return between now and next March. Horizon Pharma (NASDAQ: HZNP ) commenced an exchange offer to acquire all Depomed (NASDAQ: DEPO ) common shares. The current offer's $0.77 spread offers a 5% annual return between now and next April. Mylan (NASDAQ: MYL ) also made their offer formal. They are proceeding with their attempt to acquire Perrigo (NYSE: PRGO ). The $7.42 net spread offers a 12% annual return between now and year-end. Shire (NASDAQ: SHPG ) management is looking at possible takeover targets such as Radius Health (NASDAQ: RDUS ), Actelion ( OTCPK:ALIOY ) and ARIAD (NASDAQ: ARIA ) if its effort to acquire Baxalta (NYSE: BXLT ) falters. The $1.70 net spread offers a 7% annual return between now and next April. Bohai Leasing filed their definitive merger agreement related to their proposed acquisition of Avolon (NYSE: AVOL ).
