4 Stocks You Want To Avoid Before Interest Rates Rise | Seeking Alpha An interest rate hike is imminent, likely before year's end. Some stocks will thrive, others will suffer when interest rates rise. Just about every large financial institution has issued its list of good and bad stocks for after the Fed raises interest rates. The Fed delayed an interest rate hike for September, but is insisting that a hike will come this year. Therefore, it's natural for investors to start asking which companies have the most to lose when interest rates rise. While the list may be long, here are four large companies that come to mind more so than any other. First and foremost, I am looking at companies with a large debt load, lots of floating-rate debt, and companies that might need more debt and therefore affected by higher financing costs. Furthermore, the stocks that made my list are those that have used debt freely over the last decade, while interest rates have been low, yet still have many questions surrounding their business. Thus, these companies not only present risk from an interest rate stance, but also a business risk, and have a likely need for further financing in a high risk environment. VZ Revenue (NYSE: TTM ) data by YCharts If not for spending $130 billion to have full ownership of its Wireless business, Verizon Communications would not have made this list. But by doing so, Verizon's debt has increased from $50 billion to more than $113 billion since 2013, which is why its 10-year increase looks so high. Furthermore, had Verizon actually gotten something valuable for that $130 billion, it probably wouldn't make this list. However, just after Verizon spent all that money, an all-out price war in the wireless space broke out, and competitors Sprint (NYSE: S ) and T-Mobile (NYSE: TMUS ) have essentially targeted all growth-related initiatives towards stealing Verizon and AT&T (NYSE: T ) customers. VZ Free Cash Flow ( TTM ) data by YCharts Nevertheless, that $130 billion acquisition, which was supposed to drive free cash flow higher has not worked out as planned. Instead, free cash flow has declined more than 50% during the last five years. Looking ahead, Verizon's decline in free cash flow means it has to seek financing to fund certain activities like spectrum acqusitions, and with interest rates rising, and Verizon's debt already so high, VZ is quite an investment risk. FOSL Revenue ( TTM ) data by YCharts Fossil Group's debt increase relative to revenue growth is mindboggling. With less than $700 million in debt, it's not that Fossil's debt load is unmanageable. However, 23% of Fossil's market cap is variable rate debt, and like Verizon, margins have fallen quite significantly for Fossil, making debt payments more difficult. Perhaps the bigger problem is that Fossil operates in a watch business that is changing quickly. The company has already partnered with Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Android Wear, yet has failed to unveil or produce a lineup of smartwatch products. Meanwhile, smart and basic wearables are growing rapid, stealing share from Fossil, and that's one reason FOSL has declined nearly 50% this year. In essence, interest rates are rising, Fossil still has a large debt balance to pay, and most importantly, the need to increase debt to fund R&D and marketing for a new line of products is likely. In other words, things could get worse for Fossil before getting better, and that means its stock could go lower. DISH Revenue ( TTM ) data by YCharts DISH Network's Charlie Ergen has made no secret that the company has taken advantage of a low interest rate environment to fund strategic investments over the last few years, which is evident by the above chart. That's good and all, but the problem is that DISH now has $13.7 billion in debt and needs to make moves that'll cost billions of dollars, and it can't. First off, AT&T's acquisition of DirecTV created a pay-TV juggernaut that DISH has to compete against. Also, DISH's most valuable asset is a large spectrum portfolio that is essentially useless. Therefore, DISH needs to find a way to compete against this new pay-TV juggernaut and put its spectrum to use. Most think that "way" is an acquisition of T-Mobile , but where and how could DISH afford it? Nevertheless, DISH needs to make a big move, and higher interest rates are going to pose a challenge. Given the questions that surround DISH's competitive position in pay-TV and its unused spectrum, DISH is particularly risky ahead of higher interest rates. Last but not least, McDonald's debt to assets ratio has steady risen to well over 50% in recent years to fund strategic investments, yet still there are serious questions surrounding innovation, consumer traffic, and how the company plans to grow amid a wide-spread shift to fast-casual and healthy dining. Ultimately, more debt is a likely outcome as McDonald's tries to address these questions. With McDonald's already possessing a large chunk of rate floating debt, according to Goldman Sachs, no increase in debt would be particularly good for the restaurant giant. After all, higher interest rates are already going to increase the amount that McDonald's owes to creditors, and if forced to raise more debt, it will be tough to imagine the company's balance sheet becoming strong once more, or its stock for that matter. All things considered, it is hard for me to imagine that any of these companies increase in market valuation once interest rates rise. Not only does each company have legitimate questions surrounding their respective businesses, but all have large debt loads and are likely to need additional debt to address these noted questions. With an interest rate hike being imminent, I see no reason to own any of these stocks now or later. Disclosure: I am/we are long T.
