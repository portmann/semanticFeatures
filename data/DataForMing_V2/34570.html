To What Extent Does The Apple Watch Affect FY 2015 Results? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple Watch shipments will likely slow due to supply constraints, however, 15 million units seem feasible in FY 2015. I anticipate an ASP figure of $661.57 as the data point will likely skew due to higher-end models that appeal to a more affluent base of users. I anticipate gross margins to exceed 50% for the Apple Watch and net profit margins in the range of 30% to 40%. This will affect sales and earnings meaningfully in the current fiscal year, which is surprising given the sizable base of revenue and net income anticipated by sell-side analysts. After having done extensive research, I believe that the upcoming Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Watch will impact sales and earnings meaningfully, based on preliminary reports on supply chain, consumer surveys and income distribution. Based on the aforementioned analysis, I believe that the Apple Watch will meaningfully impact Apple's full-year FY 2015 results, which will force the consensus EPS and revenue range to trend even higher. Also, if earnings and outlook beat, the stock will respond positively. Therefore, investors should pick up some additional shares in the foreseeable future. Clearly, many on Wall Street feel that speculating on future growth, revenue and earnings isn't a recipe for success. "Foresight" is bad, but being an "intrinsic" evaluator is good. But the fact is, even the cheapest businesses are based on some sort of cumulative free cash flow, net income or sales prediction. Here's the truth: creating a projection is more art than science. Sure, there are various methods one can use to improve the odds of success, but at the very end of the day, I've heard a lot of cases where an analyst will piece together whatever numbers necessary to get the board's stamp of approval, even on acquisitions where a company doesn't generate any profit and little in revenue. This is normal business practice in Silicon Valley. So a healthy dosage of skepticism is perhaps welcomed. However, I'm fairly confident that the Apple Watch will add meaningfully to both top line and bottom line results. Here's what I stated earlier in the year: When extrapolating from first year shipments of first generation products, I arrive at the projection of 42.43 million Apple Watch units for the first year. So, in the 12 months following launch 40-50 million units may be sold, but the impact to FY 2015 will be closer to 20-25 million units. Admittedly, my assertions may have been a little aggressive as supply side risk was going to be the greatest constraint on revenue, which I explain in detail in a recent article . Ming-Chi Kuo also mentions that supply chain issues will limit supply in the initial months, so I'm not alone in that observation. Kuo notes that Apple plans to expand the supply chains for Apple Watch, with the Cupertino company targeting production of 2 - 3 million units per month. However, they estimate that the potential bottlenecks in production could be the vibrators that power haptic feedback from AAC and AMOLED displays supplied by LGD. So if we operate under the assumption that the first month will generate around 3 million units in sales, and the remaining five months for FY 15 will average 2.5 million units, the company may generate 15 million units in volume before the end of FY 2015. So my earlier estimate put me off by around 5 million units, which is OK, because I operated under the assumption that ASPs would be $400. Instead, the ASPs are likely higher, as the higher-tiered models are priced higher by a factor of more than 20, so there's room for skew in the statistical distribution of price points. So after doing extensive research on the distribution of income, and the likely price points that income sensitive consumers will likely shop at, I have created a table that shows the distribution of price points. I anticipate an average selling price of $661.57, total revenue of $9.923 billion and 15 million in shipment volume. I believe that income will be a key determinant in consumption, so therefore, the buyers with a sub-$35k income will likely buy the lower-tier models, whereas the individuals who earn over $100k will by all along the product stack, inclusive of higher-tier models that sell for $10,000 to $17,000. Because price points are so wide, the bias is to the upside when it comes to ASPs. I anticipate gross margins to be north of 50%. However, it's hard to determine what gross margins are going to be until third-party research firms like IHS release their figures. Also, operating margins are going to be phenomenal as the added overhead cost of another product category will be combined with the R&D and SG&A expense that covers Apple's other products. In other words, Apple's foundational investment in display technology, semiconductors, displays, sales, etc., will create some cost synergies with the Apple Watch. Management has indicated that both R&D and SG&A aren't going to increase very meaningfully year-over-year, so there are further legs for Apple to surprise analyst estimates, especially if this infant product category can drive net profit margins of around 30% to 40%. For a company like Apple, the sizable base of revenue and earnings makes it difficult for new products to drive earnings or sales. But in this case, I anticipate that if the Apple Watch adds $3 billion to $4 billion to bottom line, the impact would drive EPS figures that would exceed analyst estimates for the full year. Admittedly, there's always the risk that survey data isn't actually indicative of demand and various other factors diminish the amount of production for both low- and high-end units. Also, because lines won't be made at the retail store, it will be hard to gauge the level of excitement for the product or come away with clearly conclusive evidence on consumer uptake. Despite these factors, I'm still optimistic on the potential impact it will have on both earnings and revenue. As you can tell, I can barely contain my excitement when it comes to Apple's future revenue and earnings prospects. Being growth oriented, these two factors drive my optimism and it's also what drives my analysis. Very rarely does the market misprice the value of a stock but when it does, you stop asking questions, and start buying the stock. By now, I'm probably preaching to the choir, and the rest of you will sing over me in the comment section. Source: To What Extent Does The Apple Watch Affect FY 2015 Results?
