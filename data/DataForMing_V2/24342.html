Apple And Wearable Devices: Moving From A Want To A Need By 2020 - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apr.  9, 2015  5:06 PM ET  |  About: Apple Inc. (AAPL) by: Matt Margolis As an investor and analyst in technology companies my focus is on where Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Watch and wearable devices are headed by 2020 and beyond. Yesterday, I shared my opinion of Apple's first generation Watch entitled, " Apple's Watch" Exquisite Design, Undersized And Not For Me ." I also indicated that I believe Apple will sell between 10m and 20m watches in 2015. One of the first major hurdles to successfully commercialize any new innovative product is selling the product benefits. However, in the case of Apple your audience is hundreds of millions current, former and potential customers who have already purchased or are looking to purchase an Apple hardware device. When it comes to mobile devices, whether it's a smartphone or smartwatch, the benefits are catered around the user experience. I'll admit that I am a big fan of technology and innovation but I'm an amateur when it comes to using Apps on my Apple 4s smartphone and my iPad2. Outside of investment, personal banking and commerce apps I've only downloaded a handful of apps including an emoticon app, a picture collage app and a weather app. Apple developers have been busy submitting apps for the Apple Watch with over 1,000 apps already submitted for approval. To put this in perspective there are over 1 million iPhone apps available today and over the last three years I've downloaded less than 50 apps. Additionally, I'm very satisfied with my smartphone experience and currently don't see a need to upgrade my iPhone to or download hundreds of apps I will never use. The first generation Apple Watch is sexy and fun but I don't believe the user experience will be overwhelmingly positive in 2015. The Apple Watch can tell time, show alerts and messages but why should I pay $350 or more for another device to deliver the same information I'm already receiving on my iPhone 4s? If you are a health and fitness guru you will need to drop $350 or more on another monitoring device that comes with an atrocious battery life and lacks wireless charging. If you are an investor in Apple or any of its watch suppliers our focus is on 2020. By 2020 Apple will be selling well over 100m watches annually and sales of the device could even exceed 250m units annually. You might be wondering how a device that I'm not impressed with today will grow from 10m units sold in 2015 to over 100m or even over 250m units by 2020? My simple answer is the IoT (Internet of Things) and to be more clear it is as a result of our always connected, always on lifestyles. Apple's Watch is catered toward health monitoring and fitness. However insurance companies and healthcare providers will take a few years to test drive the equipment and implement changes to how patient care is delivered. At the end of the day by the year 2020, insurance companies will have to recognize Apple's Watch as well as other wearable devices as approved medical devices. Insurance company subsidies will help fund the purchase of millions of wearable devices that will not only improve patient care but also help bend the cost of healthcare. Insurance subsidies will be a major driver of future Apple Watch sales by the year 2020. The tipping point for Apple's Watch will be turning its target market from want to need of its technology led by engagement with major private and public healthcare providers and healthcare professionals around the globe. When a device turns from a societal want to a need, industry sales and technology adoption explode. The adoption of new cutting edge technology also can have a lasting impression on workforce productivity and corporate profits. Smartphones and tablets have changed our daily lives forever but the next wave of wearable devices will take us places at work and home that we never thought were possible. I would argue the success of the smartphone drove me to buy an iPad because I needed a larger portable device that could provide a more satisfying internet experience. The success of wearable devices to impact our daily activities at home or work will determine the adoption and ultimate success and failure of wearable devices including Apple's Watch. Apple's Watch provides a potential solution to much need societal need focused on improving the quality of our lives. However, it will several years for the infrastructure investments within the pubic and private sector as well as the adoption of new technology to turn Apple's Watch and other wearable devices from a societal want they are today in 2015 to a need by 2020.
