Twitthoo? yahoo internet merger twitter talks taking the meeting As Yahoo prepared to dissect a second round of bids for its core internet business â€” including search, mail, and news sites â€” the company might have another proposal to ponder: a merger with Twitter.Â  The New York Post, citing the all important sources close to the matter, reports that TwitterÂ officialsÂ met with Yahoo executives several weeks ago to discuss a possible marriage between the social network and one-time Internet biggie. The meeting, which apparently lasted several hours, focused primarily on Yahooâ€™s financial and whether or not a combined company would fit in with the future of tech. â€œTwitter is the destination for instant news, and Yahoo has a lot of eyeballs on its site,â€? said one source. â€œThe idea isnâ€™t as crazy as you might think.â€? However, the NYPost reports that a merged company may not be championed by all involved, as Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey wasnâ€™t actually involved in the meeting. â€œWhen your CEO doesnâ€™t show up for a management meeting, you have to wonder how serious it was,â€? the source said. Yahoo declined to comment on the meeting, while a Twitter spokesperson said the company doesnâ€™t comment on speculation or rumor.
