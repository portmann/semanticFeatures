So, no, Third Avenue shareholders, you canâ€™t have your money back and you canâ€™t really sue. But perk up, Buttercup, allâ€™s not lost. The SEC has extracted for you the right to see just how badly your investments are doing on a daily basis. The deal with the SEC means investors will continue to be blocked from withdrawing their investments in the fund and may not receive all their money back for months, if not more, as the fund slowly sells assets and returns cash. But the investors, who are expected to receive a first cash payment today, now will be able to see updated, daily net-asset values for their holdings, something they wouldnâ€™t have been able to obtain had the assets remained in the trust. Third Avenue wonâ€™t charge a management fee as the fundâ€™s assets are sold. abracadabra , better late than never? , client screwing , Hedge Funds , Mutual Funds , SEC , SEC: looking after investors since 1934 , Third Avenue Marissa Mayer Probably Should Have Seen The Irony In Her $7 Million “Great Gatsby”-Themed Yahoo Holiday Party FBI Arrests Martin Shkreli On Fraud Charges, Because Karma Isn’t A Statute Blythe Masters Has Big Wall Street Suitors Lined Up Around Her Blockchain Bill Ackman Thanks Investors In Advance For Going Down With The Ship Sandberg: I Got Something Out Of My MBA, And You Might Too, But Don’t Get One, Unless You Want One, But Not Because I Told You To Minority Shareholder Spends 99-Pages Telling Yahoo Why Marissa Mayer Is Literally THE Worst “The Big Short” Is Wall Street’s Answer To Star Wars Emo Bro Martin Shkreli Blows $2 Million On Sole Copy Of New Wu Tang Clan Album Because He Is Desperate To Bang Taylor Swift Whatever Doesn’t Kill Commodities Hedge Funds Makes Them Stronger Judgeâ€™s Model Spits Out 45 Months In Prison For MIT Professor Of Hedge Fund Fraud 162430No commentshttp%3A%2F%2Fdealbreaker.com%2F2015%2F12%2Fthird-avenue-gets-permission-to-do-that-thing-it-already-did%2FThird+Avenue+Gets+Permission+To+Do+That+Thing+It+Already+Did2015-12-17+18%3A48%3A01Jon+Shazarhttp%3A%2F%2Fdealbreaker.com%2F%3Fp%3D162430 High-Frequency Monitoring: A Short-Sighted Behavior The more frequently you monitor your portfolio, the more likely you are to observe a loss.
