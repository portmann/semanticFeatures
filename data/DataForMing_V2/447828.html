Wal-Mart: Amazon/Netflix Overlap Implies Tremendous Opportunity For ShippingPass - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) | Seeking Alpha WMT recently revamped and expanded ShippingPass to look more like an abridged and cheaper version of Amazon Prime. There is a significant overlap in Netflix and Amazon Prime's sub bases. This overlap implies tremendous opportunity for ShippingPass to disrupt the market. Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) recently revamped and expanded ShippingPass, the retailer's response to Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Prime. ShippingPass now looks a lot like an abridged and cheaper version of Prime, offering unlimited, free 2-day shipping on select items for $49 per year. It is also no longer invite-only. ShippingPass doesn't offer any of the additional perks of Prime, like access to music and video streaming services, but the cost reflects this (half the cost of Prime on an annual basis). We argue that ShippingPass will provide immediate benefits to WMT, and that this benefit will likely coincide with increased Amazon Prime churn. On its face, Amazon Prime offers a much more compelling value proposition than ShippingPass. Prime offers a streaming video service and free shipping on 30 million products for $99 per year. A Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) and ShippingPass combo membership would cost $158 per year, and ShippingPass offers free, 2-day shipping on only 1 million products. While there are several hidden costs with Instant Video (several of the movies aren't included with Prime and have a rental fee), Prime still looks like a more compelling value proposition than the Netflix-ShippingPass combo. This analysis, though, assumes that Netflix and Amazon Prime are mutually exclusive (you either have one or the other). The truth is they are far from mutually exclusive, and this is to WMT's advantage. In the US, UK, and Germany, half of Amazon Prime's members also subscribe to Netflix . The reason for this overlap is ambiguous. The content offerings of Instant Video and Netflix are unique, with each service having its own content niche. Richard Broughton of Ampere research notes the following: Netflix has focused on drama, action, crime and comedy, while Amazon Prime skews more toward documentaries, family and children's movies. Amazon also has a focus on older titles - 18,000 movies and 4,500 TV shows to Netflix's 11,300 movies and 5,500 TV shows. We argue, though, that the reason for the overlap is how consumers view Amazon Prime. Amazon Prime's main benefit is the free shipping perk, not a half-free video streaming service or any other under-used perk wrapped into Prime. Data actually seems to suggest that a significant number of Prime subs do not make use of those additional perks, so there is a large market of consumers paying $99 exclusively for a free shipping benefit. While Prime Music has "several million people" using it, that is a fraction of the 40 million Prime sub base. The consensus seems to be it is a value-added service , but it simply isn't used by a majority of Prime subs. Usage of Instant Video implies a similar conclusion. Some data suggests that 40% of Prime subs solely use Netflix (meaning 4 out of every 10 Prime subs do not use Instant Video at all). In other words, consumers are using Prime mainly for its shipping perks, not for the video or music streaming service wrapped into the membership cost. Those consumers now have the option to subscribe to a service that offers free shipping for half the cost. To the 40% of Amazon's ~40 million members who solely use Netflix (16 million members), it makes economic sense to drop Amazon Prime and pick-up ShippingPass. Those consumers won't miss any of the perks that come with Prime outside of free shipping (because they don't use them), and they will reap almost identical benefits for $50 less per year. Because of the tremendous overlap in Amazon Prime and Netflix sub base, we think there is tremendous opportunity for ShippingPass, priced at half the cost of Prime, to disrupt Prime and provide immediate benefits to WMT. We are unsure at this juncture how much market share ShippingPass will consume, but it seems like it could steal up to 16 million members from Prime.
