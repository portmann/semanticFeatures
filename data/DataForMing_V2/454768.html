null An Airbus A350 is pictured at the ILA Berlin Air Show in Schoenefeld, south of Berlin, Germany, May 31, 2016. FARNBOROUGH, England Virgin Atlantic is set to announce an order for at least 10 of Airbus's (AIR.PA) biggest twin-engined plane, the A350-1000, on the opening day of the Farnborough Airshow on Monday, industry sources said. An order of that size would be worth more than $3.5 billion at list prices. A deal would be a shot in the arm for a 366-seat model promising greater efficiency but whose sales have slowed as rival Boeing (BA.N) develops a larger version of its 777. Airbus and Boeing have enjoyed years of strong demand, helped by rising airline travel particularly in Asia and the Middle East and new, more fuel-efficient planes. But analysts are concerned that economic risks -- from slowing growth in China to Britain's move to leave the European Union -- could see orders dry up and some even canceled, particularly for costly long-haul jets. British Prime Minister David Cameron will also attend the show on Monday, when he is expected to finalize multi-billion dollar deals with Boeing to buy nine P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol planes and to upgrade 50 Apache helicopters.
