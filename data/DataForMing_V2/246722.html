Walt Disney Co. (NYSE: DIS ) is set to mark the beginning of a new fairytale, bringing opportunities with strong momentum and promising returns for investors. And yes, all includes us as well; those ready to take the leap for DIS, because the timing is right and so are the forecasts for long-haul investments. If we call Disney the eye candy of the market right now, it won't be an exaggeration and certainly not baseless. The California-based entertainment and mass media broadcasting giant is composed really strong right now, with a number of strategic plans about to bear fruits on multiple fronts. These include a remarkably strong ground set for the release of new Star Wars movie (The Force Awakens) coupled with the historic opening of Disney Shanghai, a promising project in itself and the strategic shift of the company to diversify its broadcasting licensing and creating a direct link with end-subscribers. Disney continues to trade at forward price earnings (PE) multiple of 20X, representing 54% premium relative to its peers trading at an average forward PE multiple of 13.1x. However, with best portfolio of assets in the industry, accompanied with strategic diversification in its licensing and consumer exciting content in its pipeline, we believe that the premium is justified. We continue to reiterate Disney darling with the Outperform rating and a target price of $130, representing an upside potential of 9.24% from Monday's closing price of $119. From once upon a time to happily ever after! Disney is banking on the opportunity to thrive on increased revenue opportunities by creating buzz on multiple fronts, including theatre earnings with new content for 2016/17, increased sales for consumer merchandise along with increased attractions in its parks and entertainment segments. The company is in ideal stage to push all the buttons to its maximum capabilities because the time is right for them. We believe that LucasFilm content will be a significant growth catalyst for the business. We have estimated revenues for the five main movies to be $7.4 billion, which includes on average $1.8 billion for main movies and $1 billion for spin-offs, accompanied with lifetime EBIT of $4.2 billion. The following table illustrates our estimate for future revenues. Figure 1 Source: Company Data, PVR Estimates However, it is not just about the new Star Wars movie or the upcoming Star Wars video game or the increased sales of consumer merchandise, but it is all of these factors combined together and more. Together these product lines and their measurable marketing returns are impacting positively on other avenues of the business. Moving forward, we believe that DIS will easily be able to protect its adjusted EBITDA margin in the range of 32% to 35%, backed by strong trends observed in Cable Networks' operating margin stabilizing above 40% and substantial expansion in Studio Entertainment's operating margin. Another interesting twist in the plot of this fairytale is the organization's definitive take to license the off-network shows to multi-channel video programming distributors (MVPD) or directly to consumers via user-friendly apps. Bob Iger's comment that the company is interested to grow the business through new channels and with new brands is a clear signal that the organization is to explore the unexplored channels of broadcasting and licensing. This particular strategy shift is a promising avenue for investors as Disney plans to create unprecedented links with consumers directly. On Demand Subscription To World's Most Loved Tales Now that the company has decided to swing in favor of multi-channel and application services providing direct access rights to end consumers who are the real celebrators of Disney's magical content, there are long-term growth opportunities and revenue streams for the company. The company is locking in four years of transition phase in favor of direct-to-consumer access from SVOD, which will balance off the rate of subscriber losses in long term and would have positive returns. Investors should respond positively to this strategic shift of the organization in favor of increased and easy access to end subscribers. Iger in a statement said that "off-network programs will end up either being bundled with our multi-channel services or as part of apps that [we] sell direct to customers." This is an indication for a composed long-term strategy that will generate direct consumer sales, the base numbers of which is the ultimate whooping billions. DisneyLife would then be the direct-to-consumer subscription streaming service with an eye popping attractive content from Disney's Pixar catalog, books and music. The content would be made available via an app available on mobile devices. The technological shift in favor of mobile would also attract the millions of subscribers who prefer mobility of entertainment as compared to its traditionalism. Moreover, mobile platform could then become the hot engine for the marketing of Disney's mind-blowing consumer merchandise. This would mean another revenue stream that can both lock in growth and be able to strengthen other streams of business growth simultaneously for years to come.
