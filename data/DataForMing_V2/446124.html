Wal-Mart steps up challenge to Amazon Prime - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) | Seeking Alpha Jun 29 2016, 12:57 ET | About: Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) | By: Stephen Alpher , SA News Editor In test mode since last year, Wal-Mart's ( WMT +1.3%) Shipping Pass - like Amazon's ( AMZN +1.2%) Prime service - offers unlimited free shipping on many online purchases. Wal-Mart today aims to bring Shipping Pass to a wider audience, offering a fee 30-day trial for the service. As for price, Shipping Pass is just $49 per year vs. Prime at $99, though the Amazon service includes perks like music and movie/TV-show streaming, special deals, and one-hour delivery in certain markets. Hey Walmart Prime - don't forget the music, movies, free storage, awesome customer service, next day delivery when available, etc., etc., like Amazon Prime.   Good luck with that. Walmart's $49 just for shipping seems rather high when you consider all the extras included with Amazon Prime -- streaming movies and TV, books and music.  I think Walmart's shipping would only be worth $25 at best to me by comparison.
