AMD Exposes Its Lack Of Competitiveness At Computex - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) | Seeking Alpha At Computex, AMD announced the launch of Polaris GPUs, but didn't provide a firm timetable for Zen CPUs. Polaris falls well short of competing Nvidia cards in performance, which is reflected in AMD's pricing of the Polaris-based RX 480 graphics card. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) made a number of announcements at Computex about its upcoming CPU and GPU products, but the defining moment of the presentation was when Raja Koduri, head of Radeon Technology Group, revealed the lack of performance of the new Polaris GPUs. In the chart below, he showed that it will take two Polaris GPUs to get slightly better performance than a single Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) GTX 1080. Lacking a high-end product that can compete with the best, AMD is now embarked on a "race to the bottom" strategy that will deprive the company of any hope of profitability. Koduri's chart, while self consciously obscuring the performance of the new Radeon RX 480 card, based on Polaris 10, revealed the marketing strategy going forward for AMD. AMD would now seek to "democratize" gaming with a $200 card offering the best performance for the price. The RX 480 may well offer the best performance for the price. Without comprehensive reviews, we won't know that for sure until the NDAs are lifted on Jun 29, when the 480 is due on store shelves. Based on Koduri's chart, it appears that rumors that Polaris 10 would offer performance equivalent to the previous generation R9 390X look to be about right. Assuming that's the case, at $200, the 480 will offer the best performance per dollar available. At this point, there's probably little question about the value proposition of the card. Undercutting its competition on cost is probably the only strategy left to AMD. But this leaves AMD just trudging down the same path that it has been on in competing with Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ). This is not a path to profitability. The main reason it isn't has to do with the Nvidia GTX 1070. Although Koduri made the comparison with the top-of-the-line GTX 1080, the less expensive 1070 has been pre-positioned by Nvidia to take on Polaris at a lower price point. As the table below shows, the two cards are very similar in basic specs. Reviews are already out on the GTX 1070. After a brief survey, I have found that WCCFtech's review to provide fairly typical results. I won't go into the details, since this isn't a tech review, but in every benchmark the GTX 1070 scored better than the R9 390X. The 1070 was even better than the top-of-the line R9 Fury X in every benchmark except the now famous Ashes of the Singularity for DirectX 12. Assuming that the RX 480 performance comes in somewhere between the 390X and the Fury X, the 1070 will still be the better card for most games. I think this makes the value proposition of the RX 480 considerably less compelling for gamers, even at the $229 price point. However, I think it's reasonable to assume that the RX 480 will sell in large numbers, and that AMD may even make good on its intention of gaining GPU market share. That market share gain will come at a very high price that AMD can ill afford. AMD has lost the top end of the market to the GTX 1080. In the September quarter, AMD's unit volume of GPUs may increase sequentially, but GPU revenue and margin can be expected to decline. AMD now finds itself in graphics where it has been so long in processors: struggling to be performance competitive, and having to sacrifice margin on behalf of maintaining some market share. It's a losing strategy. The state of Zen shows just how bad things can get once performance leadership has been lost. At Computex, CEO Lisa Su held up one of the Zen samples, and once again we heard that Zen will supply a 40% increase in executed instructions per cycle. AMD's Zen-based Summit Ridge will be the first Zen processor, and will be aimed at performance desktops with eight cores and 16 threads. Basically, all AMD has done is replicate the performance improvement that Intel achieved with multi-threading. Zen is unlikely to do more than catch up to the current generation Intel Skylake processors. We still don't know when Zen will arrive. AMD would not confirm a launch date, saying only that samples would be more widely available to OEMs in Q3. In the past, AMD has stated that Zen would launch by the end of the year, but now the company isn't willing to commit to even that. With major foundries such as Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) and TSMC (NYSE: TSM ) moving to 10 nm by early next year, I consider it highly likely that Intel will move up its schedule for 10 nm production ramp to the first half of 2017 from the previously announced second half. This leaves Zen with almost no window of opportunity before new 10 nm Intel processors arrive. For each of the products AMD announced at Computex, the company could have provided real benchmarks that would have allowed comparison of its products with its competitors. It didn't do so for what is probably the simplest reason. It knows its products fall short. The only option left to AMD is to low ball its prices. Investors have to ask themselves if this can be a winning strategy. It hasn't been so far. AMD doesn't have the production scale and volume to be profitable with its current gross margin of 32%. That margin is very likely to erode further in Q3. AMD has already guided to a margin decline to 31% for the June quarter. For Q3, I expect it to fall below 30%. AMD's stock price has ratcheted up recently, confirming my expectation that there are still plenty of investors willing to drink the Kool-Aid . Computex showed that AMD is finally running out of Kool-Aid. I still consider AMD a short opportunity. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
