eBay Takes A Step In The Right Direction - eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) | Seeking Alpha eBay had a severe flaw when compared to Amazon.com. A flaw I had already highlighted in a previous article. However, an incoming change is bound to eliminate this flaw. Five months ago, I wrote an article titled " Why Does Amazon.com Keep Cleaning eBay's Clock? ". In this article, I explained one of the reasons why eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY ) kept on losing to Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ). The reason I identified was that Amazon.com listed its wares starting from a product page paradigm, whereas eBay listed them on an offer paradigm, perhaps due to its roots in auctions. The obvious problem with eBay's approach was that each different offer by each different seller was a different listing. So while Amazon.com might have 100 sellers selling the same product in a single product page, eBay would have 100 different pages with offers on that same product. Obviously, this made specific product offers difficult to find. If you searched for a given product and ordered the results by price, for instance, you'd see tens of pages of similar products by different sellers. This created a never-ending chore to find the right offer which made buying less agreeable. On top of that, of course, it also made it harder to cleanly compare different offers on the same product by different sellers. If you missed a term in the description, you'd simply not get all available offers, perhaps even hiding the best bargains for that product. Also importantly, since there were no product pages, it became hard for eBay to carry reviews on those same products. And thus reviews become an Amazon.com advantage. People want to see reviews, people flock to Amazon. This created the risk that upon seeing the reviews, lazy as consumers are, they'd simply buy the product there. Which in turn led to it being easier to sell at more expensive prices on Amazon.com. Which in turn attracted the sellers wanting to access those higher selling prices. That is, while many times it was cheaper to buy on eBay, since it was harder to find the bargains, many consumers didn't even try. And eBay threw away a possible competitive advantage. Seeing what I described above, I said that eBay could do something about it - it could substitute its "offer-based" paradigm with a product-page paradigm similar to Amazon.com's. I also said that it shouldn't be too hard, that sellers used to also selling on Amazon.com would quickly get used to it. As it were, eBay is taking a step in doing exactly what I said it ought to do. As per ChannelAdvisor , from June 29 (Monday next week) eBay will be requiring product identifiers. The relevant quote from ChannelAdvisor is this: eBay forewarned of this in the 15.1 seller release, but starting June 29, product identifiers - including brand name, manufacturer part number (MPN) and different global trade item numbers (GTINs), such as UPC, EAN or ISBN - will be required for new listings of branded items in new and manufacturer-refurbished condition within many categories. It might seem a small change, but this is all that eBay needs to create product pages just like Amazon.com's. And I am certain such will happen right after the listings carry the relevant information. In quick succession, this will help product discovery. It will also quickly enable a decent review system, which should rapidly be populated by eBay's large customer base. And finally, it will be a boon to consumers trying to find the best bargains. eBay has done what I said it ought to do, and this is a positive for eBay. I expect the June 29 change to bring about product pages, better search and a better review system. As a result, I expect eBay's competitiveness to increase versus Amazon.com (all other things being equal). Indeed, this should also allow eBay's greater price competitiveness (cheaper goods) to shine through, whereas those were previously hidden below thousands of similar offers. In short, this is a positive for eBay. Source: eBay Takes A Step In The Right Direction Disclosure: I am/we are short AMZN. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
