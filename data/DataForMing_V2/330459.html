Disney: Is Too Much Of A Good Thing A Bad Thing? - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha The outsized importance of ESPN is a big part of that problem. Disney (NYSE: DIS ) shares have fallen more than 20% from their mid-2015 highs. With the very public success of the latest Star Wars movie, that might seem like an odd turn of events. Only the company's heavy reliance on ESPN easily outweighs one good move. And ESPN appears to be hitting a snag. Is ESPN as big a deal as it seems? Disney's Media and Networks division, which made up around 45% of the company's overall revenues last year (about 40% in the fiscal first quarter), is also pretty profitable. It provided a touch over 50% of the company's operating income in fiscal 2015 . EPSN is the largest piece of that division, accounting for about 70% of Media and Network revenue last fiscal year and almost 90% of its operating income. In other words, problems at ESPN are problems worth watching. The problems that have investors worried are subscriber losses and increasing costs for the live content that feeds all of the channels under the ESPN umbrella. That said, ESPN dominates the sports segment overall. And it still has huge clout with the cable providers that distribute its content. So ESPN isn't exactly falling out of bed. For example, revenues were up 9% year-over-year in the fiscal first quarter at the cable group despite the subscriber concerns. Operating income, meanwhile, fell 5%, but that was related to increasing content costs that will eventually anniversary and, likely, be forgotten about if revenues remain strong. So the shock that's led to investors shunning Disney shares is really the realization that ESPN isn't a tree that will grow to the sky more than some sort of death spiral at ESPN. At roughly 45% of revenues and half of operating income last year, the Media and Networks segment is an issue worth watching closely. There are two broad scenarios here to the downside: a slow decline and a catastrophe. So far it hardly looks like ESPN is facing a catastrophic scenario in which subscribers and revenues go into free fall. In fact, the nature of the cable business suggests that a rapid decline is highly unlikely. That's the good news. The bad news is that the ESPN business is so profitable that Disney may be resistant to change with the media times in a slow decline scenario. In other words, it won't go direct to consumers or try alternate distribution ideas quickly enough because it doesn't want to upset the cash cow it has in place. That type of complacency has killed many businesses. The flip of that, however, is that it has long-term contracts in place for the content it distributes. This is valuable content and as long as Disney can shift gears at some point, it will remain the biggest player in the sports space. So, even if it's late to change, the value of the content shouldn't decline and that could give it time to react and/or rebuild. This, then, isn't a situation like AT&T (NYSE: T ) and long distance. That was a hugely profitable business, but technology changes destroyed its fundamentals. It's highly unlikely that a shifting delivery mechanism for video content will destroy the value of a live football game to which Disney owns the rights. The other thing to keep in mind is that while Disney relies on ESPN for a big portion of its financial results, there are other dominant businesses inside the media titan. Unlike AT&T which was almost completely reliant on long distance, Disney has movies, resorts, and a very valuable licensing business that make up around half the company. (Note that even AT&T eventually managed to shift gears, toward cell phones in this case, though it eventually got swallowed by a regional bell company that took on the AT&T name.) That's not to suggest that Disney could simply pull out ESPN and still be the same company, but that Disney has a collection of highly valuable assets that couldn't be replaced (Mickey Mouse, Marvel, Star Wars, etc.). If ESPN is weakening, these other businesses will help to soften the blow. In some ways, ESPN showing some weakness could actually be a good thing if it jolts the company, and investors, out of complacency. Clearly investors have taken notice, but whether or not Disney does, and acts on it, is something only time will tell. I'd argue that the purchase of Marvel and Lucas in recent years are a clear indication that Disney knows the importance of content and recognizes that it needed to build up other parts of the business before ESPN got too big. (In fiscal 2010 , the Media and Cable operations provided roughly two-thirds of segment operating income.) Honestly, Disney appears to be doing a better job of keeping at least some balance in its portfolio than other companies with similarly important assets. Look at Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), for example, where the iPhone is the driving force behind the entire company. The iPhone accounted for a massive two-thirds of the top line in the fiscal first quarter. The iconic company's attempts to build up other areas simply haven't gone nearly as well as hoped (iPad sales have struggled, it hasn't disclosed results for its watch, and its Apple TV effort has been pretty weak). I think Apple has plenty of time and money to deal with the issue, but the business breakdown at Disney simply appears more favorable. So, in the end, Disney does have an ESPN problem. But it likely has plenty of time to deal with it unless there's a very sudden change in the media world. That doesn't appear in the cards today. So the bigger question may be how and when Disney has to start dealing. In some ways the sooner the better, but in others a quick shift would upset the current business model. For now, shareholders should give the company the benefit of the doubt. Others, meanwhile, might want to start looking at the shares now that they've sold off some. Indeed, a further decline could be a long-term buying opportunity. Disclosure: I am/we are long DIS, AAPL. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
