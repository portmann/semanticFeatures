Yahoo, NFL make live-stream history - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha Oct 25 2015, 10:38 ET | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) is in the middle of live-streaming today's Jaguars-Bills matchup for free, marking the first NFL game to be available  primarily over the Internet. The move is symbolically significant for the NFL, which wants to start experimenting with digital distribution, and likewise for Yahoo, which has become very interested in Web video under CEO Marissa Mayer. Let's see how many times we receive broadcast buffering issues.  The only good thing is both Jax and Bills are terrible, so you might not have a large demand to watch. Well after watching for a quarter, I have to admit the quality is not bad.  It's not as crystal as HDTV, and occasionally it looks like you're watching thru a Coke bottle because it auto adjusts the stream based on bandwidth availability. I truly think that both AAPL and GOOG execs are watching carefully if it makes sense to go after this market in the future.  If it does, they'll easily outbid YHOO for the rights to air the games like DIRECT TV has done for years. How many times you had buffering issues? I count zero. Think long term here -- combine yahoos ability to live stream games w their fantasy / daily fantasy franchises and you have an extremely powerful and differentiated offering. Yahoo has a ton of issues but this represents a bright side. Not arguing your point that it is great stuff on the streaming.  And by the way, 1 screen buffering since the hour or so watching with top of the line computer/CPU and highest speed UVERSE internet. My point is YHOO doesn't have the deep pockets to bid away from their competitors.  They would have to partner with the likes of an AT&T who now owns DirecTV.  Franky, AT&T can do this without YHOO. You are probably right about the big buys taking it away, but at least Yahoo delivered a very high quality broadcast and presentation. There may be multiple other companies that would like to have the ability to do this live streaming and would be interested in acquiring Yahoo. Yes, good job for YHOO today on a professional broadcast which offered Spanish and Yahoo Sports Blog announcers on SAP.  Others don't need to acquire YHOO for this technology.  GOOG and APPL already do it far better.  I do believe that YHOO needs to be relevant.  Maybe a merger with TWTR? Yes, good job for YHOO today on a professional broadcast which offered Spanish and Yahoo Sports Blog announcers on SAP.  Others don't need to acquire YHOO for this technology.  GOOG and APPL already do it far better.  I do believe that YHOO needs to be relevant.  Maybe a merger with TWTR? There is some leverage for YHOO in that they are the first, and also pushing Fantasy Football and Fantasy Sports. Now it's about the strategy. These first broadcasts are of "throw away" games the Networks won't pay for. Makes perfect sense so far. MM has a reputation to make... or break. Good Luck. $20M for this garbage game? Mayer is so in the 9th inning - nobody cares about NFL London anyway... If it wasn't for fantasy sports Yahoo and the NFL might be nothing... and yet we're all here talking about YHOO and watching so we can offer our crit! Worth the $20 Mil right there IMO Great quality, no buffering issues. This will change sports watching completely. I can be anywhere there is wi-fi and watch. I see sports fans out and about watching. This broadcast is absolutely fantastic. Quality in every device excellent. I'm watching on my 60" smart tv via Roku and Yahoo screen. It's just as good as a normal Sunday NFL broadcast. Might not be as interesting because it is Jaguars and Bills, but everything about the broadcast on multiple devices is excellent.  This is a very good demonstration of Yahoo's ability to produce and stream a live event. i watch a fair amount of streaming content, ( foodball is not something i waste my time with) and seldom have streaming issues. We all know you hate Yahoo and believe it's going to zero, but so far this streaming experience and broadcast production is stellar. YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING? Money in sports is a phenom I don't understand either but "step aside", this is bigger than your interests. When a sport can win out against head trauma and occasional deaths, you think whether you watch streaming sports matters? This is investment not emotion and this was a bold step taken before anyone else.....and from the results stated here could make it the SAVIOR of YHOO. No bashing.... we know your opinion but it's wait and see for me. Long and may add to my holdings. Can always sell calls against it. This is so nice I hope they stream games more. Nfl and yhoo need to figure something out that works for both sides In a quick comparison, I would say they are putting bandwidth preference to streaming devices rather than on their website.  The video quality is much better streaming through an apple tv than from my PC and their website.  I'd grade it as a good B on apple tv and a low C on my PC when comparing to high def broadcasts' A grade. Apple TV - some brief dropping of frames and the FPS is noticeably reduced. Things I wouldn't notice with proper beer and popcorn accompaniment. There appears to be tearing (rendering issues) on the Yahoo! interplay graphic which should be cleaned up. PC via website - Resolution continually changing sometimes as blurry as video in the late 90s ranging all the way back to the Apple TV quality.  But constantly varying with a cycle frequency of about every 2min.  The bottom of the image is smeared downward likely to accommodate the screen size versus broadcast resolution.  Not sure how to describe it but the bottom 2% of the video is just smeared downward.  As the resolution varies throughout a cycle, the smeared region returns to normal at the highest observed resolution. All and all if the streaming is consistently as good as observed on the Apple TV, this match up of Yahoo! and live media (sports) seems fine enough indeed. This is one of the most exciting games you could watch.  Might be two lousy teams, but the game is exciting. Turning out to be a GREAT game.  I bet the viewership is pretty good and it stayed good throughout the game, since it is now only a 3 point game with 6 minutes left. This is only the first step for yahoo to get into this business, I think this 20million is well spent. Now, they need to monetize this and make it profitable! I think yahoo finally has something going. My mistake, I meant monetize with better revenue. Remember saw from somewhere they had to drop the price from $200,000 to 100,000 per ad or something like that. Maybe they will negotiate better terms! Yes, it's already happening as most, especially Millennial generation, are using Netflix and Hulu.  You can do so much more with stats and different camera angles with streams on the Internet which evententally will come on traditional cable or satellite, albeit slower rollout.
