Boeing's Backlog And Strong Fundamentals Bode Well For Its Future - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Strong performance metrics indicate competent management. Free cash flow generation is healthy, earnings quality ratios indicate solid underlying business. Despite lowering guidance last quarter, Boeing (NYSE: BA ) managed to beat estimates on both the top and bottom lines, while also revealing an impressive backlog of $489 billion. The company is now half way through its fiscal year, and I'd like to examine it as a candidate for investors looking for a long-term core position for their portfolios. The first thing I'd like to look at is return on equity, and what's driving it. I grabbed some numbers from Morningstar to compile the below DuPont Analysis. We can see that Boeing's ROE has been erratic over the last few years, but margins were clearly higher for fiscal 2014, which is encouraging. I used end of year equity and assets for year-over-year comparisons, but below I'd like to examine ROE using average equity, and also stack it up against the company's return on invested capital and return on assets. All data is from Morningstar. We can see that ROE has decreased significantly over the last 5 years, but this is largely due to a decompression in the firm's financial leverage, per below. ROIC on the other hand has been solid over the last five years, which indicates a solid management that's proficient at allocating capital. It should also be noted that return on assets is at a five year high as well. These facts, coupled with the fact that the main reason ROE dropped over the last five years was mostly due to a decrease in the firm's equity multiplier (indicating less business risk), tells me that Boeing has only gotten better over the last five years efficiency-wise. Next I'd like to look at Boeing's earnings quality ratios. Data from Morningstar, compiled by Joseph Harry The company has managed to generate consistent increases in free cash flow over the last five years. Despite a slight deterioration in the firm's FCF/NI ratio over the last few years, it's still a dramatic improvement, as free cash flow continues to comfortably exceed net income. Operating income has also shown a sustainable upwards trend over the last five years. This, taken into consideration with the increase in net income and free cash flow, indicates a strong underlying business. Boeing last reported July 22, which marked the mid-way point throughout its fiscal 2015. So far, revenues for the first six months have increased by an impressive 10% y-o-y. Net earnings, however, have slipped 7% y-o-y, which translated to only a 1% drop in earnings per shares. More encouragingly, operating cash flow has increased by 16%. Despite capex being almost 34% higher for the first half of this year compared to last, the jump in operating cash led to higher free cash flow, which came in at $2,119 millions. This was an increase of roughly 7%. I care more about free cash flow than I do earnings, so to me this was an indication of continued strength in Boeing's underlying business. Boeing's guidance still shows expected operating cash north of $9 billion for FY2015, with capex coming in at about $2.8 billion. Free cash flow therefore should fall in at somewhere around $6.2 billion on the low end. I personally expect it to be higher than last year's, especially since it's already outpacing last year's figures. As of June 30th, Boeing had about $9.2 billion in cash and equivalents on its books, which exceeds the amount of total long-term debt it carries. The firm also has adequate working capital, and overall the balance sheet sustains solid liquidity. BA Debt to Equity Ratio (Quarterly) data by YCharts Looking at solvency ratios, investors shouldn't be too alarmed by the company's high debt/equity ratio, because this is typical of firms with financing units such as Boeing. In other words, not all of its debt is 'core' debt. According to the company: Boeing Capital offers asset-backed lending and leasing, concentrating on assets that are critical to the core operations of Boeing customers. Boeing Capital's primary mission is to support the other Boeing business units by ensuring customers have the financing they need to buy and take delivery of their Boeing products. BCC contributes about $2.4 billion of the firm's overall debt: Source: Boeing second quarter 2015 performance review The company's 'core' debt stands at only about $6.6 billion, so net cash is about $2.6 billion. Boeing Capital accounted for less than 1% of total revenues for FY2014, and only around 1.2% of earnings from operations. Despite its relatively tiny contribution to profits, BCC is also essential to overall operations, however, and the debt it adds to the balance sheet is actually helping to assist sales. Shares of Boeing currently trade at about 18 times FY2015 earnings, but only around 15.5 times 2016's estimated earnings. This seems like a reasonable valuation on earnings for long term investors, especially if the company continues to throw off increasing free cash flow and pay increasing dividends. The last dividend increase was an impressive 25% bump y-o-y. BA Price to Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YCharts Price to free cash flow and price to operating earnings ratios both look reasonable as well on a trailing basis, although not ridiculously "cheap". Boeing is a classic blue-chip company that fits well within the overall context of a diversified portfolio. The company continues to increase free cash flow, earnings, and dividends; and a hefty backlog means revenues should be relatively stable going forward. Impressive return on invested capital and dividend growth add to the case for adding this stalwart to the short list of blue chips currently trading at a fair price in an arguably overextended market.
