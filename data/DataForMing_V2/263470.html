How High Will 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' Fly This Week And What Does It Mean For Disney? - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Disney's tentpole feature, 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' premieres today in Los Angles and will be released nationwide on December 18th to unprecedented hype. Many analysts believe that the film has a chance to break the opening weekend box office record and then threaten the all-time box office champ, Avatar, over the next 2 months. This article discusses the box office prospects and revenue for DIS not only from The Force Awakens, but Disney's entire Star Wars franchise. Superheroes are out, nostalgia is in. After a summer which saw the tentpole Marvel feature Avengers: Age of Ultron disappoint lofty expectations and long-delayed sequel Jurassic World secure the all-time opening weekend record en route to the third highest domestic box office gross of all time, Disney (NYSE: DIS ) prepares to unload the king of nostalgia features this weekend, Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens. The film premiers today in Los Angeles and reviews will begin piling in over the next few days giving crowds and investors an idea of what to expect going forward. With 5 days still remaining before it opens domestically, The Force Awakens has already netted $50 million in ticket pre-sales, good enough for the 50th highest grossing movie of 2015 - without a single person having actually seen the film. Awareness and anticipation for the film is undeniably high. Disney has pulled out all of the stops marketing the film with ubiquitous TV spots, billboards and online banner ads, while at the same time not revealing key plot details as previous Star Wars films have (looking at you, Episodes 1-III trailers) and not even screening the film to avoid the inevitable leakage of spoilers. The power of the Star Wars brand is that it spans generations, while other franchises target a single demographic. The 50-70 year-old crowd will come out for nostalgia for the original trilogy - released in 1977-1982 - especially with the entire original cast reprising their roles. The 20-40 year-old crowd saw the originals in 1999-2005 and will likewise hit the cinemas - probably hoping for something better this time around. Finally, 10-20 year-olds will come for the cute droids - BB-8 will be a merchandising bonanza - and up-and-comers Daisy Ridley and John Boyega. When Disney purchased Lucasfilm for the extravagant price of $4 billion in 2012, many called the company crazy. Now, it is likely that worldwide box office profits for The Force Awakens could pay for more than half of the acquisition on its own. Combined with the Christmas season and innumerable merchandising opportunities, the film provides - not to mention Episodes VIII and IX and two spinoffs - the Star Wars franchise will be a money-making machine for years to come. That "on" button to that machine gets primed today at Los Angeles and then activated on Friday. Everybody knows Star Wars will be huge, but one of the biggest questions being asked by both analysts and cinema lovers is, "Can it beat Avatar as the highest grossing film of all-time?" Figure 1: All-time domestic and worldwide box office grosses showing Avatar at the top spot with $760 million and $2.8 billion, respectively. [Source: Chart is my own, data from Boxofficemojo.com ] To beat Avatar, The Force Awakens would have to gross more than $760 million in the US and $2.8 billion worldwide. This article discusses the box office and overall revenue from the Force Awakens and its sequels and its likely impact on Disney's stock price. Investors will have a good idea of The Force Awakens' trajectory as early as the Monday morning following its release when final opening weekend grosses are announced. Opening weekend grosses give analysts a good idea as to the final gross of a film and typically form the basis of an initial extrapolation. The current domestic record holder for Friday-Sunday gross is Jurassic World, which opened to a stunning $209 million this past June. Analysts are divided about whether Episode VII can top this number with some projecting as high as ~$220 million and others as low as ~$190 million. Breaking the opening weekend record became a bit more challenging this weekend when Disney announced that the film would open in just 3900 theaters, well below the previously announced 4500, and at the lower end of comparable aspiring blockbusters which typically open in over 4000 cinemas. The Hollywood Stock Exchange - where users "invest" paper money on the grosses of movies - is currently low-balling the opening weekend at $197 million, which I feel is reasonable and see a $190 million opening as reasonable. That said, this would be a spectacular weekend given that December is not known for production huge opening grosses. Figure 2 below shows the overall top 10 opening weekends versus the top 10 December releases. Figure 2: All-time domestic opening weekends versus December opening weekends showing that December opening weekends tend to be substantially lower than summertime opening weekends. [Source: Chart is my own, data from Boxofficemojo.com ] The top December opening was 2012's The Hobbit which netted $85 million over three days, which is only good enough for 47th on the overall top opening weekend list. In general, the top 10 December openings are about 1/3rd of the corresponding top overall opening weekends. The reason for this is that most schools remain session (at least for the first half of the month) and holiday shopping and traveling compete with moviegoing. Thus even if The Force Awakens were to open at "only" $190 million, it would still be the top opening December opening weekend by a factor of 2.5, a huge win for Disney. However, the real money for wintertime releases does not come during the first three days as it does for blockbuster summer releases. The two highest grossing films of all time, Avatar and Titanic, both opened during the third week of December. The overall top 10 list shown above in Figure 2 made an average of 2.7x their opening grosses by the end of their runs, while the top 10 December releases performed significantly better for the rest of their runs, grossing 4.8x their opening weekend grosses. The last two weeks of December effectively play as a 14-day weekend with most schools and colleges closed and frequent holidays for the adults. Further, January and February are known as graveyards for new releases and therefore December blockbusters tend to have a period of competition-free screening during their second and third months in theatres. These two factors tend to give December screenings longer "legs" than their summertime counterparts, even if their opening weekend grosses are lower. Let's assume Star Wars opens at the bottom of its range at $190 million. We can use this opening weekend gross and the grosses of comparable films to project final grosses. Figure 3 below shows projections using five different movies as a comparison: Summertime blockbuster Jurassic World, December opening weekend champ The Hobbit, December opener and box office champ Avatar, fellow Star Wars reboot Episode I: The Phantom Menace, and an average of the top 10 December openers. Figure 3: Projections for Star Wars: The Force Awakens based on estimated opening weekend gross and extrapolation using other similar films as models. [Source: Chart and projections are my own, data from Boxofficemojo.com ] If Star Wars plays out like Jurassic World - a typical summer blockbuster - it will be front-loaded and finish with "just" $600 million, good enough for fifth on the all-time list (but the highest grossing in the Star Wars franchise, not adjusted for inflation). Again, given the timing of the release date, I feel that such a pattern is unlikely. If it plays out like the top-grossing December opening weekend of all time - the first Hobbit movie - it will finish with $688 million, good enough for second all time. The Hobbit was a highly anticipated reboot to a dormant franchise - much like Star Wars - but one that was considered a relative disappointment by fans and with its 3.5x multiple relatively front-loaded by December standards as a result. I see $688 million being a reasonable final gross if the overall impression of the Force Awakens is it does not live up to expectations. As such, I see $650-$700 million being the bottom of the range for the Force Awakens. However, if the film is well-liked and becomes the cultural event that it seems destined to be, I could see the film performing closer to the average multiple of the top 10 December opening weekends - 4.8x - which would result in a final gross as high as $915 million, which would if Star Wars plays out like Jurassic World - a typical summer blockbuster - it will be front-loaded and finish with "just" $600 million, good enough for fifth on the all-time list (but the highest grossing in the Star Wars franchise, not adjusted for inflation). Again, given the timing of the release date, I feel that such a pattern is unlikely. If it plays out like the top-grossing December opening weekend of all time - the first Hobbit movie - it will finish with $688 million, good enough for second all time. The Hobbit was a highly anticipated reboot to a dormant franchise - much like Star Wars - but one that was considered a relative disappointment by fans and with its 3.5x multiple was relatively front-loaded by December standards as a result.

However, if the film is well-liked and becomes the cultural event that it seems destined to be, I could see the film performing closer to the average multiple of the top 10 December opening weekends - 4.8x - which would result in a final gross as high as $915 million, which would be #1 all-time domestically, handily beating Avatar's $761 million. Episode I: The Phantom Menace opened in 1999 to a then-record $106 million 5-day gross (after opening on a Wednesday) and, despite being considered something of a disappointment by fans, held well and ultimately grossed $427 million. Should the Force Awakens follow a similar trajectory, it would gross $778 million, just good enough for #1 all-time. While the reboot story it similar, Episode 1 was released in May when, even in the late 1990s, films tended to be more front-loaded and it was, as noted, less well-received than I expect the Force Awakens to be and therefore expect Episode VII to perform a bit better. Moving in the realm of "unlikely, but possible," in 2009, the film Avatar became a cultural phenomenon when it opened during the same week as The Force Awakens. After a solid $77 million opening, it pulled a remarkable 9.7x multiple en route to a record $761 million gross, a record that still stands today. This was driven by word of mouth (which The Force Awakens will lack to the same extent given its pervasive awareness heading into the week) and repeat viewing. Should Star Wars pull a similar multiple, it would finish with an absurd $1.9 billion domestic gross. I believe this is exceptionally unlikely as The Force Awakens is opening to considerably more hype than Avatar and expect it to be much more front-loaded. In conclusion, while I expect the Force Awakens to open several times higher than the previous December opening weekend record, the film should hold comparable to previous December releases and easily become the highest grossing domestic film of all-time with a gross somewhere around $800-$900 million. International grosses, as always, are somewhat more difficult to estimate. After grossing $760 million in the US, Avatar netted an additional $2.02 billion worldwide for a US-to-Foreign multiple of 2.66x. I believe that this will be an appropriate comparison. While Star Wars may not become the same juggernaut that Avatar was across the world, the foreign box office has exploded since 2010 and I believe the two will cancel each other out. Should The Force Awakens hit my $900 million domestic target and see a similar multiple as Avatar, it will wrap with $2.4 billion internationally and a worldwide total of $3.3 billion, also good enough for #1 all-time. The Force Awakens is only the beginning of Disney's plans for the Star Wars franchise. Between now and 2020, the company plans to release an additional four films. Episode VIII will be released in May 2017 and Episode IX will follow in 2019. Disney will also release two standalone films, a first bridging Episodes III and IV entitled Rogue One next year on December 16, 2016 and an untitled Han Solo film is in the works for May 2018. If we assume that Episodes VIII and IX will follow the same decay pattern as Episode II and III, these films will gross $653 million and $801 million domestically and $2.5 and $2.9 billion worldwide, which may ultimately be too aggressive. Spinoffs tend to underperform the films on which they are based, although Minions, the summer 2015 spinoff of the Despicable Me franchise, managed to hold onto 91% of its audience en route to a $336 million domestic tally. I see such a strong hold as unlikely for the Star Wars standalone films - especially Rogue One. I feel a more apt comparison will be the Madagascar franchise and its spinoff Penguins of Madagascar, released in 2014. This film grossed $83 million versus the highest grossing film in the franchise (Madagascar 3) which pulled in $216 million in 2012 for a retention rate of just 38%. If we use this as a benchmark, Rogue One and the untitled Han Solo film will each net about $345 million domestically and $1.2 billion worldwide. If we assume that the budget for each film is around $200 million (budgets have not been formally announced yet) and that Disney spends another $150 million marketing and distributing each of the films, the company can expect to net in excess of $800 million in profit for each film with The Force Awakens alone earning over $2 billion for the company, depending on how much of its international box office receipts the studio holds onto. DVD, Blue-Ray, and electronic sales should also be a major earner for Disney. Home grosses as a function of box office receipts vary. The top 5 selling home entertainment selling films of all-time in the US - Frozen, Avatar, Despicable Me 2, The Avengers, and The Dark Knight Rises - saw average grosses equal to 25% of their domestic theatrical grosses. Should the Star Wars sequels and spinoffs see similar sales, this will be a gross of an additional $760 million for the franchise. Subtracting for product costs, Disney should earn well over $600 million in profit. I am not going to try to estimate worldwide home entertainment sales due to extreme variability and inconsistent statistics. As noted in the introduction to this article, the Star Wars franchise extends beyond the films and Disney is likely to see significant revenue from merchandising of its franchise. A recent article by The Hollywood Reporter estimated that merchandise sales attributed to Star Wars could tally $5 billion in its first year alone. This is based on the precedent set by the popular Pixar film Cars (also a Disney product) that saw sales of $2.8 billion in its first year. The article estimates that based on licensing agreements, Disney should see at least 10% of these sales as direct profit. If we assume a 10% year-over-year decline thereafter - reasonable given that the company will be pumping out a new film per year. At this rate, total sales would exceed $17 billion over the next four years, of which Disney would likely earn at least $1.7 billion. Figure 4 below summarizes the estimated revenue and profit that I discussed above for each of the 5 upcoming Star Wars films, home entertainment sales, and merchandising. Figure 4: Summary of revenue from Star Wars box office grosses, home sales, and merchandise over the next four years. [Source: Chart and projections are my own, data used to generate projections from Boxofficemojo.com ] In the next four years alone, Disney can expect to gross around $29 billion related to the Star Wars franchise, of which $11.7 billion will be profit. Of course, profits will extend well beyond four years and I expect Disney to continue releasing films going forward. Given Disney's market cap of $179 billion, these profits are equal to 6% of the company's value in its first four years alone. Not bad for a company it purchased for "just" $4 billion. Over the last six months, has been effectively flat, falling 1.75%. The company saw steep losses during the August market swoon, briefly dipping under $100/share. During the subsequent recovery, DIS recovered most of its losses but failed to reach a new all-time high. Over the past two weeks, DIS has again been under pressure, falling from $120 to Friday's closing price of $108.09. Figure 5 below plots DIS over the past 6 months. Figure 5: Disney over the last 6 months showing chopping price action with a 10% dip over the past month. [Source: Chart is my own, data from Yahoo Finance] Overall, has been a significant market outperformer over the past 5 years, gaining 195% versus just 62% for the S&P 500. During this time, I have been in and out of the stock, participating in perhaps 60% of that 195%. Since June, I have been out of the stock due to concerns over its lagging ESPN business. ESPN represents 75% of the company's cable revenues, a business segment that is Disney's largest, contributing about 44% of the company's revenue. Since 2013, the number of ESPN subscribers has declined from 99 million to 92 million, which has resulted in an estimated $560 million in lost affiliate fees. While ESPN may continue to weigh on the cable segment over the next few years, I expect that the studio's film segment, highlighted by its Star Wars franchise will more than make up for any losses in this area. I continue to view Disney as an excellent long-term hold whose value will only be enhanced by the upcoming Force Awakens release. For that reason, I re-purchased DIS on last week's late week slump under $110 and plan to hold for the foreseeable future.
