WSJ: Bids for Yahoo core more likely lower, at $2B-$3B - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha May 19 2016, 23:14 ET | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor With just a couple of weeks before the next round of bids is due for the core assets of Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ), offers are expected in the range of $2B-$3B , The Wall Street Journal reports -- lower than a $4B-$8B range that had become conventional wisdom over the past couple of months. Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) is still considered a front-runner, and it and private-equity rivals are expected to start in the low end of that range, sources told the WSJ. Still unclear, though, is exactly which assets those bids would cover. Bids might vary considerably from each other in structure. Access to a Yahoo "data room" by bidders -- and the more detailed look at Yahoo's struggles that provides -- may be dampening hopes that Yahoo had for higher bids (at one point, for $10B for the core Internet business). That $2 billion figure is to tame expectations, it will be around $3.5 billion and that in turn will give the stock an additional boost, it's purely a gimmick to tamper expectations and than surprise investors with a higher figure Yahoo just isn't worth that much.  A company in decline that may end up being a liability from a layoff standpoint doesn't make much sense to me. What is the REAL value of something if no one is willing to pay for it?  That's the question.  If the sum of the parts isn't worth the whole to any potential suitor, then it certainly might be a fair offer.  And if Verizon is the ONLY suitor, then it's worth what Verizon thinks it's worth. Yahoo still has some interesting assets, like their fantasy sports franchise among other things, but when viewed as a "whole" this company has been circling the drain for years now and it just may not be worth the trouble to many acquirers anymore (Blackberry is another example). I am not sure what other shareholders would think.  I tend to see $2b as so close to zero it would hardly be worth it to sell.  Might be better to do a Reverse Morris Trust with Time Inc instead.  Then cut head count and turn it into a cash cow.  Then let the market decide what the RMT would be worth. Maybe WSJ talking it down ,so they can buy at a discount,flush out any retail investors left ,they're not gonna get the result they anticipate ,staying long,worth $44 Getting a little tired hearing this same old broken record.  Marissa this and Marissa that.  All I want to know at this point is how much is VZ going to pay me. you will get nothing. the sell will benefit yahoo coffers and will be used to pay marissa. Did you really think the money yahoo makes from selling off their assets will be broken pro rata and given to all yahoo shareholders? This is very common.  CEO's get paid exorbitantly and it doesn't matter if they do a good job or not.  Welcome to America. Aol went for 4.4 billion and Yhoo going for a couple billion?  Lol, I call BS.  Just a plant story IMO.  Heck, they can sell tumbler alone for close to 1 billion.  They have a ton of real estate as well.  Of course it could be that the core means Yhoo assets that excludes real estate and such.  Hence, the lower offer.  May also exclude things like tumbler.  Nobody knows. am I the only loser/bag holder who believe the blue dress bch purposefully and intentionally blew up the presentation again so she can stay? The best bet re: YHOO guaranteed to make money is that someone never fails to bring up the "blue dress."
