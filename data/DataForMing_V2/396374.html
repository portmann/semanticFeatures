Ford: Company Proposes But Analyst Disposes. - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Stellar earnings report should mean something but it didn't. Market is forward looking alright but should the present mean nothing at all? Ford's (NYSE: F ) first quarter results were nothing but stellar. EPS beat by 22 cents, revenue beat by 2 billion, and the pretax profit was its best in more than a 100 years. The stock went up after the earnings but not quite enough to catch up with the undervaluation. To add insult to injury, analysts downgraded the stock and sent it down nearly 4% on Friday. As a result, the stock is 17% away its mean price target of $15.87. is trading at a trailing multiple of 6, mainly due to worries that the rampaging sales will not continue. But things aren't slowing as badly as expected: North America had its best ever quarter in terms of pre-tax profit. Europe, long the company's Achilles heel, just had its best quarter since 2008. South American unit shows losses, mainly due to economic factors. But the company is taking all the steps it could by reducing costs as well. Middle East and Asia Pacific regions are on track to at least match the stellar returns of 2015. Overall, the company reported its best ever first quarter free cash flow of $2.7 billion. With almost 4 billion outstanding shares, the company needs about $600 million in free cash flow to cover its dividends. The recent free cash flow number is almost five times this requirement. Obviously, not all the quarters will be this strong but the dividends are not only well-covered but there is enough room for more special dividends. While oil recently surged, things aren't too rosy for oil companies in the near to medium term. Expect lower gas price to continue and this will encourage more people to buy/drive more cars. Add to it the fact that borrowing interest rates are still very low. Lastly, if an upgrade from an analyst was enough to knock the stock down by 4%, consider the fact that four other firms have price targets between $14 and $20. That's between 3% and 50% higher than the current price. Beyond all these points, even if you believe things are going to take a downturn for Ford, take a look at the table below. The table below assumes the dividend stays the same for three years. While the dividends could be cut theoretically, the free cash flow strength and the company's recent measured approach (not increasing quarterly dividend but announcing special dividends based on profit) make it unlikely. The table also ignores any special dividends to compensate the risk of dividends being cut. An investor who reinvests when the stock is at it lows will accumulate 12.36 shares at the end of year 3 for every 100 shares owned. As a result, reinvesting at lows increases the dividend income by almost 20%. Obviously, no one can time the highs and lows perfectly, but reinvesting the dividends when the stock generally appears undervalued is a good ploy for long-term investors. Conclusion: Potential sales decline, currency fluctuations, and worries about the credit business are all valid reasons for the market to remain cautious about Ford but at what cost? We believe the shares remain attractive and are still having the stock on our watchlist. What do you think is the main reason the stock remains unappreciated? Please leave your comments below.
