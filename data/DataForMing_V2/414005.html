Netflix Faces A New, Deadly Headwind - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha The 20% quota and imposed financial contributions on Netflix certainly present a significant threat to its overseas growth. This regulation hurts Netflix in at least two ways: directly and via the subscriber base proxy. A recent article in the Financial Times reports Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) facing a 20% local content quota in Europe. While this mandate has not yet been passed, it certainly presents a significant threat to NFLX's overseas growth. But let's start with a side-note about Amazon, so that I can clarify my reason for writing about NFLX's future while ignoring that of Amazon's. Amazon's main profits come from the cloud and from e-commerce at the moment, making Amazon Prime threats not nearly as serious as those targeting Netflix. Netflix is a subscriber-based business model, whereas Amazon is more of a transaction-based business model (and a B2B business model for its cloud services). Thus, I will focus on the threat to NFLX, not AMZN. That said, much of the following also applies to AMZN's Prime business. Is the proposed mandate a form of socialism - taking from successful corporations and giving to less successful. One clause of the mandate says "yes": EU nations will have the ability to impose financial contributions - "impose" and "contributions" form an oxymoron, by the way - on Netflix to fund national works. This certainly betrays the entire idea of on-demand media, which brings consumers the ability to freely decide on what they watch. Gone are the days when everyone watches the same handful of channels (this still goes on in Japan). Netflix's major appeal - at least at the beginning - was its destruction of national boundaries when it came to media. Now, nations plan to "impose" upon Netflix to reinstate those boundaries, at least to a 20% extent. This regulation hurts Netflix in at least two ways. First, the imposed financial contributions will directly affect the company's bottom line. This comes at a time when the valuation of the company is falling. EBITDA/EV can be thought of the company's earnings performance versus its stock price. It has been shown to be perhaps the strongest predictor of future stock price , and NFLX is performing quite poorly in this parameter, thanks to a toppling EBITDA: Now is not the time NFLX wants to see any financial impositions. The company's growth has slowed and any headwinds simply give investors all the more reason to drop the stock until the situation improves. In addition, the proposal will restrict the advertisements allowed on NFLX, specifically targeting food and alcohol ads. Second, the possibility of subscriber loss appears along with this proposal. For example, one option NFLX has to meet the 20% quota is to cut down on international programs (as opposed to adding more domestic programs). The loss of certain programs could drive away subscribers, exacerbating the damage of the original financial attacks. What Can Netflix Do about the "Financial Contributions?" The future is not set in stone. Netflix has several options. First, Netflix can simply give in, take the financial hit and hope to corner the market in Europe. Other on-demand media companies, such as Amazon, will also be affected by the regulations and might simply decide to stay out. This seems to be less of an option for Netflix, which is much more of a one-trick pony than Amazon. This would hurt Netflix initially, but as a relatively young company, it likely has the pivoting power to find a way to evolve and survive among the tight regulations. If NFLX wants to be optimistic about the situation, it can see itself as a cable company, which traditionally must pay taxes. But then again, cable companies are what consumers are attempting to avoid with Netflixâ€¦ Second, Netflix can opt out. With the EU looking for a piece of almost every sort of revenue stream, it might be wise of Netflix to avoid the trouble and remain a foreigner. The company could simply set its own rules to work with only nations that are tax-friendly. Already having an international foothold, Netflix pulling out of a country would certainly upset consumers. But to where do the consumers direct their anger: Netflix or the local government? This solution will also hurt NFLX's bottom line but could help it in other areas that matter, such as legal and operation fees. Third, NFLX can offset the financial hit by charging more. If the company really does corner the market by accepting these rules, it can switch to an Amazon Prime model, in which subscribers pay per episode. This would drive away subscribers, but at what rate when other options are not available? When Amazon begins making its monthly subscriber fees in three video streams instead of dozens, profit/data cost skyrockets. Again, the subscriber loss could kill this solution, especially as consumers become smarter about seeking out free content online. Torrenting and streaming sites provide everything Netflix does for free (legality aside), and some subscribers simply won't be able or willing to handle the Amazon Prime price model. What Can Netflix Do about the 20% Quota? The first option is to play it how the EU wants it: Add a bunch of EU programs to your lineup - at a hefty cost. NFLX can take the hit and become an on-demand NPR. Subscribers should not mind as long as none of the international programs are cut. The second option is to go into it half-assed: Sign a bunch of EU indie programs that won't be popular while cutting down on international content to reach that magical 20%. Subscribers will likely leave in this case, making it a cost/benefit trade-off. But a possible side-benefit here could be to get the consumers on NFLX's side, much like the dreaded "This video is not available in your area due to your country's regulations" message on many EU versions of YouTube. Obstinate viewers circumvent these nanny laws by using VPNs. Perhaps Netflix can even assist in helping its subscribers learn and use VPNs - maybe offering a free VPN as part of the subscription. This would be a clear attempt to elude the EU's regulations, but what could the EU do? NFLX is simply providing another service to its subscribers. The logical solution here is to let consumers decide what they want and to let companies decide what they offer. Of course, governments - especially those in the EU - are not exactly logical. In this light, the restrictions placed on NFLX are truly concerning. NFLX is unlikely to find an easy solution to this one. With much of its growth and P/E being bolstered by international subscriber growth expectations, the EU deal can easily become a significant headwind to NFLX. The easiest way to envision this is to be a Netflix subscriber in the US. If the government suddenly taxes Netflix, at least a part of that tax will be passed onto you. Your cost has suddenly increased but with no corresponding benefit; would you drop the service? This is what NFLX faces in Europe. And if NFLX gives in, other countries will see the potential to do the same. We are seeing this already in New Zealand. My Exploiting Earnings premium subscription is now live, here on Seeking Alpha.
