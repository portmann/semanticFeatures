Apple: The Silver Lining In The Cirrus Cloud - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. Revised guidance from Cirrus Logic and Qorvo appears to confirm declining iPhone production. In fact, a deeper examination of the data tends towards the opposite conclusion. On the surface, the revenue guidance issued by Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) suppliers Cirrus Logic (NASDAQ: CRUS ) and Qorvo (NASDAQ: QRVO ) was devastating. Cirrus revised its prior guidance for December quarter revenue down by 10%, while Qorvo revised downward by about 15%. This seemed to confirm the string of recent reports of iPhone production cutbacks and consequent impact on suppliers. But, in fact, the Cirrus and Qorvo guidance does nothing of the sort. I was very interested in the Cirrus and Qorvo announcements since it represents the first really hard data from suppliers rather than the usual supply chain rumors. Far from being a tale of Apple iPhone woe, the subsequent reporting of the announcements is illustrative of how selective the negative narrative about Apple has become. Let's take a look at Cirrus first, since it appears to be the most closely tied to the fortunes of Apple. Estimates of how dependent Cirrus is on Apple seem to be all over the map. SA's own Eric Jhonsa describes Cirrus as getting "well over half" of its revenue from Apple. A recent Forbes article on the announcements estimates that Cirrus gets "almost 70%" of its revenue from Apple. Finally, the Reuters report on the announcements estimates that Cirrus gets "about three-quarters of its revenue from Apple." The first important takeaway is that based on the revenue percentages, it's clear that Cirrus's revision might not be due to Apple at all. But let's suppose it is. The Cirrus announcement states that it will have revenue of about $347 million in the December quarter. Oh, woe is Cirrus! That's only a 16% y/y increase compared to the December 2014 revenue of $298.6 million. That's right. Cirrus is projecting that their revenue will still grow by 16% y/y compared to the quarter in which Apple achieved all time highs in revenue and iPhone sales. That's considerably greater than Apple's guidance for the December quarter of 1-4% revenue growth. Cirrus is a second (or maybe third) tier supplier to Apple, which means it gets its orders not from Apple directly, but from another Apple supplier such as Foxconn, or maybe from an intermediate supplier such as Jabil Circuits. As a consequence, there's some uncertainty in my mind regarding the phasing of Cirrus orders compared to overall iPhone production. Probably, orders to Cirrus come in at least thirty days ahead of the time that the Cirrus chips are incorporated into iPhone production. This is somewhat canceled by the usual 30-day billing cycle, so I'm assuming that Cirrus revenue is roughly in sync with iPhone sales revenue. Even if it leads by a whole quarter, Cirrus's results for the September quarter were also exceptional, with a 46% y/y increase. I think the Cirrus guidance should be taken as a bullish sign for Apple's December quarter, and would be were it not for the relentlessly negative media coverage that Apple has endured these past months. The Cirrus revenue guidance is among the most reliable data we've had from an Apple supplier in 2016, and the fact that it's a positive indicator for iPhone sales growth in the December quarter is being completely ignored. Let's move on to Qorvo. Here, the waters are a little more muddied. Qorvo, the reader may recall, is the result of the merger of RF Micro Devices and TriQuint Semiconductor. Both predecessor companies have RF devices on the latest iPhone 6s . I'm not able to find any estimate of how dependent Qorvo is on Apple. Qorvo makes a wide range of electronic devices , most of which are not present in the iPhone. Qorvo lists numerous applications for its devices including cable TV, defense and aerospace, optical networks, radar, and satellites, besides mobile devices. Qorvo's announcement does specify that its guidance revision is due to "weaker than forecasted demand in the Company's Mobile Products segment." It's probably reasonable to assume that Apple is Qorvo's principal customer in that segment. Qorvo's revised guidance of $620 million in revenue for the December quarter does represent a decline from the previous year for the combined company of 16.5%. However, Qorvo's September quarter revenue was quite strong at $708.3 million, so it may be that Apple's suppliers simply bought Qorvo chips in advance of the December quarter. Or it may be that Qorvo was expecting design wins on other non-Apple mobile platforms that simply didn't come through. I certainly don't think that Qorvo's revenue decline argues for a similar decline in iPhone sales in the December quarter. Qorvo's guidance for the March quarter was, however, somewhat encouraging, with a projection of approximately flat sequential revenue growth. This represents only a slight decline of 2.4% y/y. Given all the supply chain reports of steep cutbacks for the March quarter, I find this projection encouraging, but obviously, a little ambiguous where Apple is concerned. Overall, I see Cirrus as the more important barometer for Apple. Cirrus revenue is more directly tied to Apple. The fact that Cirrus projected a y/y revenue gain in the December quarter of 16%, coming on the heels of an impressive 46% y/y increase in the September quarter argues strongly in favor of continued iPhone sales growth momentum in the December quarter. Qorvo is more difficult to interpret. In Qorvo's September quarter press release , Qorvo states that it "Secured content expansion opportunities on marquee smartphones launching in calendar 2016 and 2017." This seems to imply that Qorvo expects its chips will be on more than just the iPhone, so the relationship between Qorvo's Mobile segment and iPhone sales is more difficult to deduce. Given that the worst-case scenario for iPhone sales in the December quarter is zero growth, it's hard to see how Qorvo's 16% y/y decline correlates with iPhone sales. Once again, there is the problem of phasing Qorvo's business with iPhone sales, and it may be that Qorvo's revenue peaked in the September quarter as iPhone suppliers prepared for the December quarter. If that's the case, the sequential decline of 12.5% between the September and December quarters is in line with the usual seasonal decline that Apple typically has from the December to March quarters, and is really nothing to worry about. I wish I could be more definitive about Qorvo right now, but I just don't think there's enough data to draw hard conclusions from Qorvo. Like many Apple investors, when I first saw the reports about Cirrus and Qorvo, I became a little concerned. This was, after all, real supplier data, rather than rumors and speculation. Clearly, the Cirrus and Qorvo data represent a mixed bag, but I tend to weight the Cirrus data more heavily. As such, I'm encouraged that Apple is going to pull off a strong December quarter, and continue to maintain my buy rating. As we get closer to Apple's earnings report on January 26, the focus of the negative narrative has shifted increasingly to the March quarter and beyond. I believe that this is because iPhone sales exceeding expectations and last year's sales record for the December quarter is almost a given. I believe investors should withhold judgment on the March quarter until Apple provides its guidance, rather than act on the basis of supply chain rumors. Tagged: Investing Ideas , Technology
