A Fundamental Look At Disney And Its Competitors, And Why Disney Is A Buy - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Sep.  4, 2015  1:22 PM ET  |  About: The Walt Disney Company (DIS) , Includes: CBS , CMCSA , FOXA , LGF , TWX , VIAB by: Suyog Dahal Markets are down over 20%, presenting a great opportunity to add to your portfolio. Fundamentally, Disney still in line with industry averages but is set to grow earnings quicker. Disney has one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry and a strong portfolio of content as catalysts for perspective investors. Disney (NYSE: DIS ) stock has been on a tear over the last 5 years, gaining over 200% before the recent selloff. Investors have loved CEO Bob Iger and Disney's acquisition of quality brands including Marvel and Lucasfilm. Disney's latest mixed earnings release combined with the recent market sell off presents a great opportunity for prospective investors to buy shares, or for current shareholders to build on their positions. I have been looking to add a media entertainment company to my portfolio so I decided to fundamentally analyze 7 of the major media entertainment companies. The companies I researched were: The Walt Disney Company , Viacom (NASDAQ: VIAB ), Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCSA ), CBS Corporation (NYSE: CBS ), 21st Century Fox (NASDAQ: FOXA ), TimeWarner (NYSE: TWX ), and Lionsgate (NYSE: LGF ). I compiled the annual and quarterly results of each company, as well as analysts projections for future Revenues and EPS from Yahoo Finance . Using this data, I determined the Enterprise Value ("EV") of each company, and calculated EV/Revenues, EV/EBITDA (the Enterprise Multiple), EV/EBIT, P/E, and PEG multiples. Here are my results. (Note that I used the total shares disclosed on the latest SEC filings for each companies' share count. Figures on Google Finance or Yahoo Finance may differ, and may not accurately reflect the total diluted share count. Prices used reflect prices at market close on September 3, 2015.) From the chart above, you'll see that Disney trades at the highest Price/Earnings ratio compared to the other media conglomerates. Lionsgate, a studio focused business, is the only company of these 7 that trades at a higher P/E ratio. Disney's PEG ratio is also slightly higher than its competitors at 1.3, using the sector growth rate of 15%, indicating that Disney's P/E is growing quicker than the company itself. EV/Revenues (EV/R), EV/EBITDA, and EV/EBIT are multiples that are used to assess the financial health of public companies, usually as potential acquisition targets, or to compare potential investments. EV/R, similar to the Price/Sales multiple, is normally dismissed because it is not profit related, but it is a reliable comparison tool. The median EV/R across the entire US market is 1.58 x, but varies widely by industry. Top decile of firms have EV/Revenues that exceed 15x, with the bottom decile have ratios under .5x. Generally, companies with a lower EV/R are seen as more valuable because their revenue stream can be acquired for less money. The median EV/R multiple among these media companies is 3.42x with an average of 3.25x. Disney's multiple of 4.26x puts it slightly above the rest of this group. EV/EBITDA, better known as the Enterprise multiple, and EV/EBIT is where Disney looks more attractive. The Enterprise multiple looks at a company through the eyes of potential acquirers, including company debt. Not at all likely for these firms, but a good analytical tool. The average Enterprise Multiple among these companies is 15.55x. High growth companies tend to have higher enterprise multiples that slower growth companies, as evident with Lionsgate's multiple of 35.17x, and Comcast's multiple of 10.41x. Disney has an Enterprise Multiple of 14.95x, higher than Comcast, Viacom, CBS, Fox, and Time Warner, showing Disney to be a higher growth company than it's competitors. EV/EBITDA is useful as a growth and cash flow type comparison as it ignores the non-cash expenses of depreciation and amortization, which can differ as not all conglomerates are built the same. However, as an investor EV/EBIT may be more useful. Some investors actually prefer EV/EBIT to P/E because it includes important balance sheet information like net debt, and compares firms profits while ignoring tax differences. Disney's EV/EBIT multiple is 17.86x, in line with the industry average of 17.42x. But Disney is growing revenues and earnings more quickly than the rest of the industry, as can be seen in Disney's forecasted years and it's EV/EBITDA multiple, making Disney a more attractive investment than it's competitors. Fundamentally, Disney is in line with industry averages using these multiples. In addition, Analysts have forecasted Disney's revenues and earnings to grow at a greater rate than the rest of the industry, which makes Disney an attractive investment. This anticipated growth is likely why Disney trades at a slight premium over its competitors in terms of P/E. However, Disney also has numerous catalysts in its favor throughout the next few years including at least five Star Wars films, nine Marvel films, and four Pixar films that have already been announced. It also has planned expansions to its Walt Disney World parks in Orlando,FL and its parks in Asia. This combined with steadily increasing park ticket prices and park attendance makes Disney a valuable stock to buy at current prices.
