Those plans include increasing the data cap on all of their wireless plans… but at a cost. CNet reports that Verizon’s “ice cream” plans are getting more generous — and more expensive. CNet also reports that existing customers can opt into the new pricing scheme if they wish, but will not be required to do so. It’s part of the same big fancy unveiling that’s still rumored to be bringing rollover data to Verizon customers. Obviously that didn’t happen on July 1, but sources tell CNet it’s coming. Verizon declined to comment on any of the rumors when CNet asked, but hinted that there will be “fireworks” from the company later this week, and that everyone should “stay tuned.” Rumor: Verizon To Announce Rollover Data, “Unlimited” No-Overage Option on July 1 The Consumerist Guide To Understanding Your Verizon Wireless Bill Verizon Gets Rid Of Contracts, Cheap Phones (For New Customers Only, Of Course) Previous Apple Adds Organ Donor Registration To Health App Consumerist is currently testing a new user experience.
