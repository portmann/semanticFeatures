Is Verizon A Good Dividend Income Investment For The Good Business Portfolio? - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha Verizon's yearly dividend is 4.54% and it has increased its dividend for at least 10 years in a row. However, total return underperforms the DOW average over a 29-month test period. A good business company but in a very competitive industry. This article reviews the ten Good Business Portfolio Guidelines to Verizon's (NYSE: VZ ) parameters and evaluates its business prospects. Verizon is a large cap wireless and broadband service provider. Other comparisons of total return, dividend income, business growth potential and earnings will also be compared. Verizon passes all ten Good Business Portfolio Guidelines. These guidelines are only used to filter companies to be considered in the portfolio. There are many good business companies that don't break many of these guidelines but will still not be considered for the portfolio at this time. For a complete set of the guidelines, please see my article on Omega Healthcare . These guidelines provide me with a balanced portfolio of income, defensive and growing companies that keeps me ahead of the DOW average. Verizon is a large cap company with a $202 billion capitalization which is about equal to major competitor AT&T (NYSE: T ) which has a market cap of $175 billion. I like large cap companies because they have staying power and the assets and borrowing power to weather the storm if it comes. Verizon has a dividend of 4.54% and it has increased it for at least 10 years in a row. This high dividend and the yearly increases make Verizon a candidate for the dividend income investor. It's expected that Verizon will increase its dividend in the first week of September by $0.02 which has been the case for the last few years. Verizon's cash flow is strongly positive at $6.57/share, allowing it to expand its fiber optic net in order to increase customer accounts and services. The company is in the business of providing television, Internet and phone services as a package while other companies are concentrating on smart phones. In the short term, I think Verizon has the right competitive approach. The cash flow is high enough for Verizon to pay a high dividend and grow the business plus pay down some debt. I also want the CAGR going forward to be able to cover my yearly expenses. My dividends provide 2.8% of the portfolio as income and I need 2.2% more for a yearly distribution of 5%. Verizon has a 3-year CAGR of 7% easily meeting that requirement. The Good Business Portfolio Guidelines are just a screen to start with and not absolute rules. When I look at a company, the total return is a key parameter to see if it fits the objective of the Good Business portfolio. Verizon underperformed in my 29.0-month test baseline compared to the DOW average. I chose the 29.0-month test period (starting January 1, 2013) because it includes the great year of 2013, the moderate year of 2014 and 2015 YTD. I have had comments about why I do not compare the total return to the S&P 500 average. I use the DOW average because the Good Business Portfolio has six DOW companies in it and is weighted more to the DOW average than the S&P 500. Modeling the DOW average is not an objective of the portfolio but just happened by using the ten guidelines as a filter for company selection. Verizon has above average dividends, making it appropriate for the dividend income investor. The dividend is well covered and has been increased each year for at least ten years. For the last quarter, Verizon reported earnings of $1.02/share compared to expected earnings of $0.95/share and last year's earnings of $1.15/share. Revenues missed expectations by $290 million. Verizon increased new connections by 565K. More important than the $0.07 beat is that Verizon is gaining new subscribers as it invests in further expanding its fiber optic network. AT&T in comparison seems to be concentrating more on the telephone sector of the business. The objective of the Good Business Portfolio is to have all types of investments - growth, income, defensive and aggressive companies - creating a balance in the portfolio. Over time, I believe this approach gives staying power to the portfolio. The only negative is that this method precludes some types of investments like utilities because of their underperformance of total return. For electric/gas utilities, regulation provides protection on price but this also limits their profits since competition is reduced. The telephone communications business is regulated in a different way from electric/gas utilities. Verizon is regulated by regulating the radio frequency spectrum that a carrier can use. Right now there is a price war among telecommunication companies using the Internet, Wi-Fi and other modes of communications. Large companies like VZ are competing against themselves and other companies. Will land line phones go away eventually? Most likely. But who knows when, it could take 10, 20, even 50 years. How will you communicate with your friends and businesses in the future. I think in the future all personal communications will be done through our smart device via a super Wi-Fi worldwide network system, a yet to be invented system adding bandwidth possibly via satellites. For now, VZ plans to use fiber optics to increase the number of its customers and has increased its business with 565K new connections in the latest quarter. In the long run (20 years from now), AT&T may have the better approach. Verizon is a good business in the regulated telephone-broadband business and competes against other companies like AT&T, Sprint (NYSE: S ) and T-Mobile (NYSE: TMUS ). There is a price war going on right now and I don't know who will win. Verizon is appropriate for dividend income investors with its high stable growing income but at the price of an underperforming total return over my 29-month test period. Verizon is not acceptable for the Good Business Portfolio right now because of the small underperformance in total return, but it will be kept on the watch list for future consideration. I also don't allow the portfolio to have more than 25 companies; it's at 24 now and the spinoff of Hewlett-Packard's (NYSE: HPQ ) PC business in November will make it 25. Of course, this is not a recommendation to buy or sell, and you should always do your own research and talk to your financial advisor before any purchase or sale.
