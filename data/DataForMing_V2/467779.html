Border Patrol Agents Detain 2 â€˜Pokemon Goâ€™ Players (UPI) Border Patrol agents detained two teenagers from Canada on Thursday after they illegally crossed the border into the U.S. while playing the game. The duo, who have not been identified, were so busy playing the smartphone app that they didnâ€™t realize theyâ€™d walked into another country, the Toronto Sun reports. Agents apprehended the pair as they walked southbound near the Montana community of Sweets Grass, which borders the Alberta province town of Coutts. After discovering the teens were â€œunaware of their surroundingsâ€? and did not pose a threat, authorities transported them to the nearby Border Patrol Station. â€œBoth juveniles were so captivated by their â€˜Pokemon GOâ€™ games that they lost track of where they were,â€? the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agencyâ€™s public affairs officer Michael Rappold said via a statement.

This activity – dominated by Japanese group SoftBank’s (9984.T) $32 billion swoop for chip designer ARM Holdings (ARM.L) – has defied warnings that dealmaking could dry up for a period if Britain backed Brexit, given uncertainty surrounding risks to the economy and access to the EU single market.
