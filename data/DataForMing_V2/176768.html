Between Netflix, Hulu, SlingTV, Amazon Prime and other similar companies, cord-cutting consumers (or those considering cutting the cord) have several options for streaming video. The latest entrant into the over-the-top [OTT] ring comesÂ from the other side of the pond: the BBC. Reuters reports that BBCâ€™s Director General Tony Hall broke the news at an industry event in Cambridge today. â€œWeâ€™re launching a new OTT video service in America offering BBC fans programs they wouldnâ€™t otherwise get,” said Hall, “showcasing British actors, our program-makers and celebrating our culture.â€? While Hall didn’t elaborate on just what shows U.S. viewers would get, the company already allows some content – such as Doctor Who and Top Gear – to be shown in the states via BBC America, a partnership with AMC Networks. Additionally, many BBC shows are available on other OTT services like Hulu and Netflix. Hall was also mum on a timeline for the project or what it would be called. The streaming service announcement comes as the company searches for ways to boost revenues and catch up with other companies that already using multi-platforms, Reuters reports. “While every major global player is creating a more integrated system, it would make no sense for us to go the other way and break up a system that is delivering returns that are essential to support public service programs,” Hall said.
