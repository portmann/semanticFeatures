ETF Hub Nov 27 2015, 12:36 ET | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor J.P. Morgan sees a strong end to the year for automakers Ford (NYSE: F ) and General Motors (NYSE: GM ), with a particularly strong November in the U.S. ahead as well as China sales beating expectations. The firm's Ryan Brinkman sees U.S. light vehicle SAAR heading up to 18.5M in November from October's 18.1M (which itself was up 10% Y/Y) -- meaning that not only would November purchases beat all other November figures, they would be the most of any other month in the current cycle. While incentives are down Q/Q, they're up about $100 Y/Y but resulting in average transaction prices up more than $1,000 from a year ago. “Some automakers we spoke to were surprised at the rate of improvement in recent months, pointing to unexpectedly strong consumer reaction to only modestly higher incentives, which has lowered inventories (a recipe for strong profitability),” Brinkman wrote. Any thoughts on the potential for downside surprises due to excessive car loan defaults...due to the high percentage of loans made to consumers with terrible FICO scores (apparently GM is running over 80% of loans to those with very low scores for example)? Ford does not do subprime loans.  That does not mean they don't sell to these folks, instead they have to get financing via credit unions. Defaults on subprime car loans is very low.people will pay their car loans before most anything else because they need it to get to work. One article that was out in May said that subprime car loans were the lowest since 2012, may have changed since then. Where do you get the 80% I couldn't find that anywhere. November sales results should be a valuable indication of  where  F stock will be heading. F 150 inventory levels are good , cannot use that as an excuse for weak sales.  Europe sales should be exceptional  in Nov. oweing to VW's problems. F is a major part of my holdings, everything is in place for a major upward move of the stock, let's hope so!
