Time Warner CFO: Pay-TV sub losses not that fast; no superhero fatigue - Time Warner Inc. (NYSE:TWX) | Seeking Alpha To screen ETFs by asset class, performance, yield and more, check out the ETF Hub. ETF Hub Aug 13 2015, 19:42 ET | About: Time Warner Inc. (TWX) | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Despite a big over-the-top move with HBO this year, Time Warner ( TWX -1.1%) is "focusing on enhancing and strengthening the [pay TV] ecosystem," CFO Howard Averill said today. Speaking at Nomura's Media & Telecom conference, Averill split the difference between building up the established system and to "really make sure and reach those consumers outside the ecosystem." TV subscriber losses ( blamed for a selloff in media issues last week) may be moving a bit faster than anticipated, Averill said, but "nothing significantly different over the last several quarters." And after Marvel skipped Comic-Con this year -- largely leaving it to Time Warner and its slate of DC Comics-based media -- Averill praised the company's film business and said attractive growth would be the 2016 story, not "superhero fatigue": "We just don't see any evidence of that," he said, pointing to different tones struck by Warner's hero stories. HBO Now won't be profitable this year, but will be after launch costs are cleared and subscribers ramp up, he said, and that likely includes an international expansion. More and more people are shedding both cable and satellite in favor of over the air channels. Having done the same myself. It does not make to much sense to pay to watch television commercials when you can watch them for free. Save for a NetFlix subscription, many people are leaving subscription cable and satellite television services. I guess you have never watched HBO because they don't have commercials, and they have a similar stand alone service, HBO Now, to Netflix, with comparable original programming, first-run movies, and sports, which Netflix doesn't have.
