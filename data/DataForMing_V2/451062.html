Verizon revamping plans, raising prices and data buckets - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha Jul  5 2016, 15:44 ET | About: Verizon Communications (VZ) | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Verizon's ( VZ +0.8%) setting an overhaul to its plans , including a speculated price hike, but one that will come with more data. Last year the company resized its data plans using a clothing-size metaphor, from small to double-extra large. Now, it's looking to raise the price on its "S" plan to $35/month from $30, but double its size to 2 GB. Similarly, the "M" plan will go to $50 from $45, but increase to 4 GB from 3 GB; "L" up to $70 from $60, with data increasing to 8 GB from 6 GB; "XL" to $90 from $80, with data going to 16 GB from 12 GB; and "XXL" to $110/month from $100, but with 24GB, up from 18 GB. Verizon will also add a rollover data program and improve access to Canada and Mexico (following in competitive footsteps there, as carriers work to provide better North American access). It's promising a news conference tomorrow to discuss unveiling a "transformational" wireless experience. The carrier will reportedly "grandfather" existing customers who are happy with their plans in order to let them keep the terms they want. It still bugs me how Verizon is a beloved and Comcast is hated.And both company are ISP (well the latter is also an Media Conglomerate). You can't stream too much video at less than 10GB per month. Stick with NFLX or Chromecast or Roku sticks. My AT&T internet plan allows for 600GB, good enough for nflx watching. They all are going to raise the amount of data available on an incremental basis.
