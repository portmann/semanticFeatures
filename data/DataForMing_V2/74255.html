Intel: An Expensive Expansive Strategy - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ), in a strategic move, has agreed to buy Altera (NASDAQ: ALTR ) for $16.7 billion in a deal that will cut out another chipmaker. The world's largest chipmaker will pay $54 a share in cash for the maker of programmable logic semiconductors. That is a premium of 11% over Altera's closing share price on May 29 and 56% from March 26, the day before the possibility of a transaction was first reported. Intel is seeking a way to mitigate slowing growth accompanied by rising costs and trying to defend its most profitable business. Altera will become an Intel business unit to facilitate continuity of existing and new customer sales and support. The transaction is expected to be accretive to Intel's non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow in the first year after close. Intel intends to fund the acquisition, which is expected to close within six to nine months, with a combination of cash from the balance sheet and debt. The strategic side of the transaction Intel has been looking for growth beyond the struggling personal-computer market, which has been declining since it peaked in 2011. Altera chips are used in a variety of markets ranging from communications to consumer electronics. Altera's devices can have their function updated, even after they have been installed in end-devices. While they're sold in relatively small volumes, programmable logic usually requires the latest in production technology because it's some of the largest chips in the industry. Intel is trying to find more customers, outside of his own chip business, for Intel's factory network, which is the most advanced in the industry. Acquiring Altera may help Intel defend and extend its most profitable business: supplying server chips used in data centers. While sales of semiconductors for PCs are declining as more consumers rely on tablets and smart phones to get online, the data centers needed to churn out information and services for those mobile devices are driving orders for higher-end Intel processors and shoring up profitability. Creating value takes more than acceptance of value maximization as the organizational objective. All companies affirm to maximize value but that is not true. The choice of value maximization as the corporate objective must be complemented by a corporate vision, strategy and tactics that unite participants in the organization in its struggle for dominance in its competitive arena. That is clearly the case for Intel. The financial economics side of the transaction We define a sustainable competitive advantage as the difference (the performance spread) between the return on capital and the cost of capital (a difference correctly measured, that is after transforming GAAP numbers into a rigorous computation of economic profit, after deducting the full cost of capital, and eliminating the accounting distortions). The higher the performance spread, the bigger the competitive advantage. Also, as a long term value investor, you know that, over time, market value and intrinsic value converge. A company with a positive performance spread, that is a return on its capital greater than its cost of capital, a necessary condition for market value creation, will see it decreases to zero, if it is not able to embark on a new strategic value increasing trajectory. It is exactly what Intel is trying to do in acquiring Altera. Finally, we need to recall that the value of any company (i.e., the market value of total capital) is composed of two parts: the value of assets in place, or the value of the current operations (i.e. the discounted value of the current net operating profits), plus the value of the future growth opportunities. In the simplified approach that we use here, this second part is just the result of subtracting the first part, (i.e. the value of assets in place) from the market value of total capital. The connection with the fundamental risk is simple: The greater the market value of the total capital of the corporation is composed of the value of the current operations, the less significant is the value of the most uncertain part of the total value, i.e. the future growth opportunities. Let us apply these principles to Intel and Altera. In the following analysis, we will see how, actually, Intel, unlike Altera, is on a wealth creating strategic trajectory using our proprietary data and our own valuation methodology based on the integration of the economics of strategy and the principles of modern corporate finance. The performance spreads of Intel have declined steadily from 11% in March 2011 to 7% in March 2015. In the context of a very competitive industry, having a positive spread is already an achievement and it reveals the competitive advantage possessed by Intel. But the decline is there and it tells the urgent need to reinforce the strategic trajectory. Its intrinsic value per share has oscillated around $40 during this period with a maximum of $46 in 2013. It is now $35. At the current market price (May 29) of $34.46, Intel is fairly valued. Moreover, its current operating value represents 92% of the market value of its total capital implying that the future growth value (the part of the value coming from the most risky part of the total valuation) is only 8%. Altera performance spreads have, for the same dates, declined from 16% to minus 1%. Its intrinsic value per share has followed the same drift, declining steadily from $39 to $14 to date. It means that the price of $54 paid by Intel for Altera reveals a premium of 279% over the most recent intrinsic value. At the current market price (May 29) of $48.85, Altera is over valued. Moreover, its current operating value represents 33% of the market value of its total capital implying that the future growth value (the part of the value coming from the most risky part of the total valuation) is 67%. Invest or stay invested in Intel. This stock is a rock-solid choice for the very risk averse investor. It will pay off gradually over the next several years. Anyway, new investors do not have to pay much for the value of the growth opportunities and they buy the value of the assets in place at a fair price.
