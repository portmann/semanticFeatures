The Ideal Acquisition For Apple Is Micron, Not Tesla - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha One of the greatest risks to Apple's iPhone and iPad sales is its ability to secure enough DRAM (at a reasonable cost) when the inevitable shortage occurs in the future. An acquisition of Micron would make Apple the first electronics manufacturer to get its hands on a large quantity of 3D XPoint. 3D XPoint could be Apple's ticket to a larger share of enterprise sales and could help secure Apple's long-term dominance in smartphones and tablets (when the new NVM becomes relevant). An acquisition of Micron could extend Apple's ties with Intel. Gaining an alternative to Samsung in its supply chain mitigates the risk of a likely future strained relationship between the archrivals. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is the most recognized name in the world of electronics. The path to glory was extremely bumpy for the first two decades. That all changed with the release of the original iPod in October 2001. The story of AAPL's meteoric rise from that time to today and Steve Jobs reaching icon status through his role in establishing the iPhone and iPad as the dominant forces in smartphones and tablets is well documented. With the success of Apple over the last fourteen years, the company has created a balance sheet with an enormous amount of cash. While excessive amounts of cash on a balance sheet can put a damper on the potential return for its investors, it is an enviable problem to have. What can Apple do to alleviate the cash drag on its stock performance? The ideal use of cash is to spend it on new projects that will expand the firm's reach and increase profitability to new heights. Apple is famously secretive about the products it is developing. However, the firm's reported interest in building Apple-branded electric automobiles is difficult to dispute. This is just one of what is likely a rather large list of projects that it is currently working on. Even with the future R&D and capital expenditures needed for these projects, there is still a significant amount of excess cash (well over $100 billion) sitting on the balance sheet. The two easiest ways to alleviate the cash drag problem is via dividends and/or share buybacks . Apple is already employing both, but they could easily hike their dividends or increase buybacks significantly. Like fellow tech giant Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ), the excess cash on Apple's balance sheet seems to remain perpetually. Cisco has done hundreds of small acquisitions under the helm of former long-time CEO John Chambers. The big deal that could explain why so much cash remains on Cisco's balance sheet never materialized. Apple has not been nearly as aggressive as Cisco on the M&A front over the years, which leads to a greater probability that the cash drag issue could linger for a very long time. There was a rumor floating around that Apple may be interested in acquiring electric car manufacturer Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ). While an acquisition of an Elon Musk-led automobile manufacturer could aid Apple in speeding up the process of gaining significant market share in the industry, I believe the best acquisition target for Apple lies in its supply chain. The ideal acquisition target of Apple is memory manufacturer Micron (NASDAQ: MU ). With the price of DRAM falling quite a bit over the last six months as a result of oversupply, there does not seem to be an imminent need for Apple to buy Micron. However, I do not expect DRAM supply to remain so readily available for electronics firms over the next few years. I believe a severe shortage will be likely at some point over this time span. What could ensue as a result of a shortage of a critical component in iDevices could be much more dramatic than what happened to PC manufacturers during the HDD shortage that occurred as a result of floods in Thailand in 2011 . By acquiring Micron and shifting its DRAM supply from mostly PC DRAM to mostly mobile DRAM, Apple could fill all of its own DRAM demand via Micron (also would assume some shifting of NAND capacity). This vertical integration (a la Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF )) will provide cost certainty and mitigate the risk of a worldwide DRAM shortage constraining iPhone and iPad production. In a prior article , I wrote about why it makes no sense for Apple to acquire SanDisk (NASDAQ: SNDK ). Apple could guarantee itself an ample supply of NAND (a critical component of iDevices that Micron also makes), but it would risk alienating the world's only three major DRAM manufacturers (Micron, SK Hynix ( OTC:HXSCF ) and Samsung), who would find themselves in direct competition with Apple in the NAND market because all of the big three DRAM manufacturers are also major NAND manufacturers. This risk alone should thwart any mild interest that Apple has in SanDisk. While the lack of DRAM IP and fab capacity at SanDisk makes the largest pure play NAND manufacturer in the world an unattractive investment to Apple, Micron does not suffer from this problem. Micron has the IP and more than enough wafer capacity to meet all of Apple's memory needs (both DRAM and NAND). While Apple tends not to be the first company to release the features found on the iPhone or iPad (fingerprint readers, large screen smartphones, etc.), it frequently serves as the company that popularizes technology features that eventually become standard on all smartphones and tablets. Apple is not the first company to use SSDs (Solid State Drives), but it could play a huge role in accelerating the death of the Hard Disk Drive (HDD). HDDs will be around a year from now. HDDs will certainly be around five years from now and even 10 years from now (albeit with significantly smaller market share as a result of the rise of SSDs). They may still exist (in very limited quantities) after 2030. If Apple buys Micron, it could follow a path that leads to the elimination of HDDs from all (or close to all) of its products in a few years. This could create a massive shift in the SSD and HDD roadmaps. Suffice it to say, Seagate (NASDAQ: STX ) (and Western Digital (NASDAQ: WDC ) to a lesser extent) investors will not be happy. How will Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) feel about a possible Apple acquisition of Micron? I think it would be great news for the long-time king of semiconductors. Intel has a partnership with Micron in which the two companies build NAND together. IMFT (Intel and Micron's joint venture) is likely to be incredibly important to the future of both firms as it has developed industry leading bit density 3D NAND and a new NVM (non-volatile memory) called 3D XPoint that has performance characteristics that are three orders of magnitude better than that of NAND (in terms of speed and endurance). While Apple can likely use all of Micron's DRAM and a good portion of the NAND capacity, it seems likely that Apple could still have some excess NAND capacity. (Estimates for Apple's data storage demand and Micron's 3D NAND bit capacity are difficult to project a few years out.) Fortunately, Intel is dying for more 3D NAND wafers and would happily buy these additional wafers from Apple. With 3D XPoint, Apple could find a way to ensure it is the first electronics manufacturer to get its hands on a large quantity of this high performance NVM. This new technology could give Apple an opportunity to gain traction in enterprise systems. 3D XPoint could also find its way into the iPhone and iPad. 3D XPoint could reduce the DRAM needs of the iPhone and iPad while simultaneously improving performance (in terms of both speed and power consumption) and lowering overall costs (and therefore increasing gross margins). While it may not make sense to have 3D XPoint in the iPhone and iPad today, it is not hard to envision how this new memory technology could find its way into Apple's key products in four or five years (and perhaps even sooner) depending on the demand for system memory within each iPhone and iPad as well as the cost of XPoint relative to DRAM. Having such incredible access to XPoint for smartphones and tablets would be a competitive advantage that could help secure Apple's market share dominance and very high gross margins for years to come. With a Micron acquisition, Apple may have to make concessions to appease regulators. Apple could certainly sell some of its NAND fabs to Intel (or others). Given Apple and Micron's importance to the electronics supply chain, antitrust regulators may pose a significantly more pesky challenge than I present here. Apple would likely want to continue the IMFT joint venture. IMFT has been absolutely fantastic (assuming 3D NAND and XPoint turn out as great as I hope) for both Intel and Micron. As a good partner, Apple may decide to give Intel the foundry deal that the semiconductor giant has coveted for years. Intel would finally have a chance to instantly turn around its failing mobile chip business. The dormant Fab 42 (if it is not being used for NVM production) could be used to build Apple SoCs. Manufacturing Apple's A-series chips could be $3 billion-$4 billion of annual revenue for Intel and could lead to further opportunities for Intel as an Apple supplier. Apple would also likely not be unhappy about using an alternative to Samsung in its supply chain. An Apple-Micron deal is far from imminent. Frankly, the odds against this deal happening are high. (I am still under the belief that an Intel-Micron acquisition is possible and would be more likely than an Apple-Micron combination. An Intel-Micron deal might just be wishful thinking.) The big benefits that Apple could reap from this acquisition would likely not be felt for years. The benefits of the deal will show up only when DRAM (and NAND) shortages occur and 3D XPoint becomes a standard part of the memory hierarchy of high performance systems. At that time, 3D XPoint should begin to trickle into consumer electronics (PCs, smartphones, tablets, etc.). Apple could gain a huge competitive advantage by having a guaranteed supply of DRAM, NAND and XPoint and effectively eliminate what I view as perhaps the greatest risk to Apple's business - suppliers failing to meet its demand for a critical component of iDevices. If Apple consumes most of (or perhaps all of) Micron's DRAM capacity, that would leave the rest of the electronics with just two choices for DRAM. As a result, DRAM prices may rise and squeeze the already thin gross margins of Apple's competitors. While I do not expect an Apple-Micron merger to occur, I believe the benefits that Apple could reap would be significant. I remain long Micron and will likely hold this position for at least a few years as the full story plays out. While I do not factor a potential acquisition of Micron by Apple into a valuation model of Micron, this possibility is interesting and could provide sudden surprise upside someday. Apple investors urging Tim Cook to buy Tesla should be begging the CEO of their company to give a hard look at Micron instead.
