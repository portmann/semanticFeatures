Boeing Can Thrive Without The Ex-Im Bank - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Fears from the loss of the Ex-Im Bank are overblown. Boeing can offer its own financing to compensate for the loss of Ex-Im. As of July 1, 2015, the charter for the Export-Import (Ex-Im) Bank lapsed. This means that Ex-Im can continue working on existing agreements, but cannot approve new loans, guarantees, or insurance. The Ex-Im Bank was established in 1934 for the purpose of financing and insuring exports of U.S. goods for customers that were unable or unwilling to accept credit risk. The news of the lapse has Boeing (NYSE: BA ) investors wondering how a loss of the Ex-Im Bank would affect them over the long-term. Boeing has benefited from the Ex-Im Bank since some of its customers obtain loans through the program. The current situation is only a lapse and will likely be discussed again as Congress just returned from its recent break. It is possible that the Ex-Im Bank will be reinstated. In the meantime, Boeing stated that it will provide financing to compensate for some aircraft purchases for customers that are affected by the lapse. The company has offered financing to some customers before the lapse. My thoughts are that Boeing could expand its finance arm in the event that the Ex-Im Bank was to go away permanently. Currently 15% of Boeing's expected delivery of 750 planes for 2015 is to be covered by the Ex-Im Bank. This would comprise about $14.2 billion of Boeing's expected 2015 revenue of $94.7 billion. Some customers who depended on Ex-Im might be able to find financing elsewhere without Boeing's help. So, Boeing may not have to fill the entire $14.2 billion gap by itself. Extending Boeing's finance business is probably not what the company wants since its primary function is to build aircraft. However, if faced with a loss of the Ex-Im, Boeing could adapt and lend to the customers who are in need. This would create a new revenue stream for the company as Boeing would earn interest on the loans. So, although the company's balance sheet would be weakened a bit by expanding its financing, I don't think a total loss of the Ex-Im bank would be devastating to the company. Boeing is experiencing strong demand from customers in the U.S. and abroad with an eight-year production backlog of 5,700 aircrafts. Since 75% of Boeing's 2015 delivery doesn't rely on Ex-Im financing, the company will continue to thrive as it could compensate for the other 15%. Some recent news for the company shows that Boeing is said to be close to a deal to provide FedEx (NYSE: FDX ) with a large aircraft order. Market Intelligence stated that FedEx is likely to order up to 50 more 767-300Fs and up to 10 777Fs. With the 767 priced at $199.3 million and the 777 priced at $320 million, the total deal is estimated to be worth approximately $13 billion. This would compensate for 93% of the $14 billion worth of revenue derived from Ex-Im loans. If FedEx is ordering new aircraft, United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS ) is also likely to need new aircraft. FedEx ordered aircraft in 2012 and 2006 from Boeing, but UPS hasn't ordered a large number of aircraft since 2007 . Therefore, I would think that UPS would also have a need to order new aircraft as the company keeps up with an expanding economy. Boeing received orders for 20 customers around the world in 2015 from airlines of all sizes. This doesn't include the potential FedEx orders. Since there are so many airlines throughout the world, Boeing is likely to maintain a steady flow of orders going forward. This will keep its revenue, EBITDA, and cash flow growing year-over-year as it has in past years. It is not clear whether the Ex-Im Bank will be reinstated or not. I wouldn't be surprised if it is reinstated. However, if the Ex-Im goes away, I think that Boeing would likely be successful adapting to a new reality. Boeing could adapt by extending financing to customers that need loans. This may not be the preferred direction for the company, but it is possible. I think that Boeing would continue to thrive over the long-term even if Ex-Im were to go away. From an investment standpoint, Boeing looks attractive. I performed a discounted cash flow analysis using the company's WACC of 8.08% as the discount rate. If the company were to grow free cash flow at only 5% annually for the next 10 years, and 3% annually thereafter, Boeing's intrinsic value is $214. The gap between the intrinsic value and the current price of $142 gives the stock a good margin of safety. This doesn't mean that the stock will immediately rise to over $200, but it shows that the current stock price is a bargain. I see the company as a bargain whether Ex-Im is here to stay or not.
