AMD: 2016 Will Mark Something Unique - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) | Seeking Alpha AMD has long trailed Intel both on process technology and CPU architecture. This made AMD's CPU offerings all but obsolete, unable to compete on performance, power consumption and, truly, even in value (though they are cheaper). 2016 will bring an unique development for Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ). For once, it's likely that both AMD and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) will be fielding CPUs on the same process node. This event is the result of Intel delaying its advancement to the 10nm process node, along with GlobalFoundries having struck an agreement with Samsung to use its 14nm process technology. As AMD has already reported, it will launch its Zen core during 2016, and this core will be coming with FinFET transistor technology. This implies it will use the 14nm process node GlobalFoundries got from Samsung. With Intel late to 10nm, this means that at least during 2016 it is highly likely that the top-tier products from AMD will be competing at the same process node as Intel's. Thus, whatever disadvantage AMD might still have at that point will have to come mostly from architecture (I say mostly because apparently Intel's 14nm still carries a bit of advantage over Samsung's). However, there are news in the architecture front as well. AMD has long lagged Intel in that regard, with outdated and rebadged CPUs being particularly famous for their low IPCs (Instructions Per Cycle). AMD tried compensating for this by adding cores and using higher frequencies, but the truth is that AMD's offerings simply haven't been competitive for years. However, the Zen core, besides using a process node which will match Intel's, will also be changing AMD's course on IPC. AMD promises a 40% higher IPC for it: A cutting-edge process node plus a large improvement in architecture should mean a significant jump in performance and power consumption for AMD's leading edge products. While there are no recent IPC benchmarks, there are approximations like single core tests. Still, it's hard to know if a 40% IPC improvement will be enough. There's also no data on frequencies or number of cores which AMD will use, though AMD also announced it is now going for SMT (Simultaneous Multithreading), akin to Intel's Hyperthreading. I think there's a good chance that even with the improvements, AMD won't surpass Intel. However, there's also a good chance that the fight will again become close enough, instead of Intel keeping its presently massive lead. "Close enough" might mean AMD will be able to compete on value. Which it really can't at present. While the story I described above should give AMD a chance during 2016, there is still an entire desert to cross during 2015, where AMD has little if any competitive product in the market. Even in GPUs, where the fight with nVidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) used to be close, AMD is now also just playing catch up with its Fury / Fury X GPUs. These GPUs match nVidia's best. But they don't surpass them, even with their innovative HBM stacked in-die memory promising much higher bandwidth and much lower power consumption. So on the CPU side AMD is done until it introduces the Zen cores, and in the GPU side the most it has at this point is a match to nVidia - which might still allow it to recover some market share. Thankfully, AMD has no large and impending debt maturities. So at the very least it doesn't look like AMD is in near-term danger. If it fails its 2016 attempt, however, this story will change dramatically to the worse. AMD introducing a new CPU architecture during 2016 on a process node as advanced as Intel's is a significant event. It carries with it the chance that AMD might exit, however temporarily, the funk in which it has been for many years. As such, that event will merit monitoring. That said, the short term looks so ugly that between now and then there doesn't seem to be much reason to "buy and wait". The best hope in the short term is simply that AMD's matching of nVidia with its superior HBM tech might allow for market share respite in the GPU market. Anyway, 2016 looks like it might be an interesting year for AMD. I will be sure to pay attention, lest AMD pull an upset on Intel.
