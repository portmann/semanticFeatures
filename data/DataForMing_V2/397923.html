Apple Stock Isn't Perfect, And That's OK - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple has been so successful over the past decade plus that the market expects perfection. For years, Apple met those lofty expectations. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) stock has returned more than 800% over the past 10 years, which blows the S&P 500's 56% gain over that time span out of the water. Apple's returns even tower over Google's (NASDAQ: GOOG )(NASDAQ: GOOGL ) 200% gain in the past decade. Apple rose to the top and became the most valuable company in the world on the back of the iPhone, which brought in, and still brings in, billions upon billions in profit. But this past week we saw something from Apple we haven't seen in more than a decade: quarterly revenue growth declined. Year-over-year ("YoY") revenues declined across Apple's product portfolio, but most significantly, iPhone sales decreased 18% YoY. Apple CEO Tim Cook blamed the decline on macro headwinds and strong sales of the iPhone 6 the year before. However, it has been a long while since we've heard an Apple CEO have to justify the iPhone's underperformance. As a matter of fact, it has never happened before. The iPhone has never seen a quarterly sales decline. Ever. Not in nine years. Throughout the past nine years there have been macro headwinds facing the smartphone industry and strong sales of initial models, so what changed this year? One could say it was the 26% sales decline of the iPhone in China perhaps? That can't be the only reason, because YoY iPhone revenue dropped across every geographical area (except Japan). That includes a substantial 10% decline in the Americas. Perhaps it actually was due to the macro obstacles in the smartphone market? Possible, but Apple's premium offerings have proven resilient when facing these headwinds in the past. I think the most likely explanation for the iPhone's decline this year can be explained very simply: it's a consumer good. An overwhelming percentage of consumer goods follow a product cycle that the iPhone has managed to overcome for the past nine years. However, the iPhone's fall from perfection proves two things: 1. The iPhone is indeed just like every other consumer good 2. Apple is just another tech company with a hit product. Those two assertions are not meant to disparage or criticize Apple in any way. In fact, I think both points are actually healthy for the company's stock. For quite a bit of time now, AAPL has been held back by its perfection. Investors knew the streak of revenue growth would have to end some time, and were turned off from investing in Apple's success when it became clear that it would soon be coming to end. That is why the market shrugs when Apple impresses and punishes Apple when it fails. The company has had nowhere to go but down. But now the perfect image has been shattered, which is a positive development because now Apple has somewhere to go: up. It will take innovation and execution from management, which has thus far not proven up to the task. However, that topic is for another time. Returning to my first point above, the iPhone 6's product cycle from 2014 to the present mimicked the progression of an average consumer good depicted here: The graphic is very simple, but it elegantly illustrates how consumer goods progress over time. With the iPhone, you can chop off the Introduction section of the chart because that is only relevant if the product must gain traction first (e.g. due to lack of consumer knowledge of the product, dearth of supporting infrastructure, etc.) Almost every good ever released to consumers follows the progression of this cycle. For years, the iPhone would not bow to the trend and through upgrade offers, discounting of older models, staying power and brand loyalty, among other factors, the iPhone was able to stave off the inevitable. But there comes a point when the natural progression takes over. Whether it was the faltering of Apple's brand loyalty, high-performance low and mid-priced smartphone competition, or some other factors entirely, in Q2 2016 the iPhone became just another consumer good. A massively profitable and popular one, sure. But still a product that follows the natural progression of a consumer good. And I expect future iPhone models to follow much the same product cycle as the iPhone 6. The current smartphone market does not have room for a premium seller to dominate the entire market's sales for two straight years with essentially the same product. While this might seem like I'm criticizing the iPhone's performance in Q2, that is not my intention. As I said earlier, I think the iPhone's reversion to the mean that all consumer goods must abide and the shattering of Apple's perfect image have paved the way for the stock to finally have another direction to move: up. To evidence the market's expectations of the iPhone, iPhone sales in Q2 and sales guidance for Q3 dropped the stock 8% (and it is down more than 11% for the week). This is despite the fact that the iPhone 7 is coming later this year. The start of a new product cycle. From all the news articles being posted about Apple's first quarterly revenue decline in 13 years and first drop in iPhone sales in its nine-year history, you would think people never thought it would actually happen. All I saw from the Q2 report and Q3 guidance was: "Breaking news! Apple's iPhone product is following the trend for an average consumer good!" Maybe investors and the media are just not used to the concept in regard to Apple offerings, but this is what happens when a product gets to the end of its life cycle. Sales decline, and then it's time for the iPhone 6 to get major price cut and live out its days in obscurity as the next model grabs the spotlight. The iPhone's blast of reality also did the same to Apple. The company isn't some divine entity that somehow always grows the top and bottom lines no matter how big it gets, it's just another tech company that has one of the most successful consumer goods of all time. And because Apple is just another tech company, it cannot rely on the iPhone's success to carry it all the way to the promised land. Apple management needs to use its resources to do what Steve Jobs had the company do best: innovate. Dividends and buybacks are great, but in my opinion, excess cash should not be thrown at shareholders just because; it should be invested in the projects that brought Apple to where it is today. And perhaps Apple has enough money for both and I'm preaching to the choir, but we have yet to see any innovative products since Steve Jobs' death. I'm skeptical about the Apple Watch, and Apple's services segment is doing well, but this is a product company. That's what I, and investors, want to see: products that make themselves necessary and integrate themselves into consumers' lives. I believe Apple has the resources to make it happen, but only time will tell. Regarding the current, short-term state of the stock, perhaps now that the illusion of never-ending growth is broken, the market will beat AAPL around a bit and then finally come to realize that, hey, the company's not perfect, but it's pretty damn close.
