Why Facebook Will Never Make Money With WhatsApp - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha While a lot of noise has been made about the rising popularity of WhatsApp, very few have noticed the rising popularity of Facebook's own Messenger App. At the rate Messenger is growing, chances are that Messenger will become even more popular than WhatsApp in a very short time. Meaning the $19 billion Facebook paid for WhatsApp has gone down the tubes, and shareholders were diluted for nothing. Ever since Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) acquired WhatsApp for about $19 billion last year, everyone has been asking the question of when and how Facebook plans on making any money with WhatsApp. While it is not clear in my mind what Facebook's initial intentions where, as things stand today, Facebook is essentially giving up on the prospect of ever making any money with WhatsApp. The main reason for this is cannibalization. While a lot of noise has been made about the rising popularity of WhatsApp, very few have noticed the rising popularity of Facebook's own Messenger App. And the reason for is simple: In my mind, there is no practical reason to use WhatsApp if you are a Facebook user. With Facebook Messenger, both mobile and desktop users can text, send voice messages and talk to other Facebook users. While the same can be said about other popular messaging Apps, there is one very big difference with Facebook Messenger. Almost all your friends and even people you do not know have a Facebook account by default. What this means is that you do not need to tell your friends to download another messenger App, because chances are (a sure bet I would say) they already have a Facebook account. And since you do not need to beg your friends to download another App, you use Facebook Messenger right out of the box, knowing they will answer you because they have a Facebook account by default. In addition, even if your friends do not have the App installed, you can still text them, send voice messages and even talk to them anyway, if you have the right browser. Not only that, but as far as texting is concerned, Facebook messenger has a real slick and light desktop version that does not even need to be downloaded. Personally I mostly text my Friends on Messenger from the desktop. And while Messenger might not be as good as WhatsApp in many respects, the difference is that you know by default you will able to reach your friends on the other side if you look for them. Why bother downloading so many messenger Apps, when all you need is one? Yes this is really cool and convenient, and it's the reason for the rising popularity of Facebook's Messenger. As you can see from the charts above, as of April of 2014 WhatsApp had about 500 million users, and as of April of 2015 it currently has 800 million users. That's an increase of 60% on a yearly basis. However when looking at Messenger for same time period, user count went from 200 million to 600 million, or an increase of 300%. In fact, my guess is that in a very short while more people will be using Messenger than WhatsApp. So if people will be using Messenger as opposed to WhatsApp, what is the reason for having, let alone paying $19 billion for WhatsApp? I have no idea. I am not sure the reason Facebook bought WhatsApp in the first place. However, what is evident from the data is that Messenger will probably become even more popular than WhatsApp in a very short time. As such, it is clear Facebook will never be able to charge any money for WhatsApp, given Facebook's own Messenger App is free, simpler to use and above all, you take for granted that the people you know will be online to answer your text or voice message. I continue to be negative of Facebook's stock because I think the valuation is more than stretched for my tastes (please consider: Short Twitter And Facebook, They Are Grossly Overvalued ). However given the fact that Facebook diluted the living daylights out of shareholders for nothing, I have become even more negative, for this is a clear sign of management incompetence.
