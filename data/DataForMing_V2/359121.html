PayPal: Vicious Headwind, Valuation And Venmo - PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) | Seeking Alpha With its recent run-up, PayPal's valuation has become stretched. Going forward, Apple Pay could be a headwind for PayPal. Venmo's growth has been incredible and the "Pay with Venmo" button is a natural fit for Facebook's platform. One of the reasons why I enjoy writing for Seeking Alpha is that I can share my young perspective to an interested audience. I think (and hope) my young perspective is of value to older investors, and perhaps sheds light on overlooked or misunderstood aspects of companies. PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL ) is a company I think I can share a good deal of insight and opinion about. If you saw PayPal's Super Bowl advertisement , you know that the company is targeting millenials such as myself. I like PayPal from the perspective of both a user and investor. I wrote about PayPal in a previous article , but I feel the need to write another because the stock hasn't moved much since my last publication, but some of the fundamentals have. There is a new headwind that has surfaced since the publication of my piece, but I think the narrative remains the same: you should be a long-term holder of PayPal. A relatively new headwind for PayPal comes from Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), which said that they plan on launching Apple Pay on mobile sites via their Safari browser. This poses a threat to PayPal because the online payments company handled $20 billion worth of mobile transactions in 2015, roughly one-fourth of the company's total volume. It's true that PayPal's Braintree processes some in-app Apple Pay purchases, but PayPal's profit margin is higher when it processes payments from PayPal accounts. The other side of the coin is that if PayPal can keep mobile volume strong in the wake of Apple Pay, it shows the strength and stickiness of its product. In other words, if Apple can't create an alternative to PayPal - one, I might add, that already comes with the user's phone - then who can disrupt the space? Though Paypal is expected to grow earnings by 14% and 20% in 2016 and 2017, respectively, the se based company trades at a steep 31 times earnings. For perspective, MasterCard (NYSE: MA ) and Visa (NYSE: V ) trade at 26 and 27 times earnings, respectively. At 31 times, PayPal fetches a valuation close to that of its all-time richest, signaling that potential upside could be limited. A premium valuation also means that investors are paying for promise and execution by management. Though PayPal's management delivered strong numbers in the previous quarter, it may be tough for them to keep investors happy going forward because the expectations are so high. PayPal's fastest growing services is Venmo. In my eyes, its potential is enormous. For those unfamiliar with Venmo, consider it a digital wallet with a social component. It replaces traditional payment methods (cash, check, and credit cards) with simple paperless digital payments. It is designed to make it easy for users to share payments with friends and people in close geographical proximity. Venmo makes it easy to pay for things like cabs, the rent or dinner. A few taps replace searching for spare change or writing a check. Not surprisingly, the service is very popular among college students. Since PayPal acquired Braintree, then the owner of Venmo, it has been looking for a way to monetize the digital wallet service. This solution did not come until recently, when Venmo announced they will offer merchants the ability to include a "Pay with Venmo" button for payments. This button gives businesses the ability to offer customers an easy form of payment, and Venmo takes a cut of the transaction. The "Pay with Venmo" button is doubly good for Venmo because it gives users another reason to stick with the service. Many merchants have already opted for the "Pay with PayPal" button, so their adoption of a "Pay with Venmo" button is likely. Plus, the demand is there. According to a survey from Tech.co , 95% of Venmo users said that they would use the "Pay with Venmo" option. Companies such as Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) and Snapchat (Private: CHAT ) have tried to implement payment services similar to Venmo. Facebook implemented a feature into Messenger that allows users to link a card with their profile and send money to friends via a message. Snapchat has a service called Snapcash, which operates in a similar manner. On paper, these services sound like noteworthy competitors to Venmo. However, in reality, these services haven't taken off. Meanwhile, Venmo has been growing at unearthly clips. The company processed a record $1 billion in January, more than 2.5 times more volume than January of 2015, and better than 10 times more volume than January of 2014. This sparks the question, Why haven't Facebook and Snapchat been able to popularize their payment services? As Venmo's growth shows, there is a large demand for "social payment" services, so what gives? In my opinion, the reason is that people simply don't associate Facebook and Snapchat with transferring money (and why should they?). Also, trust has not been developed between the user and these social media companies, so they are hesitant about using them to transfer funds to friends. I attribute much of PayPal's and Venmo's success to their ability to build trust with their users. I cited PayPal's mission statement in my first article about the company, and I'll quote it again here because it is so integral to their success. The company's mission statement has been the same since its inception, and it's a leading reason why consumers trust the service so much. In 2001, the company wrote : "Breaches of our customers' privacy and our security measures [...] could diminish severely consumer confidence in and use of our product." Therefore, PayPal is committed to ensuring the safety of its product for all customers and for years down the road. The trust factor is the leading reason why payment processing from social media companies does not pose a large threat to PayPal. But, while there is not much potential for payment processing from social media companies, I believe there is a place for payment processing on social media platforms. In my previous article, I told a personal anecdote about my experience selling shoes with the help of Facebook groups. I recommended that readers listen to what CEO Mark Zuckerberg had to say about these groups, saying that his remarks could be good for PayPal On Facebook's Q4 conference call , Mr. Zuckerberg said that for the first time, more than 1 billion people used Facebook groups in a single month. More than 50 million small business now use pages on Facebook, and these pages generate more than 2.5 billion comments per month. Facebook has integrated a marketplace feature that allows users to see the price of products, but in order to purchase them, they need to send money via Facebook or use a service like PayPal. Now, imagine if users could purchase items right from their timeline via a "Pay with PayPal" or "Pay with Venmo" button. Such a feature would be a huge convenience for customers and would fill the void of trust between the Facebook user and the payment processing platform. With its recent run-up in price, PayPal's valuation has advanced to a level higher than the valuations of both Visa and MasterCard. This heightened valuation comes at a time in which many believe that Apple Pay will begin to pose a large threat to PayPal, so this headwind will need to be monitored over the coming quarters. If Apple Pay can't compete with PayPal, though, then I don't think any product can. Moreover, Venmo has shown great growth and has great potential going forward. The main reason for Venmo's success is its ability to build trust with users. This is the component lacking from Facebook and Snapchat's alternatives to Venmo, which is why they don't pose a large threat to the service in the long run. Lastly, it will be hard for Venmo to keep growing at its current clip unless it can integrate its "Pay with Venmo" feature into Facebook. It may seem farfetched to speculate such an integration, but it could be a key driver of growth for Venmo going forward. If it happens, I think the sky's the limit.
