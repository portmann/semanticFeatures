Facebook Botches Its Livestream Launch - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha To screen ETFs by asset class, performance, yield and more, check out the ETF Hub. ETF Hub Facebook's live video release wasn't up to par. Facebook stock is still a buy, but it is leaving room for Periscope to control the live video space. Twitter is a buy because live video will have massive earnings potential because it is more engaging than regular video content. Jim Cramer often refers to the market as the "Wall Street Fashion Show". This description is apt in describing the stock performance of Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) and Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ). Facebook is clearly in vogue, while Twitter is hated by most investors. I bought some more Twitter at $28 because I believe the negative stock momentum doesn't reflect what is happening at the company. This article reevaluates the live streaming landscape now that Facebook entered the fray this week with its celebrity-only live capability which works through the Facebook Mentions app. I continue to think Periscope is in a great situation to disrupt online video. Facebook recently came out with the ability to stream live video on its website. Facebook has been verifying many users in the past few weeks, likely in anticipation of this release. Having the correct accounts verified was important since the live streaming capability was only available to these accounts. Having a verified account now has a more important meaning. This launch should not be a surprise to any investors. Facebook has seen Periscope reach 8.5 million active users and doesn't want to get left out of the action. As a shareholder in Facebook, I am highly disappointed in what was released. I am not saying Facebook can't become successful in the future, but so far this has been a step in the wrong direction for the firm. Facebook is a $200 billion company which has over a billion users, yet its livestreaming capability is much worse than Periscope which was acquired for less than $100 million by Twitter earlier this year. It is difficult to give a full assessment of Facebook Live because I can't find any to watch live. I have been messaging the Twitter account for Sympl TV which is a discovery platform for live streamers and they told me they couldn't find any live streams to watch either. I tried to like celebrity accounts on my Facebook, but I have yet to see one live. I have watched many replays of live streams. There have been many glitches where the stream unexpectedly crashed. It made the "Rock" jokingly threaten to call Mark Zuckerberg to get him to come fix the service. The replay streams did not show the comments on the screen like the screenshots Facebook promoted which are shown in live streams. This made it difficult to understand what was going on. Streamers do not repeat the questions they are answering, so it was akin to watching a press conference where you can't hear the question that was asked. The livestream by Lindsey Vonn wasn't great because she didn't answer any of the questions. This made it great for replay viewers, but pointless for live viewers. The idea of Facebook launching live exclusively to verified users may have been the exact wrong thing to do. I have read complaints that Periscope and Meerkat streams are low-quality because the streamers are "nobodies." I disagree with this completely. I would rather watch a video where someone who isn't famous answers my question than watch a celebrity film without responding to questions. In essence Facebook management pulled a Jack Dorsey. For those who aren't aware, Jack Dorsey ignored the Periscope stream when his team recorded the conference call. Livestreams of celebrities will generate traffic, but a high percentage of those views have come from replays. Replays were likely highly promoted by Facebook to make it look like it had a big success with the new announcement. For example, Matthew Santoro filmed a video where he received 4,000 livestream viewers and 82,000 total views. This is much different from Periscope where livestreams generally get more views than replays. I talked to the Periscoper Ashley Daniels who has 20,000 followers. She told me in general a replay getting 50% of the views of a livestream would be the high-water mark. Clearly Facebook, has a massive audience of users, so it isn't surprising that Matthew Santoro's livestream did well. He said typically he receives 1,000+ viewers on Periscope which was less than his 4,000 views on his Facebook stream. Facebook was smart in its release as it only gave users a notification of the stream if they recently interacted with the celebrity who was streaming. It would clearly be annoying if you got a notification from someone's page that you liked 3 years ago. This annoyance is a part of the problem with having streams on Facebook's newsfeed. Twitter does it better because the streams are highlighted on the Periscope app and are just regular tweets on Twitter. On Twitter, native video, Vines, and pictures take up space in the feed, but Periscopes just show links. With the release of Project Lightning, Periscopes will be more prominent, but it will be curated so the experience is easily digestible. There has been discussion about whether Facebook will ever give this live streaming feature to everyone. Brian Fanzo filmed a Periscope where he guessed since Facebook rolled out the feature through its Mentions app instead of Messenger, Facebook didn't have plans to roll it out to everyone. The other side of the argument is Facebook was just using celebrities to test it out. The feature had glitches for celebrities; imagine how poor the experience would have been for millions of people trying it at once. Going back to the former argument, the addition of streaming may not be great for Facebook users because it would clog the newsfeed. As I mentioned, Periscope doesn't overwhelm the Twitter experience. It could be problematic for Facebook. Periscope's launch has gone smoothly because it has grown over time. I wouldn't describe the growth as slow, but if Facebook just launched the feature at once, it would have this same growth in hours instead of months. If everyone on the feature was new to it, it would lead to subpar content which would be even worse than the content which was initially on Periscope. This is why Facebook should utilize the feature in a separate app. The situation may not even work out for celebrities, since replays make up such a large percentage of views. Why bother making a low-quality stream? If you make an edited video, it will get almost the same amount of traffic anyway. My fear is we are seeing a trend toward Facebook creating two classes of people. The celebrity class gets certain treatment, while the rest of us don't get these features. This is what has already occurred with video. Only video creators with millions of followers are allowed to participate in the ad partnership program. There has also been a problem with Facebook failing to stop stolen video from being re-uploaded under a different account without paying the original creator the amount of money the video earned Facebook. I mentioned the possibility of Periscope only allowing video to last longer than 24 hours for verified users to Ashley Daniels. She strongly disagreed with this idea because it would be creating two classes of people. This is the point of Periscope; it allows users to see another person's world without feeling that they are any better than you. Celebrities and other scopers are on the same level of the viewers. This is the exact opposite of what Facebook is doing which makes me decry its actions. Periscope will be the first opportunity for Twitter to create a partnership program like YouTube. I would be strongly in favor of Twitter going down the YouTube path instead of the Facebook path. Content creators need to be respected and compensated well or else the quality of content will decrease. Parachute is already creating a scheduled network for content creation on Periscope. Once Periscope has ads in the next few years, I hope it plans on compensating the creators properly. This creates a relationship with the creators. This creates a moat which prevents scopers from jumping ship to the next popular app. So what does this launch mean for Periscope? It will have no effect on downloads and engagement in the next few quarters. Periscope, Facebook, and Meerkat can all do well without bumping into each other. Meerkat certainly has the lowest probability of success since it doesn't have its own social network to share content on. The way I look at the landscape is Meerkat has the best features, Periscope has the second best features, and Facebook has the worst features. The order is reversed for the amount of distribution with Meerkat having the least, Periscope having the second most, and Facebook having the most. This puts Periscope in the sweet-spot. What will determine who wins in the battle with Facebook is whether Periscope can maintain its lead in terms of features. Looking back at what I anticipated happening in this space, I knew Facebook would come out with some sort of response to Periscope. The fact that it had a response so quickly shows how important Facebook thinks the category can be. I would have been worried for Periscope if Facebook had bought Meerkat because it has a lot of great features. This clearly did not happen. Facebook has decided to create it in-house. Without any ranking system which hearts provide, Facebook will have a difficult time at finding traction. What will determine which stream gets a higher ranking in your newsfeed? Watch time? Watch time isn't as good as hearts which provide proper feedback. As you can see below, Periscope has been trending higher as it is now the 56th most downloaded app in the App Store. Facebook's streaming capabilities only work for iPhone as of today, while Periscope works with both of the major app stores. Periscope has to gain enough popularity before Facebook gets its act together, if it wants to be successful. Meerkat wasn't able to run up the scoreboard before Periscope was launched, but Periscope will have a better chance since it is in the sweet-spot. Periscope has greater distribution than Meerkat and a first-mover advantage over Facebook. In conclusion, as a Facebook shareholder I am very disappointed with Facebook's answer to Periscope. It could have added the feature to Instagram, if it wanted to limit the exposure to beta test it. Facebook needs a separate streaming app for it to work out in the long term. Facebook already has WhatsApp, Messenger, Facebook, and Instagram, so creating another platform may be awkward. What would be even more awkward would be seeing my friends all hold up an iPhone to their faces and answer comments. Facebook mainly connects the user with his/her friends. Periscope and Twitter connects the user with anyone in the world. I don't want to watch my friends livestream. I want to walk the streets of Paris or Rome with a person I would never otherwise meet. Periscope brings you closer to everyone in the world. Because Facebook has done a poor job at responding to Periscope, I remain bullish on Twitter stock. I still will continue to own Facebook stock, because it will continue to get an increased amount of ad dollars to equal the amount of time people spend on its platforms. I am also a believer in Instagram growing into a mainstream app. I already consider it to be a mainstream app, but lately investors have been describing Twitter's 300+ million users as a niche product. Therefore I will go along with their lingo and say Instagram is going to go from niche to mainstream in the next few years.
