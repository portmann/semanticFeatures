2 New Star Wars Theme Parks Will Boost Disney's Parks And Resorts - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Disney will build two massive Star Wars-themed expansions to its parks in Anaheim and Orlando. Disney's goal is to bring Star Wars into every corner of the company. Disney is on track to capitalize from its Lucasfilm acquisition with new movies, new theme parks and a lot of different consumer products. The growing impact of Disney's parks and resorts division lowers the dependence on Disney's media networks/ESPN. On Saturday, Disney CEO Bob Iger gave a speech at the D23 Expo, during which he announced that Disney (NYSE: DIS ) would built two Star Wars theme parks, one in Orlando, and one in Anaheim (Disney already has theme parks in both cities). Both Star Wars theme parks will be about 14 acres, the biggest single-theme expansions ever. The inclusion of Star Wars in Disney's theme parks is a logical step, as Disney is on track to capitalize on its Lucasfilm acquisition not only with its movie division, but also its other operations, like theme parks and consumer products. Bob Iger said, "When we bought Lucasfilm three years ago, we were excited about making new Star Wars films, obviously. But we were also excited about bringing the characters to every corner of the company." Disney's revenues from its parks & resorts division ( source ) Over the last five years, Disney's parks and resorts saw revenues climb at an annual pace of more than seven percent, bringing the total to $15 billion in 2014, which is slightly more than 30 percent of Disney's total revenues. With the Shanghai theme park about to open in 2016 and the new Star Wars expansions in Florida and California, as well as a number of other expansions and renewals, revenues from parks & resorts are poised to grow further over the next years. Disney's parks and resorts division is on track to become a very valuable contributor to its top and bottom line. Below is a table that contains Disney's revenue, operating income and operating margin from the parks and resorts segment for the first three quarters of each fiscal year: As you can see Disney has not only been able to grow its revenues (by 7.5 percent annually), but has also grown its segment operating margin by a total of 480 base points, which leads to operating income growth amounting to 65 percent (18.0 percent annually). DIS Operating Income (TTM) data by YCharts Disney's total operating income grew by only 42 percent in comparison (12.4 percent annually), which means that the portion of income Disney's parks and resorts segment contributes is rising. This, in return, means that some other division's contribution (as a percentage of the total) must be shrinking -- Disney's media networks segment. A lot has been said about Disney's media networks segment being in a bad position due to cord cutting and unbundling, which could lead to lower revenues and earnings mainly for ESPN. Since Disney's parks and resorts division keeps growing at an above average pace, the strength of this segment will help soften the (potential) problems of Disney's media networks segment. With the new Shanghai park opening in a couple of months and the expansion of Disney's existing theme parks, I believe the parks and resorts segment will continue to do very well and keep growing, which softens Disney's reliance on its media networks division, thus diversifying the company further. In contrast to Disney's studio entertainment division, the parks and resorts division is not dependent on a line of blockbusters (which need to be financed), but it is rather a source of income with low additional capital investments required once a park opens. The growing impact of Disney's parks and resorts segment thus helps the company in two ways: It lowers the reliance on Disney's media networks segment (mainly ESPN) and it provides a non-cyclical, steady flow of revenues and cash for Disney. With the new Shanghai theme park and expansion plans (including the two Star Wars parks), this trend will only continue. I rate this as a huge positive for Disney and its shareholders. Additional promotion for Star Wars from its theme parks will also be a positive for Disney's consumer products segment, which will be able to sell even more Star Wars themed toys, actions figures, clothing etc. Disney looks undervalued according to my fair value approach, even though it could be argued that it deserves a higher exit multiple than its peers, since its fundamentals, growth rates (and outlook), as well as its brands would allow for a premium valuation. Disney nevertheless looks undervalued right now, despite being conservative in my approach. Investors thus may use the recent share price weakness to enter (or expand an existing) position in the company. Another way to look at valuation is the discounted cash flow method: DIS Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YCharts Over the last twelve months Disney generated free cash flows of $6.6 billion. Additionally, the company's free cash flow grew 170 percent over the last ten years (which equals a 10.4 percent annual growth rate). Disney is financed through equity (75 percent) and debt (25 percent), as Disney has a debt/equity ratio of 0.33. Disney's weighted average cost of debt is 2.3 percent ( source ). As Disney has a corporate tax rate of 33 percent, Disney's after tax cost of debt is 1.55 percent. ? = beta coefficient = unsystematic risk Using a seven percent market risk premium and Disney's beta of 1.19, as well as a risk free rate of 2.2 percent (US bonds), we get to a cost of equity of 10.5 percent for Disney. Disney's WACC (weighted average cost of capital) thus is 0.67*10.53 + 0.33*1.55 = 7.57 percent. By using Disney's historic FCF growth rate of 10.4 percent annually for the next five years and a lower growth rate (three percent) for the years beyond, as well as a discount factor of 7.57 percent, we get to a present value of $205 billion, which is $25 billion (or 14 percent) more than Disney's current market capitalization. Disney's plan to build two Star Wars theme parks will help its parks and resorts division keep on growing at a high pace, and in turn is an internal diversification from its media networks division. Disney trades below fair value, even when making conservative assumptions. The recent sell-off looks like an attractive opportunity. Disclosure: I am/we are long DIS.
