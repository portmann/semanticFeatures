Russ Fischer: Moore's Law, Chip Companies And What's Next For Tech | Seeking Alpha Apr. 16, 2015  6:51 AM ET  |  Includes: AAPL , ALTR , CREE , IBM , IDTI , INTC , INVN , MU , QCOM , SNDK , TSM , XLNX by: Russ Fischer Intel co-founder Gordon Moore's observation on the development of chip technology continues to impact technology - and investment in the space. Moore's ideas on how powerful computing can become may give investors an idea on technology's next step forward. This month marks the 50th anniversary of Moore's Law, a key observation made in an article written by Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) co-founder Gordon Moore that successfully predicted the number of transistors per square inch on an integrated circuit would double every year. The observation has had a profound impact on computing, helping to usher in the use of everything from the earliest PCs to today's mobile devices. Some have said Moore's Law will eventually run out of steam. Yet the observation has survived the test of time. As technology transitions into a new era, including the often-talked-about move into the Internet of Things (IoT), Moore's ideas on how powerful computing can become may give investors an idea on technology's next step forward. Russ Fischer has written about semiconductor stocks for Seeking Alpha since 2012. He spent 35 years in the semiconductor industry, and now in retirement spends his time "doing the deep research necessary for successful investing." Russ spent some time answering questions fielded by Seeking Alpha Editor Michael Hopkins about Moore's Law, the semiconductor space and what's next for technology. Q: What should investors know about Moore's Law? A: Investors should know that Moore's Law is not a physical law but an observation that Dr. Gordon Moore wrote about back in 1965. Basically, he felt that the number of components per integrated circuit, "at the same cost," would approximately double each year, for the foreseeable future. He never said this phenomenon would continue indefinitely, because the time horizon scope of the article was 10 years. It is interesting that Dr. Moore predicted the "home" computer, automotive controls and "personal" portable communications equipment. We're talking 1965 here. Serious investors could spend 15 minutes and read the original article here . A: Millions of talented people have contributed to and extended the early prediction by Dr. Moore. Dr. Moore's prediction is now 50 years old and seems to have a perpetual time horizon of 10 years. Consider: The Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) A7 Application Processor was 100 sq. mm on a 28nm process. Three nodes earlier was 90nm. The A7 chip, at 90nm, would have been about 800 sq.mm (1.25 sq. in), cost about $10,000 and had more the characteristics of a hot plate than a cell phone processor. Moore's Law made the iPhone possible in 2007 and not very much earlier than that. I like this one for IoT. IoT chips will require sensing, compute with on-chip ROM and RAM, communications (wireless) and security. Who's better positioned than Intel? Consider: The first Pentium processor was made on an 800nm process and was about 300 sq. mm. Eleven shrinks later that Pentium, on 14nm, would be about .15 sq. mm! That's a lot of intelligence that leaves room for the other functions and would still be a $.50 chip with 65% gross margin. That's Moore's Law at work to the extreme. A: You might profit from watching this (Bloomberg video here ). Jack Rivkin thinks "Intel is the most important company in the world." I can't think of another IDM that would have pushed fab technology the way Intel has. If that push hadn't happened many things that we take for granted couldn't exist today. Even IBM (NYSE: IBM ) must have thought that Moore's Law ended at 32 nm. Around 120 nm IBM chose "gate first" lithography that they knew couldn't work below ~45-32nm (but it was easier and cheaper). They took their whole consortium down that road. The only one who went "Gate Last" was Intel. IBM has since sold-off the semiconductor fabs, as they were outmoded. They actually paid Global Foundries a couple billion dollars to take the fabs off IBM's hands. What if IBM had been the keeper of Moore's Law? Q: Some say the observation is becoming dated - that eventually Moore's Law may not matter anymore. Two questions: (1) Your thoughts on this, and (2) does that create an opening for investing in something new? A: Moore's observation is becoming dated in the X-Y dimensions; we still have the Z dimension to exploit. We are seeing the early beginnings of 3D NAND memory. Intel/Micron (NASDAQ: MU ) (the companies' IM Flash is a joint venture) feels that their 3D NAND implementation is "cost disruptive," which is what Moore's Law is all about. There is still a lot of mileage to be had by moving memory onto the CPU. Maybe that will take a 3D logic process or inexpensive TSV (Through Silicon Via) technology. Moore's law has been expanded and re-interpreted by many people since 1965. If we expand performance and value to include performance at low power, perhaps re-arrangement of those billions of transistors to make a PC run on a couple AAA cells continues the value proposition that has always been the heart of Moore's Law. Q: When it comes to traditional tech companies (for lack of a better term) - say Intel and/or Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) - there's one question that surfaces to the top: Is the PC dead? A: Different PCs are born, live and die. We can only see an Apple IIs in a museum. The boat anchor that was my first $5,000 PC is long dead, thank you very much. Notebook PCs are still very relevant. The number of PCs in use is still growing quite nicely. When that number begins to shrink the PC will be dying. Re-fresh cycles are getting extended for several reasons. One reason is that PCs are much more reliable than ever before; they last longer and don't need to be replaced. I might point out that improved reliability is a seldom discussed element of Moore's Law. I also think the poor acceptance of Windows 8 had more than a little bit to do with the decline in PC sales. I would also argue that the PC business has been the victim, to some degree, of the Osborne Effect due to the rapid introduction and early announcement of ever more capable and lower powered CPU devices. With Windows 10 and the Skylake processor right around the corner, we will see if my opinion has any validity. I also feel that the PC industry has done a horrible job of helping users to move data from their old PC to a new PC. Changing PCs has become a dreaded chore for many people. That needs to change. The traditional PC has run into a slow period, while tablets have enjoyed an apparently short period of hyper popularity. Tablets, of course, are PCs, so no, the PC is not dead. A: I think Intel is finally getting traction in mobile as defined by tablet computers and smartphones. Intel made some very expensive, "scorched earth" progress in tablets last year. Their LTE Baseband device is gaining ground at the expense of Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ). The communications chip and processor chip are about equal in value. Not all smartphones use the Qualcomm integrated solution and practically none of the cell network-enabled tablets use an integrated solution. Intel will get their program together on a capable smartphone chip within the next 18 months and, unless the world stops using smartphones, Intel will be a factor. The recent Microsoft Surface 3 is no longer a joke, but a serious computing device. The introduction of the Surface 3 seems to have obsoleted Windows RT which is another little cut to ARM (ARM), TSMC (NYSE: TSM ) and Qualcomm. Q: There's off-and-on talk concerning Intel acquiring Altera (NASDAQ: ALTR ), something that has caught the attention of Wall Street. Could there be consolidation in the semiconductor space? I have to thump my chest a little bit. I was told that I sold the first for-revenue FPGA for Xilinx (NASDAQ: XLNX ). Since Xilinx was the first and only FPGA company, at the time, I sold the first FPGA on planet Earth. FPGAs as accelerators for data center server chips make a lot of sense in a market that seems to demand customization. FPGAs are re-configurable, so a single device could, in theory, execute many different custom algorithms at different times as required by the system. Intel has been quietly doing fab work for a couple of start-up FPGA companies for years - the closest one to marketing a product is Achronix (details here ). Achronix is on the market with FPGAs made on the intel 22nm process. These are very dense, very fast FPGAs that have the distinct advantage of being totally and immediately compatible with Intel manufacturing. I'm surprised that Achronix wasn't the first company to be considered for an Intel purchase. Maybe they will be considered now. Another device that could perform some of the acceleration functions on server CPUs is the Micron Automata Processor ( here ). The acceleration and customization demand on server application will be satisfied by Intel whether through FPGAs or the Automata Processor, or both. Intel will spend any amount of money to defend or enhance their position in the data center business, so Xilinx, Altera or Achronix will come under the Intel umbrella. Any deal would (should) happen in the near future, so maybe the play is Altera/Xilinx call options at about 4-6 months out. Q: Who benefits with further consolidation (should that happen)? A: Consolidation decoded means less competition. In that sense it is short-term bad for consumers of semiconductor devices. Long term, it is good for everyone that the semiconductor industry generates the ROI necessary to continue a high level of innovation… which benefits those same consumers of semiconductor devices. There has already been a lot of consolidation in the semiconductor business and it will continue where it makes business sense. A semiconductor deal that looks highly dilutive to earnings can turn very accretive with some pricing solidification by the acquirer. I would look for candidates that either reduce or eliminate competition in certain product categories as being the companies of interest for further consolidation. Qualcomm could be shopping for some other businesses since their mobile and communication businesses are facing some real competition today. If Intel wants to dominate the IoT market, a sensor company would be a nice tidbit. Invensense (NYSE: INVN ) comes to mind. A: Actually, I am flat on Intel for now. I expect to be back in big for the second half and 2016. I have an eye on Integrated Device Technology (NASDAQ: IDTI ) for their memory support products and power control products. They have an analyst meeting coming up in May. I might be in it before that. The date is not yet announced. The 3D NAND memory shakeout is worth watching. All four suppliers' fabs use a different technology, so there are no 3D NAND technologies with true second sources. Toshiba does the fab for themselves and SanDisk (NASDAQ: SNDK ) and IMFT does the 3D fab for Intel and Micron. Intel is in the unique position of being a true second source to Micron fabs by opening up an Intel-owned 3D NAND fab. The Intel/Micron joint venture allows for that. Simply having a second source could make Intel/Micron (their joint venture) the selected 3D NAND technology. A: I'm still watching for the final outcome in the 14 and 10nm struggle. On the one side is Intel with an ongoing $50 billion in X86 revenue to fund the ever more expensive technology development. The foundries, including TSMC and Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ), are throwing truckloads of money at what amounts to about a $12-15 billion worth of non-Intel bleeding edge business ($6 billion for Apple and $6-9 billion for everyone else.) They are currently spending about twice the amount of the available business. How long can that continue? The rumors are that both TSMC and Samsung have horrible yield on 14nm finfet processes and that the costs of finfet transistors are increasing for the first time, while Intel claims their transistor cost continues to come down. If one of the foundries throws in the towel on finfet there will be an audible worldwide gasp from the bleeding edge semiconductor users. Does Intel go home with all the process marbles? Disclosure: The most recent update from Russ is that he is short Intel puts with the objective of being assigned the shares at a lower cost or keeping the premium. He may initiate a call spread for a short-term small bull play on earnings (which were reported after the close on April 14).
