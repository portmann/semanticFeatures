ETF Hub Dec 15 2015, 18:45 ET | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS ) has lost the highest profile piece of its Maker Studios acquisition, as president Ynon Kreiz -- who took the reins from co-founder Danny Zappin and then sold it to Disney for $500M -- is stepping down . The move coincides with the end of Maker Studios' earn-out agreement with Disney. COO Courtney Holt, who was predicted to leave the studio as well, will take over as executive vice president. Disney had committed $500M to the purchase last year, as well as up to $450M more if performance targets were reached, but Re/code notes that the unit was set to fall short. The studio has continued to grow, to 12B views a month from around 5.5B in spring 2014. Kreiz's departure follows a pair of key departures in August, when Chief Content Officer Erin McPherson and Senior VP of Marketing Jeremy Welt left the company.
