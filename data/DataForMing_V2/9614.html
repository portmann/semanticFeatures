Sprint Customer Satisfaction Far Lower Than Verizon, AT&T, And T-Mobile | Seeking Alpha I compare customer complaint levels for the four largest U.S. wireless carriers: VZ, T, S, TMUS. Complaint numbers are highest by far for S, and lowest by far for VZ; T, TMUS numbers about the same. Counter to expectations, rate of complaints against S appears to have increased significantly in last 5 months. Information supports investment case for VZ; cautiousness around T, TMUS; and lastly, closer scrutiny of S turnaround progress and potential. Using freely available complaint data from the popular customer website ConsumerAffairs , I've derived some insight into the recent customer satisfaction levels for the big four U.S. wireless telecommunications providers: Verizon (NYSE: VZ ), AT&T (NYSE: T ), Sprint (NYSE: S ), and T-Mobile (NYSE: TMUS ). Where Verizon has by far the lowest number of complaints, AT&T and T-Mobile are about comparable, and Sprint has the worst level -- by a factor of about 60% compared to AT&T and T-Mobile. The information supports a strong investment case for Verizon, cautiousness towards AT&T and T-Mobile, and closer scrutiny and doubt around the investment worthiness of Sprint, already much beleaguered compared to the others. The complaint levels for Sprint have been particularly high in the past 5 months, which is unexpected considering new CEO Marcelo Claure's comments in the past two earnings calls, emphasizing the importance of improving customer service and satisfaction for the Sprint business. When reading those earnings reports, I was impressed by Claure's honesty and forthrightness about the need for better customer service. The data I've seen, however, indicates Sprint has a long way to go. It goes without saying that customer satisfaction is extremely important for the business operations of these companies. It drives churn (when it is low); it affects reputation and therefore adoption rates; it affects upgrade potential, or the potential for expansion of services; and it is also important from an investor's ethical perspective -- at least in theory, we might say, speaking tongue in cheek -- that is, assuming the investor possesses such a thing as an 'ethical perspective'. Seriously speaking, most of us have probably had our own horrible experiences with utility or telecom companies, and that's not something we want to support with our dollars. Simply put, I consider customer satisfaction very important. Aside from this, customer satisfaction is one of the more easily gauged factors about the telecom operators, which provide little detailed specifications on the quality or capacity of their network. If we cannot assess their technical specifications, we can at least assess what people are saying about their personal experiences, in forums and on other websites. Before discussing customer satisfaction any further, let's take a second to recapitulate the basic investing theses here. Why should we care about these stocks? First of all, the wireless data market has matured and could provide great business opportunities in the next 1-5 years. I discussed some of these potential market developments in my last article . The two biggest operators, Verizon and AT&T, both have high yields, and Verizon has shown significant price growth in the past 5 years. T-Mobile is positioned to grow and has an important competitive role. Sprint, though facing financial struggles, has a discounted valuation, the third most customers of any nationwide operator, and a sizable asset base. Using current data from recent earnings reports and S&P business reports, we can get a sense of relevant valuations by looking at the ratio of the customers to the market cap of each company. This number reflects how much the market values each company for each individual customer. A low number compared to the average (1.03) indicates undervaluation against the competition. As demonstrated in the chart, Sprint and T-Mobile's businesses are valued much less per wireless customer than the 'big two'. In this section I'll show how I've made my analysis from looking at complaints on the website ConsumerAffairs . Though this is just one place of many on the internet where customers can submit their complaints, it has a high enough volume of complaints and a prominent enough space in Google results to make it arguably representative of overall customer opinion. I'll also point out the relatively recent results published by Consumer Reports . These showed that Verizon ranked best in voice and data service, but lowest in value; evidently, you get what you pay for as a wireless consumer. Sprint came dead last -- not just among the big four, but also including the other, smaller providers -- with middling results in voice and text and poor results in data and value. These results are corroborated by what I've seen from personally inspecting the complaints listed on ConsumerAffairs. Note that ConsumerAffairs is for-profit organization, so its data has no guarantee of neutrality; nevertheless, it allows us personal insight into the customer satisfaction of each carrier. Tabulating all the 1 and 2 star (out of 5) reviews given for each carrier over the past four months, and then normalizing these by the number of wireless customers for each provider (listed in the chart above), I created the graph shown below. (Note I have used complaints specifically from the pages for VZ , T , S , and TMUS [ 1 , 2 ].) As can be seen, Sprint gets many more complaints than the other three carriers, and about 60% more complaints than the next two. Verizon ranks much better than the other three carriers; it is better than AT&T and T-Mobile by an extraordinary factor of 11. The accounts on ConsumerAffairs that make up these complaints are related to poor service quality, contractual disputes, and all sorts of reasons. In terms of absolute numbers, AT&T gets more complaints in some months than Sprint; but AT&T wireless has many more customers. Having acquainted myself more closely with Sprint's business in the past week, I had become interested in the possibility of the company's turnaround story playing out. Sprint was bought out by SoftBank in 2013 , a highly successful Japanese telecom firm, but has struggled to improve financial results since then. New CEO Marcelo Claure was appointed this past summer, and has specifically mentioned improvement of customer satisfaction as one of his biggest priorities in the past two earnings calls. Based on the above analysis, this clearly wasn't just a 'feel good' story; Claure identified Sprint's customer experience as being a key problem for the company. In the past two earnings calls, he had discussed several initiatives to improve customer satisfaction; the establishment of a new, elite level call center at company headquarters, and concentrated efforts on improving network quality so that customers get what they pay for. I've made some changes to my leadership team ... to better understand our customer needs and experience .. and have asked my lead team to periodically sell in our retail stores and take customers services calls directly. -- Marcelo Claure, Sprint Q3 2014 Earnings Call Based on the above quote, as well as the tone and content of the rest of his commentary, I believe the company leadership is putting sincere work into improving customer satisfaction. Nevertheless, the complaint results don't paint a pretty picture. Below, I've plotted the complaint results for Sprint over the past 10 months. They show that the complaint level has risen significantly since Claure took over. The increase in rates is likely due to the aggressive promotions which have been attracting more customers, as well as the new credit-quality restrictions Sprint has been imposing, causing more connections to be disqualified or deactivated. Regardless, it shows that Sprint management has a long, hard road to go to turnaround the company's financial results. The complaints that I've seen justify placing a significantly higher valuation on Verizon than its competitors. On the other hand, the complaint levels for Sprint don't support its valuation, which is actually higher than T-Mobile's on a per customer basis. Sprint has a lot of work to do to improve its customer experience, both on the network side and on the side of customer relations. It has the unenviable position of desperately needing to increase income while at the same time making its customers significantly more happy. In navigating this position, Sprint has made moves like releasing aggressive price promotions which are nonetheless chock full of caveats, as described by Mike Gikas at Consumer Reports. Needless to say, it will be a long road ahead.
