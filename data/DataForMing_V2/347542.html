Starboard is launching a plan to remove Yahoo's board - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha Mar 24 2016, 04:14 ET | By: SA Eli Hoffmann , SA News Editor Yahoo's (NASDAQ: YHOO ) activist investor Starboard plans to announce this morning that it will nominate nine directors to Yahoo’s board, following through on its threat to shake up the board. In a letter, Starboard says the board and management have continually failed to live up to their own promises, and shouldn’t be trusted with the decision on whether or not Yahoo should remain an independent company. A win by Starboard in a vote likely to be held "a few months from now" would increase the likelihood of breaking up Yahoo; Starboard has warned that “turning around this business is extremely difficult” and has said it believes there are several “interested and credible buyers” for the core business. Among Starboard’s nominees are dealmaker Tor Braham, technology executives Dale Fuller and Richard Hill, media executive Eddy Hartenstein and Starboard’s own CEO Jeffrey Smith.
