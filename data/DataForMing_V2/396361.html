Apple: Icahn's Fear Of The Unknown - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Worries about government control, not the economy, were the reason. Last week was not a pleasant one for shareholders of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). The company's earnings report may have signaled the end of an era in the short term, and then billionaire Carl Icahn announced that he had exited his position in the company. Strangely enough, the "negative" reason for which Icahn exited could be similar to a similar "positive" reason for why he could eventually get back in. It was the great investor fear of the unknown, not worries about the Chinese economy, that led Icahn to sell . He's worried about what the Chinese government could tell Apple to do or not do. Political risk is always in play when you are dealing with multinational firms, and Greater China was Apple's second largest revenue region during its fiscal Q2 period. That's despite the region reporting a 26% fall in revenues over the prior year period. Icahn's decision to exit will likely lead to some mixed feelings. On one hand, you can't blame him for taking a profit, as he stated he made about $2 billion on his Apple shares. On the other hand, Icahn was the one that continued to state Apple was worth much more, perhaps even $200, more than double where we are currently. The latest results probably would take down that price target a bit, but you have to feel that Icahn still believes Apple shares are significantly undervalued. Icahn said he hopes to get back into the stock someday. One must wonder if a reason similar to the one he exited for could be the trigger. This reason also is political, but one that has to do with the US government. As many know, Apple's huge cash pile is mostly located outside the US, unable to be used for dividends and buybacks. These foreign funds have grown substantially in recent years, as seen in the chart below. Apple doesn't want to pay a huge tax bill, so it won't return these funds home until the current tax situation changes. But with more than $200 billion now held internationally, a tax repatriation holiday or reduced rates could do the company a tremendous favor. With no additional taxes being paid, Apple could pay off all of its roughly $80 billion in debt and still have more than $130 billion left. That cash could lead to even more dividends and buybacks, making the stock much more attractive to investors. Even with the China fear overhang, I would think Icahn might jump back in if we get a favorable resolution on the tax situation. Carl Icahn announced last week that he had sold his position in Apple, but it may not be for the reason most expect. Despite a bad earnings report and depressed short-term results, Icahn detailed a fear of the unknown regarding the Chinese government and what it could do to Apple's future. On the flip side, we have a similar situation with the US government and its tax code that could be a huge positive for Apple. If the company could bring home its ever growing overseas cash pile without huge tax consequences, it wouldn't surprise me if Icahn decided to get back into Apple.
