Markets Are Irrational About Oil - Cramer's Mad Money (12/22/15) | Seeking Alpha Dec. 23, 2015  7:42 AM ET  |  Includes: AAPL , CBRL , FIT , GPRO , HAR , LUV , P , PAY , PAYX , SNDK , WDC by: SA Editor Mohit Manghnani Restaurant stocks are struggling due to rising labor costs. Stocks discussed on the in-depth session of Jim Cramer's Mad Money Program, Tuesday, December 22. The rise in crude price is leading to stocks moving higher. Investors are worshiping the wrong god in Cramer's opinion as he calls the market a cray town. Only 7% of the S&P 500 does better with higher energy prices, still the entire market is closely linked to the price of oil. There are 3 reasons why the market moves higher when the price of oil rises. Higher price of oil means less stress on the system. Oil price of $45 is required to keep the most troubled companies alive. Higher oil price takes heat off the meltdown in MLPs, which investors buy due to high dividends and not growth. "Put simply, this group has been one of the great disasters of the era. I cannot believe how poorly they have performed," said Cramer. Higher oil price means more demand than the people realize. "I don't buy this argument for one second because while demand might be greater than in 2008, the supply of oil is also much, much bigger, particularly here in the United States," said Cramer. Most problems in the market are due to oil. Cramer went off the charts with the help of technician Carley Garner to figure out the direction of oil. "This relationship between currency and oil often gets overlooked," said Cramer. Crude is not only a supply issue, but also a currency issue since it is priced in dollars. As the dollar gets stronger, oil get weaker. There is high co-relationship between crude and the euro since they both get weaker as the dollar gets stronger. In Garner's opinion, both oil and the euro are closer to a bottom. The co-relation charts since 2006 show that the relationship gets stronger near tops and the bottoms. Since both the euro and oil have been trading together lately, they could be near a bottom. The euro moves first and then oil follows. Garner also thinks that the Fed's rate hike was already baked in the price which is a hint that the euro will rebound significantly followed by crude. The RSI of the weekly chart has been moving higher even though crude has declined. This is a signal that oil could begin a rally soon. There is a strong floor of support at $33.80 and on the flip side, if oil can manage to break through the wedge pattern at $40, it might run to the $60s before it sees any resistance. "I don't know if her predictions will come true, but if Garner is right, that would be very good news for this crazy-town stock market," said Cramer. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) should buy these companies Apple seems to have been stalled these days on the pretext that it cannot achieve higher numbers in 2016. "Many professional investors have come to believe that Apple cannot maintain its earnings momentum because it doesn't have enough large streams of recurring, higher-margin revenue to offset what could be a slowdown in iPhone sales," said Cramer. Apple has done well under CEO Tim Cook's management and it will continue to do so. To achieve the desired growth, Cramer laid out a plan for Apple in which it should buy 4 companies. Apple should buy Harman International (NYSE: HAR ) which is valued around $6B currently. It is the brains behind every major car brand on the road and by buying this company, Apple can be amongst the Internet of Things for cars for less than $10B. "Why Apple won't do this is pretty strange if you ask me, because Apple's CarPlay needs to play ball with more companies, just like Harman does, and Harman's stock is no longer expensive," said Cramer. To become a leader in the music business, Apple should buy Pandora (NYSE: P ) which is valued at $4B. Apple already dominates the high-end watch category. To own the lower end of health and wellness brand, they should buy Fitbit (NYSE: FIT ) for a premium. An offer of $8B will be apt for the company. Lastly, Apple should buy VeriFone (NYSE: PAY ) for $4B to get an installed base of users for Apple Pay. For less than $25B, Apple could own all these companies that will give investors reason to own the stock in 2016. "Honestly, it makes so much sense I can't believe they haven't thought of it themselves," said Cramer. CEO interview - Paychex (NASDAQ: PAYX ) Paychex, the payroll processor reported better than expected earnings and yields 3.2%. Its stock is up 11% since September. Cramer interviewed CEO Marty Mucci to know what lies ahead for the company. Paychex is a winner from last week's Fed rate hike. The company sits on cash since there is a time lag between the company paying cash and the paycheck being deposited. "Every 1 percent increase is about $20 million on an annual basis. So, this first quarter point is worth on an annual basis about $4-5M basically to the bottom line for us," said Mucci. He also commented on the economy by saying that new business formations remain strong and the overall economy is steady. The West and the South Coast are showing stronger growth. The sharing economy is also growing which leads to a spike in temporary employment. The company is gaining more market share due to technological advancements and their new cloud platform. Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV ): Don't sell the stock. With oil so low, it should move higher. Cracker Barrel ( CRBL ): It's going down as people are worried about rising labor costs. GoPro (NASDAQ: GPRO ): There are better stocks like Fitbit one should be in.
