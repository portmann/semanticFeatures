( afagen ) Nearly a year after Facebook overlord Mark Zuckerberg said the company was kinda, sorta looking into creating a “dislike” button for all those posts you, well, don’t like, he says the social network is on the cusp of unveiling a companion for the often overused thumbs-up sign. Zuckerberg announced that the company was gearing up to unveil the option for negative Nellies during a town hall meeting at Facebook headquarters on Tuesday , reports USAToday. “It’s important to give people more options than just ‘like’ to help express empathy,” Zuckerberg said. “Not every moment is a good moment.” For years Facebook has stood steadfast against a dislike button, saying the option could be perceived as bullying or shaming other users. The company’s aversion to a thumbs-down button appears to have been wavering, as Zuckerberg noted in the town hall meeting that there were certain instances in which a “dislike” would come in handy, such as a family death or a crisis.
