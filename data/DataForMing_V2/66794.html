Buy More Disney - Cramer's Lightning Round (5/22/15) | Seeking Alpha Paccar (NASDAQ: PCAR ): "It acts much better than Cummins (NYSE: CMI ), to tell you the truth. I happen to believe that the truck build is going to be good, so I am on the side of Paccar." Disney (NYSE: DIS ): "Disney has two catalysts; it's got Star Wars coming up in the fourth quarter and it's got Shanghai Disney next year. So you have got to hold on to it and hope it comes down so you can buy some more Disney." Seagate Tech (NASDAQ: STX ): "I think it's stalled right here, because in the end it is still related to PCs. But Seagate is a very inexpensive stock, and I would not trade it." Exelixis (NASDAQ: EXEL ): "It's another cancer play that is very speculative. Far more speculative than the previous one that we talked about. Let's be careful out there." Student Transportation (NASDAQ: STB ): "This thing is now yielding 8% and that is where I start getting nervous because I don't like that kind of high yield. Why? Because it's a classic red flag."
