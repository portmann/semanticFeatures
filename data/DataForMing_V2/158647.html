Netflix: Zen And The Art Of Entering Japan - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Japan is the next country Netflix plans to enter. Netflix is adopting a "go slow" strategy to give consumers time to learn about and try the company's streaming video. By avoiding the mistakes Hulu made when it entered Japan, Netflix could create a long-term business there. Netflix is tying up with SoftBank's leader Masayoshi Son to get Netflix into stores and on Softbank's mobile phone network. Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) is continuing on with its overseas expansion, and one of the next markets to tackle is Japan. It's one of the remaining 150 countries that Netflix plans to enter over the next two years. But Japan requires some finesse and time. Although Japan has a relatively large population that offers good potential growth, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings tempered expectations of a quick expansion there, saying recently he thought market penetration would be one of the company's slowest to reach a certain level because Japanese are brand conscious. That means if they aren't familiar with the name or company, they are wary of even giving a new service a try. Netflix's real business success will be in the long term - after the expansion is completed - and the company must understand how each country operates according to their perception of things. The solution for Japan? Go slow. The flip side to brand consciousness is that when Japanese consumers finally get comfortable with a new company or service, then it can be adopted pretty quickly. Once Netflix is part of the "in" group, then subscribers are quite loyal. Also, Netflix needs to avoid the mistakes Hulu made. Hulu entered Japan in 2011, yet according to Netflix CEO Hastings that company charged too much at the beginning. Because Hulu didn't take the time to make deeper relationships with consumers, the relatively high $15 subscription kept the company at the fringe. Netflix's base monthly fee will be around $5.40, almost a third. Netflix has a plan, so you shouldn't worry about profit margins just yet. By creating some buzz about Netflix in Japan, consumers will get to know it better and the price won't be a hindrance. The strategy is to have Japanese subscribers take the steps up to higher subscriptions for faster downloads. Revenue growth could be a little slower than in other countries at first, but loyal customers will make it reliable and steady for Netflix. I think Netflix made one more smart move to get into the "in" crowd quicker. The company has made a deal with SoftBank, a leading Japanese tech and mobile carrier company. SoftBank's head and CEO Masayoshi Son is famous in Japan because of his business and tech skills, and is thought of as the "Bill Gates of Japan." By hooking up with Softbank and having agreed to sell Netflix subscriptions through Softbank shops as well as its website, Netflix becomes part of the "in" group that customers will be more open to try because it's coming through Softbank. Softbank has a mobile phone network of 37 million customers. And for new phone sales, from October this year Softbank will pre-install Netflix's app on new phones. That makes Netflix part of the home team for service. Nomura Securities analyst Anthony DiClemente estimated that by 2020, Netflix could have as much as 5 million members in Japan, or about the same as the UK. That's great for the business, but shareholders want to know when the international expansion turns from cost into earnings. According to Netflix CFO David Wells in the earnings call, international losses should peak in 2016. Investors should underline the word "peak" because that doesn't mean turn to profit. However, you can start to see the horizon as revenues from all the entered countries rise and the cost of entering the remaining countries comes down. Also, in Europe, fees for new members will rise from a little under $10 to a little over $11, so a bit more than 10% up. This will help Netflix's total revenue and get the overseas expansion one step closer to (hopefully) positive operating earnings. That price increase is an important strategy for Netflix's future profitability. Among the same members, Netflix wants them to steadily migrate to the higher subscriptions. At the same time, when a market seems satisfied with the service and movie selection it receives, then it may be safe for the company to bump up membership fees. But just like Japan, it needs to go slow in price adjustments. What it learns in Japan can be applied to expansions in other countries. The growth story of Netflix is still intact, so I think Netflix stock will start heading back up after selling off quickly in August. It's still slightly down from the China market decline, so take advantage of the remaining discount and pick up some stock.
