Boeing's Paris Air Show Encore - Announcing A New CEO - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Jun. 26, 2015  4:41 PM ET  |  About: The Boeing Company (BA) , Includes: EADSY , UTX by: Alpha Now at Thomson Reuters The 51st International Paris Air Show (from June 15-21) featured dozens of aircraft in the skies above Le Bourget Airport. The usual entertaining dogfight between Boeing Co. and Airbus Group continued. This year, Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSY ) slightly outmaneuvered Boeing (NYSE: BA ), landing total business of 421 aircraft worth $57 billion compared to Boeing's 331 aircraft worth $50.2 billion as covered in this Reuters' story - Factbox: Airbus, Boeing orders at Paris Airshow . Not to be shown up, Boeing sent a sonic boom through the aerospace and defense sub-industry with a June 23 news release announcing a new CEO. Dennis Muilenburg, currently Boeing's COO, will take over as CEO effective July 1. He will succeed 10-year incumbent CEO W. James McNerney, Jr., who will continue as chairman until he retires in February 2016. With a new leader at the helm, can the industry giant stay its course and keep earnings quality on track? Muilenburg takes control at time of turbulence for the industry. Boeing's portfolio has shifted due to the federal government's sequestration spending cuts and the company's launch of several new commercial programs: the wide-body, long-range 787 Dreamliner that entered service in 2011; a fuel efficient, single-aisle 737 Max scheduled to enter service in 2017; and the 777X wide-body scheduled for 2020. The Commercial Airplanes segment now accounts for 84% of trailing four quarter (T4Q) segment revenue compared to 69% in Sep. 2013, and 75% of T4Q operating income. One issue is that the launch of these commercial programs, backlog of 5,700 aircraft (as of May 25), and demand for a similar ramp-up for competing Airbus models, have created a supply issue that will need to be addressed. This topic raised headlines during the Paris Air Show when executives at both companies raised the possibility of ramping up output to 60 or more in 2017-2018, according to this Reuters' article - Supply chain wary as Airbus and Boeing push output envelope . Muilenburg will need to deal with options related to a major development concerning Boeing's Defense, Space & Securities business segment as well due to another shocking aerospace & defense announcement of a sudden change in CEO. On Nov. 24, United Technologies Corp. (NYSE: UTX ) announced that CEO Louis Chenevert would be replaced immediately by CFO Gregory Hayes. Under the new leadership, UTX later announced on June 15 that it would spin off its roughly $8 billion Sikorsky Aircraft unit to focus on its core business. According to this Reuters' article - United Tech to exit Sikorsky helicopter business , Boeing has expressed interest in a deal for Sikorsky, the U.S. military's largest helicopter supplier. While Muilenburg will face some difficult challenges as Boeing's new CEO, he has the benefit of running a company that has demonstrated its ability to produce some of the highest-quality earnings. The quality of earnings has been shown repeatedly to be an important indicator; those companies whose earnings come from sustainable sources are likely to generate better financial results over the longer term. Boeing has a StarMine Earnings Quality (EQ) score of 99 on a scale of 1 to 100, with 100 representing the highest-quality earnings. That puts Boeing near the top of companies in North America, which is a bullish signal. Like its new line of jets, Boeing is becoming more efficient. Mar. 2015 T4Q revenue grew 4.8% from the prior year to $92.4 billion while T4Q EBIT accelerated by 20.5% to $7.6 billion. The EBIT increase provided a boost to T4Q operating margin, which has steadily increased over the past four quarters to 8.3% in Mar. 2015 from 7.2% a year ago. However, this is still below the Aerospace & Defense industry mean of 11.7%. This helped to lift T4Q return on net operating assets (RNOA) over the past four quarters by 4.6 percentage points to 32.0%, which soars high above the industry mean of 15.0%. The main reason that Boeing is able to maintain its elevated T4Q RNOA position relative to the industry is due to its net operating asset turnover (NOAT). Asset turnover measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate revenue, and our model measures both the absolute level and the rate of change in asset turnover. The T4Q NOAT has consistently outperformed the industry mean and increased 0.06 to 3.87 in the past year, a level well above the Aerospace & Defense industry mean of 1.36. Exhibit 3: Boeing's T4Q RNOA vs. Industry Mean 1Footnoted periods use the minimum divisor of 25% of T4Q average total assets for T4Q average net operating assets, for T4Q average net operating assets which is greater than T4Q NOAT. Boeing's T4Q performance demonstrates management's ability to choose and implement the right strategies, and as COO, Muilenburg has been a major contributor. One of the tests going forward will be to see how well he can gain altitude for the transition from commercial launches to a large production ramp up.
