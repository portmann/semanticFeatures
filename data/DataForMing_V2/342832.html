'Bright' Acquisition A Game Changer For Netflix - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Netflixâ€™s advancement into the world of film took another step last week with the acquisition of action film â€œBright." Netflix won a bidding war for the project which adds a glorified blockbuster to its ranks of original projects. â€œBrightâ€? star Will Smith may not be the same draw he once was but his name still garners attention and is a big get for the streamer. If you want to go see the latest Will Smith film this year you'll need to go the theaters. No, I'm not talking about the Screening Room controversy that is currently dividing Hollywood. I'm talking about Netflix's (NASDAQ: NFLX ) latest move. Last Friday it was reported by top industry site Deadline that the streaming giant has managed to top itself again with its latest acquisitionâ€¦ Bright. Starring Will Smith and directed by David Ayer, the film found itself in the middle of a bidding war among studios and in the end Netflix won out. As has been the case all along, in order to get the rights Netflix had to bid much (much) higher than its rivals. Here it was nearly double and $90 million later Netflix had its prize. The film is important to Netflix for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that it could turn into a franchise. For investors though it important because it represents the next phase of the company's business model - blockbuster feature films. Having already conquered the small screen, Netflix decided its first entrant into film would be in the awards race in order to first gain credibility. Following the well-received Beasts of No Nations and the acquisition of War Machine, which is expected to be its entry in next year's race, the streamer is now looking more commercially successful. Netflix's deal with Adam Sandler for four films was the first step in this process and now it's thinking bigger. Of course this will lead to the inevitable questionâ€¦is Will Smith still as profitable as the high premium Netflix is seemingly putting on him and his drawing power? Those asking the questions aren't necessarily wrong to pose that inquiry. Remember, the last time Will Smith had a summer tent pole release, it didn't go well. The 2013 action drama After Earth was mercilessly beaten on by critics and audiences. Rotten Tomatoes has the film at a 37% likeability rating with audiences and an anemic 11% fresh with critics. Suffice it to say it was not Smith's best work. While the film itself had issues, the biggest problem was the fact everyone felt this was Smith trying to gift a blockbuster to his son, who also was his co-star. Audiences wanted nothing to do with it and Smith hasn't put out action film since, instead focusing on more dramatic rolesâ€¦ that is until this year. Suicide Squad is going to be one of 2016's biggest films. Warner Bros. (NYSE: TWX ) second film in DC's new connected universe of movies centered around its heroes and villains. Smith is playing a big role in that launch and he along with director David Ayer are largely being viewed as why the film is expected to live up to the hype. Bright, a Men In Black style film about a cop teaming with an orc in a world where humans and mythically creatures live side-by-side, was heavily courted by Warner Bros. which was hoping to land the project to capitalize on the expected success of its shiny new toy. Netflix though had no problem playing spoiler. Netflix is basically giving the producers and the creative team (including $3+ million to writer John Landis) payment upfront essentially eliminating any risk on their part. In this age of the box office when no original pictures are a sure thing anymore, that's valuable. Of course it is also valuable to Netflix. Like with Sandler, the deal isn't about a domestic play, it's about a global one. Netflix can comb through its data and see which stars play well both in the States and internationally and then double-down on those names. Say what you want about Smith, but he's always going to be a bold-faced name and he's always going to bring star power to whatever he's in (even to something as under-valued as Concussion, in which he was brilliant). As a result, all sides seem poised to win on this deal. Subscribers win out because it's a summer blockbuster level project, investors win out because it will likely up the subscriber count and the company itself wins because it continues to gain the credibility it has been building for years. Who knows? If After Earth had been a Netflix film maybe it wouldn't have been regarded as such a terrible film. Then again Netflix is too smart to stick its foot into something like that. Instead its executive team waited for something like Bright which feels like the organic next step in the evolution of a media power house.
