Check your browser settings or contact your network administrator. When promoting their Prime Day deal festival ahead of time , Amazon made sure customers were aware of one potential deal: the Everything Store planned to sell a 40-inch, 1080p LED LCD TV for $115. That’s a great deal, especially for people who aren’t into smart TVs. Yet while many shoppers stayed glued to their screens watching for hot electronics deals like these, the TVs disappeared within mere seconds. Some shoppers claim that they never saw the TV as a Prime Day deal at all, which isn’t true: reports from the ever-vigilant posters at SlickDeals are that the deal did show up, but sold out within seconds. This item from TCL is supposedly the item that was the Prime deal. With such a large TV at such a low price being so heavily promoted, it’s not surprising that the set sold out quickly. A few users report getting Amazon to price match a newer version of the same set last night, but otherwise you’re out of luck for this deal.
