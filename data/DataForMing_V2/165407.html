Top 10 Dow Dogs Yield 3.5% To 5.6% As Of September 4 | Seeking Alpha Sep.  7, 2015  8:53 PM ET  |  Includes: CAT , CVX , GE , IBM , KO , MCD , PFE , PG , VZ , XOM by: Fredrik Arnold Ten top Dow dividend dogs disclosed yields averaging 4.18% per IndexArb or 4.06% per Yahoo Finance as of market close on September 4. The IndexArb projection showed that dividend rose as the price dropped to post a bearish signal for the top ten Dow September selections by yield. Yahoo Finance also saw the dividend rise as price plummeted to report a retreating bear signal for their top ten Dow September selections by yield. IndexArb selected CVX, VZ, CAT, XOM, GE, PG, PFE, IBM, MCD, and KO. Yahoo Finance chose CVX, VZ, CAT, XOM, PG, GE, IBM, MCD, PFE and MRK as top dogs by yield. Yield (dividend / price) results from IndexArb and Yahoo for 30 Dow industrial stocks as of market closing prices September 4 led to four actionable conclusions detailed below. Investors have utilized Michael B. O'Higgins ' dividend dog ranking system to select portfolios of five or ten stocks in the Dow Index to trade as of the last day in December since 1991, when he wrote the book "Beating The Dow" (HarperCollins). Thereafter, dog investors awaited annual results from their investments in the lowest-priced, highest-yielding stocks and trusted that the price of every stock they now owned would climb higher (having locked in a high yield percentage at purchase). Now named Dogs of the Dow , O'Higgins' system works to find bargains in any collection of dividend-paying stocks. Utilizing analyst price upside estimates has expanded the stock universe to include popular growth equities, if so desired. McGraw Hill Financial , publisher of this index, states: "The Dow®, is a price-weighted measure of 30 U.S. blue-chip companies. The Dow® covers all industries with the exception of transportation and utilities, which are covered by the Dow Jones Transportation Average™ and Dow Jones Utility Average™. While stock selection is not governed by quantitative rules, a stock typically is added to The Dow® only if the company has an excellent reputation, demonstrates sustained growth and is of interest to a large number of investors. Maintaining adequate sector representation within the indices is also a consideration in the selection process." Dog Metrics Rated Dow Stocks by Yield in Two Ways The top ten Dow dogs by yield from IndexArb after August included seven of nine business sectors: basic materials (2); technology (2); conglomerates; industrial goods; consumer goods (2); healthcare; and services. (Financials did not make the top ten, and Dow rated utilities in a separate index.) IndexArb describes their dividend estimating strategy thus: "The "Estimated Dividend" for each stock below is our best estimate of the per share amount that will be paid during the next year, beginning on Sept-08-2015. Most companies pay dividends on a quarterly frequency; some pay annually or semi-annually. The amount, timing, and growth of each dividend is forecasted from several years of dividend history, provided, of course, that the company has an established track record. Otherwise, the most recent (perceived) dividend policy is extended." Top ten Dow dogs by yield from Yahoo Finance after August also included seven of nine business sectors, including two basic materials firms, two technology firms, and two healthcare concerns. It may be safe to describe all the Yahoo Finance dividend estimates as "the most recent (perceived) dividend policy... extended." According to both IndexArb and Yahoo, one of two basic materials led their dog teams: Chevron Corp. (NYSE: CVX ) [1]. Technology firm Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) [2] showed the second best dividend yield as of market close on September 4. A single conglomerate placed third, Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT ) [3], per both ranking schemes. Slots four to six showed different firms in each ranking system. Another basic materials outfit was fourth, per both IndexArb and Yahoo: Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM ) [4]. The lone industrial goods firm took fifth place per IndexArb and sixth place per Yahoo: General Electric (NYSE: GE ) [5] [6]. The fifth place per Yahoo was occupied by a consumer goods concern, which placed sixth per IndexArb: Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG ) [5] [6]. A lone healthcare dog placed seventh per IndexArb, while Yahoo had it placed ninth: Pfizer (NYSE: PFE ) [7] [9]. Slot eight in the IndexArb scheme and slot seven per Yahoo was held by International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM ) [7] [8]. A single services firm placed ninth on the IndexArb list and eighth for Yahoo: McDonald's Corp. (NYSE: MCD ) [8] [9]. A second healthcare firm, Merck & Co. [10], ranked tenth per Yahoo, while IndexArb put another consumer goods firm, Coca Cola Co. (NYSE: KO ) [10], in that slot to complete the dual September IndexArb/Yahoo top ten Dow dividend dog lists. Relative strength by yield for the top ten Dow industrial index stocks was graphed below. Ten periods of historic projected annual dividend history from $10,000 invested as $1k in each of the ten highest-yielding stocks and the total single share price of those ten stocks created the data points for each period shown in blue for dividend and green for price. Actionable Conclusions: Dow Top Dogs Retreated Bearishly Into September per (1) IndexArb and (2) Yahoo Dow dogs retreated as the projected annual dividend from $10k invested as $1K in each of the top ten increased nearly 6.3% since August. At the same time, the aggregate single share price fell 5.3% to confirm the bearish retreating signal. Yahoo also projected a retreating scenario for the Dow dogs, showing 7% higher annual dividend from $10k invested as $1K in each of the top ten, while the aggregate single share price for the ten dropped 6.4% between August 6 and September 4. The differences between the IndexArb and Yahoo chart peaks and valleys over time have been caused by the variable movement of high-priced stocks with large dividends in and out of the top ten. For example, in the last period, the share price and annual dividends for E.I. du Pont (NYSE: DD ) at nearly $55/$2 pushed the price and dividend higher on Yahoo. Left with Pfizer Inc. at $35/$1 on the IndexArb list, their results were driven into retreat by Pfizer's lower price and dividend, while Yahoo price and dividends mixed up. The Dow dogs' overbought condition (in which the aggregate single share price of the ten exceeded the projected annual dividend from $1k invested in each of the ten) shrank on both the IndexArb chart and Yahoo Finance's graph. However, the gap is wider on the Yahoo graph. The September gap was estimated at $248, or 59%, on IndexArb, but $273, or 67%, per Yahoo Finance. This gap between high share price and low dividend per $1k invested shows an overbought condition. Meaning, no matter which chart you read, these are low-risk and low-opportunity Dow dogs. Until the Dow dividend from $10k invested as $1k in each of the top ten stocks exceeds the aggregate single share price of those stocks, market pressure will be on the Dow to shrink the gap.
