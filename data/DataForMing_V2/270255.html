ETF Hub Dec 20 2015, 18:21 ET | About: Facebook (FB) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor Not surprisingly, a Nielsen study on the most popular 2015 U.S. smartphone apps found the core Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) app to be #1, with an estimated 126.7M average monthly unique users (+8% Y/Y). Facebook Messenger was #3 (96.4M users, +31%), and Instagram #8 (55.4M, +23%). YouTube ( GOOG , GOOGL ), was #2 with 97.6M users (+5%). Google Search was #4 (95.4M, +3%), Google Play #5 (89.7M, +7%), Google Maps #6 (87.8M, +8%), and Gmail #7 (75.1M, +4%). Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) had the last two spots in the top-10, via its Music app (54.6M users, +26%) and Apple Maps (46.4M, +16%). Nielsen estimates 52.6% of U.S. smartphone users are on Android, and 42.7% using an iPhone. Smartphone penetration (as a % of mobile subscribers) is pegged at 80% as of September, up just slightly from 78% at the end of 2014. Though now claiming less than 1/6 of the world's ~1.8B smartphone users , the U.S. remains disproportionately important from a digital advertising standpoint. Facebook received 50% of its Q3 revenue from North America; Google/Alphabet received 47% of its Q3 revenue from the U.S.. Apple's music app (now called Apple Music) is in the top-10. Features the Apple Music service, but also the music player, iTunes Radio, etc. aapl is in the top 10 because of the iPhone and nothing else...the I followers would buy anything built in and that's why aapl maps also make the list....FB did not need an OS or hardware to take the 1st place. stop reading the news litteraly and start reading between the lines. give it another year or 2 when AR/VR hits the street and the iPhone will be as good as a BlackBerry! Just to spell it out, the Apple Music service isn't the same as the Apple Music app. A lot of people (I'm one of them) use the Music app to play music from their library or listen to iTunes Radio without subscribing to the Apple Music service. Nielsen's figure covers total smartphone users of the Music app (8 years old now and rarely if ever referred to as a flop), rather than users of the Apple Music service (called by some a flop, though I don't think it really is). Do the math Apple has 47% Smartphone users flop or not will get it installed with some captured usage. Same with Apple maps. Safari defaults to Apple maps in many instances. I don't thing the Apple Music mentioned here is just the built in iPod-like music player. This must be referring to the new Spotify competitor. Why do I believe this? 1. The iPod-style music player is in every single iPhone, and always has been. If that is what was being counted, it would have been in the top app ranking since the inception of the iPhone. Has this been the case? 2. The music player does not require Internet service to work, nor does it stream or support ads. Including the music player as a separate entity from the streaming service in this ranking doesn't make sense. 3. The music player and streaming service are fully integrated. Is it even possible to count them separately? 4. The Apple Music app grew 26% YoY. Has the percentage of iDevice users grown 26% as well? If not, that would indicate that the streaming service is pulling in new users. 5. Although purely anecdotal, my Facebook feed has increasingly featured positive comments referring to Apple Music. It seems to be gaining traction. If you stream music from iTunes either via iTunes Match or purchased music in iCloud, you need an Internet connection. That has nothing to do with Apple Music.
