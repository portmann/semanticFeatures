Disney up 3% now after blockbuster rollout from 'Jungle Book' - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Apr 18 2016, 14:43 ET | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Disney (NYSE: DIS ) stock is still riding high today, +3%, after a triumph at the weekend box office with a reimagining of The Jungle Book. The film crested $103M to easy surpass another debut, Barbershop: The Next Cut ( TWX +1.1%), which took the No. 2 spot with $20.2M. The Jungle Book (which opened slightly ahead overseas) added $189.9M in a foreign take to make an impressive worldwide total of $293.5M. Earlier, Pivotal Research upgraded Disney to Buy and gave a 17% boost to its price target for the stock. The success of Warner's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is still front-loaded, as that film fell off another 61% in its fourth week to $9M and the No. 4 spot. It's earned $311.3M domestically and $829.3M worldwide, however. As for Universal ( CMCSA +1%), a heavily watched studio after its dominant 2015, The Boss slid 57% in its second week to finish third with $10.2M. It's a big drop for a Melissa McCarthy film, but for a film that's been plagued by poor reviews. I'd buy now!  DIS will hit $150 or higher in the next 10yrs.  With ownership of MARVEL, Star Wars, and the new DIS parks opening globally, its share price is ready to take off!  Good luck! my crystal ball only goes out 9 years.  Buy now and hold for 9 years and then decide about year 10 Long DIS and ready for the stock price to reflect the quality of the company, which it does not currently. Stars Wars success already built into share price when released. Jungle Book's success was not. DIS has had a lot of film success lately, and the pipeline looks very solid (including Rogue One this year). Also, DIS making moves to counter ESPN losses. Whether successful or not remains to be seen, but they are not laying idle. Reminds me of Cheech & Chong's "Aint' that a Peach" gag in Next Movie. Chong's screw-up rendition is hilarious (the one thing from those guys that stuck with me for decades). YouTube it. I thought it was supposed to be over for Disney. You know the millennials are too busy rock climbing, riding bikes and drinking craft beers to watch sports or go to movies...
