GM Hits The Brakes In China, Should You Worry? - General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) | Seeking Alpha China is GM’s largest end market in terms of sales, which is why a slowdown in the country hurt its sales in August. GM, however, is taking the right steps to weather the downturn in China by following a three-pronged approach to sell more vehicles by targeting the premium, budget and SUV segments. GM has released a high-margin SUV in the form of the Buick Envision in China, while the Baojun brand will allow it to tap the cost-conscious customer. GM’s focus on the Cadillac brand in China is another smart move as the luxury market in the country is slated to outpace the overall car market’s growth. General Motors (NYSE: GM ) has a huge stake in China. It is second only to Volkswagen ( OTCQX:VLKAY ) in terms of sales volumes across the country, and sells more vehicles in the country than anywhere else in the world, including the U.S. This means that China is GM's biggest end market. Together with its partners, the company has sold a record 2,197,192 vehicles in China during the first eight months of this year. This is 2.3% higher than the same period last year. But, more recently, the Chinese economy has hit a roadblock due to a variety of factors ranging from the stock market crash in the country to slowing economic growth. As a result, if we take a closer look at General Motors' recent monthly performance in China, it becomes evident that the company is facing problems in the country. In the month of August , GM's sales in China declined 4.8% to 248,815 vehicles owing to softness in the overall vehicle market in the country. However, GM has taken certain steps that have helped it deliver positive growth in the first eight months of 2015, while rival Ford has reported that it has sold 1% less vehicles in China in the first 8 months this year. Amid all the challenges GM is facing in the much coveted China market, the company has remained focused on designing specific products to cater to the needs of its Chinese customers. The new SUV, Buick Envision, has been a big hit for GM in China. GM reports that Buick has had its best sales ever in China in the first eight months of the year. The brand's sales increased 5.4% year-over-year to 581,544 units. Though Envision's contribution to the brand was not huge (57,000 units in the first half), but it is growing now and this is good news for GM. The increasing share of Buick Envision in the brand's total sales is also financially beneficial for GM. The Envision is priced in the range of RMB 269,900 (about $43,450) to RMB 340,000 (about $54,700). An almost similar upcoming version of the Chevrolet Equinox will sell for around $26,000 in the U.S. Thus, the Envision commands a premium in the Chinese market, which is why it will positively impact the company's margin performance due to a higher sale price. This is probably the reason why GM has kept its profit margin goal intact for the year. GM China President Matt Tsien said in a press release , "Recently launched models such as the Buick Excelle GT and Cadillac ATS-L have been well received by consumers and produced solid sales growth." The success of the luxury brand Cadillac is also a welcome sign for GM. Even as overall sales of the company don't rise for some time, Cadillac's rise will boost profits. Cadillac's sales have come in at 49,186 units, 12% higher on a year-over-year basis through August. Going forward, it won't be surprising if Cadillac's sales continue increasing as the luxury segment in China is slated to grow despite the downturn, clocking a CAGR of 12% until 2020. Moreover, apart from the highly profitable segments of large SUVs and luxury cars, GM is also targeting the Chinese middle class population. This is not surprising as local Chinese car makers are thriving on this particular segment. In fact, the sales of the locally-made inexpensive SUVs are also on the rise in China. To keep its market share intact, GM has launched two very affordable Baojun SUVs. The Baojun 560 is smaller in size and is priced at RMB 76,800 ($12,000). It has been on the market for the past few weeks and has performed well all this while. In fact, for the January to August period, the Baojun brand's sales have jumped 282.5% to an all-time high of 223,367 units. However, GM will face stiff competition from American rival Ford in the SUV segment in China. Ford has lined up 3 new SUVs for China under the Edge and Everest nameplates. Ford already sells the EcoSport, Kuga, and Explorer SUVs in China, and could provide stiff competition to GM in China as much as it does in the U.S. Like GM, Ford is also not leaving the budget and the premium segments aside with the recently launched Escort and Taurus models, respectively. In fact, on the back of its SUV line-up, Ford has been able to arrest its sales decline from 6% in July to 3.3% in August. The fact that GM has kept its profit forecast for the year intact despite the weakness in its biggest market is commendable. The company is targeting key growth areas such as SUVs, budget SUVs, and luxury cars in order to keep its margins in good shape despite weakness in the Chinese auto market. Hence, investors can expect GM to overcome the challenges that it is facing in China successfully due to the reasons discussed above.
