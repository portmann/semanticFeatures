Apple: Can Weaker Dollar Save Its Quarter? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Fiscal Q1 saw a roughly $5 billion revenue hit due to currencies. The US dollar tumbled thanks to Fed rate hike caution. When Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) management discussed its fiscal Q1 results in January, CEO Tim Cook provided the following statement on the conference call : The 8% growth rate I spoke about earlier translates to $80.8 billion in constant currency revenue, which is $5 billion more than our reported revenue. For perspective, that difference is about the size of the annual revenue of a Fortune 500 company. With about two-thirds of the company's revenues generated outside the US, currency movements are extremely important to Apple's reported results. In fact, the company provided the following chart to show how much the dollar's rally had eaten into results: For the March ending Q2 that will be reported next week, Apple management stated there would be a 400 basis-point hit to revenues thanks currency movements. Based on the $50 billion to $53 billion guidance range, that's at least a $2 billion negative impact to revenues for the quarter. The previous earnings report was on January 26th, and since then, the Federal Reserve has been a little softer on its interest rate hike plan for this year. As a result, we've seen the US dollar weaken a bit against many key currencies. Below, I've detailed the changes in some currency pairs from the earnings call date (Jan. 26th) to the end of fiscal Q2 (Mar. 26th), per CNBC.com data: Japanese Yen strengthened from 118.425 to 113.07. Canadian Dollar strengthened from 1.412 to 1.328. Brazilian Real strengthened from 4.054 to 3.684. We also saw the Euro strengthen by about 3%, and the Australian dollar by about 7%. Remember, Apple's reported results for Q2 will be based on comparisons to these currencies from the year-ago period, but the weakening of the dollar will be a tailwind to results. The trade weighted dollar, according to the St. Louis Fed , weakened by about 4% over the above detailed two-month time period. With some currencies strengthening more than that, but Apple's US results not playing a part, let's assume that the company sees a tailwind of half that amount, 2%, or 200 basis points. Even at the low end of the company's guidance, 200 basis points represents $1 billion in quarterly revenues. A tailwind of that size would be very pleasant, given concerns over weak iPhone sales. Currently, Apple analysts are at $52.00 billion for the quarter, half a billion dollars above the midpoint. On Estimize , forecasts are even stronger, with the average approaching $52.5 billion. Thus, you can see how a billion dollar boost from currencies could go a long way to Apple meeting consensus results. With all of the talk out there regarding weak iPhone sales, the company's quarter may be salvageable thanks to a weaker US dollar. The greenback pulled back against many key currencies after management gave guidance, which could provide a tailwind that tops $1 billion for reported revenues. Apple can use any help it gets here, given analysts are above the company's midpoint and estimates on Estimize are even higher.
