Micron's Many (Indirect) Relationships With Tsinghua - Micron Technology Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) | Seeking Alpha A Tsinghua Unigroup-Micron merger is even less likely, now than it was during the summer. While still unlikely, a Tsinghua Unigroup-Micron joint venture is becoming more viable. Tsinghua Unigroup and Unisplendour are operating subsidiaries of Tsinghua Holdings. Intel is a shareholder of Tsinghua Unigroup. Unisplendour is allies with HP, Western Digital and SanDisk. Unigroup is allied with Intel and Powertech. Unisplendour and Unigroup are investing in companies that are competitors of each other. The era of big investments from China in semiconductors is just beginning. The 1 trillion renminbi investment in the semiconductor industry over the next 5-10 years is not hyperbole. In July 2015, rumors of Tsinghua Unigroup making a $23 billion bid for Micron (NASDAQ: MU ) surfaced. Before this bid, many Micron shareholders (and Americans in general) probably have never heard of Tsinghua Unigroup. In 2014, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) purchased a 20% stake in Tsinghua Unigroup, an operating subsidiary of Tsinghua Holdings. Tsinghua Holdings is a limited liability corporation funded by Tsinghua University, an elite research university located in Beijing. To those who are not familiar with universities in Asia, an accurate description of the prestige of Tsinghua in China is similar to that of MIT or CalTech in the U.S. Tsinghua is close to universally regarded as the top school for engineering, mathematics and the sciences in China. I attended a graduate course in random signal analysis at a renowned American university that was filled with many graduates of Tsinghua. Suffice it to say, I was very impressed with the mathematical aptitude of this set of Chinese students. Tsinghua Holdings has many operating subsidiaries. Along with Tsinghua Unigroup, the Tsinghua Tongfang Company and Unisplendour are the most well-known operating subsidiaries of Tsinghua Holdings. Unisplendour has made headlines in the US this year with its acquisition of a majority stake in Hewlett-Packard's (NYSE: HPQ ) Chinese server, storage and technology assets. Unisplendour also agreed to buy a 15% stake in HDD (hard disk drive) manufacturer Western Digital (NASDAQ: WDC ) for $3.78 billion. Within weeks, Western Digital announced a deal to acquire NAND flash manufacturer SanDisk (NASDAQ: SNDK ) for $19 billion (in mostly cash). Tsinghua Holdings (via its operating subsidiaries) is quickly amassing a large portfolio of semiconductor and technology assets. Tsinghua Unigroup acquired (WSJ link, requires subscription) a 25% stake in Powertech Technology for $600 million in October 2015. Powertech is one of the leading chip packaging and testing companies in Taiwan. The IC backend supplier PowerTech, along with Micron, announced in December 2014 that the two companies would form an over $200 million joint venture to build a facility in Xian, China to perform assembly and packaging services for Micron's memory chips. Micron should be able to realize some additional incremental gross margin by reducing the amount it spends on outsourcing backend services. Through its Powertech stake, Tsinghua Unigroup will indirectly benefit from the success of Micron (and the DRAM industry in general). Intel ( INTC ) has a strategic alliance with Tsinghua Unigroup (as well as a 20% ownership stake that it acquired for $1.5 billion). Tsinghua Unigroup announced its acquisition of Spreadtrum in 2013 and also unveiled its acquisition of RDA Microelectronics in 2014. Intel hopes its alliance with Tsinghua Unigroup will allow the American semiconductor giant to jointly develop Intel-based chips for mobile phones (both for the Chinese market and other markets) with its Chinese ally. Tsinghua Chairman Zhao Weiguo has called the development of a semiconductor industry in China a "national priority." Intel has struggled to gain a foothold in the mobile SoC business and has been bleeding billions of dollars over the last few years in an attempt to create a viable mobile chip business. Establishing a strong Chinese customer base could be the key to Intel's mobile chip dreams and Intel's decades of experience and top quality engineering talent could be instrumental to the development of Tsinghua and China's semiconductor endeavors. Intel's partnership with Micron has been fruitful over the last several years. Through its joint venture, the two American semiconductor companies are producing planar NAND flash currently. The two partners have developed a high density 3D NAND product that will likely be the lowest cost NAND solution in the market in 2016. These two have also developed 3D XPoint, a non-volatile memory with incredible performance characteristics that has the potential to fundamentally change the memory hierarchy of electronic devices. Intel has stated that it will roll out 3D XPoint based SSDs (Solid-State Drives) in 2016. I initially speculated that 3D XPoint would displace some DRAM demand as XPoint's non-volatile nature and (likely) lower cost make it a better choice than DRAM in many IMDB applications. While there are a lot of unknowns about this next generation NVM, it seems highly likely that Intel and Micron are planning for 3D XPoint to become the eventual successor to 3D NAND. (It probably is a bit early to start anointing a successor to a technology that Micron and Intel are still at least several months away from producing in high volumes.) Tsinghua Unigroup has a relationship with Intel through Intel's stake (and alliance) with the rapidly growing Chinese semiconductor firm. Intel and Micron have operated a successful joint venture together for years. Tsinghua Unigroup and Micron have a mutual ally in Intel. Micron has a large joint venture with Powertech and Tsinghua Unigroup has now become a large shareholder of the Taiwanese backend services company. Tsinghua Unigroup and Micron also have a mutual ally in Powertech. Tsinghua Unigroup has hired Charles Kau, Chairman of Inotera and President of Nanya. Could the hiring of Kau signal Tsinghua Unigroup's desire to pursue Micron or one of its smaller Taiwanese memory affiliates (Nanya and Inotera)? Because of Micron's large stake in Inotera (and business arrangement), it seems more likely that Tsinghua could target an acquisition of Nanya, the second largest shareholder of Inotera behind Micron. While Tsinghua Unigroup may desire an acquisition of Nanya, it seems more likely that the Taiwanese memory manufacturer will find itself under Micron's umbrella via an acquisition. I think we all know that Tsinghua Unigroup has its eye on a much bigger prize (Micron). Tsinghua Unigroup has developed strong ties with companies that have joint ventures with Micron. However, Tsinghua Unigroup's affiliated company Unisplendour (which is also an operating subsidiary of Tsinghua Holdings) has made investments in companies that are in competition with Tsinghua Unigroup's investments. Unisplendour has agreed to invest $3.78 billion for a 15% stake in Western Digital, one of the two dominant HDD manufacturers left standing. Western Digital then agreed to a deal to acquire SanDisk, the biggest pure play NAND manufacturer around. Intel (with Micron) has big plans in NAND (and other non-volatile memories) that will be in direct competition with SanDisk. On the Unisplendour side, there is Western Digital, SanDisk and HP. (SanDisk previously announced a deal with HP to develop a next generation NVM (non-volatile memory) that will have similar performance characteristics to that of Intel and Micron's 3D XPoint.) On the Unigroup side, there is Intel and Powertech. While I fully anticipate the Unisplendour-Western Digital and the Western Digital-SanDisk deals to eventually receive regulatory approval, there certainly could be a hiccup or two in the process. One of the major consequences of a Unisplendour-Western Digital-SanDisk deal is that the unlikely Tsinghua Unigroup-Micron merger will become even less likely to receive regulatory approval. On top of national security concerns and protests of famous Congressman, antitrust concerns will enter the picture if Unigroup finally makes a formal bid for Micron. That's on top of the necessity of the Chinese company to more than double its informal bid of $23 billion to give Micron shareholders a reason to hand over the reigns of the Idaho-based memory giant that has weathered so many semiconductor cycles over the decades. Intel's relationship with Tsinghua Holdings has also gotten messy over the last several weeks. Intel owns 20% of Tsinghua Unigroup and Unisplendour will be a large shareholder of Western Digital-SanDisk, an adversary of Intel in non-volatile memory. In an article I posted on this site in September titled " Micron and China's Semiconductor Dreams ," I discussed the possibility of Tsinghua Unigroup potentially acquiring Micron or forming a joint venture with Micron. At the time, I thought an acquisition of Micron had near zero probability. While a joint venture or partnership of some sort is more likely than an acquisition, I still thought a Tsinghua Unigroup-Micron partnership as unlikely. However, there's been a lot of activity in the industry over the last 5 or 6 weeks. It is abundantly clear that not only is China committed to investing up to a trillion renminbi (~$157 billion) in the semiconductor industry over the next 5-10 years, but it is willing to make big moves as soon as possible. The acquisition of 25% of Powertech by Tsinghua Unigroup could be a mere "value investment" and poaching Charles Kau from Inotera and Nanya could also just be acquiring one of the most successful and well-connected men in the memory industry. A Micron acquisition has almost no chance of receiving regulatory approval, but a partnership or joint venture of some sort is possible. I believe it is certainly a possibility that the recent moves by Unigroup are a precursor to Unigroup eventually partnering with Micron (and/or Intel) to build memory chips (DRAM and/or NAND) in China. While the reasons I gave for believing a Micron-Tsinghua Unigroup joint venture as being unlikely in the original article linked above are still valid, the probability of such a deal has moved up over the last 5 or 6 weeks. What does this all mean for Micron? I will discuss one possibility. Micron will acquire Nanya (and give itself two-thirds ownership of Inotera in the process). Micron may partner with Tsinghua Unigroup to build a DRAM fab (or fabs) in China. Micron then converts many of its other DRAM fabs to 3D NAND and 3D XPoint fabs. Tsinghua Unigroup not only acquires a 25% stake in Powertech, but also attempts to acquire stakes in other Taiwanese IC companies that could be of strategic importance to Micron. After the conversion of DRAM fabs into non-volatile memory fabs, Micron investors will find out how much more profitable building a 3D NAND or 3D XPoint wafer is relative to a wafer of DRAM. Estimates will vary tremendously right now, but I strongly suspect the profitability of Micron per wafer will be multiples higher for 3D NAND and XPoint relative to DRAM. While I am discussing the (possibly way overly) ultra bullish thesis, I will throw out one other fun note about Intel. Some Micron investors panicked and sold Micron shares upon news of Intel converting one of its Chinese fabs into a fab dedicated to building 3D NAND. This Intel fab story was a possibility that Kipp Bedard of Micron mentioned at a Raymond James conference in September. Bedard stated that Intel may build 3D NAND (and XPoint) capacity on its own because demand for these products may be so high that Micron and Intel's current joint production efforts (along with Micron's independent production efforts in Singapore) are nowhere close to enough to fill the incredible number of orders that are predicted to come. There are three possible reasons why Intel seems to be pushing the industry into what most analysts seem to think is a likely oversupply of NAND: Intel believes Wall Street estimates are clueless and just way off. The semiconductor giant may have internal estimates of NAND demand that is far greater than what the rest of the market sees right now. This is a corollary to reason number 1. Intel believes the SSD revolution is coming sooner than what most of the market believes. Intel believes SSDs is about to significantly eat into the market share that was previously held by HDDs. Intel believes that the joint development efforts with Micron that have led to 3D NAND and 3D XPoint (and potentially other memories in the pipelines) are going to be more revolutionary than the market currently believes. Intel (and Micron) may believe they have a 3D NAND and next generation NVM solution that is not just incrementally better than that of its competition. The solutions are so good and will scale in a way that makes the 3D NAND (and next-generation NVM) solutions of its competitors no longer economically viable. Intel (with Micron) is looking at the possibility of a huge market share grab and putting a competitor or two to sleep. The possibility number 3 would be great for Intel and Micron longs, but that one is extremely unlikely (from my perspective). Possibility number 2 is more likely and possibility number 1 is the most likely. A Tsinghua Unigroup-Micron merger is not going to happen, but Unigroup could certainly end up being a strong ally for Micron going forward. That possibility is starting to look more likely with every new deal Unigroup is making. I remain long Micron and I strongly suspect I will remain long Micron through 2016 and 2017 (and possibly far beyond.) We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
