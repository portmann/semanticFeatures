The Best Amazon Coupons and Deals  - The Simple Dollar By Catherine Alford Last updated March 11, 2015 If youâ€™re anything like me, you spend a lot of time searching for the best deals on Amazon and scouring Amazon coupons. After all, with young kids and the piles and piles of snow outside, Itâ€™s much easier to hop on the computer to shop for great deals. However, when it comes to shopping online and getting great prices, many people have questioned whether you really can find the best deals on Amazon and if Amazon coupons are really better than combing your local stores for deals. While some people think you pay a premium for shopping online for the convenience of it all, Iâ€™ve actually found that with a little bit of searching, you can find some awesome prices. Amazon Coupons This is a great way to get an extra discount on products you are already using. There are coupons for individual items and also ways to save even more through subscribe and save, a service that automatically sends items you buy all the time right to your door. Amazon Warehouse This section of Amazon is any bargain hunterâ€™s dream. It sells open box items and used items too. They have just about any product you can dream of on there, and as long as you donâ€™t mind it being slightly used or out of the box, you can score big here. Amazon Gold Box This is Amazonâ€™s version of a flash sale website. They offer deals on certain items up to a particular date. Iâ€™ve seen incredible discounts on computer software, clothes, and watches all in the past few days. Amazon Prime On the face of it, Prime seems like an added cost, however very few people use it to its full potential. With Prime, which costs $99 a year, you get free 2-day shipping. Itâ€™s not that hard for me to figure out that $99 is less than my full year of shipping costs, so this is a no-brainer for me. The added benefits lower marginal costs of other activities to near zero. You get access to great streaming music, Kindle books, and Prime instant video all for the cost of your Prime membership. If you have a new baby, youâ€™ve probably Googled things like “How can I get my baby to sleep more at night?” Donâ€™t worry; youâ€™re definitely not the only sleep deprived parent who went searching for a solution! I know that when my kids were little, swaddles and sleep sacks did wonders for them. I was actually so sad when they outgrew them because without them, they started pulling up on the sides of their cribs and talking to each other at all hours of the night (I have twins.) Yep, thereâ€™s something just so sweet an innocent about a baby all cozy for bed. Unfortunately swaddles and sleep sacks can get rather expensive, so when I saw this deal for 45% off a cream colored sleep sack, I had to share: What can you do with the $12.60 you saved? Well, you can treat yourself to a nice pound of coffee and make a ton of it at home because God knows you need it! Iâ€™m definitely not one to buy name brand clothes for my children off the rack since you and I both know those kids grow like crazy. However, when I find a nice outfit for them that would look great in pictures, I try to wait for it to go on sale. Again, thereâ€™s just no point in paying full price for something theyâ€™ll only wear once. I squealed a little bit when I saw this outfit for a little boy. At nearly 60% off (with fake sunglasses included no less!) itâ€™s hard to pass up. Plus, with the $29.50 you saved you could pick up a great childrenâ€™s books, like Brown Bear, Brown Bear (my sonâ€™s favorite) or add some money to your childâ€™s college fund . Yep, Iâ€™m bringing up coffee again. What can I say; the stuff is addictive. My husband, who used to be a barista at Starbucks for many years, says the best way to drink coffee is to grind the beans yourself. Heâ€™s very fancy about the whole thing, so you should take his word on it. This coffee grinder is a great deal. Itâ€™s a well known brand, Cuisinart, and itâ€™s 45% off. Score. And hey, with the $40 you saved, you could stock up on a few of these stainless steel coffee cups worthy of James Bond . *Price available for “Gunmetal” color option I am so tired of going through earphones right and left. I use them all the time because I tend to write in coffee shops, but inevitably one goes missing or comes apart. Iâ€™ve been wanting a pair of nicer headphones for a while, but I just couldnâ€™t justify the expense. However, when they come at 70% off, thatâ€™s why we can say youâ€™ll find the best deals on Amazon! Luckily for you, with the $70 you saved, you could pic up Taylor Swiftâ€™s new album and shake it off while you walk down the street wearing your new headphones. OR – You could just pocket the savings! If you want to know how I found such great deals, the process is really simple. While I love using Amazon Gold Box , Amazon Warehouse , and Amazon Coupons , many of those deals have quick expiration dates. The way I find deals that are longer lasting (so I have time to think about the purchase and save for it) is through something called Jungle Search. Hereâ€™s how it works. 3. Adjust the settings to only show items that are 35%-70% off with an average rating of 4+ stars. 4. Click the button that says “Click for savings” which will take you directly to the Amazon website. The reason I like this method is because: 1. All the deals we share with you are more than 35% off, which we consider awesome. 2. The products are high quality, because I only choose ones that have 4+ stars and several reviews. 3. Everything I list I would buy myself, and hey, Iâ€™ve been known to have good taste from time to time. So, next time you think about going to the mall to buy something, instead start researching deals on Amazon, whether you use one of their deal sites or Amazon coupons. As evidenced above, you can find great products this way, all up to 70% off. I donâ€™t know about you but Iâ€™d pick shopping in my pajamas online any day over going out in that snow.
