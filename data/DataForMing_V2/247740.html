ETF Hub Nov 25 2015, 19:23 ET | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Wells Fargo has picked its winners in March's FCC broadcast incentive auction for wireless spectrum -- and it figures AT&T ( T +0.2%) will dominate bidding that should total $30B-$35B. Analysts at the bank predict up to $10B spending coming from the telecom giant for a nationwide block of 2x10 MHz airwaves. T-Mobile ( TMUS -3.7%) -- which has been signaling aggressive moves in the auction -- will be second, with $8B spent, the analysts said, while Verizon ( VZ -0.6%) should be last with $5B in bids. Sprint ( S -1.8%) has already said it's sitting this one out. While AT&T backtracked a bit on pledges to spend $9B while it was digesting DirecTV (NASDAQ: DTV ), the analysts think the benefits of a nationwide block may signal higher spending from the company. Verizon, meanwhile, has credit to spend up to $10B, but probably won't: "Similar to what T has said publicly and based on our conversations with spectrum experts, we look for VZ to contribute in a meaningful way if 2x10MHz bands are made available." Previously: T-Mobile -2.2% as it pledges $200 for each Sprint line that switches (Nov. 25 2015) Sprint hasn't ever put their spectrum to work, the "spectrum advantage" has been a lie a decade long.  The worst ARPU, has both Masa and Arora wanting to sell and stuck with a terrible position. But please, remind us of your calls of massive buybacks, dividends, and double digit share prices.  All of which, obviously, were dead wrong. I think that T will be the big winter in all of this think , they & DirectTV will give us a good size Dividend in December 31, 2015 I think this is another reason, besides reducing debt, that the dividend should stay a 1 cent one more year.  Still an increase, and let's let T grow a little more. Bug eyes legere talking down the stock instead of fixing metropcs by offering top tier phones at or near cost not the garbage they sell now. Wake up John stop giving away the gold and start fixing the butter. One trick pony.
