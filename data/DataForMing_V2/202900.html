Intel Silicon Photonics: A More In-Depth Explanation - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Silicon Photonics are uniquely disruptive to data center connectivity as it reduces the amount of switches and improves data transfer rates. Intel is uniquely positioned to corner this market as competing alternative are non-existent and less economical. The interconnect modules utilizes Intel's fab, which will boost utilization rates, thus improving gross margin. However, each incremental unit of operating profit will be met with higher taxes as the tax rate is deflated due to subsidies and tax deferment strategies. The incremental impact on revenue is projected to be $3 billion with some room for upside depending on attach rate and demand for servers. Readers have been asking me about Intel Silicon Photonics ever since the topic was first brought up at last year's analyst day. Thankfully, we have more details and information pertinent to that topic following Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) Data Center Day, which I will be covering in more detail throughout the course of this article. The first thing to understand is that today's data centers are substantially larger. Some data centers reach up to 750,000 square feet of gross leasable area. To put that figure in context, think back to the last time you went to a mega mall, but instead of filling the shopping mall full of retail outlets, you have servers stacked up on top of each other in racks. That's a lot of servers. Some data centers have over 100,000 rack-mount servers, which speaks to the scale of today's network infrastructure. For the server to communicate instructions, the information has to be transmitted between servers, which go through switches, which are referred to as leafs or spines. The more data is communicated between these switches, the longer it takes to transmit data. At the low level you have leafs, mid-level refers to spines, and then at the top is a core computer that communicates with other data centers or directly to the client (it really varies depending on the complexity of the data center design). Not so surprisingly, these computers are connected via short reach optics, with in-rack connections being managed via copper wire. Intel doesn't anticipate Silicon Photonics to displace demand for copper, but it does anticipate Silicon Photonics to displace demand for short reach optics, which are referred to as VCSELs. Silicon Photonics reduces the number of switches that occurs when transmitting information, which drastically improves the performance and scale of data centers. The high-density arrays have up to 2 kilometers of reach, so it gives companies the ability to scale the size and improve the design of data centers as well. Not so surprisingly, Silicon Photonics have better data transfer rates, which can go up to 25 GB/s with the current generation and are expected to scale up to 50 Gb/s in the second generation. The speeds are expected to reach 100 Gb/s in later generation models, which will accommodate for faster Internet connectivity, i.e. 5G speeds and gigabit Internet. The optical interconnects are made with silicon chips (mass producible) and have lasers that transmit via parallel WDM arrays. The product can be produced at scale, which is why the economics of scaling production works well with Intel's business model. The opportunity for across data center connectivity is estimated to be $3 billion in terms of revenue. Furthermore, the optical modules will use Intel's in-house fab, which have enough left over capacity for additional wafer volumes pertaining to Silicon Photonics. In other words, gross margins could improve just through increased utilization as wafers are relatively inexpensive when compared to the cost of amortizing plant assets. That being the case, the data center group is projected to generate $16.2 billion in revenue in FY 2015, assuming the 15% CAGR is sustained. The incremental $3 billion in revenue does move the needle in terms of revenue, as it's large enough to boost revenue assumptions by 20%. Of course, there are some factors that could challenge growth assumptions. While Silicon Photonics is a great product for data centers, not all data centers need cutting edge data transfer speeds. Some legacy data centers won't move to the new technology while adoption into pre-existing data centers could be slower than anticipated. In the past five years profit margins have remained relatively stable. In some cases, earnings will beat due to tax-related gains, but we all know that if earnings grow, the tax rate will also increase, as tax rebates will only reduce taxes by so much. So each incremental dollar of revenue from these new categories won't be offset by as many tax credits, which is why the profit margin could be impacted by a couple hundred basis points. Currently, Intel's tax rate is around 27%, if that figure moves up to 30% the impact on net income will be material. However, forecasting this impact is somewhat difficult as there's not enough visibility into Intel's taxes to make an accurate judgment on what the exact tax rate will be in five years time. However, investors should anticipate these additional business units to have a positive gross margin impact, but net profit margins could be dragged down a little due to tax-related reasons. As I have mentioned earlier, it's difficult to anticipate the attach rate for network interconnects, but the impact on revenues will start to surface in 2016. I continue to reiterate my hold recommendation and $31 price target. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
