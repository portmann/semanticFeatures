Netflix Q1 2015 Preview: Deja Vu Anyone? - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha NFLX will report 1Q15 on Wednesday after market close. Subs growth is expected to beat given the ongoing cord-shaving trend in the U.S. Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) will report its 1Q15 earnings on Wednesday after market close. Investors who wish to listen to the conference call can find it on the IR site . Having gone up 39% YTD, the stock is priced for perfection after surprising the market with better-than-expected subscriber metrics. Heading into earnings, investors will once again focus on subs growth with the U.S. benefiting from the continued cord shaving/cutting trend and international benefiting from new market rollout. Management expects +1.8m domestic adds and +2.25m international adds, a target which I consider achievable due to the expected acceleration of cord shaving this year as low-cost cable bundles hit the market. I believe NFLX will become an essential add-on to these bundles as it penetrates deeper into the 100m cable TV households in the U.S. Beneficiary of the cord shaving trend NFLX remains well-positioned to benefit from the cord-shaving trend as millennials scale back on their cable subscriptions in favor of a slimmed down TV package with the NFLX add-on. The company's 4Q14 subs that were all above management guidance suggests additional room for upside as the cord-shaving trend accelerates due to the proliferation of web-TV products. In my view, NFLX differentiates from the competing web-TVs in terms of its original programming so I do not see near-term risk to the NFLX subs number even with additional OTT products coming onto the market. The next key focus for NFLX will be on big picture movies that draw viewers away from traditional content distributors (i.e. cable companies and movie theaters). The success of the sequel to Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon will be a major catalyst for NFLX, in my view. A key question is whether NFLX will enter China, which could further expand its addressable market. I believe NFLX will have a good shot at taking the Middle Kingdom after Deadline reported that NFLX could potentially enter a partnership with LeTV (see: Netflix: Taking Middle Kingdom With LeTV ). This partnership has the ability to allow NFLX to obtain the relevant licensing for web and mobile distribution of digital content in China. It's worth remembering that content distribution is a sensitive subject matter in China and a local partner is necessary for a successful entry. I will be looking for clues to whether this partnership may materialize in the medium term. I would be buyer of NFLX ahead of Wednesday's results. The company remains the key beneficiary of the cord-shaving trend with China providing an attractive call option. Source: Netflix Q1 2015 Preview: Deja Vu Anyone?
