Yahoo Ex-Alibaba Is Cheap - Cramer's Lightning Round (3/11/15) | Seeking Alpha Union Pacific (NYSE: UNP ): "Union Pacific is a good buy because it is down a lot and terrific." Sherwin-Williams (NYSE: SHW ): "I like Sherwin Williams, but I like PPG (NYSE: PPG ) more. With PPG you get the paint, but you also get Chuck Bunch and some fabulous materials that his company has created." Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ): "If you look at Yahoo ex-Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ), then I think it's a very cheap stock. I say buy right here and right now." Oasis Petroleum (NYSE: OAS ): "Even down here I think you are still playing with fire there. No thank you." Athenahealth (NASDAQ: ATHN ): "Athenahealth is a high-risk stock and it's been plagued by people banging it in and out. I'm going to say right now, don't buy. It's too high-risk for me."
