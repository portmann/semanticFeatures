Click to print (Opens in new window) Nearly two weeks after rumors swirled that Microsoft would replace the AC power cords for older-model Surface Pro, Surface Pro 2, and Surface Pro 3 tablets sold in the U.S. and Canada before March 2015, the Consumer Product Safety Commission officially recalled the chargers.Â  According to the CPSC , he safety measure covers 2.25 million cords that could overheat, posing fire or shock hazards. AÂ Microsoft spokesperson previously said the issue was the “result of damage caused by AC power cords being wound too tightly, twisted or pinched over an extended period of time.” The CPSCÂ and Microsoft are, so far, aware of 56 reports of cords overheating and emitting flames and five reports of electrical shock to consumers. Affected Surface Pro and Surface Pro 2 devices have a black case with the product name on the back of the device toward the bottom, while affected Surface Pro 3 computers have a silver case with â€œWindows 8 Proâ€? on the back of the device under the kickstand. The recall also applies toÂ accessory power supply units that include an AC power cord sold separately before March 15, 2015. Owners of the recalled cordsÂ should unplug and stop using them, and contact Microsoft for a free replacement AC power cord.
