Apple Tumbles To ETFlash Crash Levels, Saved (For Now) By Another Tim Cook Hail Mary Announcement | Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site!

Apple's shares broke below $100 in pre-market trading as analyst downgrades and further component producer outlook reductions weighed heavily on the "no brainer." It appears increasingly likely that Tim Cook's "rescue" email to Cramer on August was perhaps not the entire truth.. and the market is trading back to levels it first crossed in August 2014 (i.e. unchanged in 16 months). Of course, amid this carnage this morning, AAPL attempted to save the day and issued a quick statement proclaiming January 1st as the biggest App Store spending day in history... for now the stock is not excited about that. Following our reports of FoxConn's hiring freeze in November 9which was ignored by all the talking heads) , and confirming Nikkei's recent report of a 30% production cut in iPhones, this morning's headlines are not helping... However, things just do not add up the way that Tim Cook said they were... Here is what Tim Cook told Jim Cramer via email at the peak of the panic in August: "I get updates on our performance in China every day, including this morning, and I can tell you that we have continued to experience strong growth for our business in China through July and August. Growth in iPhone activations has actually accelerated over the past few weeks, and we have had the best performance of the year for the App Store in China during the last 2 weeks." As we asked at the peak of the panic in August, So did Tim Cook lie? If one uses channel check data to objectively determine end demand, the answer is a resounding yes. To be sure, Cook may be telling the truth in a very narrow sense, if Apple is simply be resorting to the oldest trick in the book at this point: channel stuffing. The problem with channel stuffing is that it only allows you to mask the problem for 2-3 quarters at which unless there has been a dramatic improvement in the end-demand picture, it re-emerges that much more acutely: just ask AOL which was channel stuffing for months on end, only to be ultimately exposed, leading to a epic plunge in the stock price. So is AAPL the next AOL, and is Tim Cook the next Thorsten Heins? It all depends on China: if the world's most populous nation can get its stock market, its economy and its currency under control, then this too shall pass. The problem is that if, as many increasingly suggest, China has lost control of all three. At that point anyone who thought they got a great deal when buying AAPL at $92 will have far better opportunities to dollar-cost average far, far lower. It appears - given the constant flow of evidence - that AAPL's Tim Cook may have some explaining to do as his channel-stuffing lioes come back to haunt him.

This time the only difference is, Steve left the company in much better shape; instead of leaving a flagship product line with 10% market share of a 2-product market, he left one with a leading market share in a highly fragmented market (and a dominant profit share). So Apple's post-Jobs decline this time around will be more gradual, but directionally, exactly the same. I really don't understand why Jobs left the fudge-packer in charge, though. The fudge-packer lifestyle is a big distraction, demanding a lot of time and energy, from an executive who already has his hands more than full; Jobs was smart enough to understand this. But fudge-packers are generally quite good at playing office politics, and my guess is Cook took advantage of Jobs' declining health to insinuate himself into his current position.

The smaller/thinner it is, the less functionality it has. Soon, you will pay $3,000 and Apple will ship you a box containing a sheet of paper, that will read: Wed, 01/06/2016 - 09:35 | 7004344 XXL66 Maybe they can make an iCar to burn some cash. If they sell the equivalent of 1 year VW production with the amount that Tesla loses for every car, the 200 billion is all gone in a single year. This is not taken inflation into account. Just kidding. Don't sell your stock. Apple could be the next Blackberry! =) Wed, 01/06/2016 - 09:37 | 7004360 Boris Badenov Wed, 01/06/2016 - 09:48 | 7004421 Bubenthauser Tyler, your hate for the only decent behemoth company in the world today is pointless. You obviously don't understand cycles on WallSt and the business of Apple Inc. But hey, you're not alone. Pathetic.  Wed, 01/06/2016 - 10:02 | 7004492 Golden Phoenix Yeah, I guess people who don't hold a declining stock are too stupid to understand. People who hold securities which are rising are such idiots. Wed, 01/06/2016 - 10:19 | 7004553 Bubenthauser No, it's the contrary. Buy low, sell high. Up to the trader's execution. All the rest is FUCKING NARRATIVES, just like the majority of the BS spewed by Tylers of late. But hey, that what journalists do. They SELL words and narratives. Usually witha fucking BIAS. Wed, 01/06/2016 - 10:25 | 7004576 Shibumi2 It's a tough business and Samsung is a tough competitor...but that doesn't mean Apple sucks. They (Jobs) created the whole industry and will always have a slice.  They opted for a closed architecture compared to Samsungs open model. It boils down to platform stability vs "open source"...wildly different business models. Unfortunately for Apple, Millennials hate the close platform model. It seems inevitable that Samsung will prevail...but the next insanely great thing will come from America...count on that...and some asian behemoth will end up with the market when it moves towards being a commodity. Wed, 01/06/2016 - 10:16 | 7004480 Golden Phoenix If you want to do some basic technical analysis on Aapl shares draw a long term trendline from the April 2003 low up across the previous bottoms. You'll see Aapl's price recently penetrated that trendline to the downside, briefly turned up to test it from below, touched it, then failed and has since declined from there. This is a textbook example of what you do not want to see a stock you hold do. For those annoyed by Aapl fanboys it's a sight to behold. Fanboys will disregard this post because they like having their trendline bottoms penetrated. It's a 20-year 'generational' thing (the irony...)   Gotta go back to when it was $8/share and Bill Gates offered up some $$$ to keep the company afloat...    That could happen again ya know...   Shit goes back & forth. Wed, 01/06/2016 - 12:38 | 7005434 Bastille Day Forbes 30 Under 30: Young energy entrepreneurs to watch, including a few Texans Posted on January 5, 2016 | By  Joshua Cain Forbes Magazineâ€™s latest list of entrepreneurs under 30 includes a few Texans among those to watch bringing changes to the energy industry. The magazine is honoring 600 total individuals across 20 different lists of industries for its fifth annual â€œ30 Under 30â€? list. Of the 30 entrepreneurs who made the list for energy, just five are developing solutions for the oil and gas industry. Among them, two are focused on helping drilling engineers improve subsurface operations. The founders of NUD Geochemical, based out of Austin, have created a service that uses x-ray fluorescence and high-resolution scanning to determine the mineral makeup of rock layers encountered by a driller. And the founder of Tachyus developed software that helps operators determine where and how to drill. The list also includes four Texans. One, a 19-year-old from Friendswood, engineered a subsea wellhead capable of capturing oil and gas from a well blow out after watching the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico as a high school student.
