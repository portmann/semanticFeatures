Market Has A Lot Of Negativity - Cramer's Mad Money (10/26/15) | Seeking Alpha Oct. 27, 2015  7:43 AM ET  |  Includes: ADBE , AMGN , BIIB , CELG , DPZ , GILD , IDTI , JACK , JCP , MCD , MSFT , MU , ORCL , PLKI , RLYP , SIG , TIF , VTR by: SA Editor Mohit Manghnani There is a lot of negativity in the market for anyone to believe about change and turnarounds. Cramer keeps talking about a change in McDonald's (NYSE: MCD ) but no one believes him. "I think that CEO Steve Easterbrook knows that if he can somehow get back to the basics of the value meal that tastes good with some chicken and biscuits thrown in, he can get that engine to hum," said Cramer. Domino's Pizza (NYSE: DPZ ) and Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen (NASDAQ: PLKI ) have had successful turnarounds and McDonald's can have one too. Had it been only about health, Burger King wouldn't have done well. He also thinks that Microsoft's new Fifth Avenue store could do well but no one thinks that it is cool enough. Yet all the corporates use Windows 10 and it is gaining popularity. Biotech is also in such a negative trend due to the drug pricing issue. But if one sees the PE multiples of stocks like Biogen (NASDAQ: BIIB ), Celgene (NASDAQ: CELG ), Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN ) and Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ: GILD ), they appear cheap compared to their growth prospects. Yet some companies with no revenue or drugs for immediate release are trading at hefty valuations. One has to wait for the negativity to fade away. A similar trend can be seen in defense stocks. The world is buying more arms but no one wants to be in Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT ). "Negativity can create terrific bargains every day. These stocks are just a short sample of what is out there. If you share the Wall Street groupthink, you'll miss them. If you think outside yourself, though, you'll be astonished by what you find," said Cramer. The bounce in old tech stocks is not restricted to Microsoft. Companies like Adobe have also found a way to be a popular player in the cloud and the stock is near a high. Adobe was 36% up in the last year and is up 19% in the last 2 months. The company has started selling software as a service over the cloud and was able to adapt to the new technologies quickly. Cramer thinks that Adobe does not get enough credit for transitioning its old software business into the cloud. "With Adobe hitting a brand new all-time high today, I think it's worth taking the time to figure out why this stock keeps charging higher, confounding the skeptics, while also giving you the occasional fabulous entry point courtesy of various short-lived but gigantic pullbacks," added Cramer. The analysts still remain unimpressed even though Adobe has beaten projections consistently. Microsoft trades at 20 times earnings and Oracle (NYSE: ORCL ) at 15. That way Adobe looks expensive with the PE multiple of 32, but if the company's 20% growth is taken into account, it doesn't seem expensive. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and its earnings What to do with Apple before it reports earnings? There was anxiety in traders and investors of Apple since one of Apple's suppliers Dialog Semiconductor ( OTC:DLGNF ) made flat projections for the year. The market immediately connected this news to Apple thinking they have a lot of inventory and the stock plummeted more than 3% for the day. All semiconductor stocks took the beating based on a simple assumption that all trade is based on Apple. This is called guilt by association. Before Apple's report, investors have gotten out of a stock that is held hostage to Apple's actions. "They trade like an Apple-component-ETF tail is wagging their dog," said Cramer. Cramer advised to wait and watch rather than taking evasive action. The bar has been set high by other tech stocks and Apple could have a shortfall. But then the stock is too cheap looking at the PE multiples and growth. "But as for Apple's suppliers? I think there is no need to own them. The action today is just too vicious to fathom. Who needs that level of pain?" concluded Cramer. Signet Jewelers is the company with jewelry store chains such as Kay Jewelers, Zales, Jared and many more with 2,063 locations. The company reported a good quarter last month and is up 25% from its lows in August. Based on Tiffany's (NYSE: TIF ) performance, one can conclude that jewelry is out of style but Signet tells a different story. Last week, Signet was added to Wells Fargo's priority stock list with an outperform rating. The company's success comes from the acquisition of Zales. Cramer thinks that this quarter is the beginning of Signet unlocking value from Zales. "Since Signet reported at the end of August, the stock has been absolutely screaming, and I can't blame any of the buyers who are crowding into this one, because the company has a lot going for it," said Cramer. Signet has 14% market share in the US, which is a very fragmented market where no specialty jewelry store has more than 1% market share. The company has the scale to control costs and have consumer studies. They are also shareholder friendly as they return 75% of free cash flow via dividends and an upcoming buyback program. The entire healthcare sector is under pressure right now and even the stocks that have nothing to do with drug pricing are taking a beating. Consider Ventas, a healthcare REIT with more than 1,200 properties across US, UK and Canada. The company is in real-estate and is not a healthcare provider, but its shares have fallen 24% in the last 6 months. Cramer interviewed CEO Debra Cafaro to find out more. "Our pipeline is incredible. We probably have looked at $40B in deals this year. And our biggest issue is to remain disciplined, be a good capital allocator and try to buy early-cycle investments in all of our different segments," said Cafaro. She also said that the company is looking to to grow EPS at 7-8% which is more than the company's initial estimate. While hospitals may have weak earnings, they still pay their rent to Ventas. Cafaro notes that there is no shortage of properties to be acquired for Ventas and the company has great assets. Cramer likes the stock. Jack In The Box (NASDAQ: JACK ): It's a well-run company and Cramer likes it. J.C. Penney (NYSE: JCP ): Cramer likes the new management but the retail sector looks gloomy since all stocks are near their lows. Relypsa (NASDAQ: RLYP ): There are bigger and better companies in biotech to buy. Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU ): Integrated Device Technology (NASDAQ: IDTI ) is the one to buy.
