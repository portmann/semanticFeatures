Dividend Growth Investors Might Want To Look At Boeing - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Boeing has been more affected by the recent market downturn than other stocks. After starting very well into 2015 and reaching a new high of $158.83 in February, Boeing's (NYSE: BA ) share price fell back to levels that were last seen in January. Of course this needs to be seen in the context of an overall declining market, but the stock underperformed the major indices and stands essentially where it was 20 months ago. The good news is that this development makes Boeing worth considering again. The stock has become more attractively valued based on a lower PE as well as a higher yield and offers a growing dividend. Fundamentally, not much has changed for Boeing. BCA (Boeing Commercial Airplanes) has an impressive order backlog which will fuel growth for the foreseeable future, and the number of aircraft deliveries is projected to climb from 723 in 2014 to 750-755 in 2015 and will grow further in the next few years. The fundamental outlook for the commercial aircraft market remains positive. Boeing forecasts demand for more than 35,000 new planes (without regional jets) in its long-term outlook until 2034. Total revenues increased by 10% in the first half-year with BCA being up 19% while BDS (Boeing Defense, Space & Security) reported 7%, top line decline. Earnings are projected to rise over the next years. The company returns large amounts cash to shareholders through buybacks and growing dividends. However, Boeing's recent 2015 figures do not look that bright. Earnings from operations declined for both BCA and BDS and the margin contracted in the half year. There are some issues which Boeing has to deal with, starting with the deferred production costs for the 787 which still continue to climb. This figure increased by $790M to $27.7B in Q2. In the latest earnings call , Boeing expected a similar increase in Q3 before the program could finally become cash positive in Q4 and deferred production could start to decline at the end of the year. Hopefully the outlook will finally become reality, since this projection is not new, and already last year Boeing's management had expected cash flow break-even by the end of 2015. Order income for BCA has slowed down recently, and Boeing only received only 447 new net orders until end of August on 503 deliveries. If this trend continues, the company will obtain fewer orders than aircraft deliveries for the first time in years. For comparison, in 2014 and 2013 more than 1,500 net orders were received. With an existing order backlog of 5,700 planes worth $431B there's not much to worry about yet, but with a growing number of aircraft deliveries, orders have to follow inevitably to utilize production, and the past tells us that airlines tend to cancel orders quickly in times of a crisis. Further more, there is the KC-46 tanker program where Boeing had to recognize another charge of $835M ($536M after tax) which negatively impacted EPS in the second quarter by $0.77. This has caused Boeing to lower the 2015 core EPS guidance between $7.70 to $7.90. Boeing's product mix is another important topic which impacts the bottom line. The transition from older aircraft which are highly profitable and generate lots of cash to new ones has to progress smoothly in order not to impact BCA's profitability. For example, Boeing sees a dilutive impact from a higher number of 787 and 747 deliveries in the second quarter which is said to be partly responsible for the margin contraction. The 737, 777 and 787 stand for 67%, 14% and 16% of Boeing's deliveries in 2014. The rising share of 787s as a result of the production increase to 10 per month last year and further to 12 airframes per month in 2016 will dilute Boeing's margin even more unless production costs fall. The transition to the new 777X in a few years is another important factor, and selling as many as possible of the old version to ensure a smooth transition is crucial for Boeing. So far, Boeing has been quite successful with 44 orders and commitments for the old 777 that were received in the first half year. Finally, the first delivery of the 737MAX is expected in 2017 and initiates the transition from the 737NG to the new generation of the most successful commercial airplane in history. Some positive news is the order for 50 767 freighters from FedEx including the option for 50 more which was received in June. Although it will not have a major impact when looking at 750 deliveries per year, building more of this old model should be a very profitable business and it will allow Boeing to increase the 767 production rate from 1.5 to 2 per month in 2016. While Boeing's stock trades at the same price as it did 20 months ago, the valuation has become more attractive as earnings per share grew and the dividend increased noticeably. Boeing guides toward core EPS in the range of $7.70 to $7.90 (down from $8.20 to $8.40, as a result of the tanker charge) and GAAP EPS between $7.60 and $7.80 (down from $8.10 and $8.30) for this year. This compares to core EPS of $8.60 and GAAP EPS of $7.38 in 2014. Based on today's analyst consensus of $8.03 for 2015 and $9.31 for next year the FY15 PE stands at 15.9 and the FY16 PE at 13.7. Boeing pays a quarterly dividend of $0.91 or $3.84 for the full year. After the latest share price decline, the yield now stands at 2.8%. This is the highest yield since 2011, and I expect another healthy raise with the first payment in 2016. Boeing's dividend grew by 50% in 2014 and 25% in 2015. This dividend growth history in combination with a rather low payout ratio of only 50% based on the expected 2015 diluted GAAP EPS bodes well for the next years. BA Dividend Yield (TTM) data by YCharts Boeing also spends billions on share repurchases which automatically help to grow EPS. In the second quarter, the company bought back 14 million shares for $2B. In total $6B were returned to shareholders through dividends and repurchases from January to June. The market currently does not favor BA which is down 18% from its all-time high earlier in the year. The worries about China, leading to the question whether demand for new airplanes in the country and in other emerging markets will fall short of expectations and negatively impact Boeing. Should the stock market turmoil continue, there is a fair chance that the stock might fall below $120 which could be a very good opportunity to load up this stock at an attractive price and for a 3% dividend yield including the outlook for more next year. I still consider Boeing a very attractive combination of a growth and an income stock despite the not entirely convincing 2015 business performance. Trading in the range between $120 and $130 I believe that the stock is more attractively priced again and a clear buy if it falls below $120. The fundamental outlook is intact for at least the next decade which makes Boeing a conservative investment for long-term oriented investors looking for both dividend growth and share price appreciation potential.
