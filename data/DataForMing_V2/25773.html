Samsung watches for a Galaxy S6-led rebound The Apple Watch rightly won the gadget launch of the week, mainstreaming a listless smartwatch market andÂ breathing viability into an aesthetically challenged wearables landscape.Â But while Apple seems to perennially transcend expectations,Â rival Samsung hopes that today’s announcement of its newest pair of flagship Galaxy S6 smartphones will continue to pull the company’s financials back in a positive direction afterÂ a 2014 ebb. As this Reuters graphic reflects ,Â Samsung sold 40 million of its then-flagship Galaxy S4 phones within the first six months of release , pushing 2013 third-quarter operating profits to an all-time high ofÂ 10.16 trillion Korean wonâ€”$9.65 billion. A year later,Â  that number tumbled to about 40 percent of that figureâ€”$3.68 billionâ€”but profits have since rebounded, even ahead of what some analysts say could be a 50 million unit year for the Galaxy S6 . Meanwhile,Â  Samsung shares have hardly struggled , easily outperforming theÂ Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI), and up around 80 percent since the beginning of 2010.
