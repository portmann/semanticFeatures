Next yearâ€™s iPhone to get major redesign, says KGIâ€™s Kuo - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Mar 28 2016, 13:53 ET | By: Brian Pacampara, CFA , SA News Editor Citing sources, KGI Securities’ Ming Chi Kuo says in a note to investors that Apple ( AAPL -0.3%) has plans to introduce a new high-end iPhone model in 2017 that sports a curved glass case and 5.8-inch AMOLED display. Much like the iPhone 4, Kuo believes that Apple will ultimately settle on glass for its 2017 iPhone casing “as plastic doesn’t offer thin and light form factor designs, and it would be not easy to precisely control the tolerance of ceramic.” Kuo adds that Apple’s 2017 iPhone will adopt a curved display with curved glass body, feature a glass front and back with metal sides, and have a “more comfortable grip.” Kuo also says that Apple will introduce a new 5.8-inch iPhone in 2017 with an AMOLED display. Kuo adds that if Apple is able to produce enough of the 5.8-inch AMOLED displays, the larger device will entirely replace the 5.5-inch model. In related analyst news, UBS says they are looking for 10% iPhone growth for Apple in 2017 on the belief that iPhone sales have not yet peaked. RBC Capital, meanwhile, estimates that Apple could boost its dividend by 10%-15% and raise its buyback authorization by $40B-$50B.
