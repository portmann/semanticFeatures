Fitbit A Buy On Apple Earnings - Fitbit, Inc. (NYSE:FIT) | Seeking Alpha Without presenting data, Apple's CEO states that Apple Watch sales "met expectations". Following Apple's earnings release, Fitbit shares have finally fallen to $17. I am currently holding a long position in FIT in anticipation of earnings, which is based on high confidence in an earnings beat on May 4th. In February, the company gave very soft guidance for Q1, sending the share price plummeting from $16.50 to under $12.00. Not long after this drop, Fitbit issued press releases detailing that one million Blaze and Alta units were shipped in March, which was not anticipated in the most recent earnings report and has not led to an increase in the consensus estimate of $0.02 EPS for Q1. It's important to note that these shipped devices are considered to be sold when it comes to earnings. This makes it even more surprising that the FIT share price is slipping on the following declarations by Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) CEO Tim Cook, where he indicates that Apple Watch sales met "company expectations" in the March quarter, and that Apple Watch first-year sales exceeded the iPhone's first-year sales. Despite these statements, Apple has buried Watch sales in its data , making them uninterpretable. Several Seeking Alpha contributors have pointed out that it is unlikely that the Watch competes directly with any of Fitbit's products. Nevertheless, Apple's product continually has an impact on Fitbit's share price. For investors who were hoping to open a position in FIT, this news presents a good opportunity. A string of bullish reports and press releases has made it unlikely that any significant headwinds will drive the price down before earnings are reported next week. Also, bearish articles have all but disappeared as short interest has fallen precipitously. The market has irrationally reacted to Apple's earnings report after-hours, presenting a buying opportunity in Fitbit, which is poised to beat earnings in a week's time. I predict a share price in the range of $18-20, or 5.6-17.4% upside within a one-week time frame from FIT's current after-hours price of $17.04. Investors interested in initiating a long position may be attracted to the steady growth of the wearables market and Fitbit's consistent ability to beat expectations with every earnings report that has been released.
