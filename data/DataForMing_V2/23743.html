Verizon: Is 4.43% Greater Than 5.90%? Sometimes - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha Verizon is held out by many as an attractive, dividend-paying stock, which it is. Investors have more than one way to invest in Verizon for income, and should explore their options. A couple of weeks ago, I wrote an article titled " The REIT Dividend Delusion " where I compared REIT equity and REIT preferred, in which I opined: Bottom Line: If you are an income investor utilizing REITs for their income characteristics, you have options and should seriously look at this as a potential opportunity to increase your income without taking outsized risks. If you think the equity has growth, supplement your income with a combination of common and preferred. The preferred space has opportunity and may help you achieve your goals in a more appropriate manner. The article met with mixed reactions (and comments), but I continue to stand by both the premise and the conclusion. Essentially, depending on the rate of dividend growth, an income investor might be advantaged by buying higher-yielding preferred and having higher cumulative dividends for over a decade. Recently, I have been looking at Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ ) as I consider it to be a "best in breed" communications company. One of the attractive features of this bellwether has always been its dividend, and this has been written about in countless articles on Seeking Alpha. As I was looking at the company (I have owned the bonds and equity over the years), I recalled that a little over a year ago, I wrote an article on a Verizon "baby bond," where I compared its $25 par senior note to outstanding Verizon debt. Let me begin by saying that I was biased towards the equity before beginning, as I like the company and find its dividend an added bonus. That said, I also realize that the company's growth is both limited and expensive. This is why, I believe, so many investors buy Verizon for the fat yield rather than capital appreciation. But is the yield fat or is it an illusion that leads to a dividend delusion? Most investors are familiar with Verizon and its equity. Fewer are familiar with its "baby bond" that was issued last year (it trades under the ticker VZA, which is how I will often refer to it). To rectify that, my prior article is linked above, and here is a summary of the bonds: I will be following the same process as I did with "The Dividend Delusion," where I look at the cash flow from the equity and the "option," in this case the baby bonds. Before I do so, however, it might be helpful to compare the yield on the common versus the yield on the baby bonds to see where they compare versus historical levels. First a comparison between the current yield or yield to maturity and the dividend yield of the common: As the above chart shows, the yield to maturity of VZA is not at the narrowest margin, but is narrower than it has historically been. As the above chart shows, the dividend yield is higher than the bond's yield to call. If a call is assumed, the bonds should be avoided. In order to put the above yield relationships in context, the following charts showing the relationship between the equity and preferred stock of Realty Income (NYSE: O ) and Kimco Realty (NYSE: KIM ) might be helpful. Realize that this is between the equity and the preferred stock, not between the equity and the bonds, as is the case with Verizon. I have specifically used these two REITs to facilitate comparison between the Verizon assessment and my prior article on the REIT dividend delusion. With Realty Income, two observations are notable: the yield to call less the dividend yield is significantly more negative than is the case with Verizon, and the current yield less the dividend yield is significantly higher than it is with Verizon. Mixed results, admittedly, but conceptually reasonable given the difference in the capital structure between the preferred and the debt. This could infer that the equity to bond income swap is not as compelling - the delusion not so great - as it was with the REITs. The charts above show that Kimco preferreds have a positive yield advantage on a yield-to-call and current yield basis. Again, this is what I might expect given the level of the capital structure at which each security resides. Again, it appears that the case for the REITs might be easier to make than the case for Verizon. Here are the numbers that will show if income investors are better served in the bonds or the stocks. As the above table and graph show, at the five-year dividend growth rate of nearly three percent, it will take the equity 12 years to grow into the cash flow of the bonds. Twelve years. That is a long period of time. Perhaps there is a Verizon dividend delusion. It is, however, important to realize the difference between these two types of vehicles in terms of taxes. Unlike REITs, where distributions are taxed at ordinary income rates, the VZ equity is QDI while VZA [debt] is taxed as ordinary income as it is interest. This necessitates an analysis that takes taxes into consideration. To do this, I made the following assumptions: The ordinary income tax rate is 30%, and the tax rate on qualified dividends is 15%. When taxes are considered, the advantage clearly lies with the common equity. With taxes, there is no dividend delusion. Bottom Line: The bottom line is there is no clear decision with the Verizon dividend yield versus the bonds. For an investor in a taxable account, the Verizon equity is a solid choice. For an account where taxes aren't a constraint (for example, a retirement account), VZA will provide an investor with greater cash flow. Ultimately, the objective of the investor and the type of the account in which the investment is held will dictate/influence the selection. The important thing is the realization that within the Verizon capital complex, there are options available to investors, and the fat dividend of the common may not hold the same benefits as the yield/cash flow of VZA. Of course, an investor has to realize the following: The focus of this article and the analysis was income and the income investor. The equity has a greater likelihood of generating a higher total return, as it will not be subject to the "convexity effect," whereas there is a limit to the potential price increase of VZA as there is a call feature. VZA is exposed to potentially greater interest rate risk, due to the fixed coupon and a reduced ability to benefit from economic growth, or the potential growth in revenue, income and earnings, which would benefit the common shares. If an investor is a fixed-income investor, VZA is attractive relative to the outstanding debt of Verizon (the $1,000 par). A summary comparison is as follows: In the beginning of the article/analysis, I stated that I was biased towards the equity, as I like the company and its position within its market. One of the issues I have with owning the equity is that Verizon is playing within the saturated US market, and growth going forward will be expensive in terms of spectrum and infrastructure while dealing with the price wars of the commodity we call cellular communications. At first, I noticed that the common stock trades at a discount to the market multiple (P/E) and thought there might be some room for multiple expansion. To assess this, I compared the historical P/E of VZ to the S&P. Here are the results: As this chart shows, Verizon normally trades at a discounted multiple to the market; in fact, the discount that it currently trades at is not as much as normal. If the equity is going to be purchased with the premise of multiple expansion, I would not be optimistic. Another factor I often read about is an increase in the payout ratio, which would increase the dividend growth rate and either narrow or eliminate the VZA advantage. Exploring this, I found: The possibility of an increased payout to investors is, in my opinion, more favorable than multiple expansion. That said, however, the cost of spectrum acquisition and infrastructure build could take priority over returning capital to shareholders in the form of a significantly increased dividend. Bottom Bottom Line: Income investors and DGI folks should seriously consider VZA rather than VZ if their focus is primarily income and the investment resides in a tax advantaged account.
