Intel Corp (NASDAQ: INTC ) completed the acquisition of Altera (NASDAQ: ALTR ). Effective at the close today, Altera will be removed from the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA: SPY ).

This was one of my first long ideas discussed on Sifting the World . Since then, it has returned over 25%. Ferrari (NYSE: RACE ) is recalling some California Ts due to fire risk from fuel leaks. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration/NHTSA , 185 California Ts have low-pressure fuel lines that might not be property connected to the fuel pump feed pile.

It is a particularly sensitive problem for Ferrari owners because even if they are on fire on the side of the road, no one feels sorry for them because they are still Ferrari owners.
