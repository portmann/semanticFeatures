How Many Watches Did Apple Sell Last Quarter? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha I now believe that Apple Watch sold no more than 800,000 units last quarter. This is about half of my initial estimate of 1.7 million, and one-third of the "official" estimate by Strategy Analytics. The cause of the revision is a more bullish assessment of Apple TV's revenue. Since Apple TV and Watch are both "Other Products," increasing estimates for one results in decreased estimates for the other. Declining iPod sales are not sufficient to account for the gap between the revenue numbers and the estimates. The revenue numbers are official, so the estimates are too high. As most of you reading this probably know already, I have been the author of a number of articles concerning the competition between Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and the Fitbit (NYSE: FIT ) product line. In the ensuing commentary from Seeking Alpha readers I was asked by one commentator if I saw the latest estimates of 2.2 million Watches sold last quarter to be reasonably accurate. I replied that it seemed a little on the high side to me but that it probably wasn't too far off. I must correct that estimate. Further research has led me to believe that Apple may have suffered a rather large shortfall in Watch sales last quarter. In fact, sales were probably under the 1 million unit threshold. My thesis of a looming shortfall for one of the two companies has generated no small amount of pushback. To be clear, I have not taken a bear position on one company or the other, at least not yet. I have simply said it is highly unlikely that the wearables market will expand fast enough for both of them to achieve the sales growth their respective bull traders have set for them. In my opinion one of them must fall short, with an accompanying fall in their stock price. I did not call Apple the loser in any of my previous articles, and I am not calling it the loser now. Since my qualifications about my position don't always seem to translate, let me be very clear: all I am about to say is offered in support of the idea that Apple Watch had a bad quarter, last quarter. That's all. I make no claim that it hasn't had good quarters, I make no claim Apple is losing the wearables war. I am convinced, however, that they had a very bad quarter. Strategy Analytics is the source of the 2.2 million units estimate. The 2.2 million number always seemed a little high to me. 2.2 million units at even a measly $400 ASP would have put Watch revenue at $880 million. That never seemed very likely, since Apple's most recent earnings report had "Other Products," which is Watch, TV, Beats and iPod, at $2.19 billion total. The number was only $500 million more than a year ago, which was the last quarter before Watch launched. So even if none of the other categories had grown at all, 1.2 million would have probably been closer to the truth. Of course, iPod sales might make up some of the discrepancy. Sales of iPods have been falling for years, so if Watch picked up all the net growth, plus all the decline in iPod sales, it could grow more than the whole category. The problem is, iPod sales just aren't big enough. Apple has not reported iPod sales since the last quarter of FY 2014 when they came to $410 million. In 2Q 2014, two years ago, they came to $461 million. Even if that number declined all the way to zero, spreading the decline linearly over two years would mean that iPod sales were only $230 million lower this year than last year. At $730 million, Watch sales would still only be about 1.8 million units. And Apple is still selling iPods, of course. Since peaking in 2010, iPod sales declined by 16%, 17%, 24% and 47% over the next four years. That sudden plunge in 2014, the last year for which we have data, might have something to do with the iPod Classic being discontinued that year. The most Watch-friendly way to estimate the numbers is to assume that sales stabilized in 2015 and then collapsed again in 2016. At the risk of stating the obvious, this is because Watch sales are being compared to the Watch-free 2015. A decline from 2014 to 2015 actually hurts Watch sales estimates, since that's a decline which already happened outside the data and which therefore cannot contribute to Watch revenues. The more revenue was left over in 2015, the bigger a given percentage decline is revenue-wise in 2016. I will assume replication of the last two years for which we have data, which is a roughly one-quarter drop followed by a one-half drop. I suspect this is being overly generous to Apple Watch. At that rate the decline in iPod revenues would come to at most $180 million, leaving $680 million for Apple Watch. At $400 ASP, that would come to 1.7 million units. This is about where I thought Apple Watch sales were when I answered the question. Even Apple CFO Luca Maestri's comment that "most of the growth" belonged to Watch on the earnings call didn't really phase me. As I said, there's also the iPod decline, so if he meant that it got most of the net growth plus all the iPod decline it didn't change the number much. The extent of Apple TV's growth, however, does. While Apple CEO Tim Cook won't give us exact sales figures for "Other Products," he did call out the Apple TV and Watch as both having set sales records over the holidays, and there's no reason I can see that Watch would keep its popularity while TV suddenly plunged going into 2016. And more recent reports have made clear that for Apple TV, strong growth is simply too strong to leave Watch's growth intact. Specifically, Parks Associates found that Apple TV sales doubled in 2015 compared to 2014. Of course, we are interested in the '15-'16 ratio. But Apple's growth is presumably down to the launch of the new Apple TV, which didn't launch until the last quarter of 2015. So, last quarter was the first January-March quarter where Apple had a 4th-gen TV compared to a 3rd-gen TV in 2015. So presumably the effect was the same in this quarter. Actually, it was probably even worse than that. If Apple TV's new iteration really was the cause of the sales growth, and it didn't even kick in until the last quarter of the year, then presumably sales in that quarter had to more than double in order to hit the double-mark for the whole year. In fact, even assuming that the holidays accounted for a full 40% of sales, they would have had to more than triple to hit that mark. But let's be conservative - again - and assume that all TV sales did were double over last year. Actual numbers are kind of difficult. But if Parks was right that Roku was at 8 million lifetime at end of 2013, and Apple TV had sold five for every two Rokus, then Roku's hitting the 10 million lifetime mark in September 2014 would put its total 2014 sales at three million or so, which equals 7.5 million Apple TV's in 2014. Which equals 15 million Apple TV's in 2015. Apple TV's CY 2016 sales are pegged to go as high as 24 million . 40% of those in the holiday quarter, as we are assuming, leaves 20% in each of the other three quarters, only half of which are new sales. So that's 2.4 million new units of Apple TV sales. The growth is presumably all new models, which have a base price of $149 but can go higher. Conservative, again. Let's assume that all the new sales are at the lowest possible new unit price. That's $150 x 2.4 million for $360 million in net growth of Apple TV sales. That's almost certainly low. Not only might ASP or units have been higher, but also a lot of the old sales that were for the $69 model last year probably upgraded to the new $149 model. But the old $69 model is still available, so let's assume not a single existing buyer upgraded. Which is not at all how Apple customers behave, butâ€¦. That means that Watch does not get to keep all, or even most, of the iPod/net growth money for itself. It has to share a substantial portion of it with another product. Apple TV and Apple Watch are both drinking from the same trough, revenue-wise. What's good for one is bad for the other. Subtracting Apple TV's low-ball $360 million leaves only $320 million for the Apple Watch. That's still more than half of "net growth," so it may well have been what the CFO meant. Even though by these estimates Watch isn't even the biggest revenue grower in the Other Products category. That brings us to the final point. Up till now we've been assuming a super-conservative $400 ASP. But Apple's price cut didn't even kick in until March 21st, so almost the entire quarter was spent with a hard $350 floor under the price. The 42mm model started at $400, and the prices go all the way up to $17,000. What's the real number? Estimates for ASP vary widely. Wristly, which has been conducting regular surveys of smartwatch buyers since before Apple Watch even launched, says ASP is sitting at $529 - this after saying for months that the number could have been anywhere between $425 and $550. Meanwhile, other analysts really do have it as low as $400 . I will leave it at $400, but again, that seems low to me. $320 million divided by $400 ASP leaves only 800,000 units sold. Less than one million. A little less conservative assumptions and the number could easily have come out even lower. Again, this means nothing except for... what it means. It seems more and more likely that Apple Watch had a really bad quarter to open the year. Perhaps that was part of why the price was cut. But overall estimates are more positive, with a projected first year total of 12 million sold . So this is hardly dispositive of Apple Watch's final, overall trajectory.
