Verizon Post-Retirement Benefits Analysis - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha Extensive pension liabilities impact future cash flows. According to the company's website, Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ ) was created in 2000 when Bell Atlantic and GTE merged together. What came with the merger and subsequent operations were significant pension liabilities. As of 12/31/2014, Verizon lists 177,300 current employees and 209,000 retirees as eligible to participate in its various benefit plans. The paragraphs that follow are an attempt to better understand Verizon's post-retirement obligations and impact to future cash flows. I encourage you to provide feedback to help make the overall analysis more accurate. With this information, I intend to follow up with an article to value Verizon's shares using a discounted cash flow model approach. During the fourth quarter of 2010, Verizon decided to change the method of accounting for its benefit plan obligations to mark-to-market accounting. This change creates earnings volatility and complicates traditional ratio analysis for valuation purposes. Some may argue this is a more accurate picture of current year results while others may point out that benefit payments are paid out over many years and therefore annual valuation adjustments are unnecessary. Regardless of the accounting treatment, the underlying future cash flows are what I'm most concerned about and the impact on share valuation. Note 12 in the 2014 annual report provides information regarding post-retirement benefits. Looking at the funded status reported on the balance sheet is a good starting point along with Prior Service Costs reported on the Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income statement (AOCI). Verizon has set aside very little assets to cover its healthcare and life (HC&L) obligations. This is common in many U.S. companies but in Verizon's case its HC&L obligations are higher than its pension obligations at $27.1 billion with only $2.4 billion of assets in the plan. Pension laws require certain funding ratios on pension obligations to prevent additional insurance costs to the company, typically around 70%. Verizon is hovering around that number and therefore will likely have to contribute to the plan depending on market conditions and actuarial assumptions. Up to this point, what's clear to me is Verizon has significant post-retirement obligations that may require additional contributions. Now I would like to compare what Verizon has been expensing on its income statement the past three years relative to its cash contributions to the plans. For this exercise, I will leave out the large annual mark-to-market valuation adjustments and assume a tax rate of 35%. Now, let's take a look at what cash contributions Verizon has been making to its post-retirement plans. 2015 data is the estimate described in the Employee Benefit Plan Funded Status and Contributions section of the 2014 10-k report. With an average of $1.332 billion cash contributions in excess of what's being expensed on the income statement, this seems like a reasonable amount to include in a cash flow analysis going forward. What do you think? Am I being too aggressive or conservative with my estimate of $1.3 B? With a more accurate figure, I will follow-up with my estimated value of Verizon's shares.
