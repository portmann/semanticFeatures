Why Apple Could See All Time Highs In Less Than 12 Months | Seeking Alpha We reached "peak iPhone 7 hatred" two weeks ago. Since then Apple has impressed on earnings, driving the stock up 8% in one day versus usual post-earnings moves of just 2% or 3%. This marks a sentiment shift going into the iPhone 7 launch and we make a case as to why Apple could be at all-time-highs within 12 months. With the serious change in sentiment we have seen regarding Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) stock after the company beat expectations on its last earnings report, and among scattered first glances of the iPhone 7, we think Apple could surprise the markets and move much higher by the end of this year. We also think there's a common-sense road to Apple trading at all time highs within the next 12 months. We wrote about Apple a couple of weeks ago, suggesting that we were at "peak iPhone 7 hatred" and that it would probably be a good time to start considering AAPL stock after the iPhone 7 launch. We're amending that slightly and wanted to note why we think Apple may actually be a good buy going into the iPhone 7 launch right now. Our previous main argument was that everybody was already expecting the iPhone 7 to be a heinous failure; therefore all of the negative sentiment regarding the phone may have already been priced in. We stated: Expectations for the iPhone 7 have been extraordinarily low, and likely for good reason. The announcement that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) was not going to be making any mass of upgrades to the phone has already turned off consumers, us included, to the concept of upgrading. The 7, while not branded a "flop" yet because we don't yet have sales data, is certainly being questioned by the media more than any other model we've seen. Here's a taste of what Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) has offered on the iPhone 7. Querying the phone on its own shows many articles calling it into question. Querying the phone with the word "flop" or asking whether its worth the upgrade from the iPhone 6 produces a litany of results. All we heard, month after month, day after day was that the 7 was not the model to pay attention to and that the 8 was going to be the dramatic redesign. Analysts came out with negative comments and expectations were set low. Heading into the earnings report, sentiment was decidedly bearish . Then something funny happened; Apple beat its numbers and the stock took the first breath it has been able to take since trading around $130. The stock roared after the July 26 report. On an earnings report that we believe would normally only send the stock up 2% or 3%, Apple surged more than 8% in daily trading on the company's better than expected results. This surge, we believe, unlocked a new barrage of bullish sentiment on the company that had been locked away since the company failed to break $130. Now, for the first time in a while, it is starting to feel as though Apple could move higher. Fundamental analysts always had a case with the company's valuation. Technical analysts may start to feel some bullish tingle as well for the first time in months. We got a look at the iPhone 7 from t his exclusive photo leak that was posted online by Business Insider. While it does seem similar to the iPhone 6, there appears to be a new feel to the operating system, as you can see here: These changes in and of themselves chip away at the cynical thesis that 7 will be the exact same phone as the 6, "just without the headphone jack." Aside from these obvious cosmetic upgrades, users can expect a faster processor and an improved camera as well. A lot has changed on the inside; it is just that there are not that many visible changes on the outside. Despite this, the 7 is definitely going to be an upgrade. If consumers unexpectedly embrace this iPhone more than the Street has imagined, it could be a real inflection point for Apple stock. The Streets analyst estimates are so low and expectations have been set so low for this phone, that any small glance of success or notion of beating estimates will likely send Apple stock back towards its highs around $130. Apple stock has a bullish tailwind to it for the first time in months. We firmly believe that with a seismic sentiment change, and with the hype surrounding the iPhone 8 going to be unbearable, Apple could very well be sitting at all-time highs just 12 short months from when we release this article. The roadmap to all time highs looks like this: 3. The iPhone 7 may not turn out to be as bad as everyone thinks 4. Then, we have a real media event brewing in the iPhone 8 launch, which the media is already covering and will cover exhaustively until launch Valuation, as many know with Apple, was never a problem impeding the bull cash. Apple is a fundamentally firm company with hundreds of billions of dollars in the bank that generates an enormous sum of free cash every quarter. AAPL Free Cash Flow (NYSE: TTM ) data by YCharts Despite being a cash machine, Apple is valued as if it is a staple stock and not a technology company, with a price to earnings ratio usually in the low 12x-13x region. The possibility for multiple expansion, on top of the company growing organically, is almost unlimited. AAPL PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts There is a simple case for the company trading 50% or 100% percent higher than what it is now simply based on it deserving a more aggressive multiple. Microsoft trades at a forward PE of 20X. After all, this is a technology company, not Procter & Gamble. Aside from returning cash to shareholders, Apple has many ways to unlock this value for shareholders. One of the most under-examined ways of unlocking value, that we think may be prudent in Apple's case, would be spinning off some of its divisions. Perhaps Beats can be turned around and again be made public? These are all questions for Tim Cook, not for us. What we are confident in, however, is that the iPhone 7 is likely to be better received than most on Wall Street think. We think this "surprise " could make the second half of this year a lucrative time to be an Apple investor. After that, you have the excitement and the anticipation of the iPhone 8, which is rumored to be the dramatic redesign that the analysts on Wall Street love to crow about before it is released. We see nothing but blue skies ahead for Apple, and we remain bullish on the company.
