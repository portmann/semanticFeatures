Apple Music: A $2 Billion Run-Rate Business By April 2016 - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple is entering the music streaming market during a period of extreme growth. We believe this business will have a $2 billion run-rate by April 2016. If Apple and Tim Cook can execute on getting 100 million subs, Apple's topline would be boosted by $3.6 billion. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) recently launched Apple Music, the tech-company's official introduction to the content-distribution-as-as-subscription model business. In a year's time, we believe Apple Music will have a $2 billion run-rate. In the April 2013 quarter, Apple reported $4 billion in iTunes billings on 575 million subscribers. That equates to roughly $6.95 in billings per subscriber. This means that individuals with an iTunes account spent, on average, $6.95 in the quarter on iTunes and related services. In the April 2014 quarter, Apple reported $5.2 billion, 30% YoY growth, in iTunes billings on 800 million subscribers. That equates to roughly $6.50 in billings per subscriber. This means that individuals with an iTunes account spent, on average, $6.50 in the quarter on iTunes and related services. Apple CEO Tim Cook is aiming for 100 million subscribers for Apple Music. Ignoring the family plan, that equates to roughly a $12 billion annualized run-rate in additional iTunes bookings (100 million * $10 * 12 months). On a quarterly basis, 100 million subscribers would add about $3 billion (100 million * $10 * 3 months). For now, let us assume Apple can net 100 million subscribers by the April 2016 quarter. If we assume iTunes organic revenue growth slows to 20-25% by then and add $3 billion to that organic growth, we arrive at roughly $9.37 billion in iTunes billings for the April 2016 quarter. Assuming subs growth continues to be strong at 40%, we believe this $9.37 billion in billings will come from 1.12 billion subscribers. All this equates to roughly $8.36 in billings per subscriber for the June 2016 quarter, far outpacing the previous two years' $6.95 and $6.50 figures. All in all, we don't think the average iTunes subscriber quarterly billings-rate will pick up 29% due to Apple Music. We therefore believe that while 100 million subscribers may be possible in the future, that figure will most likely not be realized within a year's time. So what is a reasonable figure by April 2016? Here, we can attempt to reverse-engineer a subs number that makes sense based on a likely billings per sub figure. We think it is safe to assume that quarterly billings per sub pick up to $7.00 in the April 2016 quarter. With this assumption, we can multiply this by our projected 1.12 billion subscribers in April 2016 to arrive at a $7.84 billion iTunes billings figure. If we take out $6.37 billion from organically grown iTunes billings, then we are left with $1.47 billion in total billings in the quarter from Apple Music. Dividing this figure by $30 leads us to roughly 49 million Apple Music subs by April 2016. Currently, Spotify has 20 million paid and 75 million total subs. We believe this makes our 49 million assumption seem fair as it shows Apple Music's ability to not only steal market share but grow market size as well. Roughly 70% of those billings will go to labels, musicians and producers, leaving 30% as revenue for Apple. This yields $441 million in Apple Music revenue for Apple for the quarter, the equivalent of a $1.76 billion run-rate. Apple grew net revenues by $12 billion last year. Therefore, a business with a $1.76 billion and presumably growing run-rate would be significant for the company's topline growth. So, while we believe 100 million subscribers is a little farther out than a year, we also affirm that a business adding a minimum of $1.76 billion to the company's topline is very good news. Important to note, 100 million subscribers would add about $3.6 billion to the company's topline, and given the advantages of Apple Music outlined above, we do not believe this is an unlikely scenario in a few years. We do, however, accredit that 100 million subscribers is an aggressive goal given Spotify's total user count is 25% lower than this. Even without 100 million subscribers, Apple Music still has upside for investors. If we reverse-engineer a subs number from flat billings per subscriber YoY of $6.50, we arrive at roughly 30 million subs by the April 2016 quarter, yielding an annualized run-rate of just under $1 billion. Again, a $1 billion addition to a topline that grew $12 billion last year its sizable, and considering this calculation assumes flat billings per subscriber YoY, we believe this sizable addition is highly conservative. The biggest challenge Apple will have to navigate in the streaming music market is exclusive content. Many high profile streaming services, like Apple Music, Spotify and Tidal, offer exclusive content. For example, Spotify streams concert perfomances under the "Spotify Sessions" series. Tidal has released exclusive music videos by many high-profile artists . Apple Music is the much publicized exclusive streaming service of Taylor Swift's newest album 1989. At this point, a fractionally small percentage of releases are exclusive to a single streaming service. However, it is possible that the music streaming market becomes a battle for exclusivity rights, not unlike the video streaming market . In order for such a shift to occur, an A-List artist would have to exclusively release a new album on a streaming service. If such an endeavor is successful and new music releases turn into bidding wars for exclusivity rights, then Apple and its stockpile of cash would have an advantage over its streaming competitors, but it would take away from Apple's vision for Apple Music to be the central and unified hub for the entire music world. More importantly, a fragmented streaming market would ruin the primary incentive from a consumer standpoint to stream music instead of download it: convenience. Music fans won't subscribe to three different services at a time in order to listen to their three favorite artists. Instead, they will download them from the iTunes Store or pirate them. It is not guaranteed that exclusive releases become the norm for streaming services, but it is in Apple's best interest not to start a bidding war for artists and albums in order to protect the value of streaming music from a consumer standpoint. In conclusion, we feel Apple Music is yet another addition to Apple's already expansive ecosystem of hardware and software products. Yet it could be the revolutionary product that investors have been waiting for since the launch of the iPhone. Consider the role that music has played in the monumental growth of Apple over the past 15 years. The release and ultimate success of the iPod in 2001 began Apple's transition from selling computer hardware and software to becoming a consumer electronics company. By 2006, net sales of iPods exceeded net sales of all Macintosh computers. The seamless inclusion of iPod functionality in the first generation iPhone, as well as the introduction of mobile iTunes store downloads in 2009, was a significant factor in Apple's resounding success in the smartphone market. History demonstrates that investment in the music industry can be a major catalyst for Apple's growth. With Apple Music, Apple is making a significant step toward establishing dominance in the hardware, software and content distribution markets.
