Qualcomm's Real Problem Is Its Capital Structure And Troubled QCT Business - Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) | Seeking Alpha Ben Strubel , Strubel Investment Management (169 clicks) The QCT business is becoming increasingly commoditized and under threat from vertically integrated players like Samsung. QCT is cyclical and requires a conservative capital structure. The QTL business has multi-year, high-margin recurring revenue streams and can support a more debt-heavy capital structure. Qualcomm's (NASDAQ: QCOM ) stock has fallen fairly precipitously over the past few months as investors have begun to question the company's results and its role in the future mobile handset landscape. A large part of the company's problem has to do with the fact it is essentially two very different businesses housed together in one corporation. While there are certainly synergies between the mobile technology licensing business (QTL) and the chip business (QCT), the company would be better off separating the two. The different operating characteristics of the two businesses make it impossible for Qualcomm's management to optimize the company's capital structure. In addition, an increase in competition in the company's QCT business means that it may be better off merged to create a stronger player in the mobile chip business. Qualcomm's QCT chip business is quickly becoming commoditized as it faces increasing competition. The biggest threat comes from large, vertically integrated players such as Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) that can design and build their own chips for use in their own mobile products. In addition to these headwinds, the business is highly cyclical. The chip business has high upfront costs as each company must spend significant amounts of capital designing each new generation of a chip. The chip companies also face uncertainty about how much revenue each chip will generate. How many design wins a particular chip gets, or industry supply issues, can cause wide fluctuations in revenues and profits. Thus, most chip businesses tend to be conservatively capitalized with lots of equity and little debt. This allows these businesses survive cyclical downturns or a certain chip design being a marketplace dud. There is little else to be said about the QCT business as it is simply one of the many players in the mobile chip industry. Qualcomm's licensing business on the other hand is its crown jewel. The QTL business can count on a relatively steady stream of royalty payments, and thus, requires a completely different capital structure to optimize shareholder value. While there is volatility with royalty payments, particularly when it comes to negotiating deals and settling the inevitable patent-related lawsuits, this does not mean that the business can't support a more debt-heavy capital structure. Over multi-year time frames, the business generates a substantial amount of cash flow and has little need for large capital expenditures. Indeed, the most expensive part of the business is likely ongoing R&D and legal costs associated with securing licensing deals. However, because the QTL business is combined under the same corporate umbrella, it is virtually impossible for management to utilize the most efficient capital structure, because it also needs to take into account the QCT business unit. To see how stark the difference in capital structures can be, look at a pure-play licensing company such as InterDigital (NASDAQ: IDCC ). That company has a debt-to-equity ratio of 83%. Now compare that to Qualcomm as a whole which has a debt-to-equity ratio of 32%. From a capitalization perspective, QTL and QCT have vastly different needs, and this points to the need to separate the two business units. I have seen a lot of discussion regarding the ability of QTL to operate outside of QCT. While there are certain synergies with the two business units operating separately, there is a precedent for standalone patent licensing companies that do their own in-house R&D. InterDigital operates in the mobile technology space and is probably the closest peer for what a standalone QTL might look like. InterDigital's sole product is patents. It does not design or manufacture anything. While sometimes labeled a patent troll, it is important to emphasize that the company has an extensive in-house R&D team responsible for inventing and patenting new technologies. While we are on the subject of IDCC, it's also a good time to point out how similar it is to QCOM when it comes to reacting to news. Below is the stock chart of IDCC for the past five years: Much like QCOM, we can see that the stock reacts with rather extreme ups and downs based on patent licensing news such as how various court cases or negotiations are proceeding. It's important to keep this in mind with QCOM, especially regarding the latest news that the company is facing an anti-trust probe in South Korea. Just as InterDigital made it through several trials and tribulations regarding patent licensing disputes, so too will the QTL portion of Qualcomm, and just like IDCC, the road will be bumpy. So what should Qualcomm do? In my opinion, the ideal situation would be a simple "merger of equals" between Qualcomm and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ). The resultant company would form a mobile technology behemoth, however, assets may need to be sold off in order to satisfy regulators or business partners. It's likely that almost a complete spin off of the QTL business would be needed. Intel and Qualcomm shareholders would both stand to benefit. Despite vast efforts and the spending of large amounts of shareholder capital, Intel has made little progress breaking into the mobile chip business. Qualcomm's QCT business would give the company the ticket into that area it desperately wants. QCOM's QCT business would also benefit from access to INTC's world-class fab facilities, and the vertical integration of chip design and fabrication should allow the combined business to be very profitable. It would also make the QCT business more competitive versus the emerging mobile chip leader Samsung. Only Intel would give QCT the technical and manufacturing firepower to take on a surging Samsung. A combined Intel and QCT would allow the company to carry more debt because the combination of both business units would remove some cyclicality but it still would not be an optimal capital structure. Spinning out QTL from the combined company would also allow the new entity to optimize its capital structure as well. As of this writing, Qualcomm sports a market cap of around $75B with $31B in cash and securities and $9.9B in long-term debt. Essentially, the core ongoing business operations of QCOM are being valued at $53.9B. With Qualcomm trading at multi-year lows and with the Fed set to start raising interest rates, now would be the time to make a deal. Considering Qualcomm generated $6.5B in free cash flow before accounting for working capital adjustments, there is plenty of financial room for Intel to issue debt to pay for the acquisition. Spinning off or selling QTL would also make the acquisition easier both from a financial and regulatory perspective. While there may be some regulatory resistance to an Intel-Qualcomm QCT merger, we think a deal could still be made. US regulators should take a friendly tack as the deal would allow a US company to better compete against an international one (Samsung). Additionally, the market would still have several large-chip suppliers in Samsung, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) (although it does not make its chips available to third parties), and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) as well as newer entrants such as MediaTek, Spreadtrum, and Broadcom (NASDAQ: BRCM ). Additionally, the semiconductor space is starting to see a wave of deals , the largest being the recent acquisition of Broadcom by Avago (NASDAQ: AVGO ) to create a $77B company. The global regulatory environment also seems conducive to mega mergers as we've seen with the proposed A-B InBev (NYSE: BUD ) and SABMiller ( OTCPK:SBMRY ) mega deal and the recent Pfizer (NYSE: PFE ) and Allergan (NYSE: AGN ) merger proposal. It's not just me that sees Qualcomm's QCT business as a good fit for Intel. Industry magazine EE Times and Barron's have also speculated about an Intel-Qualcomm tie-up. In the end, QCT in the hands of Intel and QTL spun off as a separate operating entity a la InterDigital seem to be the perfect scenario for both QCOM and the long-suffering Intel shareholders. As owners of both Qualcomm and Intel, this is the outcome we are rooting for. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
