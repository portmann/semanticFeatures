GoPro reportedly poaches senior Apple designer; shares soar - GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) | Seeking Alpha Apr 13 2016, 11:01 ET | About: GoPro (GPRO) | By: Eric Jhonsa, SA Eye on Tech , SA News Editor The Information reports Danny Coster, a senior member of Apple's (Jony Ive-led) industrial design team, is leaving to head a new hardware design group at GoPro ( GPRO +12.2%). GoPro has soared on strong volume - 7.7M shares have already been traded vs. a 3-month daily average of 7.6M. 24.2M shares were shorted as of March 31. That's down from 35.3M as of Jan. 15, but still equal to nearly a third of the float. Coster has been with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) since the early '90s, and holds over 500 design patents. A 2006 Bloomberg column on Jony Ive stated Coster did most of the design work for the original iMac "with Ive's close collaboration." Another trader manipulated jump, which we have seen many times before. In fact, my FIT went up 10% today too without the senior designer rumor. At the end, even if the senior designer rumor is true. How could a nicer designed HERO cam creates much more demand? I highly doubt it. Many other actions cams have better looking industrial design but yet trail GPRO sales by a lot. A few weeks ago this guy posted a video how Nick Woodman of Gopro is the next Steve Jobs. Over the next couple years you guys will see this all play out http://bit.ly/1N4EcPu I am sure Steven would feel it is a disgrace to compare Woodman to him. A trust fund guy helped by his dad's venture capitalist connection and spent days hangover on his luxury yacht. Not sure about this point in the US so feedback would be appreciated, but surely if Apple workers are granted patents while working for the company, they will belong to the company and not employees? Very exciting to see someone with serious design credibility come in house. GoPro produces great video but it is the ugliest, most clunky  looking box on the market. A sexier design sure would help marketing efforts. I'm sure this guy can help design expansion into new areas. I'd love to see them kick down the door in markets like police a military body cams.
