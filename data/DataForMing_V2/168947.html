Boeing And The $1 Trillion Chinese Market - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Investors should eyeball the economic growth in China, but should not fear the low growth. Despite lower growth rate of the Chinese economy, Boeing foresees robust demand. One of the countries that has captured the economic headlines for weeks now is China. The Chinese economy shows signs of decelerating growth and the government seems not to be able to turn things around and the fact that the Chinese government, which always is in full control, sparked fear among investors and resulted in a (predicted) major sell-off over the last weeks. Figure 1: Boeing 737 assembly line in Renton (Source: airchive.com ) Boeing (NYSE: BA ) presented its 20-year market outlook for China on the 25th of August while China captured the headlines day after day. Various news portals, including one linked by Seeking Alpha, reported that Boeing increased its market outlook for Chinese aircraft demand on the 25th of August. AeroAnalysis , familiar with Boeing's market outlook, begs to differ from what is written by various news outlets. First of all, what has to be noted is that Boeing did increase its outlook in June 2015. What happened in August was an annual presentation of the results for the Chinese market (just like it did for the Indian market ), but BA merely presented the results and reaffirmed the outlook during that presentation. The presentation with the bullish outlook for the Chinese aircraft market reached news headlines, due to the fact that the Chinese stock market was seeing strong declines at that very same moment. Secondly, it should be noted that the company already foresaw a decelerating growth for the Chinese economy. Some passages from the China market outlook also show this: Although a net beneficiary of low oil prices, China is experiencing slower growth, though at more sustainable levels as its economy matures. Over the next two decades, fast growth in China's domestic market will make it the largest domestic market in the world, and traffic within Asia is set to become the largest travel market. China is gradually reducing its rate of growth as it rebalances toward a more consumption-oriented economy. From the 3 passages, it becomes evident that Boeing actually already took into account low oil prices and slower GDP growth, yet the jet maker forecasts strong demand from the Chinese market. Boeing forecasts a 5.6% GDP growth per annum and forecasts demand for 6,330 aircraft valued at $950bn. Boeing expects the Chinese airline fleet to grow by 5.3% per annum while cargo activities will grow by 7% per year and passenger activities will grow by 6.6% per year. For investors, it is a bullish sign (for the long term) that Boeing forecasts demand for over 6,300 airframes while also taking into account slower economic growth. All in all, I do see Boeing's market forecast as a bullish sign despite concerns about short-term growth in China. Contrary to what is reported by some news portals, Boeing only reaffirmed the market outlook published in June. BA incorporated a slower growth on the Chinese market in its market outlook. With the expected lower growth rate, the company still values the Chinese aircraft market at nearly $1 trillion. On the short term, there will be some concerns about the Chinese economy, but given Boeing's history of providing accurate market outlooks, I think the long-term outlook is bright. For investors, the lower stock prices do offer a nice opportunity to buy in some shares for the long term. The fact that Boeing increased its annual guidance in June and reaffirmed its long-term guidance in August shows confidence in the market as a whole and does bode well for investors.
