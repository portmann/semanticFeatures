My Dividend Portfolio: Increasing My Verizon Stake - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha Verizon has proved to be a consistent, solid performer over an extended period of time, delivering good investor returns. I will be using Verizon as a "dividend anchor" in my portfolio given its solid 4.4% yield, above the average for my portfolio. Verizon's market position and customer base provides the company with a strong moat in the telecommunications industry, in my opinion. I am developing a passive income stream from dividends to generate financial independence. I'm proceeding down the path of steadily accumulating a set of high-quality dividend paying stocks. My strategy is to accumulate a basket of 30 wide moat dividend stocks quarterly . Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) is one of the businesses in my dividend portfolio that I am accumulating. Verizon is one of the largest telecommunication providers in the US, primarily providing fixed line and wireless telephony services to residential and commercial establishments. Verizon has a market capitalization of $204B with revenues of $127B and a gross margin in excess of 60%. Verizon generates a net income of almost $9.6B. Verizon currently trades at a forward P/E of 12.6 and offers a dividend yield of close to 4.4%. In brief, I am primarily looking for companies that have dominant moats and strong returns on equity, greater than 15%. I'm also looking for a track record of dividend increases and an average dividend yield of 2%. A full explanation for my filtering criterion for my portfolio can be found here . Verizon's wide moat stems from its dominant scale in the US telecommunications industry. Given the considerable fixed cost required to provide telephony service to subscribers, providers with dominant share are able to amortize cost of service across many subscribers, delivering service at lowest unit cost. Verizon derives a return on equity of close to 35%, well above my minimum requirement for inclusion in my dividend portfolio. Verizon's dividend has for the most part shown consistent increases over the last 10 years, satisfying my need for dividend growth consistency. The dividend yield comfortably exceeds my minimum threshold for inclusion. In fact, the yield is so generous that Verizon is an anchor position in my dividend portfolio. The company thus met my criteria for inclusion with my Dividend Accumulation portfolio. Consistent performer with good operating history Verizon has been in business since 1983, though its originating businesses have been in operation from many years prior. The operating performance of the company has been quite strong over a consistently long period of time. Verizon has increased revenues from $75B in 2005 to over $125B in 2014, representing an annualized growth of close to 5%. During this same period, operating income has increased from $14.8B to almost $19.6B, an annualized growth rate of almost 4.1%. Verizon's total return performance over the last 10 years has been reasonable and on par with the S&P 500. An investor who invested $10,000 in the S&P 500 10 years ago would have returned close to $21,000. The same investor in Verizon would have returned almost $22,500 over the same time period Verizon's moat is protected by high barriers to entry The barriers to entry for new wireless providers are fairly substantial. In addition to the regulatory hurdles of becoming a telecom provider, operators require access to expensive spectrum to operate a network, typically at a cost of billions of dollars. In addition, the provision of wireless service direct-to-consumer requires significant marketing, branding and investment in customer care and post-sales support. Any new carrier would require significant capital to set up operations and provide ongoing operational support. There has been much talk and speculation about Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Facebook's (NASDAQ: FB ) possible entry into the telecommunications market Facebook has been experimenting with free wifi for sometime now in local cafes in San Francisco. Facebook has also been active in exploring the use of high-altitude satellites to deliver cheap internet connectivity to developing economies, and it's recent purchase of Ascenta is a step in that direction. Google has also been active in exploring the use of cheap forms of connectivity to reach users. Google has been active in exploring wifi balloons to deliver low-cost internet access to remote areas. Finally, like Facebook, Google has also been active in considering promising satellite technology to deliver on the potential of cheap, universal internet access. Google recently purchased Titan Aerospace to further its ambitions in satellite technology. Additionally, the drones and satellite technology are currently focused on the delivery of cheap connectivity for the developing world, rather than in North America. I don't realistically believe that either Google or Facebook will be able to effectively replace Verizon as a primary provider of mobile connectivity and data access. For one, the reliability of a "mesh network" comprised of different types of coverage such as wifi or satellites and wifi balloons is fairly questionable. While users may be able to get sporadic connectivity from these services while mobile, it's unlikely to be significant enough to be a complete replacement for mobile connectivity provided by AT&T (NYSE: T ) or other carriers. Even if these technologies actually prove viable and commercially sound, both Facebook and Google will in turn have to operationalize service for consumers if they choose to go this route. That means proper pricing plans, customer service and a host of other supporting actions. I also don't believe that Verizon, or AT&T have much to fear from Google's recently announced MVNO efforts. It appears that Google's new wireless service would primarily leverage a range of wifi hotspots , with a fall back to cellular connectivity where suitable wifi is not available. While such a service will likely work without significant limitations when a user is stationary, it is likely to be fairly choppy when mobile. Assuming Google's ultimate play is to push more Google services and generate more mobile advertising revenue, it's highly likely that the scope of devices that will be offered by Google will be those that help maximize Google advertising revenue, meaning that non-Android devices won't be featured. This could put some natural limitations on the attractiveness of a Google wireless service. If Google's past efforts with a direct to consumer service are any indication, its wireless service will likely have significant bumps in the road. Google's attempt to sell its Nexus range of devices direct to consumers demonstrated a serious under-appreciation of the core competencies involved in direct to consumer sales and support. While Google can build up these competencies over time, it will need the ability to do this well, at scale and with national presence to be a real direct threat to AT&T and Verizon anytime soon. Much has been made of pricing pressures in the wireless industry, with aggressive promotions and deep discounting. This is not sustainable and should peter out over the next 12-18 months. Of note was that Verizon indicated that 2015 wireless EBITDA margins should at least be consistent with full-year 2014 margins, or around 48.5%, which suggests that Verizon expects pricing stability in 2015. What was also interesting was to note the recent Deutsche Telekom's comments about T-Mobile's (NYSE: TMUS ) pricing approach not being sustainable long term given a need to invest billions yearly just with no near-term prospect of sustained free cash flow. This is suggestive of T-Mobile's owner rapidly losing patience with such an aggressive pricing strategy with no near-term return prospects. Neither Sprint (NYSE: S ) nor T-Mobile is likely to have sufficient capacity in the tank to keep aggressive pricing measures in play for a sustained period of time. Sprint has not been able to generate meaningful free cash flow since 2012 and continues to lose subscribers. It is also faced with network upgrades that will occur over the next few years that will see cash flow bleed further. T-Mobile's aggressive pricing and subsidization of early termination fees has only had the effect of reducing the company's already marginal free cash flow. T-Mobile incurred large deficits in free cash flow in 2013, with 2014 also displaying a similar pattern. This is suggestive of the fact that neither Sprint nor T-Mobile will be able to keep discounting for a significant period while still investing to make necessary capital upgrades. Current penetration of US wireless connections is in excess of 100%, meaning that most households have greater than one device per member in the household. That places a natural limit on the extent of growth companies such as AT&T and Verizon can continue to enjoy, in the absence of connecting additional devices. Verizon has been making particularly good progress in driving machine-to-machine connections, which include such things as wireless-enabling vending machines, tablets, watches and wireless connected cars. Estimates indicate that Verizon likely has about 12-15M machine-to-machine connections. The progress Verizon is making in adding more connected devices is apparent in Verizon's quarterly results, with connected device growth increasing to 2.87 connections per account at the end of 2014, a growth of 4% from the 2.73 connections per account at the end of 2013. Why did I pick Verizon for long-term accumulation? The natural question arises as to why I've picked Verizon for long-term accumulation. Let's face it, Verizon isn't likely to increase its earnings or dividends much beyond the steady 2%-3% per year that it has managed for much of the last decade. However the fact that the company is a stable high yielder with a well protected dividend stream has great attraction for me and offers a few benefits. Verizon provides immediate guaranteed return. High-yielding dividend stocks provide you with cash in the bank today. They provide a real return and less of a promise of speculative return through capital growth, which essentially is the case with low yielding or moderate yielding stocks. The advantage to investors of a higher-yielding stock is they don't need to make bets on capital growth. They don't need to pick which stocks will experience strong capital returns and how quickly such stocks will be rewarded by the market. Verizon provides a nice shield against volatility. The company has a beta of only 0.45, meaning it moves approximately half as much in price as a general move in the market. Thus, when the market takes a precipitous dip, Verizon doesn't dip as much, in general. The inclusion of stocks like Verizon means I can also afford to have companies like Visa (NYSE: V ) and Mastercard (NYSE: MA ) in my dividend portfolio and still achieve reasonable dividend income today, while I wait for those stocks to achieve dividend growth status over time. It helps effectively underwrite the capital growth that these companies provide me, even though their dividend income remains low today. VZ is a key lynch pin of my dividend growth strategy and I find there is much to like with the company. A market leading position, stable dividend growth and solid yield help contribute to reasonable dividend income today, and help me invest in the dividend growth stars of tomorrow. Given I'll likely need my portfolio to produce dividend income to support me for as much as the next 50 years, this is something that's vitally important to me. I'm backing my conviction in Verizon to the hilt with ongoing regular accumulation. I currently have a $11,000 stake in Verizon, and I'm supplementing this with steady, regular quarterly accumulation. I feel that Verizon remains fairly priced and offers reasonable value here. Morningstar rates the stock at 3 stars, while S&P also rates it 3 stars. I most recently purchased VZ at $49/share, toward the end of March.
