Apple Investors Are Now Weighing The Impact Of Future Tax Increases - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Tim Cook fires back on taxes and doesn't have an answer on how the company will mitigate some of the impact. The tax issue is occurring on multiple fronts, which raises questions about whether Apple will continue to report its current tax rate going forward. The market is discounting the stock due to taxes, trouble with iPhone shipments, and weakening market sentiment. Given all of these factors, I remain bearish on company-specific fundamentals and find little reason to anticipate a recovery in Apple's valuation. Without product refresh and improvement to gross margins, the company's fundamentals will not recover. As such, I remain bearish on the stock. I guess one must begin to wonder when Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) will eventually confront international tax issues given its low effective tax rate (25.3% in FY'15). And yes, this issue of Apple mitigating taxes is somewhat politically contentious, which isn't really the nature of my article. However, what I do want to suggest is the reality that Apple's effective tax rate will eventually increase given the changing EU regulatory climate, which is another negative headwind facing Apple shareholders going into FY 2016. On 60 minutes with Charlie Rose, Tim Cook blew up with regard to the topic of international taxation. In a sense, I can understand Tim's frustrations because quite frankly no one wants to pay more in taxes, and he does have a fiduciary duty to shareholders to lower the tax bills whenever possible. Nonetheless, the issue of taxation has been looming over the heads of Apple shareholders for quite a while now and it's worth mentioning that Tim's response was somewhat juvenile when he said "that is total political crap" in response to Charlie Rose citing some of his notes. Of course, Tim could have gone into a more elaborate explanation on his responsibilities as a fiduciary, but instead he pulled a quick jab. Is it just me, or is the CEO of Apple starting to get more irate these days? He also fired back at analysts on the Q4 2015 earnings conference call as he denounced the conservative forecasted assumptions of every major investment bank analyst on the call. Not a really smart move. In fact, it prompted me to re-examine the credibility of Tim Cook as he's quick to criticize the products of other competitors and had even more optimism for the iPad coming out of FY 2014 than what was realistically warranted. Sure, we can acknowledge that Apple's CFO does all the number crunching, and he does a pretty good job. However, we're confronting a higher probability of weakening iPhone sales and full-product maturation given the broader weakness in handset shipment growth on aggregate. At this point, longer-term replacement cycles could become the new norm as I've encountered numerous people wanting to wait a while before replacing a handset. Of course, this is all anecdotal, but it's worth thinking about. Furthermore, these patterns have yet to be set in stone and could quickly change depending on the types of products Apple is currently developing in secrecy from the public eye. However, before becoming side-tracked on the topic of whether Tim Cook does have enough foresight to run the business, he does need to address to shareholders what additional steps need to be taken in order to address broader tax issues. The U.S. Congress is pretty incompetent so holding out for some tax break for money brought home seems like a fantasy we all dream about before we wake up the next morning. In a recent note from Credit Suisse they elaborate on broader international tax reform. I cite the highlights of the report: However, it looks like companies are facing a tougher tax environment and it's coming at them from a number of different angles, including: the OECD's effort to tackle base erosion and profit shifting; the UK's diverted profits tax (i.e., the Google tax); Ireland shutting down the Double Irish; the EU going after sweetheart tax deals; the Treasury department chipping away at inversions; tax reforms; disputes with tax authorities; negative media attention; public scrutiny; increased transparency; etc. But keep in mind even if the U.S. were to continue to sit on its hands when it comes to tax reform, U.S. multinationals would still be impacted by all the changes taking place overseas. It's simple, countries around the globe seem to be fed up with profits being shifted to tax havens and they could use some additional tax revenue. As a result, it should get harder and harder for companies to have their profits taxed in just the right low/no tax place (i.e., tax haven). In other words, Apple's tax rate will likely go up given their historical presence in Ireland and the usage of the Double Irish tax loophole. While, the tax rate has remained stable over the past couple years, I can't imagine Apple being able to mitigate taxes as effectively in years past. The company also mentions inside of its annual report that things have gotten a little tougher in Europe as of late. According to Apple's 2014 Annual Report: The Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number of the Company's subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The Company's future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S. and Ireland. For example, in June 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Ireland with regard to the corporate income tax to be paid by two of the Company's Irish subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. If the European Commission were to take a final decision against Ireland, it could require changes to existing tax rulings that, in turn, could increase the Company's taxes in the future. The European Commission could also require Ireland to recover from the Company past taxes reflective of the disallowed state aid. However, there is some good news as the Double Irish phase out period is six years, giving Apple until 2020 to fully maximize the tax code. On the other hand, Apple could end up owing taxes to the Irish government upon the full phase in. Thankfully Ireland has a relatively low corporate tax rate of 12.5%, but with the loop hole it was estimated that Apple was paying a minimal 2% tax rate. So the tax jurisdiction still offers some relief when compared to the United States. However, the sustainability of the current tax rate does put some pressure on Apple to sustain top line expansion, which I had alluded to earlier. The company needs to sustain a healthy top line growth rate to offset the impact as the OECD average tax rate is currently 25%, according to Credit Suisse analysis. Given Apple's international sales mix and Europe's 22% composition of the total mix (all international revenue is essentially taxed at a lower rate), I could imagine a 400 basis point impact on the corporate tax rate, which corresponds to 29.3% as opposed to the current 25.3% corporate tax rate. From what I understand, Apple should be able to maneuver earnings into Ireland, but I'm assuming that they can't report Irish earnings using the lowered provisions for royalty-based income. In other words, Apple may mitigate some tax increases going forward, but the effective tax it pays to governments around the world will likely increase. If I had to model my FY 2016 estimates using a 29.3% tax rate my EPS estimate would end up being $8.55, which would translate into a $99.29 price target. Now, I'm not changing my price target, but it seems the market is already pricing in the impact, as Apple will have to pay back the Irish government for owed taxes in future years. I continue to reiterate my sell recommendation and $103.50 price target. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
