General Motors: A Buy Or A Sell At $37? - General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) | Seeking Alpha General Motors reported a 2.4% decline in year-over-year U.S. vehicle sales for the month of March. This year-over-year decline compares to a 3.4% drop in vehicle sales for Ford Motor. General Motors has begun to outperform Ford Motor. It's that time of the month again when auto manufacturers release their eagerly awaited U.S. sales figures for the previous month. General Motors (NYSE: GM ) and Ford Motor (NYSE: F ) both released their sales numbers last week. Ford Motor's U.S. sales declined 3.4% year-over-year in March, but the auto maker managed to beat the consensus estimate nonetheless. I have commented on Ford Motor's latest sales results here . General Motors also had to report a year-over-year decline in vehicle sales, although the decrease in sales was not as large as the one for Ford Motor. In March 2015, General Motors sold 249,875 vehicles compared against 256,047 vehicles in the same month last year. That's a decrease of 2.4%. Retail sales declined 5% year-over-year to 182,710 vehicles. General Motors' March sales drop of 2.4% missed the consensus estimate of 0.1% growth. Year-to-date, however, the picture does not look nearly as bleak as the one painted by General Motors' March numbers: In the first three month of the current fiscal year, General Motors has sold 684,039 vehicles, which compares against 649,637 vehicles in the first three months of 2014. That's a 5.3% year-over-year increase in YTD sales despite the drop in General Motors' vehicle sales in March. The decline in General Motors' year-over-year March sales comes just after the auto maker reported strong growth rates at the beginning of the year. Just last month, General Motors reported 4.2% year-over-year sales growth in the U.S., which compares favorably against a negative year-over-year growth rate of 1.9% for Ford Motor. General Motors has been doing much better than Ford lately in the United States, which is also the reason why General Motors' shares have started to outperform shares of Ford Motor. General Motors' GMC brand is particularly successful right now. In March 2015, General Motors' total GMC sales increased 1.3% year-over-year to 41,707 and GMC retail sales grew 1.2% to 35,757 vehicles. These results are respectable in light of a total year-over-year sales decrease of 2.4% last month across brands, but they don't do justice to GMC's YTD performance. In the first three months of 2015, General Motors' sold 119,811 GMC vehicles, which represents a whopping 14.7% year-over-year increase, whereas GMC retail sales grew 13.0% year-over-year to 102,568 vehicles. GMC, at least for now, stands out as General Motors' fastest growing brand in the first quarter of 2015. General Motors has taken the lead in the auto industry recently by announcing a major capital return program that is defined by a $5 billion stock buyback and a 20% increase in its quarterly dividend. While Ford Motor's management could learn from General Motor's capital allocation initiative, both companies present outstanding value to long-term shareholders. General Motors trades at only 7.3x forward earnings and at a forward dividend yield of 3.9%. That's a bargain price by any measure. Ford Motor's shares trade at 8.6x forward earnings and have a dividend yield of 3.7%. The valuations of both auto makers therefore include a wide margin of safety, which makes a purchase of either General Motors or Ford Motor a no-brainer. General Motors is playing catch up to Ford Motor, which in my opinion is also excellent value from a 'cash return perspective'. General Motors might have lost some sales momentum in March, but the YTD sales story is very well intact here. General Motors' capital return program and competitive valuation certainly supports the bull case. Long-term Buy. Source: General Motors: A Buy Or A Sell At $37? Disclosure: The author is long F.
