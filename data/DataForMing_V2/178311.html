Yahoo ticks higher after IRS official comments on recent decision - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha To screen ETFs by asset class, performance, yield and more, check out the ETF Hub. ETF Hub Sep 21 2015, 12:46 ET | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor Though Alibaba is down 1.8% following its lockup expiration , Yahoo ( YHOO +1.1%) is higher after an IRS official stated his agency's recent decision not to grant Yahoo's request for a private letter ruling declaring the company's planned Alibaba stake spinoff meets its active trade or business (ATB) requirement isn't "a description of future guidance" (though he thinks it will lead to future guidance), and that "nothing in [the] notice affects an immediate retroactive date." FBR's William Bird (Outperform rating) calls the remarks "incrementally positive" for Yahoo. "The notice was characterized as a transitional 'stop gap' to explain the IRS’ thinking behind the no-rules, under which the IRS does not want to pass judgment on a transaction while it is studying the rules. We believe the IRS’ statements take one risk off the table (i.e. retroactive treatment of potential new rules), though anything shy of a definitive tax ruling on YHOO falls short of fully resolving tax uncertainties."
