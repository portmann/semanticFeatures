Disney Park Activist Play With 200% Return Potential - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Walt Disney took the Euro Disney shareholders for a painful ride. Their losses are close to 99%, while Walt Disney profited over $2 billion from the Park. Last year Walt Disney doubled its Euro Disney stake. Full delisting is now quite likely. Activist investors have launched a counter-attack to recover part of the proceeds. The unrecognized real estate portfolio valuation offers a downside protection for new investors. The activist drive and the Euro Disney 25 year anniversary sales push provide a 200% return opportunity. Editors' note: Euro Disney trades OTC in the US under ticker symbol, but with limited liquidity. There is more liquidity available under EDL.PA, the main ticker traded in Paris. Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS ) is a majority shareholder in Euro Disney (EDL.PA) ( OTCPK:EUDSF ), the operator of the Disney park near Paris. It is the number one tourist spot in Europe. Despite the high annual attendance, the park has not been making money. The park performance has been affected by its seasonality (cold winter) and higher French labour costs. But it has also been severely affected by DIS actions. DIS has been the only party that has been making money from Euro Disney. The DIS has been collecting $110 - 125 million in annual fees from Euro Disney. In total DIS collected from Euro Disney over â‚¬2 billion. But that is not all. Almost all park constructions have been done by DIS subsidiaries. The contracts are said to be quite rich and helped to improve DIS profitability further. All this is now a subject of litigation. The shareholders were laughing at the start Since the beginning, Walt Disney has been managing the park. It was a tough ride for its shareholders, who financed the park construction. Since 1990, the Walt Disney share price went up five times. During the same period, the Euro Disney share price went down by 99%. At the peak, the market cap of Euro Disney was at USD 3.3 billion. All that capital was burnt. After driving the park to the ground and wiping out other people's money, Walt Disney decided to step in during 2015. Through a capital increase, debt for equity swap and a tender offer for remaining shares the Walt Disney increased its stake in the park by 37% to 76.7%. The recapitalisation or, better yet, smart takeover took place in several steps: Capital increase - existing shareholders, could subscribe 9 new shares at â‚¬1 per each share they owned. The rights issue raised â‚¬423 million. Debt for equity swap - Walt Disney swapped â‚¬600 Million debt provided to Euro Disney for shares priced at â‚¬1.25. Tender offer - Walt Disney launched an offer for the remaining shares of Euro Disney at â‚¬1.25 per shares. After the tender, Walt Disney allowed the other shareholders to repurchase part of the tendered shares so that they can retain their stakes. When approving the tender offer, the Board of Euro Disney commissioned a fairness opinion from a French firm LEDOUBLE . In February 2015, the LEDOUBLE confirmed the fairness of the mandatory tender offer price of â‚¬1.25 per share. The offer resulted in litigation. The opportunity brought in the activist investor community lead by Charity Investment Asset Management CIMA fund . Besides the litigation on the offer, they do not like the fact, that while managing the park, DIS managed to burn $3.5 billion of other shareholder money while making around $110-125 million per year in royalties and fees and profiting from the park construction and maintenance. The core of the problems lies in the Euro Disney management. CIMA asserts that DIS maneuvered Euro Disney management into a clear conflict of interest. They might be motivated to act for the benefit of DIS at the expense of the other Euro Disney shareholders. As an example all Euro Disney employees are granted shares in Euro Disney, the management committee gets shares of Walt Disney. CIMA fund claims that shareholders were not told about the true value of the Euro Disney assets and the health of their business. The Fund is also demanding the repayment of â‚¬930 million ($1.05 billion) to Euro Disney, in repayment of "exorbitant" and "abusive" royalties and other fees paid to the U.S. firm CIMA filed a criminal complaint against DIS and Subsidiaries alleging misuse of corporate assets, filing false accounts and providing false information. A civil case against DIS subsidiaries, demanding the repayment of â‚¬930 million to Euro Disney, was filed in the Commercial Court of Meaux in October . CIMA is also appealing to the French Supreme Court against the approval of the Walt Disney offer to purchase Euro Disney shares by the French regulator. CIMA claims that the other shareholders were misled. In particular, CIMA criticizes the Euro Disney announcement from January 2015 (before the recapitalisation) that the attendance is expected to decrease by 2.6 million in 2015 and the earnings are expected to go down by 45% by 2023. These ominous expectations were the main declared basis Euro Disney making a provision against the park subsidiary and therefore for the whole recapitalisation. The results were quite different - the earnings went up by 25% on the previous year, and the attendance was up by 600,000 in the previous year. One could argue that such statements and actions could be a confirmation of the managementÂ´s conflict of interest. I have been in numerous litigations, and it is exactly such details that change the court's view on the matter. CIMA commissioned report by French valuer Thierry Bergeras that valued the company at â‚¬3.7 per share which is three times higher than the Euro Disney valuer LEDOUBLE. The major difference is related to the 2,230 hectares of land near the park that is partly developed and partly in development. Euro Disney expert firm appointed during the recapitalisation didn't value the park's land. I looked at the LEDOUBLE valuation commissioned by the board that is available on Euro Disney website. I have obtained the expert valuation from CIMA. Both valuers view that Euro Disney has two businesses: Tourism business (Theme Parks, Hotels, Disney Village, Golf course), etc. LEDOUBLE renders a fairness opinion to the board that the value of this business is around â‚¬1.25 per share. CIMA valuer does not assess the value of the Tourism business; it mainly concentrates on the valuation of the Real Estate Development Activities. The Real Estate Development Activities - construction of new installations for the tourism activities. These activities include management of land rights for 2,230 hectares containing Val dÂ´Europe urban centre as well as the ecotourism project Village Nature. LEDOUBLE believes that the value of this 2,230 hectares development business is immaterial. CIMA commissioned expert valuer establishes the value of the real estate development at â‚¬2.7 per share, excluding "Villages Nature" which is not valued at all due to insufficient information available. When you look at LEDOUBLE website, the headline states "Let your figures make sense! " In my humble opinion based on 17 years in investment banking, they did fail their mission on this occasion. In an agreement signed on 24 March 1987 between the public authorities and the Euro Disney companies, the EURODISNEY group was entrusted - for 30 years - with the development of a theme park and its surroundings on a site covering 1,943 hectares in Sector IV of the New City of Marne-la-VallÃ©e. Amendment 8 to this agreement, signed on 14 September 2010, extended the site coverage to 2,230 hectares in 10 districts and prolonged the agreement until 2030. Within the agreement perimeter, the public institution EPA FRANCE is in charge of acquiring and developing the empty plots. An option right provides for transfer to the EURODISNEY group at a fixed price of â‚¬1.69/m2 plus the cost of the secondary infrastructures and a 25% share of the EPA's structural expenses. There are two issues which could influence LEDOUBLE decision to value the assets in immaterial valuation: The options are off balance sheet. These property rights are only recognised on the asset side of the group's consolidated financial statements at the time of the acquisition of the plots. To be acquired, certain conditions need to be met. The options have a defined maturity. Non-fulfilment of certain conditions relative to the site's development can result in the extinguishing of the property rights.The CIMA valuation expert states on this: "Historically, the group has always used its real estate purchase rights by the agreement and its amendments, so as not to lose them. The group's 2014 reference document indicates: "to 30 September 2014, all minimum development deadlines have been met, and no real estate right has expired without being used". We, therefore, consider it highly likely that the purchase transactions will continue in the future for the entire contractual site." LEDOUBLE did appoint a real estate expert to carry out an independent review of the valuation of the real estate assets. LEDOUBLE provided no material results of its work. It only stated that "the recoverable value of the group's non-current assets is greater than their book value." As LEDOUBLE were rendering a fairness opinion, the amount of this surplus value should have been indicated in the LEDOUBLE report as part of using the Restated Net Asset Value method, which was not the case. CIMA valuation expert values divides the rights into two categories: Discounted value of the rental cash flows plus a discounted value of the residual value of the assets after the expiry of the lease. The land is leased to third parties who develop it and pay rent to EURO Disney over a defined period. After the period, the developed real estate ownership is transferred to Euro Disney, who would retain it, lease it or sell it. Capital gains on the land resale to third parties. Euro Disney group resells the land acquired under the option rights to third parties and recognizes capital gains on the transactions. The building lease contract involves, for the EURODISNEY group, having a third party build real estate assets on a plot belonging to EURODISNEY. In exchange for the operation of the fixed assets by a third party during the lease term, these structures are financed externally, and the lands are subject to a rent payment for the duration of the lease. At the end of the lease, the erected structures become the entire property of the EURODISNEY group, which can operate them, include them in a commercial lease or sell them at market value. CIMA experts took two actual transactions and extrapolated the achieved valuations to the other projects in the development plan. Based on such comparable transactions the value of that land is between â‚¬243 million and â‚¬383 million. As mentioned above LEDOUBLE makes no mention of this. VALUE OF THE REAL ESTATE PURCHASE OPTION The general development programme provides a specification of what is to be developed and where. These include a shopping centre, housing units, local shops, hotels, etc. The CIMA expert assesses the valuation by the location of the land and by its use. For each part of the land the CIMA, expert obtains land sales prices from the local land register database. Based on the actual prices CIMA expert assessed the average sales price for mÂ² of each type of land. Based on know purchase prices from EPA the expert determines the average capital gain from the sale of land in each district. The sales of land are assumed to take place proportionately over the period of the option maturity. The sales revenues are then discounted to Net Present Value at 4% Discount Rate. Based on the above methodology the fair value of the real estate purchase option contractually granted to the EURODISNEY group at â‚¬1,888 million to 31 March 2015. After reading both reports, I find it hard to understand why the LEDOUBLE experts choose to assign an immaterial valuation to the asset class. The CIMA valuation expert provides the following summary: To 31 March 2015, the Restated Net Asset Value, therefore, amount to: the net situation of â‚¬690.7 million capital gain of at least â‚¬2,131 million (243 million plus 1,888 million discounted deferred tax assets of â‚¬87 million Resulting in a restated Net Asset Value of at least â‚¬2,908.7 million, which corresponds to â‚¬3.7 per share. As mentioned above the â‚¬3.7 per share valuation does not include valuation of Villages Nature due to insufficient information available to CIMA commissioned expert valuation. The size of the project is significant - it includes 1,210 recreational cottages and 520 apartments built on 180 hectares. The value of the project is undoubtedly material and therefore â‚¬3.7 per share valuation is most likely on the lower end. Today, the shares trade at â‚¬1.24 per share. The free float is 13.3%. At current market price, the free float is â‚¬125 million, which is less than the annual income DIS makes from Euro Disney. It is irrational for DIS not to take Euro Disney private. It is just a matter of time. Given the above valuation of the real estate business, it is unlikely that Euro Disney freeze-out offer would go below the current â‚¬1.24 per share. Meanwhile, 2017 is the 25 anniversary of the Euro Disney opening. The management is planning new attractions and a big PR sales push. The performance is likely to improve, which might drive the valuation higher. The two points above should serve as a downside protection for investors. CIMA is trying to establish, that the contractual arrangements between both companies have been abusive and is seeking for return of â‚¬ 930 million taken out by DIS. The amount is equal to current market capitalisation of Euro Disney. If granted the Euro Disney would benefit from returned cash as well as amended business model that would change the profitability of the company for the future. It is difficult for an outsider to assess the likelihood and magnitude of success of a litigation case. We specialize in litigation investments. This story reads well. Notorious French dislike for Americans is also an issue to take into consideration. We have concluded that likelihood of success is material and the risk reward quite attractive . We have made a significant investment. We see a bright outlook for Euro Disney shareholders ahead. Disclosure: I am/we are long EDL.PA. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
