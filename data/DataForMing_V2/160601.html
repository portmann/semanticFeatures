Ford August Sales Crush Expectations - It's Time To Buy - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford delivers 5.4% sales growth for August, beating expectations. Industry factors and vehicle demand are both driving growth for the company. Amidst fears of a China slowdown and another day with the markets covered in red, Ford (NYSE: F ) delivered some good news to investors, absolutely crushing analysts expectations with a year-over-year gain of 5.4% for the month of August. Ford was not alone, with Fiat Chrysler posting a 1.7% gain, despite predictions of a decline, and maintaining its 65 month streak of monthly sales gains. GM (NYSE: GM ) also beat expectations, declining 0.7% y/y, which was much less than analysts' expected. However, Ford was the real show-stopper. Going through the data, we see that Trucks really powered Ford ahead, with the segment growing 11.3% y/y, primarily driven by the new F-150. F-Series delivered its best August sales results since 2006, increasing almost 5%, with the F-150 EcoBoost representing 63 percent of F-150 retail sales in August and growing 86% y/y. For months, limited supply led to double-digit declines in the F-150 sales, but now that production is ramping up to full capacity, the demand for these vehicles is clear. And keep in mind, the F-Series alone accounts for over 30% of all vehicles sold in August, making up the bulk of Ford's revenues, so this is a critical sign of strength for the company. Vans also reported phenomenal growth at 70%, making it Ford's best August Van performance since 1994, and SUV sales grew 12%, the best August sales performance for the Ford brand SUV lineup in 12 years. These gains are even more impressive when you consider that Labor Day sales are not counted in August this year, as it falls later on the calendar. This is the most critical point to understanding just how strong sales were in August - Labor Day weekend is a huge sales weekend for car manufacturers and dealers, and for the past several years, it has been included in August. So the comparisons were really tough to beat because the previous numbers included the sales and volume of Labor Day weekend, while the current ones do not. I believe this point also addresses the issue raised earlier today by another article , that highlighted total YTD sales as still being below 2014's sales numbers (495K vs 497K). Although it is technical true that 2015 is still lagging 2013 & 2014 YTD sales, I believe YTD will show positive year-over-year growth once the Labor Day weekend sales are included for this year (in next month's data). So how exactly did Ford (and others) manage to exceed expectations without their key weekend? Two reasons: oil + credit. Without a doubt, cheaper gas prices had to have played a role in the August sales beats we're seeing from several companies, finally providing a positive side to the collapse in oil prices and the energy sector that has been such a drag on the economy. The strength seen in larger vehicles sales (trucks, SUVs, etc.) supports this idea, as these segments powered not only Ford, but also Fiat, which saw strong growth from Jeep and Ram. The other piece of the equation is most likely increasing access to credit and better financing terms for consumers, at least in the auto sector. The combination of lease deals, loans extended from the traditional 5-year terms to 7-years, and increased subprime lending all help to manage the monthly payment for customers. I believe this smaller monthly payment size will likely continue to be a tailwind to the industry in general over the next few quarters, even as the Fed moves forward with its plan to raise rates. Overall, this was a stellar month for Ford sales, and September promises to be even better. Furthermore, the solid monthly sales data from Ford, GM and Fiat provides another positive data point for the economy. Taken together with the positive data coming out of the housing market , you can see that the U.S. economy is continuing to move in a positive direction. This will benefit all auto makers, however, Ford seems to be capitalizing on it the most, due to the strong demand for their vehicles, particularly the F-series trucks. I believe Ford will outperform as these trends continue, yet the stock continues to sell off with the broader market. It is now trading below 15x earnings, and sports a dividend yield well over 4%, making it an attractive buy for opportunistic investors.
