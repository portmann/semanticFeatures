BRCM, STM, ADI, IDTI, SNDK, MU land Apple Watch design wins - Broadcom Corporation (NASDAQ:BRCM) | Seeking Alpha To screen ETFs by asset class, performance, yield and more, check out the ETF Hub. ETF Hub May  2 2015, 15:42 ET | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor iPhone/iPad combo chip supplier Broadcom (NASDAQ: BRCM ) is providing a Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/NFC/FM radio combo chip for the Apple Watch (NASDAQ: AAPL ), according to an ABI Research teardown of the Watch's S1 chip module. As expected, NXP supplies a complementary NFC controller. The teardown also uncovered a 6-axis STMicroelectronics (NYSE: STM ) motion sensor (accelerometer/gyproscope). There has been some debate about whether InvenSense (NYSE: INVN ) will be a motion sensor supplier for the Watch, as it is for the iPhone 6. Analog Devices (NASDAQ: ADI ) supplies a touch controller IC. Barclays reported in March ADI had scored multiple design wins to enable Apple's Force Touch pressure-based response feature (supported by the Watch) on future iPhones/iPads. IDT (NASDAQ: IDTI ) supplies a wireless charging IC. The design win comes after Samsung opted to use a Texas Instruments charging IC within the Galaxy S6; IDC supplies a chip for the S6's charging pad. Dialog Semi ( OTC:DLGNF ) provides a power management chip. SanDisk/Toshiba (NASDAQ: SNDK ) supply an 8GB NAND flash chip, and Micron/Elpida (NASDAQ: MU ) a 4Gb (512MB) SRAM chip. SRAM typically carries higher ASPs than DRAM for a given amount of capacity (it's also faster). In the near-term (and perhaps longer), Watch volumes will likely amount to a small fraction of iPhone volumes - whereas Apple sold 192.7M iPhones in 2014, IDC forecasts 15.9M 2015 Watch shipments, and more bullish estimates are still generally in the ~20M range. However, strong growth is expected over the next several years, and the first-gen Watch serves as a valuable reference win when competing for other smartwatch/wearable designs.
