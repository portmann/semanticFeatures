Stop Buying Amazon's Magic Beans - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha As an investor, profitability is the most important thing. In spite of doubling their market cap this year, Amazon hasn't shown strong profits. (click to enlarge, original artwork by HextupleyOodot , Deviantart) Trees do not grow to the sky, folks. Beanstalks only do in fairy tales. It is a long drop down from this point. It's been a good amount of time, but I have been bearish about Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) before. I have a notorious Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) posting that I made two Christmas seasons ago in the "Value Investing" group, mentioning that I thought the stock was expensive: Here's a link to that thread . It's notable to me because there are a subset of individuals there responding to that posting that I have the utmost respect for, and they were telling me that I didn't understand the business well enough. But just two days after posting that, the stock proceeded to lose a quarter of its market cap, taking the stock down over the next year: Here is what I understand about businesses All businesses. And I consider this to be the most important thing. A business needs to be profitable to justify investing in it. In my opinion, they shouldn't even go public if the company doesn't have a history of earning money. Why seek expansion if you are running an unprofitable company? That only transfers the burden of your failures to other people. Most people wouldn't call Amazon a failure though. Speculators certainly wouldn't look at the stock price, now having doubled over this year to date, and think there was anything wrong. Profits. Over the last ten years, the most Amazon has ever made in any one year was $2.53 per share in earnings. This year to date, they have only made 24 cents. The company's twelve trailing month price to earnings ratio is over 920. Nine hundred and twenty times trailing earnings. Even if you used their very best year, the company still trades at a ridiculous premium of 253 times earnings. At the point where I said to sell before, they were 158 times. That was on a multiple of earnings from 2010, their best year to date. Nothing since then was even close. I will give you that revenues increased by double, but so have their interest expenses, and on the balance sheet, their long-term debt has tripled. If you think there is any chance at all of interest rates increasing in the future, that is going to be a serious problem for Amazon to deal with at the point that they need to refinance this debt. Amazon and the art of distracting shareholders Sure, the company has been making investments in its infrastructure. Analysts have been praising Amazon's cutting-edge cloud computing tools, for example. But earth to analysts: Amazon is not in the cloud-computing business. International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM ) is. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) is. Alphabet is (NASDAQ: GOOG ), (NASDAQ: GOOGL ). Facebook and Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) sort of are. But not Amazon. They sell stuff. Books, toys, electronics, all kinds of things. Real, physical things that have to be stored somewhere, that have to be shipped places. Those operations cost money. I wanted to draw that distinction, and the connection to these tech companies, because when I went out looking for opinions from traders who were buying this stock, they told me that they put it in the same group as tech stocks, and that if all of these other tech companies are doing great, it must therefore be somehow true that Amazon is also doing great. Jeff Bezos, the company CEO, is a brilliant, visionary, and respected individual, and when he talks about the future for Amazon, and the infrastructure he is building, he is inspiring. But then he also says things like this: "There are two kinds of companies - those that work to raise prices and those that work to lower them." So in that sense, Amazon is at odds with itself See, by taking on this additional debt, this vast infrastructure; Amazon is painting itself into a corner. Technology is cool, but it's an operating cost to maintain it, and the only thing your competitors have to do to keep up with you is buy the same technology. If you are constantly working to lower the prices of the goods you are selling, can you see why that might be a problem? Amazon gets the attention they do because of the cash flow that they generate, which, to their credit has been growing very fast. But it all comes down to maintaining that revenue stream. There are a finite number of customers that Amazon has the ability to service, and at some point, they will reach that maximum limit. Revenues would taper off there, but all of these expenses would both remain and require costs to maintain. If they are constantly working to lower the price of the goods they are selling, then each future customer, by definition, becomes less profitable. The technology they employ, instead of becoming less costly, just becomes obsolete over time and has to be replaced. Employee wages tend to rise over time as well. When a management builds this kind of reputation for being brilliant, but the economics of the business aren't in their favor, well, I think you may have heard this before. Tesla Motors (NASDAQ: TSLA ) is like that too. Their CEO, Elon Musk has a reputation now as a visionary, and he has gone and said things about the competition now that force them to deliver on certain promises. Those promises cost money to deliver . Amazon may be a thorn in the side of Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) lately, but perhaps if Wal-Mart were able to do something for their business other than upgrade the technology; say, for example, improve their public image by improving the appearance of their stores , and raising the wages of their employees , they might just be able to gain their edge back here. I like closing with that heading, because at the bottom line is where your profits are. When you buy stock, what you are really buying is partial ownership, and a share of the profits that a company earn. Sooner or later, the company will hit that growth limit I mentioned earlier, and a whole lot of money will exit when investors realize it has happened. You might think you're ahead of the game by setting a stop-loss order in preparing for that day, but Amazon has an average trading volume of over 4 million shares a day. Imagine what would happen if 4 million "sell" orders hit brokers simultaneously. Retail has been a pretty tough segment to be in this year, but when you can buy ownership in other companies that are earning 5 times the amount of profits, for 1/10th the price of Amazon, then sooner or later, the other shareholders are going to notice that. It is my hope that you are not left holding the bag when that inevitably happens again. Because in the end, everybody likes paying a lower price.
