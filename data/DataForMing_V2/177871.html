Google Can Develop And Distribute Free Software To Block Ad-Block Users - Google Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) | Seeking Alpha Google has the money to bribe all developers of ad-blocking software to whitelist its ads. Google can also create a free software for website owners to detect and block ad block-using site visitors. I am not an iOS or Android developer but I do understand the dynamics of online digital advertising. Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and its advertising/content-marketing clients will not let the new Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iOS ad-blocking feature affect their livelihood without a fight. Other contributors here at Seeking Alpha keep on harping about a mobile catastrophe for Google because of Apple's recent move to support browser-based ad blocking. However, I am well aware that a majority of websites, whether accessed from phones or desktop PCs, is dependent on advertising income. The digital advertising industry mafia is not a pushover that will bend down for Apple or any ad blocking advocates. The iOS platform has been a gold mine for Google and it will not surrender easily so that a few million users of the iPhone/iPad can browse ad-free websites. Google's management will be remiss in its duty if it lets app developers sell $1 ad-blocking Safari extensions and just do nothing to protect its multi-billion mobile search advertising on the iOS platform. The millions of website owners and content marketers will fight tooth and nail to preserve their advertising clicks/views. They can allocate and pool resources to create a software to defeat the makers of ad-blockers. They can bribe the developers of ad-blocking browser extensions to whitelist their ads. They can also hire the experts who can block the ad-blockers. Sourcepoint is a new start-up created by a former Google executive that wants to help companies defeat the annoying problem of ad-blocking browser extensions. People who bought ad-blocking browser tools from Apple's app store will find it very frustrating when a site they try to visit starts blocking them from accessing the site's contents. Detecting users of ad-block on mobile Safari browser is easy to do. I bought the $0.99 Crystal ad-blocker and tested it on the small hackintosh.zone site. That ads-dependent site immediately detected Crystal and blocked me from accessing its contents. Apple is playing with fire with its open support for mobile ad blocking. The long-term risk is that content publishers, creative professionals, advertising agencies, and other employees dependent on advertising could take offense. There is the tangible risk of a long-term backlash that many people might boycott Apple Macs, iPhones, and iPads as way to protest Apple's overt act of promoting ad blocking. Google Should Aggressively Fight Against Ad-Blocking Hiring anti-ad blocking experts and/or bribing ad-blocker developers are unnecessary burdens to website owners. Third-party ad-blockers on Safari are just a nuisance that Google could easily eliminate. Google should develop and give away free software that will help websites automatically detect and block any iPhone/iPad user who use ad-blockers. Google makes so much money on digital advertising that it could afford to give away free software. Advertisers and content publishers will benefit from Google's future giveaway of a free anti-ad block tool. In exchange, they will remain loyal to Google's mobile advertising platform and will continue to ignore Apple's iAD. In spite of its $200 billion cash hoard, Apple is unlikely to improve iAD as a real alternative to the mobile advertising services of Google. Unless Tim Cook allows the same intrusive or full access to personal data of iOS device users (like Google and Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) do right now), iAD will remain a poor choice for digital advertisers who love hyper-targeted personalized ads. In spite of the huge number of iPhone/iPad users, iAD is still a non-factor in the mobile advertising industry. This is precisely because advertisers are turned-off by Apple's continuing refusal to fully share personal data. The concept of hyper-local, hyper-targeted ads is to deliver ads based on 100% profiling of a particular person's web and mobile activities. I am long AAPL and I support its idea of giving iPhone/iPad users the choice to block or not to block ads. However, I am not ignoring the potential long-term backlash from angry creative design professionals, advertisers, and content publishers who suffer from ad blocking on iOS devices. There are creative people like me who could be very vindictive. If I am the owner of a big content site like iMore or Hongkiat and Apple is helping greedy third-party developers reduce my advertising income, I will be stupid not to boycott Apple's software/hardware products. Furthermore, trying to use browser-based ad-blockers as a ploy to try and steer online publishers/advertisers to its News App is a bad strategy for Apple. While the News App would remain immune from ad-blockers, iAD still remains a poor choice for advertisers who want 100% access to personal data of target audience. Google is the undisputed giant of digital advertising. Apple should avoid picking a fight against a champion colossus in an area where it has repeatedly failed. The combined might of Google and its global advertising partners/content marketers will steamroll over a bunch of for-profit ad-block developers. Google is rich enough to bribe any developer of ad-blockers to remove their apps from Apple's iTunes store. Google can also easily buy Sourcepoint and distribute free software to help websites identify and block the people who use ad-blocking software. I do not think Tim Cook will allow 100% access to personal data of iPhone/iPad users to iAD advertising clients. Apple should therefore just take the billions of annual payments that it gets for making Google the default search engine on desktop and mobile versions of Safari.
