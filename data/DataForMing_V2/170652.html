Apple Products: Revolution Or Evolution? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha A common meme is that Apple has lost its ability to create revolutionary products. We examine the meaning of revolutionary vs. evolutionary products. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) investors have watched or read about the latest release of new products: Minor enhancements to the Apple Watch, and Of course the press has had a field day with this with more articles on the topic than on the Queen of England. There is both praise and deprecation. One big criticism that many raise is this: This is a common meme, as expressed by MacDailyNews reader Fred, who commented : Apple's latest products are evolutionary not revolutionary. Apple reached its zenith with Jobs, now we witness Apple's serene journey into predictably staid keynotes and unimaginative mediocrity. (Let us assume that Fred is not merely a troll relishing in his ability to stir up the Apple faithful, and really believes what he writes - in spite of the fact that his last sentence suggests otherwise.) In any case the sentiment is common. Some headlines: On Friday (11 September) 24/7 Wall St. wrote : The fact that Apple trades so far below the high is an ongoing indication that Wall Street worries Apple has not released a revolutionary product recently. So we can see this has become a popular meme. To the investor this is of importance because it implies that Apple's leaders no longer have the ability to innovate in any meaningful way, and this would be disastrous as Apple maintains its leadership precisely because of its image as an innovator. Any change in the pace of new products, or even just in this image, will affect sales growth and therefore earnings and share price. The 24/7 Wall St. article referenced above notes that Apple: …ranks seventh among most shorted stocks on Nasdaq based on the total number of shares shorted. I would like to examine this issue. Are Apple's revolutionary products behind it? Is it forever doomed to merely evolve its once revolutionary line? Has it lost all ability to innovate? To understand this issue, we need to discuss just what is a revolutionary product. What is revolutionary is very dependent on one's perspective, particularly if one is taking a close view or a 50,000 foot level view. That is to say, that which is "revolutionary" is relative to context, and subject to opinion. To a certain degree, nothing technological is revolutionary. Everything in science and technology builds on all that preceded it. In the bigger picture, most of what has occurred in tech is only evolution. One of the most revolutionary products of all times, in 1938 physicist Chester Carlson invented Xerography which led to the Xerox 914, the first successful commercial plain paper copier (introduced 1959). Xerography is a process by which an image projected onto a metal plate is charged and can pick up dry toner to be deposited on a piece of paper. Nothing vaguely like it existed before Carlson's invention. Yet even this brilliant innovation was an application of physical science principles that had slowly developed over centuries. The first PC was an extension of the first microprocessors (such as the TMS 1000 by Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN ) and the 4004 by Intel (NASDAQ: INTC )), and these were extensions of the transistor. All personal computing technology grew, or evolved, out of this. From this level of view, real revolutionary products might include the transistor itself, the Xerox machine, Dan Bricklin's VisiCalc, and the computer mouse originally conceived by Douglas Engelbart. From this point of view, even the iPhone can be considered nothing more than the natural evolution of computers as empowered by ever increasing computing power and miniaturization along with the application of several new technologies (e.g. touch screens). Yet the iPhone is generally considered to have been revolutionary. It totally transformed the cell phone landscape and put real computing in a person's hands. The tactile interface has become the standard for all other smartphones. While Apple may have invented few of the underlying technologies (such as touch screens) the overall product combined so many in such original ways that it was a completely innovative - hence revolutionary - product. So where does evolution leave off and a revolution begin? That, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder. The personal computer revolution began in earnest in 1977 as the first truly successful commercial personal computers were launched. Some might credit Apple's Macintosh, the first successful commercial computer with a Graphical User Interface, as being another revolution. The iPhone also should be called revolutionary as it differed so much from all that came before it and completely changed the industry. So, again, the investor needs to evaluate the concept that Apple can no longer create revolutionary new products as this potentially affects future growth. Frequency of revolutionary technology If you look at the products discussed above, each one was introduced precisely at the time that core enabling technology became available: The Mac required processors sufficiently powerful to drive the graphics and other technologies The iPhone required touch technology and the miniaturization of microprocessor and a whole slew of other technologies (cellular data, battery technology, wifi, etc.) So, when one complains that Apple has no longer created any revolutionary new products since Jobs died, one could argue that truly revolutionary products require major advances in technologies that only come around every 30 years (1997 to 2007). One good example of the importance of this concept is the evolution of the PDA. Apple came up with the Newton, one of the first PDAs to use pen input with writing analysis. One of the major problems was that the processor was never really sufficient for the task. Additionally, all the other components were so large that the product was cumbersome. And so the Newton was produced before the core hardware technologies were ready. Eventually it died, but others, notably now defunct Palm, picked up where the Newton left off, and, with later technology, were able to produce more usable products. So the problem here is really one of unrealistic expectations. Some people think that Apple should be able to create some revolutionary new product every two or three years. This just is not possible. Currently we are in a plateau, waiting for some breakthrough new technologies, perhaps some direct connection to the brain. If you see the Apple Watch as being merely evolutionary, than what could possibly be created that would surpass it? No one has any answer to that. Oddly, those who criticize Apple for not creating something revolutionary enough seldom have any ideas for what that might be. Another serious problem that Apple has with its products is under-appreciation of the technology. Customers may be delighted with say an iPhone, and the overall product is definitely valued (Apple products have exceptionally high customer satisfaction ratings), but few really appreciate the incredible work that goes into design/engineering of various features, be they software or hardware. Apple is a bit like a great dancer who is so good she makes it look easy. Apple products have such a naturalness to their use that customers never think it could have been so painstaking to create that. Think of the scrollable lists in iOS. A flip of your finger sends it "rolling" upwards, gradually slowed by the force of "friction" or "gravity," and finally coming to stop with bounce if at the end of the list. Just coming up with that concept was demanding enough. Then implementing it in a way that it appears so "natural" required months of critical testing and reworking the code. Now we have an extraordinary piece that gives us a little insight into the process and reveals just how difficult product or feature development really is. Josh Tyrangiel has written for Bloomberg an exceptional piece on the topic. Focused on the new 3D Touch feature on the iPhone 6S phones, it also give a great overview. "Ultimately, this is our focus," says Jony Ive, squeezing a new iPhone 6S. "This is what galvanizes our efforts right across the company." And 3D Touch, he adds with emphasis, "is something we've been working on for a long time-multi, multi, multi years." Apple has succeeded precisely because it has always focused on ease of use for all of its products. This dedication is still alive and well. Note Ive's emphasis on "…multi, multi, multi years." It is truly extraordinary the amount of effort Apple is willing to invest in developing a technology. A few more takeout quotes from the article. (DO read it all!) "Engineering-wise, the hardware to build a display that does what (3D Touch) does is unbelievably hard," says Schiller. "And we're going to waste a whole year of engineering -really, two - at a tremendous amount of cost and investment in manufacturing if it doesn't do something that (people) are going to use. Ive is proud of 3D Touch because it improves the experience of owning an iPhone, but he's also proud of what it says about Apple. He can't think of another company that would have put so many resources into such a seemingly subtle, yet potentially profound, change. Apple's faith in design helped make it the first company to reach a market cap of more than $750 billion. It also means that every few years it has to bet its future on the instincts of a few people with strong opinions about how things should work. So, whether 3D Touch is revolutionary or only evolutionary, it is hardly "staid" as described by Fred, and leads to important differentiation on the part of Apple products that will allow it to continue its privileged position in the smartphone market. The same is true for the slew of other new features, both software and hardware, that are gratuitously written off by detractors. One of the astounding things about Apple is not just the products themselves, but what they enable. If you watch the demo for the doctor app Airstrip for the Apple Watch presented by Dr. Cameron Powell, you will see something truly amazing. On the wrist, a doctor can bring up live readouts of patient monitoring equipment. Additionally, expectant mothers can do monitoring tests at home, and upload them to the physician. (Demo begins approximately at the 6:20 mark in the presentation .) Several problems exist with the claim that Apple no longer produces revolutionary products. What is or is not "revolutionary" is very subjective. Truly revolutionary products may come around only once in thirty years. New features that are "merely evolutionary" (Touch ID, 3D Touch, Apple Watch, A9x processor, etc.) may still be highly creative, groundbreaking and very significant to Apple's product positioning. No matter how popular the false meme to the contrary may be, Apple is continuing to innovate, most likely more rapidly than ever. There are indeed many potentially detrimental challenges that Apple faces, but the lack of innovation is certainly not one of them. Those who avoid Apple stock for this reason will likely miss out on further growth of the company, of earnings and of the share price. Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL.
