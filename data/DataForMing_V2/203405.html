Amazon's Leverage Of Existing Customer Base Should Win Out In Japan - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha L&F Capital Management , L&F Capital Management (456 clicks) This culture shift from DVD loyalty to streaming acceptance will assist both Amazon and Netflix as they make excursions into the formerly unfriendly Japanese market. Amazon's ability to leverage its pre-existing online retail customer base in Japan will serve as a significant competitive advantage over Netflix in an already adverse market. This leverage coupled with a significant cost advantage and more diverse content offerings will make, in our opinion, Amazon the preferred streaming service in Japan. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) are set to roll out their respective video streaming services in Japan in the coming weeks. Both companies will be hoping for stronger debuts than competitor Hulu saw in 2011 . Hulu never achieved much success in Japan as it lacked original content and the exposure needed to overcome the country's loyalty to DVD rental shops. Times in Japan, though, have changed. According to Shin Unozawa, former Bandai Entertainment employee and current chair of the Computer Entertainment Suppliers Association and CEO of the Anime Consortium Japan, the DVD rental shop culture in Japan has peaked . According to Unozawa, the inevitable transition to streaming media has finally begun. This culture shift from DVD loyalty to streaming acceptance will assist both Amazon and Netflix as they make excursions into the formerly unfriendly Japanese market, and we believe that the two figureheads of streaming contents will be able to generate brand-recognition synergies to create awareness that Hulu was unable to create four years ago. As such, we believe both companies will find more success in Japan than Hulu did in 2011. On the onset, however, we affirm that Amazon has the upper hand in Japan. We believe Amazon's ability to leverage its pre-existing online retail customer base in Japan will serve as a significant competitive advantage over Netflix in an already adverse market. This leverage coupled with a significant cost advantage and more diverse content offerings will make, in our opinion, Amazon the preferred streaming service in Japan. Firstly, here is a quick synopsis of how Amazon Prime will function in Japan. Existing Amazon Prime members in Japan already paying for free shipping and other Prime benefits will begin to receive the video streaming service at no additional cost. New users will be able to sign up for Prime membership, with video streaming included, for the same price of roughly $32 per year. Netflix, on the other hand, will be releasing its streaming video services for roughly $5.49 - $12 per month, which equates to an annual rate of $65.88 to $144. Netflix will be offered to Japanese customers as 2x to 4.5x as expensive as Amazon. It's important to note that Amazon's $32 per year service is inclusive of free shipping on orders through Amazon.com. In addition to a significant price advantage, we believe Amazon's ability to leverage its pre-existing online retail customer base in Japan will serve as a significant competitive advantage over Netflix in an already adverse market. As can be seen in the graphic below with data collected from SimilarWeb.com, Amazon.com receives 1.03% of its global web traffic from Japan. With 6.076 billion visits worldwide in the last six months, that means Japan accounted for 62.582 million unique visits in the past 6 months. Annualized, that is roughly 125 million Japanese visits to Amazon.com per year. That makes Amazon the seventh most visited website in Japan and the most visited shopping website in the country. For comparison purposes, video streaming rival website Hulu is the 50th most visited. Netflix.com is not among the top 50 websites in Japan, nor should it be as services have yet to be launched in the country. Netflix will be attempting to penetrate the market as an entirely new service, much like Hulu was four years prior. Although the climate has certainly changed some in four years, Japan is still a more adverse market for streaming than the United States, and we believe an entirely new service like Netflix could have trouble with customer adoption. Moreover, Japan provides more than just 125 million visits to Amazon.com per year - the country also provides arguably the most active user base on Amazon.com. As seen below, Japan's average visit duration is the longest among leading countries at 10-plus minutes per visit. Pages per visit are 10.18, second to only the US. Its bounce rate also is among the lowest, meaning its users interact with most pages they are led to. Amazon already has a large and engaged customer base in Japan, and we believe Amazon can leverage this customer base to make Amazon Instant Video the preferred streaming service in Japan. Making this leverage easier will be Amazon Buy/Rent, which diversifies Amazon's video offering capabilities and better suits some of Japan's favorite movies. According to Box Office Mojo , some of the highest grossing American films in Japan include Frozen, Maleficent, Amazing Spider Man 2, Godzilla (2014), Transformers: Age of Extinction, Edge of Tomorrow, The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug, and Noah. Titles such as Noah and Transformers: Age of Extinction are available streaming on both Netflix and Amazon Prime. Other titles like Frozen, Maleficent, Amazing Spider Man 2, Godzilla (2014), Edge of Tomorrow, and The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug are not available via either subscription. However, these titles are all available for streaming to either buy or rent on Amazon. Some of those titles also are available on Netflix DVD. Amazon's Buy/Rent feature diversifies the platform's product offerings and gives Amazon, as a whole, far more streaming content than Netflix, specifically content that has found popularity in Japan. While some of this content is not available through a Prime subscription and instead costs extra money to buy and/or rent, the content is still instantly accessible (unlike Netflix DVD) and we believe there is an advantage in the consolidation of content in one place. Despite the advantages we believe Amazon possess in a Japanese market, it's important to note that long-term winners cannot be determined with high conviction at this point in time. Netflix has already announced a deal with Japanese-based Fuji Media Holdings, giving the company access to content which should appeal to Japanese audiences. Through this, Netflix will be exclusively offering new episodes of the "Terrance House" and "Underwear" series. While Amazon hasn't revealed in detail much of its plans yet, we believe they should and will follow suit. It also should be noted the possibility of the services successfully coexisting remains viable as many users in the US enjoy the different offerings from both companies. The Japanese video streaming industry has proven a tough market to crack, but we believe the synergies from the strength of both brands will bring forth much different results than what Hulu experienced in 2011.
