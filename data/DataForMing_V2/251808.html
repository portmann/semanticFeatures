Apple: Why An Inferior iPhone Made Sense For 2015 - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Seeking Alpha contributor Sean Chandler states Apple's margins are out of touch with reality. An iPhone upgrade to base storage is all but guaranteed in 2016. On Monday, I read a nice article from fellow SA contributor Sean Chandler, who argued that Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) high margins were out of sync with reality . Sean argues that high margins are earned, not taken, and that Apple must upgrade the storage of its base model iPhone in 2016 or face considerable customer backlash. While I agree with the premise of his article, I believe there are extra factors in play that need to be examined. As Sean accurately points out, 16GB of storage is not enough in today's world. Operating systems use a few gigabytes themselves, apps take up plenty of space, and if you are interested in gaming, the 16GB model just doesn't work. According to TechInsights , the 16GB flash storage drive in the iPhone 6 cost just $7.55, so it's not a tremendous cost for Apple to upgrade the base model to 32GB. With an average selling price of about $670 in its latest fiscal year, you're talking about a little more than 1% of the ASP of the phone. By the time Apple launches the iPhone 7 (expected in September 2016), the cost to go from 16GB to 32GB might be even lower if flash prices continue to decline. So why did Apple launch a 16GB base model in 2015, if the company is so interested in premium products? Well, getting consumers to spend the extra $100 to go to the 64GB model was definitely part of the plan. This helps the company's top line, and obviously improves margins since the larger storage model probably costs less than $25 but you're paying an extra $100. In my opinion, there were two concrete reasons why Apple went with this inferior iPhone. The first item I would point to is the potential for a double whammy in terms of margins with the 6s models. Apple made some significant upgrades for 2015, which likely increased the cost of the phones, so adding another $7 or so to the phone's cost was not likely in the budget. The addition of Force Touch resulted in a slightly larger phone, so Apple was really launching a new form factor this year, which usually isn't seen with the "s" line. Apple also made a big camera upgrade to the 6s, upgraded the processor, and doubled the memory ("RAM"). Had Apple thrown in the extra 16GB to the base model, it would have likely resulted in many consumers buying the 32GB model, resulting in $100 less revenues per phone as well as the added cost of the extra storage. Management probably did not want to take a big margin hit on this "s" line upgrade, especially with so many new products/services launching this holiday period. I believe Apple will launch a smaller iPhone in early 2016, which probably will be lower margin than the normal iPhone. As of Monday, the average estimate on Wall Street was calling for Apple EPS to rise by less than 7% in fiscal 2016 , and a large chunk of that improvement will come from the company's massive buyback. Had Apple started the iPhone with a 32GB base model, we would have likely seen very minimal EPS improvement or perhaps an EPS decline. That's not a situation management wanted to see, because it certainly would have fueled the already increasing Apple bear camp. Using an inferior base model this year allows Apple to upgrade to a 32GB entry level phone next year, when the company may not have a larger form factor as MacRumors currently states (a thinner iPhone 7 is expected). The hardware upgrades probably won't be as dramatic for next year's model, so Apple won't have to worry about the cost of the iPhone increasing as much as this year's model. That allows the company to have a softer landing with the extra flash storage cost, keeping margins a bit steadier over the long term. Management doesn't want to repeat the margin situation from fiscal 2012-2013 seen in the chart below, one of the reasons why shares of the company cratered during that time. The second major reason I believe Apple used the 16GB model is an effort to promote its upgrade program. For those consumers that did go with the entry level version, they will probably jump to the 32GB model as soon as then can next year, which will start to shorten the replacement cycle of the iPhone. When you are selling roughly 230 million smartphones a year, reducing the average replacement value by even a few percent can add millions of phones sales per year. With the iPhone's strong margins, this not only boosts Apple's top line but pads the bottom line as well. Helping the upgrade program also would give Apple an adequate supply of 6s model phones that can be refurbished and used to target lower income growth markets. Like many, I've discussed the potential opportunity Apple has in India, and having a supply of lower priced phones for this market seems like a good idea. As I detailed in my 4-inch phone article above, early sales in India of current models seem weak because pricing has been high. A lot of this is due to the sharp rise in the US dollar, so a cheaper phone would likely see increased demand. In the end, Apple made a very logical decision to keep the 16GB model as its entry level iPhone for this year's lineup. With a number of major hardware upgrades and a slightly larger form factor, the company didn't want to add the extra cost of flash storage, while keeping consumers buying the more expensive higher storage models. This allows Apple to upgrade the base model to 32GB in 2016, when the company is likely to make less meaningful and less expensive upgrades, keeping long-term margins a bit more stabile. Also, this can help the company with its iPhone upgrade program, lowering the phone's replacement cycle and adding an inventory of refurbished phones that can be used to target growth markets. Apple did a good job of protecting its margins with the iPhone 6s line, and I ultimately believe that will translate to a higher stock price when the results come in.
