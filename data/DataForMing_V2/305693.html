Intel As A Premier Security Provider - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I am/we are long INTC, IBM. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. In a recent research report Forrester said that IoT security technologies are still in the creation phase. Intel Security has changed its strategy to combat the growing threat of Ransomware-as-a-Service, and similar threats. In the wake of the Internet on Things revolution, the magnitude of online security threats is growing rapidly. Device makers are more concerned about launching new products and less about security. Market research firm Forrester believes the IoT ecosystem needs to solidify itself in order to maintain privacy and security. In a recent research report it said : Most hardware and networking IoT technologies have hit the Growth phase or even the Equilibrium phase. IoT software is in the Survival phase. But standards are nascent, as vendors are only a couple of years into the process of creating general-purpose interoperability standards. And IoT security technologies are still in the Creation phase, with no established products. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) acquired McAfee, a provider of security products and services, in 2011. McAfee now is a part of Intel Security. To combat the growing threats of ransomware along with "Ransomware-as-a-Service" business model, McAfee is continuously strengthening its security product platform. Ransomware-as-a-Service is aimed at offering inexperienced cybercriminals threat service, such as sending ransomware. In this article I will try to assess the commercial viability of Intel's security push. Cybercriminals raise money in the form of ransom by sending ransomware to enterprises. They first steal confidential business information, business strategies, employee usernames and passwords etc. and then promise to return that information against lofty ransom. They could seek to exploit IoT and cloud services in order to increase the number of attacks. Cybercriminals take the advantage of increasingly complex and fragmented IT infrastructure of enterprises. To combat against latest form of security threats, Intel Security has changed its strategy by moving towards an entirely new direction. When McAfee was independent, it used to provide protection via offering customers traditional security products, such as endpoint and network security, web and email security, security analytics etc. However, the company found that instead of providing protection, building an end-to-end solution around an attack's life cycle would be more beneficial for customers. Intel Security's new strategy is narrowing focus on endpoints and cloud control points. This new strategy aims at protecting the corporate networks which are accessed through remote devices. It has launched two solutions for this new approach, viz., McAfee Endpoint Security 10.X and McAfee Active Response. However, Intel Security has sold off its Stonesoft firewall business to Raytheon Websense, a Texas-based cybersecurity firm, because the business wasn't compatible with the approach. McAfee grew up as a security product company. Many security professionals still think that McAfee is just another antivirus vendor. However, Intel Security is trying to change this perception by transforming the company to a provider of Security-as-a-Service. The Security-as-a-Service business model works by offering enterprises subscription-based security services. This ensures a continuous flow of revenue for Intel Security, and for clients it's a cost-effective way to fight cyberattacks. Intel Security is aiming at developing a robust security ecosystem around its new "protect, detect and correct" strategy by integrating third-parties with the evolving Security-as-a-Service platform. The company's biggest competitor is Symantec (NASDAQ: SYMC ). But IBM's (NYSE: IBM ) IBM Security is fast emerging as one of the most sought-after security service providers for enterprises. I believe that going forward IBM Security will become Intel Security's biggest competitor, replacing Symantec. Since IBM has a loyal customer base, building a Security-as-a-Service platform and integrating it with its existing software ecosystem will be easier for IBM. IBM Security's X-Force threat intelligence team, which is its R&D department, is developing a security platform that targets IBM's existing enterprise customers. IBM offers managed security services to its existing customers as well as new customers. Since Intel is not a software company, building partnerships with third-party software companies is essential for developing a security ecosystem. Recently Intel Security has expanded its partnership with VMware's (NYSE: VMW ) enterprise mobility subsidiary AirWatch for broadening the ecosystem to include mobility. In 2015, when VMware and Intel Security teamed up for integrating their respective technologies for making the software-defined networks more secure, the ecosystem began to develop. Now it remains to be seen whether Intel can beat IBM with its new approach. Intel's advantage is that its security offering starts from chip-level. Intel's TXT (trusted execution technology) is a hardware technology which uses cryptographic techniques for combating software-based attacks. TXT prevents enterprises from cyberattacks which are designed to work by corrupting system and/or BIOS code. IBM's SoftLayer was the first cloud vendor that adopted Intel's TXT for offering customers TXT-supported bare metal virtual servers. This indicates that Intel's security push has huge revenue growth potential in the long run. Security-as-a-Service is a fairly new concept. As it continues to evolve, the demand for security services will rise. The creators of ransomware, such as CryptoWall, CryptoLock, ZeroLocker etc., operate by encrypting hard disk contents, and then demanding ransom. To prevent such threats, chip-level security is an absolute necessity. Intel is the only company in the world which has the potential to offer such security. Tagged: Investing Ideas , Technology
