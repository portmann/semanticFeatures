Apple to delay live TV service to next year: Bloomberg | Reuters Customers enter the Apple store on 5th Avenue beneath an Apple logo in the Manhattan borough of New York City, July 21, 2015. Apple Inc (AAPL.O) will delay its live TV service to at least next year, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the iPhone maker's plans. The company had planned to introduce the service, which is delivered over the Internet, this year. Discussions with broadcasters such as CBS Corp (CBS.N) and Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O) to license programming are progressing slowly, and lack of content has led Apple to scrap plans to announce the service at a Sept. 9 event, Bloomberg said. Apple also lacked the computer network capacity to ensure a good viewing experience, Bloomberg said. ( bloom.bg/1MmYAbm ) The company still plans to introduce a more powerful version of its Apple TV set-top box at the event, which will be held in San Francisco. Apple was aiming to price the new service at about $30 to $40 a month, media reports have said.
