Amazon contends that the sellers use one of two methods to raise the profile of their products on the site: create their own positive reviews by way of fake accounts, or pay others to praise their products. With the cases, Amazon is seeking to ban the sellers from using its site to peddle their products or accessing Amazon services in the future. The complaints also ask for the profits the sellers made on the site, attorneysâ€™ fees, and damages exceeding $25,000, TechCrunch reports. While Amazon has previously said it had filed lawsuits against more than 1,100 people who posted fake reviews for cash and began suing companies offering such reviews in April 2015 ,Â the company is attempting to get at the root of the problem by targeting merchants to pay for the reviews. â€œOur goal is to eliminate the incentives for sellers to engage in review abuse and shut down this ecosystem around fraudulent reviews in exchange for compensation,â€? the company said in a statement.
