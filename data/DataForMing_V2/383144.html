Apple: TSMC Points To iPhone 7 Strength - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha TSMC expects flat revenue growth in the first half of the year. TSMC expects a significant upturn in the second half, especially for its most advanced 16 nm FinFET process. Following TSMC's (NYSE: TSM ) 2016 Q1 earnings report , Bloomberg ran an article with the headline , Apple Supplier TSMC Sees Demand Waning for Phones Above $500. Bloomberg may have quoted TSMC out of context, as well as ignored TSMC's very bullish outlook for the second half of calendar 2016. TSMC clearly expects a very significant bump in revenue due to Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) next iPhone 7. As we get closer to Apple's earnings report on April 25, investors are being treated to a host of supply chain rumors. In addition to the supposed "warning" by TSMC about iPhone sales, there is the Nikkei report that iPhone sales will remain "slow" through June. And now Morgan Stanley has warned of a potential delay in iPhone 7 due to the earthquake in southern Japan. Sony (NYSE: SNE ) manufactures iPhone cameras in the Kumamoto prefecture affected by the quake, and it's thought that delays in camera deliveries could lead to consequent iPhone 7 delays. Bloomberg has reported that Sony had to halt production at the plant. The impact of the rumors has been to drive down Apple's stock by about 4.5%. After Apple guided lower for the March quarter (a y/y decline of 9-14% in revenue), this was seen by many as a vindication of supply chain rumors. As I pointed out in my article on Apple's December quarter earnings, the rumors didn't prove to be very good quantitative predictors of Apple's financial performance. At best, they were a qualitative indicator, which I was by no means disposed to ignore. I'm still trying to find good quantitative predictors in Apple's key supply chain partners such as Hon Hai Precision (Foxconn) ( OTC:FXCOF ) and TSMC. Here, my philosophy is to focus on key suppliers and manufacturing partners, rather than commodity chip suppliers, on the assumption that the key suppliers have better visibility into Apple's plans beyond the current quarter. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., one of the biggest suppliers of chips to Apple Inc., forecast second-quarter revenue well below analysts' estimates as demand for smartphones priced above $500 peters out. I watched the earnings conference video, as well as read over the transcript, and my conclusion is that TSMC was not trying to say that high-end smartphone demand is petering out. The Bloomberg article appears to quote co-CEO Mark Liu out of context. Here's the full exchange between an analyst, Mehdi Hosseini of SIG and Mark Liu, starting with Hosseini: Historically you've had more content in high-end smartphone but the growth rate for low to mid range is much higher than the high-end smartphone growth rate. Would it be safe to assume that if the growth rate for the low to mid range is offsetting lower growth rate for high end, even though the high end gives you higher content? It's possible. We see the over- TWD500 phone is reducing, but the $400 phone is increasing quickly. And both high end and mid end silicon content are increasing with high single digit. But the unit of the mid-end phone increases and high-end unit number decreases this year. What exactly Liu meant may be open to interpretation. Part of the problem is that we're dealing with people who aren't perfectly fluent in English. Was Liu referring to smartphone unit shipments in the industry as a whole or to unit shipments of TSMC's product wafers for high-end smartphones? Did Liu mean that unit sales of processor wafers for high-end smartphones will decrease in absolute terms, or merely that the unit growth rate will decrease? I'll try to get clarification on this from TSMC before Apple's earnings report next week. Even if TSMC expects wafer shipments for high-end smartphones to decline in 2016, that isn't necessarily a statement about Apple's sales expectations. Compared to last year, high-end smartphone processors might be expected to decline due to the loss of Qualcomm's (NASDAQ: QCOM ) business for the Snapdragon 820 fabrication to Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ). As far as I can tell, that leaves only Apple and Huawei as "high-end smartphone" customers. TSMC is known to fabricate the Huawei's custom Kirin 850 SOC used in the flagship Huawei Mate 8 smartphone. While Bloomberg focused on Liu's statement, it ignored a much more bullish statement by TSMC's other co-CEO C.C. Wei. Once again, the context of the question Wei was answering needs to be understood. TSMC reported revenue of $6.3 billion for Q1 and guided to revenue of $6.7-6.76 billion for Q2. This was pretty much flat y/y for the first half. Yet TSMC reiterated its full year revenue growth guidance of 5-10%. At the high end of the growth range, this implies that H2 revenue will be 22% higher than the previous year. Analysts were naturally curious to know what would be the big growth driver in the second half of the year. Analyst Rick Hsu (Daiwa) asked about this: About your second-quarter guidance, I think it looks to me it's a bit below seasonal in terms of sequential growth momentum. And you also mentioned that the demand is mainly from the 28-nanometer, 40- and 65-nanometer, not much for the 16-nanometer. And you also mentioned that your 16-nanometer for this year, the full-year revenue contribution will come to above 20%. Can I take that as a -- your Q3 momentum is going to be really strong and likely above seasonal? Actually the high-volume ramp we expect in the second half of this year is for the 16 FinFET. That's because of leading-edge or the high-end smartphone. And other applications actually in the 16 FinFET continues on and we saw a lot of tape-outs since last year. So the momentum accumulated and I believe in the second half of this year we will see higher growth. This isn't an unqualified statement that Apple will drive growth in the second half. Clearly, TSMC has other customers for 16 nm FinFET, not the least of which is Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ), which is expected to start delivering consumer graphics cards based on the Pascal architecture, fabricated by TSMC on 16 nm. But the timing certainly strongly suggests that Apple will be a major contributor to revenue growth on the 16 nm node, since it will need a production ramp of processors in Q3 to support the launch of a new iPhone 7 sometime in the September time frame. TSMC looks particularly well positioned to benefit from the new iPhone launch, since I doubt that Apple will split processor production between Samsung and TSMC as it did last year. TSMC's statements regarding its InFO technology also appear to bear very strongly on its relationship to Apple. InFO is a packaging technology that allows for the combining of multiple silicon substrates in a single package. Apple's SOCs for the iPhone and iPad already take advantage of combining RAM and processor within the same package. InFo promises to take that a step further by combining other functions as well. TSMC's statements about InFO strongly imply that it's only working with one major customer right now, and that customer is likely to be Apple. So I think chances are very good that InFO technology will be used on the next iPhone. What are the benefits? Potentially, lower cost, higher performance, and thinner design for the iPhone. The purveyors of supply chain rumors have a pretty easy job of it right now. Does anyone think that Apple won't see y/y declines in unit shipments of the iPhone in the March quarter? Until the iPhone 7 comes out, there isn't much to catalyze sales, and it's very apparent that the iPhone 6s just hasn't developed the kind of momentum that the iPhone 6 had going into the new year. In the mean time, Apple's competition has gotten tougher, with a number of phones featuring the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor, which I have noted is superior to Apple's latest A9 in some ways. These phones have included the U.S. version of the Galaxy S7, as well as phones from LG, HTC, and Xiaomi. At the very least, Apple investors are looking at an iPhone sales decline for the March quarter, and probably June as well. This will embolden the Apple bears, and probably lead to more share price declines. I believe that investors should be on the lookout for a bargain in Apple shares sometime in mid-summer, very similar to what we saw last year. I remain long Apple.
