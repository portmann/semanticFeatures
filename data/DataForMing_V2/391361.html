Quintiles Is A Buy - Cramer's Lightning Round (4/26/16) | Seeking Alpha Apple cutting price of the Watch will not impact Fitbit. Palo Alto Networks (NYSE: PANW ): Weakness in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) will bring tech stocks down. That is the time to buy Palo Alto keeping 2017-18 in mind. General Cable Corp (NYSE: BGC ): It has good yield and the business is fairly straight. Fitbit (NYSE: FIT ): Cramer has been wrong on Fitbit before, but he likes the stock for the long term. He thinks that Apple cutting the price of the Watch would not impact Fitbit as it is an ecosystem on its own. Quintiles Transnational Holding (NYSE: Q ): "You know I like Quintiles. You need them to be able to get your drugs through the FDA." TG Therapeutics (NASDAQ: TGTX ): "Speculative stocks aren't working." Stay away. Boston Beer (NYSE: SAM ): They did not have a good quarter. Cramer favors Constellation Brands (NYSE: STZ ) (NYSE: STZ.B ).
