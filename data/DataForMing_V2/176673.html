I Scream, You Scream, We All Scream For ... Streaming? - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Bret Kenwell , Future Blue Chips (19 clicks) Sep. 18, 2015  4:36 PM ET  |  About: The Walt Disney Company (DIS) , Includes: CBS , CHTR , CMCSA , DISH , FOX , NFLX , VIAB by: Bret Kenwell Streaming has certainly gained momentum in recent years. That leaves traditional TV down, but not out. Streaming is cheaper for the minimalist, but hard to justify for those who like sports and/or plentiful entertainment. There's been plenty of concern among media stock investors, as streaming services and skinny bundles appear to be at a tipping point. That's why stocks like Twenty-First Century Fox (NASDAQ: FOX ) (NASDAQ: FOXA ), CBS (NYSE: CBS ) and Viacom (NASDAQ: VIA ) (NASDAQ: VIAB ) are down 30%, 22% and 39% on the year, respectively. Even the beloved Disney (NYSE: DIS ) fell more than 20% from its highs before rallying back above $100 per share. The main argument against traditional TV is that it's really expensive and consumers are paying for a bunch of channels they don't want or need. Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) starts at $7.99 per month for streaming , which includes hit shows like "Orange Is The New Black" and "House of Cards." A service like Hulu has more recently-aired television shows, like (Disney's) ABC's "Modern Family" and (Comcast's (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) (NASDAQ: CMCSK )) NBC's "The Tonight Show," and also starts at $7.99/mo. A big draw back for some cord-cutters is the lack of sports viewing. For fans of single sports (like football or hockey), they can consider live out-of-market products like Sunday NFL Ticket or NHL GameCenter. If you're a college football fan or basketball fan, you can watch ESPN. The most economical way I've found for this is Dish Network's (NASDAQ: DISH ) Sling TV, which costs $20/mo., and includes networks like ESPN, ESPN2, TNT, ABC Family, AMC, History and more. The biggest problem with purchasing sports networking separately is the live out-of-market games. For the all-around fan or someone who doesn't live near their favorite team, that's no problem. But for fans looking to watch live in-market games, it's a definite drawback. While cutting down to skinny bundles does make sense for some consumers, it doesn't make sense for all consumers. Rather than replacing their current TV setup, a lot of consumers complement it with services such as Netflix. That's why I think TV is down, but not necessarily out. I'm not saying I'm bearish on Netflix or that cord-cutting doesn't have momentum; it certainly does. Just look at the number of subscribers that Netflix has added, growing its subs from 50 million in Q2 2014 to 65.5 million in Q2 2015. It's very impressive, no doubt. But for many people, it's just not economical enough to actually cut the cord if it means giving up what they truly want to watch. Case in point, if you're a big sports fan, it could cost you more to get those packages back in a cord-cut world. So how do you play this? In the grand scheme of things, I go back to the old line, "content is king," meaning I like content companies. Investors can side with companies that are both cable and content providers (think Comcast), but I'm shying away from those that rely solely on providing the service. My top pick here is Disney. On the media side, Disney has networks like Disney Channel, ABC and perhaps most importantly, ESPN. The networks received among the highest marks from consumers , meaning demand is strong. Disney is popular among children, but live sports is the real linchpin here. Sports is also an important driver behind networks like Fox and CBS. According to Disney CEO Bob Iger, 96% of all sports programming is watched live, which is "particularly valuable in today's rapidly changing advertising marketplace." As much as hit TV shows help boost viewership in the short-term, they do not bring the kind of consistency to the table that sports do. TV series provide content companies with some additional income, as they often find their way to streaming services. Iger called Netflix "more friend than foe" as it is an "aggressive" buyer of Disney's content, highlighted by the recent talks for Netflix to start offering "Star Wars" in Latin America. When viewership falls, so do ad revenues. That hurts content companies, especially on traditional TV services which are losing popularity. That's why Wall Street is re-rating these stocks in the form of selloffs, as traditional TV is suffering due to alternative viewing services. This only underscores why high quality content is all the more important. Quality content always has a buyer, while live sports helps to stifle the loss of ad dollars. Last quarter, excluding the Men's World Cup in 2014, ad revenue actually increased for Disney's ESPN. This shows that live sports programming is anything but dead. And it's why I think Disney is the cream of the crop among its peers. It hits big categories on the TV (comedy, adult, children, sports), and then has diversified businesses like consumer products, parks and resorts, and studio. Investors know streaming is gaining steam, but they also know it's not the be-all, end-all answer to traditional TV. There will be a point of equilibrium between the two-ways-to-watch categories and I think that balancing point is what investors are trying to pinpoint. If you've been waiting to take a position in some of these stocks, now may be the time. In particular, I think Disney at or below $100 is a great deal for long-term investors. Without getting into the company's other businesses -- which include upcoming catalysts like the new "Star Wars" movie and its new theme park in Shanghai -- its media pipeline remains strong. While it may have been slowed, the business is still doing well, and I think the 20% drop in Disney shares more than prices in the current environment. Disclosure: I am/we are long DIS.
