Boeing: The Real Dreamliner Challenge Starts Now - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Ramp up in cost efficiency will determine fate of the Boeing 787. Looking at the average required (postive) cash flow Boeing is facing a huge challange. In an article published on the 22nd of March, I had a look at Boeing's (NYSE: BA ) financial performance regarding the Boeing 787 program. The first goal for Boeing was to reach a cash positive status on the Dreamliner production which has been reached in Q4 2015. A next interesting thing to look at is whether the current accounting block of 1,300 aircraft is big enough. What has to be noted is that this is not an indication of break-even point. However, if Boeing does not at least cover the deferred costs it means the program would be in a reach-forward loss position. In this case investors should be notified, this did not happen and I do not think that currently Boeing is nearing that position. If we rule out the forward loss position, there are 2 scenarios: Boeing ramps up profits in such a way that it draws total program profit before the end of the accounting block Boeing is able to ramp up profit in such a way that it will at least break even on the program after 1300 deliveries To be safe, in this analysis scenario 2 will be dealt with. In this article I will have a look at how much cash Boeing needs to make in order to (at least) reach the break-even point. Because this scenario can become more complicated when more and more details are added I will start off with a simple analysis that is based on the already realized results without looking at what is likely to happen. In future pieces I will be adding more details, but this article should be seen as building block. Figure 1: Total deferred costs Boeing 787 Program versus deliveries (Source: www.AeroAnalysis.net ) As can be seen there is a hole of about $32bn that the Dreamliner needs to climb out. Up to and including Q4 2015 Boeing delivered 382 airframes. If we were to express the deferred costs on a unit basis it means that on average each Boeing 787 bled about $85 mln in cash. Figure 2: Total deferred costs Boeing 787 Program (smooth) versus deliveries (Source: AeroAnalysis.net ) In order to make the general trend better visible, the data has been smoothed. It looks like the deferred costs are about to bottom, but are not quite there yet. For simplicity I will gear my calculations as if the current $32.4bn in deferred costs is the bottom and Boeing will draw the same profit over all remaining aircraft in the accounting block. Figure 3: Total deferred costs Boeing 787 Program (smooth) and required profit versus deliveries (Source: AeroAnalysis.net ) Currently the accounting block is 1300 units. Out of these 1300, 363 airframes already have been delivered to customers. This leaves 937 airframes in the accounting block to recoup all costs. If we translate this to a unit basis, each Dreamliner that rolls out of the factory now has to draw a $34.6 mln profit. This is quite a task given that just like cutting costs, ramping up profit is an incremental process. This means that Boeing has to draw profits in excess of $34.6 mln on later airframes to compensate for lower profits on earlier profitable deliveries. It is difficult to verify numbers, because Boeing does not open up about profitability, revenue and manufacturing costs for its aircraft. On the Boeing 777-300ER margins were around 35%. Using this figure this gives a positive cash flow between $40 mln and $50 mln. Going for a more conservative 30%, this gives a positive cash flow of around slightly less than $40 mln. So in theory it is possible to cover all, but in reality there lies an incredibly big challenge ahead for Boeing. On paper, it is possible for Boeing to recoup the costs within the given accounting block. However, a lot depends on Boeing reaching a production rate of 12 per month (144 deliveries annually) in mid-2016 and ramping up production by the end of the decade. For investors the first milestone to eyeball is actually reaching the bottom of the hole that Boeing dug for the Dreamliner, after that is up to Boeing to show how fast it can ramp up profit on the earlier profitable deliveries. A few things that will help Boeing in vastly decreasing deferred costs are relatively high deliveries of Boeing 787-9s and the Boeing 787-10.
