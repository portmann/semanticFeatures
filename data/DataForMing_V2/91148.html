Yahoo Is Finally Progressing In Its Turnaround - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha Focus has been on the Alibaba stake, but Yahoo's core business may start to finally show signs of improvement in the coming quarters. The pace of layoffs has rapidly accelerated. Data driven improvements in products may also get revenue to start growing again. The latest news on Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) has mostly focused on the potential for its Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) spinoff to be fully taxed, or at least partially taxed. This has caused a great deal of panic for Yahoo investors, and the stock has been punished as a result. In the chaos, some promising signs for Yahoo's core business seem to have been missed. One of the biggest criticisms of Marissa Mayer's regime has been that Yahoo had too many employees, and still has too many employees. Yahoo finally seems to be addressing those concerns. In the first quarter Yahoo had an 1100 loss in net employees. This is a massive acceleration from the pace of firings before, given that Yahoo has 2800 fewer employees from when Mayer was hired (nearly three years ago). Additionally, there are signs that Yahoo will be continuing to slim down its work force, given that they recently announced that they would be shutting down several different services. Having fewer products to support brings down operating costs in the form of labor and other services, such as bandwidth. Also, this increased focus will be positive for Yahoo shareholders and users alike, as Yahoo can re-focus their engineers and other staff onto their core products - their MaVeNS (mobile, video, native and social) products, making these better and more competitive. The question of course remains - why would Mayer start reducing costs now, rather than implement them before? After all, the first step of any traditional turnaround is to slim down costs. Part of the reason is likely to be investor pressure, but there likely is another (hopefully larger) reason as well. Yahoo has always been a bit of a special case in terms of a turnaround. It wasn't about to go bankrupt, based off of its Alibaba stake alone, so management could afford to be smarter about the way they implemented the cost cutting. Software development is highly specialized work - one employee might be able to do things that a hundred other ones combined can't. That's why having talented employees really is critical for a technology company, so just firing people might actually hurt a turnaround effort in the long run. Additionally, it's very hard to attract talent when you have a reputation for firing people. You need to be able to discern who's really good and who's relatively "bad", and that takes time. Part of discovering who the relatively bad employees were came from a much-criticized stack ranking system that Mayer implemented. Honestly I think stack ranking is generally harmful, and all the research shows that it usually is, but if you believe that your company overall had a lack of engineering talent, (as Mayer seemed to believe when she came in) the best way to get rid of your lowest performing employees is through this sort of system. I think that it's likely that this stack ranking system will end soon, and that'll be a positive sign for the turnaround. One of the best examples of the results of mass layoffs at a technology firm can be seen at IBM (NYSE: IBM ), which began in 2012, essentially as soon as Rometty ascended to the position of CEO. Not only is IBM's stock price currently lower than it was back then, but their revenue and net income has also continued to decline significantly since then. This is what many investors wanted Yahoo to do, and I think it would have been a terrible mistake for their long-term financial performance, and bad for morale. Other positive signs come from a recent talk that Mayer gave. I understand that some investors don't trust her words, given that the turnaround still hasn't seemed to materialize yet, but in this case, her words do make sense. She talked about how Yahoo did a lot of experiments in terms of products and data collection in 2014, and they are now starting to implement what they learned to improve earnings. This is a positive sign, and ideally will help with the secondary aspect of any turnaround - growth in revenue. Moreover, she soothed investor fears over more acqui-hires, talking about how Yahoo was now more focused on "big strategic building blocks," in terms of hiring. I think that the next few earnings reports will continue to show significant drops in headcount and improving earning metrics. The market will especially start to pay attention to these once the spin-off of Alibaba is taken care of. Of course, the question of whether the spinoff of Alibaba will be tax-free or not is still an issue when it comes to investing in Yahoo. Given that the IRS announcement was made after Yahoo submitted their spinoff plans, it seems more likely than not that the Alibaba spinoff will be approved. However, the odds are more along the lines of 50-50 or less that the Yahoo Japan stake will be tax-free, given that the spinoff for that was not submitted until after the announcement. However, Yahoo remains somewhat undervalued regardless of whether this stake is taxed. Their Alibaba stake is worth roughly $33.5 billion right now, and they have around 5 billion dollars. The Yahoo Japan Stake is worth $8.2 billion. Their current market cap is $38.4 billion. If both the Alibaba stake and Yahoo Japan stake are taxed at 35%, they will have 32.1 billion dollars in terms of cash. This means that Yahoo will have a P/E in the mid to high single digits, and a P/S of around 1. If the turnaround is finally starting to occur, then such low valuation metrics are not justified. If the turnaround does not materialize like I believe it will, then such a valuation is likely to be fair. Of course, the value of Yahoo will probably immediately drastically decline if it is announced that the spinoffs will not be tax-free. In the long-run, (after the spinoff) this will likely be corrected, given that Yahoo will trade at a ridiculously low P/E, after accounting for the value of the spun off company. Conversely, if the IRS announces an approval, Yahoo stock should rally. Therefore, the safest thing to do would be to buy Yahoo stock after the spinoff, if there are further signs that a turnaround is finally occurring by the time of the spinoff. If you're willing to potentially see your account take a big hit you should buy the stock now, as it hovers over 20% below its 2015 high.
