Facebook: F8 Conference Preview - All Eyes On Messenger - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha FB will host its F8 developer conference Wednesday and Thursday. Investors can expect updates on video, news publishing, ad partners, messenger, VR and app monetization. Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) will hold its F8 conference in San Francisco from March 25 to March 26. Although not much has been detailed in the pre-released schedule , we can get some idea on what will be discussed in the conference. Worth noting is that last year, FB did not pre-release any schedule. The fact that it is releasing it ahead of the conference gives me a sense that this year's conference will be particularly impactful with unique insights on Facebook's future strategy involving video, news publishing, advertising partners, messenger, virtual reality, and app monetization. 1.

Of the sessions listed above, I am particularly interested in the one regarding FB Messenger. As I highlighted in my prior note " Facebook: What's Next For Messenger? " I believe that FB Messenger, rather than WhatsApp, will be FB's key mobile communication platform and that FB will, over time, encourage WhatsApp users to gradually migrate to FB Messenger to have a single communication platform where FB can incorporate various services such as payment, search, O2O, e-commerce and banking. Frankly speaking, WhatsApp is becoming more like BlackBerry Messenger given its limited functions so it would be capital intensive for FB to simultaneously develop both messaging platforms. The introduction of P2P payment on FB Messenger rather than WhatsApp is a clear indication that FB is focusing more on FBM rather than WhatsApp as the future of its mobile communication platform. The FBM session will be run by Seth Rosenberg (Product Manager), Lexy Franklin (Product Manager) and Matt Steiner (Engineering Director). While no details of their expertise were given in the pre-release, we dug into LinkedIn (NYSE: LNKD ) to see that Rosenberg was a former banker at Goldman Sachs and an entrepreneur. Franklin had prior experience in O2O and location-based-services with Booyah, which developed games that "allows users to buy real-world business locations." His most recent role prior to FB involved a company that specializes in behavioral change. Finally, Steiner was a former Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) employee who specialized in storage, indexing, mail systems, web crawling, photo/video storage, processing and serving systems. Additionally, he was a tech lead at Google + and inventor of auto-backup, auto-organize, auto-highlight, auto-enhance and auto-awesome for Google Photos. In short, the three speakers for the Messenger session all have unique backgrounds and this gives us some clue as to what the session will be about. The most probable scenario will be the incorporation of O2O and LBS into the app in which a notification or an alert could theoretically alternate the existing behavior of the individual and encourage that individual to either log into FB or conduct a transaction. Alternatively, photos will be a key feature within the messenger platform where users can easily store, organize, backup and share photos with their close friends similarly to WeChat moment, a timeline of tweets that a user can publish on WeChat. In addition, search (web crawling) could also be one of the features for users with the crawler initially searching within FB's massive universe to fulfill the query before resorting to Google. I remain bullish on FB. Messenger will be a key driver of future engagement for FB as user time spend shifts from PC to mobile and makes mobile apps a more concentrated service (ie, mobile messenger). A broader enhancement of the FBM will be a key catalyst for the stock.
