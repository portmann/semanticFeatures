Check your browser settings or contact your network administrator. Apple is spreading around where consumers can buy its Apple Watch, adding Target as the second retailer aside from the brand’s mothership to offer the gadget. Best Buy was the first retailer Apple allowed to sell its newest gadgets, which went on sale in June. Target says the Apple Watch will be in some stores this week, and all locations by Oct. 25. For those who prefer shopping online, it’ll be on sale at Target.com starting Oct. 18. Just like the deal with Best Buy, shoppers will be limited to a certain assortment of watch styles — so no 18-karat rose gold wrist pieces for $17,000. You’ll have to go straight to Apple for that. There will be 20 models to choose from in both the 38mm and 42mm sizes, including space gray and rose gold colors. Select models and bands will be available at all Target stores, with more Apple Watch Sport and Apple Watch styles available online, ranging from $349 to $599 in price. The deal with Target has a wider reach for Apple than the Best Buy partnership — Target has about 1,800 stores nationwide, while Best Buy clocks in at around 1,047 stores.
