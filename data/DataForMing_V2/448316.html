Will Facebook Stop Trump? - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Brexit and the rise of Donald Trump are driven by the same economic phenomenon: globalization has left the working classes of developed countries behind. Since Brexit, elites have discussed ways of countering working class voters' opposition to globalization. We discuss how Facebook can help them do so. We also discuss implications for investors in Facebook and other companies of a Clinton or Trump victory in November. The Washington Post's Wonkblog featured a striking chart this week, screen captured below ("The World's Losers Are Revolting, And Brexit Is Only The Beginning"). That economic losers are likely to vote for change isn't the revelation here: others, including Chris Arnade ("Why Trump voters aren't complete idiots") have made this point before. What's striking about the Wonkblog chart is how it shows this phenomenon globally. Matt O'Brien elaborated and added historical context on WonkBlog: [G]lobal capitalism didn't always work so well for workers in the United States and Europe even as - or, in some cases, because - it pulled hundreds of millions of people out of poverty everywhere else. In fact, the working class in rich countries have seen their real, or inflation-adjusted, incomes flatline or even fall since the Berlin Wall came down and they were forced to compete with all the Chinese, Indian and Indonesian workers entering the global economy. You can see that in the chart [above], put together from economist Branko Milanovic's data. This was a political powder keg. If rich-world workers were losing ground even when times were good, what would happen if we got hit by one of the financial crises the new global economy seemed to spawn every few years? Well, things would get ugly. [...] It didn't take long, then, for the West's triumphal globalism to fuel a nationalist backlash. In the United States it's Trump, in France it's the National Front, in Germany it's the Alternative for Germany and, yes, in Britain it's the Brexiters. Broadly speaking, there are two political possibilities in the U.S. and Western Europe: more economic nationalism, or less democracy. For readers who are tempted to dismiss the second possibility out of hand, consider the widening split between elites versus the Americans who voted for Trump and the Britons who voted for Brexit. Chris Arnade, in his post about Trump voters not being complete idiots, included an example of elite disdain by Jonathan Chiat of New York Magazine, but there has been a flurry of these sorts of sentiments since the Brexit vote. James Traub's recent essay in Foreign Policy is illustrative ("It's Time for the Elites to Rise Up Against The Ignorant Masses"). Read it if you like, but the title gives you the gist: those voting against globalization are wrong, and it's up to elites to counter them. How might elites counter the masses? Perhaps in part by using the power of Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ). Consider that a study in Nature showed the ability of Facebook to increase voter turnout. According to that study, a single Facebook message sent out by researchers led to an extra 340,000 users voting in the 2010 November elections in the U.S. Consider also that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told Germany's Chancellor Merkel that he was working on policing sentiment against her immigration policy expressed on Facebook in Germany. Perhaps Prime Minister David Cameron of Great Britain should have had a similar conversation with Mr. Zuckerberg, given the role of immigration in the Brexit debate. Consider further the allegations that Facebook has applied political bias to users newsfeeds, and you can see how elites might be able to use it to steer election outcomes. It helps, of course, that Facebook's CEO is on their side. Mark Zuckerberg's lobbying group, FWD. us, has been open about its support for globalist policies such as expanded immigration, and it's been open about its opposition to Donald Trump (as the screen capture below, in which FWD.us concern trolls the GOP, illustrates). Investing Implications Of Facebook's Side Winning If Facebook succeeds in helping elites keep a lid on the populist powder keg, expect more of current economic policies: more emphasis on expanding trade and immigration, and more emphasis on global integration. To get a sense of the sorts of companies, in addition to Facebook, that might benefit from an extension of the status quo, consider the ones whose employees and political action committees have donated the most to the candidate in the U.S. who is more closely aligned with current economic policies, Hillary Clinton. According to Open Secrets , her top contributors include those from Citigroup (NYSE: C ), JP Morgan (NYSE: JPM ), Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ), Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS ), Time Warner (NYSE: TWX ), Corning (NYSE: GLW ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), and Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ). If Donald Trump wins, and pursues the policies he's campaigned on, perhaps some of the companies that donated to his opponent won't do as well as they might have otherwise, but for diversified investors, my message remains, Don't Fear Donald Trump . In that article, I elaborated on why investors shouldn't worry about the prospect of more economic nationalism. The short version is that America has enacted similar policies in the past and the economy and stock market, in the main, prospered. Facebook should manage as well. As I noted there, Does that mean Facebook [...] wouldn't be able to navigate under a President Trump? No. If Candidate Trump becomes President Trump, these companies will work within his policies the same way they work within the policies of foreign leaders all over the world. Mark Zuckerberg and Tim Cook may not be fans of Donald Trump, but that won't stop them from doing business in President Trump's America any more than their differences with, say, Prime Minister Najib Razak keep them from doing business in Prime Minister Razak's Malaysia now. Since I run a website and an iOS app that help investors hedge, it's in my interest to point out risks. And I've written about Trump's threats against specific companies before [such as Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN )]. But the more I think about the prospect of a President Trump, the more I think the risk to investors is overstated. Maybe you should panic about something else. Consider who does want you to panic about a turn toward economic nationalism: those who oppose it. Hence, the ominous warnings about the impact of the "Leave" side winning the Brexit vote. And yet, as of Thursday's close, the London stock exchange, as measured by the FTSE 100, was already up over 2.6% since before the vote. That said, if you still concerned about the risk of an economic nationalist winning in November, you can review how to limit your market risk .
