Still no word from Yahoo's board - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha Dec  6 2015, 08:17 ET | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) shareholders still do not know how - or if - the company's board plans to restructure the technology giant. The firm's directors ended three days of deliberations on Friday without announcing whether they will proceed with plans to spin off its stake in Alibaba, sell its core business, shake up management, or do something else entirely. "A boatload of sources," however, told Re/code's Kara Swisher that Yahoo's board will make a decision by the end of the weekend. They are why the reason why companies are poorly managed. Incompetent high paid board directors and stubborn CEO who only know how to negotiate the world best severance package becos she knew she cannot do the job. What is the hurry for a deal? Is there anything different a week or a month from now that a deal has to be made now? A month from now, after the tax selling season I see BABA shares up at least 10% and all other YHOO assets worth about the same. My vote would be for waiting at least a month and MM twins are born. The BOD and Starboard are behind MM.
