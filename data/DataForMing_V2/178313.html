ETF Hub Sep 21 2015, 12:43 ET | By: Clark Schultz , SA News Editor Netflix ( NFLX -1.4%) won four Emmy awards last night to fall short of the seven it landed last year and the 14 won by streaming rival HBO. The only major award won by Netflix was by Uzo Aruba for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for her performance in Orange is the New Black. Newer shows such as Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and Marco Polo didn't receive the critical acclaim the company was hoping to land. Thank you Christian Alpers. That the Emmy Awards are a factor in the analysis of the stock and its award shortfall is just nonsense. If it comes to this, then we ought to know what Kim Kardashian, Kanye West and baby North West watch before we invest or not in NFLX.
