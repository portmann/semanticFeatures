ETF Hub Apr 14 2015, 16:42 ET | About: Intel Corporation (INTC) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) had a Q1 gross margin of 60.5%, -540 bps Q/Q and +90 bps Y/Y, and slightly above a guidance midpoint of 60%. Q2 GM guidance is at 62% (+/- 2%); full-year GM guidance has been cut by 1% to 61% (+/- 2%). In its CFO commentary (.pdf), Intel notes higher ASPs provided a 50 bps Q/Q GM boost in Q1, and are expected to provide a 150 bps Q2 boost; a mix shift towards server CPUs appears to be helping. Lower factory startup costs are expected to provide a 100 bps Q/Q Q2 boost, while lower platform volumes and higher platform unit costs will respectively provide 150 bps and 100 bps headwinds. Client Computing Group (CCG - PC/mobile processors) ASPs rose 1% Q/Q and fell 13% Y/Y in Q1 (mix shift towards Atom); unit volumes fell 18% Q/Q (seasonality and PC weakness) and rose 6% Y/Y. Data Center Group (DCG - server/networking CPUs) ASPs fell 3% Q/Q and rose 5% Y/Y; unit volumes fell 7% Q/Q and rose 15% Y/Y (the Grantley Xeon launch and Web/cloud demand). Segment Performance: CCG revenue -8% Y/Y to $7.42B; op. profit -24% to $1.41B. DCG revenue +19% to $3.68B; op. profit +27% to $1.7B. IoT Group revenue +11% to $533M; op. profit -24% to $87M. Software/services revenue -3% to $534M; op. profit falls to $3M from $19M. All other (flash memory, one-time expenses) revenue +13% to $615M; op. loss falls to $586M from $749M. $750M was spent on buybacks, down from Q4's $4B (saving cash for an Altera deal?).  GAAP R&D/MG&A spend rose just 1% Y/Y to $4.95B. Intel ended Q1 with $14.1B in cash/investments ($10.7B offshore), and $13.2B in debt. Good but not great news.  We need to hear about Atom x3-x7 design wins, PC sales turnaround Q2-3 based on Windows 10 inventory ramp and continuing DCG server demand and growth.  I'm glad they cut CAPEX $1.3 billion and did not pull the trigger on Altera.  Let's see what color the Earnings Call contains?
