Revisiting My Yahoo Investment: A Declining Search Business - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha Yahoo is projecting 2016 revenues of $4.4-4.6 billion, the lowest revenues Marissa Mayer has delivered. The company continues to lose search market share on desktop and mobile, while Bing is steadily growing. I started analyzing Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) in late 2013, prior to writing about the company in August and November of the following year. At that time, YHOO was trading around $40 per share. My research, and that of numerous other analysts, found a company that was trading well below its sum-of-the-parts value. With a market capitalization of $36-38 billion, $40+ billion attributed to Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ), and a negatively valued core business, this seemed like a no-brainer investment. Two years after my initial investment, my Yahoo shares have returned a paltry 3%, compared to a 9% S&P 500 return during the same period. This was a stock that was supposed to generate a 30+% return, if we look back at the price targets set by several banks . It did so briefly, when Alibaba began approaching a $300 billion market capitalization post IPO, as Yahoo stock closely imitates Alibaba's performance. However, as Alibaba shares have settled around a $200 billion value as of late, we have also seen a settling of Yahoo shares. At the time of writing, Yahoo's market capitalization is $35.8 billion, essentially unchanged from the time of my investment - the slight difference attributed to Alibaba's performance and the company's buyback program. Here are the details of trends I overlooked in my analysis, and my opinion regarding the core business spin-off. (Source: Yahoo Inc. Q1 2016 Financial Highlights ) Revenue has remained stagnant at Yahoo over the last five years, staying within the $4.6-4.98 billion range. While acceptable for a company in the midst of a turnaround, come July CEO Marissa Mayer will be entering her fifth year at the role, and she has announced that 2016 will see a decrease in revenue. Yahoo is projecting $4.4-4.6 billion in revenue in 2016, as compared to $4.968 billion in 2015. As of Q1 of this year, Search accounts for 45% of the company's revenue - a 1% YOY increase in source revenue contribution, but a $50 million decrease in Search revenue at $492 million, compared to $542 million in the prior year. While Search revenue increased in 2015 compared to 2014, it was due to higher price-per-click, as Yahoo has seen its search query market share decrease during the same period. (Source: Yahoo Inc. Q4 2015 Financial Highlights ) The company has recognized this and is aggressively building its Mavens (also stylized as "MaVeNS": Mobile, Video, Native, and Social) business. Mavens is projected to contribute just under $2 billion in revenue in 2016, but will account for over two-thirds of GAAP revenue by 2020 as a $4 billion segment. As depicted in the above graphs, Yahoo has seen a steady decrease in search market share for over 4 years. Its global Search market share on desktop was 7.2% as of April, boosted in November 2014 by its default search agreement with Mozilla. Globally on mobile, Google ( GOOGL , GOOG ) is unmatched with its 95% market share. In the US - its largest revenue contributing market at 80% - Yahoo's search market share is gradually decreasing. Currently, the platform is positioned at roughly 12% market share, also boosted in November 2014 by its default search deal within Firefox. In addition, Bing's recent growth, both domestically and in the global markets, have eaten into Yahoo's market share. Bing is a $1.5 billion business for Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), three times larger than Yahoo's search business, which in turn, also powers over 50% of Yahoo's searches. Keep in mind, Microsoft offered to buy Yahoo for $45 billion at one point. In search, market share is king. With it, advertisers flock to your platform and you can be more aggressive in the rates you charge per ad. While Yahoo is still a relevant platform in search and is generating higher price-per-click, it is quickly losing market share to Bing and Google. The company will have to continue to invest in Mavens if it wants to become a more relevant advertising platform. Like many Yahoo investors, I read what seems like every article related to the impending Yahoo spin-off. It's an area of solace for many frustrated investors who are patiently waiting to realize any form of financial gain relating to Yahoo or Alibaba. Yahoo's core business is still an attractive asset. During the company's Q4 2015 earnings call, CEO Marissa Mayer confirmed Yahoo's collective platform still draws one billion monthly active users. Mayer also mentioned the company's monthly active users on mobile doubled in 2015. While its search market share is decreasing, the platform is still capable of drawing users and advertisers. The company's advertising platform is a meaningful business and is enticing to potential acquirers. Motif Investing reported on Seeking Alpha that as many as 40 companies had expressed interest in Yahoo initially, including SoftBank Group ( OTCPK:SFTBY ), Britain's Daily Mail ( OTCPK:DMTGY , OTC:DMTGF ), and Time Inc. (NYSE: TIME ). The current frontrunner seems to be Verizon (NYSE: VZ ). I won't comment on the synergies on a Verizon acquisition, as many other analysts have already provided color on the potential deal. With the addition of Starboard Value LP's chief executive, Jeffrey Smith, and three of his nominated directors to Yahoo's board, shareholders are fairly confident a spin-off will materialize in the coming months. After four years at the helm, Marissa Mayer's Yahoo is still struggling to grow in a crowded search and advertising market. Bing is quickly grabbing market share in the US, and Yahoo's mobile aspirations will struggle to compete with Google. In advertising, the competition is even greater with Bing and Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) in the mix. Yahoo's core business can be viable with the right acquirer. If acquired, the company will have access to the capital needed to rapidly grow its Mavens business, potentially reaching the $4 billion segment target before 2020. But that is not the reason I am holding this stock. Though I will likely hold to on to my shares going forward, it is due to my desire to hold on to Alibaba, not the potential $6 billion ad business that is Yahoo.
