Verizon's Future Is Foggy, Own AT&T Instead - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha Since the Verizon Wireless acquisition, operational cash flow is down and leverage is up. Equity investors were diluted in the deal, and the dividend is not as easily covered by cash flow as it once was. Further cementing problems, capital expenditures are up as the company focuses on a deteriorating U.S. wireless market. As an incredibly solid and long-standing dividend payer, Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) has found itself as an anchor in many retail investor's dividend portfolios. The telecommunications business environment, while at times volatile and extremely capital intensive, could be counted on to generate substantial free cash flow to its largest, most profitable participants. This profitability allowed Verizon to always easily cover its dividend obligations with cash to spare. However, Verizon's recent business decisions to focus its efforts on U.S. wireless assets should at least bring pause to how investors view the long-term health and growth potential of the existing dividend. For those who have been living under a rock, Verizon bought out Vodafone's (NASDAQ: VOD ) 45% interest in Verizon Wireless back in early 2014 during one of the largest corporate deals in history, finally giving itself full ownership of the entity. This $130B payout was expensive, and was paid for in part by equity dilution of current shareholders and substantial debt issuance. More than 1.27B shares were issued, heavily increasing the company's annual dividend obligations. Despite acquiring full interest in Verizon Wireless, operational cash flow has fallen; down 22% in 2014 from the $38.8B high in 2013. 2015 cash flow generation, while improving from 2014, still will not recover pre-deal highs. Despite a weakening earnings profile of wireless assets due to incredibly intense competition in an already saturated U.S. wireless market, the company has moved more of its betting chips towards this business line. As of the most recent quarter, more than two thirds of revenue is generated from Verizon's wireless business here in America, compared to a nearly 50/50 revenue mix with wireline assets back in 2011. International expansion has been avoided by management. As part of this shift from wireline to wireless, in February of this year Verizon announced it was selling certain landline assets, including its highly profitable FiOS internet, to Frontier for $10.5B. These consumer wireline assets had been steadily growing and profitable. In fact, revenue growth in mass market wireline had been the only source of growth for Verizon's wireline division in recent years, with continued weak results in enterprise and wholesale dragging down the segment. In my opinion, divestitures should cut mediocre or underperforming assets, not the key business line. The announcement of this deal came shortly after Verizon bid $10.4B in a FCC wireless spectrum auction to acquire an additional 65Mhz of assets. Like SA contributor Brian Nichols, I don't believe this to be just happenstance . With the corporate coffers drained, Verizon would have had to go to the markets again to raise capital to fund their obligation for the sale. Undoubtedly they would have raised the money no problem, but further borrowing to increase leverage so shortly after the prior year's mega deal would have raised eyebrows at ratings agencies and investment banks. This also raises the question of future spectrum purchases. The spectrum market is an interesting one for wireless companies. This finite resource will only get more expensive to acquire as consumers demand more and more data for wireless service providers; us Millennials have nothing better to do than stream Youtube all day. While the government has been increasingly willing to allocate under-utilized portions of the spectrum away from other data users, in the end I think it is inevitable these purchases will get both more expensive and more frequent with time in order to sate data-hungry consumer needs. Currently, both Verizon and AT&T (NYSE: T ) classify these purchases as acquisitions, not capital expenditures, as per GAAP accounting rules. I find this slightly misleading in that continued purchases of spectrum is much akin to upgrades to say, a mining operation, to allow further production volume. Nonetheless, as a result these costs are not currently included in calculations of free cash flow as presented by management. Personally, I believe investors will need to start considering the cash flow impact of these purchases more carefully going into the future. Verizon's capital expenditures have grown leaps and bounds in 2015 as the company spends money to build out its wireless infrastructure (this number does not include the $10.4B spent in the FCC spectrum auction). With flat 2016 earnings per share guidance from Verizon management, bringing its spending down will require capital expenditure cuts, which may not occur. Verizon isn't going to grow its way out of this problem in 2016. I expect capital expenditures within the wireless markets will continue to rise, and Verizon will continue to have to divert significant cash flow to upgrading and expanding its wireless offerings at home if it wants to retain its number one position in the market. Defending its current market share will be difficult. The market continues to reward T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS ) and Sprint (NYSE: S ) for revenue growth against larger incumbent players like Verizon, giving them favorable rates to fund expansion in the debt and equity markets. Even aforementioned Time Warner Cable and Comcast are getting into the game, building out free wifi hotspots in core markets that only their subscribers can access, denting data demand from wireless consumers. All things considered, operating and profit margin erosion seems inevitable. Verizon's largest competitor seems to realize this. Unlike Verizon, AT&T has moved in the opposite direction, diversifying away from its U.S. wireless business. The DirecTV acquisition is the most obvious example of this, another example being its continued purchases of distressed international players: GSF Telecom, Lusacell, and Nextel Mexico to name a recent few. The latter two entities will be combined to form the basis of a company that can compete with long-entrenched Mexican telecommunications powerhouses. As a clear number three behind America Movil and Telefonica that have a combined 90% share, AT&T has significant room to grow and capture market share in Mexico, a country that is experiencing significant growth in its wireless businesses. While there is risk from international expansion, growth should come easier overseas than here at home. Verizon seems hell-bent on continued investment in its U.S. wireless business. The market has matured and further subscription gains will be hard-fought and costly to obtain as smaller rivals remain intent on taking market share. I think AT&T has the better long-term plan here, diversifying into different domestic markets and growing its international businesses within our Latin American neighbors to the south. While Verizon's dividend is not in jeopardy anytime soon, dividend investors need to look long-term. With the two big players trading at quite similar valuation multiples (both slightly less than 12x 2016 earnings), the decision on whether to buy AT&T or Verizon comes squarely down to which business model will bear the most fruit five, ten, or twenty years from now. For me, AT&T looks to be the more logical choice. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information. We do not sell the personal contact data you submit to anyone else.
