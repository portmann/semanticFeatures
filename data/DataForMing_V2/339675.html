Reuters: Starboard wants control of Yahoo's board - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha Mar  4 2016, 18:51 ET | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor Reuters reports activist Starboard Value "will push for control of [Yahoo's] board in talks scheduled for next week." The talks are aimed at avoiding a proxy battle prior to a March 26 deadline to submit board nominees. The NY Post reported last weekend Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ), whose board currently has seven members , is thinking of offering two board seats to Starboard. The firm is the most prominent of several major shareholders to criticize Marissa Mayer and call for major changes. Starboard's efforts come as Yahoo pushes ahead with a turnaround plan featuring job cuts, asset sales, and a narrowing of its Web service offerings, as well as a strategic review that (according to many reports) involves sale talks for the company's core business. they can fire that ridiculous little yuppie princess melissa myers or whatever the name is who thinks she's marie antoinette to start with. THEN clean up the mess. it will take many years. the greasier the dirty laundry the longer the rinse cycle. I will vote with Starboard to remove the Board and management of YHOO. Three and half years of inaction, bloated staff, overpaid management and Board, terrible acquisitions, lack of growth and performance is enough for me. How can anyone do worst? This is all fine and dandy but the best thing that Yhoo has going for it is that Baba has bottomed and is moving up.
