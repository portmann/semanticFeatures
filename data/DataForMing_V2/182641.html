New iPhone 6s hits stores Friday - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Sep 25 2015, 03:18 ET | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor The iPhone 6s and 6s Plus go on sale in many countries today, including the U.S., U.K., China, Australia, Canada and Germany. Shoppers who purchase the devices in an Apple store can opt in to the new iPhone Upgrade Program, which includes Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) warranty plan and the option to upgrade to a new handset every year. Analysts expect 12M-13M phones to fly off the shelves over the weekend, up from more than 10M last year - when the iPhone 6's launch was delayed in China. The China delay from last year is what lets Apple say they are exceeding last year's launch. I think stock looks ready to close the gap and test the old highs. Good first weekend sales should be the catalyst. Rose gold iPhone, excellent camera and China launch should do the trick. Needs to break 50-day EMA. It might rise some, sure, but those highs are exactly what's referred to.  Comment there, not here, if you want to discuss further, and we'll see if I was right or not. It better as Apple has lost US market share against Android every month this year so far according to Kantar data. In fact, it seems that Samsung has actually outsold Apple in the US in recent months, so maybe the S6 and S6 Edge have been more successful than initially thought. The new Plus has nice features that actually affect usability more than just being bigger/faster/better camera or gimmicks that few people will ever use more than once or twice for novelty's sake. Launch purchases don't matter so much as how well the purchasing momentum maintains itself. The January and April earnings next year will likely move the market more than a hung between now and January. $AAPL new data hinting that opening weekend sales for the 6s and 6s+ may be 20% higher than the iphone 6.
