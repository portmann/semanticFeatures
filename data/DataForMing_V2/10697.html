What Ends First - Intel's Stock Buybacks Or Mobile Strategy? - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha In 2014 Intel returned $15 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks ($11B) and dividends ($4B). Total cash burn was $3.1B. The mobile division incurred a $1.1B loss in Q4 as it has been buying market share to expand into mobile devices. Cash and trading assets declined from $18B in 2012 to $14B in 2014. Companies usually embark on an expansion strategy or a share buyback program, but Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) is attempting to do both. The company's attempt to gain market share in mobile devices has been a strain. In July Intel outlined plans to add another $20 billion to its existing share buyback program. However, going forward, the company's mobile strategy or buyback program may have to go. Intel missed the mobile device trend. To catch up, it has been subsidizing the cost incurred by tablet makers for shifting away from chips licensed from ARM Holdings PLC (NASDAQ: ARMH ). In effect, it has been buying market share. In Q3 2014 the company was the second largest supplier of tablet system-on-chips with 19% market share . Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) was first with 30% share and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) was third with 14%. However, its mobile division had negative revenue of $6 million and an operating loss of $1.1 billion. The company's XMM 7360 4G baseband modem is rumored to be included in 2016 iPhone units in certain markets, possibly supplanting Qualcomm. Building a relationship with Apple could potentially be a coup for the company. However, the crowd believes that even if the rumors are true, the deal would merely be addition by subtraction: Assuming that Intel were to win Apple's business for its Cat10 LTE modem for the emerging markets in 2016 (Asia and Latin America), it would be immaterial to its profit margin since (according to rumors) Intel is willing to sell the LTE modem to Apple at cost. However, this will hurt Qualcomm's earnings, so indirectly it would benefit Intel (addition by subtraction). Share Buybacks Are Reducing Cash Balances ... While Intel has been fighting a war on the mobile front, it has been giving money back to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. In 2012 the company generated positive cash flow of $3.4 billion. Total cash out flows were $2.8 billion and $3.1 billion in 2013 and 2014, respectively. Dividends have consistently been about $4.4 billion during the review period. However, stock buybacks were $4.8 billion, $2.1 billion and $10.8 billion in 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. Intel returned over $15 billion in 2014 in the form of buybacks and dividends. That level may not be sustainable long-term. Meanwhile, the company's liquidity has declined from $18 billion in 2012 to $14 billion in 2014. Intel's bread and butter remains its PC client group which represents about 60% of its revenue base. However, growth in PCs has been stagnant. 2014 PC client group revenue grew about 4% Y/Y and according to the Gartner Group , PC vendor unit shipments in Q4 2014 grew about 1% to 84 million, versus 83 million in the year-earlier period: In mid-March Intel lowered its first quarter revenue projection from $13.7 billion to $12.8 billion due to [i] weaker demand for business desktop PCs and [ii] lower than expected inventory levels across the PC supply chain. The estimate assumes zero growth in comparison to revenue of $12.8 billion and $12.6 billion in Q1 2014 and Q1 2013, respectively. Cash burn from expansion into the mobile market, in addition to share buybacks and dividends, has caused Intel's cash and short-term securities to decline from $18 billion in 2012 to $14 billion 2014. This is less than Qualcomm's $18 billion, which it wants to compete with. Furthermore, revenue from its PC client group is expected to remain stagnant. If its mobile division continues to burn cash Intel may have to shutter its mobile strategy or buyback program. I currently have a hold rating on the stock.
