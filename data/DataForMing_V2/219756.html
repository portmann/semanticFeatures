Verizon Communications Raises Dividend 2.7%. Now What? - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha Casey Hoerth , Casey's Finance Journal (Blog) (521 clicks) Management raised dividend by 2.7% last week. Income investors who parked their money in Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) just got a 2.7% pay raise last week when management announced its quarterly dividend. I've been recommending Verizon for awhile now. The company's nation-beating 4G network has powered steady revenue growth as Americans have consumed more and more data. In my latest "mini portfolio" article I listed Verizon as one of my dividend picks. This article takes a closer look at the company's fundamentals, with a focus on its most recent performance, its future growth prospects, financials and valuation. So, understanding Verizon first means understanding that it is made up of two complimentary businesses: Wireless and wireline. The wireline business is stagnant at best, and wireless is growing thanks to significant growth in mobile data consumption. Overall, revenue in the third quarter was up 2.8% excluding divestitures. That includes revenue growth in wireless of 5.3%, and a revenue decline of 2.2% from wireline. Let's start with the latter first. The company's wholesale and enterprise landline businesses were down in revenue by 5.1% and 4.9% respectively. This was partially offset by 7.1% year-on-year growth in FiOS, Verizon's cable and broadband service. FiOS continues to pick up subscribers, but that is not enough to stem the decline in wireline. In the Wireless business, things are better. Wireless revenue was up 5.3%, and that was led by continued 4G, post-paid smartphone adds and increased data use. Wireless retail connections increased 5.5% year-on-year, and smartphone penetration went from 75% to 81% over the past twelve months. Verizon's wireless revenue growth is powered by the fact that Americans' appetite for mobile data has thus far been insatiable. Telecoms have particularly found that consumers used more data when networks were upgraded from 3G to faster 4G technology. Increasing smartphone penetration also had a hand in demand growth for data. But with 81% penetration, smartphones are reaching market saturation. In my opinion, further revenue growth from Verizon will depend on whether Americans will respond to implementation of "5G" technology by consuming even more data. I'm not sure if that's going to happen, but next year Verizon will begin testing 5G technology in select markets. Investors should watch for management's opinion on the results of the testing. Another major part of Verizon's strategy is its acquisition of AOL Inc. Like most big carriers, Verizon is working to remain relevant in an era where the line between entertainment and communication is getting blurry. Verizon's rationale for the AOL purchase was to get excellent platform technology and to acquire Millennial-relevant internet content such as The Huffington Post and Vice media. Personally, as a millennial, I believe that Verizon is sort of missing the point in looking for a "mass market" for this generation. I don't think there is one. Millennials are a much more fractured, tribalized generation than their predecessors are, and those are not my words, but the words of marketing guru Seth Godin. While Huffington Post and Vice are both relevant to millennials, those two outlets only appeal to a narrow swath of this generation. Hopefully Verizon will get its money's worth from these media acquisitions, and will take advantage of some of the better technology being developed by AOL Inc. I believe that if US consumers do indeed have a greater appetite for data consumption, then Verizon will work to build out a 5G network, and will work diligently to maintain its advantage over competitors. That would mean lots of revenue growth, but also lots of capital expenditure. If, however, Verizon sees a lukewarm response to its 5G tests, we may see less growth but also less capex, which wouldn't be so bad either. Shares have bounced a bit since October As things are right now, Verizon's dividend is about as secure as it gets. For the first half of this year, Verizon generated $18.9 billion in operating cash flow, and allocated $8.5 billion to capital expenditure, leaving $10.4 billion in free cash flow. Dividends were $4.2 billion in the first half of the year, leaving a dividend-to-FCF ratio of 40%. For a telecom, it doesn't get much safer than this. That's exactly why I see dividends continuing to grow, in a measured way and above inflation, for the foreseeable future, and that is the core reason why I like Verizon. Verizon is also a value stock. For example, Verizon has averaged a price-to-earnings ratio of around sixteen times. Currently, however, Verizon trades at about twelve times adjusted trailing earnings, so I believe that Verizon still has considerable upside here versus its competition. For example, AT&T sits at thirteen times trailing adjusted earnings, and Verizon's network is a bit stronger than AT&T's. Verizon's dividend-to-FCF ratio is much lower than AT&T's is. If you're looking for a telecom, I believe Verizon is still the best choice. Yes, the price of shares has bounced a bit over the last couple weeks, but Verizon is still a buy nevertheless.
