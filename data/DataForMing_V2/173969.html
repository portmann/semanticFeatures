Check your browser settings or contact your network administrator. Though Apple is still expected to release iOS 9 for its iPhones and iPads later today, if you’ve got an Apple Watch, you’ll have to wait a bit longer for a software upgrade that was slated for this morning: the company says it’s delaying watchOS 2 due to a bug. Apple hasn’t explained what the exact issue is or when Watch users can expect the updated software to be released, saying only in a statement (via TechCrunch ): “We have discovered a bug in development of watchOS 2 that is taking a bit longer to fix than we expected. We will not release watchOS 2 today but will shortly.” The software upgrade is supposed to make the Watch perform faster and provide a new slate of face options for users. Previously, you couldn’t use your own photos as a watch face, something the software upgrade will now allow. Apple also claims there will be more native apps — read: apps that come with the Watch that can’t be removed — that don’t require users to use their phones.
