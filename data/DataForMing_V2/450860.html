Long Term, Disney Is A Strong Buy - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Disney just announced it will take a stake in MLB Advanced Media in an attempt to re-initiate growth on its cable networks. Disney's 10-year fundamentals are excellent. Furthermore its earnings multiple should rise from here. Disney has ample runway for growth in countries such as China where it has just opened up its first park in Shanghai. Disney (NYSE: DIS ) has been having a hard time of it lately. Revenue for its media networks has been decreasing as of late (which still makes up the predominant top line in the company) and consequently, investors have been punishing the stock. In one way this stock reminds me a bit of Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ) in that both companies have cash cows (cable networks for Disney and routers and switches for CSCO) but both divisions are slowing down meaningfully. Furthermore both companies have smaller divisions which are growing much faster but still have a bit to go before being able to catch the cash cow divisions. Moreover both companies have excellent balance sheets and spin off excellent free cash flow every quarter which means buybacks and dividend increases should continue. Yesterday it was announced that Disney would acquire a stake in MLB Advanced Media in an effort to restart growth for its cable networks. Obviously the company hopes the added value will make more eyeballs "stick" but this remains to be seen. And this is where we are with Disney stock at the moment. Its films and parks are performing exceptionally well but ESPN is underperforming which is a concern considering the operating income it produces for the company (33%). However long-term investors need only watch the following metrics which should indicate the direction of the stock going forward. Going back 10 years gives an idea of how results may turn out in the future. As we can see, Disney's 10-year core fundamentals are very strong. We just need to see stability on the ESPN side of the business for investors to get interested again. The top line is still expected to grow by 7.4% to $56.35 billion this year which looks really positive. Furthermore the company's earnings multiple of 18.05 is slightly below the company's five-year average although its sales multiple of 3.0 and its price to book ratio of 3.6 are both above the industry average the company's five-year averages. So are we left with a company that is fairly valued? Doesn't its valuation metrics tell us so? Well yes if the fundamentals were more or less the same over the past 5 to 10 years but the studio acquisitions this company has made over the past years have transformed the company and we can see it in the numbers. As we can see from the chart below, the company's earnings multiple is almost at its 10-year average but the table below it illustrates how the company's changing fundamentals should mean a higher earnings multiple in the quarters and years to come. The ESPN saga and shutting down of the Infinity franchise will end up being short-term headwinds in my view. Yes, the $147 million charge will cut the top line a touch in the near term but Disney has plenty of firepower to keep growing the top line by 6 to 9%, at least going forward. Such growth triggers (which go hand in hand) are its: Studio segment which grew its operating income to $1.55 billion in the first six months of 2016. Star Wars was a huge reason for the surge in profits here and with another installment to be released before the year is out, I can only see this division going from strength to strength. The studio acquisitions Disney made in the past really have brought the company forward to the point where customers now know what they are getting with the brands. Trust is paramount plus many films now (especially the Pixar films) appeal both to adults and children which again increases the pulling power back to its brand All of this good stuff ties in with the company's theme parks where film characters can be leveraged through consumer products, toys, DVDs, attraction rides, etc. I live in Spain and Euro-Disney in France is a huge attraction for families here and the park is about 1,500km north of where I live. Now take Disney's newly opened park in Shanghai. This thing is huge and has something like 330 million people living within 300km of the park. Talk about leverage. China could easily become Disney's biggest market in the not so distant future if everything goes to plan. The one thing that Disney has going for it is that the Chinese are noted avid film watchers. That is where it all starts... Investors will be watching the Chinese market with interest over the next 12 to 24 months. To sum up, Disney stock is in no-man's land at the moment because the market doesn't know how the company's ESPN cash cow is going to fare. Whatever happens, I see growth from the company's other divisions more than compensating over the long term for the slowing growth in its cable networks. We may look to scale into a position in Disney when implied volatility will be high at month's end when the next earnings will be announced. To sum up, I'm going to be adding a few good dividend and growth stocks to the Elevation Portfolio over the next several weeks when I see value. In order to ensure that income is brought in every month, it's imperative that they are not correlated and all don't have similar valuations.
