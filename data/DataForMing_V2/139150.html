ETF Hub Aug  4 2015, 19:40 ET | About: The Boeing Company (BA) | By: Carl Surran , SA News Editor Boeing (NYSE: BA ) is scrambling to find alternate financing for a satellite contract worth "several hundred million dollars" that was scuttled by commercial satellite provider ABS due to uncertainty about the future of the U.S. Export-Import Bank , according to a Reuters report. ABS is said to have terminated its order for the satellite in mid-July, citing the expiration of the trade bank's charter on June 30 and that it would have to consider non-U.S.-based producers, given the absence of U.S. export credit financing. I worked at the rocket factory for many years. We lost numerous satellite contracts , not because of the IM bank. The US government destroyed the US satellite industry 15 to 20 years ago (Exports) because of the onerous ITAR rules. It took 6 to 12 months to get a license just to talk to offshore customers.  Don't just take it from me, many people will provide the same info. The rules lacked any common sense. We can skew the news in many ways. If you want a satellite business in the USA, then go talk to the Feds and ask for rules that make sense. Most international customers do not want to deal with us because our bureaucracy is overwhelming. The bureaucrats  often don't know what technology to protect, so they protect everything including rivets and bolts.
