Why Are Netflix Shareholders Confused? - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Netflix shares dropped almost 16% after Q2 2016 earnings release. The revenue exceeded expectations, however the increase in subscriber base failed to meet expectations. Is Netflix facing severe competition? What are the challenges the company is facing? Netflix ( NASDAQ:NFLX ) saw a whopping 15.8% drop in share price after hours on July 18th, 2016 even after the company announced better than expected Q2 2016 earnings. Although the revenue numbers were better than expected, Netflix had a big miss in the subscriber numbers. Netflix added 1.7 million members in this quarter well below the expected 2.5 million new members. The markets probably overreacted in a short span of time, but could a reduction in the subscriber base be the first warning sign for investors to cash in on their profits from this multi-bagger stock? During the earnings call, CEO Reed Hastings was extremely positive about the company. He spoke about various expansion strategies which Netflix has undertaken also commented that the decrease in the additional subscriber base was a short term phase for the company. With the increased revenue, the company expects to invest this amount in content creation and come out with better content and better returns for the shareholders. There is no doubt that Netflix had been a very innovative company in providing its streaming services along with its original content and remained at the top position for the last 7 - 10 years. However, the company does face increased competition and quite a bit of challenges henceforth. This also makes it quite unpredictable for the next few years and that probably is a cause for concern with the shareholders. Here are the challenges which Netflix foresees: 1. Increase in cost of content creation One of Netflix's major attractions is its original content which keeps consumers glued to it. However, the cost of content creation has been rising steadily in the past. For e.g. the company spent $90 Million (on 10 episodes) on the series "Marco Polo" which premiered on Netflix in December 2014. It also signed similar deals with other shows such as The Blacklist ($2 Million per episode) and The Walking Dead ($1.35 Million per episode). Netflix is expected to pay around $6 Billion for content creation in 2016 which is going to put a significant pressure on the margins. Although original content creation is extremely vital to the company's success, the company needs to decide between profits and additional investment and maintain competitiveness. 2. Strong resistance to increase in subscription cost On one hand, the content creation costs are going up and on the other hand consumers are extremely sensitive to a price increase. In this highly competitive environment, even a slight upward price tick makes them start searching for comparable alternatives. This is exactly what happened in the Q2 2016 results of the company yesterday where the increase in consumer base was far from expectations. The following table shows the revenue growth and cash flow position of the company. As you can see, the current cash flow position of the company is negative. Expansion plans will further add on to this burden. Netflix has remained a strong brand until now retaining almost a monopoly or at least a far superior position compared to its competitors. Things have however now started changing with increased competition from competitors such as Amazon, Sling TV and Hulu Plus. According to Neilsen, in Q4 2014 (the latest data available), here is the breakdown of Netflix, Amazon and Hulu Plus streaming services in American households Netflix has no doubt been a pioneer having hosted very popular shows. However, Amazon which has continuously proven to be a very innovative company cannot be counted out neither can Hulu Plus which is owned by 21st Century Fox ( NASDAQ:FOX ), the Walt Disney Co. ( NYSE:DYS ) and NBC Universal, a subsidiary of Comcast Corp.( NASDAQ:CMCSA ) International expansion is a major challenge for Netflix. With the company announcing its expansion to 190 countries in January 2016, there is a vast amount of work to be done before the international business turns profitable. Netflix business is far more difficult than opening a retail outlet across countries. Having a streaming service would require an in depth understanding of different international markets, understanding of unique cultural tastes and obtaining a proper mix of local language and English language content as well as the optimum price point which can maximize the revenue and subscribers for the company. Also many countries don't have a developed broadband infrastructure which can add to the challenges. Since each country will pose a unique challenge, it is extremely difficult to calculate the profitability margins, cash flow position or the turnaround period for each of these countries. As a result the expansion may result in a erosion of profitable growth and erode shareholder value. The company, no doubt is steadily increasing its revenue year on year. However, the company already has a negative cash flow. The company is going to face multiple headwinds from various directions over the next few quarters. Implementing all the strategies outlined above will require extensive amount of cash, which the company will have to raise from external sources like issuing bonds or taking long term loans. The biggest threat to the company is currently if it can outgrow its programming costs. Netflix, between its content costs and the cost of adding subscribers, is spending more than it is collecting. How long can this continue? CEO Reed Hastings, however comes out very politely and confidently in his address that he is extremely confident about the company's long term strategy and that the company will deliver bigger profits in 2017. Whether he can deliver on that promise will be a test of investor's faith and confidence.
