Yahoo's Alibaba Failure - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha Other than sell its stake, Yahoo has done no business with Alibaba. Yahoo has cloud assets that should have interested the Chinese e-commerce company. In all the hoopla over Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) CEO Jack Ma's latest visit to America and the company's entry into the U.S. market, something important is being ignored. It should be here already. It already had an ally here, an ally it ignored and kicked to the curb. That ally was Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ). Yahoo has been the biggest winner in Alibaba's march to the market. A $1 billion investment for 40% of the company, in 2005 , negotiated by co-founder CEO Jerry Yang, has turned into the smartest thing the company has ever done. CEO Marissa Mayer has bought herself time, and praise from shareholders, through her slow, methodical dispersal of the stake since becoming CEO - most recently through a tax-free spin-off of the remaining shares. Yahoo has assets that Alibaba could have used. The company has enormous cloud resources that could have brought Alibaba into the U.S. market very quickly. It could, and probably still should, be willing to sell itself to Alibaba in order to increase the business. As a result, Yahoo has become dead money. Since the start of the year, it's down 18%. Revenues are down about $350 million from 2011, a year before CEO Mayer's appointment. Operating income has plummeted, from $800 million in 2011 to less than $143 million last year. Yahoo has bought a lot of companies during that time , from Summly to Rockmelt to Tumblr, but it has no growth to show for it. Yahoo was one of the first cloud companies. Doug Cutting created Hadoop, the Big Data computing program, while an employee of Yahoo. Yet, the cloud revolution has continued to pass Yahoo by. It remains what it was before Mayer came on board - a media company, and not a very effective one at that. While a host of new companies have grown through Internet media - Vox, Buzzfeed, and Vice being just three of them - Yahoo has remained stuck in the past. One of its most successful media efforts is a radio network. Yahoo has become the Internet's Miami of Ohio, a cradle of billionaires stuck in the lower leagues. Whose fault is that? At this point, Alibaba has the market cap to buy Yahoo, including its own Alibaba stake, five times over. Why hasn't it even considered that ultimate payoff? Is Marissa Mayer just a younger version of Carly Fiorina? Is it possible that Google ( GOOG , GOOGL ) CEO Larry Page was right to isolate her within the Google hierarchy, kick her to the curb as an ego-tripper, so that she was in position to take the top job at Yahoo?
