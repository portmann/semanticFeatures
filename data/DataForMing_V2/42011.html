Take A Bite Into Apple With These Tech ETFs | Seeking Alpha Apr. 28, 2015  1:46 PM ET  |  Includes: AAPL , IYW , VGT , XLK by: Zacks Funds Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) continued its run of spectacular quarterly performance. After the closing bell on Apr 27, it reported a huge beat on both the top and the bottom lines for second-quarter fiscal 2015. Robust iPhone and Mac sales as well as record performance by the App Store made last quarter the best ever. The technology giant also promised to return more capital to shareholders. Earnings per share came in at $2.33, which comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.19 and improved from the year-ago earnings of $1.66. Apple has now surpassed earnings expectations for seven quarters in a row. Revenues climbed 27% year over year to $58 billion and were well ahead of our estimate of $57.46 billion. Gross margin was 40.8%, up from 39.3% in the year-ago quarter and ahead of the company's own guidance of 38.5-39.5%. Sales of iPhone surged 40% year over year to 61.2 million and easily crushed the Wall Street forecast of 58 million. This represents the second highest iPhone sales in the company's history. China led the way higher in selling iPhones last quarter and outpaced the U.S. for the first time, buoyed by the appeal for the larger-screen smartphones and the New Year gift-giving holiday. With this, China has become the second largest iPhone market after U.S., outpacing Europe. Overall, sales in China soared 71% year over year to $16.8 billion (read: China ETFs: Bull or Bear in the Year of the Goat? ). Meanwhile, sales for Mac desktop computers grew 10.3% year over year to 4.563 million. However, iPad sales continued to disappoint for the fifth consecutive quarter, falling 22.8% to 12.623 million. The ubiquitous gadget-maker foresees revenues in the range of $46-$48 billion for the current quarter; the midpoint is slightly lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $47.087 billion. Further, Apple expects gross margin in the range of 38.5-39.5% for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. The iPhone maker boosted its dividend by 11% year over year to 52 cents per share and raised its share buyback program from $90 billion to $140 billion. This will result in $200 billion in shareholder rewards by the end of March 2017. With this, the company is expected to regain its top dividend payer status, pushing the oil giant Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM ) back to the second spot. Further, earlier this month, Apple launched its Watch, which is currently available in 9 countries, namely Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, the UK and the U.S. Demand for this wearable device is high, and the company is looking to increase its existing supply as well as roll out Watch in additional countries by the end of this quarter. Shares of AAPL were modestly up about 1.2% in after-market hours and are expected to move higher in the coming days. Apple currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), suggesting that the stock's outperformance will continue (read: 3 Stocks Driving the Nasdaq 100 ETF to New Highs ).
