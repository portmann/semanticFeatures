Unions set Wednesday deadline for wireline strike against Verizon - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha Apr 11 2016, 14:29 ET | About: Verizon Communications (VZ) | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Wireline employees for Verizon ( VZ -1%) have a strike deadline set for Wednesday after months of negotiations failed to bear fruit. Two unions (the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers) have set April 13 as a strike deadline as there's been no follow-up to contracts that expired last August. More than 39,000 represented Verizon workers on the East Coast are involved. A work stoppage would affect FiOS TV as well as telephone and broadband. The unions say Verizon has been cutting vital staff for years and plans to do more offshoring and cut job security. The company says it's ready to serve customers in any event and that it's committed to its negotiation objectives. "Verizon has been moving the bargaining process forward, but now union leaders would rather make strike threats than constructively engage at the bargaining table," says Chief Administrative Officer Marc Reed; "We do not take strike threats lightly," said Bob Mudge, president of Verizon's wireline network operations. Perhaps it is time for Verizon to focus on its core business and recall that an educated and happy workforce is what sustained VZ for decades ( Bells prior) and that FiOS installs are so superior over cable and so forth do to such a workforce. The reason America is failing is because of demented management that focuses on get rich quick schemes such as "buying Yahoo" rather then their core business.   While VZ management continues to enrich themselves - they threaten off shoring as a viable solution.. really? As Donald Trump points out, "Make America Great Again." This VZ issue is one of many examples that show how greed is gutting America and giving our adversaries our technology and secrets. When a company hurts American workers - they hurt America.   Eventually, it will hurt that company when there isn't anyone left to buy their products. By no means do I agree the unions should demand outrageous requests and both sides need to weigh what is best for the common good of the company, its' future and for the country in which they operate and made their money from. We once had the best telecommunications system in the world and a brain trust called Bell Labs - our Nation was the best in the world. It can be again - when nonsense like this stops. Why do you operate with such a narrow point of view that everyone who is not American has to be our "adversaries". If I remember right, VZ was very interested in selling its wire line business a yr or so ago, but I don't think they could find any takers at their price.  My guess, is that their position hasn't changed, and they would LUV to dump wire line ?
