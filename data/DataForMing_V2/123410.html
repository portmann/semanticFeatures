ETF Hub Fordâ€™s stock price has fallen roughly 12% since the beginning of March due to concerns over growth in China and the new F-150. The auto company has done a great job increasing market share in China even as the country goes through an economic downturn, setting itself up well for the second half. Operations in Europe also appear capable of returning to profitability sooner than expected, with a break-even possibility this year providing huge upside potential. I Know First is bullish about Ford, believing that the upcoming earnings report will act as a positive catalyst for the stock in a rebound from recent months. Ford Motor Co. (NYSE: F ) has struggled along with the rest of the automobile industry so far this year, falling 12% since the beginning of March. The company is set to report its second quarter earnings in a week, and now is a good time for investors to consider adding this stock to their long-term portfolios. The main points that investors should look for in the upcoming earnings report is the company's progress in China gaining market share, its profitability in the European market, and the outlook going forward for the new, aluminum-bodies F-150. All three could act as major catalysts during the rest of 2015, which CEO Mark Fields continues to insist will be a breakout year for the company. China has been viewed as a key part of Ford's future vision, and that remains true today. June sales data for the country released earlier this month showed that new passenger car sales fell 3.4% for the month of June compared to a year ago in China, with Ford experiencing its own 3% decline. The poor auto sales come as China is going through an economic downturn. While sales fell in June, its sales were up marginally during the second half of the year. This is after double digit growth in 2014, though, giving a tough comp for the automaker. Analysts have downgraded their expectations for the market in general for the second half of the year after China's stock market lost approximately $3.2 trillion in value in a crash since a high on June 12th. The loss of value means consumers might be less likely to purchase cars moving forward. While the outlook for China has worsened, Ford is less reliant on the Chinese market than other companies. In fact, the downturn could give the company an opportunity during the second half of the year as it increases its inventory in the market with a new factory and the launch of five new vehicles. Ford has improved its market share so far this year, climbing from number eight in the market to five during the first half of the year, improving its long-term outlook in the world's biggest largest automobile market. Ford has maintained that it expects sales in China to improve during the second half of 2015. If this is the case and June proves to be a one-time event, the stock would quickly trade higher with improved outlooks. Ford has already cut its guidance for China after the first quarter to a realistic goal and should not have to do so again even if China's auto market does remain weak, leaving little risk in the market. Ford is less reliant on China than some of the other major automotive makers at this point and should come out of the economic weakness in the country stronger after releasing new products and increasing capacity. When the Chinese economy recovers, Ford will be in a better position to take advantage of the expanding market for automobiles. Positive comments from Fields and other management will clarify the company's expectations for the rest of 2015 and emphasize the new product launches and momentum. While sales in China for the month of June decreased, they rose 16% for the month in Europe. This outpaced the growth of the overall market as Ford's turnaround plan in the market continues to gain traction. Executives had previously been aiming for a profit in the region in 2015, but Russia made them take a step back and push profitability to 2016. However, the strong turnaround could see the company break even this year and eliminate a drag on the company's profitability. New models including the Mondeo and Kuga helped the company increase its market share in Europe to 8.1%. The new version of the Mondeo is basically a European twin of the Ford Fusion, and its sales have increase 55% since being released compared to a year ago. The auto company is continuing its push of introducing new models in the region during the rest of the year, including the Mustang. It will be released in Europe for the first time this year and should continue the company's momentum in the region. After turning around its operations in North America a clear success story, operations in Europe appear primed to join it. The company's restructuring efforts have been successful leading to better profitability, and the push of introducing new vehicles to the market comes as the company opens one-hundred modern stores by year's end to go with the one-hundred it has already opened. The earnings report and guidance could offer reason to believe that Europe will break even this year, giving a huge boost to the stock price. The new aluminum-bodies F-150 has been in the news recently because of discounts for up to $10,000 for the truck, leading to speculation that demand was not as high as Ford had expected. Obviously, discounts like these are par for the course in the truck industry, with more expensive models getting rebates in certain regions to be priced competitively. In fact, the average incentive for a F-series truck this year is $3,100, or $600 lower than for trucks last year. In addition, the F-150 is selling quickly compared to other trucks, spending an average of 32 days on the lot before being sold. And the average selling price of trucks so far is $44,100, a record high price for Ford. Sales of the model were down in June, but Ford maintains that decreased supply was the cause. With all of the supply issues sorted out and both manufacturing plants working at full capacity, sales should start climbing during the second half of the year in the North American region. The second half of the year is usually weaker for Ford, and increased sales of the new trucks could lead to impressive comps from a year earlier. Expect for sales to jump during the second half of the year and make up for the 9% decline from June, helping the stock price rebound. Analysts tend to agree with the bullish fundamental analysis of the company. Ford's valuation is currently cheap compared to other major players in the industry, with a forward P/E ratio of 9.28. This is in comparison to the industry's average that is in the high 13's. The company also has a dividend yield of 3.77%, solid value for a company in the auto industry that should benefit from lower gas prices and an economic recovery in North America going forward. Analysts have set an average target price of $17.12 for the stock, offering a 17.5% premium over current prices. Eight analysts have set a recommendation of buy or strong buy, while only one has a recommendation of sell. Eleven have a recommendation of hold. Ford has a recent history of beating expectations, surpassing expected earnings in three of the last four quarters by an average of 11.15%. With operations in Europe likely to beat expectations and with guidance for China having already been lowered, it will likely beat them again this quarter. Investors can expect the stock price to jump after earnings as the company's outlook in China continues to improve, operations in Europe signal a return to profitability sooner than expected, and the F-150 drives large profits in North America during the second half of the year. Now is a good opportunity to invest for long-term growth and income, especially while the stock price is still hovering around $14.50.
