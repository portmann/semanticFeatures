Amazon Plunges After Missing Q4 Revenue, Earnings As Concerns Emerge About Future Profitability | Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site!

For years, shorts would tear their hair out quarter after quarter, when AMZN would continue to bleed cash with relentless abandon, only to see the stock soar after earnings. Now, in what may be a perfect poetic symmetry, following the quarter in which Amazon's free cash flow soared to the highest in years, printing at $7.3 billion, or more than triple the year ago period... It wasn't just that: one reason for the 13% plunge may be that in the holiday season in which many had expected that AMZN would take away market share from an imploding retail sector, revenue of $35.7 billion, a 22% increase, actually missed expectations of $35.9 billion, something AMZN has rarely done in the blockbuster for retail spending fourth quarter. Another reason is that Wall Street finally got ahead of itself. By a lot: it was expecting AMZN to generate $1.55 in EPS. Instead, AMZN missed this by a whopping 30%, with a final Q4 EPS of $1.00 (more than doubling the year ago net income), on operating income of $1.1 billion (a nearly 100% increase from a year ago) which also missed expectations of a $1.24 billion number. On the spending side, operating expenses increased 21% to $34.6 billion, making some question if the company's core business profits will not be swept by Bezos' many business growth ideas. The CEO's biggest challenge is balancing Wall Streetâ€™s thirst for profits against his own ambitions of using new technology - such as unmanned drones and intelligent household gadgets. Bezos is also eager to replicate his U.S. success abroad, including challenging Flipkart Online Services Pvt. for Indiaâ€™s fast-growing e-commerce industry. According to Bloomberg , "the result was a surprise for investors who have become accustomed to Amazonâ€™s ability to fuel sales by spending heavily on delivery infrastructure and new products. The key question is whether the Seattle-based company can readjust its investments in the face of weaker than anticipated sales. Still, Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos appears determined to show that Amazon can keep bringing in more profit and sales - he pulled back on spending last year to deliver a surprise jump in earnings and will be showing Amazonâ€™s first Super Bowl commercial next week. "Amazon reached this new level of profitability in 2015 that we hadnâ€™t seen previously," said Kerry Rice, an analyst at Needham & Co. LLC. "If they donâ€™t keep that trend going in the right direction, the stock goes down." For now Amazon is not suffering too much in that regard: Prime memberships rose a whopping 51%, offsetting fears that Amazon's annuity cash flow stream may be throttled. Curiously, not even the silver lining was enough to save AMZN: the company's cloud service, Amazon Web Services, generated sales of $2.41 billion, beating expectations of $2.37 billion, up 69% from the $1.42 billion a year ago, and generating income of $687, an impressive 28% margin, modestly shy of the $1 billion in $1.1 billion in retail profits across all of the company's other profit lines. Finally, not even AMZN's guidance was all that bad: Net sales are expected to be between $26.5 billion and $29.0 billion, or to grow between 17% and 28% compared with first quarter 2015. This compares with consensus expectations of $27.6 billion. Operating income is expected to be between $100 million and $700 million, compared with $255 million in first quarter 2015. Wall Street expects $658 million So yes, a good quarter, but not good enough, and one in which now that AMZN has entered profitability mode, suddenly expectations exist that this profit growth can sustain, and - judging by the crash in AMZN's price - that they won't. Meanwhile, AMZN continues to grow and grow and grow, perhaps too much for its own good: as the chart below shows, while worldwide growth once again took a leg down, the number of employees at AMZN has now grown to an epic 230,800 up from "only" 154,100 a year ago.

The stock was up $80 in one week on the back of ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!!! The past $300 has been total bullshit. But nobody cares. Nobody investigates the accounting, nobody audits the books. Thu, 01/28/2016 - 16:41 | 7110532 L Bean Amazon is soviet in nature, much like Wal-Mart. There outta be an index, for all it reflects on the real state of The Folks.  Thu, 01/28/2016 - 16:42 | 7110534 VW Nerd Amazon is suddenly unable to shrug off earnings??  Until now, funds were willing to throw money at this company with a P/E in excess of 200 without batting an eye.  Now it matters??  Crazy....

Trump Some folks got Amazoned today.  I'm tired of hearing those phrases but it seemed appropriate.  The fuckers announced a music service to spike the share price right before announcing their quarter cause they knew it would tank it.

Thu, 01/28/2016 - 16:49 | 7110563 NoWayJose Amazon had a chance to be profitable using massive warehouses, a well thought out web site to display products and get customers to buy things they don't need, and an efficient mailing system.  Instead, they expand into one hour delivery with high overhead.  Walmart is closing these smaller close-to-the-customer stores because of low profits and high costs.  Amazon is attempting a similar thing - but is ADDING the overhead for delivery!  The model is doomed.

They actually invested in the business and are trying for longer-term growth. This simply shows how bullshit wall street and being public is. Thu, 01/28/2016 - 16:56 | 7110579 brada1013567 How do you tell people your the guy who bought it up $52 at the close. That's kinda like saying hey I am insane. Thu, 01/28/2016 - 16:54 | 7110584 moonmac THE COMPANY HAS NEVER TURNED A PROFIT!!!!! THEY ARE STILL BILLIONS IN THE HOLE FROM 20 YEARS OF OPERATING LOSSES. Just because they turned a minuscule profit during a few quarters in the past 20 years doesn't mean the company is profitable or will ever be. Hello LA LA LAND, I'd like a ticket to enter please because I'm sick and tired of living in reality.
