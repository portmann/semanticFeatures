Apple: Nikkei Declares iPhone 7 Dead Before Arrival - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Nikkei has claimed a lack of innovation and groundbreaking features in the upcoming iPhone 7. Based on this, Nikkei produced a prediction that amounts to greater than a 30% decline in iPhone sales in the second half of the year. It would be very unusual for Apple not to feature a complete redesign of the iPhone for this new generation. A report from Nikkei on May 12 bemoans the "bleak year" that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) suppliers face due to "weak iPhone 7 demand." How has the Nikkei determined demand for something that isn't yet available? Apparently, this is to be inferred from the iPhone 7's "lack of innovation and groundbreaking features" as the Nikkei puts it. I wish I had the Nikkei's crystal ball. In fairness, the Nikkei isn't the only media outlet trashing the iPhone 7 in advance of its release. iP7 has become a favorite target of Apple critics. SA contributor Paulo Santos has pointed to what he terms " credible leaks " to substantiate his view that the iPhone 7 will be little different from the iPhone 6s, thereby putting iP7 sales at risk. I think we can concede that if the iP7 looks almost like iPhone 6s, sales will probably tank. But I don't blame Apple so much as the lack of imagination of the various rumor sites. This year's crop of purported drawings, photos, and CAD renderings of the new iPhone is the most derivative yet. Take, for example, the mockup of the iPhone 7 from MacRumors shown above, which is a straightforward Photoshop touch-up that doesn't change anything except eliminate the antenna bands across the back and flatten the camera bulge. In addition to the lack of creativity, there seems to be even less consistency. Does the camera bulge get better or worse? According to this photo, it gets much worse with a rumored two-camera system (also from MacRumors): The main problem I have with the current crop of rumors is that it doesn't take into account recent iPhone history. With every new number generation (4, 5, 6) there has been a complete redesign, as opposed to "s" generations (4s, 5s, 6s) that mainly featured internal upgrades. The current iP7 rumors assume a departure from this in which the design is only slightly different. Instead, it's assumed that 2017 is the year that gets the radical redesign, even though that would be an "s" year. The rumors attribute a level of stupidity to Apple that I find a little implausible. Here, Apple is under the gun, with declining iPhone sales and market share in the March quarter, yet the rumors have Apple spitting out a blah iPhone remake. Apple has plenty of cash to throw at the problem, so I can't see them sitting on their hands. A fresh design is the least Apple can do. I say that at the risk of being a little too design focused. Samsung's ( OTC:SSNLF ) Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge were almost identical to last year's models, yet this wasn't seen as cause for concern. Well, we all know Apple gets held to a higher standard. In addition to trashing the iPhone 7 for its lack of innovation, the Nikkei report produced what appears to be some very bad arithmetic. The report quoted an unidentified source that chip sales at TSMC (NYSE: TSM ) to Apple could decline 20-30% in the second half of the year compared to 2015. This estimate is very problematic since TSMC is thought to be the sole supplier for the "A10" SOC in the iPhone 7 series, whereas it split the business for the A9 SOC in the iPhone 6s series with Samsung. The split was thought to be about 60% for TSMC . In my article on the Apple/TSMC partnership last January, I estimated total processor shipments for the second half of 2014 and 2015 (the iPhone 6 vs. the 6s production ramps). I estimated total processor shipments by TSMC to Apple in 2015 H2 to be 95.9 million units. Now, there are a lot of puts and takes in this, but the estimate accounts for the approximate 60/40 split, as well as the fact that TSMC was the sole source for the A8 SOC in the iPhone 6 series. If the Nikkei is right, then shipments will fall at least 20% to 76.72 million. With TSMC the sole source on the iPhone 7, and probably on residual A9 production for the iPhone 6s and SE, the 76.7 million becomes roughly equivalent to total iPhone sales for the second half of 2016. This assumes that the iP6 will be discontinued, leaving just iPhones that use either the A9 or A10 SOCs. Last year, Apple sold a total of 122.82 million iPhones in the second half, so this would be a decline of 38% y/y. If Nikkei is assuming that Samsung is still co-producing the A9, that helps, but it still points to a large decline, since the bulk of sales in the second half will be the new A10 for the iPhone 7. Assuming that A9 chips account for about 20% of what Apple will consume, with the rest being A10, then Samsung's share would be about 6.67 million units, bringing the total Apple would consume to 83.4 million. The y/y unit decline in iPhone sales would still be about 32%. No matter how I massage the numbers, Nikkei's prediction ends up amounting to a huge y/y sales decline for the iPhone. I don't think we're going to see anything like that in the second half. The dire predictions of the iPhone 7 failure are of course terribly self-serving for Apple bears. It's also a sort of preemptive attack on the brand, where such predictions can become self-fulfilling. With so much buzz being generated about the iPhone decline, this has the potential to influence consumer buying decisions. And Apple is facing stiffer competition than ever before, from companies such as Samsung, Huawei and Xiaomi (Private: XI ). Apple definitely needs to up its game this year. The rumors tend to support the proposition that Apple is going to fail to do that. If the rumors prove true and the iPhone 7 is as undistinguished as expected, I would definitely feel the need for regime change at Apple. But I'm certainly not to that point, yet. I'm willing to give current management the benefit of the doubt until we see the real product. I remain long Apple and recommend it as a buy for investors with a 3-5 year investment horizon.
