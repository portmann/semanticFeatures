Gilead Sciences Reminds Me Of Apple Circa June 2013 - Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) | Seeking Alpha After rising some 150% in less than three years, the stock of Gilead Sciences has been stuck in a relatively tight trading range for approximately nine months. The recent pause in the appreciation of shares is likely to be temporary given their cheap valuations, and the company's stranglehold on two key markets and increasing free cash flow. In many ways, the stock of Gilead reminds me of where Apple was in June of 2013 when no one cared about its cheap valuation or growth prospects. Building a position in this biotech juggernaut is as likely to provide shareholders with similar gains once the stock of Gilead breaks out of its recent rut. I have held stock in Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ: GILD ) for just over three years now. The shares are up some 150% over that time frame, but the stock has been stuck in a relatively tight trading range for nine months now as even long-term value investors seem to be growing a little impatient here. I have made a bit of coin by selling just out-of-the-money bull put spreads every time the shares go into the mid-$90s, but I have to admit I am starting to get a bit frustrated with the length of this consolidation phase. Holding Gilead here kind of reminds me of pounding the table for Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) in the second quarter of 2013 only to see the stock continue to go down before finally hitting its nadir at under $400 a share (before its seven-to-one split). In fact, the shares of Gilead remind of Apple two years ago for several reasons. Back in June of 2013, Apple was trading at approximately 10 times earnings in a market that was going for around 16 times trailing earnings. Gilead currently sells at just over 12 times trailing earnings in an overall market that is trading at ~18.5 times trailing earnings. Back in the second quarter of 2013, the story line in the mainstream financial press was that Apple had lost its "mojo" and Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) was in ascendance in the smart phone space given its market share lead and possessing larger screens that Apple did not offer yet. It proved to be a false narrative. Currently, despite almost quadrupling its earnings in 2014, no one believes Gilead can maintain its momentum and that competition in the hepatitis C space will heat up. So far, the Viekera Pak from AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV ) seems to meeting underwhelming response in the hep C space. Sovaldi/Harvoni should continue to see solid growth, and Sovaldi was just approved in Japan for certain hepatitis C types. The Land of the Rising Sun has some one million citizens with some form of hepatitis C and represents another lucrative market. The company is barely getting started in the European Union with these drug roll-outs as well. One of the main criticisms of Apple for years was that it sat on a huge and growing cash hoard that totaled north of $160 billion at one time. Pushed by activists, the company initiated a dividend and has bought back a massive amount of stock over the years. This was one of the keys to the stock's huge rally over the past 18 months, and in 2014, the company spent an astounding ~$65 billion in stock buybacks and dividend payouts. Taking a page from Apple's PlayBook, Gilead recently announced that it will pay its first dividend ever, which will provide the stock with better-than-1.5% yield, enticing investors that like a bit of yield with their equity investments. In addition, the company will buy back some $15 billion worth of stock over the next few years, which would retire ~10% of its outstanding float at current levels. The company can easily do this with its balance sheet. Gilead has no net debt and should throw off $10 billion to $15 billion in free cash flow in 2015 and $60 billion to $70 billion over the next five years. Back when Apple had lost its "mojo" and sentiment was beyond bearish, investors missed how powerful the Apple ecosystem was; something that has been enhanced even further by Apple Pay and the coming roll-out of the Apple Watch. Investors seem to be missing that Gilead has a stranglehold and is the market share leader in two of the more lucrative areas of disease management; HIV and hep C. This does not even take into account the other drugs in its product portfolio or its substantial pipeline. Earnings per share should be up 15% to 20% in 2015 year over year and 10% to 15% in 2016 according to the current consensus. Once Gilead proves that hepatitis C will be a continuing blockbuster franchise, sentiment should start to improve dramatically on the stock. I would not be surprised to see a similar rally to what Apple has been able to achieve over the past 18 months when that shift occurs. Until then, patient long-term value investors just need to bide their time. STRONG BUY Source: Gilead Sciences Reminds Me Of Apple Circa June 2013 Disclosure: The author is long GILD, AAPL, ABBV.
