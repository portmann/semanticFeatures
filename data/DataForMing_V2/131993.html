The Market Is Missing The Long-Term Story On Boeing - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha BA reported earnings last week, and the results were excellent. But the stock continues to languish, and I think it is because investors are too focused on the short term. I've been a bull on aerospace giant Boeing (NYSE: BA ) for some time now, as I like the stock's long-term fundamentals, and the renewed focus on capital returns by the management team make it all the more enticing. Most recently, I detailed how I thought the stock was cheap at $146. Obviously, we've moved down marginally since that time, but we also received the company's Q2 earnings report last week. In light of what has happened since I last visited Boeing, I'll use this article to take a fresh look at the company's fundamentals and its valuation. To do this, I'll use a DCF-type model you can read more about here . The model uses several inputs, including earnings estimates, which I've borrowed from Yahoo , dividends, which I've set to grow at 18% annually, and a discount rate, which I've set at the 5-year Treasury rate plus a risk premium of 7%. We can see the model is quite bullish, producing a fair value of $165. That would indicate that BA is cheap on a fundamental basis but let's take a look at the underlying business to see what we can learn. In short, Boeing's Q2 was really quite good. The company posted a wide beat on the top and bottom lines on underlying strength in its business. Not only did the Commercial Airplanes business soar, but the company managed to buy back roughly 2% of the float during the quarter. I detailed Boeing's terrific free cash flow in relation to its dividend and buyback earlier this year, and that strength is shining through in a big way through a reduced float. Boeing's order backlog is also still strong at nearly half a trillion dollars, although it did slip during the quarter. Despite the slip in the backlog, I have zero concerns for Boeing's long-term demand picture as it continues to ink huge deals like FedEx (NYSE: FDX ), as Boeing is still widely respected in the aviation world; there is no lack of demand for Boeing's products, and if anything, Boeing's capacity is holding it back. Boeing issued soft guidance during its Q2 report, but that was because of a 77 cent charge in relation to its KC-46 tanker program. The plane's fuel system needs an overhaul, and that is costing Boeing dearly, but that is something that happens in an extraordinarily complicated business like building airplanes. This is a one-time charge, and it is part of the deal with owning Boeing, so I don't even really care. The tanker is on schedule for delivery, and that is all that matters; this is a hiccup. It has happened before, and it will happen again. If you strip out the noise of the tanker charge, Boeing actually increased its guidance for this year, and that means the stock is a little cheaper than it was on a core earnings basis. One-time charges should be ignored if they are truly one-time charges, and the fuel system hiccup is something that should be ignored. Boeing continues to post terrific FCF, and that allows it to not only pay a robust dividend but buy back lots of stock. The company repurchased $2 billion worth of shares in Q2, and still has $7.5 billion left on its authorization. That's good for nearly 8% of the current float, and when you combine a large share reduction like that with strong fundamentals, you get a stock that is very cheap. Turning to the chart, I see a couple of things that make me thing BA is near a short-term bottom. First, the stock is approaching a rising 200-DMA. That should provide some support as we are only a couple of ticks away. If we get a few days of selling that leaves the stock markedly below the 200-DMA, that would be a sign of trouble, but for now, it looks like it should support the stock. Likewise, there is strong longer-term support in the $135-140 area, as BA topped out there three times in the last two years. Since then, the stock broke out of its trading range and that area - the top of the former trading range - should act as support. In conjunction with the rising 200-DMA I see a lot of really strong support in the $135-140 area. Finally, the short-term channel we've seen as the stock has fallen from its highs to its current levels looks like a bull flag to me. If you look at the longer-term chart, the breakout from the former trading range that occurred earlier this year is the "pole" of the flag, and that would indicate that BA is pausing while it gathers strength for the next leg up. I firmly believe the flag I see here is a continuation pattern, and since the trend is up, that bodes well for the stock. I like BA very much here. The combination of strong fundamentals, huge capital returns, strong FCF and a very favorable chart setup means BA looks like a great long candidate here. In fact, I've gotten long BA here, as I love the fundamental story and the fact that the stock is so cheap at only 15 times forward earnings. The chart setup is just icing on the cake, and it all means that I think we'll see BA higher in the next couple of quarters.
