Apple: Big Opportunity To Create Value In Mobile Payments - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple Pay revenues will probably never impress the market. The benefit exists in the high margins and value creation of eventually controlling mobile payments. Apple remains a cheap stock with a big catalyst in Apple Pay that could help boost the PE ratio due to the recurring nature of payments fees. When Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) originally released details on a mobile payments system about six months ago called Apple Pay, most of the analysis focused on the revenue potential. Analysts quickly calculated the revenue opportunity based on Apple obtaining a small fee from each transaction and the numbers didn't impress. For a company with a market cap in excess of $700 billion and revenue expected to exceed $225 billion this year, the prospects for a business line with revenues in the millions weren't that exciting. Is it possible that investors are reviewing the wrong metric and overlooking the value of the players that control the payment networks? While researching the potential for IBM (NYSE: IBM ) to disrupt the payment networks with a digital cash blockchain similar to what bitcoin uses, the stat that kept sticking out is the valuation of the two major payment networks. Right now, Visa (NYSE: V ) and MasterCard (NYSE: MA ) are worth a staggering $245 billion combined. This amount is significant enough for Apple to benefit shareholders from disrupting the related business lines. If one goes back to revenues, the market isn't that exciting with Visa targeting revenue of $13.8 billion this year and MasterCard only $10.1 billion. Clearly, if Apple was to put both out of business and take all of their revenue, it would hardly amount to 10% of the current annual revenue. The combined market caps though stick out at nearly 35% of where Apple sits as the most valuable company in the world. These valuations don't even factor in the amounts derived from the payment networks of American Express (NYSE: AXP ) and Discover Financial Services (NYSE: DFS ) that have combined market caps of around $100 billion. A portion of these businesses obtain value from being the issuing bank and collecting the related fees and interest income on loan balances. The reason that Visa and MasterCard have such incredible valuations are the respective operating margins that put Apple to shame. AAPL Operating Margin (TTM) data by YCharts Not only do the payment networks generate double the margins of Apple, but the revenue stream is recurring. Visa doesn't have to create the best new phone each and every year in order to generate outsized profits. In that regard, the market rewards the payment processors with a market value over three times larger for each dollar of revenue generated. The biggest difference with competing mobile payment networks are the estimated 2% merchant fees charged by banks. The major retailers are developing the CurrentC payment system to avoid the fees and Apple Pay is working directly with the banks. The fact Apple is working with the banks helped usher the technology into existence while it is preventing the acceptance at some major retailers that back the CurrentC system including Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) and CVS (NYSE: CVS ). Right now, Apple Pay collects a small fee from the issuing banks estimated at only 0.15%. At that rate, it takes $1 trillion worth of spending on the mobile payment service to produce $1.5 billion in revenue. Even assuming a similar PS multiple obtained by MasterCard, the generated revenue would only add $15 billion to market value of Apple. Considering Visa and MasterCard process about $3.2 trillion in annual transactions, the $1 trillion estimate is probably the current potential opportunity for Apple with the limited retailers accepting the payment option and the lack of consumer availability due to the limitation to the newest Apple products. The possible scenario is that Apple figures out a way to push the payment networks out of the process. Either it could partner with IBM on the digital cash concept and increase the fees it collects or create its own network to supplant Visa and MasterCard. The opportunities appear limitless and the market valuation up for grabs is enormous with the majority of the world still using physical cash. A lot of the surveys such as the one from pymnts.com suggest that the majority of iPhone 6 users don't use Apple Pay. Though the survey does suggest that the amount of users continues to increase from the original survey in November. Considering just about everybody uses credit cards, the fact that 85% of users of an iPhone 6 haven't tried Apple Pay appears concerning. The good news is that the number of users in March increased slightly to 6% from the original 5%. The bad news is that the amount of users that tried it and weren't using it jumped to 9%. If the level of users doesn't increase, merchants aren't likely to take the steps to accept it. At the same time, Wal-Mart and CVS might become more emboldened to continue with the competing technology. The good news is that companies like OpenTable and Cover have seen a boost from accepting Apple Pay via their apps. In fact, Cover reported that 21% of diners with an iPhone 6 at upscale restaurants selected to use Apple Pay. The analysis is that investors are looking at Apple Pay in the wrong light. It isn't the amount of revenue it generates but the impact it can have on market value. Investors need to view mobile payments in the light of the 60% operating margins of Visa, compared to the current 30% operating margins of a mostly hardware business of Apple. And more importantly, the revenue generated by Visa and MasterCard is three times more valuable than what the most valuable company in the word currently produces. Ultimately, Apple needs to up the fee ratio obtained from Apple Pay transactions in order for a material impact to the stock. While Apple Pay is definitely not assured success based on user data and the inherent issue with the requirement for having a new Apple product such as the iPhone 6 or upcoming Apple Watch to even gain access, the key is that the product actually provides a catalyst to the stock. The opportunity to add value to a stock valued at over $700 billion is clearly bigger than most people think at first glance. The stock remains a core holding with an enterprise value of roughly 10x forecasted earnings and a catalyst in Apple Pay to grow value.
