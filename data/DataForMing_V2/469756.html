Verizon: Still Worth Owning After Yahoo Acquisition - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha Verizon posted disappointing quarterly earnings and the deal for Yahoo was met with a tepid response. This could lure investors into questioning whether Verizon is still worth owning. It is important to tune out the short-term noise and focus on the bigger picture: Verizon is massively profitable with huge free cash flow. The Yahoo deal is relatively minor, given Verizon's huge size and scale. And, it is likely to provide some growth to the company. Verizon's 4% dividend and annual dividend growth should still be attractive to income investors in a world of very low interest rates. In the aftermath of the major deal just announced by Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ ) to takeover certain assets of Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ: YHOO ), the big question for investors is what, if anything, should be done. The acquisition received a mixed response, and Verizon's quarterly earnings report released on July 26 did not help matters much. At $54, Verizon stock has significantly outperformed the market in both the year-to-date and trailing one-year periods. Given the excellent performance of the stock, investors could be lured into thinking right now is a good time to take profits and run. But there are still many reasons to continue owning Verizon stock. First and foremost is its dividend. Even though Verizon stock has run up this year, up approximately 21% year-to-date based on its July 25 closing price, which has brought down its dividend yield to 4%, it is still among the highest-yielding stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. In an environment of historically low interest rates, Verizon provides income investors with valuable income in a market where safe yield is hard to find. And, Verizon remains a cash cow. The deal for Yahoo is a relative drop in the bucket compared to the size and strength of Verizon's core businesses. The company generates billions of free cash flow each year, which it will use to steadily increase its dividend over time. For long-term income investors, ignore the noise, and continue to hold Verizon. As investors know, two years ago Verizon purchased the remaining 45% stake in Verizon Wireless from Vodafone (NASDAQ: VOD ) that it didn't already own. While the deal carried a huge price tag for Verizon--$130 billion to be exact-it was well worth the cost. The reason is because Verizon Wireless is a cash machine. Last year , Verizon realized growth rates from its wireless business that set it apart from its peers. For example, the company grew revenue by 3.6% last year, which is an impressive growth rate for a slow-and-steady telecom. Its growth was led by the wireless business, which posted 4.6% revenue growth last year and carried a 42.5% EBITDA margin. It is clear that Verizon Wireless is both highly profitable and growing. This leads to massive free cash flow. Just last year, Verizon generated $21.2 billion of free cash flow. With such huge levels of free cash flow, the company rewards investors with a dividend that is sustainable over the long term. Last year, Verizon's dividend totaled $8.5 billion, which amounts to just 40% of its annual free cash flow. A free cash flow payout ratio of below 50% is modest, and leaves plenty of room for continued dividend growth each year. Some investors may not be pleased with the decision to buy Yahoo, but the acquisition does offer growth potential. At some point, growth in wireless will slow, as the wireless industry in the U.S. is all but saturated. That means it is important for Verizon to pursue new avenues for growth, and digital advertising is one of them. Even though Yahoo's search and mail services are in decline, it still has more than 1 billion monthly active users, including 600 million monthly active mobile users. Yahoo also has valuable advertising technology. The real value for Verizon will be that it can use Yahoo's existing technology to enhance its media and advertising businesses. This was also the rationale for Verizon's 2015 deal to acquire AOL for $4.4 billion. The other key factor to keep in mind is that even if the Yahoo deal turns out to be a disaster, it is a relative drop in the bucket for Verizon. At $4.83 billion, the price tag is minimal compared to Verizon's existing cash on hand and free cash flow. As of the end of last quarter, Verizon held $2.8 billion just in cash on the balance sheet. That covers more than half of the acquisition right there, and consider that Verizon generated $5.5 billion of free cash flow in just the past two quarters combined. Verizon is also getting dinged because of its lackluster second-quarter earnings report , which showed that revenue declined 5% year over year and missed analyst expectations. But to focus on this would lead investors into a false reading-Verizon's drop in year over year revenue was due mostly to the worker strike. Since the strike has been settled, last quarter's dud will simply be a one-time occurrence. Revenue in the wireless business dipped last quarter, but the company actually increased EBITDA margin yet again, by another 130 basis points. This is a testament to Verizon's high-quality customer base in wireless. Verizon is showing a few cracks in its armor in recent days, but don't be fooled by the short-term noise. Long-term investors should keep focus on what matters, namely Verizon's excellent free cash flow and dividend. The reasons why the stock has performed so well over the past year-specifically, its excellent wireless business and future growth opportunities in digital advertising-remain intact. The recent disappointment over last quarter's earnings will fade, because the factors that led to the decline in earnings are short-term. Income investors should continue to own Verizon stock and collect its rising dividends. Disclaimer: This article represents the opinion of the author, who is not a licensed financial advisor.
