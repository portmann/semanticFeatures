A Strong Lead For Boeing On The Freighter Market - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Boeing freighter orders in 2015 lifted in by FedEx mega order. Recovery on cargo market not robust enough for solid order inflow for the Boeing 747-8F. In my previous articles I had a look at narrow body order inflow and passenger wide body order inflow . The only order inflow missing is that for freighter aircraft, which will be subject of this article. Figure 1: Freighter order inflow for Boeing and Airbus in 2015 (Source: AeroAnalysis.net ) First of all, what is obvious is that this market is Boeing's (NYSE: BA ). Boeing has 3 aircraft types to serve the freighter market, while Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSF ) only has 1. This already means that Boeing has higher chances to receive freighter orders, solely due to the fact that they offer a more complete freighter product line. Airbus received just 4 out of the 75 orders for freighters. Boeing orders were boosted by a mega order from FedEx (NYSE: FDX ), fully owned by FedEx, in fact all orders placed for the Boeing 767-300F come from FedEx. The order inflow for the Boeing 767-300F shows that the aircraft has a sweet spot on the market and is working for the biggest cargo airline. Boeing received 6 orders for the Boeing 747-8I, but also had to swallow 4 cancellations leaving the Boeing 747-8F with 2 orders. At the same time the 2 orders were 'filled' by white tails. So it can be concluded that up until now the Air Bridge Cargo commitment did not help Boeing. While Boeing received 6 orders in 2015, it did not help Boeing filling delivery slots. The Boeing 777F on the hand received 16 orders. While the low order inflow for the Boeing 747-8F is blamed on slow recovery on the cargo market, I do think that the Boeing 777F is also eating away orders from the Boeing 747-8F. The Boeing orders have a catalogue value of $17bn, but after standard discounts this is closer to $8.3bn. The 4 A330F aircraft are worth $938.8 mln at list prices, after discounts the value is closer to $375.5 mln. On the freighter market Boeing does not seem to have any competitors, but does face some challenges due to slow recovery on the cargo market. The Boeing 767F and Boeing 777F did have some solid order inflow in 2015, but the Boeing 747-8F is facing serious difficulties that will be there as long as recovery of the cargo will not pick up pace. All in all Boeing has no competition on the freighter market and once recovery picks up pace Boeing's lead will become even more robust. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
