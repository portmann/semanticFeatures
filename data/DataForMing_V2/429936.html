He says heâ€™ll pay for their flight, food and hotel. He says to contact his â€˜agentâ€™ to set everything up.â€? Sorry. We imagine it must be a bummer to learn that you will not be intimate with the man who singlehandedly broke New Jersey’s economy, but take solace in the fact that Florida’s wealthiest man is still single and ready to mingle. And you know so much about him already because your catfisher was apparently quite thorough: The creepy impersonator used an image of Tepper in a Pittsburgh Steelers hat (he is a minority owner of the team) as a profile picture, and also posted a bio befitting New Jerseyâ€™s former richest man, who has since taken his talents to tax-friendly Florida. Sadly, there are no pictures of the â€œluckyâ€? brass balls that are said to sit on Tepperâ€™s office desk. The imposter told one woman via Facebook messenger that he is 58 and lives in Florida, matching the real-life mogul â€” who recently went through an expensive divorce. He also listed his school as the University of Pittsburgh, which the real Tepper attended. But hey, maybe take the weekend and learn to love yourself.
