Here's Why Apple Is Weak Since Earnings - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple stock has been weak since earnings. I find there are two or three possible explanations for this having happened. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) reported FQ2 2015 earnings and they were a monster, beating earnings and revenue expectations by a good deal. Those earnings also prompted a slight increase in EPS estimates going forward, with FQ3 2015 EPS consensus moving from $1.66 per share to $1.74 per share, and even FY2015 and FY2016 as a whole seeing increases as well, as we can see below. So, in this context, why has the stock been so weak? Right before earnings Apple traded for $132.65 per share, and today it's barely holding $124. There is a reason. As everyone knows by now, Apple is the iPhone, and the stock will do as well or as badly as the iPhone does. The iPhone represented 69.4% of Apple's FQ2 revenues, and certainly more than 80% of its earnings. What is less well-known is that the iPhone also represented more than 100% of Apple's revenue growth in FQ2. iPhone revenues grew $14.2 billion year-on-year, whereas Apple's overall revenues grew just $12.4 billion year-on-year. In other words, Apple ex-iPhone actually shrank during FQ2. If anything else was needed to establish that Apple is the iPhone, that ought to do it. Naturally, a company being so reliant on a single product is already a problem which can give investors the shivers. But there's more to Apple's weakness. As we saw, FQ3 guidance already led to raised earnings estimates. So it didn't look that bad. But there's something more to it which I believe also added to investors' fears. It has to do with how Apple has done historically from FQ2 to FQ3. The drop In revenues in the last two years was -19% (2013) and -18% (2014), respectively. Both these years came close to the top end of Apple's revenue guidance (FQ3 2013 came in at $35.3 billion versus $35.5 billion guidance; FQ3 2014 came in at $37.4 billion versus $38 billion guidance). If we assume Apple will meet the high end of its revenue guidance for FQ3 2015 ($48 billion), Apple would show a 17.2% drop from FQ2, so it would even be a bit better than what's usual. It would also show a year-on-year revenue growth rate of 28.3%, which is comparable to what it reported in FQ1 (29.5%) and FQ2 (27.2%). So there wouldn't seem to be anything particularly wrong with FQ3 or the iPhone. But remember, the Apple Watch was launched in FQ3. And launches always bring in quite a few sales. So what happens if we factor 4 million Apple Watch @ a $500 ASP in FQ3, which is not particularly aggressive as it would amount to less than 16 million Apple Watches being sold over a year (since sales will slow from the launch quarter)? (Source: Several Apple earnings reports ) As you can see, FQ3 ex-Apple Watch already looks like declining more than any of the past two years. Moreover, the year-on-year ex-Apple Watch drops steeply to just 23%, which is a lot lower than FQ1 (29.5%) and FQ2 (27.2%). This is probably the main worry about Apple, since it seems to convey that the iPhone 6 is rapidly losing height. This is also confirmed by reports which show Android again gaining share on Apple, though not yet on a year-on-year perspective. Furthermore, it is probable that the iPhone 6 massive success was dictated by it finally embracing larger displays. There was tremendous pent-up demand for a larger display Apple device. It isn't likely that Apple has any comparably attractive feature to deploy in its iPhone 6S. Sure, there will be a better camera (this time probably upping the megapixel count as well), maybe a better display (it's high time the iPhone is full HD all-around), certainly a better SoC. But none of those are game changers the way the larger display was. So come the end of the year, the iPhone 6 will have decelerated more, and the iPhone 6S will be comparing against the high base set by the iPhone 6 and its massive pent-up demand. It probably won't be an easy comparison. The weakness in Apple stock can be explained both by the iPhone's total domination turning Apple into a one product story, and the seemingly impending large deceleration that the iPhone 6 is starting to experience. Furthermore, it's easy to have doubts that Apple will have anything as attractive as the larger display was when it launches the iPhone 6S later in the year. The last time Apple saw revenue growth flag down strongly, the stock suffered mightily. This time it probably won't suffer as much, but it wouldn't be surprising to see the stock struggle given these developments. As a side note, I believe this time the impact won't be so large because the other time around growth funds were heavily exposed to Apple and had to shed it as Apple lost most of its growth. That said, Apple remains an extraordinarily profitable company, with a massive cash hoard and shareholder return policies, as well as with tremendous engineering and design talent. So while one might think weakness will continue, there are certainly much worse companies out there one can bet against.
