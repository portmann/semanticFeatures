Apple: Disable The $0.99 Crystal Ad Block Safari Extension - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Top grossing Crystal Ad Block Safari browser extension is causing problems on some sites. Enabling Crystal ad blocking on Safari will render e-commerce sites incorrectly. Apple has a quick fix. Users can just long-press the refresh icon on iOS Safari to quickly disable ad blocking browser extensions. I know for a fact that my $0.99 Crystal ad block extension for Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iOS 9 Safari is instantly detected and blocked by smart advertising-dependent websites like hackintosh.zone. I already discussed the possibility of website administrators coding a few lines of PHP/Javascript to quickly deny access to their site content to mobile Safari users who enabled ad blocking extensions. I am not an iOS app developer but, unlike the doom & gloom of fellow Seeking Alpha contributor Mark Hibben, I was already dismissive of the impact/relevance of ad blocking's future on mobile Safari. Web programmers are smarter than we all give them credit for. Once site administrators notice a significant drop in their ad revenue because Apple is allowing ad-blocking on iOS Safari, they will eventually implement a block-the-ad, blocker-user policy. I previously warned Seeking Alpha readers that third-party extensions for Safari would cause some problems for iOS device users. It is happening now. The reality that Apple is getting a 30% cut from the top-grossing Crystal ad block Safari extension makes it partly responsible for what is happening now. Crystal is making a mess out of some e-commerce sites for Safari users. People who bought Crystal and enabled it are now going to have a horrible experience when they try shopping on their favorite online e-commerce sites. Crystal users will find the online stores of Wal-mart (NYSE: WMT ), Sears (NASDAQ: SHLD ), and Lulemon (NASDAQ: LULU ) unavailable and/or rendered incorrectly with dead links and incomplete content. As per the above-linked Fortune article, buying and enabling ad block extensions is disastrous for users and online store operators alike. Just look at the screenshot below, enabling Crystal on Sears.com serves a blank home page. Fortune's investigation of this disaster forced Crystal developer Dean Murphy to issue a statement that he will soon whitelist select e-commerce sites. He only said select - not some, not majority, not all. Apple's continuing approval of a website-murdering paid browser extension apps is not going to endear it to big-budget digital advertisers like Wal-mart and Sears. Apple has a little-known quick fix for the issues ad blockers will cause for iPhone/iPad web surfers. The trick is to just long-press the refresh button to get the option to reload inaccessible sites by disabling ad-blocking extensions like Crystal. However, I suspect a majority of iOS 9 device owners doesn't know of this easy solution. The danger now is for big online commerce operators to suffer a big drop in their sales due to iOS device owners not being able to access their sites properly. Unless Dean Murphy and other ad block developers on iOS come up with a solution for this quandary, Apple is likely to get a bad rep among e-commerce site owners. This is worse than the malware-in-iOS-apps scandal in China. At least we all long knew Apple doesn't have the best kind of online security for its iOS device users. The fact that Apple is approving and profiting from ad blockers that might cause billions of dollars of lost sales to online stores is a worse PR disaster in the making. Angry online marketers are unlikely to ever use iAd to promote their products and get site referrals to their online stores. The ad block-using iPhone/iPad online shopper, who doesn't know the long-press the refresh button solution on Safari, will find himself unable to shop at some e-commerce sites. What could happen next is this frustrated user will then just go and use his Android phone/tablet to shop. The other way of disabling Crystal is to go iOS 9 Settings, Safari, Content Blockers, and disable Crystal. This four-step method is not very user friendly for impatient online shopping iPhone/iPad users. I urge Apple to reconsider its support of ad blocking on iOS 9 Safari. It might also be prudent for it to take down Crystal while the developer is still unable to fix the incorrect rendering of e-commerce sites. The 30% cut from $0.99 apps is minuscule compared to the billions that Apple gets from Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) for making it the default search on iOS 9 Safari. While it is noble of Apple to let its users have the choice to disable Crystal to allow ads on Safari mobile browsing, Tim Cook should crack down on for-profit app developers who submit bug-ridden ad blockers. Provoking hurt feelings from Crystal-affected online e-commerce sites is a bad move for Apple. If I am an online shop owner that sees reduced purchases because Apple approved an ad blocker that prevented iPad/iPhone users from buying from my store, I would be stupid not to boycott Apple devices and services. AAPL is no longer a Buy for me. AAPL was 30% of my 2015 portfolio but I'm gradually reducing my exposure to it. I'm a retired employee of the advertising/marketing industry. I still have friends there who intensely dislike Apple's support for greedy ad block developers. I am one of the millions of graphic designers/creative professionals who salute Marco Arment, maker of the $2.99 Peace ad-block iOS 9 Safari extension. Arment withdrew his app and refunded buyers of his former no.1 top grossing iOS app. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
