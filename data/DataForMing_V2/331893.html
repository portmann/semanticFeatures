WhatsApp: Facebook's Next Platinum Mine? - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha The WhatsApp acquisition was a significant milestone for Facebook because of its fast-growing mobile user base. Now, however, the company's sights are on WhatsApp's ability to be monetized the way Facebook is. Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) has spent nearly $23 billion on two acquisitions, and brought two major social media applications into its fold. I think the time has come for the company to start capitalizing on those pillars. The WhatsApp buy was a huge move as Facebook shelled out an enormous $22 billion to buy the messaging app that boasted 400 million users and $10 million in revenues. The price-to-sale of WhatsApp was 2,200, but the transaction was never meant to be based on the monetization aspect of the then-five-year-old WhatsApp business; rather, it was based on the number of users, its growth rate and, more importantly, the ability to connect to a huge user base via mobile. After reaching the milestone of one billion users recently, WhatsApp broke the news that it will be doing away with the 99-cent subscription fee it was charging its users after one year of free usage. We're happy to announce that WhatsApp will no longer charge subscription fees. For many years, we've asked some people to pay a fee for using WhatsApp after their first year. As we've grown, we've found that this approach hasn't worked well. Many WhatsApp users don't have a debit or credit card number and they worried they'd lose access to their friends and family after their first year. So over the next several weeks, we'll remove fees from the different versions of our app and WhatsApp will no longer charge you for our service. Naturally, people might wonder how we plan to keep WhatsApp running without subscription fees and if today's announcement means we're introducing third-party ads. The answer is no. Starting this year, we will test tools that allow you to use WhatsApp to communicate with businesses and organizations that you want to hear from. That could mean communicating with your bank about whether a recent transaction was fraudulent, or with an airline about a delayed flight. If it is not going to let businesses advertise, then how is it planning to monetize its platforms? The only way possible is to charge businesses for access to thousands or possibly millions of users. How effective this will be remains to be seen. For example, why would a company pay a premium to be able to talk to its customers on WhatsApp? Is chat and telephony integration really worth that much to a company when other options are already available - like well-integrated Customer Relationship Management systems? Is WhatsApp positioning itself to be another CRM tool - in which case the competition is stiff and entry is prohibitive to a great extent? My previous article on Facebook was about how the company was nearing a plateau in growth in core markets that are its most profitable ones. That's exactly why I believe its valuation is unjustified at this point. And that's also the exact reason why WhatsApp needs to have a solid strategy to make money that will ultimately go into FB's bottom line. Essentially, what Facebook has is not millions of users on a new application, but the application itself. WhatsApp is pure mobile, which means it is designed to be used for mobile phones and devices. Think about that for a minute. Companies spend tens of thousands of dollars developing mobile applications, because of what? Because they want to connect with their customers and prospects in new ways. They want more engagement and more sales, to put it simply. Enter Facebook, which can now offer companies a way to get their hands on potentially millions of prospects on an existing mobile application with over a billion users! There's tremendous value in that. Granted, FB may not go with native advertising for this platform because that model has failed before, but this is what I think it's going for: WhatsApp users are given the option to connect with businesses of their choice and receive custom alerts and notifications about specific offers, products and so on. Facebook then charges businesses a per-user fee as long as that user is connected to that business through WhatsApp. In essence, it would be like a cost-per-click arrangement, except that in this case the "click" is a user being connected to a business. The difference here is that this model is personalized, non-intrusive and completely under the control of the user - unlike most third-party ad platforms. In fact, if integrated with a payment system, it could be a viable entry for FB into the highly competitive - but hugely lucrative - e-commerce marketplace domain. Facebook licenses an Enterprise version of WhatsApp for businesses to connect with prospects who are already in the network. Similar to the first scenario, but here the business has more control over who it connects with. Essentially, it would be like a SaaS model where the business pays a monthly fee for access to the application. It can advertise on other platforms (even Facebook, in which case that's more revenue for FB) for people to join its WhatsApp group. Like Facebook groups, this would be an alternate platform of communication where it operates like a chat/phone service for customers and prospects to quickly connect with a company representative. Despite what it has said about not getting into third-party advertising on WhatsApp, the fact remains that people using WhatsApp are highly reliant on it for a lot of their group communication. In exchange for a little bit of real estate space on users' mobile screens, FB can attract premium businesses to advertise using ads that are relevant to the demographic of that group or user. Another supporting fact for this premise is that FB's monetizing expertise falls squarely in this domain. This is from a report on VentureBeat : Jan Koum says the company will experiment with the monetization opportunities to be found connecting companies with their customers. While he admitted WhatsApp hasn't really settled on the final plan yet, and has yet to write a single line of code for the new project, it seems that the company is interested in helping big businesses use WhatsApp to conduct customer service - and perhaps even transactions - with consumers. In short, WhatsApp will be launching accounts specifically for businesses. The bottom line here is exactly that - the bottom line of Facebook. With user growth plateauing in its most profitable core markets, ad revenue is going to follow very soon. Once its top line starts getting hit, the company is going to want to supplement it one way or another ... and that's where acquisitions like WhatsApp play a major role. In the online space, companies pay to advertise to new audiences - not the same ones over and over again (although there is a lucrative "remarketing" segment that thrives on this). For example, if you were an advertiser selling a cosmetic product, you'd have a filter on your Facebook ads that allowed you to target people who either buy cosmetics or were in a demographic that typically does. You may have a potential reach of 1 million users, for example, but what happens after you run through that million and get all the sales conversions you can from that group? If you don't have the option of acquiring a new audience, you're going to be looking for a different advertising channel - and WhatsApp could become that channel for Facebook advertisers that are constantly hungry for new audiences to reach out to. And this is exactly why the future of Facebook is dependent on the number of new user platforms it can offer to its customers - which are other businesses. More about this in my recent article called Facebook Has A Problem. Remember, Facebook is NOT a B2C (business to consumer) company no matter which way you look at it. It is essentially a B2B (business to business) operation that offers businesses the opportunity to reach out to potential customers. Consumers don't pay Facebook to stay in business, and that's one of the problems with the free platform model - user count can get as high as FB's, but that's not where the money is coming from; consumers are merely the conduit through which revenue is generated. It's the same with any social media app that is free for the user. The moment WhatsApp pulled out its user fee, it became "just another free app". Admittedly, that free app has over a billion users, but the money still has to come from other businesses via ad revenues, licensing or user fees. The scenarios I have laid out above are the likely roads Facebook will take, simply because it has little else to choose from. I'm curious to see what route it'll take with WhatsApp, but one thing is amply clear: The company cannot allow it to be left un-monetized indefinitely. Facebook needs a growth driver to supplement its ad revenues, and WhatsApp with its billion users is the logical choice. The management team at FB has already proven that it can monetize a social media application where the majority of the competition has tried and failed. It has the expertise for sure, and now it's time to roll up its sleeves and make sure that Facebook's lofty valuation has the additional support it sorely needs.
