Apple: Key Takeaways From Monday's Event - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha New 4-inch phone quite powerful and at a lower price point. Company targeting two markets - the key to driving unit sales. New iPad looks to steal PC sales, may limit Mac ceiling. On Monday, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) held its highly anticipated event. The new 4-inch iPhone contained many higher end features but yet came at a price point lower than expected. On the iPad front, the company launched a new Pro model in an effort to attract consumers away from the PC. While much of the day's event came as expected, there are still some key takeaways for investors. With regard to the new 4-inch iPhone , Apple found a way to target both sales growth and consumer upgrades. The phone's internals were significantly upgraded as compared to the previous smaller phone, including support for Apple Pay. At the same time, the lower than expected $399 price point will help Apple in growth markets like India, where the company's larger, more expensive phones got off to a sluggish start. Obviously, stronger sales of a cheaper phone will negatively impact Apple's iPhone average selling prices ("ASPs"). However, with this phone only expected to represent about 10%-15% of iPhone units sold over the next year, the impact won't be too large. Additionally, those in markets like the US looking to upgrade will probably go with the 64GB or more storage models, which go for $499 and higher. At these price points, the SE probably won't have as high margins as Apple's more premium phones, but I don't think the company would have priced this phone at a point where overall margins would have taken a sizable hit. One of the most interesting items that came from the event can be seen in the image below. Apple detailed that there are over 600 million PCs in use currently that are over five-years-old. The company is obviously trying to invigorate struggling iPad sales, which may end up limiting the success of the Mac. Apple now has a lineup of 4 iPads, with the mini starting at $269. On the higher end, the company is looking to challenge rivals with a newly announced 256GB storage Pro model. With Apple expected to sell around 50 million iPads this year, getting even 5% of those older PC holders to buy an iPad could significantly increase the tablet's sales. As I've detailed in the past, Apple needs a strong secondary product to go alongside the iPhone. That's why I believe an iPad upgrade program is eventually necessary. The company also cut the starting price of Apple Watch to $299, which leads many to believe a second edition is coming soon. I'm hoping that as we get into the second edition, Apple will start to break out Watch results in the quarterly numbers. Apple shares declined a little after Monday's event, although they had run up a little in recent weeks. It's not uncommon for the "buy the rumor, sell the news" phenomenon to occur, so I wouldn't be alarmed by trading prices over the next day or two. Apple delivered what it needed to on Monday, an upgraded smaller phone at a lower price point. The company also beefed up its tablet lineup as a way to get older PC holders to convert. While lower average selling prices may negatively impact margins a little, Apple is realizing that to increase total revenues - you have to sell more units. That was the key to Monday's event, and I believe it was successful. In the long run, that should be good for the stock.
