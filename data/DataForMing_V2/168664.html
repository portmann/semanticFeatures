Yahoo Still Has A Lot Of Options After The IRS Feedback - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha The IRS does not appear in favor of YHOO's 384 million share spinoff of its BABA stake. That's ok, because the majority of YHOO's valuation is still tied to BABA. It then has its core business, cash, and a stake in Yahoo Japan that we exceed the valuation of YHOO's market cap minus BABA. One of the big reasons that Yahoo's (NASDAQ: YHOO ) stock has fallen 37% this year is fear that the IRS would deny its proposed tax-free spin-off of the 384 million shares of Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) that it owns. Therefore, when the news came Tuesday afternoon that the IRS would indeed reject the spinoff, it came as a surprise to many investors that Yahoo's stock actually traded higher by 2% on a day when markets tumbled. What this signaled was two things: First, clarity is the best policy on Wall Street, and second, Yahoo's stock is just too darn cheap, and this news was baked into the stock price. Specifically, it doesn't matter whether Yahoo can spinoff Alibaba tax-free, or whether Yahoo has to spinoff its core business or Yahoo! Japan for that matter, the bottom line is that the value of Yahoo's components greatly outweigh its valuation. Nothing changes the fact that Yahoo owns 384 million shares of Alibaba, a stake that is currently worth $24.5 billion. Furthermore, Yahoo still owns a 35% stake in Yahoo! Japan, which was recently valued at $8.8 billion. Yahoo also has $7 billion in cash, and lastly, its core business is worth something too. With over $5 billion of revenue expected this year, let's value Yahoo's core business at $7.5 billion for the sake of argument. That's 1.5 times expected sales, and far cheaper than the three to five times sales that other medium and large sized technology companies trade at. If you add it all together, Yahoo would be worth $47.8 billion. Yet, Yahoo's market capitalization is only $29 billion, which means the company's valuation would have to increase about 65% just to reach fair value. Also, something to keep in mind is that Alibaba's stock has declined nearly 40% this year amid a rapid decline in Chinese equities. If it were to reverse, Yahoo's worth would increase significantly. With that said, so many investors are worried that Yahoo will get stuck paying the taxes on its Alibaba stake, 39%, which would devalue the asset. Clearly, that's what the IRS wants, but what investors must realize is that such an action by Yahoo is very unlikely. Since Yahoo still has so many valuable components of its company, it also has options. Yahoo has the option to spinoff its core business into its own entity. Or, it could spinoff its Yahoo Japan stake. Another option is selling those Alibaba shares back to Alibaba at a discount, or selling part of the shares in the open market, or to large Alibaba shareholder Softbank. In fact, Yahoo may even be able to sell its Yahoo Japan stake to Softbank, who also owns stock in the company, or to another suitor. The bottom line is that the IRS's decision is not the end of the road by any means. Yahoo still has a lot of options, and valuable components. It's those valuable components that still make Yahoo a good investment opportunity. In essence, Yahoo is not only an investment in its undervalued components, but also an investment in a beaten down Alibaba stock. That makes Yahoo very attractive. Disclosure: I am/we are long YHOO.
