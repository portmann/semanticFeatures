Apple: Making Sense Of Q2 Guidance - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Q1 revenue guidance: Somewhere in Cupertino, someone is saying "Nailed it." For those of us who follow Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), the wait between earnings releases is consumed with Monday morning quarterbacking and endless discussion of the last results and the direction the stock and company are headed. A few weeks ago, Apple released their much anticipated fiscal Q1 results to the delight of some and panic of others. They announced fully-diluted earnings of $3.28 per share. While this came in under well short of my projected number based on Apple's history of guidance (see Learn From History: Pay Attention To Apple's Crystal Ball ), a lot can still be learned from the newly-supplied data as we continue to predict what Apple's crystal ball is telling us. But, first, I need to address a couple of comments from astute readers of that article. In a comment section initiated by reader "peto1," the share count used in my calculations confused some readers. Apple does not help us in any of their reports in this matter, giving three different share counts. In the header information of the 10-Q or 10-K, the number of shares outstanding are given as of a certain date. This date is usually a couple of weeks after the actual quarter close and is closer to the actual earnings announcement. Sites such as finviz.com use this share count when listing the outstanding shares. In the latest 10-Q, Apple lists 5,584,583,000 shares outstanding as of January 8th. The balance sheet shows another share count, which is the actual outstanding at the end of the quarter. This number is 5,584,487,000 as of 12/26/15. And finally, we have the number of shares used to calculate the earnings per share, which is the weighted average number of shares during the period. For fiscal Q1, this number is 5,594,187,000. The weighted average number is the basis for my calculations, as it is the number used by Apple in determining its EPS numbers. A second reader, "ijshearer," found an error in the number presented as actual revenue over high-end guidance. Correcting this percentage (5.3% to 8.65%) results in a change in my Q1 prediction from $3.52 to 3.53 after adjusting the corresponding surprise factor down to 3.75%. As always, I appreciate the oversight of the SA community. Apple had guided revenue to be between $75.5 and $77.5 billion. I had projected revenue to be between $78.52 and $79.502 billion. Actual revenue reported for fiscal Q1 was $75.872 billion, very close to their low guidance. Yes, somewhere in Cupertino, someone is saying "nailed it!" In fact it was the closest it has been to that low guidance since low-end revenue estimates were reinstated in their guidance in Q2 of 2013, a mere 0.5% over the guided number. The effect on my findings used to project Apple's future earning is that this dropped the average of the actual revenue over low guidance down nearly 3/4 of a percent, from 8.65% to 7.97%. Yes, that's right, the actual revenue over the last twelve quarters has averaged almost 8.0% OVER their low guidance. For reference, my refined guidance numbers for revenue as reported in November were as follows: For revenue - low end of range - Add 4.0% to the low range of guidance For revenue - high end of range - Add 5.3% (now corrected to 8.65%) to the low range of guidance The 4% was based on the lowest deviation up to this latest report. This latest report doesn't change my opinion on Apple's ability to correctly guide us. As mentioned above, the high end was adjusted and now falls down to just under 8.0% over guidance. This leaves us with the following to apply to the current guidance: For revenue - low end of range - Add 4.00% over low revenue guidance The guidance for Q1 provided in Apple's earnings announcement on 10/27/15 was for the gross margin to fall between 39% and 40%. Actual GM fell in a fraction over the high end of this range at 40.09%. This continues the trend seen in the previous few quarters with the actual numbers getting close to falling within the range of guidance. The average of the gross margin high guidance over actual declined slightly from 0.475% to 0.443%. On the low end, the actual gross margin % came in at 2.8% over the November low guidance, dropping our average actual slightly to just over 3.86%. For our projections, I had tempered these guidance numbers with a "safe" number, which matched the lowest actual percentage over low guidance over the last 10 quarters. This number, 2.4% over low guidance, continues to look like a good bet. Our findings stay the same: Apple's guidance for Q1 for operating expenses were a range from $6.3 to $6.4 billion. For the seventh time in the last twelve quarters, the actual number, $6.252 billion, came in below the low end of the range of guidance. Actual results for operating expenses had averaged just 0.30% over the low-end guidance. Adding in this quarter's results drops that number even closer, averaging just 0.21% over this Low end range guidance. It is interesting to note that Apple has not once exceeded the high end of guidance since reverting back to giving a high and low range for their guidance back in 2013, twelve quarters ago. This past quarter the actual operating expenses bounced back to the higher side at 2.31% less than the high range of guidance. The twelve quarter average is now 1.77% less than the high end of guidance. For computing our refined guidance, middle ground between the high and low guidance averages puts it at 0.78% off high guidance. For operating expenses - Subtract 0.78% from high guidance. In next quarter's report I will expound on the relationships of operating expenses to revenue and other factors as a means to further refine our interpretation of Apple's guidance. Net other income derived from interest, dividends, interest expense and other expenses for Q1 was $402 million. This number was almost dead on to the guidance number of $400 million. In fact, it was the closest actual to guidance percentage in the last 29 quarters. If only we could count on this near perfection. For the most part, however, the actual to guidance has been anything but perfect, swinging wildly from a -129% to +145% variance. On average the actual is 4.28% less than the guidance for the last twelve quarters, down slightly from an average of -4.71% in the previous quarter. I suggest following along with this average and applying a number 4.28% less than the guidance for this parameter. Apple's Q1 tax rate came in at nearly a percentage point under their guidance at 25.28%. Their guidance of 26.2% was slightly lower than their previous quarter guidance where the actual also came in under their guidance, In the last 12 quarters, seven came in under the guidance but there have been no extreme moves to suggest that the tax department at Apple doesn't have their act together. As in last quarter's findings, I would take this guidance at face value. This brings us to the easily manipulated share count. With Apple's computing prowess, it's hard to believe they do not have the ability to predetermine mid-quarter where the current numbers are heading. Additional instruction to accelerate announced buybacks can have quite an effect on the closing bell of the quarter. This past quarter was no exception with the share counts used for computation of earnings per share dropping 3.56%. A drop that rivaled the Q1 2015 drop of 4.1% and Q1 2014 drop of 3.35%. If share counts had remained the same as the previous quarter, Apple's earnings would have only been $3.17 per share. For the 12 quarter number we have been utilizing on the other parameters, Share count used in calculating EPS has dropped an average of 1.44% over the period. However, Q2 has not always been a robust drop. In fact, the last three Q2 numbers have averaged just a 1.14% drop in shares. For our purposes of determining the truth in Apple's projections, I would run with the Q2 average. As noted in the opening paragraphs of this article, the surprise factor was corrected to be 3.75%. Adding in our correlation to the Q1 results, drops our surprise factor to 3.66%. Using the guidance supplied by management (revenue - $50-53B, gross margin 39-39.5%, expenses of $6-6.1B, other income of $325M, tax rate of 25.5% and share count equal to last quarter), EPS for Q2 will fall in a range of $1.83 to $2.03 per share. Calculating earnings per share for Q2 based on these findings puts Apple's Q2 earnings between $2.02 and $2.13 per share. Adding in the "surprise factor" puts the range between $2.10 and $2.21 per share. Taking the average of this range puts my Q2 projection at $2.15 per share. This is $.02 less than the highest current estimate shown on Yahoo and $0.17 over the current Zack's estimate. We'll all find out on April 25th. *Image (Apple Store Sydney) Source: Apple.com Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.
