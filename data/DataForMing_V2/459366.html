Nvidia: Wells downgrades to Underperform due to renewed competition from AMD and Intel - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) | Seeking Alpha "We think that renewed competition from AMD (NASDAQ: AMD ) in graphics and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) in coprocessors could create headwinds to growth and possibly limit Nvidia’s (NASDAQ: NVDA ) ability to beat expectations in the near term." "We expect Nvidia will be able to continue to grow its coprocessor business in the future but we wonder if rising competition from Intel in this segment creates some headwind to momentum in the space. We think the Knights Landing family might help Intel regain some share in the HPC coprocessor market, though Nvidia has also introduced a new coprocessor family this year, its Tesla P100."
