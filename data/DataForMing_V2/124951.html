Synaptics: A Buy On This Fear-Driven Pullback - Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA) | Seeking Alpha Synaptics has recently fallen off the pace because of a highly-speculative report. This pullback only makes the companyâ€™s rock-solid fundamentals and valuation more appealing. Year to date Synaptics (NASDAQ: SYNA ) is up more than 20%, but more recently the company's stock has fallen back from the $100 level because of reports that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is developing integrated touch controller/display driver (TDDI) ICs, potentially threatening the lead Synaptics is believed to have in this young market. For me this fear-driven pullback offers an attractive entry point for long-term investors. Fundamentally Synaptics is a strong company, with a TTM operating profit margin of 10.13% that marginally trails the software industry average and a TTM return on equity of 16.02% that is slightly better than the industry average of 12.80%. On an asset utilization basis, Synaptics generates $0.73 more in revenue for every dollar in assets than the overall industry. Looking to the company's balance sheet its $243 million in debt is more than covered by the company's $380 million in cash and cash equivalents alone. The company's current ratio of 2.21 also indicates a fair level of balance sheet stability. Standing as a leader in the fleeting smartphone and tablet industries, Synaptics has generated tremendous growth on both the top and bottom lines in the past. This trend of solid growth is something that analysts are looking for the company to keep up, with EPS expected to total $6.34 for 2016, more than double the company's current TTM figure of $2.91. Achieving such a high caliber of growth should not be a huge problem given the immense growth that is expected in Synaptics' industry going forward. In total internal estimates project a 39% compound annual growth in the company's target markets until 2018. Meanwhile, 88% annual growth is expected in the TDDI market according to estimates by DisplaySearch. Such immense upside is why Synaptics' stock has come back so much just on rumors that Apple was looking to compete in this market. Even if Apple was developing such a solution, Oppenheimer's Andrew Uerkwitz believes "Apple's TDDI is unlikely to come to fruition until 2018." In another of the company's potential growth markets, the biometrics market, IDC Gartner estimates a 40% CAGR from 2015 to 2018. With disregard to Apple, Synaptics has leading market positions in its key markets of operation and already has solid relationships with a variety of prominent brands worldwide, including most importantly Samsung. The $270.4 million Synaptics has spent on research & development over the trailing twelve months should allow the company to remain a market leader with superior offerings and take full advantage of the explosive growth expected in its key markets. On nearly every comparative basis, Synaptics trades at a discount to its overall industry even despite its solid fundamentals and exciting growth potential. The only way I believe Synaptics will be awarded a more premium valuation is through the company delivering financially. The market has real concerns about Apple infringing on the company's market share and other companies offering more competitive products leading to margin compression. Still by the end of next year I see shares trading from $97.20 (2015 EPS estimate * 20 P/E ratio) to $145.80 (2015 EPS estimate * 30 P/E). Overall I believe this pullback represents a buying opportunity as it was based on a highly speculative report. Still remaining is a company that is fundamentally strong and has all the pieces in place to capitalize on the explosive growth expected in its key markets.
