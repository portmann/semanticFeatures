Intel Needs To Split Into Two - Cramer's Lightning Round (6/22/16) | Seeking Alpha United Technologies is trading above the bidding price it received from Honeywell, and this makes it a buy. The market hates the footwear business currently. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE: ABT ): CEO Miles White is one of the best in the pharmaceutical business. Cramer likes Abbott Laboratories. United Technologies (NYSE: UTX ): Cramer says the stock is a buy, as the company is trading above the bidding price it received from Honeywell (NYSE: HON ). Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ): Intel either needs to get lot of business from Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) or find a new customer and split itself into two. Sturm, Ruger & Company (NYSE: RGR ): Although Cramer had liked this company previously, he thinks Smith & Wesson (NASDAQ: SWHC ) is a better pick, since the latter had a good quarter. Kinder Morgan (NYSE: KMI ): Cramer believes Kinder Morgan is more levered to oil and gas than he had expected versus being a toll road operator. He prefers Enterprise Product Partners (NYSE: EPD ), but is not aggressive about buying it. Nevsun Resources (NYSEMKT: NSU ): It's a cheap stock, but the mining business is still risky to be in.
