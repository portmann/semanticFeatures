Wells Fargo cuts estimates for strike-hit Verizon - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha May 20 2016, 15:00 ET | About: Verizon Communications (VZ) | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) says it's well set up to handle its wireline customers, amid a strike by nearly 40,000 workers that's now in its sixth week -- but Wells Fargo sees struggles ahead, lowering estimates on the telecom. The firm is cutting its forecast for wireline revenues by $343M in Q2, and by a whopping $826M for 2016, along with lowering margin estimates on the wireline operations. Strikers are almost all wireline workers, and the wireless workers aren't unionized, but "the strike has become a distraction to its wireless operations," says analyst Jennifer Fritzsche. "VZ has been less promotional with its wireless offerings in Q2, and recent checks have shown some unfavorable (customer-switching) trends." The two sides are talking again, with federal help, but “management recently indicated that install and order activity for FiOS has ‘significantly dropped’ as employees have been primarily focused on repair and maintenance." I think the 4.5% drop is anecdotal because the stock has been dropping since Early March. I think VZ will be fine. I don't own any VZ. I hope all those strikers lose their jobs look what they're doing to the company that they work for ,the only people benefiting are the unions hopefully now Verizon has to have cutbacks and start laying off these lazy losers I wonder what the spread is between income not paying the workers expenses and the extra cost of replacements and overtime expense. I also wonder how much the workers are losing between loss salary, they do in some states get unemployment plus funds from the union strike fund ETF Screener: Search and filter by asset class, strategy, theme, performance, yield, and much more ETF Performance: View ETF performance across key asset classes and investing themes
