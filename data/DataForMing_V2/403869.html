Amazon Vs. eBay - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha We look at Amazon versus eBay point by point. I love pairs trades. I love them even more when they are backed by fundamental factors and not for the mere sake of hedging market risk. And I love them super even more when they're done with options. As we move into 2016, we have seen big-name tech stocks with clearly innovated products and reasonable valuation, such as Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), hurt by earnings, while stocks with no real products and nosebleed valuations, such as Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), fly on earnings. In light of this, I want to direct your attention to two stocks in the same sector and considered by many to be running the same business: Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY ). I am often asked by my students why I recommend trades on AMZN, but not the other big online superstore, eBay. The short of it is that AMZN is more volatile and trades at a higher price than EBAY. But what about investing? Are both stocks equally worth your capital? Notice that in the most recent earnings reports of both companies, both beat on earnings, the stocks rising in response. While I often run fancy codes on fundamental ratios and the like for the analysis of an individual stock, I prefer to open Zero to One, Peter Thiel's book, when comparing companies. In this article, I will apply the Zero to One reasoning in determining which one of AMZN or EBAY you should hold, if any, and whether a pairs trade makes sense. While Mr. Thiel's book is mainly aimed at analyzing startups, I often find that I can bring the philosophies forward in analyzing a pair of companies. Let's do this point by point. eBay: Now that eBay has split from PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL ), I believe the answer is "no." eBay is an online auction site not much different from any other online auction site, including Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) auctions or Alibaba's (NYSE: BABA ) Taobao. Other than a tall barrier to entry, no company is prevented from creating an auction site that mimics and possibly engages in incremental improvements upon eBay. Amazon: With cloud technology now quite common and competitors such as Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) closing in on Amazon's AWS market share , it is hard to say that Amazon is still innovating in the cloud. Amazon's tech overlaps with that of too many companies, from the Fire TV Stick versus Apple TV and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) versus Amazon Prime. However, Amazon does have Mechanical Turk, which is a streamlined outsourcing technology platform that seems irreplaceable at the moment. However, this service seems to be dying on its own - not that it contributed much to revenue anyhow: Is now the right time to invest in either of these companies? Looking at Google Trends, we get an idea of the trends in these companies' respective popularity, which makes for a good starting point. We see a pivotal point in late 2014, when Amazon overtook eBay in popularity: But more interesting is the actual shape of Amazon's chart. Clearly, we have a seasonal trend which peaks in the holiday season. My seasonal investigations into Amazon show this to have a significant impact on the stock . In this respect, EBAY makes for a better "buy and hold" than AMZN, which is a better seasonal trade. Still, other aspects of timing must be considered. For example, because of Amazon having multiple revenue sources, one of which being cloud services, we must ask ourselves whether these industries are growing. With cloud, the answer is "yes," supporting a bullish long-term thesis for AMZN, the current leader in cloud. But also, if you believe a market crash is overdue and could happen this year, you might consider what will happen to AMZN and EBAY during this period. While it is easy to compare prices on the two sites and conclude that one might be cheaper than the other, a more rigorous investigation is warranted. By observing how both stocks acted during the last market crash, we should get a better idea as to which is the safer hold: Here, AMZN was the clear winner, rebounding rather quickly. Although the maximum drawdown for both stocks was similar, AMZN recovered prior to the end of the market crash period, implying that investors had faith that the company would do well in spite of a recession. EBAY was not so lucky. Does either company have a monopoly? In a way, both Amazon and eBay have monopolies. However, both companies have changed significantly since their inception. As an early adaptor of eBay, back in high school, I remember that all sales were performed by way of auction. Now, this is not so. My purchases on eBay today are all "buy now" purchases. I believe both bidders and sellers have caught onto the psychological phenomenon of bidding going higher than the market price in an auction. With the introduction of sites such as Amazon, non-unique items are often cheaper on the one-price-fits-all sites. Likewise, Amazon's hold on distinguishing retail customers is slipping as a result of many specialty online retailers. Many online retailers are strengthening their online marketing and social media game plans to build communities around their online stores. Much as how a fashionista wouldn't settle for buying her clothing at Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ), niche retailers such as Birchbox, Fab.com, and Zulily (NASDAQ: ZU ) have reeled in customers from the more generic Amazon. In addition to this change, Amazon sees much of its revenue coming from cloud services, which is also a slipping monopoly. Spread out on too many fronts, the company will inevitably lose at least one of its monopoly wars. Still, at present, it is the king of online retail in the Western world. Answer: The auction monopoly that eBay holds is becoming a smaller monopoly; the monopolies that Amazon holds are slipping away as a result of competition. Auction lovers will likely still be using eBay ten years down the line. Even if we see niche auction sites pop up, they will probably not steal many of eBay's customers. In addition, the status that it attaches to seller accounts will keep many sellers using the platform because of the sunken cost bias , and as long as eBay has a wealth of sellers, buyers will continue to come looking for deals. eBay is a people business and much more of a community than Amazon. In addition, it comes with fewer rules and regulations than Amazon. This allows for the sale of more unique items and good deals on brand new items, which brings in a consistent audience. Amazon also has staying power, for reasons already stated (monopolies and market leadership). The company also managed to make it unscathed during the dot com boom, despite a -10 P/E at the time. People believe in Amazon because of its trustworthiness, in addition to its name recognition. In other words, Amazon has the people's trust - everyone, including my grandmother. eBay is a bit of a different story, as many still steer clear of it because of the rare threats of scams and because of a mistrust of PayPal. Many people, including myself, have had bad experiences with eBay, and some of those people refuse to get back on the horse - especially now that we have a car (in the form of Amazon). Amazon has the buyer's trust AND his credit card, which lowers the threshold for sales and increases the customer base willing to do business through the platform. As long as the company can keep that trust, its retail business will remain safe. The same goes for Amazon Web Services, but of course, that trust must be at a business-to-business level. Overall, I don't see much negative in either company. Clearly, we did pass an important pivot point in late 2014, at which point Amazon would have been the better buy for investors who must choose between AMZN and EBAY. Amazon continues to gain momentum, while eBay falls in popularity and in EPS. That said, a logical pairs trade on these two stocks would be to long AMZN and short EBAY. The short side of the trade is not necessarily a speculative trade against eBay as a company (though it can be, as revenue and earnings are falling). The short leg could just be seen as both an industry hedge and a market hedge. Honestly, I would feel safer in 2016 were I long AMZN and short EBAY, as opposed to being just long on AMZN.
