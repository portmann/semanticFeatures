Why Disney Is Going To $133 Or Higher - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha DIS reported another great quarter but the real buzz is on Q1. Star Wars has proven to be an enormous source of revenue despite the fact that it hasn't launched yet and will continue to be. Disney's cord cutting fears were overblown and now that investors are focusing on the business again, Disney is set for its next move higher. Disney (NYSE: DIS ) has been one of or perhaps my most vocal long position in 2015. I love the company's diversified focus on entertainment and the ecosystem makes Disney more valuable combined than it would be broken up. We saw the stock take a beating along with the rest of the market back in August when I said the sell-off was a gift but since that time, DIS has made a beeline higher and is now within a few dollars of its all-time highs. With Q4 earnings out and providing some optimism among investors, Disney's future certainly looks very bright again after a bleak Q3 report. Q3's report was mired in talk about how ESPN and Disney's TV business in general were becoming an impaired asset due to cord cutting. But Disney's ecosystem of content and its live sports broadcasting business insulate it from cord cutting. I also presented research in my linked article from Sanford Bernstein that said Disney is more insulated from losses even if cord cutting does occur on a massive scale. But as I also said, I think fears of this are way overblown and that investors were reacting with their hearts and not their heads. I realize cord cutting is a popular thing to talk about but subscriber numbers suggest that it is still by far the minority instead of becoming a growing movement. Cord cutting has been the giant overhang on Disney and the rest of the cable stocks since Disney reported Q3 earnings but that was a case of panic for nothing. Iger commented on ESPN's future and said the company is very bullish and why not? Disney is the premier live entertainment ecosystem anywhere in the world. That makes it extremely valuable and that isn't going to change as people aren't simply going to stop watching sports. Now that the overhang has been removed, what about catalysts to move higher? I think ESPN could be a source of moderate strength in fiscal 2016 as it right sizes off of layoffs and gets its business model under control. As people begin to see that the sky isn't falling we should see some easing of downward pressure from naysayers on Disney's TV business. But the real catalyst here for a higher move is Star Wars. Pre-sales of tickets are off the charts and everyone has seen Star Wars everything at retailers around the country. Star Wars is similar to Disney's other properties where merchandising in an enormous piece of the revenue puzzle. Disney produces content and gets its cut there but also opens the door for merchandising. Q1 should see the brunt of Star Wars related revenue and I expect it will be huge. The nice thing about merchandise revenue is that while there is an initial swell, merchandise continues to be purchased for several quarters for big properties like Star Wars. Frozen was a great example of this as merchandise for Frozen has certainly declined in popularity but only after several very strong quarters. I expect Star Wars will do the same and that is irrespective of Disney's other properties as well; it isn't as though Star Wars is the only property Disney has right now. Disney is now trading for just 20.6 times this year's earnings estimates and 18.8 times next year's estimates. But analysts have barely budged their EPS estimates for this year despite the fact that Star Wars has seen more demand before it has even launched than even the most bullish forecasts. I think analysts are missing the boat here and that Disney will end up with a blowout Q1 followed by a terrific remainder of 2016. Remember that Disney still has many more big properties yet to launch so the party doesn't begin and end with Star Wars by any means. The epic rally from $97 to $116 in a straight line has been great but I think Disney is showing some signs of short term top. The stock's momentum indicators are showing that the stock's buying pressure is waning despite the fact that it is near its recent highs. That would signal that Disney will either chop around this level or move down a bit to alleviate some of the pressure. I would welcome this as below - around the $108 area - is a tremendous amount of support. The 50DMA and 200DMA are both rising rapidly and are converging on each other in that area and that means that if Disney were to pull back there, it would likely see lots of buying pressure. I really hope we get that chance because it would be a tremendous opportunity to add at a low risk spot. Overall I couldn't be more excited about Disney's future. The nonsense surrounding the cord cutting issue has faded as investors have begun using their brains again. The Studio business couldn't be stronger as all indications are that Star Wars will be a runaway success and many other properties are set to launch in the relatively near future. Disney's other businesses continue to be strong but that is nothing new as the ecosystem is robust and profitable. At 18.8 times next year's earnings I think there is certainly room for multiple expansion this year and that by the end of fiscal 2016, we could see Disney trading for 21 to 22 times fiscal 2017's EPS target which now sits at $6.20. That would imply a price of $133 at the midpoint and that is my target for Disney. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
