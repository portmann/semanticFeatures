Tim Cook, We Need More Share Buybacks - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Despite Apple's $200B capital return program announcement, total shareholder returns fell in fiscal 2015. An unwillingness to use accelerated repurchase agreements might show Apple is losing faith in the value in buying back its stock. Despite this, I still feel the stock is moderately undervalued. Apple's current authorization will soon expire at the current pace. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has long been a core investment for many retail investors enamored with the stellar growth the company has had and continues to have. The ride has been wild, and Apple's strong shareholder return policy is one that is often lauded by analysts and investors alike. In April of 2015 , Apple announced it was expanding its capital return program to a mind-boggling total of $200B, with the share repurchase component increasing to $140B from $90B. Carl Icahn, long a proponent of increased shareholder returns at Apple, likely leaned back in his swanky office chair that day and cracked a big smile, imagining the flood of capital to support his Apple position. Easy money. But now that we are months down the line from that pronouncement, how are the capital returns, especially the share repurchases, progressing? Are shareholders really benefiting to the degree that many expected at the time of implementation? The results may be surprising to some. Before I critique Apple on this point, I will come out and say I'm long Apple and have been for some time. I've held it for many years, buying additional shares when the market was overly irrational on its future prospects. I've never sold a single share, and don't intend to, barring a fundamental unraveling of its business model. That seems incredibly unlikely at this point. With that said, when you dig into Apple's most recent annual 10-K disclosures (highlighted above) you'll find that from a raw numbers perspective, 2015 doesn't seem to have turned out to be as big a year for shareholder returns as many investors may have expected. This weakness goes straight against the media bravado around the shareholder return announcement. Total shareholder returns (dividends, share repurchases, equity award settlements) fell to $49B in 2015 from $57B in 2014. So despite just $36B remaining on the current buyback authorization, overall shareholder returns have actually fallen year/year by 14%. Most interestingly to me, accelerated share repurchases fell meaningfully by $15B from $21B to $6B. This is an incredible change in buyback direction, with Apple instead choosing to rely on open market purchases instead of accelerated plans. For those unaware, accelerated share repurchases are deals done directly with investment banks that allow Apple to buy substantial blocks of shares in amounts that would otherwise be difficult to complete immediately in the open market. During one of these agreements, Apple pays an upfront premium to an investment bank and receives a large block of shares it can retire immediately. From the investment bank's perspective, a little maneuvering must be done in order to get those shares to sell to Apple. Often, the firm will temporarily borrow the shares Apple wants internally from clients or through stock loan agreements with other banks. In essence, the bank is effectively short the stock. However, we all know these sly investment bankers aren't going to take on unnecessary risk by being short. So as part of the share repurchase agreement, Apple bears pricing risk on the investment bank's open market purchases to cover this short. If the average share price increases over the course of the investment bank's purchases, Apple is on the hook for the difference. Likewise, the opposite is true. If the share price goes down, the investment bank returns the difference to Apple. Accelerated share repurchase agreements, in my opinion, signal more management confidence in share undervaluation. As we now know, once you commit to an accelerated share repurchase agreement with an investment bank, you're on the hook for any price increases as the bank covers its short. Open market purchases allow you to make purchases when you feel shares are undervalued and stop when you feel they aren't. This factor makes open market purchases the go-to transaction choice when management thinks shares are nearing fair value. This is supported by empirical evidence and how the market tends to react to these agreements, such as this research that shows the market reacts more favorably to accelerated repurchase agreements rather than open market purchases . The key takeaway here is that Tim Cook and team may not feel that buying back Apple stock at current prices is as great a deal as it once was. I'm not all doom and gloom here. I will gladly point out that repurchase activity increased during the fourth quarter to $14B. This means nearly 50% of the fiscal year's share repurchases fell in the fiscal fourth quarter. There are two sides to this. If you're in the camp that thinks Apple is using primarily open market purchases because it feels shares are near relative fair value, the data is supportive as the average price per share was the lowest it has been since the April repurchase authorization bump. Historically though for Apple (which I admit is thin), Q4 has always been the biggest quarter for repurchases. For example, 33% of fiscal 2014 purchases fell in Q4 despite that quarter having the highest average cost per share for that year. You can speculate the case either way, or we could simply be over-analyzing Apple's buying trends. For now, I still feel Apple is undervalued but this trend away from accelerated share repurchases is something I'm greatly interested in. Investors should remember that only $36B remained on the authorization at the end of fiscal 2015. While other research pieces on Seeking Alpha, such as Neil Cybart's recent piece , highlight the recent acceleration in buybacks that we have seen that took place in Q4 2015, this pace is simply unsustainable under the current program. At Q4 2015's pace, the buyback authorization would be nearly gone before Q2 2016. It's clear that with six quarters left to go until the expiration of the current authorization (March 2017), Apple will quickly exhaust the current program. This would represent a meaningful contraction in shareholder returns. Spreading the remaining $36B over six quarters would represent further contraction in total funds committed by Apple to buybacks. Fiscal 2016 total shareholder returns would fall below 2015 levels, creating a multi-year downtrend. Investor confidence would be shaken and shareholders would lose a key piece of Apple share pricing support. In short, Apple needs another $100B, two-year authorization put into place sooner rather than later, which is easily supported by current and projected future cash flows. While many expect 2016 to be poor for Apple, I don't feel that way. I see 5% revenue growth likely, with a hair of margin contraction primarily due to continued USD strength compared to key currencies (CNY, EUR, JPY). The company is going to throw off an incredible amount of operational cash flow, likely to be in the $85B range in fiscal 2016. Assuming $12B in capex, the company is all set to generate $73B in free cash flow. That easily supports a return to 2014 levels of shareholder returns ($57B) with plenty of billions left to spare for Apple's treasury team to play with. *Carl Icahn, right before he says "Apple, buy back more shares!" With that time of free cash flow generation imminent, don't expect Apple's favorite buyback cheerleader to remain quiet for long. Icahn trumpeted loudly for a larger authorization immediately after the raise in April, but he has been suspiciously quiet lately. From looking at 2015 results, it looks like his initial bluster was right. The shareholder return plan implemented was simply not enough to sustain total shareholder return growth over 2014 levels all the way through to its expiration. Shareholders should expect him to break out his Twitter account again shortly, detailing another one of his calls with Tim Cook about wanting further share repurchases and harping on Apple's cheap valuation. While this article could be construed as negative, it isn't meant to be. It just simply points to an Apple management team that seems to lack the confidence it had in its own value back in 2014. They shouldn't feel that way. Fiscal 2016 will be better than fiscal 2015. Earnings will continue to grow. The bottom line is that Apple should at the minimum expand its current buyback authorization soon, at least back to up to $150B with a March 2019 expiration. This gives the company the ability to return to growing total shareholder returns, all of which is easily covered by free cash flow. C'mon Tim Cook. Carl Icahn and I are waiting.
