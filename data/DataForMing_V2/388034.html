Bloomberg: Yahoo narrowing more than 10 offers from $4B-$8B - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha Apr 22 2016, 19:14 ET | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Yahoo ( YHOO -0.5%) and advisers are set to spend the weekend narrowing down more than 10 first-round bids for its core business, ranging from $4B-$8B, Bloomberg reports -- with an eye to moving forward as soon as next week. The higher-end bids reportedly came from bidders who haven't spent as much time with Yahoo, which should lead to more scrutiny into the structure of the offers. In addition to the known bidders (that hadn't denied reports) -- Verizon ( VZ +1%), YP Holdings, TGP, and Bain/Vista Equity Partners -- one or two other strategic firms were involved. Echoing earlier reports, SoftBank ( OTCPK:SFTBY +3.4%) isn't in the bidding but is likely eager to talk with anyone who also wants the Yahoo Japan stake. My understanding is it is a simple asset sale, so none of the drama of a 'possibly' tax free reorg that they planned previously. Core assets are worth much less than the BABA stake (not to mention the tax basis of the core is probably much higher = less tax due). Presumably that's why Starboard wanted it this way. "A final decision is likely at least a month away" - What kind of crazy nonsense is going on there that can possibly take a over a month? I hear you David,my mantra is "don't delay what you can do today",bids might get pulled if Mayer keeps d--king around! David: if you were a potential bidder, wouldn't you want as much info as you could glean...the "core" is not exactly firing on all cylinders and I  believe any buyer will have to do a lot of work to be positioned to receive a reasonable return on their investment. I would think this would take a couple of months. Notify best bids in a couple of weeks. Give them 2-3 weeks to sharpen their pencils. Review bids in 2-3 weeks. Maybe have BAFO and give a few bidders another week. Review and announce. This assumes everyone works their tails off. if a bidder buys core at 6-8B, and also BABA, and YHOOJ as one huge bundle, what would the STP be translated into a range of SP?  (say 50-60?).  This is imo the best scenario. the more likely scenarios is looking like something different...what if the bidder only buys core and leaves BABA and YHOOJ behind?  what would the SP be?  45?  and do you sell all your shares at say 45, or do keep some as you invariably may benefit your remaining position turning into possible shares or cash if BABA and Softbank buy back their respective remaining shares? At 6-8B, we are only talking about core i think, no?...buying the whole enchilada requires much more (I was hoping BABA come in to buy the whole thing!).
