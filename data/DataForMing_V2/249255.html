Disney Investors Should Be Concerned - Not Panicked - About ESPN - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Disney's sports network ESPN has been shedding subscribers for the past two years, declining from 99 million in 2013 to 92 million today. This loss of subscribers puts ESPN back at 2006 levels and represents a substantial loss of revenue, even for a giant like Disney. While Disney still remains a safe investment, especially with the Good Dinosaur and Star Wars coming, but investors should be concerned about how ESPN might harm the bottom line moving forward. Make no bones about it - Disney's (NYSE: DIS ) sports network ESPN is in trouble. Disney filed regulatory paperwork right before Thanksgiving , potentially to soften the blow of some bad news regarding ESPN. ESPN's subscriber base has declined again year-over-year, from a high of 99 million in 2013 to 92 million in 2015. Is ESPN a bubble about to burst? Photo credit: FOX Sports Should investors panic over this news? Quite simply, no. ESPN and Disney are not in material trouble in any sense. However, the decline in subscribers is indicative of growing trends among millennials that should prove detrimental to Disney (and cable companies overall) if they continue. ESPN contributes about 25% to Disney's bottom line according to Nomura Securities, so a closer look at the network's issues is warranted. As previously mentioned, ESPN has suffered a substantial decline in its subscriber base. This has a ripple effect on much of what Disney does in running the sports network. To see this, let's refer to some startling numbers from Fortune writer Matthew Ingram: Analysts like SNL Kagan believe that ESPN gets about $6.60 for every core ESPN subscriber, and anywhere from 22 to 83 cents for each subscriber to its other networks, such as ESPN 2 and the SEC Network. The loss of 7 million or so subscribers since 2013 means that ESPN is now getting $650 million less in affiliate revenues, Jackson says -the majority of which is pure profit. The company is also estimated to be making about $250 million less in advertising because of its shrinking reach. In other words, ESPN is generating close to $1 billion less than it did two years ago. SEC Network has helped defray that somewhat, but not by a huge amount. And the sports network is crucial to Disney's bottom line-the media networks unit had operating income of $7.3 billion last year, the bulk of which was generated by ESPN, and that unit accounted for more than 55% of Disney's operating income last year. Furthermore, Wells Fargo's Marci Ryvicker says this subscriber loss has already cost $700M in FY 2015 cable affiliate fee revenue and $200M in 2015 cable EBITDA. The costs now are relatively minor for a firm that is valued by the market at nearly $190 billion. But if these trends continue negative, it's not only problematic for Disney but indicative of wider issues with cable overall. This can be seen from a rather hyperbole-saturated conservative article from Breitbart. While this is an opinion piece which uses its hyperbole to convince its readers to unsubscribe from ESPN due to perceived "liberal bias," it does have one quote of interest for our discussion. From a macro perspective, this massive dip in subscribers is a problem for all of cable television. These 7 million losses are cord-cutters; people who canceled their overall cable package. ESPN is singled out for a couple of reasons: 1) ESPN has sold itself to cable providers as the top reason people want cable TV. 2) ESPN makes a ton of money off cable TV. Thus, ESPN's problems may be indicative of wider movements afoot in the ways people watch and purchase television content. For all the talk of "cable-cutting" over the last few years, cable companies have still done very well in the stock market; but that may change if what's happening to ESPN starts happening to the cable industry overall. But let's not rush to conclusions here. ESPN's stumble needs to be kept in proper perspective. Disney still remains a veritable fountain of cash. The upcoming Star Wars movie is all but guaranteed to be a huge haul for the company, with estimates saying the movie could bring in a record-breaking $200 million in the opening weekend. It's worth mentioning that no movie has ever even brought in $100 million in the debut period, so this number is particularly astonishing. Furthermore, Disney has incredibly rich value in the multitude of IPs it owns. The House of Mouse can pretty much turn anything into gold with its touch due to its vast holdings and production value with movies and related merchandise, not to mention the theme parks. The only trouble for Disney looking forward is whether the company can continue to beat heightened analyst forecasts, or trouble could come in the form of a broader market meltdown. So while Disney is in no major financial trouble due to ESPN, the ESPN network could prove particularly costly if trends continue negative. ESPN is reliant upon the cable model, which may or may not endure in the face of the cable-cutting trend (or "fad," depending on how you look at it). Nothing drastic should be done before we can confirm that cable is indeed facing a monumental challenge. But, there are some solutions in the meantime that Disney could implement to bring back some of the lost subscribers. The first potential solution is rather charged, and is slightly based on the aforementioned Breitbart article: stop politicizing. Whether ESPN likes it or not, and whether the conservative's claims about the network are true or not, people are turning away from ESPN. Sure, it could be for a number of reasons, but ESPN certainly doesn't need bad press from a potential customer base. These day, simply the appearance of politicizing can turn people off. It may help to limit political discussions on a sports channel so that they don't polarize an already tense climate. The second potential solution could help bring in new revenues if done right: streaming options. Some analysts have mulled the possibility of ESPN being streamed directly to the consumer, like HBO Now. Even Disney CEO Bob Iger has commented on the matter, saying: Five years out, I don't think you see significant change ... I think eventually, ESPN becomes a business that is sold directly to the consumer . Where there's an engagement that ESPN will know who their consumers are, will use that information to customize the product, enable personalization, to essentially engage in a much more effective way and also to offer advertisers more value as well. Disney is already testing such a model with DisneyLife in the UK, so could ESPN go straight to customers in the near future? We'll see. The pressure is on Iger as Disney is shelling out around $2 billion a year for NFL football games and will pay $1.4 billion to the NBA starting in 2016. If ESPN continues to lose subscribers, serious questions will persist as to whether Disney is paying too much for those deals. And, as Matthew Ingram again opines, an ESPN streaming service would need to be run very carefully as to not cannibalize its own cable offerings: There has been some talk of an ESPN over-the-top streaming service, and Disney CEO Bob Iger has said that he believes large numbers of people would pay a significant fee for such a service. But how many? And what kind of monthly fee would be involved? Those are the key factors that would determine whether ESPN could make such an offering fly. And it's entirely possible that the network could have a successful service, but still not make enough from it to compensate for the drop-off in conventional cable subscribers and affiliate revenue. The chart below is fairly self-explanatory and shows how much ESPN would have to charge to bring its service to customers un-bundled - and this is simply to maintain current levels of revenue. Whichever way you look at it, something has got to give with ESPN. Either they're going to have to renegotiate contract terms with the NFL, NBA, and MLB, or they're going to have to make hard choices and cut in other areas to remain competitive. Disney is going to need to seriously re-evaluate how it runs ESPN and what to do with a segment that drives 25% of the company's revenue. With a rich pipeline of movies and related paraphernalia coming down the pike, Disney has some time to consider its options. But one idea is clear: if things continue heading the way they are, ESPN is going to become an increasingly expensive asset to maintain.
