Amazon's Strategy To Dominate Cloud Computing With AWS - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha The role low pricing has in the long-term growth outlook for AWS. How products and services are adding value in a low-price environment. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) has been ramping up the pace of its growth strategy for Amazon Web Services (AWS), as it moves from primarily servicing small and mid-size businesses, to enterprise companies. Its existing strategy has been based upon gaining market share by slashing prices, having done so for just under 50 times since 2006. That will probably continue going forward. That has some risk associated with it because of the potential it could be considered a commodity business rather than one that adds value. Some of that appears to have been mitigated by its large number of announcements of new products or services added to its cloud business. Rather than look at the new services in this article, we'll look at the strategy Amazon is using to gain market share while positioning itself for future price boosts once its customers are locked in. With AWS possibly representing the most significant growth driver for the future with Amazon, it's important to understand the company isn't only cutting prices, but adding enormous value with the numerous new products it's adding to the service. Investors need to know how this will eventually increase not only revenue, but add significant earnings to the company's performance. It's hard to see at times because it is expected to continue to cut prices in the future. So far its strategy seems to be working on the market share side, as some like RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney believe Amazon now has approximately 50 percent of cloud computing platform sales market share. If it starts to gain with the larger companies, it's going to move above that percentage. To get an idea of whether or not AWS is not much more than a commodity service at this time, when Oracle (NYSE: ORCL ) recently said it would cut prices to 1/10 of AWS, AWS kept prices at its current level, it was still able to not only maintain share, but incrementally grow it. What that suggests to me is AWS is already gradually moving away from competing solely on price, and is considered to have value to a growing number of its customers. That said, on its latest earnings call CFO Brian Olsavsky said there would still be more pricing cuts in the future. That tells me Amazon wants to be the dominant force in the cloud segment, and it's going to do whatever it needs to ensure it is able to maintain that leadership far into the future. Amazon has faced a similar type of battle in the retail sector, as it realized it needed to compete beyond price alone. So it developed and offered its premium retail subscription service, Amazon Prime. It had incorporated, and still incorporates, a strategy of developing new products and services to enhance the business in order to differentiate from the large number of retail competitors it competes with. The test of its value to its customers was when it increased the annual price of the service from $79 to $99. By then it had shown and convinced users its service was valuable enough to keep on using even with that boost in price. I think it's going to do something similar in its cloud business, as it continues to add value by releasing an enormous number of tools and apps to use in the service. What Amazon has done so far is moved so quickly and aggressively with pricing and added products and services, it has positioned itself rather quickly into the market leader. If it continues to operate in that manner, as it has in the past, it'll be difficult to compete at that level, as other cloud companies are starting to look old, stodgy, and satisfied, rather than nimble and hungry like Amazon is. In a general way, as far as strategy goes, we're going to see a repeat of how it attacked giant retail competitors using Prime as its major tool to secure a loyal customer base willing to pay for the perceived added value of the service. To the extend Amazon can lock in cloud customers, this is probably something we'll continue see in the future, meaning eventually Amazon will have so much value in its AWS, it'll be difficult for companies to decide to leave it, even when the time comes for Amazon to boost prices. I think Oracle was a trial balloon to see where its existing and potential new customers were at in how they viewed AWS. It appears they now consider it valuable enough to not leave or try another cloud service based on price alone. It should be taken into consideration I'm talking about the long term here. I don't see AWS increasing prices in the near future. What I see it doing is continuing to cut prices and add products and services as quickly as possible. Once that value is in place, that's when it will probably reverse pricing direction. Even though AWS accounts for only a small portion of revenue and earnings at Amazon, the potential for future growth on the top and bottom lines is strong. Looking ahead to 2016, BGC Partners analyst Colin Gillis estimates AWS will generate close to $11.8 billion in revenue, with an operating profit of $2.36 billion. AWS is the biggest wild card in Amazon's valuation and the reason is that the growth rates are significantly higher than the retail growth rates and the profit margins are higher and it's a small part of their business today. If you think about what could potentially have the biggest impact on the stock over the next five years, it's most likely AWS. Amazon is in this for the long term, and with higher margin spread in this market, it's more than willing to sacrifice that for share, as it can still generate a profit while it grows the business. If is able to pull of taking the business to the next level with a lot more enterprise business, those numbers could easily surprise to the upside in 2016. A risk the company does face because it has attracted so many start-up companies, is any number of them could fail over time, which would put some downward pressure on its growth trajectory. This is why it needs to grow out the number of enterprise customers using AWS. While I don't want to gravitate toward products in services in this article, one that is important in the overall picture, which should help it with enterprise growth, is its partnership with Accenture (NYSE: ACN ) to help companies "migrate to and run their business in the AWS Cloud." Chief Strategy Officer, Accenture, Omar Abbosh, said this : Cloud is increasingly becoming a starting point with our clients for their enterprise solutions. Whether our clients need to innovate faster, create new services, or maximize value from their investments, the Accenture AWS Business Group will help them get there faster, with lower risk and with solutions optimized for AWS. What the new group will do, which includes cloud experts and professionals from both companies, will primarily target enterprise businesses in order to easy the transition to AWS, removing a major obstacle to change. One thing I like about this is both companies are committed to the long-term view, which should help AWS boost its market share in the enterprise market, resulting in a more consistent and larger revenue and earnings stream over the long term. Beyond helping companies move to AWS, further out the group will work on developing new services to offer in market segments like Security on the AWS Cloud and Internet of Things. One thing I see Amazon doing in all this as part of its product-building strategy with AWS, is to quickly develop and release so many products, while lowering prices, that it makes its competitors look like those that have commodity cloud businesses. It's not that there aren't new products being offered by its competitors, but they're at nowhere near the aggressive pace Amazon has launched them at. So when companies start to compare cloud services, there will be an increasing spread between what is offered by Amazon and what is offered by its competitors. I don't think too many investors are looking at this as part of its share strategy. I'm convinced it is. Larger companies especially will have to be given a reason to go through the headache of changing cloud services, and Amazon is quickly moving to increase the number of reasons it is well worth the effort. Adding its new focus on helping the migration, coupled with an ongoing array of new offerings, Amazon is likely to continue to grow market share incrementally. At this time I believe the surprising performance of AWS has given the company a lot of impetus with its share price. What investors should watch for is how all the announcements of new products and services play into the overall strategy Amazon is incorporating to be the dominant global player in the cloud sector, meaning, looking for the market to look at AWS as more than a commodity service. It's harder to analyze the new offerings because you never know which one may help the company differentiate and be the deciding factor in the decision to go with AWS. That's why Amazon continues to throw a lot of things out there to see what will stick. Since we know Amazon is going to continue to do this, tying that into its strategy is important in order to get a hold on its progress with AWS. Also vital is the inroads it makes with enterprise businesses. That is the real key to sustainable future growth for AWS, and how well it does there in share will determine how consistently the company performs over the long term. It's low price, added-value strategy is helping move the company toward making that a reality. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
