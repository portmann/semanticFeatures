Apple: How About An iPad Upgrade Program? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Analysts believe the iPhone upgrade program is great for Apple. The iPad has a longer replacement cycle, so more potential sales to be had. One of the biggest takeaways from this year's launch of the iPhone from Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) was the company's upgrade plan . The plan seems to be good for consumers, but even better for Apple since it lowers the replacement cycle for the phone and is estimated to increase margins. If this plan turns out to be successful for the company, it seems only logical that Apple should do this with the iPad, a product that's struggling for sales growth, as seen below: *Personal estimate. Data taken from Apple's 10-K page . While consumers don't depend as much on tablets as they do on smartphones, Apple is still expected to sell about 55 million iPads in its fiscal 2015 period, generating revenues of approximately $23 billion. Just a few years ago, the tablet represented roughly one-fifth of the company's revenues. But with iPad revenues down 24% through the first nine months of fiscal 2015, the tablet might drop below the Mac, into third place, in terms of product revenues. AAPL's upgrade program for the iPhone allows consumers to get a new phone each year if they so choose, basically a leasing program with benefits. As analysts have pointed out, there are a number of key rewards for AAPL here: It locks customers into the iPhone indefinitely. It halves the iPhone upgrade cycle (to 12 months from 24). It builds an inventory of used phones that can be refurbished and resold. It takes control of, and legitimizes, the grey market for second-hand iPhones. It seems to me almost a no-brainer that a similar program would make even more sense for the iPad. Seeking Alpha contributor Neil Cybart states that the iPad replacement cycle is currently three years, but is extending and could easily reach 5-6 years. One of the key reasons cited for the iPad's sales slowdown, and the tablet market in general, is that consumers are holding onto older models. By starting an iPad upgrade program, Apple could hopefully stop the lengthening of the iPad replacement cycle, and potentially start reducing it. That should boost sales of the device, especially since it would lock in customers for life. In my opinion, the biggest opportunity relates to the last bullet point above, gross margins. If Apple's iPhone plan is priced so that gross margins can rise by 500 basis points, it would seem logical that Apple could do the same with the iPad. We've always figured that iPad's gross margins are much lower than iPhone's. Thus, it would seem that if Apple could price the iPad plan to get 500 basis points of improvement here, the percentage increase (rate of change) would be much more significant for the iPad. A few years ago, the launch of the iPad mini caused a drop in Apple's gross margins, a fact which AAPL bears pounced on. Apple would love to eliminate every part of the bear thesis, and improving iPad margins would help a bit there. Critics of an iPad upgrade plan might contend that it would force the company to make major changes to the tablet each year. Technically, you could make the same argument with the iPhone. However, remember that these upgrade plans give you the option to upgrade. If the year's refresh isn't that great, like the shift from the mini 2 to the mini 3 that I stated was disappointing , you just wait until the next year. Apple probably benefits even more in this case because you are still paying the monthly fee, and it can sell the new iPad to someone else. One reason why I think short interest recently jumped is a worry about Apple building sustainable revenue growth. Apple has items like Music, Watch, and Apple Pay that are starting to generate revenues, but will take time to kick in. An electric car seems nice, but is years away (if it ever comes). Apple critics detail the company as a one-trick pony tied to the iPhone, and that is hard to argue against. This is why getting the iPad going again is key. Each iPad sale equals roughly 4 yearly single-plan subscribers to Apple Music (assuming iPad ASP rises to almost $500, thanks to the Pro model). It would seem to be a lot easier to generate 10 million new iPad sales through an upgrade program, and probably a lot more profitable to do so, than it would be to generate 40 million Music subs. I believe that an iPad upgrade plan could help Apple reach 100 million yearly iPad unit sales in the next five years, nearly double the line's current rate. This assumption is based on the company significantly reducing the replacement cycle timeline. I don't think this is too crazy given Apple's 71 million unit sales just a few years ago, and that was with just two models of the device. Having the iPad at a revenue level of $50 billion per year (and a more profitable product) would give me more faith in owning shares over the long term. I currently think analysts are being a bit optimistic in their price targets for Apple, because I don't see the stock soaring from here until the company overcomes the growth concerns. I'm not sold on the Apple Watch today, and I don't think the Mac has too much potential given the secular decline in the PC industry. Should Apple pave the way to having a dominant #2 product, like a $50 billion per year revenue iPad, I would personally consider buying some shares. A survey from RBC details that roughly 20% of customers plan to sign up for the iPhone upgrade program, but that number is on the rise. If Apple finds success with this plan for iPhone, why not try it on the iPad? The tablet's replacement cycle is even longer than the iPhone replacement cycle, with the iPad replacement cycle expected to increase going forward. With sales of the tablet currently in decline, Apple seems to have an opportunity in front of itself, one that might have even more potential given the fact that the tablet is a lower-margin product.
