Will Apple Switch To OLED Screens? - Universal Display Corporation (NASDAQ:OLED) | Seeking Alpha Apple is reportedly planning on switching to OLED technology for its iPhones for the 2018 7s, which would make the phone flexible and brighter. We think the rumors are more likely true than not given their widespread nature and Apple's need to catch up to Samsung's and LG's flexible/curved phone technology. TVs are starting to ramp, and we think the binary scenario outcome of the shares is unlikely to be the case given that manufacturing costs are likely to come down. We highlighted Universal Display Corporation (NASDAQ: OLED ) just a few months ago as a value play that was sold off due to customer concentration and slow adoption of the technology. Since then, the shares are up 48%, as rumors are now swirling that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) will use the technology in its iPhones and move away from LCD technology. Many believe the shares are likely to see a binary result of widespread adoption or complete failure of the technology in favor of other avenues. We do not think that will be the case, as we think manufacturing costs will come down and make OLED used more as a mass product like LCD is today. According to many sources , some of which have just materialized in the last several days , Apple is reportedly working on Banana iPhones for the market by 2018. One of the changes that would be made would be to use different display technology than the LCDs used today. Several influential websites are reporting that top Apple executives are "serious" about moving away from LCD to phones equipped with organic light-emitting diode screens, i.e., OLED. Our article three months ago noted the new deal with LG Display (NYSE: LPL ) signed earlier this year. LG ( OTC:LGEAF ) would be a key factor in Apple's move towards OLED technology. Other rumors confirm the connection, with BusinessKorea reporting that LG plans to shift one of its LCD lines in South Korea to an OLED line, with mass production aimed at starting sometime in 2017. It was also rumored that Apple has contracted with Foxconn ( OTC:FXCOF ) and Innolux to build a new plant that would manufacture OLED displays for the Apple Watch. This could actually be a prelude to them manufacturing OLED displays for the phone as well. The current iPhone 6s Plus has a 1080p LCD screen, the highest resolution among Apple's smartphones. Android devices have shifted to 2560 x 1440 LCDs on some devices. The problems is that these screens tend to be significantly dimmer and use more power than the lower-resolution Apple screen - a reason Apple likely didn't move to the technology. The advantage of OLED displays is that the light is produced by the pixels themselves rather than a backlight, removing these issues. iPhones with OLED screens would have many advantages compared to today's LCD iPhones. The color and resolution would be much more vibrant, with perfect black levels and contrasts because the black pixels are just "off". But the main advantage for Apple would appear to be the flexibility of the panels - something Apple is playing catch-up with Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) and LG, both of which have their own curved smartphones on the market already. We think the company is looking to not only catch up to its competition in this regard, but also to fix the "bendgate" disaster that affected the 6 rollout in 2014. This is apparent in a patent filed with the PTO last January that was awarded to Apple for flexible electronic devices. At the time, the market believed this to be in relation to the impending Apple Watch launch, but the patent has much farther-reaching implications. One of the design drawings in the patent looked very much like that of an iPhone. The company has been hesitant about making the switch to OLED because of the perceived life of OLED screens. But as we noted in our prior write-up, management has been quick to work out issues that the OEMs perceive in the technology. Right now, Samsung is the only company that can produce OLED panels in any large quantity, though LG will soon have a similar capability. Other recent reports suggest that the company may not be moving to OLED displays for its phones due to capacity constraints and manufacturing costs. We think people are looking at the issue as too black and white, and that we are likely to see several levels of value from Apple. We believe that Apple will likely launch two levels of iPhones - like it has done in the past - to satisfy both the high and low ends of the market (the iPhone 5c, for example). The high-end phone would likely have the OLED technology and be sold at a higher price point, whereas the low-end phone would still contain LCD technology. What does it all mean? We think the path for OLED technology will not be complete widespread adoption right off the bat. The main impediment remains manufacturing costs, which move the price point of the device outside of many mass consumer markets. Many analysts have noted that the manufacturing costs are likely to restrict widespread adoption by OEMs, especially for low-end devices. But as we suggested above, it is unlikely to be used in every handset device on the market right away. We believe the manufacturing costs are likely to plummet, just like they did for LCD technology over the last decade. While the timeline for widespread usage of OLED to reach similar levels as LCD is likely at least five years out, we believe the results are not binary, as many analysts seem to believe. While these are still rumors, as Apple is notoriously secretive about its future plans, we still believe the shares are a buy, as the devices are likely to move towards OLED tech as costs decline. This is not just a phone play, but a technology play - essentially, anything with a screen, which means virtually all of Apple's products, are likely to be possible users of the technology. The question is whether or not the industry can ramp up enough capacity as to bring down pricing and keep the supply chain sufficiently supplied. We think Apple will use several suppliers, including Samsung and LG Display, but also supporting supplier relationships with Japan Display ( OTC:JPDYY ) or Sharp ( OTCPK:SHCAY ). The past three months since our last look has provided a small preview of OLED technologies' growing promise in the marketplace. Consumer electronics makers continue to add the technology to their devices, especially higher-end formats. We are currently seeing more widespread adoption, with new product launches ramping to a monthly or even weekly basis. Panel makers like Samsung have been making more and more OLED activity announcements showing the ramp of the tech. We would note that Samsung's recent quarterly results were stronger partially due to the strength of its OLED division. We were also pleasantly surprised that Samsung expected OLED cost competitiveness sooner than most, stating it was possible this year as production ramps. Additionally, looking forward, the company expects to maintain its solid OLED earnings in the fourth quarter, and forecasted approximately one-third of its OLED panel sales will go to emerging customers in 2016. Lastly, Samsung reaffirmed its commitment to flexible OLED capital investments, and reiterated that it believes flexible OLEDs to be a major mid- to long-term growth engine. The negative in the quarter was LG's announcement that it will ship between 400K and 500K OLED TVs in 2015, below the guidance that it reiterated several times in prior quarters of 600K. But we think LG's recent announcement of impressive yield improvements with the LG 55-inch OLED TV yields that are now comparable to LCD is a major step forward for the technology. The company also expects the 65-inch and 77-inch OLED panels to reach similar yields in coming quarters. The shares are up ~46% since our write-up in late August, completely re-rating the shares on the back of the Apple rumors. So what is priced in and what isn't? The sell side has a 17% top line growth CAGR over the next four years, with revenue rising from approximately $200 million this year to $377 million in fiscal 2019. If the Apple rumors are true - and it appears at this point more likely than not - then those revenue estimates are far too low, likely by a multiple of 3-4x. The downside is if the technology peters out before 2018, when it is forecasted to be in the iPhone and other technology. That would clearly crush the shares. There is a lot of embedded risk in the shares, and the current forward P/E of 35x remains low if we were to know for certain that Apple and other OEMs moving towards OLED technology were adopting the tech. But that P/E is discounting the probability of the technology not seeing widespread adoption, possibly due to manufacturing costs not coming down like they did for LCD tech. We attempted to assign probability scenarios to each valuation path. We think the weighted average probability of the three scenarios produces a 2018 value of $81 per share. We discounted that back to today, for a current valuation of ~$61 and a one-year price of $67 for upside of 13% and 24%. The call option on widespread adoption means the shares could be worth substantially more than they are today, but you must be willing to take the risks associated with these sorts of technology plays. We disagree with most market assessments that the shares of Universal Display are a binary outcome investment similar to a biotech firm developing an unproven and unmarketed drug. We believe that the major impediment cited for the adoption of OLED technology - manufacturing costs - is likely to see strong declines over the next several years as capacity and utilization ramp up. This was a similar concern with LCD technology a decade ago, but those costs declined substantially as the number of products and manufacturers ramped up. We think the Apple rumors are likely more probable than not given the widespread nature and the need for the company to compete with Samsung and LG. But even without adoption by Apple, we think the technology will gain steam as costs come down, and that it will follow a similar path as LCD.
