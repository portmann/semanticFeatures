Ford workers approve UAW labor contract - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Nov 21 2015, 00:02 ET | About: Ford Motor Company (F) | By: Carl Surran , SA News Editor Ford (NYSE: F ) workers narrowly voted to approve their new four-year labor agreement after receiving tallies from plants in Dearborn, Mich. The Detroit Free Press reports that the Dearborn truck plant, with more than 4,300 workers, voted 74% in favor, which apparently was enough to carry all of the Local 600 union to passing the vote and in turn ensuring the entire contract was ratified. Ford is the final Detroit automaker to reach a new national agreement after GM 's deal was ratified Friday following a two-week delay. Gee.  I guess working together unions and responsible management can come to agreements without demonizing each other.  A good lesson to so many who post in union articles in SeekingAlpha who can't help but demonize unions.  Good for you Ford and UAW. Many union jobs are also shipped overseas when labor costs get to high. It takes a joint effort between labor and management to recognize what is best for the financial health of the company. I read an article last week which said the younger workers in this contract didn't think the $8.5 thousand signing bonus was enough.......? Should have upped my shares before the agreement, but I thought the Union side would have struck down the proposal.....o well maybe Ford will brake the $15.00 barrier again soon The flaws with unions are the same with any collectivism, whether it is communism, socialism, progressivenism, etc....when you are paid the same as the guy next to you regardless of whether you work twice or half as hard as he does.....productivity always suffers, tis the nature of man.  This is why everything unions touch usually end up going bankrupt at some point (Automakers, steel, teamsters, airlines, governments, etc...)  and do a lousy job servicing their customers.....Teacher unions are probably best example of this. CI'm glad this is over, it appears Jimmy Settles had to go down to Dearborn and tell the membership a no vote is a lose, lose, proposition. Word was if it didn't pass we would have re- voted on the same proposal and if that didn't work, a strike. The senior UAW leadership understands what's at stake, but didn't do a good job selling it until the 11th hour. There is nothing wrong with the work ethic or skill set of the average worker. The problem is the mentality. I wonder if Ford should drop the nepotism in their hiring practices and start vetting the employee candidates of their choice, not the unions. The apple falleth not far from the tree and I think we had some bad apples. The outcome was exactly as I predicted: modest raise, strong cash bonuses, and a road map to full pay within 2 contracts. It turned out it was even richer then that. Yet I was still surprised at the difficulty in passing it and it does not bode well for future contracts. I really like your comment about the nepotism!  it is a serious problem in many public owned companies where mngment by passes knowledgeable experience rich employees and bring in thier completely inexperienced family and friends. most uaw workers recognize very quickly they have zero chance of promotion and that they will allways be just the help whos opinions arent important or recognized. the actual problems with these companies lies at the top and middle mngment levals.those that perform the actual product assembly quickly become uninspired and demoralized I agree with ivan above. Once the UAW committee signs the agreement, the outcome is in the hands of the UAW leadership. If they fail to get ratification, it`s their problem not Fords. I`m glad to see that the UAW leadership did their job. I own a lot of Ford stock. With the Ford-UAW contract settled, I will sit back and watch the $9 billion plan in factory upgrades and expansions that will create or preserve 8,500 jobs in the U.S. unfold over the next 4 years. If management is smart they will use a large part of the $9 billion in upgrades to replace the 'never satisfied' union people with more robots. The average assembly man is screwed either way. Google "robonaut 2" Its a NASA machine that is slowly but consistently becoming as dexterous as a human. Ford and GM has already moved much of their supply chain to mexico or other cheap labor markets and whats left will be overrun by robonaut 3 or 4. This is not because of evil heartless management either; this is because technology does not stand still, and if you aren't good at the STEM fields you will be obsolete within 20 years max. If my children aren't talented at making others' laugh then i hope to god they get into engineering school. Otherwise they wont be able to afford moving out. Jobs moving to Mexico and the head democrat bringing illegals here as fast as he can to take jobs from Americans in their own country. Did union rank and file vote for that? While I'm certainly not a Union supporter, congratulations are deserved here. The UAW leadership and all their members negotiate and approved a contract, without the usual animosity that saddled past negotiations. Both sides, should be proud that they made a contract that should help and not hinder the company for the next 4 years. Well done. Congrats Ford investors, that was a close one.  Jimmy Settles did a good job on the contract for his members, the tough part was getting the young guys to realize it. Not holding my breath on a positive stock price blip for this.... If recent past is any guide.... Good F news seems to causes its stock to go DOWN! Lets hope that with these news the stock price starts going towards at least to 10 to 12 T/E ratio before the end of the year ETF Screener: Search and filter by asset class, strategy, theme, performance, yield, and much more ETF Performance: View ETF performance across key asset classes and investing themes
