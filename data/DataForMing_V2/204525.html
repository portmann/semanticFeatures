Apple: Best Tasting Bear Ever? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Stone Fox Capital , Stone Fox Capital (1,598 clicks) Apple trades down to correction territory with a loss in excess of 20%. The data points don't suggest Apple has any growth problems in China. The big shock in the market selloff is that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) had already reached bear market territory before the dramatic selloff at the open on Monday. Like other tech stocks, Apple has been hard hit by fears of a slowdown in China. The reality though suggests that the fears are overblown making the stock collapse perplexing. At the lows of the day, Apple traded down roughly 30% from the recent highs near $134.50. The question is whether the data points are wrong that suggest the fundamental story hasn't changed despite the stock action. As typical of an advancing market such as the smartphone segment, a shift can impact vendors differently. One vendor can lose share while another gains from a move to more advanced technologies. As Mark Hibben adeptly highlighted , Gartner provided research of Apple taking market share while the segment declined. The numbers highlight that consumers aren't updating the low-end smartphones unless it involves shifting to the iPhone 6. With China Mobile (NYSE: CHL ) aggressively building out a 4G network, the Chinese market is going to increasingly shift toward phones most capable of utilizing high-speed data. While the companies relying on supplying the 3G market will struggle, those focused primarily on the 4G will see their prospects improve. As TechCrunch highlights , the Chinese market is saturated with low-end phones for first-time buyers. Consumers are either content with those phones or looking for premium phones such as the iPhone. While Apple is the second largest smartphone vendor in units sold, the current issue is clearly an Android problem when it comes to the units sold by operating system. All of the phones by Xiaomi, Huawei, and Lenovo ( OTCPK:LNVGY ) and others that flooded the market are mostly indistinguishable low-end phones on Android. The aspirational consumer still wants to reach up and buy the Apple products with upgrades to 4G. The iOS operating system only had 14.6% market share during Q2 providing plenty of upside despite potential overall market weakness. Even Apple CEO Tim Cook reached out to Jim Cramer on CNBC today to suggest these exact data points above are playing out. The investment community commonly refers to the market cap when referring to the valuation of a stock. In the case of Apple, the stock has now entered a bear market due to the collapse in the stock from a high of $134 to trading as low as $92.00 in early trading Monday. At a current price of around $105, the drop is equivalent to an approximately $170 billion drop in market value to the current value of only $600 billion. The part that makes Apple extremely tasty is that the enterprise value has suffered a significantly larger percentage decline. The prime reason being that the net cash balance on the balance sheet doesn't lose value. Another great example that a company with a strong balance sheet and a large stock buyback make good investments. Apple peaked out with an enterprise value of $624 billion (market cap of $776 billion less net cash of $152 billion). The stock now has an enterprise value of $450 billion for an even larger 28% collapse. With $26 in cash per share, Apple is now technically worth an enterprise value of $79 and trades for only 8.7x forecasted earnings for 2015. The stock is an even cheaper 8.1x forecasted 2016 earnings. Of course, the biggest concern is that the positive EPS trend changes (see Apple: The Key Trend Remains Intact ). The weakening Chinese economy and the weakness in the U.S. will impact consumer demand to a point, but the above data suggests Apple will have a smaller problem than the stock price reactions recently would suggest. In fact, analysts have actually slightly increased the EPS estimates since the prior article. Apple won't overcome a global recession or even a Chinese slowdown, but the premium positioning and small smartphone market share shields the company from major downside risk. Along with the large cash position that is incorporated into market cap, Apple is a very tasty bear. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
