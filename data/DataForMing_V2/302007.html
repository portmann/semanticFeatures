The Rally Continues, But Apple May Slow The Momentum - Bezek's Daily Briefing | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I am/we are short FCG. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. The markets were up strongly again on Tuesday. Tuesday was a very important day for the US equity markets. On the surface, it might look like it was merely a reversal of Monday's sizable sell-off. But the important story of the day is that the US finally shook off the terrible Chinese news. China dove 6.3%, hitting new 52-week lows. This despite China holding their currency flat for the day. It's seeming that China's efforts to hold up their markets are really starting to lose traction. If the yuan ends up devaluing to 7, as more and more people are expecting, it's hard to see that Chinese stocks wouldn't end up going far lower. Japan also got hit hard, following the Chinese lower. And pressure continues to mount on Hong Kong to break their three-decade long peg to the US dollar. Long story short, there was plenty to worry about in Asia. By early Tuesday morning, market futures were deep in the red again, down almost another percent on top of Monday's losses. Oil (NYSEARCA: USO ) was also falling, as was the pattern, where oil, the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA: SPY ), and Chinese equities all trade in lockstep. And then, something snapped. Oil turned it around, with WTI crude going from $29.50 to as high as $32.30, a 10% in 12 hours move. The European markets reversed and closed much more firmly. And US shares roared off the lows, with the S&P 500 futures contract roaring from 1850 all the way up to 1900. All this happened despite Chinese shares closing at new 52-week lows. At any time over the past month, with China down 6%, you'd expect oil to get routed and commodity stocks to collapse. Instead, the sort of stocks that had been getting killed with China declines led the way higher on Tuesday. The basic materials ETF (NYSEARCA: IYM ) was up 2% on the day. Mining stocks also bounced sharply, with copper (NYSEARCA: JJC ) retaking the pivotal $2 level. The Briefing has been supportive of the idea that the bottom is in, and that the markets will bounce since Thursday. Now that the US can laugh off Chinese stock market plunges, the case for more upside has grown stronger. We have to see what course the Fed decides upon, but the bull case is looking better with every passing day. It's no easy task for a CEO that follows in the footsteps of a legend. So far, Tim Cook has received no respite from that curse. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has been run for the past few years in just the sort of managerial risk-averse make-no-mistakes sort of way that is endemic to large monolithic companies. Apple's new product launches, post Jobs, have been very drab. When a watch is the most exciting new product to drop in years, you know the innovation cycle has really slowed. On Tuesday, the company put in a decent quarter, but it was just that. For many years, Apple has consistently blown out earnings. This time, they just barely beat, and sales of Macs, iPads, and iPhones were all short of expectations. The iPad, at a 25% drop in sales, was a particularly low point. To add insult to injury, the next quarter was projected well below expectations, with revenue down as much as double digits from the same quarter last year. As it would turn out, it seems all that pressure on Apple suppliers' stocks was justified. Apple, like Gilead (NASDAQ: GILD ), is a classic example of a "cheap" company that can get cheaper as the main product line has stopped growing. Sure, the company may be at a 10 P/E, well into the single digits once you adjust for cash. But there's no business momentum. The iPod went from company savior to an asterisk. The iPad is in a huge decline. Other services and products are marginal to the bottom line. This company now lives and dies on each iPhone release. If you get a good launch, you can maintain steady revenues. If you miss the mark, the company's overall revenues and profits will plunge. Apple needs a bridge from the iPhone - as it fades - to the next thing. Everyone likes to talk cars or TVs or something, but until it's more clear what the future will be for Apple, it's hard to get excited about the stock. A single-digit P/E isn't necessarily cheap if your core business is shrinking. As far as the broader market goes, Apple is less important than it used to be. The Nasdaq (NASDAQ: QQQ ) no longer swings violently with every tick in the company's shares. The FANG stocks have replaced Apple to a significant degree in setting the market tone. Still, it's the world's biggest public company, and it has an inordinate weight in driving the indices. Assuming AAPL stock goes sideways or worse for a while, it will act as a drag for the broader market, particularly if Apple's suppliers also suffer. Last Friday, in the old "hide the bad news before the weekend" maneuver, Moody's put 175 oil, gas, and mining companies on watch for a rating downgrade . Not missing the party, S&P downgraded Chesapeake (NYSE: CHK ) from B to CCC+, and is on watch for more downgrades. The shares plunged on Monday. Just in December, S&P cut Chesapeake from BB- to B. This is a credit in free fall. One of my key indicators for covering my short natural gas producers (NYSEARCA: FCG ) trade has been waiting for Chesapeake to declare bankruptcy. I thought this would take a while, since the company, while appearing to be insolvent in the longer run, still has a sizable amount of liquidity. However, the current market reaction in debt, equity, and CDS shows that Chesapeake may fail faster than even bears such as myself had guessed. Major bellwether bankruptcies often mark bottoms for distressed sectors. Speaking of distressed, Petrobras (NYSE: PBR ) got a piece of bad news on Friday. Citigroup research found that Brazil would need to potentially backstop Petrobras with $21 billion to fix that company's capital structure. At least at this point, Brazil - the sovereign - could step up for that amount of funds, but it would force Brazil into much more austerity measures. With GDP shrinking around 4% already, more spending cuts would be a tough medicine. Finally, of note, some of the better majors are even coming under fire. There's been heavy selling on ConocoPhillips' (NYSE: COP ) equity and debt recently. It's been out of line with the rest of the majors, making one wonder what's specific to Conoco. The company's long-term relatively high-yielding bond is still trading around par, but it had previously carried a huge premium. While the company is far from distressed, its risk profile is rapidly heading in the wrong direction. Barclays was also out with a call that it's around coin flip odds whether the COP dividend gets cut.
