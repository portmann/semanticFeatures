iPhone 7 Launch Date: Move It Forward To Address Competition - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple has become a value and/or speculative investment play. Moving back the launch of iPhone 7 invites market share erosion. Moving forward the launch of iPhone 7 can possibly negate competitive threats to some degree. Samsung is having a busy spring with the launch of Samsung Galaxy 7 and 7 Edge. Certainly Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has fallen on hard times. As a hardware company that seems a redundancy of stature and characterization, but nonetheless the results speak volumes with regards to Apple. Having said that, since shares fell below $90, if for ever such a brief moment, the stock has performed decently, having climbed roughly 10% since then. I'm not willing to invest in shares of Apple given the company's outlook for the remainder of 2016 and the fact that the company is expecting its earnings and revenues to fall for the year. When coupled with the fact that the smartphone market is somewhat saturated or nearing saturation in many regions, Apple will continue to fight an uphill battle to generate revenue growth from the all-important product line. The iPhone is the best selling product Apple offers and by a wide margin. It has built the bulk of its ecosystem around that product over the last several years. The Apple reputation for quality products will remain sound even as iPhone sales slide, but within that context I would need to see the company find a bottom for the product line before dedicating capital to shares of AAPL. Frankly speaking, I don't think that bottom will be found in 2016 and 2017 becomes increasingly questionable with the understanding of the potential for the iPhone 7 sales. My biggest concerns for iPhone 7 sales are the widely reported design redundancies from predecessor iPhones. In other words the design refresh is lacking and may not prove to lure customers to upgrade to the newer version. It's quite possible that the iPhone 7 does not drive incremental iPhone shipment growth in late 2016 and/or early 2017. With that being said, Seeking Alpha author Bill Maurer has posed a rather insightful question in his article titled " Should Apple Delay iPhone 7 Launch? " I'm going to get right to my opinion as it relates to whether or not Apple should delay the launch of the iPhone 7 by stating emphatically that Apple should not delay the launch. Competition is ever increasing. Here are my reasons for offering the stated opinion below: Samsung is burning up the airwaves and media outlets with its most recent launch of the Samsung 7 and Samsung 7 Edge smartphone devices. And Apple has largely gone silent or "dark" as it is referred to in the consumer goods marketing business. With a lack of substantial redesign and a September launch, the back-to-school (BTS) shopping season will likely lead to Samsung regaining market share from Apple. I suggest this as the company is launching several products at the same time, including the Gear VR headset and Gear S2 Classic smartwatch with improved functions and stand-alone connectivity. Millennials prefer the large smartphone screen to the tablet, so no help with the tablet market for Apple sales there, further supporting the need to launch iPhone7 or lose out with sales of both tablets and smartphones to Samsung and others. There is no guarantee that pushing out the launch date for the iPhone 7 will serve to benefit fiscal 2017 results more meaningfully and as that delayed launch will likely push out the next iPhone launch date. It's a bit of the cat chasing its tail and experienced investors will likely draw the same conclusion Suppliers and supply lines can become strained due to shifting product launch dates. An ecosystem functions at optimal capacity when operated on schedule. Investors will likely understand the nature of the decision to delay a product launch by Apple and reflect that understanding in the share price multiple and without consideration to Apple's reasons for doing so. Want to witness your multiple contract? Fiddle around with your product launch dates to massage your numbers. But then again, when has AAPL ever exhibited a true growth multiple or one that would be provided to those with a similar balance sheet? As such, moving the launch date out a couple of weeks would likely be a moot action by Apple. What is apparent when you look at the bullet points or rationale against delaying the launch of the iPhone 7 is what would be addressed if Apple took the opposite action. If Apple were to move the launch forward and more inline with the back-to-school shopping season, the company could effectively address most of the competition related issues facing the company. Apple has typically launched its "FYEnd" iPhone in September, but move that forward to late July and you have a massive millennial audience to address sooner rather than later and as competition would encroach on this addressable demographic. Simply put, Apple should not render itself out of sight, out of mind. There is very little room for error when it comes to branding and product positioning once markets have largely been saturated. Bring forth your best option for the consumer and let the chips fall where they may. As far as addressing international competition from the likes of Samsung, well Apple really needs to get that ball rolling. Samsung has already launched its C5 and C7 smartphone models in China that are ominously similar to reported iPhone 7 specs. What will set the C5 and C7 apart from the competition and most notably Apple's iPhone is the retail price. The C5 will retail for $366 compared to the iPhone 6 with similar storage at $649. The C7 will run Chinese consumers $427 compared to $849 for an iPhone with similar storage capacity. Apple really can't get down to these price points and it has already found itself hindered for this reason in China. Based on Apple's reported results in China, it seems as though the company was able to get its products placed at retail in China, but the sell-through did not support even equivalent orders. If I were manning the helm at Apple, I would find the current set of obstacles daunting to say the least. Additionally, I would be looking to speed up product launches in favor of delaying them. As BlackBerry (NASDAQ: BBRY ) found out years ago, delaying product launches is generally a bad idea. Your brand becomes stale and somewhat forgotten. Originally referred to as the BlackBerry London in 2011, the later known BlackBerry 10 didn't really launch until 2013 and in two models. Between 2011 and 2012, Samsung, HTC, Nokia and Apple all launched new and innovative touch screen, smartphone technologies with dozens of new apps and functions. Apple can't afford to take the same path that has witnessed the slow death of lesser brands like BlackBerry. The reality is that the iPhone 7 couldn't get here quickly enough as the door is presently wide open for Samsung and other market participants to grab market share with their newly positioned products. In recognition of that analysis and widely accepted understanding, Samsung is attempting to do just that with their most recent product promotion . Not to be caught out by the very tempting buy-one-get-one-free offers currently being run over at AT&T (NYSE: T ) and T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS ), Sprint (NYSE: S ) and Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) has also started offering similar promotions on new Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge purchases. As Apple has effectively exhibited a lull in its product launch cycle the competitive threats have heightened. Based on all the risks associated with delaying the iPhone 7 launch offered by Bill Maurer, I would think Apple could more greatly mitigate competitive threats by moving the launch date forward. As I'm presently looking to upgrade my current iPhone 6 to a new smartphone iteration, I have to admit the Samsung promotion is hard to pass up. At the same time, I've enjoyed my Apple iPhone experience and I'm willing to wait a bit longer to see what the iPhone 7 has in store before making a final decision. Until greater understanding is presented for the iPhone 7 and its sales come into focus investing in AAPL shares is not for me as I find it to be a more speculative stock in nature and with respect to the historic multiple assigned to hardware-centric companies. Having said that I certainly hope long-term investors benefit more from owning shares in the late half of 2016 than in the early half of 2016.
