Amazon Is Now Bigger Than Exxon Mobil | Zero Hedge by BullionStar - Aug 1, 2016 7:00 AM The Austrian Mint has just published its annual report for 2015. The Mint sold 41 tonnes of gold coins and bars, with its flagship Vienna Philharmonic gold coin having a bumper sales year. by globalintelhub - Jul 31, 2016 12:39 PM With Exxon Mobil sliding after earnings, Amazon's market cap - for the first time ever - is now larger than the oil giant. AMZN 2016 Est Revenue $136bn, Net Income $5.3bn Soon, a website that does nothing apart from mining all your personal data and serving as an advertising platform, will be more valuable than Exxon.

Well, smart n savvy economist Robert Solow said we can get along without natural resources, so let's give it a go. Amazon does dominate in online purchases - it simply does them better than anyone else, and their logistics are good.  They have a very liberal return policy even as brick and mortar stores tighten theirs (are you listening other retailers!).  And rather than only sell their own products, Amazon has seamlessly integrated products from small or niche companies.  Walmart, Target, Sears, etc seem like they want to cripple their own web sites so they don't hurt store sales. All that said, it's hard to see Amazon making much money, as it plows multiple millions in Bezos' oddball schemes - most of which will die off with big losses.
