Wal-Mart's 3-Day Free Shipping Trial Service May Not Be A Big Threat To Amazon Prime - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) | Seeking Alpha Ecommerce and online order delivery systems are high priorities for the retail giant. Wal-Mart is trialing a free 3-day shipping service called ShippingPass. Wal-Mart's new chairman Greg Penner has a background in tech and finance, so he will get behind further ecommerce and data analytics. Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) has made e-commerce and online order delivery two high priorities to invigorate sales and better follow consumer trends. Building many new supercenters and expanding the physical footprint of its 3,400-large box store network in the US is expensive and will take revenues from existing stores, straining the bottom line. More customers are wanting to have smaller local stores for convenient shopping rather than having to make longer trips to suburban area supercenters. Instead, Wal-Mart plans to leverage the assets it already has. The coverage the supercenter and other smaller format stores have over the domestic market makes it convenient for shoppers to order online and pick up goods at their local store. Wal-Mart's extensive logistics and shipping system that supports the stores can also be used for home delivery. Customers can already get free home delivery for online orders over $50 shipped within 4-6 days. However, Wal-Mart is having to compete more with Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Prime delivery service. Prime is pushing the envelope by offering free delivery within two days from Amazon's over 55 fulfillment centers located nationwide for an annual $99 membership fee. That prompted the company to trial a pilot free delivery service for an annual $50. The service called ShippingPass promises unlimited free delivery within 3 days for select items, and is initially only available in certain urban zip codes. Wal-Mart investors will want to see that the new delivery service drives repeat sales, but not at the expense of losing money from shipping. Amazon has found that its Prime members purchase more than double what a non-member does. Still, Amazon doesn't really make money from its delivery service. It's more like a grab for market share. If Wal-Mart tries to match or beat Amazon Prime, there may not be much to show for it other than bigger sales volumes. Wal-Mart is hoping that its regular shoppers won't be bothered by waiting up to an extra day to receive deliveries compared to Prime's two-day wait. A survey just out this week asked Wal-Mart shoppers if they would sign up to use ShippingPass, and only 12.4% of the 6,000 respondents said they would be "likely" or "very likely" to do so. Proportionately, that would be equivalent to 18 million Wal-Mart shoppers. That doesn't sound like a great up-take of the service, but the survey company Prosper Insights noted among the shoppers who were "likely" or "very likely", almost half of them were Millennials. The younger convenience-seeking generation would like that extra alternative in getting items shipped. It would have been interesting to hear how frequently each segment ordered online, and also if they regularly picked online orders up at a local Wal-Mart store. The survey company also noted that shoppers among this group were 50% more likely to have Amazon Prime membership already. Prime members total around 38 million. Online ordering is still comparatively small for the retail giant. In its Q1 2016 release, e-commerce sales contributed 0.2% of the 1.1% of comparable sales growth for US stores. Yet fiscal 2015 online sales only made up about $12 billion, or roughly 2% of total annual sales. The investment that Wal-Mart makes in e-commerce will set the stage for future growth, but until the benefits are fully realized, it's a cost.

I think the stock story improves by it, so I would have to give management some time to prove its strategy is working. Worldwide online sales rose 17% in Q1. Wal-Mart's new chairman should give the retailer's e-commerce growth strategy substantial support. Director Greg Penner's election to the chairman role was announced at the Wal-Mart annual shareholders meeting on June 5. He has been the chairman of the technology and eCommerce committee since it started in 2011, and from his previous experience in venture capital, as well as working at Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS ) he combines skills in technological development, finance and international business. His mission should be to show investors that along with ecommerce, Wal-Mart will improve service and customer satisfaction through apps and social media. Equally important is to use data analytics to understand the shopper as much as possible. Previously, Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon said , "Mobile is increasingly the driver of our ecommerce business. Sam's recently launched new services that have promise for improved member acquisition and retention, and investments in Club Pick-up and e-commerce are starting to pay off." The important theme here is to leverage what Wal-Mart already has in place to maximize earnings as overall comparable sales are weak and impacted by currency headwinds. The stock has sold down heavily from its January high of around $90, but a lower entry price could open up if earnings continue to be soft in the meantime. I'm not bullish on the company turning this current situation around quickly, so I would hold off on buying Wal-Mart.
