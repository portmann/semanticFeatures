Apple Sentiment Not What You Would Think - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Short interest continues to decline, at lowest point since late 2014. If the situation is so bad, why are investors not shorting? If you listen to some of the pundits out there, you would think technology giant Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is going out of business soon. Despite the fact that the company reported its highest revenue quarter ever just last month, fears over iPhone sales have sent the stock back into the $90s. While it appears that investors are extremely bearish regarding Apple, the latest data might prove otherwise. In this case, I'm talking about short interest. During the first roughly two weeks of February, short interest in Apple declined by nearly 6.3 million shares. In fact, since the spike we saw last November, we've seen short interest decline at five straight updates. As you can see in the chart below, this puts short interest at its lowest level since December 2014. (Source: Nasdaq Apple short interest page) If things around the company were so bad, you would expect short interest to be rising, and perhaps quite sharply. At the moment, only about 57 million shares are short, which is a little over 1% of the outstanding share count. I've tracked short interest in Apple for almost four years now, and if we adjust for the stock split a few years ago, this is only the third update I've seen where less than 60 million shares were short. So what's going on with Apple here? Well, I think we got a realistic reset of expectations with the most recent earnings report. While iPhone sales might show a year-over-year decline for a quarter or two, investors seem to think these are just temporary headwinds. Between the launch of a new 4-inch iPhone expected next month and a big refresh with the iPhone 7 later this year, investors hope that the iPhone will soon return to growth. A temporary pause in the US dollar's rally also should provide some relief to reported results. It appears that investors don't want to bet against Apple near its 52-week low, and that does make some sense. First, the decline in shares has pushed the dividend yield a bit over 2.00% annually, with a raise expected in April. Additionally, the recent debt sale makes it very likely Apple will be active with its buyback. And at lower prices, the buyback is more influential. Finally, the stock trades at just 10.5 times this year's expected earnings, a multiple well below street average. It's likely that short sellers are more interested in high valuation names whose bubbles could burst. The last two times short interest was this low in Apple, shares did quite well over the next quarter or two. In the chart below, I've used an arrow to show where the stock was at that December 2014 update, which nearly marked a short-term bottom in shares. The previous occurrence was during late Spring and Summer of 2012, where Apple shares rallied more than 20%. While it appears that there is this big cloud over Apple, investors seem to be thinking quite the opposite. Short interest is at its lowest point in 14 months and just the third time in the last 93 updates where split-adjusted short interest was under 60 million shares. With Apple trading in the mid $90s currently, it appears the majority of investors don't believe the stock is going much lower. Some are probably unwilling to bet against Apple with such a low valuation, a reset of expectations, an inflated dividend yield, and a massive buyback. Recent history suggests the drop in short interest is good news, and perhaps some iPhone launches throughout the year will send the stock higher once again.
