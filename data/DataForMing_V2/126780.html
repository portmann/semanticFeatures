Apple: Short-Term Estimates And Stock Fluctuations Mean Nothing For The Long Term - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Appleâ€™s recent price action after Q3 earnings is just a distraction and a short-term hiccup. Investors should remain focused on the long-term growth, which will drive the price over months and years, not hours or days. Apple may remain a low multiple tech stock, but I reiterate my stance that the stock will outperform the S&P 500. Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) investors have been confused and frustrated over the downward stock price movement following the Q3 earnings report. The fall in the stock price after the earnings report was attributed to the disconnect between some analyst estimates and the company's light guidance for Q4. These are all just distractions. What really matters for investors and the stock price are the actual increases in revenue and earnings over the long-term. Estimates are educated guesses and whether it is analysts who make them or the company itself, missing these estimates typically do lead to short-term losses in the stock price. However, the long-term performance of the stock price will ultimately track year-over-year growth in revenue, earnings and cash flow. It looked like all-out panic when the stock dipped 7% in after hours when the Q3 earnings report was released. However, the actual price only fell 4.3% the next trading day. So, things are not as bad as they initially appeared. Although Apple beat its revenue and earnings consensus estimates for Q3, the stock fell after the earnings report as a result of the following: 2. Estimates of 49 to 50 million iPhone sales from Piper Jaffrey's Gene Munster for Q3 were not attained as Apple sold 47.5 million units . 3. Apple's revenue outlook for Q4 of $49 billion to $51 billion which was on the low end of FactSet Research's estimate of $50.9 billion . All of this news is putting downward pressure on the stock. However, I don't think that the downward selling is the start of a new long-term downtrend. What really matters for Apple and the stock is that the company achieves above-average year-over-year growth in revenue and earnings. If the company achieves this going forward as it has in the past, the stock will continue to increase at an above average pace. Ultimately, these estimates won't mean much for the stock's long-term growth. New stories tend to highlight the negative aspects surrounding Apple and investors tend to dwell on the negative. Although this causes short-term selling, the stock tends to climb higher and make new highs over longer periods of time. For example, adjusted for the stock split, Apple's stock had a run from $79 to $119 before falling $106 on a correction. Negative news like bendgate (iPhone 6 Plus casing bending) and hairgate (users getting their hair caught in the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus) was circulating in the news just before the stock took a dive. However, the stock recovered in 2015 as it reached a new split adjusted high of $133. It could be that some large traders are just trading the stock between periods of oversold and overbought conditions. The $132 - $133 price range has been a barrier for the stock in 2015. However, I think that as time goes on, new dividends will be declared, buybacks will continue, revenue and earnings will continue to increase, and analysts' estimates are more conservative, and that the stock will make new highs. Ultimately, increased earnings will lead to stock growth. Apple just seems to be trading in a sideways range this year just as the broader market is doing. Apple has proven to increase overall iPhone sales with each new model, and the recent quarterly report shows that many Android users are switching to Apple. So missing lofty analyst expectations is not as important as achieving above average year-over-year increases in revenue and earnings for long-term stock growth. Despite any negative news regarding estimates, the stock is likely to move higher as the current noise surrounding earnings subsides. The stock is now trading with a PEG under one at 0.97. This is a bargain valuation for a high-growth stock as the company's long-term expected EPS growth exceeds its PE. Apple may remain a low multiple stock, meaning that its PE will remain below average compared to the S&P 500. Currently, Apple's forward PE is 12.8, or 27.7% below the S&P 500's forward PE of 17.7 . I think that Apple's multiple is likely to remain below the market's multiple. However, I think that the gap will be closer to a difference of 20% based on the average for the past few years. This will put the stock price at $137 based on an approximate forward PE of 14. This target can easily be reached later this year even if the market continues its sideways action. So, ignore the daily noise and don't read too much into the estimates. Source: Apple: Short-Term Estimates And Stock Fluctuations Mean Nothing For The Long Term Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL.
