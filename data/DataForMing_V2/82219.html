Apple Music under antitrust scrutiny - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Jun 10 2015, 03:23 ET | About: Apple Inc. (AAPL) | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor The attorneys general of New York and Connecticut are now investigating whether the deals struck by Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) for its new music service violated antitrust rules. The joint investigation will probe whether Apple pressured music labels - or whether the labels conspired with Apple and one another - to withdraw support for popular "freemium" services like Spotify in favor of its new paid streaming music service. Eric Schneiderman and Connecticut's George Jepsen were also among a group of attorneys generals who in 2013 sued Apple for conspiring to raise the prices of e-books. Apple agreed to pay $450M as part of that settlement. We have heard of this before when iTunes was launched. 'The joint investigation' literally means Spotify, Pandora, Deezer, Napster, Tidal et al gang up before tsunami of their cancellations and sign ups on Apple Music. Next 'joint investigation' will happen when Apple launches their exclusive vod services. You don't get big & rich without stepping on toes in the process.
