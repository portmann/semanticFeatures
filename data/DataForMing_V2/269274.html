ARM's New Initiative Will Benefit Intel Instead Of Challenging It - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha ARM, in collaboration with Nokia and Enea, has established the OFP Foundation. OFP is revamping the TCP/IP stack for the high-capacity networks of the future. ARM Holdings (NASDAQ: ARMH ), Nokia (NYSE: NOK ) and IT services player Enea have taken a new initiative to reinvigorate the age-old TCP/IP stack for tomorrow's high-capacity networks. These networks will be driven by increased throughput and significant reduction in latency compared to today's networks. The three companies founded the OpenFastPath (OFP) Foundation for creating an open source TCP/IP stack for tomorrow's networks. Will this new initiative challenge Intel (NASDAQ: INTC )? No, it will not. Intel's reference architecture for the telcos will play an important role in high-capacity network applications of the future. Such applications will flourish utilizing the convergence of telco data center and SDN (software-defined networks). In addition, NFV (network functions virtualization) also will drive the adoption these network applications. Intel's effort to integrate SDN and NFV on standard x86 platforms made it well positioned in this area. As a result, ARM's initiative will be beneficial for Intel. ARM has a long way to go before reaping the benefits of the initiative. Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE: HPE ), AMD (NASDAQ: AMD ), Cavium (NASDAQ: CAVM ), Freescale and Linaro also are supporting the initiative by joining the OFP Foundation. Since fast-path data movement can significantly boost the performance of an application that moves lots of data by reducing CPU utilization, the initiative could be highly productive. The OFP Foundation will form a developer community that will change the current TCP/IP stack to fast-path TCP/IP stack. The new TCP/IP stack that will be optimized for SDN will support faster packet transfer utilizing low IP latency and high data rate. The open source FreeBSD operating system, which is a Unix-like OS, will support the new fast-path TCP/IP stack. The fast-path TCP/IP stack will boost the development of the 5G standard since high throughput coupled with extremely low latency will be the building block of the 5G mobile communications system. 5G will be in the forefront of the Tactile Internet where machines instead of humans will be primarily involved in communications. Tactile Internet will change the Internet of the future and its impact on society by building a completely new digital infrastructure. The new digital infrastructure will take TCP/IP away from the kernel space to the user space. According to Intel : For 15 years, the traditional thinking behind high performance networking has been to take all the packet processing functionality and push as much as possible into the kernel. That model has been changing as the cost of always crossing the divide between kernel and user space, context switching on interrupts to service packets, and copying the data has limited performance of packet processing applications. Scaling for performance on multicore systems has led to new approaches in architecting network software. For example, all the functionality and processing the kernel has been doing including the network drivers is now being placed directly into the user space application and the application now is assuming direct control of NUMA, core affinity, and parallelism. With the mobile processing field fast getting saturated, ARM is desperately trying to gain market share in the server chip business. The advent of telco data centers could be a significant opportunity for ARM. The new TCP/IP stack will support all processor architectures, including x86, PowerPC and ARM. The mere fact that the new TCP/IP stack will support ARM architecture will not ensure long-term success for ARM in the new field of communication processing including 5G. ARM knows very well that it needs to remain relevant in the entire process by expanding the horizon of its hugely successful mobile ecosystem in cloud and IoT. ARM's development of TrustZone, a set of security extensions for ARM CPUs, is a step in the right direction. Furthermore, to make its CPUs fit for IoT, ARM has developed an mbed IoT device platform, which is encouraging. With establishing the OFP Foundation, ARM has solidified its ecosystem further in an effort to combat Intel's new x86 platform in the networking marketplace. The advantage of Intel's new x86 platform (that works by integrating SDN and NFV) over the generic x86 platform is that the latter provides only capex savings for telecom operators while the former is capable of providing both capex and opex savings. Intel's series of coprocessors coupled with baseband processing supports its Xeon server chips. Moreover, it has a host of hardware and software tools in its arsenal for boosting the performance and efficiency of telco data centers. That's why Nokia depends on Intel for providing solutions to its telecom customers, despite the fact that it's collaborating with ARM for developing a fast-path TCP/IP stack. However, Nokia's collaboration with ARM also means that ARM is still in the race. But, as I said above, ARM has a long way to go before reaping the benefits of establishing the OFP Foundation. Intel's ONP (open network platform) server reference architecture that was introduced in 2014 offers a simplified approach to accelerate the adoption of SDN and NFV. For developing a sustainable ecosystem, Intel relies on open source software components. Various new and emerging standards, such as Open vSwitch, OpenFlow, OpenDaylight and OpenStack, are associated with Intel's ONP server reference design. Intel's offerings help telecom operators lower their costs, both opex and capex, by virtualizing their data center resources. If ARM wants to become successful, it has to make sure its products also result in cost savings. I believe competition is healthy for an emerging industry as it helps make progress at a rapid pace. Intel's competitive advantage is so strong that it's helping the company reap benefits from its rival's initiative. This is another reason for owning Intel's stock.
