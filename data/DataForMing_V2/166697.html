Activist Investing Daily: Is Yahoo Done? | Seeking Alpha Things continue to get worse for Yahoo. Which comes as activist Starboard Value is dumping its shares. Trian makes headway at a recent campaign. Another broad look at what's going on with some key activist campaigns. Look for a transition later this week into a more thematic setup, including mining and foods focused highlights. Shares of Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) are now off close to 40% year-to-date. The Starboard Value activist target has been under pressure to spin off its Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) stake. Starboard Value has been selling off its stake of late and apparently just in time. With the IRS denying Yahoo's request to spin off Alibaba tax-free, shares have been pushed below $30 a share. Granted, they did not say the spin-off would be fully taxed. There's been a lot of bullishness floating around Yahoo. It turns out that the market was more efficient in pricing Yahoo than most expected. If Yahoo had spun off its Alibaba stake months ago, fully-taxed, shareholders would be more wealthy today. Even still, Yahoo is continuing to push the spin off ahead. Pleasant Lake Partners offered to buy MagnaChip (NYSE: MX ) the other week for $10 a share. The premium was about a 30% premium to the unaffected price. Shares took a few days, but it's been moving higher of late. However, at $9.10, shares are still 10% below the buyout price. This comes as the activist fund had fielded calls from shareholders that what's been going on (the status quo) is no longer acceptable. Although Pleasant Lake has made its own offer, it's noted in the past that a strategic acquirer could be interested. Pleasant Lake isn't an obvious or strategic buyer, but shareholders are taking a liking to the offer. The fund owns 9.9%, including shares that it paid between $7.66 to $9.71 a share for. One of Nelson Peltz and his Trian Partners' recent activist campaigns has been taking a beating. Shares of Pentair (NYSE: PNR ) are off 21% since the hedge fund revealed its 7.2% activist stake. The valve maker is putting Trian's cofounder Ed Garden on the board. Expanding the board to 12 members. Pentair has been struggling with weakness in Europe and other parts of the world. The addition of Train to the board looks to be part of its own plan to turn Pentair into an acquirer. As I noted earlier this year, "Trian wants PNR to use that cash flow for another purpose, arguing that it can create value for shareholders by facilitating industry consolidation via accretive M&A."
