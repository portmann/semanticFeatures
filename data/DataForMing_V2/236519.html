ETF Hub Nov 15 2015, 15:11 ET | About: Facebook (FB) | By: Eli Hoffmann, CEO , SA News Editor Since Oct. 30, Andreessen has sold 73% of his Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) stake for about $160M. He also sold 90% of his class A shares. Andreessen’s shares were sold via a prearranged trading plan. Still, the sale is noteworthy; it’s uncommon for executives to sell at the pace and quantity that Andreessen has been selling these past two weeks. Thats what stocks are for and thats the name of the game. Whenever your projected moment comes you will also sell. It was a prearranged trade.  The date of sale was decided when he was awarded the stock as I understand it. This was posted before. Nice try with the negative news. Except for complaints, they're on autopilot.  Articles -- some incoherent, some padded with boilerplate -- are published, suggesting no editorial scrutiny.  On the Web, alas, clickbait rules. Exactly. And he has a gigantic fortune of his own unrelated to FB which presumably is under active management by someone. If you interpret this as a signal to sell FB then you probably should not be in the name at all. It might be uncommon for a founder or c-level executive to liquidate in that manner. Not so much the investor waiting on a return to move on to other adventures. As is often the case on SA, I learn more from some of the comments than I do from the articles and news reports. That is old news now!  I would like to know the opinions of what the markets and FB will do on Monday and this coming week after the Paris event that took place after the markets closed on Friday. It just makes sense for him to spread that money around and take cash. he could put a tiny fraction of that into realty income and be totally set for life.
