Windstream launches fiber expansion in Nashville - Windstream Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:WIN) | Seeking Alpha Jun  3 2016, 13:04 ET | About: Windstream Holdings, Inc. (WIN) | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Windstream Holdings ( WIN +0.8%) today says it's launching a major expansion of its metro fiber network in Nashville, Tenn. The move means increased connection of its fiber network to major data centers and commercial buildings in downtown, West End/Elliston Place, Midtown/Vanderbilt, Green Hills, Brentwood, Airport/Donelson and Cool Springs. This is our provider of choice and we happen to own shares in a trust [non-discretionary account], so we are LONG so to speak. Be that as it may, from a consumer point of view, we get excellent phone, internet and streaming services, and all at a lower price than we were paying Verizon, and for unlimited access and use versus metered use. Yes, we are LONG on Verizon as well, and Short and Long on AT&T, whom I like best as a safe place to grow value and income. Frontier too, Long there, but despite getting a good deal and favorable cost synergies from Verizon, I feel least well owning them, especially with a dividend that is large versus a currently earnings deficit year.
