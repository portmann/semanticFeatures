Verizon offers updated 'final' contract proposal to worker unions | Reuters Members of the Communications Workers of America (CWA) picket in front of Verizon Communications Inc. corporate offices during a strike in New York City, April 13, 2016. Verizon Communications Inc said it had presented a revised and "final" contract proposal to the unions representing nearly 40,000 workers, who have been on strike after contract talks hit an impasse. The company said on Thursday it would now offer a wage increase of 7.5 percent from its previous offer of a 6.5 percent raise over the term of the contract. "We are putting our last, best final offer on the table," Verizon's chief administrative officer Marc Reed, said in a company statement. "The ball is now in the unions' court to do what's right for our employees." Workers from network technicians to customer service representatives in Verizon's Fios Internet, telephone and TV services across several U.S. Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states, including New York and Virginia, walked off the job on April 13 in one of the largest U.S. strikes in recent years. The strike was called by the Communications Workers of America (CWA) and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. Sticking points in contract negotiations include job relocations, pensions and offshoring call center jobs. At meetings on Thursday, "executives refused to back off of callous proposals that would hurt working families and destroy middle class jobs," the CWA said in a statement. "The company also failed to budge on the issues facing Verizon Wireless workers." The union said it was considering how it would move forward. The wireline unit, which represents Verizon's legacy business, generated about 29 percent of company revenue in 2015, down about 60 percent since 2000. The company has been scaling back its Fios TV and Internet service and stopped expanding its landline phone network. Verizon, the No. 1 U.S. wireless company, has shifted focus to the bread-and-butter wireless business and new efforts in mobile video and advertising. More than a thousand union workers have returned to work, with more following suit, the company said in a statement. The strike "has had minimal impact to its operations," it added.
