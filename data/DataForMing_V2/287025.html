ETF Hub Jan 11 2016, 19:38 ET | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Star Wars: The Force Awakens drew $53M in its opening weekend in China after posting the country's best Saturday opening ever with $33M. The closely watched China total added to an estimated $145.9M in global grosses for the Walt Disney ( DIS +0.7%) film over the weekend, which propelled it past Jurassic World to make it the third-highest grossing film of all time. While a poll of theater operators figures the film to draw $200M-$330M total in China, Stifel's Benjamin Mogil thinks the film has what it takes to become the country's biggest U.S.-made movie -- and that means passing Furious 7 and its $391M total. He figures $450M in China , in fact: "The Chinese performance expectations had been somewhat of concern heading into the opening, given that the franchise is new to the market, but clearly this worry was for naught." Previously: 'Star Wars' opens to records in China (Jan. 09 2016) Happy to see the opening weekend demand.  If this one takes off in China that will bode well for DIS moving forward with several other Star Wars films in the pipeline.  Happily long DIS. Will be interesting to see how it finishes but unfortunately I can already predict analysts calling a good showing "old news" the second it happens (even though most predicted much less) and refocus the conversation on ESPN again.
