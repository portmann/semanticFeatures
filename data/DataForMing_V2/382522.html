Also covered: Intel's latest Atom CPU platform, the Mitel/Polycom deal, an Oracle ad tech acquisition, the EU's Google probe, Apple's reported 2017 iPhone plans and Tesla Model 3 reservations. Commentary and reports regarding U.S. PC web usage, Facebook chatbots, Tencent's WeChat, FCC set-top rule changes and Amazon's rumored airport-bidding efforts are covered. Amazon's Standalone Prime Video Option: A Great Marketing Stunt It's unlikely many people will sign up for the standalone Prime Video option, given the full Prime service costs just slightly more on a monthly basis, and is actually cheaper on an annual basis ($99/year vs. $108/year). To a large extent, creating a standalone video service is a marketing tactic meant to drive home to consumers the value provided by the full Prime service. 4 Reasons Why Apple Could Be Keeping iPhone Orders Low Both Apple and chip suppliers sold off on the report, which comes ahead of Apple's April 25 FQ2 report. Potential reasons output is being kept down: Forex/macro pressures, iPhone 7 anticipation, Android defections and longer smartphone upgrade cycles. Forex/macro and iPhone 7 anticipation are likely having the biggest impact. Both are short-term problems rather than causes for panic. Why Verizon Is The Clear Front-Runner To Buy Yahoo A silver lining: The new reports still indicate Verizon's interest in buying Yahoo is quite legitimate. Tim Armstrong, the head of Verizon's AOL unit, wants to build an online ad giant. And Verizon is increasingly turning to online media to offset telecom revenue pressures. Intel Has Several Potential Reasons To Launch Major Layoffs In addition to weak PC sales, the Altera acquisition, mobile loss-reduction efforts and a manufacturing strategy change could be motivating Intel to pare headcount. Mitel/Polycom Could Be Followed By More Unified Communications M&A It's official: Mitel (NASDAQ: MITL ) is acquiring (really merging) with conferencing and unified communications ("UC") hardware/software peer Polycom (NASDAQ: PLCM ) for $1.96B in cash and stock (~$300M more than what Bloomberg had reported Mitel would be paying). Mitel fell sharply on the news, and Polycom moderately. With activist Elliott Management wanting further consolidation, ShoreTel (NASDAQ: SHOR ) and other mid-market UC firms could be targeted by Mitel/Polycom. Intel reveals its Apollo Lake Atom CPU platform for tablets and low-end PCs - Apollo Lake, due in 2H16, will succeed the Cherry Trail Atom platform, and is meant for tablets, low-end notebooks, convertibles and cheap all-in-one and miniature desktops. Like Cherry Trail, Apollo Lake uses Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC ) 14nm manufacturing process and supports up to four CPU cores per chip, but it relies on a more powerful core architecture (codenamed Goldmont) and also a new GPU architecture. Battery life improvements are once more promised. Intel is trumpeting Apollo Lake's ability to deliver low-end, SSD-based, PCs that are thinner and cheaper than comparable Cherry Trail-based systems. It also argues the platform will enable more powerful Chromebooks and other sub-$300 notebooks that rely on flash storage, provide long battery life, and handle basic tasks. (Intel calls them "Cloudbooks") The chip giant is hoping the hardware enabled by Apollo Lake will strengthen a low-end consumer PC market that remains pretty weak . The education market and emerging markets users who have been relying on mobile devices (smartphones especially) for their computing needs are presumably among the segments Intel is targeting. There's always some risk a more powerful low-end platform will cannibalize sales of most costly CPUs, but (judging by ASP trends) Intel has avoided doing a lot of this with the Atom line. Apollo Lake was revealed at the Shenzhen Intel Developer Forum, along with new robot and drone development platforms. Oracle spends reported $50M to buy cross-device data provider Crosswise - Crosswise analyzes over a petabyte (1M gigabytes) of data per month to figure out which devices a particular user is relying on. Its anonymized data is sold as a subscription service to ad tech firms, publishers and brands (advertisers) looking to deliver targeted ads and/or content to users across devices. Oracle (NYSE: ORCL ), which plans to add Crosswise's tech to its Data Cloud analytics platform for brands/marketers, has been avidly snapping up ad software and data providers in recent years, looking to profit from growing digital ad spend and a shift in IT spending power towards CMOs. Past acquisitions include AddThis (sharing and personalization tools for websites that create audience data for advertisers), Datalogix (online/offline ad data), Maxymiser (tools for testing and personalizing online ad campaigns), BlueKai (marketing data management software), and Responsys and Eloqua (cloud marketing automation software firms). Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE ), Salesforce (NYSE: CRM ) and IBM (NYSE: IBM ) are among Oracle's main rivals in this space. Looking at cross-device tracking services in particular, Facebook (via its Atlas ad server/measurement platform) and Google (through its DoubleClick display ad unit) have each launched offerings. Re/code: Disney looking to invest in MLB's streaming services arm - Who would've thought a pro sports league would create a top provider of streaming services for third-party online video firms? Echoes of how AWS grew out of Amazon. MLB Advanced Media's ("MLBAM") client base includes HBO, the WWE and Disney-owned ESPN. A Disney (NYSE: DIS ) investment in MLBAM could precede an expansion of the company's web video offerings, as cord-cutting and declining U.S. TV viewing weigh on ESPN and other Disney TV properties. MLBAM rivals include Brightcove (NASDAQ: BCOV ) and Ustream ( recently acquired by IBM). Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) recently bought Elemental Technologies, which provides encoding software used by MLB and many others, but also competes with its own delivery service. KGI: Apple going with all-glass casings and OLED displays for 2017 iPhones - KGI Securities' Ming-Chi Kuo, fairly good at reporting on Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) future product plans, previously reported Apple was deciding between using glass, ceramic or plastic casing for its 2017 iPhones. Going with glass would help give the phones a premium feel, and likely be a positive for cover glass supplier Corning (NYSE: GLW ). The iPhone 4 and 4S feature glass backs, as do Samsung's Galaxy S6 and S7. Meanwhile, there have been a slew of reports indicating Apple plans to use OLEDs in future iPhones, with the most recent reports pointing to a 2017 ETA. The next version of Android will support pressure-sensitive screens - Google's ( GOOG , GOOGL ) apparent decision to add pressure-sensitive screen support to Android N follows Apple's inclusion of 3D Touch within the iPhone 6S and 6S+. To date, most of the 3D Touch work by app developers has revolved around home screen actions , but some more advanced use cases are appearing. Analog Devices (NASDAQ: ADI ) supplies a Force Touch controller IC for the 6S that enables 3D Touch, and might also land some Android design wins. Synaptics (NASDAQ: SYNA ) and Himax (NASDAQ: HIMX ) have each launched touch controllers meant from Android OEMs that support pressure-sensitive feedback. FT: EU set to launch formal antitrust charges against Google over Android - Not very surprising, given what has been reported and announced before . Google has a lot to lose if the EU (or the FTC ) forces it to stop requiring various apps/services (Maps, Gmail, YouTube, Search) be pre-installed on devices running its version of Android. Verizon preps web-based TV service relying on new set-top - Verizon's (NYSE: VZ ) video service is reportedly due to launch later this year in at least one existing FiOS market, and uses a set-top relying on technology acquired from Intel in 2014. Big Red is said to have delayed its launch due to the technical challenges involved in launching a fully IP-based service. The web-based Verizon service would follow the launch of the company's Go90 mobile video service, and compete with web TV offerings from Dish (NASDAQ: DISH ) and Sony (NYSE: SNE ). Apple has reportedly delayed its plans to join the fray due to licensing challenges. The service would be able to reach far more consumers than FiOS (had 5.8M video subs at the end of 2015), and give Verizon's wireline ops (has been seeing negative revenue growth) another tool for offsetting landline disconnections and business revenue decline. Tesla Model 3 reservations nearly reach 400K - Though Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA ) Model 3 is due to begin shipping by the end of 2017 (barring delays), the staggering number of reservations received over the last two weeks means some recent orders might not be fulfilled until 2019 or even 2020. Apple investors might want to keep an eye on the Model 3, which will sell for $35K, sports a 0-60 time of less than 6 seconds, promises a range of 215 miles, and comes with support for autopilot features (buyers will have to pay extra for some of them). With Apple reportedly looking to launch an EV in 2019, the Model 3 could be the biggest rival for Apple's much-rumored car. Two likely Model 3 beneficiaries: Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ), which has been supplying Tesla with Tegra processors for its infotainment systems, and Mobileye (NYSE: MBLY ), which has been supplying driver-assistance systems that enable autopilot features. comScore: U.S. PC Internet use is now declining - comScore estimates U.S. time spent accessing the web via PCs - it refers to all PCs as "desktops" - fell Y/Y each of the last four months, with March's decline at 6%. Not the most stunning development, but still important for many Internet firms given the gaps that often still remain between PC and mobile monetization rates. Also: The U.S. accounts for a very outsized share of ad revenue (relative to its share of active users) for Google, Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ), Yelp (NYSE: YELP ) and practically every other ad-dependent U.S. Internet company. Of course, it wouldn't be surprising to learn many other developed markets are also now seeing negative PC Internet usage growth, or are on the verge of doing so. Gizmodo: Facebook chatbots are frustrating and useless - Looks like Facebook is going to have some growing pains for its Messenger chatbot platform (the subject of much recent hype and discussion). "I realized that using these robo-assistants is like trying to talk politics with a toddler," writes Gizmodo's Darren Orf. He also argues that even effective bots typically provide just a fraction of the functionality delivered by apps. Chatbots will only be as good as the A.I., natural language-processing, and datasets underpinning them. It's still early days. Report: Tencent's WeChat tops 700M monthly active users - Tencent's ( OTCPK:TCEHY ) WeChat mobile messaging platform ended March with 706M MAUs, according to Chinese data tracker Quest Mobile. WeChat was at 697M MAUs at the end of 2015. WhatsApp (1B+ MAUs) and Facebook Messenger (900M+) may be huge elsewhere, but WeChat rules the roost in China. And it has launched a variety of value-added services (payments, online stores, gaming, ads, and yes, bots) that could be a sign of things to come for Messenger. Maybe less so for WhatsApp, given its minimalist approach. As the following chart (relies on Quest Mobile data) shows, Tencent's Mobile QQ, Video and QQ Browser apps are also big in China, as are Alibaba's (NYSE: BABA ) Taobao and Alipay apps, Baidu's (NASDAQ: BIDU ) core app and iQiyi video app, and Weibo (NASDAQ: WB ). SA contributor West Coast Growth Picks: Amazon Bids For German Airport As Freight Ambitions Continue - Looks at Amazon's reported efforts to bid for an airport near Frankfurt, Germany (a major European transport hub). The author argues the airport could link together Amazon's European warehouses (thus making Prime more attractive on the continent), and also expand its local product selection. Amazon recently leased 20 Boeing 767s in the U.S., and reportedly has plans for a global logistics network . SNL Kagan: The FCC Targets The Set-Top Box - Goes over the likely winners and losers from the FCC's plans (now officially supported by the White House) to let pay-TV subscribers use set-tops from third-party manufacturers, rather than depend on ones supplied by pay-TV providers (typically for a rental fee). Pay-TV providers are seen losing in multiple ways: A loss of control over parts of the user experience, the loss of rental fees and reduced data collection. "A moderate hit" is seen for current pay-TV set-top vendors such as Arris (NASDAQ: ARRS ) and Technicolor (bought Cisco's set-top unit). Meanwhile, tech giants are expected to benefit from set-top sales, access to viewer data, the potential to promote their own ecosystem and services.
