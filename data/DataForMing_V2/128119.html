Apple: Fiscal 2015 Was OK, But Fiscal 2016 Shaping Up To Be A Better Year - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha iPhone growth will likely be sustained based on reports of 85 million to 90 million iPhone unit orders. Emerging markets will add upside to Apple, as China and India grew at a very brisk pace in the most recent quarter. This was driven by a shift from low-end Android devices to current generation iPhone devices. I anticipate limited upside over the next three months, but anticipate a winter rally to break the key resistance level at $135. For the most part, Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) earnings weren't all that bad, but at the same time, they weren't exactly phenomenal either. The company wasn't able to sustain profit margin improvements even as it had a mix shift to higher-margin products. Furthermore, shipment figures of the iPhone, while better than expected, weren't close to the rumored figures from various supply chain sources. In other words, the company did well relative to its prior outlook, but wasn't able to meet the expectations of buy-side analysts. I'm confident Apple can sustain shipment growth in the iPhone segment going into the next fiscal year. Recent reports by The Wall Street Journal are almost a dead giveaway on what the company is projecting for Q1 FY 2016 for iPhones (85 million to 90 million units). Admittedly, there's very limited supply chain flexibility, so even if demand outstrips supply, investors shouldn't expect a surprise this quarter, because channel inventory doesn't return to more normal levels until the second quarter. The best-case scenario implies 20% shipment growth, with revenue growth roughly equivalent as price points aren't going to move much higher. Apple's growth in iPhone shipments will come from first-time adopters of the iPhone in emerging markets, along with upsells from mid- to low-end devices. Antonio Sacconaghi from Sanford C. Bernstein mentioned that Apple's market share in the $600-plus category is at 90%. So, Apple has near full saturation in the high-end of the smartphone market, and so growth is coming from mobile subscribers who previously owned a less expensive Android device that was priced in the sub-$200s. Furthermore, there's the continuing adoption of Apple devices in key emerging markets like China and India. So, I think shipment growth will be more robust in the second quarter of 2016, as there will be enough leftover production capacity from the holiday quarter to accommodate for the spillover demand. So, while Q1 year-over-year comps aren't going to be as strong, I think Q2 year-over-year comps will be more robust as the output will eventually catch up to demand. Therefore, the real quarter to watch out for isn't Q1, but actually Q2, because that will determine the amount of cumulative revenue and earnings the company will be able to generate from further saturation into the high end. The high-end is a rapidly expanding market, so there's significant potential for Apple to sustain relatively high growth rates in comparison to peers, because a 100 basis point improvement in global handset share really moves the needle when you operate at a $670 ASP. A 1% gain in market share is equivalent to 14 million iPhone units. Growth will likely exceed that due to the faster adoption of higher-end devices and the changing demand elasticities in response to higher discretionary income in emerging economies. As you can tell, I'm lowering my full-year revenue estimate from $252 billion to $231 billion. This is primarily driven by the weakness in sequential iPhone comps between Q2 and Q3 of FY 2015. I think iPhone volumes were negatively impacted by foreign exchange as pricing does impact demand assuming ceteris paribus. The company reported declining profitability over the course of FY 2015, which also impacted my financial model. Hence, my net income was off by a full $9 billion from Apple's full-year outlook. Furthermore, Q4 is a rather uneventful quarter because demand is the weakest in this quarter. Typically, demand gets pent-up in anticipation of newer devices, which forces Apple to reduce its channel inventory over the fourth quarter. The market environment has been weak, and as many of you can tell, this has weighed on the performance of your stock portfolio. If anything, investors had to be extra selective this year to generate alpha. The broader market's year-to-date performance was a meager 3.25%, so the expected return based on market volatility has dropped to the worst levels we've seen in a while. That being the case, the broader macro weakness obfuscates the relative strength of Apple's earnings and revenue. I'm operating on the assumptions of my worst-case scenario rather than the average or best-case scenario. Hence, I'm lowering my price target from $194 to $136.71. Now, remember there are only three months left to the current fiscal year, so my forecast only applies over the next three months. I think my forecast is pretty realistic and will accurately characterize the returns investors can expect over the next three-month period. I also think momentum will likely return in the holiday quarter as investors absorb more positive news and analysts begin to price their financial models to be inclusive of another year in which iPhone volumes ramp due to robust foreign demand and recovery in the tablet and Apple Watch segment. Apple is still a winning investment. And while recent volatility and weakness in sequential comps has weakened investor sentiment, the stock is likely to outperform in 2016. And by the end of the current fiscal year, I anticipate the stock to recover from $125 and trade at around $136. We'll see if three months is enough time to reverse this week's selling. But my gut is telling me that at least now investors can capture 10 more points before the stock eventually breaks out and continues its multi-year uptrend.
