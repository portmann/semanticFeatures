Verizon Flirts With Millennials - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha  |  About: Verizon Communications (VZ) , Includes: ADT , AFG , ALR , AMTG , APO , BX , CXRX , FB , GE , GLBL , GOOG , GOOGL , MS , NATL , NFLX , ODP , PEP , SUNE , TERP , TFM , TMUS , TWX , VSLR , WBA , YHOO Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) is buying virtual reality video maker RYOT to add to its Huffington Post news site. They are competing with Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) to build out their 360-degree video capabilities. RYOT has produced content for corporate clients including Walgreens (NASDAQ: WBA ) and Pepsi (NYSE: PEP ). As one can surmise from the company's name (pronounced "riot"), Verizon is trying to appeal to the cool kids. On their quarterly call , Verizon's CFO said that, I mean if you just look at the most recent acquisition we just did with RYOT, this is a real unique 360-degree video production. It is for really Huff Post [Huffington Post], for them to increase their viability on producing videos for news. But again this goes to our strategy in attacking a certain population that quite honestly Verizon is underpenetrated in. And if you look at that acquisition it directly goes to Gen Z. 73% of their audience is Millennials. So these are real strategic for us to improve the viability of that platform. Unfortunately, there is nothing less cool than older people trying to sound as if they "get it". According to T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS ), Verizon is suffering from a midlife crisis. T-Mobile points out that Verizon is going on a shopping spree, buying AOL, AwesomenessTV, Complex Media, and perhaps Yahoo! (NASDAQ: YHOO ). According to a T-Mo blog post , Verizon averaged one mention of "the millennials" every 5 minutes on their last earnings call. In an effort to be as hip as Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ), Google ( GOOG / GOOGL ) and Time Warner's (NYSE: TWX ) HBO, Verizon is squandering billions of dollars on Go90, a mobile video app vaguely targetingâ€¦ millennials. T-Mo's suggestions for alternative uses of the money: General Electric (NYSE: GE ) is about to reach the one on one phase of the sale process of GE Capital Interbanca. The likely buyer is either Apollo (NYSE: APO ) or Banca Ifis. Concordia (NASDAQ: CXRX ) formed a special committee to consider strategic alternatives in response to buyout interest from Blackstone (NYSE: BX ). The ADT (NYSE: ADT ) shareholder vote is today on the acquisition of the company. The $0.20 net arbitrage spread offers a 7% IRR if the deal closes next month. National Interstate (NASDAQ: NATL ) is working with Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ) on their response to the American Financial (NYSE: AFG ) $30 per share takeover offer. Bump? This makes sense for the buyer at $30 and for the seller at $35. Maybe they can meet somewhere in the middle. Alere (NYSE: ALR ) is successfully working on a deal with its creditors that would grant the company two more months to file its 2015 financial disclosures without triggering a default on its debt.
