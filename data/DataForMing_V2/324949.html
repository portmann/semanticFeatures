Netflix: Mark Cuban Is Nervous, And So Are We - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Our bearish thesis from late 2015 is unfolding and we appear to have underestimated the extent to which the market may revalue Netflix. At NFLX's current price of $89 per share, the company still trades at an irrational level; we expect further selling pressure in 2016 and have lowered our PT. Our price target is now $65-$70, or 22%-27% downside from current price, as US growth slows, significant challenges remain in international markets and NFLX raises additional debt. On December 14, when Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) was trading at $118.91 per share and the stock was approaching record highs, we published Netflix is Positioned for a Major Stumble in 2016 and said the following: Several warning signs are emerging at Netflix and these cautionary indicators suggest that the stock has far outpaced the fair value of the business and a correction is likely to occur in 2016. Based on our outlook, we believe Netflix is overvalued by at least 30%-35% and there are several catalysts in place that may spark a sell-off in 2016. In our view, investors in Netflix should proceed with caution in 2016 and prepare for the possibility of a substantial correction in the stock price given the extreme optimism the bull case is based upon and the implications of even a modest shortfall to these expectations. With the stock now trading at $89.23 and 25% below the $118.91 price at the time of our initial projection, we are reducing our one-year target price from $80-$85 per share to $65-$70 per share. Earlier in the month, Netflix traded briefly below $80 per share before rebounding and regaining some of its losses. However, we believe this price momentum is temporary and the stock may fall an additional 22%-27% over the next twelve months. We believe Netflix's subscriber growth momentum in the U.S. streaming market will slow more dramatically than originally anticipated and expansion in the international streaming markets will be far more challenging than management expects, particularly in China. Given our revised outlook, the still frothy valuation at an enterprise value of $35.5 billion and the unabated selling over the past month, we believe investors should remain cautious and stay on the sidelines until the stock reaches our twelve month price target of $65-$70 per share. In our view, the company's fourth quarter results show signs of fundamental weakness despite the fact that company exceeded consensus expectations for EPS ($0.07 adjusted EPS compared to estimates of $0.03) and narrowly missed on revenue ($1.82 billion compared to estimates of $1.83 billion). We are concerned by the lower U.S. net adds in the fourth quarter, which were 5% below our conservative estimate for net adds. We have therefore lowered are forecast for 2016-2020. We now expect total US members to reach 61.07 million by 2020, down 2.3% from our previous projection. This revised projection reflects the continual erosion of Netflix's leadership position in the US as Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Prime gains momentum and to a lesser extent, Hulu. Hyper-competition in a saturated market will lead to lower prices, which will put tremendous pressure on Netflix's operating margins. In our view, an increase in the US contribution margin to 40% by 2020 is very unlikely. With the margin currently at 34%, we believe it may tick up in 2016 to 35%, but the long-term trend suggests it may revert to the low 30s. With that being said, the most significant risk to the bull thesis is lower international growth. Many of the bulls argue that robust international growth justifies Netflix's current valuation and even a substantially higher valuation. We strongly disagree with this conclusion and believe investors are significantly overestimating the amount of growth management will achieve in international subscribers over the next five years as well as in the long-term. In addition to intense competition, there are three significant hurdles that will prevent Netflix from replicating the success of its U.S. business on a global scale and the company will ultimately do very poorly by following its current international expansion strategy. The first hurdle is the creation of content that is original, relevant and matches the language of the local market. Countries where there is a language match, we would expect to see the company do well. But in other markets, content creation will be very expensive and success will be far from guaranteed. In fact, we believe in the next five years management will have to reevaluate which international markets are viable and have promise. In countries where Netflix's business model is not viable, we would expect to see an exit and an impairment of investments in the market. Secondly, the payment terms and systems in each market will pose various challenges for management. There may be markets where many consumers do not have access to credit or debit cards. The introduction of gift cards and prepaid cards will require significant investments and it is not certain whether the consumer will adopt these forms of payments. Additionally, consumers in certain international markets will likely be more price sensitive. Thirdly, the cost of complying with local regulations in the aggregate will be substantial. In many countries, Netflix will be required to build a presence, hire staff, pay local taxes and licensing fees and comply with censorship laws. We believe this factor will provide an additional headwind for Netflix. In the face of these significant hurdles, Netflix will also have to overcome existing and strong local competitors. In our view, the road ahead for Netflix will be very challenging and Netflix's valuation does not currently reflect this. With management launching in 130 countries on January 6th, we believe expectations are far too high and only a small portion of these countries represent attractive long-term markets for Netflix. For the most part, the economics of the various international markets will be vastly different than the economics Netflix has enjoyed in the US. As a result, we believe there will be significantly lower market penetration internationally and Netflix will experience sustained operating losses in excess of $120 million. We believe the overly ambition expansion plans will drive operating losses in excess of $150 million per quarter by 2017. Based on our projections for growth, we now expect revenue to increase from $8.5 billion in 2016 to $16.9 billion in 2020. We expect Netflix to earn $1.03 per share in 2020. At the current stock price of $89.23 per share, the stock is trading at 86 times projected 2020 EPS. The projections are not without risk. If the company continues to burn through cash (free cash flow totaled -$276 million in Q4 and -$921 million in 2015) to develop original content, earnings per share will decline. The company will be forced to issue net debt to cover the cash shortfall and interest expense and leverage will increase dramatically over the next five years. The company already indicated that it will raise additional debt in late-2016 or early-2017. We believe this suggests that the company may fail to meet our conservative growth projections through 2020 which would lower the stock further below our price target. Mark Cuban, who disclosed his substantial stake in Netflix in 2014, recently announced that he bought puts against his entire position in Netflix. This is not exactly a vote of confidence by a well-informed long-term shareholder. We believe he will ultimately sell his shares and may take advantage of the recent near-term rebound in the stock price to the high-80s to sell a portion of his position. Furthermore, we believe many bulls who believe the increased competition and lower profits in the US will be overshadowed by sustained and robust international growth may be in for an unpleasant surprise. With a trailing PE of well over 300, forward PE over 80 and EV/EBITDA of 105, we believe Netflix's stock price is still irrational and the degree to which the stock price contracts is unknown. Based our reasonable assumptions for US and international growth, we still see a further decline in the stock price in the next year of 20%-24% to $65-$70 per share. The selloff may take the price lower and we will closely monitor Q1 results and provide updates to our price target during 2016.
