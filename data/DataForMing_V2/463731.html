Parents of boy killed by alligator won't sue Disney - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Jul 20 2016, 11:51 ET | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Disney ( DIS -1.4%) is avoiding what could be costly litigation as the parents of a 2-year-old child killed by an alligator at a company resort are saying they won't sue the entertainment giant . "We know that we can never have Lane back, and therefore, we intend to keep his spirit alive through the Lane Thomas Foundation," say parents Matt and Melissa Graves. "In addition to the foundation, we will solely be focused on the future health of our family and will not be pursuing a lawsuit against Disney." The boy was playing in the water on a beach area at the Grand Floridian, across a lake from the Magic Kingdom, when an alligator dragged him underwater . The boy's body was found after a search. I think it would be a good idea for Disney to donate some money to the Foundation in good faith.
