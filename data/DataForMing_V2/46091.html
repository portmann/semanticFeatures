The Smart Way To Analyze Stocks: A Look At Boeing - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Rather than using trendy trading strategies and listening to headlines, it is better to invest with numbers. Simple research on the fundamentals reveal value. Boeing's strong business is a perfect example for research. Note: Unless otherwise noted, data used are obtained from Yahoo Finance and Nasdaq.com. With today's constant barrage of news headlines, it is getting harder and harder to be objective about stocks. Admittedly, when you turn on CNBC and see "GM sales plummet", it scares the heck out of you. Last year when for one week you read "Marijuana stocks skyrocket" everyone had a real urge to run out and buy up the next million-dollar idea. Confession: I am guilty of this one. Had I actually done my homework and looked at the numbers, I would have seen the marijuana play as merely speculation. As an investor, the only thing that matters is if they're profitable. You need a system for analyzing stocks. Ironically enough, people don't talk a lot about specific ways to grade equities. They just throw analysts' comments and ratings at you. Not to say that analysts aren't a very smart and and important part of the equation, but everyone should know how to do their own homework. When buying a company, we need to look at the whole picture. Boeing (NYSE: BA ) recently announced earnings numbers. Implementing pieces of a simple, straightforward analysis strategy , let's use Boeing as an example. Start with revenues. If they're not bringing in money, that's a pretty big red flag up front. I like at least 4 quarters to get a good picture. The June 30, 2014 quarterly data have Boeing's total revenue listed at $22,045,000,000. (Sigh, so much money.) Looking at the last 4 quarters, you can see that revenue (despite making gains through September and December) has increased going into April, but only slightly at about 0.4%. If you check out the year over year revenue growth above, you'll see that Boeing has progressively improved revenue streams by 11% over the last full 3 years. With positive revenues all around, Boeing passes. Who doesn't love dividends? Boeing has a forward annual dividend of $3.64 at a 2.4% yield. It's not the best, but it's not the worst. Due to the lack of a full year for 2015, this EPS is off of the current (March 31) earnings. Year over year we have a 46% increase in earnings per share. That is a starkly better figure than what happened from 2014 to 2013. Though return on equity increased over the last year showcasing an improvement in managements efficiency, it is preferable to have at least 2 demonstrable years of gains. 11 out of 17 analysts, including Barclays Capital, Stifel Nicolaus, Edward Jones and Wells Fargo, rate Boeing as a strong buy . 5 listed it as a hold. Only 1 rated it as a sell. To add perspective to these analysts, the company does seem to consistently beat their earnings estimates, as can be seen in the following table: Though no one is a psychic, these overall increasing forecast estimates imply good feelings towards Boeing's future performance. Considering their huge involvement with the military this shouldn't come as a surprise. Furthermore, the 5-year earnings growth forecast of 11.32% (anything over 8% is fair game) implies that analysts have a fairly good belief that Boeing is going to deliver over the coming years. The PEG ratio is like the Price/Earnings ratio but on steroids because it incorporates growth rates. You find it by dividing your P/E by the 12 month growth rate of the stock. The important thing to know is that if it's less than 1.0 you're golden. Your stocks price/earnings is less than your growth rate. You can cheat like I do and look it up here . With a PEG ratio of 1.53, Boeing hits a red flag. I like this one quite a bit. The chart below shows the number of shares traded by insiders in the company. As you can see, there has been quite a bit of selling. What's fun about analyzing insider trades is there could be a number of reasons for the selloff. In certain situations it could mean things are going poorly and the employees know it, or it could mean nothing. It could be just a random event. In this particular case, I think it's the fact that the stock is up over $20 in the past 3 months and people are taking profits. Always err on the side of caution on this one. If insiders are selling, it's not a good sign. Last but not least, is the share price appreciating? How can we forget? The only point in owning stock is to increase wealth, right? Ergo, Our number 1 concern is always "is the stock going up or down?". In this case, over the 5 year period Boeing is up over 50%. That's a pretty clear indicator of good times for shareholders. Gross profit is up 9% over the past 3 years while net income is up 39%. Combine these kinds of numbers with the recent earnings beat,the stock has a very realistic chance of hitting the 1 year target of $160. To play devils advocate against myself, I would like to see better cash flows from the company, but with their earnings per share beats I can forgive it. When making long term investments, look at stocks by the numbers. Day traders may get away with investing based on headlines, but they also endure lots of risk. Have criteria by which you gauge your stocks. In Boeing's case, the increases in earnings per share are indicative of good things to me. Furthermore, the fact that Boeing keeps beating its estimates says that many are underestimating this stock. The company also has higher demand for its planes than it can provide for. That is basically the greatest problem for any firm selling a product to have. For these reasons, Boeing is a great long-term buy.
