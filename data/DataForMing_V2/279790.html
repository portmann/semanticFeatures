Yahoo's Core Is An Ideal LBO Target - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I am/we are long YHOO. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. Shares of Yahoo have not recovered to the same extent as Alibaba. Yahoo's board has cancelled the proposed Alibaba spinoff, but is now exploring a potential sale of the core business.. Yahoo's core business would make an ideal LBO target for a PE firm. Through the sale of the core and not the Alibaba stake the tax liability would be reduced and shareholder value would increase. It is no secret that approximately three-fourths of Yahoo's (NASDAQ: YHOO ) current value is directly linked to the company's 384 million share stake in Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ). This investment has resulted in a strong correlation between shares of Yahoo and Alibaba, with Yahoo's price tracking that of Alibaba. The graphic below illustrates this fairly well. Notice that during the summer months both stocks slid in lockstep as concerns regarding Chinese growth led to mass selling in anything China related. However, as these concerns have eased, shares of Alibaba have recovered much more quickly than Yahoo, creating an opportunity for investors. Some may credit this recovery gap to the board's recent decision to cancel the proposed spinoff of the company's Alibaba holding amidst concerns regarding the potential taxation of the assets in the spin. However, the board did disclose that they were still attempting to unlock value through divestitures and would explore other options including the sale of Yahoo's core business. It appears as though they are following through on the plan, contacting potential buyers for a plot of land in Silicon Valley that should fetch north of $100 million . The exploration of new value-enhancing options could lead to the sale of Yahoo's core business, but what company's would be interested? For starters, Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) has been rumored as a potential buyer after purchasing AOL for $4.4 billion. Additionally, companies such as Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) (CMCSK), Time Warner Cable (NYSE: TWC ), News Corp (NASDAQ: NWS ) and Time Warner (NYSE: TWX ) have all been rumored to have expressed interest in all or some of the assets in Yahoo's internet business. Despite all the potential public interest, the most likely buyer, in my opinion would be a private equity firm for a few reasons. First off, while the business may be in decline, it does generate sizable cash flows in a somewhat mature industry. Secondly, the management team at Yahoo has been under fire lately, with some demanding a change in leadership, citing a lack of innovation and value creation from current CEO Marissa Mayer. Regardless if you agree with the Mayer critics or not, it's easy to see the lack of confidence in her by a multitude of investors. Additionally, Yahoo appears to lack a viable plan to organically grow the business moving forward. The only value creation expected in the near future would be from the sale of assets and investments. Stable cash flows, management issues and lack of a future growth plans are characteristics that most private equity targets have in common. Not to mention the fact that many companies have been rumored to express interest in pieces of Yahoo's core business. These pieces (business segments like Tumblr, BrightRoll or Flury) could be broken off and sold individually by a PE firm, reducing the potential downside in such a transaction. Taking all of this into account, it would appear as though Yahoo could be a prime candidate for a leveraged buyout by a private equity firm. Looking at the core business in this manor, what would a PE firm be willing to pay? In order to find a plausible purchase price, I constructed a simple LBO model. PE firms that are involved in leveraged buyouts typically have a 3-5 year turnaround in which they attempt to pay down the debt used to fund the purchase and re-sell the company. In the model above, the estimated exit date is 2018, implying a holding period of three years. The borrowing capacity in the model is set at six times TTM EBITDA, implying initial borrowings of $6.876 billion. All free cash flows over the minimum cash balance are expected to go toward the paying down of the debt in each of the proceeding years. This is shown in the debt schedule. Revenue is forecasted to continue to deteriorate slowly year-over-year, while EBITDA and FCF margins are frozen after 2015 to simulate increased cost cutting once the company would be taken private. Based on these estimates, a 2x multiple on 2018 EBITDA would imply a future resale value of just under $1.7 billion. Adding projected net cash of $2 billion generates a total implied equity value at resale of roughly $3.7 billion. Assuming the financial sponsor in this scenario would require a 30% return on investment, the most they would be willing to shell out today before taking on debt would be about $1.7 billion. Applying the estimated 6x leverage to the purchase implies a total plausible purchase price of Yahoo's core internet business of $8.58 billion. Reconciling this estimate with the other major Yahoo holdings generates an implied equity value of $40.62 per share. This estimate includes a 10% discount to current market value for the company's Alibaba and Yahoo Japan stakes. The discount was deemed necessary because the two holdings would still be packaged together and the only way to separate them would be a future sale or spinoff, at which point taxation would need to be accounted for. The major reason for the creation of value here is based on the difference in expected tax liability for the sale of the core business vs. the sale of the Alibaba stake. In this instance, the tax bill is estimated to be at most $3.4 billion, where as the spinoff of the 384 million Alibaba shares would result in potential taxation of $12.5 billion. Based on the assumptions made above, the fair enterprise value of Yahoo's parts is 21% higher than the stock's current price. This value could be unlocked by the exploration and successful execution of a sale of the core business. And in my opinion, the most likely buyer of the core would be a PE firm because of the company's steady cash flows and salable assets. Through the sale of the company's core, the board of directors would essentially back its way into a holding company that would consist of the Alibaba and Yahoo Japan stakes. Then, if they so choose, the company could explore the sale of its Yahoo Japan holding to truly create an Alibaba spinoff without the tax liability. Tagged: Investing Ideas , Technology
