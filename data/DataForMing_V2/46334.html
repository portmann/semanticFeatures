Disney: An Entertainment Company Worth Looking At - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Even after spiking due to stellar performance last quarter, Disney remains a buy. Strong financials coupled with attractive news going forward will boost the stock significantly. With strong catalysts and financials, Disney (NYSE: DIS ) is a must-own moving into earnings season. Over the past 5 years Disney stock has grown from about $40 to nearly $110, a staggering 195.03% growth. It currently carries an attractive P/E of 24 and a PEG ratio of 1.55. The industry carries ratios of 50 and 1.59, respectively. Although this company has grown 39.64% over the past year (largely due to its stellar 4Q14 earnings report and revenue from Frozen), I believe this entertainment giant is still in for a nice surprise. First and foremost, Disney dominates the movie production industry. Frozen alone, accruing $402 million, is credited for moving Disney's annual revenue to $49 billion, an absurd amount and an all time high for the company. Recently, Disney has been piggybacking on Frozen's success by introducing a Frozen short film, announcing an upcoming sequel, and presenting "Frozen: Early Science" apps as a part of its expansion of its Imagicademy suite of leaning experiences. Additionally, over the next five years the company expects to expand its Pixar and Marvel universes. Avengers Age of Ultron, predicted to lead the summer movies in gross revenue, is only the second of a total of four upcoming Avenger movies. Analysts are expecting opening weekend to hit roughly $200 million and annual gross revenue to surpass the $1.5 billion mark set by Age of Ultron's predecessor, Avengers. Fandago recently came out with a statement saying this film is responsible for 95% of its weekend ticket sales. Other highly anticipated Marvel movies set to boost Disney's revenue are Antman, Dr. Strange, Captain America Civil War, and Guardians of the Galaxy 2. As for Pixar and Star Wars; the Good Dinosaur, Finding Dory, and Star Wars: Episode 7 are coming out within the year. Also, Disney just announced that it will be producing its first Star Wars video game since purchasing rights to the franchise in 2013. Because of incredible past growth and future prospects stemming from Disney's phenomenal management and noteworthy subsidiaries, expect an earnings beat this quarter. Moreover, expect an increased dividend payout. Last quarter Disney increased its annual payout from 86 cents to $1.15 a 34% jump on top of its 15% increase from 2013. Although the yield is just 1.1%, with a boost in revenue this upcoming quarter, Disney is surely destined to share some of its wealth with investors. Companies with large amounts of cash tend to increase dividend payout. In order to become an even more attractive stock Disney must boost up its yield to further compete with competitors like Time Warner (NYSE: TWX ). Time Warner is currently trading at $85 and holds a 1.6% yield. The following chart taken from Nasdaq.com indicates an upward slowing dividend yield trend. Disney's dividend has improved 187.5% in the past five years and there are no signs of it slowing down now. Please view the chart copied from Nasdaq.com: Although Disney past performance isn't necessarily indicative of future events, four consecutive earnings beats is quite an accomplishment. I believe with the aforementioned innovative projects set to get underway, Disney's future EPS is highly underestimated. They should without a doubt beat earnings going forward as well. Aside from the incredible cash in-flow culminating from its movie industry, Disney has more in store for investors and Disney fans around the world. The Shanghai Park set to open in January of 2016 will prove to be another huge form of future revenue for Disney. Tapping into China will boost revenue in ways Walt Disney could have only dreamed of attaining. Currently, theme parks account for 30% of Disney revenue; a new park will make an astronomical difference for the company. "The park will be a key legacy of Chief Executive Robert Iger, who plans to retire in June of 2018" (Wall Street Journal) Under Bob Iger's management Disney is a must buy going into earnings season. The movie industry is endless, Shanghai will revolutionize the game, Disney will continue to maximize profit intake from its many subsidiary businesses, and it will boost dividend payout.
