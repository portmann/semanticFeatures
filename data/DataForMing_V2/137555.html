Apple: There Won't Be An iPhone 6s Bump - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Some seem to expect a bump in iPhone 6s sales coming from iPhone 5s upgraders. No such bump is likely. There are several reasons for this, including an overwhelming one. However, there's the chance that this might already be in the consensus expectations. Still, the last time this happened the stock languished for 9 months. There's the theory out there, sometimes repeated in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) article comments, that the iPhone 6s will be favored by the iPhone 5s bump. This is based on iPhone 5s users coming off contract and finally being able to upgrade to the iPhone 6s. The larger display was the main selling point of the iPhone 6. There was certainly massive pent-up demand for a larger Apple smartphone, as Android had larger displays for years. That pent-up demand exhausted itself when Apple launched the iPhone 6. Indeed, it's likely that the iPhone 6 got more upgraders from the previous generation than any time before, so more people probably already upgraded from the iPhone 5s than one would expect. The iPhone 6s will provide rather limited new features. It's bound to have a faster SoC, it will finally have a higher-resolution camera and it will include Force touch. Apple had been lagging on the camera megapixel department for a while, but people never noticed it because photos are more and more kept and displayed on digital devices instead of printed. And the devices (TVs, tablets, smartphones aren't even there yet) only recently started using 4K resolutions, which match what the iPhone could already produce (8 MP). The iPhone camera's image quality and speed was already excellent, so this time Apple will be a victim of its own success, meaning a 12 MP or 16 MP camera won't be much of an attraction. The faster SoC and Force Touch should either be rather imperceptible ((SoC)) or a gimmick (Force Touch). In short, these aren't the kind of features which drive a massive migration like the large display did. Finally, and this is the most important point, the iPhone 5s did not make for a huge jump in unit sales itself. This, together with the fact that it's likely more 5s users than usual already went for the larger display on the iPhone 6, means there's no much-increased base to draw upgraders from. The following chart shows this well: (Source: Statista.com , annotated in red by me) As we can see, the jump in unit sales from the 4 to the 4s, the 4s to the 5 and the 5s to the 6 were massive. But the jump in unit sales from the 5 to the 5s was minor. It's this lack of a bump from the iPhone 5 to the iPhone 5s that makes it very unlikely for Apple to see a major bump from iPhone 5s upgraders into the iPhone 6s. That said, this isn't necessarily a large negative. Why? Because it looks like the market already expects it in a way. Check the present revenue growth consensus: (Source: Yahoo Finance , red highlights are mine) It would seem that the analyst consensus is already discounting precisely the thesis I am putting forward here: that the iPhone 6s won't see a large bump in sales when compared to the iPhone 6. One should also keep in mind that these low revenue growth estimates include an entirely new product category - the Apple Watch. Even just 15 million Apple Watches @$500 over a year would provide $7.5 billion in added revenues. Thus, that consensus for 4.8% growth in the year to September 2016 actually means just 1.6% growth if we were to exclude the impact from as few as 15 million Apple Watches (which, mind you, would already be a very low expectation for that product). Anyway, the last time Apple saw such low revenue growth expectations the stock didn't fare well for around 9 months. Apple is the iPhone. Nothing else matters. If the iPhone falters, Apple falters. The iPhone is more than 2/3rds of Apple's revenues (69.4% as of FQ2) and certainly over 80% of its profits. There is good reason to believe the iPhone 6s won't enjoy a bump from iPhone 5s upgraders. The iPhone 5s didn't enjoy much of a bump over the iPhone 5, so there is no pent-up demand from off contract iPhone 5s upgraders when compared to iPhone 5 upgraders. Since Apple is basically the iPhone in what matters (earnings), any lack of growth on its iPhone franchise turns into lack of growth for Apple as a whole. What can an investor do? This might already be discounted. After all, Apple's revenue growth consensus going forwards is already very weak. However, the last time such low growth expectations happened, Apple's stock languished for 9 months before regaining its footing as the iPhone 5s approached. Here's how the stock did: (Source: Stockcharts.com , red highlights are mine) So if the same thing happens now, given the presently low growth consensus going forward, an Apple investor would do well to be conservative in his buying/holding of the stock. It's likely that he'll get a lot of chances to buy lower.
