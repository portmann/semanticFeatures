(NYSE:JBL) | Seeking Alpha Ranking the top twenty Russell 1000 tech stocks, according to principles of the well-known investor Joseph Piotroski. Explanation and back-testing of the "All-Stars: Piotroski" ranking system. Highlights and a buy recommendation for the second-ranked stock of the system; Jabil Circuit. Tech stocks have outperformed the market in the last year. The average return of the 150 tech stocks that are included in the Russell 1000 index (included dividends) in the last 52 weeks has been at 21.6%, while the Russell 1000 index has returned 9.87%. Moreover, 110 stocks among the 150 tech stocks have achieved a positive return in the last year. A Ranking system sorts stocks from best to worst based on a set of weighted factors. Portfolio123 has a powerful ranking system which allows the user to create complex formulas according to many different criteria. They also have highly useful several groups of pre-built ranking systems; I used one of them the "All-Stars: Piotroski" in this article. The ranking system is based on investing principles of the well-known investor Joseph Piotroski. The "All-Stars: Piotroski" ranking system is quite complex, and it is taking into account many factors like; price to book value (50% weight), gross margin, debt, current ratio, return on assets and shares buyback. In order to find out how such a ranking formula would have performed during the last 17 years, I ran a back-test, which is available by the Portfolio123's screener. For the back-test, I took all the 6,549 stocks in the Portfolio123's database. The back-test results are shown in the chart below. For the back-test, I divided the 6,549 companies into twenty groups according to their ranking. The chart clearly shows that the average annual return has a very significant positive correlation to the "All-Stars: Piotroski" rank. The highest ranked group with the ranking score of 95-100, which is shown by the light blue column in the chart, has given by far the best return, an average annual return of about 20%, while the average annual return of the Russell 1000 index during the same period was about 3.5% (the red column at the left part of the chart). Also, the second and the third group (scored: 90-95 and 85-90) have given superior returns. This brings me to the conclusion that the ranking system is very useful. After running the "All-Stars: Piotroski" ranking system on all the 150 Russell 1000 tech stocks on October 18, I discovered the twenty best tech stocks, which are shown in the chart below. In this article, I will focus on the second stock of the list; Jabil Circuit (NYSE: JBL ). On September 24, Jabil Circuit reported its fourth quarter fiscal 2015 financial results that were better than analyst estimates and issued guidance for the current quarter well ahead of consensus estimates. As a consequence, JBL stock surged 12.2% on the next trading day. Year-to-date, JBL stock is up 5.6% while the S&P 500 index has decreased 1.3%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index has risen 3.2%. However, since the beginning of 2012, JBL has gained only 17.3%. In this period, the S&P 500 Index has increased 61.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index has risen 87.6%. According to TipRanks , the average target price of the top analysts is at $24, up 4.1% from its October 16 close price. However, considering JBL's compelling valuation and high growth prospects, shares could go much higher, In my opinion. Jabil reported for the quarter earnings per share of $0.53, which beat EPS expectations by $0.08 (17.8%). The company posted revenue of $4.68 billion in the period, well above analysts' estimates of $4.55 billion. Jabil showed significant earnings per share surprise in three of its last four quarters, as shown in the table below. I am extremely pleased with our fiscal 2015 results and in particular the financial strength demonstrated as we exited the year. We exceeded nearly every financial target provided at the outset of the year, culminating with core earnings per share of $2.07 and free cash flow of approximately $300 million. Our strong cash generation provided us the financial flexibility to complete a number of strategic acquisitions, aggressively re-invest in the business and return approximately $150 million to shareholders via dividend and share repurchases. Jabil also offered a strong first quarter fiscal 2016 and full year guidance. For the current quarter, the company sees revenue of $5.1 billion to $5.3 billion, and EPS of 72 cents to 88 cents. That is well ahead of consensus for $4.94 billion and 59 cents. For the full year, the company sees revenue of approximately $20 billion and EPS of $2.60. That compares to consensus for $19.3 billion and $2.37. I see high growth prospects for the company. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is Jabil's largest customers; Jabil makes iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus casings. Apple accounted for 24% of Jabil's fiscal 2015 revenues, up from 18% in fiscal 2014, which helped drive upside in Jabil's Diversified Manufacturing Services. The segment revenue of $7.1 billion in fiscal 2015 showed an increase of 39% year-over-year. The continued big success of Apple's iPhones should continue to drive the segment growth. Some investors are concerned the company is too dependent on Apple. However, in my opinion, this concern is exaggerated. Although Apple can be a difficult customer, there is no reason for Apple to cut its relationship with Jabil. The fact that Jabil is expanding a facility in China mostly for Apple production demonstrates that the company is quite confident about its future relationship with Apple. Regarding its valuation metrics, JBL stock is considerably undervalued. The forward P/E is very low at 8.24, and the price-to-sales ratio is extremely low at 0.25. Furthermore, the Enterprise Value/EBITDA ratio is extremely low at 4.69; the fourth lowest among all 150 Russell 1000 tech stocks. According to James P. O'Shaughnessy, the Enterprise Value/EBITDA ratio is the best-performing single value factor. In his impressive book, "What Works on Wall Street," Mr. O'Shaughnessy demonstrates that 46 years of backtesting, from 1963 to 2009, has shown that companies with the lowest EV/EBITDA ratio have given the best return. Also, the PEG ratio is exceptionally low at 0.69; the sixth lowest among all 150 Russell 1000 tech stocks. The PEG ratio - price/earnings to growth ratio - is a widely used indicator of a stock's potential value. It is favored by many investors over the P/E ratio because it also accounts for growth. A lower PEG means that the stock is more undervalued. The company is paying a dividend. The forward annual dividend yield is at 1.39%, and the payout ratio is only 15.2%. Jabil delivered earnings for its fourth quarter fiscal 2015 that were much better than analyst estimates and issued guidance for the current quarter well above consensus estimates. The company showed significant earnings per share surprise in three of its last four quarters. I see high growth prospects for the company. Jabil will continue to benefit from its relationship with Apple, Jabil's largest customers. Regarding its valuation metrics, JBL stock is considerably undervalued, its EV/EBITDA ratio is extremely low at 4.69; the fourth lowest among all 150 Russell 1000 tech stocks. All these factors bring me to the conclusion that JBL stock is an excellent investment opportunity right now. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
