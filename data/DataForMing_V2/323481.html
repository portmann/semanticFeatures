Apple gains time to respond to iPhone hack order - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Feb 19 2016, 04:30 ET | About: Apple Inc. (AAPL) | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has been given more time to respond to a government order to assist the FBI in unlocking an iPhone used by the perpetrators of last year's terror attacks in San Bernardino. Apple will likely seek to invoke the United States' protections of free speech as one of its key legal arguments, lawyers with expertise in the subject said this week. I really hope Apple will be able to hold it's positions. If they won't, it might become a precedent for some really dirty court's desicions. The U.S. is a peculiar place.  The fervent defence of civil liberties when it comes to gun control contrasts sharply with public opinion on this issue. Guys calm down. You only have to worry about government encroachment on your civil liberties if you're a terrorist, or a subversive, or an enemy combatant, or an extremist. It's not like they'll start labeling people that just to do what they want. You guys act like they kill American citizens with drone strikes without due process or catalog all your digital movements in giant data centers or something. I was just looking into privacy laws in the PRC. Did you know China has a right to privacy in its constitution? America's doesn't.. But at least Scalia's dead now, so at least we have that going for us. ;-) ETF Screener: Search and filter by asset class, strategy, theme, performance, yield, and much more ETF Performance: View ETF performance across key asset classes and investing themes
