Disney's D23 Expo Provided Enough Highlights To Get Investors Excited Again - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Disney shares down 17% in last month after third quarter earnings and fears of media segment weakness. D23 showed off company's upcoming strong movie slate and also announced theme park expansions. All other business segments are showing great growth and the strong movie lineup should translate well across the board. Shares of Disney (NYSE: DIS ) were hit after third quarter earnings. Shares have fallen around 17% in less than a month. The large media company held its biennial D23 Expo to show off what's in store for its movies, theme parks, and video games going into the future. My write-up from the 2013 event mentioned how Star Wars was not a big part of the announcements. My recent Time Warner write-up from Comic Con mentioned how Disney didn't bring its Marvel brand there for the first time in a while. Both of these key Disney pieces were brought together at D23 in a showcase of what's in store for Disney in the next several years. Investors should be more than pleased with the items discussed and should soon see shares reverse their down course. Information for this article taken from D23 recaps available from LicenseMag and Comicbook.com . Perhaps the biggest piece of news for Disney fans and its shareholders was the expansion of the theme parks. The company will undergo its largest expansion project in history with the unveiling of a Star Wars themed land at Disneyland (California) and Hollywood Studios (Disney World - Florida). Disney will also add a Toy Story themed area at Hollywood Studios. While the addition of a Star Wars theme park has fanboys going crazy in anticipation, it should be equally exciting to investors. For the next several years, fans will discuss possible layouts and attractions for the theme park. What is known is the park area will feature employees as Star Wars characters and locals. The park will include a customized Millenium Falcon ride, which is sure to be a hit. For Disney, this is a great use of the Star Wars property for two big reasons. First of all, this move to open the Star Wars area at Hollywood Studios should help boost that park, which has been the lowest attended of the four parks that make up Disney World. The move is also important to showcase the Star Wars brand in its full theme park effect, since Disney cannot utilize the Marvel brand at its parks. For those unaware, Universal Studios (Disney's rival) holds the theme park rights to all the major Marvel characters east of the Mississippi River. This means Disney cannot use one of its biggest brands at its most attended theme park. The key of adding the Star Wars and Toy Story expansions at Hollywood Studios could be a direct move to take on Universal Studios. Ever since the Harry Potter expansion happened at Universal Studios, that park has been seeing double digit growth annually. In 2014 , Universal Studios increased attendance by 17% to $8.26 million. This followed up a 2013 year that also saw double digit growth in attendance. Universal is also getting a bigger share of the Orlando market, one of the biggest in the country (72.6 million visitors) and home to Disney, Universal, and a Sea World. In 2014, Disney's share of this market dropped to 70.9% from 73%. Universal grew its share to 22.6% and Sea World had a 6.5% share. Plans were also shown off for the Avatar theme park expansion at Animal Kingdom. This is the third highest attended of the four parks that make up Disney World. In 2014, this park saw 10.40 million visitors. Disney has long been a giant at the box office race. The company did suffer a period of time where it was ranked fourth or fifth annually in market share. Since its acquisition of Marvel, the company has steadily gained ground in climbing to be the number two domestic company and is on track to once again be ranked second in 2015. The good news is this practice seems to be paying off in the battle of the box office . Take a look at the past few years: The big highlight was the first trailer for "Captain America: Civil War". This movie is going to be an absolute beast for Disney and I believe offers upside that is not being factored in. Unlike the last two Captain America movies, this one will serve closer to an Avengers style with appearances by several Marvel characters, including Iron Man and Spider Man. I know I have written this before in the past, but can't stress enough how big I think "Captain America: Civil War" could be. The movie acts not only as a third film in the Captain America series, but also as an Avengers 2.5 with much of the same cast and a plethora of superheroes on screen again. Take a look at these box office comparisons: Obviously, the Avengers movies are some of the highest grossing of all time. I use them as comparisons to the Captain America movies to show where a movie falling in the middle could land. Also look at the jump Iron Man 3 saw in terms of foreign box office revenue and overall box office. Captain America 2 fell below Iron Man 2 in terms of domestic take, but actually outperformed the movie with foreign and overall revenue. Want a prediction on what Captain America 3 will gross? Moviepilot.com says the movie could gross somewhere between $820 and $880 million. On Hollywood Stock Exchange, users suggest a $108 million opening. I think when taking everything into consideration, "Civil War" should end up with something close to $375 million domestic, $575 million foreign, or a total box office take of $950 million. There is some strong competition coming for the movie four to five weeks after its open, so it will depend on those first few weeks and how strong word of mouth is, of course. Disney has always been associated with animated movies. The company has released hit after hit and for the most part broken records with its animated movies coming from both its Pixar and Disney Animation studios. The year 2014 marked the first time Disney's Pixar studio didn't release a movie since 2005. In 2015, Pixar will release two movies for the first time in company history. This includes the already released "Inside Out" and November's upcoming "The Good Dinosaur". "Inside Out" grossed $340.76 million domestically and more than $677 million worldwide. "The Good Dinosaur" was one of several animated movies shown off by Disney that highlights the upcoming slate of films. Along with the announced plans for a Toy Story theme park area, the company confirmed details of a "Toy Story 4" movie. The movie will be a love story and rescue mission, focusing on Woody and Bo Peep. Keep in mind that Toy Story 3 grossed $415 million in the U.S. and more than $1.06 billion worldwide. The movie's $110 million open trails only "Frozen", another Disney juggernaut. Sequels are going to continue to be a focus for Disney with plans for "Cars 3" and "Incredibles 2". Both of those movies had poster artwork shown off at D23 and now have buzz surrounding them. Disney is also working on sequels for Frozen and Wreck it Ralph. One of the seldom talked about movies in Disney's slate is "Zootopia", which I think could be a surprise. The movie is coming from the directors of "Tangled" and "Wreck it Ralph". The movie is a buddy cop film set in the lives of animals. Characters from "Zootopia" and "The Good Dinosaur" will also get an early boost with their inclusion in Disney Infinity 3.0 (more below). A big highlight for Disney at D23 was "Moana", a 2016 animated release which features the voice of Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson. This movie is brought to you by directors of movies like "Little Mermaid", "Aladdin", and "The Princess and the Frog". The movie takes place in the South Pacific more than 2000 years ago. Moana is the company's first Polynesian princess and is already becoming a popular licensing target, a trend I believe will continue. The lowest performing Disney business unit is its interactive segment. This has been this way for some time and after seeing a slight recovery, the unit is once again underperforming. The good news is some upcoming games could once again put the spotlight and a possible turnaround on Disney Interactive. Disney spent a lot of time during its video game day of D23 discussing Disney Infinity 3.0 . Disney Infinity is a popular interactive video game that uses figures as playable characters. The new game already has many of its characters, figures, and accessories announced. Disney Infinity saw weaker sales in the last quarter. The bad news is there is some competition coming in the fall. Activision's (NASDAQ: ATVI ) popular Skylanders franchise will release its newest version in September and a new entrant in the market will come in the form of Lego Dimensions, a partnership between Lego and Time Warner (NYSE: TWX ). Disney Infinity 3.0 will get the jump on the rivals with a release the end of August. This not only gives it first entry in the crowded 2015 holiday season, but also plenty of time to release additional characters and expansion packs. The good news for Disney here is Star Wars. The focus on making Disney Infinity 3.0 Star Wars heavy is a wise one and likely what will lead Disney Infinity to the top of the pack this upcoming holiday season. In fact, characters from old Star Wars movies, new Star Wars movies, and Star Wars television shows will all make an appearance in this version of Infinity. The game will also feature characters with light sabers that light up when placed on the Infinity base. John Boyega and Daisy Ridley, stars of the upcoming "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" will voice their characters in the game as well. Disney handed off some of its Star Wars characters to Electronic Arts (NASDAQ: EA ), a studio that has helped with other Star Wars games in the past. The studio is making the highly anticipated "Star Wars Battlefront" game set for a November 17 release. Back in May , EA said it expects to sell 9 to 10 million copies of the game before the end of the fiscal year (March 31 2016). EA will pay a royalty to Disney, which should provide a nice boost to the Interactive segment in the third and fourth quarters. Shares of Disney took a hit after the announcement of its third quarter earnings . Here is a look at third quarter and nine month revenue by segment: Just when things couldn't get worse for Disney, the shares have gotten blasted with the overall market selloff and a particular bearish outlook on media stocks. The big worry and risk here is affiliate fees and cord cutting. With Disney's ESPN segment being the highest priced channel on most cable plans, Disney continues to be at risk with a shifting market. If you look at the charts above, it's easy to see why the concern for the media segment has some bears coming out of the woodwork and also why some people have taken profits with their Disney stock. The company's media networks segment is its largest revenue generator (45% first nine months) and also made up more than half of operating income (54%). The key takeaway here is the impressive growth of operating income in the other segments and also the future growth coming. D23 is an event to celebrate what's coming for Disney for both fans and investors. The focus of this year's event was upcoming movies and theme parks. Television took a back seat for the time being. It is my belief that the gains seen by the parks, studio, consumer products, and even possibly the interactive will be more important for the long haul. The company's lineup is incredibly strong and the segments are all thriving. Examples of margins being boosted in the future include guaranteed royalties from Hasbro (NASDAQ: HAS ) for Marvel and Star Wars toys, and Disney getting a higher box office revenue take from movie theatres by demanding higher prices for its high demand blockbuster movies. The selloff has also put shares in a nice position in terms of valuation. Over the last 5 years , the average price to earnings ratio for Disney is 18.7. With shares below $99, Disney is now trading at 19.5 times this year's expected earnings, and 17.7 times the $5.59 expected per share in fiscal 2016. I believe those estimates are still fairly conservative, meaning shares could be trading right at the average this year and below the average for next year. Keep in mind that shares have traded for as much as 25 times earnings several times in the last two years, suggesting a higher price to earnings ratio could once again soon follow shares. There is no doubt that the competitive atmosphere for television and affiliate fees is changing. While this will play an important role for Disney in the future, there is too much growth and catalysts elsewhere to cause this big of a selloff for investors. This may be one of the last good times to buy Disney shares under $100. D23 happens only every two years and this year's not only laid out plans for 2015 and 2016, but also set the table for the next five years and a huge boost to several business segments. The movie segment really powers the whole company as it affects more of the business segments. A strong lineup of films normally translates well to theme park attractions, consumer products, and video games. The company is betting big on its Marvel and Star Wars franchises, as it should, and also trying to release more movies from Pixar and its own Disney Animation Studios. This is a great strategy by the company to focus more on blockbusters and less on smaller family friendly films. However, as movies like "The Lone Ranger" show, one bad blockbuster can also severely hurt results. Upcoming catalysts that could push shares higher are fourth quarter earnings (November), the release of "The Good Dinosaur" (November), the release of "The Force Awakens" (December), and the announcement of a release date for "Frozen 2" (to be determined). With all business segments growing and ownership of brands like Pixar, Star Wars, and Marvel, Disney shares are on sale right now.
