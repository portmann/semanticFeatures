Boeing delivers 762 jetliners in 2015, topping forecast | Reuters A Boeing 737 MAX sits outside the hangar during a media tour of the Boeing 737 MAX at the Boeing plant in Renton, Washington December 8, 2015. Reuters/Matt Mills McKnight - RTX1XRTU NEW YORK Boeing Co (BA.N) said on Thursday that it delivered 762 jetliners in 2015, exceeding its target of 755 to 760 planes. The tally, which includes delivery of 34 of Boeing's flagship 787 Dreamliners in the fourth quarter, probably cements the company's position as the world's biggest plane maker, topping rival Airbus Group (AIR.PA) for the fourth straight year. Airbus is expected to say at its annual press conference on Tuesday that in 2015 it delivered slightly more than the 629 jetliners it delivered in 2014. Boeing delivered 120 of its 737s in the fourth quarter, slightly below the target production rate of 42 a month. But Dreamliner output suggested it was producing its latest, high-tech aircraft at a faster rate than the target of 10 a month. Boeing is planning to increase the rate to 12 a month this year. Boeing shares were down 2.4 percent at $135.51 in midday New York Stock Exchange trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was down 1.2 percent.
