Walt Disney's 'Age Of Ultron' Marvel Film Grosses Over $1.3 Billion, Strong Sign For Q3 Earnings - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha The Avengers: Age of Ultron has grossed over $1.3 billion and set a record for the highest first weekend box office revenues. The majority of international revenues were from China- close to $240 million. Universal Studios' Jurassic World has just taken the first weekend box office record from Walt Disney. The Avengers: Age of Ultron has put some serious numbers on the board for Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS ). Since its release and record setting first weekend of box office revenues, the Marvel super hero film has grossed over $1.3 billion. Talk about billion dollar brands. The three film production companies that Walt Disney has brought together are really boosting the operating income of the Magical Kingdom's studio entertainment segment. This time, Marvel was the driver with another instalment of The Avengers, which has sprung from the success of the three Iron Man movies and expanded along with the two Captain America films (The First Avenger and The Winter Soldier). Investors should be able to see in the Q3 earnings release how Age of Ultron has affected the studio entertainment segment, as well as the consumer products segment that oversees toys, games and other Avengers-branded goods sold. In Q2 2015, studio entertainment was down 6% in quarterly revenues because no big hits were being shown, and comparable quarterly revenues against the year-ago period were going to be hard since the phenomenally successful Frozen was out at that time. Looking at the breakdown of gross revenues for Age of Ultron, the international box office was more than double the US domestic market ($910 million vs $445 million). The majority of those international revenues, almost $240 million, came from China. That bodes well for consumer products in China between now and Christmas, as a number of anticipated films are slated to be released. Walt Disney's competitor Universal Studios, which is owned by Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) (NASDAQ: CMCSK ), is still ahead in China revenues with its Furious 7 film raking in more than $390 million. Next, Jurassic World, another Universal film, has just surpassed the Age of Ultron first weekend box office record of $207 million with over $208 million. The sequel to the 23- year-old Jurassic Park shows the story still has teeth. Films are not always a zero-sum revenue game. With DVDs, downloads and consumer goods, both companies can be winners. Even among Disney films, not all of them are guaranteed to be big hits. In the vein of The Lone Ranger, Tomorrowland looks like it could lose as much as $140 million once its global release is complete. Costs up to now are $180 million in production and possibly more than $150 million in marketing. In its first weekend, the long Memorial Day weekend, it grossed only $42.7 million. The Hollywood Reporter website said it may not gross much more than $200 million overall, which would just cover the production. The film was based on the concept of Disneyland's Tomorrowland attraction, which I don't think resonated as well as The Pirates of the Caribbean films, of which successful sequels are still being made. I also don't think the story was communicated in the trailers and upcoming promotions well enough to generate a lot of interest. This film's results is another reason to look at the next quarterly results closely to see its impact on the Studio Entertainment segment. Investors are just as curious as moviegoers are about the remaining films coming out this year. They're supporting the stock at around the $110 mark. It did hit a new high of $113.30 on May 5, yet since then has gone sideways. In early May I wrote the stock valuation was becoming stretched. I didn't have any doubts that Walt Disney would have a killer line-up of hit movies, and several of the biggest ones haven't even come out yet. I thought buying Walt Disney might be a crowded trade. I also expressed concerns about the operating income of the Media Networks segment, which is in charge of the TV shows, broadcasting and sports channels like ESPN. Revenues were growing at a solid pace in Q1 and Q2, yet operating income growth was 3% and -2%. Effectively over the six-month period, operating income was flat, and this is the segment that generates around 60% of total segment operating income. Investors should examine Q3 2015 earnings results to find out which way this important segment is trending towards. Consumer products and interactive are up strongly percentage-wise, but not as big in earnings as Media Networks nor Studio Entertainment. I'm glad the films are grossing big numbers. I anticipate Ant-man, Inside Out and most significantly Star Wars 7 will bring in healthy earnings this year. The stock is trading at 21 times fiscal 2015 forecast EPS. For a company that has regularly raised annual EPS 20%-25% in recent years and diluted EPS over the past six months are up about 18%, that looks reasonable. Still, analysts forecast EPS growth to moderate towards the low double digits in the outlier years, and that's what makes me cautious. I like the company, products and the stock story, but if the price has much of the market expectation baked in, that makes me want to hold and see if the stock comes off the boil. If the stock revisits $100 a share, adding to a position could make sense.
