Amid mobile headwinds, MoffettNathanson downgrades Verizon, AT&T - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha Apr  1 2016, 19:12 ET | About: Verizon Communications (VZ) | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) and AT&T (NYSE: T ) have done very well in the face of several challenging months in the mobile market -- which is why MoffettNathanson is downgrading both stocks . The firm reduced its rating on Verizon to Neutral from a previous Buy, and on AT&T to Sell from Neutral. "In the early part of the year, Verizon and AT&T rose sharply even as the market sold off," analysts said, and the past six months have seem "an almost pitch-perfect backdrop" for telecoms with a strong dollar, falling rates and falling risk appetites. Over the past six months, Verizon has appreciated 25.7% and AT&T has gained 20%; over the same period, the S&P 500 is up 7.8%. But device sales are slowing overall, and changes to equipment installment plans and leasing are resulting in stabilizing ARPUs, making the higher ratings unsupportable, the firm says. Verizon looks more promising than AT&T as its subscriber base has held up without aggressive price cutting, and mobile video strategy is going well, while at AT&T, "real growth metrics are much weaker than they appear on the surface." $60??  That would put a market cap of almost 400 billion and a P/E of almost 30..  Hmm.  Do u simply throw out numbers with absolutely no basis to them??  Or do you simply have no idea what you are talking about? When quantifying a stock price at some future date, it is not necessarily  necessary to have a  bunch of textbook defined stats that go towards "proving" the logic of the forecast. Some if any is quite alright; however visceral and intuitive logic backed by personal experience is the equal of the data to which you refer. Yogi Berra found out that the future is a hell of a thing with which to deal. In this context  anything with everything is a proof on which a stock picking decision can be made, with odds not worse than the formulations referenced. Mathematics and an IQ of 140+ may or may not improve on these odds. I can see a hold, but the only scenario in which a sell makes sense to me for T is a strong bull market and a significant rise in interest rates. O please the only people who have any regard for him is his peers that play the same steal from your grandma game....DO WE CHEATUM AND HOW EQUITIES.  Ya he is wonderful lol Good question Oregon,   Fidelity has 26 research firms opinions.  1 sell,  GMI,  10 Neutrals,  and the other 15 buy and outperform.   Moffett is not on the list.   I haven't heard of them either. It seems MoffettNathanson may be premature on the T downgrade to sell but accurate on the VZ downgrade to hold. I am long on both stocks in my retirement portfolio and holding on both stocks. VZ has traded in tight range the past several years and will continue to do so IMO. T has done the same thing until the last couple of months when share price increased dramatically. Which begs the question is T's management making all the right moves or are fearful investors starting to seek shelter from an impending pullback or recession. IMO it is both. Buy and hold two great companies with products in demand. Like so many other investors it they dip and there is dry powder, target is acquired and trigger finger is ready. Looked out the back windows today and saw an AT&T guy in my backyard.  Turns out they are running fiber in my neighborhood for a new 1GB Internet service.  They are supposed to start a streaming video service later this year. I like having my money in a company that is trying to grow.  The fact that they pay a healthy dividend certainly doesn't hurt. Erricson is in testing phase of 5G devices as well. So even if they are lower they will jump again with the release of 5G. I hear a lot of buy and hold. Who here is buying at $39? Other people yes, mutual funds yes. I would hold also if my basis was below 35, which it is so I hold and sell puts at 3-5% below the share price. Safer than covered calls recently but maybe not much longer. Sell in May? As a package customer of T, I have been offered a lot of deals lately when I balked at the price increases after my original 2 year discounted service ended. Anyone else? Lmfao!!!! Moffet the profit ( not!!) is the worst weatherman there is. He needs to stick his head out the window to see if it's raining or sunny out he has no idea what he is doing. All he does is talk his book!!! What a joke he is horrible and I would not listen to a single thing he says ....... Their DTV analysis is unconvincing.  Televised sports is huge especially NFL.  To sway me explain how buying DTV does not add revenue.  My DTV bill keeps going up. I would be curious to know why Moffet issued the downgrade so close to the upcoming T ex-dividend date (April 6). We had also had a recent underperform downgrade by a Bank of America analyst with another high yielding dividend favorite, Lexington Realty Trust (LXP), with the announcement coming out right on the ex-dividend date. Is the timing of such announcements aimed at protecting long-term investors or helping short-term traders? I am not implying anything by asking this. I am new to investing and just curious if others with experience in investing know if it is typical of analyst downgradings for them to be announced right around ex-dividend dates or if this is merely an end of quarter evaluation function, with the ex-dividend dates never being factored into a rating change. Just curious. That's pretty observant for someone who is "new to investing". You need to do your own homework on the stuff you own, ignore nitwits like these. Good hunting.
