Has Apple Started The Mac's Decline? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Tim Cook made some interesting PC comments. On Wednesday, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) will finally make its larger screen tablet, the iPad Pro, available for sale . While the hope is that the Pro will turn around sales of the struggling tablet line, it also might provide some competition to Apple's Mac. Recently, Tim Cook questioned the future of the PC, so investors might want to wonder if the Mac's best days have already come. Recently, in an interview with the Telegraph, Apple CEO Tim Cook made some interesting statements regarding the PC: I think if you're looking at a PC, why would you buy a PC anymore? No really, why would you buy one? Yes, the iPad Pro is a replacement for a notebook or a desktop for many, many people. They will start using it and conclude they no longer need to use anything else, other than their phones. Cook is naturally trying to pump up the iPad Pro, which Apple has reportedly been very conservative about initial sales . When the company launched its larger screen phones, the expectation was that sales of the iPad mini would be hurt. This seemed like a good trade-off, however, given the phone's selling price was much higher and the iPhone is a higher margin product. In the case of the iPad Pro, you have to wonder if the opposite reaction will occur. The Mac can have selling prices in the thousands of dollars, meaning the iPad Pro would be a trade down for the firm. Initially, there also is likely to be a margin hit, as Apple always sees lower margins with new products until production ramps up and supply issues are resolved. In Apple's most recently reported quarter, the Mac line showed 3.42% unit sales growth over the prior year period. This quarterly result was a new unit sales record for the Mac, with over 5.7 million sold. However, as seen in the chart below, this was the slowest year over year unit sales increase in two years. Source: Apple financial information page The Mac has been gaining market share while the overall PC market is contracting. However, growth has slowed as tough prior year comparisons kick in and the stronger dollar hurts the situation overseas. As seen in the chart below, IDC is forecasting the PC industry to contract further next year, with stabilization not happening until 2017. IDC sees total PC shipments for 2019 just barely above those seen this year, so there isn't a lot of room for growth in this space. While Apple may hurt Mac sales with the launch of the iPad Pro, the company also is seeing some new competition from Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), which has unveiled the Surface Book . Microsoft touts the 13.5 inch touchscreen laptop/MacBook Pro rival as the "ounce for ounce fastest 13 inch laptop ever made". The Surface Book is available this holiday season, and Apple could ship approximately 2 million iPad Pros in the calendar fourth quarter. As a result, I would not be surprised if Apple reports a year over year decline in Mac unit sales at some point during its fiscal 2016 (ending September 2016) period, perhaps even in fiscal Q1. With tough comparison periods and a continuing rally in the dollar, we may have seen the peak of the Mac for now. I don't think a declining Mac is a reason for investors to dump Apple shares currently, but the situation is worth watching. The company does need to find a solid number two product to back up the iPhone, and I recently detailed how the iPad could do that with an upgrade program . While Apple could continue to make small market share gains, the Mac's upside seems a bit limited given extra competition, a declining PC industry, and the rise of more tablets like the iPad Pro. Unfortunately, this seems to be a case where cannibalization among Apple products might result in a small revenue and earnings decline overall between the Mac and iPad lines. I would only become cautious on Apple if we start to see analyst estimates rise too much. While the company has some new products this quarter like the Watch and Music, the iPad will probably show another year over year decline and I detailed today how the Mac may show some weakness. At the moment, analysts are calling for $77.32 billion in fiscal Q1 revenues, which is near the top end of the company's guidance range . For now, I still think Apple could beat, giving shares room for upside to their all-time highs, but I would get worried if analysts end up expecting closer to $80 billion in revenues for the current quarter.
