Citigroup: Altice's next move may be $34B in Verizon wirelines - ALTICE S A ADR (OTCMKTS:ATCEY) | Seeking Alpha To screen ETFs by asset class, performance, yield and more, check out the ETF Hub. ETF Hub Jun  3 2015, 13:01 ET | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor With an acquisition deal for Suddenlink in the rear-view mirror, France's Altice ( OTC:ATCEY ) might have its eye on a much bigger move into the U.S.: a purchase of Verizon's (NYSE: VZ ) residential wireline business , including FiOS TV/Internet. That's according to Citigroup's Michael Rollins in his latest report. "While press reports suggests many in the market believe Cablevision is Altice's next acquisition, we believe an acquisition of Verizon's local wireline operation (excluding the enterprise and smaller strategic business units) is more likely," Rollins writes. Verizon sold local wireline operations in three states to Frontier Communications earlier this year. Verizon's remaining assets in that business could bring $34B, Rollins estimates. Altice, owner of Numericable and SFR in France, has aimed to merge those TV and wireless firms with Bouygues Telecom ( OTCPK:BOUYY ), to bring France's wireless market down to three major firms, but Bouygues has said nothing's in the pipeline . "A sale of Verizon's remaining (local) operations could accelerate the reduction in financial leverage without meaningful dilution to free cash flow per share," Rollins says. "Such a move would also increase flexibility for Verizon to more aggressively pursue spectrum purchases and further scale for its emerging wireless, over-the-top video strategy."
