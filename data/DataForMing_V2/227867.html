Learn From History: Pay Attention To Apple's Crystal Ball - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Read between the lines of Apple's guidance. Trends and history provide substance for interpreting data. Last week, the circus otherwise known as Apple, Inc.'s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) quarterly earnings announcement took place. The data points released will most certainly tend to disprove last quarter's guidance. As most people know, Apple has consistently come through with earnings that surpass guidance. Twenty-six out of twenty-eight quarters consistent. This extreme consistency offers the opportunity to develop a more refined projection for the next quarter's earnings per share. In this article I will walk through the Apple guidance numbers and provide this refined data finding. The interested Apple investor can then utilize this as a basis for determining stock movement direction that suits their own bullish or bearish beliefs. Each quarterly announcement and accompanying SEC filing is replete with management's guidance for the next quarter. For most of this article I will concentrate on the years of results and guidance that are easily accessed through the Apple website financial page . In addition to this source, I also accessed the earnings call transcripts found on Seeking Alpha going back as far as fiscal first quarter of 2009 to correlate findings and provide additional insight where needed. As with most press releases, the information is kept to headlines and sound bites. The data that is found in the earnings call transcripts and SEC filings provided much more detail and syntax. That said, Apple guidance has varied in its presentation over the last four years. In the four quarterly press releases for 2012, Apple's earnings guidance was pretty straightforward, giving single point projections for quarterly revenue, quarterly earnings and other pertinent data. Beginning with the guidance for Q2 of 2013, the guidance was changed to provide ranges for revenue, gross margin and operating expenses while continuing to provide single number guidance for other income and tax rate. At that time, earnings per share guidance was eliminated leaving the investor to calculate the EPS on their own. So, let's dig in and read between the lines of what they are saying. Starting with the revenue, we can take the information provided and formulate a more insightful view of Apple's guidance. Below is a chart showing the guidance and actual revenue numbers for the 11 quarters encompassing our timeframe. Numbers are in billions of dollars. I've added a column showing the difference between the actual and the low guidance number as well as a column to show the percentage of that difference. Notice that in these 11 quarters they have never missed their low guidance number. Although I'm sure they have plenty of spreadsheets to calculate this I believe in the more obvious reasoning. It's human nature. Would you want to be the manager who missed their revenue projection? Neither would I. In fact, the closest they came was 4% over the low range. I verified this over the previous 16 quarters finding that there was only one quarter that was less than 4% over the low or in some quarters a single number guidance. The average is 5.3% over this number for the 11-quarter period and an astonishing average of 15.6% over low/single guidance for the previous 16 quarters. I would use the more recent low of 4.0% over glow guidance as a better low-end range and would feel very comfortable using the 5.3% average over low guidance as the high end of the range for a more refined guidance. Moving on to gross margin percent, the chart below shows the guidance provided and the actual percent. Keeping with the worst case scenario, the two extra columns reflect the change from the low guidance and the percent difference of that change. With the exception of the very first estimate in our table, actual gross margin has always come in at least 2.4% higher than guidance. The average is 1.5% higher at 3.9% higher than low guidance. With Apple's buying power, and a maturing product line, gross margins should be getting better. As with the revenue, I would tend to go on the conservative side and run with 2.4% over the low estimate for our revised guidance number. Next, we'll move on to operating expenses. This is another case where the guidance is presented in a range. Again, the numbers in the chart are in billions of dollars. Worst case scenario with this parameter would be the high estimate, so for this chart I will compare the actual to the high estimate. While the numbers in the "Actual - High Guidance" column appear to be a very small number, the smallest differential in Q1 of 2015 of -.005 is still $5 million. For those of you who haven't had the "benefit" of working in large public companies, it has been my personal experience and observation that there are continual efforts to fine-tune budgets and projections, sometimes taking a very Dilbert-esque approach to the effort. Small private companies make the effort as well but tend to focus most of the efforts to control costs by focusing on big ticket items like CapEx and direct labor. Looking at the percentage under the high guidance, the trend here looks to me to be an effort to fine tune this guidance. (You can see the fine-tuning effort that was made leading up to Q4 of 2014 and Q1 of 2015 as the actual Op Expense numbers approached the high range of guidance.) For our purposes of refining the guidance numbers, I would go with something between the overall average of -1.72% under high-end guidance and the number for last quarter showing a -0.4% off high guidance, settling on an average of these two numbers, or -0.88% off the high guidance. The next two parts of the guidance provided by Apple management, Other Income and Tax rate, are presented as a single direct number. No ranges here. This chart for other income is in millions of dollars. As we see in the chart above, this has been way off in either direction most of the time. Sticking with the average would probably work best for this parameter. While there are some anomalies in this chart, with nine of the 11 quarters below the average change of 0.09%, I would take this parameter as supplied by Apple in any calculations. That leaves one other important factor before we can utilize our new "interpreted" data: share count. With only $143 billion of the $200 billion set aside for Apple's capital return program already used up, some decline in the share count can be expected to continue. Additionally, Apple has continued to purchase shares on the open market and retiring these shares as well. The chart below shows the actual share counts and percent decline for the corresponding quarters. (The share counts reflect an adjustment for the 7 for 1 stock split recorded in Q3 of 2014.) With Apple's massive cash pile available to provide additional financial engineering at any time and another $57 still committed to the capital return program, using the average decline in share count for our refined calculations should provide a fairly accurate future number. Now that we have our insight completed, let's apply the findings to previous guidance to see how far off the mark we would be in determining earnings per share. The numbers we will be "refining" are the combined guidance numbers from Apple earnings releases and calls are shown in the chart below. Apple's guidance numbers above yield the EPS in the chart below when utilizing the ending share count from the previous quarter (pre-split data is in italics). Now we'll add in the results using our revised findings. Summarizing the changes in our findings: For Revenue - Low End of Range - Add 4.0% to the low range of guidance For Revenue - High End of Range - Add 5.3% to the low range of guidance For Gross margin percent - Add 2.4% to the low range of guidance For Operating Expenses - Subtract 0.88% from the high range of guidance What we find, using the high end of guidance and our findings, is that our new calculations are 21% better than utilizing the straight guidance numbers. Even still, the average miss with our findings is 7.7% lower than actual. Surprise! The continuous financial engineering going on at Apple will continue to surprise the market. So let's add one more factor into our findings. The surprise factor. As I stated in the beginning of this article, Apple has consistently come through with earnings that surpass their guidance, no matter whether it was a straight EPS number provided directly as guidance or if it was derived from a calculation from the data provided. For 26 out of 28 quarters they have exceeded their guidance - a 92.8% consistency. (For those of you who are playing at home, the lone quarters where EPS fell within guidance was Q2 and Q3 of 2013). Let's look at an extended time frame chart. As with the other charts, quarters are Apple's fiscal quarters. The columns labeled S in the table below indicates the percentage to actual over the previous columns calculated EPS. In other words, the surprise. This is the perfect example of why we have analysts and sites like Seeking Alpha. No matter which methodology is followed, the average surprise over this 28 quarter time frame is huge by anyone's standards. No one would feel comfortable adding 19-37% to any finding as a surprise factor. A review of another table is called for in this situation. Dividing the time frame to determine trending is in order. I'll split this into four periods of seven quarters each in the table below. Avg. Surprise Using Provided High End Guidance There's obviously been some significant changes to the forecast methodologies to improve guidance numbers this well. Someone has been watching closely. For our revised findings methods, I would choose a number averaging the last two periods together, 7.25%. So where does all this put us for next quarter? Apple has provided the following guidance for fiscal Q1 2016. Shares at end of Q4 quarter: 5,793,069,000 Using the straight numbers puts earnings per share of $2.99 to $3.20 per share. Using our refined data findings, we get a range of $78.520 and $79.502 (billion) for revenue, gross margin at 39.936%, operating expense at $6.344 billion, other income of $381.16 million, a tax rate of 26.2% and a share count of 5,722,972,865. This puts profit at a record high between $18.74 and $19.03 billion. Using our surprise factor puts projected earnings per share for Q1 at $3.52. The trailing 12-month price/earnings ratio at the end of the September quarter was 12.47. Using this same P/E with our new projected earnings will put the stock price at $120.49, justifying the current market price this week. I fall into the camp where I believe Apple should garner something closer to the industry average TTM P/E of 18.7, yielding a price of around $180.00. In this market, Apple will have to perform additional financial engineering to pull off something like that. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
