Apple's Sane Advantages - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha High resale values for used iPhones have been pointed to as an â€œinsane advantageâ€? for Apple by helping defray the cost of new iPhone models. While high resale value indicates the inherent worth of the iPhone, it doesn't drive new iPhone sales. The key advantages that drive new iPhone sales for Apple are its mobile operating system and ecosystem, its custom-designed processors and its superior systems integration. In a recent article , SA contributor Paulo Santos highlighted the decline in what he termed an "insane advantage" for Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ): the resale value of older iPhones. He asserts that the decline in resale value constitutes a threat to future sales of iPhones. In fact, the decline in resale value following a new iPhone launch is normal and indicative of strong demand for the latest model iPhone. Demand for the iPhone 6/Plus was unprecedented in the December quarter, so a large drop in resale value of older, smaller screen iPhones was to be expected. Although Santos references several iPhone resale sites as anecdotal evidence of the sudden decline in iPhone resale value, he apparently overlooked an interesting blog post from last August on another site, Orchard, which offered this advice to prospective upgraders: Unsurprisingly, you can expect the resale value of your 5S to drop in response to how many used iPhones will flood the market. We crunched data from eBay transactions. Based on this, we expect that the resale value of your iPhone 5S will drop about 20% over the months after the iPhone 6 comes out. The blog post also showed some real data captured in the charts below showing how resale value of older iPhone models comes down after a new iPhone launch. In the first chart, the resale price history of the iPhone 4s is plotted in weeks after the launch of the iPhone 5. On the same chart, the resale price history of the iPhone 5 is plotted in weeks after the launch of the iPhone 5s. In the chart timeline, weeks after launch is weeks after the initial announcement (Apple event), with the dashed yellow line indicating when the phones actually became available. Santos observes that iPhone resale values have dropped since the advent of the iP6/+, and concludes that this represents a threat to future iPhone sales, since he presumes that iPhone resales fuel new sales by subsidizing the cost. He reasons that with a lower subsidy from used iPhone resales, new iPhone sales will suffer. The flaw in Santos' reasoning is contained within the first chart. Most of the damage done to the previous generation iPhone resale value was done in the two weeks after the announcement of the new iPhone. Although we don't have data yet on the impact of iP6, Orchard's historical data suggests that the impact has been similar. According to Santos' reasoning, the iPhone 6 should have been negatively impacted by the decline in resale values of older iPhones in the December quarter, but we know that didn't happen, and Apple sold an unprecedented 74 million iPhones. Even if we assume that this negative impact has been delayed into the March quarter, there still doesn't appear to be an impact. As I reported in my article on the Apple Watch event , it appears that Apple is on track to sell more than 50 million iPhones this quarter, a 20% y/y increase. Santos has the causal relationship between resale value and new iPhone sales exactly backwards. Rather than resale value driving sales, it is new sales that drive down older iPhone resale value. The stronger the demand for a new iPhone, the less demand there is for older models, coupled with the fact that older models become more available as existing users look to upgrade. Simple supply and demand. The iP6/+ was particularly impactful on older iPhone resale value this year because it tapped into years of pent up demand for a large screen iPhone. At the same time, older smaller screen models became even more obsolete than normal for a new iPhone release. Those who didn't take the Orchard blog's advice and unload their phones ahead of the iP6 release were going to be stuck. Santos assumes that people will be willing to buy iPhones only if they can get them almost for free, after reselling their old iPhone. He doesn't see any inherent advantage in Apple's mobile devices. Toward the end of his article, he points to the iPhone resale advantage and Apple's brand as its two most important advantages. Santos also produces a litany of assumed iPhone 6 shortcomings, from the display, to the processor, to the amount of RAM, to the camera, which he assumes disadvantage the iPhone 6 relative to competing Android devices. But all of these "disadvantages" already existed during the December quarter, when iPhone 6 was breaking sales records. If these disadvantages were so severe, why did they have so little impact? The Apple bears always have a pat answer: Apple's success is all blue smoke and mirrors, a function of the magic appeal of the Apple brand, which they assume must wane in time. Apple's advantages can never be anything of substance. Apple's mobile devices currently enjoy several key advantages which have nothing to do with resale value, but which are very much sane. The first advantage is the iOS operating system. As a developer who has worked on Windows, Mac OS and iOS, I certainly believe that iOS is superior to Android, which is why I picked it as the platform for my app development. Another key advantage of Apple's mobile devices is Apple's custom 64-bit Systems on Chip (SOCs). These have consistently outperformed other ARM chips available in the Android world, with the exception of Samsung's latest SOC used in the forthcoming Galaxy S6. The superiority of the Samsung SOC will probably end once Apple's next generation SOC (usually referred to as the A9) comes out in the next iPhone. By far, the most important, and most overlooked by Apple bears, advantage that Apple has is in systems integration. The is the ability to bring together software, hardware, design and services into a single compelling product. Those who haven't actually used Apple devices simply cannot appreciate what Apple's systems integration brings to them. But it's not blue smoke and mirrors. Apple's systems integration is the fundamental driver of its success in the mobile market place. Here, the mobile device market created an opportunity for Apple. Apple had always been keen on providing a unified, integrated experience in the Mac, but the value of this got lost in the wave of commodity Wintel PCs. In mobile devices, systems integration assumed greater importance. Mobile device users weren't going to spend time tinkering with their device or OS, weren't going to upgrade processors or disk drives. Mobile device users just wanted their devices to work as intended. As long as Apple continues to excel in the systems integration of its iPhones, the iPhone will continue to succeed in the market place. If, as I expect, Apple does sell 50+ million iPhones in the March quarter, it will set a new quarterly record, and I expect records to fall in the following quarters of the fiscal year as well.
