That’s the biggest divergence in quarterly data going back to 2000. With nine straight quarters of stock-market gains, equity valuations at a five-year high, and the Fed bracing to raise interest rates, investors may be rethinking the $240B they've pumped into U.S. stocks over the past two years. 1 comment » The ECB will focus on improved growth prospects when it meets today, and unveil some details of its €1T+ bond buying plan. The bank is expected to keep interest rates on hold and lift growth forecasts after a string of positive data surprises. But it could cut inflation projections or even flip to expecting deflation due to the effect of low oil prices. 1 comment » China lowered its growth forecast to 7% for 2015, an acknowledgement of the "new normal" of slower growth in the world's No.2 economy. Last year's target was around 7.5%; the lower number is in line with expectations. 7 comments » Mohamed El-Erian's prediction for oil in 2015: i) Expect continued consolidation, volatile at times, with a tendency toward higher oil prices. ii) There will be no quick return to the $100 level. iii) Low-cost producers of oil and energy products will expand their market share. 2 comments » Global trade in liquefied natural gas (LNG) will exceed $120B in 2015, surpassing iron ore as the most valuable commodity after oil, Goldman analysts say. Competition among producers will increase as buyers shift away from long-term contracts.

Comment » Abbvie surprised investors by acquiring cancer biotech Pharmacyclics (NASDAQ: PCYC ) with a bid of about $21B. Earlier Wednesday there were rumors J&J (NYSE: JNJ ) would acquire PCYC. With the deal, AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV ) gets blockbuster Imbruvica for hematologic malignancies, which logged $548M in revenues in 2014, and could go all the way to $5B/year, and which will allow ABBV to lessen its reliance on Humira. 18 comments » Costco reported FQ2 EPS of $1.35 on revenue of $27.45B, largely in line with estimates. Same-store sales grew 8%, beating expectations of 6.4% growth. Comment » Etsy plans to go public on the Nasdaq under the symbol ETSY . Etsy's top-line numbers suggest a valuation of well above $1B. The company had 2014 revenue of $195.6M (+56% Y/Y), and a net loss of $15.2M. In January it was reported the craft and vintage goods marketplace could seek to raise $300M. 3 comments » Apple is reportedly delaying production of the 12.9" iPad to September due to supply issues.

A standalone service from HBO (NYSE: TWX ), often a $15-$20/month add-on, could send ripples throughout the pay TV industry. For Apple, it would mean a chance to add a high-quality offering to push adoption of Apple TV. 27 comments » Simon Property Group has made overtures for rival Macerich (NYSE: MAC ) over the past few weeks, in an apparent bid to combine two of the largest U.S. shopping-mall owners. In November, Simon (NYSE: SPG ) disclosed a 3.6% stake in Macerich, seen by many as the first step in a takeover attempt. MAC shares have risen to new multi-year highs since then, and were +5.25% late last night.
