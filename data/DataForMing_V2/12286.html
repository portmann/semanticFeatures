Sports networks eye an unbundled future - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Mar 25 2015, 13:43 ET | By: Clark Schultz , SA News Editor ESPN would have to charge $36.30 per subscriber in an a la carte world to keep its margins level, according to some number-crunching from MoffettNathanson. Most analysts agree that live sports programming has the best chance at pulling in lush pricing, but not at the levels indicated by the MoffettNathanson analysis. The threat to revenue from a cable world unbundled could be one reason Disney ( DIS -1.6%) and Time Warner ( TWX -0.9%) appear to be dabbling with direct sports programming on demand .
