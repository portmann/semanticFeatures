Analysts Are Divided On Apple's Q2 Outlook - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple was a good short in 2015 as the iPhone sales outlook weakened. I have taken a lot of flak over my articles suggesting that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) was and is a good short. Notwithstanding, it has been a good short falling from $132 to $97 last year. I have argued that Apple's fortunes are inextricably tied to the iPhone and that iPhone sales are falling. Despite the controversy I see in the comments on my articles, there is growing evidence that iPhone growth is sagging. For several years, Apple's iPhone sales have lagged growth in the market but have nonetheless grown as the market itself expanded. That seems to be coming to an end. Analysts now see a sharp decline in iPhone sales on the near-term horizon as a real possibility although views are divided. Source: Pacific Crest as reported by Business Insider Apple's stock has risen recently on reports that in the March quarter iPhone sales figures may be stronger than the market expects. Well regarded Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley sees surprisingly robust sales of as many as 56.5 million units in the period. Huberty sees robust China sales as a source of the expected strength. It is hard to know who has it right in this debate, but sizzling sales of the Samsung Galaxy S7 in China suggest the market may be pretty crowded at the premium end. Samsung Galaxy S7 pre-orders reportedly top 10 million in China only a few weeks after the new device was announced. Pre-orders in China are more indications of interest than actual demand, but the scale of the pre-orders is nonetheless impressive. As I see the world, analysts tend to be lagging indicators rather than particularly good forecasters. Some analysts think Apple has been deliberately overstating the underlying trends on iPhone sales. I share that view to the extent Apple has recorded as "sales" over 20 million iPhones shipped to carriers but not yet sold to end users. At about $650 per phone, that comprises $13 billion of "sales" booked by Apple but arguably not yet earned. We are well into Apple's Q2. My view is that it is going to be a lot softer than most investors seem to think. If iPhone sales fall by 20% compared to last year, the quarter might be dismal and the full year a disappointment. I'm sticking to my forecast that Apple is on the road to full-year earnings per share in the range of $8.64 as set out below. That's well below the average analyst estimate of $9.06 as posted on Yahoo.com Finance. A miss of $0.42 per share might seem slim, but for a company like Apple evidence of declining sales and profits can be a harbinger of a rapid exit from the name, particularly if the market's reception to the expected iPhone 7 is lackluster. I have read most of the scuttlebutt about what the new iPhone might offer, and it is pretty humdrum with not much more than another round of incremental improvements to the screen (OLED, finally catching up to Samsung), to the processor (another step along the Moore's Law path, and a few tweaks to design (dropping the headphone connector and using the lightning connector instead, making a lot of existing accessories obsolete). A 9to5 Mac survey suggests that most users will not buy an iPhone 7 unless it is a substantial change from the iPhone 6. Apple investors should simply reflect on a reality that has been on the radar screen for quite a while. Smartphone markets are maturing, Apple has a very small share of that market, and the glory days of rapid growth are history. Apple will become a mature technology company that, like HP (NYSE: HPQ ), may trade at a very low multiple of earnings.
