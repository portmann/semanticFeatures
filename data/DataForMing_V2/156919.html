Why Apple Is Likely To Continue The iPad Mini - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha A bigger iPhone does not make the iPad Mini 2 obsolete. The cheaper iPad Mini helps Apple retain its crown as the top vendor of tablets. Repeat purchases from iPad & iPad Mini users make up for the lower hardware margin on cheaper iOS devices. Another esteemed author suggested that the Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPad Mini might have its last refresh this year. I agree with his assessment that the release of the iPhone 6 Plus is contributing to the uncertainty over of the future of the iPad Mini. However, I do not agree that a lower-ASP product like a $399 iPad Mini should be discontinued just because there will be a premium $700 6-inch iPhone. The issue is more than just about gross margins on hardware sales. The iPad Mini, as the more affordable version, helps Apple maintain its leading role in global tablet sales. An $800 6-inch iPhone does not negate the fact that millions of people can only afford a $399 iPad Mini. Yes, Apple makes most of its money from imposing a high-margin policy on its mobile devices. However, there is also the undeniable fact that iOS phones and tablets also serve as channels for repeat app store purchases. My simple explanation why Apple will sustain the development of new iPad Mini models is the same reason why Apple made a new iPod Touch 6th gen … The lower-ASP iPad Mini and iPod Touch products' purpose is to recruit more repeat customers for Apple's app store business. We all know that mobile games dominate the iOS app store. Apple's 30% cut from app sales/in-app purchases last month was $1.7 billion . Consequently, cheaper iOS devices like the iPad Mini 2 and iPod Touch remain essential to Apple's future because gamers (even those who can only afford $299 devices) are potential customer for repeat in-app purchases. Apple sells far more iPhones than iPads and yet, as per the Q2 Global App Data report of SensorTower , the iPad/iPad Mini users actually contribute almost half of Apple's commission from top-grossing iOS games. This compels me to believe that many big-spending gamers still prefer the bigger iPad Mini/iPad over the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. The iPad Mini's long-term importance to Apple's bottom line is clearly illustrated by the chart below. The iPad and the iPad Mini are favored devices among big-spending players of Clash of Clans, Game of War - Fire Age, Candy Crush Saga/Soda Saga. The iPad-using players of social casino games from Big Fish Casino and Double actually spend more money than their iPhone-using counterparts. (Source:SensorTower/Alcaraz Research) There is no verifiable data to determine the proportion of iPad and iPad Mini gamers. However, I speculate that a large portion of the iPad gaming community use the smaller and lighter iPad Mini. Ergonomic reasons make the smaller and lighter iPad Mini the better choice for hardcore iPad gamers. I am one of those millions of iPad gamers who use the iPad Mini 2. The future of the iPad Mini is somewhat assured because of its superior function as an affordable mobile gaming machine. The mobile games industry, of which Apple is the biggest beneficiary , is now a $30 billion/year industry where the iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad, and iPad Mini serve important roles. The cheaper iPad also helps Apple's app store get more downloads/sales from emerging markets like India and Vietnam. India delivered more than 60% Q/Q growth in revenue and downloads for the iPad. Another strong reason why I believe Apple will not discontinue the iPad Mini is that it could thrive in the enterprise market. Adding a stylus to the upcoming iPad Mini 4 makes it a serious rival to Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Surface 3 and Samsung's ( OTC:SSNLF ) Galaxy Note . Apple can market a stylus-equipped lower-ASP iPad Mini to small business enterprises. The education and government sectors are also viable markets for a budget-friendly iPad Mini that has the stylus advantage similar to that of the Surface 3 and Galaxy Note. Apple joined the bandwagon for phablets last year with the release of the iPhone 6. It is high time for Apple to also join the new bandwagon for stylus-toting tablets. Other top-selling Windows and Android tablet makers have joined the stylus/tablet bandwagon after they saw the multi-million unit sales of the Galaxy Note series. The rumor of a stylus-toting 12.9-inch iPad Pro compels me to believe that Apple will eventually sell its own stylus-enabled tablet soon. I am sure that Apple will also find it logical to also equip its lower-ASP and smaller iOS tablets with a stylus. I only hope that Apple will create a more elongated 7-inch design of the iPad Mini so corporate users with small hands can grip it more comfortably. Sticking exclusively to higher-margin iPhones and iPads might not be the best option for Apple. The iPad Mini is important to Apple's revenue stream because of its contribution to app store purchases in mature and emerging markets. The iPad Mini 2 also has the potential to compete with the Galaxy Note and Surface 3 in the enterprise market. Bulk orders of the $399 iPad Mini from corporate buyers is obviously more compelling than a single-order of a $599 iPad Air 2. Furthermore, unless Apple releases a $299-$399 six-inch iPhone with decent specs, the iPad Mini will remain relevant for many years to come. The substantial numbers of Apple's global customers that can only afford the iPad Mini (and the iPod Touch) is worthy of continuing attention. Developing and selling lower-ASP iPads also increase the total addressable market for Apple's iAd, streaming music, and upcoming video streaming businesses.
