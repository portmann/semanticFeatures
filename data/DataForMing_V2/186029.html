Here's What Americans Eat, Drink, and Spend in Real Time Here are the tools and resources that changed my financial life! YOU ARE HERE: Home » General » Here’s What Americans Eat, Drink, and Spend in Real Time and It’s Mind Blowing! I love to see numbers, but when someone shared with me how much Americans eat, drink, and spend in a real-time graphic, it blew my mind a bit. The numbers are staggering and hard to comprehend. We really do spend a lot of money, mostly on wants, not so much on needs. Â In just five minutes, we spend over $1 million just online. I can be a part of that statistic since I’m an Amazon junkie.

This shows how much we spend down to the second based on some statistics and different information sources. It’s pretty cool to see, especially when you start looking at what we buy, how much we eat, and just how much we spend in such a short amount of time. From the time we wake up to the the time we go to sleep, we are spending some money! In just 10 minutes, we put over $14 million on our credit cards, Walmart has nearly $4 million in sales, Amazon sees $400,000 in online sales, and we consume over one million gallons of gasoline. That’s in just 10 minutes! We also drink over a million cups of coffee in the same amount of time. This just shows you that we are all caffeinated spending junkies. It’s no wonder where our hard-earned money is going. We are spending it everywhere! This interactive graphic is the reason why I try to teach people to save more money , make money money , and fight debt . There are so many spending temptations out there (let alone pricing tricks ) that we have to work harder than ever to keep more of our money in our pockets (or bank accounts). I can almost guarantee that many of those people using their credit cards in the 10 minutes are not paying them off every month. Those donuts or Amazon gift cards are costing us in interest and it can hurt in the long run. Trust me, I used to have a lot of credit card debt ! Anyway, check out the interactive graphic below and just see how fast we consume. We are eating, drinking, and buying so much that it really does boggle the mind. If you’re like me, then your mind has officially been blown! I'm a business owner, blogger, father, and husband. I used credit cards too much and found myself in over $50,000 in debt. I paid it off, started this blog, and my financial life has changed. I now talk about fighting debt and growing wealth here. I run a blog management company , along with another blog. It is Empowered Shopper , which helps people get information about products they want to buy. You can also check out Eyes on the Dollar , which is a great blog that I co-own.
