Intel Three Negatives: Replacement Cycle Insights - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel recognizes that the PC replacement cycle has gone from 3 or 4 years to 5 or 6 years, but ignores that smartphones have replaced the PC for personal use. Intel recognizes that there will continue to be private and public cloud replacement/growth, but ignores that traditional enterprise servers are dying. This article will focus on three Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) replacement cycle items that will continue to negatively affect Intel stock value in the short term. These three are PCs, traditional enterprise servers and CEO. These three replacement cycle items became very clear after reading the transcript of "Intel Corporation's CEO, Brian Krzanich Presents at Sanford C Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference 2016" and more importantly listening to the actual interview . I have followed Intel closely for several years, at times investing heavily. I am currently not invested in Intel and am looking for the right opportunity. It is clear to me that such an opportunity is not right now. I will watch for opportunities later this year. In general I was very disappointed with Brian Krzanich's explanations in the Bernstein interview. One general observation: Brian Krzanich feels that Intel's future lies in replacement cycles . . . specifically new technology replacing older technology. Generally I think he is right. Brian cited several reasons for the slowing of the PC replacement cycle from 3 or 4 years to 5 or 6 years. These focused on the slowing pace of innovation and the need for more innovation in PCs to drive PC sales. He ignored and did not mention the impact that smartphones have had on PC sales. Sure we need PCs to perform work, but there are many people that used to by a PC for non-work purposes that now rely on their smartphone for internet access, email and other non-work items. To me ignoring this impact on PC sales is like sticking your head in the sand. On the other hand, as a CEO of Intel to admit such an oversight would not be good for one's career. The previous manager of PC division (Kirk Skaugen had several titles over a couple of years) was trying to address the need for more innovation by bringing to the PC wireless charging/docking, no passwords and natural interface. These three items never made it into widespread production due to technical challenges. Now the previous PC division manager is gone. I need to give some credit here. The concept of Intel replacing its own processor with a new processor does work and can be accelerated for work type PCs. A 5 or 6 year replacement cycle is more realistic. During this 5 or 6 years new work PC processors will likely have new features that make replacement compelling. Note that Intel here is competing against itself to replace its own processors. Smartphones are the replacement for many PCs that are not used for work. This fact will continue to result in a decline in PC sales that exceeds Intel's estimates (not a good thing). Enterprise is more complicated. Here Intel clearly replaces itself . . . to buy new Intel processors, clients must be convinced that the total cost of ownership including buying the new equipment will be less for the new generation of processor compared to continuing to use the existing equipment (no capital cost). This is a high bar and requires dramatic technological improvements to keep replacements moving at a pace that can achieve 15% growth year over year. Recently Intel technological advancements have been slow to get to market. This has negatively impacted Intel replacement cycles in the Data Center. There are some exciting new technologies that have been in the works for several years that when they make it to production will result in more replacements. Maybe this will be later this year and more likely in 2017 and 2018. See my previous article on Intel Slump in 2016 and Thrive in 2018 . My main negative point is that Intel is ignoring the traditional servers that used to occupy almost every office. These servers are being replaced by the cloud. Many by the public cloud and some by the private cloud. Companies are not buying new servers to replace old servers. Brian noted that most small to medium companies are moving to the public cloud because they like not having to worry about their own IT equipment. Sure gateway type equipment is still needed in offices but this is a lower level of processor than what was included in traditional servers. Ignoring the fact that traditional servers are being replaced by much more efficient public cloud processors is a huge headwind for Data Center sales. Reduced sales of traditional server processors brings down overall DCG sales even though sales of cloud processors is growing rapidly. I used to be impressed by Brian's presentations and his understanding of Intel and it's direction. Now, not so much. I see two reasons for this change. First, I know more now about Intel than I did in past years so I know when he is blowing smoke. Second, Brian is not as cohesive and sharp as he was in past years. Read the transcript and listen to the interview to come to your own conclusion. Bad day? This lack of clarity, guessing at answers and ignorance of negatives affecting Intel has been growing over the last year. If I was an Intel Board member, I'd be looking around for a new CEO as part of improving Intel through replacement cycles. Recent advancements within Intel provide a couple of choices. Dr. Venkata "Murthy" Renduchintala President of Client & Internet of Things (NYSEMKT: IOT ) Businesses & Systems Architecture Group and Executive Vice President is one option. I have yet to hear an actual public presentation by Murthy so I doubt he is ready for prime time. The other inside option is Diane M. Bryant, executive vice president and general manager of the successful Data Center Group. Diane I see as a more likely candidate for CEO of Intel. Her presentations are thorough, easy to follow and factual. Her responses to questions are cohesive, factual and easy to follow. The Greek god Apollo gave Cassandra the power of prophecy-but when she refused him, he spat into her mouth to inflict a curse that nobody would ever believe her prophecies. People that have worked closely with me for a number of years have told me that I am like Cassandra. I often have good foresight into the future but nobody will believe me. The choice is yours. A challenge is using these insights to figure out which way Intel stock will go in the future. The first two declining cycles (PC and traditional servers) will clearly be a drag on Intel earnings. This drag could be significant for the next few months and possibly decreasing over the next two years as the DCG, IoT and memory businesses grow. The impact of a change in CEO is more challenging to estimate. Maybe a change would be seen as a negative, a failure of Intel. The result could be a drop in Intel stock. Maybe the CEO replacement could be seen as a recognition of a need to change and the willingness to change and therefore be a positive for Intel stock. There will be a huge effort to make such a change a positive event for Intel so my thinking is that such an announcement will likely be positive for Intel stock price. I continue to see Intel stock price dropping to $28 or $25 over the next several months before it starts its rise to above $35 over the next couple of years.
