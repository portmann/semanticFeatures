The world No. 1 chipmaker is making its largest acquisition to reinforce its portfolio of higher-margin chips used in data centres and boost its business in household devices linked to the Internet. Altera makes programmable chips used to speed up web searches, among other uses. The proposed takeover is one of three big deals in the highly fragmented chip industry this year.
