Bloomberg: Salesforce bid for LinkedIn prior to the Microsoft deal - Salesforce.com, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) | Seeking Alpha Jun 16 2016, 18:03 ET | By: Eric Jhonsa, SA Eye on Tech , SA News Editor Salesforce (NYSE: CRM ) was bidding for LinkedIn before the professional social network agreed to a $26.2B deal with Microsoft, sources tell Bloomberg . There was already speculation Salesforce (currently has a $55.3B market cap) or another third party was vying to acquire LinkedIn, given Microsoft is paying a near-50% premium to where LinkedIn traded before the deal was announced. LinkedIn's recruiting/jobs products would've complemented Salesforce's cloud CRM apps, and its user data could've been integrated with the apps. LinkedIn's Sales Navigator social selling tool already syncs with Salesforce's apps. Last year, Salesforce was reported to have held buyout talks with Microsoft that fell apart due to disagreements over price.
