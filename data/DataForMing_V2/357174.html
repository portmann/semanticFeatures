Tactical Asset Allocation - April 2016 Update | Seeking Alpha March was good month for risk assets. Let's see if it continues in April. Here is the tactical asset allocation update for April 2016. Below are the updates for the AGG3, AGG6, and GTAA13 portfolios. The source data can be found here . These signals are valid after every trading day. So, while I maintain these month-end updates, this means that you can implement your portfolio changes on any day of the month, not just month end. FINVIZ will at times generate signals that are slightly different than Yahoo Finance. Note: I am not maintaining the Yahoo Finance versions any more. All portfolios now use FINVIZ data. This month, AGG3 has one new holding with real estate, VNQ , back in the mix. AGG6 also has MTUM and VTV as new holdings. Approximate monthly and YTD performance is below. In a new change, global asset allocation is working well in 2016. For the Antonacci dual momentum , GEM and GBM portfolios, GEM is back in SPY , and the bond portion of GBM is in MBB . I have changed the MBS tracking ETF to MBB, from VMBS , due to errors in FINVIZ. I also now compare the FINVIZ data to Yahoo Finance for the bond portion. The Antonacci tracking sheet is shareable, so you can see the portfolio details for yourself. The Bond 3 quant model , see spreadsheet , ranks the bond ETFs by 6-month return and uses the absolute 6-month return as a cash filter to be invested or not. The Bond 3 quant model is invested in IGOV , EMB , and VGLT . That's it for this month. These portfolios signals are valid for the whole month of April.
