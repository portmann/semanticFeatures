Was Apple's Guidance Really That Weak? - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple's guidance did not impress some on Wall Street. When Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) announced its fourth quarter results on Tuesday, I was generally impressed with the report. The company announced a solid revenue number ahead of estimates and strong gross margins, combined with a massive buyback fueled a sizable EPS beat. There were some on Wall Street disappointed with the company's fiscal Q1 guidance, and SA contributor Mark Hibben went as far to call it "anemic". While I agree with a lot of what Mark has to say when it comes to Apple, a further examination of current issues leads me to disagree with his opinion. Let me first point out that Mark did discuss two key issues when it came to the December period. Apple, like many multinationals, is feeling the effect of a stronger dollar, which is hurting Apple in the mid to high single digits (percentage wise) in terms of revenue growth. As Apple CEO Tim Cook pointed out on the conference call , the company is guiding to 8% to 11% revenue growth for the quarter when excluding FX. Additionally, Mark discusses the issue of China regarding the iPhone, because that key country saw the phone's launch a couple of weeks earlier this year. This likely pulled through a few million sales of the device into fiscal Q4, which probably impacted revenues by about $2 billion for the quarter. So when comparing this year to last, the guidance would have looked a lot better with $2 billion added to this year's figure, or subtracting that much from last year's. This is why Apple's opening weekend sales release was a bunch of noise, because this year's launch was much different than last year's. The second issue I have is that Apple pointed out on the conference call a couple of key issues regarding accounting items related to some of its products. The key points are detailed below: First, relative to the iPhone upgrade program that I just mentioned, we will be reducing revenue at the time of sale for the cost associated with the program and deferring the portion of revenue related to Apple care, software upgrade rights and non software services for each iPhone sold. Second, in September based on an analysis for market offerings we reduced the estimated selling price of future software upgrade rights and non software services that we defer for each iOS device and Mac sold, the reduction is between $5 and $10 per unit. Third, also in September we lengthened the time period over which the deferred revenue associated to iPads will be recognized from two years to three years. This probably shouldn't be a surprise to many, as it has already been discussed on this site back in September. CEO Tim Cook said that the impact on iPhone average selling prices will be minimal, but even a 1% hit overall on roughly 75 million iPhones would be about $500 million for the December quarter. The midpoint of Apple's guidance was for $76.5 billion, coming in below what analysts were looking for at $77.05 billion, so if you adjust for these accounting issues, I think Apple's guidance would have been right there. These deferrals should benefit some future periods a little. A third issue I have is that Apple's management has still been fairly conservative with its guidance, even though it has tried to be "more realistic" in the past couple of years. As you will see in the table below, Apple was ahead of its own range in each of the four quarters during fiscal 2015. The top end of Apple's guidance was above the analyst midpoint, so I won't be surprised in January if Apple comes in around or above $78 billion. (Source: Apple financial information page ) One final item I'd like to discuss is in regards to the iPad. Last year in the December period , Apple sold more than 21.4 million units of its tablet, comprised of the Air and Mini. This year, the company refreshed the Mini but did not refresh the Air. Apple launched the larger screen iPad Pro, which is a bit more expensive, but the company has reportedly ordered a limited amount , being conservative over early sales. I believe Apple will refresh the Air some time in the spring, but the difference over last year's period in my opinion probably relates to around $1 billion in iPad revenues for the fiscal Q1 period. In the end, I don't think Apple's guidance was as bad as some made it out to be. When you consider management's tendency to be quite conservative, a few accounting changes, and the differences against last year's period, I think guidance was rather fair. The iPhone 6s is doing well, with Apple reporting a very strong Q4. Management also put its money behind the stock with another large accelerated buyback, taking advantage in the pullback in shares during the quarter. Apple is up a couple of bucks on Wednesday morning. I think it is good for the stock that it has been able to stay above the key 50-day moving average post earnings as seen below. As this report is further digested, I think investors will be quite satisfied with the results. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
