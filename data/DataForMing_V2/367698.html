Will Amazon's Effort In Fashion World Be Successful? - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha Amazon has been making efforts to increase its footprint in the apparel segment in the hope that it would bring it higher margins. It recently started selling top brands like Lacoste, Kate Spade, Calvin Klein and others. Amazon has also launched several personal brands like Society New York women’s dresses and Franklin & Freeman men’s shoes. Future growth potential of this segment is excellent and Amazon should be able to eat into the market share of Macy’s, Wal-Mart and Target. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) is going all-in in its effort to capture a higher market share within the apparel segment. Its latest efforts have yielded good results as top brands including Calvin Klein, Lacoste, Kate Spade, Nicole Miller and others have started selling directly to Amazon. Amazon has been working on this segment for the past decade starting with the purchase of shopbop.com back in 2006. It is also trying to change its image in this segment. Due to its cut-throat pricing in other segments, Amazon was viewed as "downmarket" by many of the top brands. In its latest efforts to change this perception, it has started selling at full price within the apparel segment. The top brands have another major reason to switch to Amazon. Many department stores like Macy's Inc. (NYSE: M ) and Kohl's Corporation (NYSE: KSS ) are struggling to give good growth and are shutting many stores. On the other hand, Amazon is growing at a fast clip. Last year research firm Cowen estimated that Amazon's apparel sales will increase from $16 billion in 2015 to $52 billion surpassing Macy's as no. 1 seller by 2017. In order to increase its margin, Amazon has another unique play. It has pushed its private brands aggressively using the enormous amounts of data it has collected on shoppers' purchasing habits. The private brands of the firm include Society New York women's dresses and Franklin & Freeman men's shoes. They also launched "Style Code Live" which has celebrity guests who are highlighting some of the items available on the site. Amazon has a major ace up its sleeves when it comes to competing with other traditional stores in this segment. Besides having gargantuan amounts of data on customer preferences for size and style, Amazon also has a much more flexible and sophisticated pricing ability. Bloomberg recently mentioned that Amazon changed prices an average of 9.2 times per item whereas Macy's changed 2.1 times and Kohl's changed 1.5 times within the specific period. This shows the ability of the platform to try different price points to increase sales and maximize margins. All these efforts yielded a growth rate of 25% in the last year for Amazon. In comparison to this, Macy's Inc. fell 3.7% and Kohl's Corp. grew by a paltry 1%. Fig: Performance of Amazon's stock in comparison to Macy's and Kohl's reflects the better growth in sales shown by Amazon. Amazon's attempts to grow its apparel segment are not limited to North American market alone. It is also trying in other markets by increasing its marketing efforts. It was a major sponsor in the recently concluded Amazon India Fashion Week which showed an eclectic mix of new style and trends by some of the leading designers in the market. Amazon has suffered a number of failures in this segment but did not give up because of one reason: possibility of very high margins. Private brands can be sold at a margin as high as 80% depending on the place of manufacturing and the quality of the product. This also brings to light a very important aspect: what segments make up Amazon's total sales. Most of the investing community is fixated on the top line growth of Amazon. In the future it would be equally important to see what categories are providing the highest sales. According to a recent report by Comcast , last year the apparel segment was able to beat computer hardware online sales during the holiday shopping season. Higher percentage of sales in apparel, with a greater share of company owned private brand can bring in much needed long-term profits for the firm. The share of apparel segment in total online sales is higher within the millennial age group and points towards future shopping trends. It was clearly visible during the Cyber Week sales last year when "apparel and accessories" segment cornered close to 28% of total online sales compared to 23% for "electronics and accessories" segment. The apparel segment and the efforts put in it will be one of the biggest strengths of Amazon in the future. The ability to push its own sales by increasing the percentage mix of Amazon-owned private brands should yield higher margins. The acceptance of online retail in this segment among millennials is also encouraging and points to brighter future for online retailing.
