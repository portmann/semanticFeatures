Microsoft Is Trying: Lessons For Today's Management - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Satya Nadella and Microsoft is trying to get its focus back and present a coherent vision. The approach to Windows 10 appears to be a preview of how it is changing how it does business. Regaining focus on what it does best and concentrating on the speed of the market are two vital components of the current effort to reposition itself. James Stewart's column "Common Sense" in the New York Times reiterates some "rules" for those who hope to prosper in the world of the information network. The "rules" are not that profound, but they often become forgotten in a world that changes so rapidly, especially for those that have achieved some success in the space. Microsoft Corp. (NYSE: MSFT ) has certainly achieved success in the past. However, the company is going through a process of refocusing itself and working out a vision of what it wants to be in the future. The starting point of Mr. Stewart's article is Microsoft's recent charges relating to its acquisition of Nokia's (NYSE: NOK ) phone unit. However, the best information in his piece comes toward the end. Mr. Stewart deals with some of this "refocusing" but then later in his article he gets at some of the "rules" that Microsoft leadership needs to observe in working out their vision of the future. Satya Nadella, Microsoft's CEO, has to carry the main responsibility for the development of this vision and judging from many the writing of many other observers, he has not yet been able to consolidate his thinking into one memorable picture of where he thinks things are going. The interesting thing is that Mr. Stewart quotes a spokesman from Microsoft, Frank X. Shaw, to emphasize his points. First, there is the argument that the company must focus on the things it does well. Microsoft, over the past fifteen years, has strayed far from this advice. It was able to do so because it had its Windows platform that was the standard in the industry and Microsoft lived off of the dominant position it had established in the 1990s. Of course, for management, achieving this dominance proved to them, if not the world, that they were super smart. However, for the next ten to fifteen years, Microsoft leadership, in all it did, with all the products it got into, added little or nothing to the value of the franchise. The price of Microsoft stock basically flat lined the 2000s until Mr. Nadella became the CEO. Microsoft, it can be argued, lost its focus on the things it did well. Now, in its efforts to refocus, Mr. Nadella, in an email to employees this month, wrote "We are moving from a strategy to grow a stand-alone phone business to a strategy to grow and create a vibrant Windows ecosystem." Hence the Windows 10 released this week. The new strategy is not to create a wonderful "grand scheme" like it did in the past, but to continue to manufacture Windows phones and other products only differentiate them and make them leaders in specific markets, like for business owners. Mr. Shaw contends that "Instead of just thinking about our products running on our devices, we're thinking about how we reach people, no matter what device they're using." In the way, Mr. Shaw continues, our differentiated products will allow Microsoft to "focus on the things we do best, the products we do well." This leads to a second point. In doing what it did, Microsoft, like many other companies, tried to develop a "grand scheme" connected with its platform and failed badly. One economist that Mr. Stewart quotes, Nicholas Economides of NYU, "Mot people didn't believe that such a catastrophe could occur this fast." Early in the 1990s it was noted that companies that produced information goods had to be very nimble and come to market regularly, at a very rapid pace. Microsoft was one of the early leaders in "time pacing", introducing products or services to market based upon time rather than upon whether or not the new product or the new version of the product was a "complete and finished" entity. Time was the driver. Building a "grand scheme" with many integrated components, where "our products" were "running on our devices" was not conducive to time pacing. To Mr. Nadella and Mr. Shaw, the importance of Windows 10 is that "Microsoft recognized a pressing need to innovate." Mr. Shaw added to his comments "If you miss the first wave, you have to hang on and then drive or anticipate the next wave. We want to be part of the next wave of disruption." This is not easy to do, yet it is consistent with what it takes to achieve success in this space. It is especially not easy to do in a large, complex corporation. And, herein lies the problem. Can Mr. Nadella return to basics and focus on what Microsoft does best and can Microsoft recharge itself to "hit the next wave" on a regular basis. Telling us how he is going to do this is a basic part of Mr. Nadella's picture of the future and his ability to convincingly convey that picture on to others.
