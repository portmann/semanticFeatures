InvenSense: Not All Apple And Samsung - InvenSense (NYSE:INVN) | Seeking Alpha InvenSense trades near lows as the smartphone market weakens and primary customers shift premium focus. Opportunity outside of smartphones continues to provide a potential catalyst for the next rally. Ever since going public at the end of 2011, InvenSense (NYSE: INVN ) has seen their stock spend a considerable amount of time retesting the $10 level. The motion sensing technology leader continues to struggle to move from a level of developing a market into consistent and profitable growth due to binary decisions with big customers. At $8, INVN trades at the lowest level in its more than four-year history. The company though has the largest opportunity ahead in their corporate history. Is the stock worth a shot at an enterprise value below $600 million? The biggest mitigating problem with InvenSense over the last few years was the consolidation of the premium smartphone market into two big players. The chip supplier decisions of these two customers, along with the power they wield, pressures margins and provides for wide swings in revenues. As Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) ramped up use of InvenSense sensors over the last couple of years, Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) began to shift toward a cheaper solution. The company forecasts Samsung will drop to a single-digit revenue customer, down from levels prior to Apple where the smartphone producer would consistently provide over 30% of revenues. In the latest quarter alone, these two large customers accounted for a combined 60% of revenues, up from 53% in FQ2. These levels of revenues and the large proportion of revenues the customers derive from smartphones, such as the iPhone for Apple, leads to binary problems for InvenSense. The recent teardowns of the Samsung Galaxy S7, including this one from iFixit, confirm the results of the company for FQ3 and the guidance for FQ4. The removal of InvenSense from the phone is a prime reason for the weak results. The market though is looking through the rear view mirror with the opportunity ahead to take share back from Samsung versus lose further share. The key though is that the future is based on the new market opportunities I wrote about in December , as InvenSense shifts toward the Internet of Sensors. The company's recent corporate presentation provides more details on the growth strategies that will move InvenSense away from a reliance on smartphones. The amazing part of the InvenSense story is that growth of the company via market share gains in Apple and Samsung hasn't provided any increase in the value of the stock. While revenues surged over the last two years, the stock price and hence corresponding PS ratio has collapsed to incredible lows. Signing up these large customers hasn't helped with the stock valuation down to only a little over $700 million. Combined with $150 million in net cash and a profitable company, the balance sheet is rock solid and leaves the stock with an enterprise value of only $580 million. With revenue expectations sitting at over $400 million this and next fiscal year, the stock is scrapping the bottom of any reasonable valuation. The binary decisions of using InvenSense chips in key smartphones from Apple and Samsung will dictate revenues in the short term. The long-term story and reason to own the stock is the opportunity in the IoT and wearables that increase the total addressable market and diversify the revenue base.
