Disney, Time Warner lower as Bernstein downgrades on fee worries - Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (NASDAQ:FOX) | Seeking Alpha To screen ETFs by asset class, performance, yield and more, check out the ETF Hub. ETF Hub Aug 20 2015, 09:49 ET | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Walt Disney ( DIS -3.1%) and Time Warner ( TWX -2.3%) are both off following downgrades from Sanford Bernstein, to Market Perform, on the usual worries about affiliate fees. The market is valuing ad-supported TV businesses as " structurally impaired assets ," Bernstein's Todd Juenger writes, which is "fair and warranted, because: a) we believe TV advertising is undeniably in secular decline; and b) affiliate fees are now also being put at increased risk." One media name that deserves conviction, by contrast, is Twenty-First Century Fox ( FOX -1.1%, FOXA -1%), he says: "There is simply too much growth in FY17-18 to keep the stock below ~$40," but even so he's cautious in nearer-term quarters. Investors will go long and short on media dependent on their feelings about cord-cutting and affiliate fees, he says, but enough complexities still exist in the sector to create opportunities.
