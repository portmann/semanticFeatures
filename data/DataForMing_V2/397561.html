Apple: Why Everyone Hates Tim Cook Right Now - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Computers create, consumer electronics receive. The upgrade cycle is much, much slower. Tim Cook was on the TV yesterday, defending his record and predicting great things. He talked about China's growing middle class. He talked about India becoming bigger than China. He talked about service revenue, $6 billion and growing. A few years ago this would have sent the stock shooting up. This time it smacked of desperation. We want more details. Total sales seem to have fallen off a cliff and the company isn't expecting a quick pick-up. You can sell on that news. You can even sell short on that news. If you sold short, even right after earnings, you have made money. But Apple now plans to buy back $250 billion in stock (on a $520 billion market cap) by the end of 2018. The dividend just got another hike, to 57 cents, and the yield is now up to 2.43%. The current price/earnings multiple is 10.4. Take out the cash, the way the bulls did back in the day, which is to say 2013, and this is practically an auto stock. It's hard to see just how much further down the bears can push it. The biggest problem I saw in this quarter's numbers had nothing to do with i-anything. It was the fall-off in Macintosh sales that I found disturbing, down almost 13% to 4 million. The difference between a device and a PC was that the former is mainly a passive device, like a TV, while the latter could create content, like this article. Apple has turned PCs into consumer electronic stacks, and thus it is now subject to the economics of consumer electronics, which are different from those of PCs. PCs traditionally had short upgrade cycles. You bought a new PC, even though the old one worked, because there was new software that only ran on the new one, with content-creation features you needed. Consumer electronics have a much-slower upgrade cycle. You bought a new stereo only when the old one broke, when you could no longer do the thing you bought it to do. This reality is now impacting the entire device space. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) has compensated by making itself into a cloud-first company. In his interview Cook talked vaguely about exciting new products and features that will spur upgrades, and convince consumers that they need to junk, say, their iPhone 5s for 7s. The problem for the stock is that, right now, no one knows what those exciting, new features could possibly be. Bots? Home automation? Medical applications - the true "killer apps" I have been seeking for a decade? Who knows? No one. Until that question is answered, Apple will remain, like the PC industry, subject to consumer electronics economics. And this is not a good thing. Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL, MSFT.
