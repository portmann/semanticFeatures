ETF Hub Apr  3 2015, 15:51 ET | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Fantasy sports is a big-money industry, and now Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS ) is buying a piece with a $250M investment in DraftKings , The Wall Street Journal reports. The investment values DraftKings -- where fantasy sports fanatics play each other with real money stakes -- at about $900M, and it comes with a nice benefit: DraftKings has committed to spend more than $500M on ESPN-platform ads in the coming years. A rival company, FanDuel, has backing from Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) -- and while FanDuel can keep advertising on ESPN, it won't get the premium slots that DraftKings will. Compared with popular fantasy games already on ESPN, CBS and Yahoo, real-money businesses may tap into lucrative streams of revenue (rakes?) that aren't possible only on ad-supported platforms.
