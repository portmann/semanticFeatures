Yes To Facebook's Free Basics Internet For All Program - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Tim Berners-Lee is actively protesting Facebookâ€™s free internet access for all program. Facebook has rebranded its Internet.org initiative to Free Basics and it now let people download and use a mobile app to access websites at zero data charge. Berners-Lee assessed Free Basics as a walled-garden approach that violates his view what net neutrality should be. I see free basics as a great free tool for students, teachers, and underprivileged people to tap online education materials. Tim Berners-Lee, the famous originator of the World Wide Web, made it clear that he wants people to say no to Facebook's (NASDAQ: FB ) branded free internet initiative, Free Basics . Free Basics is Facebook's non-profit organization that seeks to provide a select number of websites for free to underserved people living in developing countries. Free Basics is a non-profit partnership that taps the help of leading wireless operators allow free access to some websites on the approved list of Facebook's Free Basics program. All the wireless telcos here in the Philippines (a country of more than 7,100 islands) already signed up for this program. Berners-Lee hinted that Free Basics or formerly known as Internet.org, was a scheme that violates the net neutrality principle he holds dear. My own take is that Berners-Lee would have said yes to Free Basics if Facebook offers free access to all websites, not just a few ones. He argued that Free Basics' decision to offer only a select number of websites for free is somehow contrarian to the ideal vision of free flow of information that Berners-Lee aspired to when he created the World Wide Web. However, I'm a greedy capitalist and an FB long. Berners-Lee demand for Free Basics to enable free access to all websites is going to be detrimental not only to Facebook's bottomline, but also to wireless carriers, internet service providers, and premium subscription-only website owners. I am therefore going to contradict Berners-Lee and say yes to a selective Free Basics program. Limiting it to essential websites that help students, teachers, and poor people to learn important online educational materials is already satisfactory. Facebook is already clearly spending big money for Free Basics even if it only provides free access to a limited number of websites. The carriers themselves would not have agreed to support Free Basics if they did not get some kind on incentives from Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg already said last year that Facebook's Connectivity Lab is working hard and will spend money on satellites, drones, unmanned solar-powered aircrafts, and lasers to help provide free internet access to remote locations in the world. I certainly do not want Facebook to spend more money to incentivize all website owners to provide free access to their premium-content only websites. Zuckerberg also made it clear that any website owner or developer is free to submit their sites for inclusion to the Free Basics non-profit initiative. Instead of encouraging people to boycott Free Basics, I more of expected Berners-Lee to urge website owners to say yes to Free Basics. The only requirement for any website to qualify for inclusion in Free Basics is it should be simple and data-efficient so that mobile operators don't lose too much money providing free internet access. It was not a Facebook-initiated requirement, the Free Basics partner carriers demanded that provision. It is not the fault of Facebook if Free Basics now only offers a limited number of sites that could be accessed for free. It is up to owners if they want they site to comply and be included to the free internet for all program of Facebook. The walled-garden accusation against Free Basics is therefore unfair and unjustified. It is true that Facebook will increase its advertising audience by enabling even the poorest of the poor to have free internet access. However, profiteering is clearly not the primary objective of Free Basics. It is primarily intended to help underprivileged citizens like poor Filipinos living in remote areas finish their research/thesis paper so they could graduate from college . In my country the unlimited 1-day only prepaid internet mobile service costs 50 pesos ($1.07). Sad but true, my country still has millions of students that cannot afford this $1/day prepaid mobile internet access. I also live in a town of over 35,000 people that is 80% residing in the remote mountainous areas. This huge population of my town mates are underserved because wireless carriers do not want to provide them with decent internet access because of it is uneconomical to put up cell towers in far flung areas. Facebook's dream of putting up satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles to provide free internet access is something I really admire. Free Basics will ultimately help billions of people get free access to online knowledge. FB has performed beyond my expectations this year. I am still however endorsing a Buy recommendation for this very smart company. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
