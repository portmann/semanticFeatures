Generating $100 A Month From Verizon - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha If you have a particular goal in mind, it can be helpful to â€œreverse engineerâ€? the process to give you a better feel for what your ambition might require. This is especially important in the world of finance, where basic math dictates a great deal of future possibilities. This article looks at the prospect of generating $100 per month from Verizon dividends. When first starting out in the investing world, it can be discouraging to see $5 or $10 dividend checks coming in after you'd heard stories about people living off their passive income. It seems like such a stretch to move from $10 a quarter to thousands of dollars each month. The solution, like most things, presents itself in time and effort. With enough time and with enough effort, you will eventually reach your goals. Of course this is straightforward to know in theory, but perhaps a bit more difficult in practice. If your investing timeframe is decades, it can be all too easy to wander off the path for a few months or years. To combat this, one strategy I like to advocate is to think about expense coverage. For instance, maybe your typical cereal expenditure equates to $15 per month. If you could get your hands on 90 shares of Kellogg ( K ), you'd effectively have an asset that's providing you with your morning meal for life. Once you start to cover the smaller expenses, you can move up to the larger ones. With regard to this article in particular, let's imagine that your cell phone bill is $100 per month. Assuredly this could be understated , but it nonetheless provides a baseline from which we can begin to think about the process. Whether your carrier is Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) or not doesn't matter; the central concept is to own a piece of a company that passively pays your bills. One hundred dollars per month is equal to $1,200 per year. Verizon just finished paying its fourth $0.55 quarterly dividend for a trailing annual payout mark of $2.20. If you wanted to reach your $100 per month goal instantly, this would require the purchase of about 546 shares at a cost of nearly $25,000. This is possible for some, but not particularly easy for most. The great majority of investors don't have $25,000 sitting around to invest, or at the very least don't have this amount of money readily available to invest into a single security. Yet this isn't the important part; we can get there over time. For this example let's assume you're starting at zero and want to get to the point of generating $100 per month in Verizon dividend checks by the end of a five-year period. In setting this goal, there are two important notes to make: 1) $100 in five years time likely won't have the same purchasing power as it does today and, 2) the payments will come in quarterly installments instead of monthly. Nonetheless this is nice, round goal to create and you can change the numbers to fit your personal situation. Let's see how you can get there. The first thing to think about is how the company might help you along the way. Verizon has not only paid but also increased its dividend every year dating back to 2007. It should be noted that prior to this the payment was frozen during different periods, but still was very much present and sustainable. Over the past decade the company was able to increase its payout by an average compound rate of about 3% annually. Moving forward, the analysts are expecting Verizon to grow in the mid-single digits. To keep prudent estimations, let's suppose that the dividend grows by 3% per year over the next half decade. Naturally the actual payments might be much higher or lower, but the above numbers still provide a reasonable starting point. In total these payouts would aggregate to just over $12 in dividends received, or about 27% of your initial capital deployed. Your yield-on-cost would move from 4.9% to 5.6%, showing that what the payout might lack in growth, it could certainly make up for in a hefty beginning yield. To generate $1,200 in annual expected income, you would need to accumulate about 471 shares of Verizon in the future. But you don't have to get there tomorrow. Instead, let's imagine that you regularly contribute $5,500 to an IRA or other investment account. If you invested $5,500 in Verizon today, this would net you about 122 shares or roughly $268 in annual income on a trailing basis. In the coming year, your expected income would increase to about $276 without any action on your part. If you reinvested these dividends, this might add 6 shares or so, to bring your total share count up to 128 or thereabouts. (In fact this could be understated depending upon the future share price and the frequency of your reinvestment.) Your anticipated annual income now, before thinking about the next dividend increase, would be about $290. A lot of people dismiss slower growers too quickly. Without adding any "fresh" capital on your part, you'd see total income growth of about 8%. Collecting and reinvesting a high yield is an underrated way of growing your overall income. At the beginning of the second year, if you can once again commit $5,500 towards your Verizon passive income endeavor, you would add perhaps 120 to 130 new shares and bring your anticipated income mark pretty close to $600. The reinvestment cycle continues, whereby you see say 7% to 8% total income growth based on "just" 3% dividend growth, getting you closer and closer to your goal. After about three and a half years of this, you would stand a solid chance of hitting your $100 per month goal. Of course you might not want to allocate this much of your contribution each year. In this case, $4,000 annual contributions coupled with reinvestment could reach the $1,200 annual dividend mark over a five-year period. If the goal was to reach $100 per month in dividends over a ten-year stretch, this might only require $1,700 or so in yearly contributions. In the end it's not about a specific number or Verizon in particular. Instead, it's about setting a goal and reverse engineering the process. You don't need to get discouraged because you can't reach your goal next week or next year; these things take time. To help combat this mindset, you can create intermediate targets and feed off the incremental success that results from building and sustaining a growing group of profitable partnerships.
