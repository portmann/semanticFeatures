Amazonâ€™s Experiment with Profitability - The Big Picture February 1, 2016 10:00am by Barry Ritholtz After Amazon.com missed analysts’ quarterly profit forecasts Thursday, investors lopped as much as 10 percent off of its stock price, the most in a year. The company reported fourth-quarter net income that more than doubled toÂ a record $482 million from a year earlier; revenue rose an astonishing 22 percent to $35.7 billion. Revenue in cloud services sales soared 69 percent to $2.4 billion. But let’s back up a bit, to 2014’s fourth quarter, when Amazon surprised investors by reporting a profit. I can’t believe I am about to type these words, but with the benefit of hindsight the company might have been better off reporting a loss then. It helps if we understand that Amazon Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos has spent more than two decades reinvesting earnings back into the company. That steadfast refusal to strive for profitability never seemed to hurt the company or its stock price, and Amazonâ€™s market value (now about $275 billion) passed Wal-Martâ€™s last year. All the cash it generated went into infrastructure development, logistics and technology; it experimented with new products and services, entered new markets, tried out new retail segments, all while capturing a sizable share of the market for e-commerce. How large a share? Overall, Amazon commands 22 percent of online sales. But it’s even more dominant than that data point suggests: Bloomberg reported that Amazon took in 39.3 percent of e-commerce spending from Nov. 1 through Dec. 6; on Cyber Monday, Amazon captured almost 36 percent of all online sales. Those are strong numbers, but the really eye-popping stuff was mentioned in a note from Macquarie Research: it estimates â€œthat for every $1 of e-commerce growth, Amazon will take 51 cents.â€?
