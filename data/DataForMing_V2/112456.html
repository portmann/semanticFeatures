Satya Nadella And Microsoft Are Starting To Gain My Respect - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Mr. Nadella has laid off 7,800 more Microsoft employees and disposed of the rest of the Nokia smartphone business. Over a year and a half Mr. Nadella has made some very good changes. There's still more to do in the future, like developing a more complete vision for the company, but it seems to me that he is capable of doing that. Satya Nadella, Microsoft"s (NASDAQ: MSFT ) CEO, is beginning to gain my respect. Mr. Nadella has taken a year and a half to do it, but he's moving much faster than did Jeffrey Immelt after he was promoted to the top seat at General Electric (NYSE: GE ). The reason for the change in spirit? Mr. Nadella's most recent move in admitting the mistake of acquiring Nokia's smart phone business, obtained by Steve Ballmer, and getting rid what Microsoft had left of the business. Also the reduction in the workforce by 7,800 people, sad as it may be for the people, is a big plus for Microsoft. It has taken Mr. Nadella this long to make some of these major moves, but his impact on the company seems to be growing and growing. It took Immelt and General Electric much longer to deal with the legacy of Jack Welch. But now that's happening as well. I now believe that Mr. Nadella will continue to make moves that are beneficial. The problem still remains, however, that Mr. Nadella needs to more fully lay out his vision for the future. It is not yet clear to me that he has clearly defined this future although he has put out some images of what it may look like. There's no question that Mr. Nadella has a huge job in front of him. The good thing is that Microsoft has a very good platform from which to work and continues to post a return on equity that's north of 15 percent. However, he still has to define a sustainable competitive advantage for the company in the future and this is where I believe that he has continued to come up short. We will excuse this in terms of dealing with a massive and complex company. Microsoft is not under the time pressure to create a "turnaround" as if it were a distressed company. Microsoft, and Mr. Nadella, have the job of creating a restructured company that will serve the future and not the past. In getting to the future, however, Mr. Nadella has to deal with the legacy of Steve Ballmer and continue to out sort out what stays and what goes. There remains quite a task to perform. The cloud may be the future sustainable competitive advantage, but I'm not totally convinced of this. I don't think that what is developed here is sustainable against the other competitive pressures working in this space. I believe that there are places in Microsoft that Mr. Nadella can find the future. But, in order to do this, he is going to have to shed some other peripheral products that just distract from the whole. For example, I think the whole xBox thing has to be re-examined to determine what it really contributes to the future path the company will follow. Bottom line for me, however, is that Mr. Nadella is moving in the right direction. I look forward to what "surprises" he will bring us in the future.
