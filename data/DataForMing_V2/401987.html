July 29 marks the last day that Windows 10 will be a free upgrade for existing Windows users (it’ll be $119 to upgrade after that point), and it’s also the last time anyone will see an annoying pop-up notification to “Get Windows 10.” â€œDetails are still being finalized, but on July 29th the Get Windows 10 app…will be disabled and eventually removed from PCs worldwide,â€? Microsoft told WinBeta in a written statement. Which is certainly a relief for the many customers who were irked to find Windows 10 downloading on its own , or seeing it appear as a “recommended update” . Microsoft says Windows 10 is now on 300 million active devices, with a goal of getting more than 1 billion devices running the operating system actively on a monthly basis, PCWorld notes .
