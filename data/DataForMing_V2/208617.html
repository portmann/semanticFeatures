Intel LTE Modems Might Get Inside iPhones And Apple Processors Next Year - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel now allegedly has 1,000 people working to integrate the XMM 7360 LTE modem inside a future iPhone. VentureBeat also said Intel might win a foundry manufacturing deal for an Apple A-series SoC using its 14nm process. I already made it clear in August that Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) could have notable economic benefits if Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) would use the XMM 7360 LTE modem inside some of its next-generation iPhones. A recent news item from Seeking Alpha again informed me this morning that Intel now has 1,000 people working hard to fit the XMM 7360 LTE modem inside an iPhone slated for release next year. This latest report should now convince more people that Apple is really very interested in using the XMM 7360. Yes, it was previously hard for Intel to land a modem supply deal with Apple because Intel's older modems are not compatible with CDMA. I was wrong and no XMM 7260 was used inside the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. However, the newer, much better Intel XMM 7360 LTE modem might just find its way inside iPhones next year. The Intel-made XMM 7360 is a Cat. 10 LTE Advanced modem that supports 3x carrier aggregation . It can do up to 450 Mbps download speed. The iPhone 6s is still using only a Cat. 6 LTE Advanced Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) MDM9635 modem, which reportedly only has 225 Mbps top download speed. Since Apple will allegedly use Intel-made modems for iPhones intended for emerging markets, it doesn't bother me at all if these modems will not find their way inside iPhones intended for sale in America. My point is that Intel doesn't really need to go crazy in trying to make its LTE modems work 100% with CDMA EV-DO standard of some U.S. carriers. The iPhone business is not limited to the U.S. market. My understanding is that Apple will allegedly double-source its modem needs from Qualcomm and Intel. Apple can sell its Qualcomm modem-equipped CDMA-friendly iPhones in the U.S. and the Intel-equipped ones in other foreign markets. Aside from the obvious economic benefits from putting the XMM 7360 inside an iPhone, Intel urgently needs a substantial deal with Apple to help it improve its reputation among retail investors and hedge fund managers. Apple is still the best outfit when it comes to selling high-margin luxury smartphones. Having a product inside an iPhone is a major PR coup. As of now only Asustek ( OTC:ASUUY ) is aggressively using an Intel-made processor/discreet LTE modem combo for Android phones. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) again ignored the XMM 7260, Atom x3, and x5 for its latest Lumia Windows 10 phones. Apple's brand power also moves more iPhones than Asustek could ever achieve. Getting half or even just a quarter of the annual LTE modem supply needs of the iPhone is already a blockbuster win for Intel. The LTE modem/baseband processors is a huge part of the Bill of Materials of the iPhone 6s. Tech Insights lumped the cost of the LTE modem with the processor but as we can see from the charts below, the LTE modem/baseband processors could comprise $15-$25 of an iPhone's total BOM. If we estimate that Intel might supply 50 million LTE modems to iPhones next year and we use a $15 contract price per unit XMM 7360, we could say this supply deal could be worth $750 million. Of course, the 50 million unit estimate is rather conservative since Apple could actually sell more than 150 million iPhones per year. A source of VentureBeat is also saying that Apple is requesting Intel to possibly manufacture a system-on-chip ((SoC)) that integrates an Intel-made LTE modem inside an A9-series processor. The alleged deal entails Apple designing the said SoC under its own brand name and will only license the LTE modem IP from Intel. VentureBeat's source also said Apple is allegedly interested in Intel's large-scale 14-nanometer chip manufacturing process, which is believed to be superior to Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) and TSMC's (NYSE: TSM ) foundry capabilities. Apple is also allegedly very interested in Intel's upcoming 10-nanometer process. which is coming in 2017. It remains to be seen if Intel will be willing to license its XMM 7360 product for Apple to customize. However, winning a fabrication deal for Apple's next-generation chips is another major tailwind for the company. Like I said earlier, Apple is still the best-selling vendor when it comes to pricey phones and tablets. Partnering with it could help Intel reduce its huge operating losses on mobile chips. The persistent rumor that Apple is negotiating with Intel to use its LTE modem for some iPhone models is one more reason why we should all stay long INTC. Before Intel bought it , Infineon modems/baseband processors were used inside earlier models of the iPhone. You could explain this recent rumor from VentureBeat by surmizing that Apple only wants more customization control over the modems/connectivity components of its iPhone product. I have no basis, but I speculate Qualcomm probably rejected Apple's request and Tim Cook is now trying to negotiate a similar modem IP licensing with Intel. I hope Intel will consider acceding to the request of Apple to get full design rights over the alleged LTE modem/A9 processor SoC. Intel could then demand in return that Apple should give it an exclusive chip manufacturing deal in exchange for licensing the LTE modem technology. Sad but true, Intel needs Apple more than Apple needs Intel. Rejecting Apple's alleged request for customization of its chip design might drive the iPhone maker to find alternative partners for its upcoming LTE-embedded A-series processor. INTC is a buy. I know the stock has breached the $33 price level, but I still believe it has a lot more room to fly higher. The alliance of Intel and Apple might not remain exclusive to Mac computers, a mobile chip partnership is also highly desirable for both companies.
