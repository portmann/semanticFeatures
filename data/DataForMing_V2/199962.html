Ask the Readers: What Was Your First Job? One of the milestones of adulthood is getting your first job. It's where many of us got our first taste of the "real world" — working with other people that you may not like, managing our money, and handling difficult situations. Some of us started working from a young age — maybe at a family business — and some waited until after college. Either way, you probably learned a lot from your first job. What was your first job? What lessons did you learn from this job? Do you have any memories from your first job that have stayed with you over the years? Tell us about your first job and we'll enter you in a drawing to win a $20 Amazon Gift Card! Post your answer in the comments below. One commenter will be randomly selected to win a $20 Amazon Gift Card! You can tweet about our giveaway for an extra entry. Also, our Facebook fans can get an extra entry too!
