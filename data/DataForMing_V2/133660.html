Intel And 3D XPoint Processors - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha Intel and Micron have announced 3D XPoint memory with new materials and new 3D XPoint technology. In the past Intel has applied new technology developed for memory to develop new processor technology. Intel will likely further develop the new materials and 3D XPoint technology to improve Intel processors, continuing Moore's Law in scalable 3D. A scalable 3D XPoint processor could then be combined with memory to produce a wafer that has processor and memory. Now that Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) and Micron (NASDAQ: MU ) have announced a new storage class memory with 3D XPoint memory, a next step is likely that Intel will take the new materials and 3D XPoint technology and apply it to their processors. When the new materials and 3D XPoint technology are applied to Intel processors the processor and memory/storage can be further integrated at the silicon level producing extremely small, powerful, low power and lower cost devices with the processor and all-needed memory and storage on one silicon. This quantum leap in linking processors and more memory/storage - integrating processor and memory/storage in 3D on silicon - could send Intel stock soaring as this new silicon would dramatically speed up computing in data centers and increase powerful processing in smaller, lower power use and lower cost mobile and IoT devices. New frontiers in computing would be opened with full computers being almost invisible to the human eye. In the past new materials, manufacturing and technology have often been explored and applied first to memory and then applied to processors. In 1968 when Intel was first formed it was primarily a memory maker. During the 1970s and 1980s Intel applied what they learned from making memory to making processors and left the business of producing memory. However, Intel kept developing memory technology and in 2006 Intel and Micron formed a joint venture to develop new non-volatile memory. Intel's focus was on cutting edge memory technology while Micron took the lead in producing the memory. An example of materials being first developed for memory and then applied to processors is hafnium which was first developed and tested for memory during the 1980s and then later used in processors in 2007. Now Intel/Micron have announced new materials and new 3D XPoint technology for memory. While the details of the new materials and technology were not provided, these new proprietary innovations will have far reaching impacts on the entire semiconductor sector. In the announcement Intel also has said they will develop new products using this technology. Intel will likely also develop fabs to produce this new memory independent of Micron in order to meet the huge demand that's likely to develop. These new materials and 3D XPoint technology will likely be applied to processors to increase the density, reduce the power use and increase the speed of Intel processors. These new materials and 3D technology will likely help Intel achieve greater density, faster speed, lower energy use and lower cost in processors and continue Moore's law in 3D. Intel has once again shown its ability to innovate new materials and new technology. First in memory, to be followed by similar materials and 3D XPoint innovations in processors and then in integration of memory/storage and processor at the silicon level so that one barely visible piece of silicon will function as a complete computer with processing, memory, storage and communication absorbing energy to run from its surroundings. For more about energy harvesting see the presentation by Wen-Hann Wang, Vice President, Managing Director, Intel Labs at the Intel IoT Insights 2014 ( IoT Insights energy harvesting ). This integrated memory/storage/processor silicon technology may seem for off and it clearly will not affect Intel earnings in 2015 or even 2016. However, machine thinking made possible by Intel processors is accelerating technological development. These types of quantum leaps in technology by Intel will transform Intel into a growth stock with Price to Earnings (PE) ratios in the 18 to 20 range creating a valuable investment opportunity. Even with analyst estimated earnings of $1.20 for the second half of 2015 , Intel with significant innovative announcements could reach over $40 by the end of 2015.
