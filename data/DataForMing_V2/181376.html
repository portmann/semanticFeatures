U.S.-China tech tie-ups on the rise - Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) | Seeking Alpha Sep 24 2015, 03:54 ET | By: Yoel Minkoff , SA News Editor More partnerships between Chinese and U.S. technology firms are being announced during Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to the United States this week. Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ) is forming a joint-venture with server maker Inspur to sell networking and cloud computing products in China, where the company faces political pressure and declining sales. Meanwhile, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) is partnering with Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU ) and Tsinghua Unigroup to sell cloud services to Chinese state-owned enterprises. Microsoft also struck a deal with China Electronics Technology Group to explore ways to deploy a "localized" version of Windows 10. There was a lot of "entrenched trade" among European nations (in fact they were damn near intertwined) up to 1914, but that didn't prevent WWI. As far as I'm concerned the more "entrenched trade" our companies do with  China, the easier it will be for those Chinese to steal our technology.
