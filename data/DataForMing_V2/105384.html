Ford Pulls A Tesla - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha News hit the wire today about a massive Ford recall involving over 430,000 vehicles. The recall is due to software issues that could potentially keep the engine running after the vehicle is shut off. Like all software issues, it's an easy fix and hardly a "recall" - Tesla had this happen to them months ago. Ford (NYSE: F ) shares slumped Thursday, closing down just under 1% at $14.87, heading into the long weekend. Those that aren't in the Hamptons with a buzz on and barbecuing yet, combined with the algos who don't get days off, dinged Ford a bit. We think part of it could be a misrepresentation of some news that was issued early Thursday. Here's what a move down on ugly volume looks like. We think the company is feeling a little heat from its latest recall headline, probably purposefully put out ahead of the long weekend. It reads , Ford is recalling about 433,000 of its 2015 Focus, C-Max and Escape vehicles for a problem with the body control module. The software glitch could allow the engine to continue to run after the ignition is turned off and the key removed or the after pressing the "engine stop" button. The automaker said it is not aware of any accidents or injuries resulting from the problem. Dealers will update the software to fix the issue. It wasn't that long ago that Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA )rumors of the company having to perform a massive recall were misjudged by the market and saw the shares sell off as a result. It was a misunderstanding by the market who didn't understand that a "recall" doesn't always mean that a vehicle is going to have to be turned back into the company. Years ago, recall was synonymous with this. In today's age of cars being half vehicle, half computer, it's a different story. Today, Ford is probably feeling some of the same heat. We think it's a non-event. Like the Tesla issue from 2014, this Ford recall has to do with the software, not the hardware of the vehicle. This generally means easy fixes similar to the way you download updates to your home computer's operating system. This Motley Fool article from 2014 talks about the Tesla recall and concludes: Therefore, as Tesla CEO Elon Musk was quick to point out today on his Twitter account, this isn't a "recall" in the traditional sense. Similar to a laptop computer, the Model S can receive software updates over a WiFi connection that improve the car's performance or, in this case, fix problems. While Ford vehicles are unlikely to be able to update through Wi-Fi, getting them to your local dealer will solve the problem, albeit probably in the process of soaking up your time. 4.
