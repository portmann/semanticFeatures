New Defense Bill Could Give Boeing A Boost In Coming 3 Months - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha President Obama recently signed into law a $607 billion spending bill for the military, of which Boeing should benefit. The stock appears to be fairly valued right now based on next year's earnings estimates and earnings growth expectations with great near-term earnings growth prospects. The Boeing Company (NYSE: BA ) is one of the world's major aerospace firms. The company operates in three principal segments: commercial airplanes; military aircraft and missiles; and space and communications. On October 21, 2015, BA reported its third-quarter earnings of $2.52 per share, which beat analyst estimates by $0.30. In the past year, the company's stock was up 11.03% and beat the S&P 500, which has gained 1.23% in the same time frame. I recently bought the stock in the speculation portion of my portfolio, but haven't evaluated it here on Seeking Alpha in over a year. With President Obama signing a new defense bill into law , I feel that it is important to evaluate it on a fundamental, financial, and technical basis to see if it's worth adding additional shares to my portfolio. The company currently trades at a trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 18.52, which is fairly priced, but I mainly like to purchase a stock based on where the company is going in the future as opposed to what it has done in the past. On that note, the one-year forward-looking P/E ratio of 15.66 is currently fairly priced for the future in terms of the right here, right now. The one-year PEG ratio (1.31), which measures the ratio of the price you're currently paying for the trailing 12-month earnings on the stock while dividing it by the earnings growth of the company for a specified amount of time (I like looking at a one-year horizon), tells me that the company is fairly priced based on a 1-year EPS growth rate of 14.17%. The company has great near-term future earnings growth potential with a projected EPS growth rate of 14.17%. Below is a table of how the fundamentals fared each time I've written about the stock: On a financial basis, the things I look for are the dividend payouts, return on assets, equity and investment. The company pays a dividend of 2.47% with a payout ratio of 46% of trailing 12-month earnings while sporting return on assets, equity and investment values of 5.7%, 75.9%, and 32.6%, respectively, which are all respectable values. The really high return on equity value (75.9%) is an important financial metric for purposes of comparing the profitability, which is generated with the money shareholders have invested in the company to that of other companies in the same industry (for comparison purposes, Boeing has the third highest ROE in the aerospace/defense products & services industry out of 42 companies). As you can see from the table below, the ROE has increased significantly over the past year, and if you'd like to know why, I recently wrote an article about the situation. The really high return on investment value (32.6%) is an important financial metric because it evaluates the efficiency of an investment that a company makes, and if an investment doesn't have a positive ROI, then the investment should not be made (for comparison purposes, Boeing has the second highest ROI in the aerospace/defense products & services industry out of 42 companies). Because I believe the market may get a bit choppy here and would like a safe play, I believe the 2.47% yield of this company is good enough alone for me to take shelter in for the time being. The company has been increasing its dividends for the past four years. Below is a table of how the financials fared each time I've written about the stock: Looking first at the relative strength index chart (RSI) at the top, I see the stock is dropping from near overbought territory with a current value of 57.99 relative to the rest of the market. I will look at the moving average convergence-divergence (MACD) chart next. I see that the black line is below the red line with the divergence bars decreasing in height, which tells me bearish momentum is in the name. As for the stock price itself ($147.43), I'm looking at $154.64 to act as resistance and the 200-day simple moving average (currently $142.51) to act as support for a risk/reward ratio which plays out to be -3.34% to 4.89%. Fundamentally, I believe the company to be fairly valued now on next year's earnings estimates and on earnings growth expectations with great near-term earnings growth expectations. Financially, the company pays a decent dividend and has great returns on equity and investments. On a technical basis, the risk/reward ratio shows me there is more reward than risk right now. I actually initiated my position in Boeing earlier this week, and won't be surprised if I bought my initial position near the current top in the name. But I'm never looking to initiate a full position in the name immediately, and will not until it gets to below $137, at least. I never like to dive full bore into a name, I always buy in increments. To boot, I'll be getting paid a 2.5% dividend yield to wait. I swapped out of General Electric (NYSE: GE ) for Boeing during the portfolio change-out earlier this week, because I had a huge gain in GE (25.8%) and felt that it might lag the rest of the market for the coming three months. So, hopefully I got out near the top in GE, and hopefully Boeing beats it for the coming quarter. For now, here is a chart to compare how GE and Boeing have done against each other and the S&P 500 since I swapped the names. Though the chart shows a 0.61% loss in Boeing, I am actually down 0.4% on the name because I bought it towards the middle of the day on November 24, 2015.
