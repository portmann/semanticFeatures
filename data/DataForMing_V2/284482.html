It's Time To Go Bargain-Hunting | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL, SVU, GNW. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. The market has plunged in the first week of 2016, but fears appear overblown. Fears over China, the Middle East and North Korea are nothing new and should not lead you to panic sell, but rather look for opportunity. The market is now close to "flash crash" levels it hit in August, which was an ideal buying opportunity. Many stocks are now trading at bargain levels and could provide significant long-term upside potential. Right now, I am buying shares of Apple, which are down more than 10% in the past week, as well as some more speculative but higher-potential stocks. The first trading days of 2016 have been terrible for the stock market. It appears that everyday the market is open this year it wants to drop by hundreds of points. It seems that a flood of recent negative news overseas is fueling panic selling by some investors. In just the past few days, reports have come out about tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran, a stock market plunge in China, a seemingly endless plunge in oil, a nuclear bomb test by North Korea, etc. All of this bad news has come in almost all at once and it has created a significant market pullback. We saw this kind of spooky market action just a few months ago when the market suffered a steep and sudden decline in just a matter of days. These types of sharp pullbacks suddenly make it look like the world is ending and it certainly feels like it when investors check their portfolios. However, investors who bought into the big market plunge in August were quickly rewarded. Furthermore, many of the issues that have roiled the markets in early 2016 are really nothing new. China has been slowing down for a while and its stock market has always been volatile, North Korea has tested nukes a few times in the past several years and there always seems to be tension in the Middle East. In addition, falling oil prices is hardly news and we know it can't drop forever. Another factor that might have the market upset is that some members of the Federal Reserve have recently come out to talk about 3 to 5 rate hikes in 2016. I think this is ridiculous and the market seems to agree, because financial stocks are not getting a boost from this outlook and the ten-year Treasury Bond is trading with about a 2% yield. When markets see this type of selloff momentum, it is easy to panic and become irrational. It probably doesn't help that negative headlines and market declines tend to bring out fear mongers. Suddenly you start to see CNBC create special shows that feature very bearish guests and analysts. In market selloffs, it also seems like machines and algorithms and technical analysis takes over, while common sense and fundamentals temporarily go out the door. If you look at the fundamentals, it really makes no sense to sell stocks now because interest rates are extremely low, the Federal Reserve remains accommodative, and the World Bank still estimates that global growth will be nearly 3% for 2016 . In addition, China has plenty in reserves and other tools in order to stimulate the economy, if it needs to do so. There is just way too much short-term thinking in this world today and that is another reason why these sharp and sudden pullbacks can create ideal buying opportunities. Keep in mind that if the world is ending, you won't need your cash anyhow, and if the world doesn't end, you are (historically) far better off owning stocks over the long-term. With all this in mind, I have recently been buying in this market pullback. One stock I like now is Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) which is not too far from the "flash crash" lows it hit last year of roughly $93 per share. For weeks now, a platoon of analysts have come out to take down iPhone sales estimates based on supplier checks. It seems like every time another analysts comes out to parrot the last analyst about slower iPhone sales, Apple shares take another leg down even though this is just a rehash of the news that has been out for weeks now. Furthermore, supplier channel checks have been wrong in the past and an "Apple Insider" article by Daniel Eran Dilger, published on January 7, 2016, suggests that iPhone sales remain very strong; it states : The product mix of iPhone models in Apple's real world installed base of users shows smooth adoption of iPhone 6s models and no evidence of a decline in demand that would require unexpected production cuts. This publicly available data severely undercuts the supply chain rumors supporting a narrative of "Peak iPhone" and reactionary order slashing. Now it appears that technicals and bears are in control and I hear many of them suggesting that Apple shares should be sold. This type of thinking was wrong in August as Apple shares very quickly rebounded from the August selloff and went back to about $120. While I agree there is a slight "lull" in terms of new product releases, it makes no sense to me to sell Apple now for less than $100 per share, so that you can buy it back when it trades for $150 (which is near the average analyst price target), or more when the iPhone 7 and/or a car is released. Macrumors.com recently said that the iPhone 7 will be released in the Fall of 2016 , which is sooner than most expected. With the news of slower iPhone sales already being pounded into investor's minds for weeks now, expectations could be too low (or even based on bad supplier check information) and the company should not be trading for less than ten times earnings, especially given its huge cash horde. I doubt Apple shares will be trading below $100 as we get closer to the iPhone 7 release, or when a potential Apple car is becoming the focus of the media. As the chart below shows, Apple shares are now oversold and trading close to the August "flash crash" lows. That was a major buying opportunity and that is just one reason why I am buying in this pullback. The 50-day moving average is around $113 per share which could be where the stock heads to when markets calm down. I also have been buying up shares in Supervalu (NYSE: SVU ) which trades for just over $6 and with a PE ratio of about 9 times. This stock had recently started to move higher but it has been knocked back down in the market pullback. Lost in the big market drop today was news that Supervalu just filed to move forward with the spinoff of its Save-A-Lot division. Many analysts believe this move will unlock significant upside because Save-A-Lot is growing fast and it is likely to achieve a much higher valuation when it trades as a stand alone company. In addition, an analyst at TheStreet.com recently published an article that suggested Supervalu shares could have significant upside and set a $12 price target. I have also been buying Genworth (NYSE: GNW ) which trades for just over $3 per share. Genworth recently announced it would pay off $300 million of senior bonds for 100% of the principal amount in January, 2016. If you look at bonds this company has outstanding, you can see that the bonds are trading at very strong levels when compared to the recent stock price action. In fact, many Genworth bonds are trading at or near parity or even above parity which suggests that this company is much stronger than the current stock price suggests. Analysts expect this company will earn nearly $1 per share for 2016. That means this beaten down stock is incredibly cheap. Just days ago, an analyst at BTIG came out with new analysis on Genworth and set a $10 price target . are made.
