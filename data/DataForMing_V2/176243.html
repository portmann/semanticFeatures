What Investors Need To Know About ABC's 2015 Fall Schedule - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha ABC's 2014-15 produced a large number of hits that contributed to the network becoming the most watched in terms of "pure entertainment." The network's new roster of series complements what is already working, and won't look to rock the boat too much. ABC's "split-season" strategy and synergy with Disney are two competitive advantages that are hard for other networks to match. As the new fall season gets ready to debut, many are wading through the countless ads, promos and word-of-mouth buzz about which shows have the best chance to succeed … and, more importantly for investors, which network. Make no mistake a network's fall season has direct business implications on its parent company's bottom line and it is important to have a firm grasp on each channel's goals if you're considering putting your money with them. Keep it here as we go network-by-network. While CBS (NYSE: CBS ) and NBC were duking it out for total overall viewers and the 18-to-49 demo crown, Disney's (NYSE: DIS ) ABC threw in a curve ball. The network proved that when you factor out primetime sports, they were in fact the tops in pure entertainment content. The network was also the only network to gain in the 18-49 demo from season to season. It did this courtesy of new hits like Black-ish and How To Get Away With Murder and returning fare such as Scandal and Modern Family. What was also interesting was that the network renewed the most freshman series including all of its spring additions (also known as "mid-season replacements.") including Galavant, Marvel's Agent Carter, Secrets and Lies and anthology series American Crime. ABC's fall is built to mimic what has become a successful formula to them in past years … appeal to everyone. Is your family large and mixed? Check out Modern Family. Is your family blue collar? The Middle is for you. Jewish? No problem, there's The Goldbergs. You can see where I'm going here right? And that continued last year with Black-ish and Fresh Off The Boat joining the ranks of those aforementioned success stories. This fall looks for Dr. Ken (starring Hangover star Ken Jeong) to add to that list with an African American reboot of Uncle Buck and The Real O'Neals which follows a Irish-Catholic brood. Yet part of the reason for the success of past shows is their timeslots and while ABC is yet to slot Buck and O'Neals', Dr. Ken is going right after Last Man Standing on Friday nights … which hasn't been kind to past inhabitants (0 for 3 to be exact). On the drama front, ABC is launching its schedule with two new buzzy dramas … Blood & Oil and Quantico, with more on the way for the spring. For now these are strong choices to lead the season but it is a risky move airing them back-to-back. It's hard to ask viewers to invest their time into two rookie series (especially ones airing right after each other) given the risk of blowback by audiences who get invested and then have the show yanked unexpectedly. It creates bad blood and mistrust. The good news is that Quantico is likely going to be one of the most well-received new dramas of the fall across the board and Blood & Oil has the potential to be a sleeper. Quantico is a serialized thrilled about a rookie class of CIA agents, of which one is really a terrorist who will commit the biggest attack on American soil since 9/11 and Blood & Oil follows gold-seekers in the mountain of North Dakota with a cast including Don Johnson (Miami Vice) and Chase Crawford (Gossip Girl). They are diverse enough to work, but can they combat NBC's Sunday Night Football and AMC's The Walking Dead? Remember one big advantage ABC has is that it employs a split-season strategy, so series like Grey's Anatomy and Once Upon A Time run in two blocks of about 10 to 12 new episodes, which cuts down on the stop-start mentality that plagues other networks. It also allows the network to pick up more series than its rivals as it frees up 10 to 12 weeks for programmers to run new series without having to re-arrange their schedule in a drastic way. Last year every series that was given that "break period" run was renewed … a first for the network and executives are hoping for similar luck this year. First though they have to get through the fall and ABC seems in a good position to do that, having only really solidified its already strong ranks. The program that will get the most buzz though is The Muppets which ties back into the company's synergy with parent company Disney. The series, which brings back the loveable Jim Henson creations, is taking a new approach by showing the Muppets' personal lives for the first time. Think of it as The Office meets The Muppet Show and so far the network has run an absolutely genius marketing and promotional campaign for the comedy. ABC may not technically have a ratings crown to point to like CBS and NBC, but it has one of the more well-defined identities of any of the big five. Not to mention being aligned with Disney helps in so many ways and for investors that will continue to pay off for years to come.
