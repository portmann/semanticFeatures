(GTATQ) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor Bankrupt GT Advanced ( OTCPK:GTATQ -6.2%) has obtained a debtor-in-possession (DIP) loan facility that will be used to "fund working capital requirements and pay other costs and expenses with respect to the administration of GT's and certain of its subsidiaries' Chapter 11 cases." Lenders include some of GT's convertible note holders. The loan "has a one year term and will be secured by all assets of the company on a super-priority basis." Apple previously raised objections to GT's efforts to obtain DIP financing, arguing it gives lenders too much leverage to foreclose on GT's sapphire furnaces, the sale of which are to be used to pay down Apple's loans to GT. The financing is contingent on GT receiving enough insurance money to pay for the damage caused to its furnaces by a May fire to Apple's Mesa, AZ facility.
