Apple: The World Has Yet To See 'Peak Mac' - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple has guided to a 9-14% y/y revenue decline for the March quarter, indicating a y/y decline in iPhone sales. Bears are pointing to this as proof of "Peak iPhone," that iPhone has now started a permanent decline. Despite tough competition, the Mac has yet to enter a permanent decline, and Mac sales were at an all-time high for fiscal 2015. Assuming that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) doesn't exceed its own guidance for the March quarter, the company will suffer a y/y revenue decline and probably a decline in iPhone sales as well. Some have asserted that this represents "Peak iPhone" and that iPhone sales will inevitably decline going forward. Such assertions ignore an important historical fact: the world has yet to see "Peak Mac." SA Contributor Neil Cybart wrote an interesting article ( Apple's Broken Narrative ), in which he shows a plot of unit sales for iPhone, iPad, iPod, and Mac going back to fiscal-year 2000. What caught my attention was the recent growth of Mac sales. It was a little hard to see in his chart, dwarfed by the larger sales of iPhone and iPad, so I decided to look at my own sales data (drawn from Apple's quarterly reports ) going back to 2003, which I show above. Except for the decline in 2013, annual Mac sales have been rising steadily since 2003. Fiscal 2015 represents an all-time high in Mac unit sales. The chart above represents the extent of the data I have, but to go further back in time, to the very origins of the Mac in 1984, I was able to dig up this chart of Mac unit sales. My point here is that there have been several peaks in Mac sales that could have been declared "Peak Mac" with the same sense of finality that some are now declaring Peak iPhone. For instance, SA Contributor Paulo Santos recently asserted (in his very first bullet point) that "It's now a certainty that the iPhone is going to start shrinking." Although I don't recall the term Peak Mac being used back in 1996, when Mac sales were being severely hurt by the arrival of Windows NT 4.0, there were many at the time who assumed Apple would go bankrupt. It's tempting when looking at one of the local peaks in the unit sales history to extrapolate a continuous downward trend. This is what's happening now on the basis of not even a quarter's worth of data, but only one quarter's guidance. When the Mac did suffer sales declines, it wasn't due to some inevitable physics, some force of sales gravity that must bend the trajectory of even the best product. Instead, there were very specific causes, the actions of competitors and the reactions of Apple's management, that led to the declines. For instance, the cause of the Mac sales decline in 2013 is obvious in retrospect. This was the first full year of the release of Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8, which had launched in October 2012. There was a lot of excitement among Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) supporters and investors, and certainly the perception that MSFT was on the comeback against Apple. But the Mac resumed its upward trajectory the following fiscal year. Despite its ups and downs over the years, AAPL has been able to continue to innovate in the Mac OS X operating system, in hardware platforms, and in services such as the Mac App Store, iMessage, and FaceTime for the Mac. Apple has been able to keep the platform fresh, and most importantly, keep it growing despite the competitive pressures of Microsoft and its hardware OEMs. Given that Apple has been able to achieve this with the Mac, how can anyone claim with certainty the iPhone is in permanent decline? If iPhone unit sales do decline in the March quarter, as seems likely, it will be the result of competitive pressures that Apple will have to deal with. The most significant competitive pressure that will appear in the March quarter is the probable release of Samsung's ( OTC:SSNLF ) new Galaxy S7 series smartphones in March. In the Android world, the release of the latest Galaxy is as big a deal as the release of the latest iPhone. The S7 does promise some innovations, including the latest Samsung Exynos 8 processor, as well as a force touch system similar to the 3D Touch system of the iPhone 6s. Samsung has scheduled a "Samsung Galaxy Unpacked" event on February 21 in Barcelona to kick off Mobile World Congress, and it appears that the company has moved up the start of sales to March. I had been assuming that the S7 would come out about the same time as did the S6, in April. Samsung moving up the S7 release to March is probably what caused Apple to revise downward its sales estimates for the quarter, along with all the macro and F/X headwinds that AAPL is seeing internationally. The early release of the S7 affects the year-over-year comps for the March quarter since Apple didn't have to contend with a new Galaxy until the June quarter. Apple will have to respond to the competitive challenge posed by the Galaxy S7 as well as other new smartphones that are introduced prior to the release of the iPhone 7 this September. It could feel like a long wait. Whatever happens to iPhone sales in the long run, it will be the result of decisions taken by Apple and its competitors, not the result of any law of physics. Apple's management is free to make good or bad decisions regarding iPhone. Nothing is inevitable. Based on the company's track record, I'm still confident that Apple will rise to the competitive challenge. AAPL has never been in a stronger competitive position in terms of its financial resources, talented personnel, and intellectual property. But the next few months will probably wear on the nerves of Apple's investors. Since the December-quarter earnings, the gloating of the Apple bears has been relentless, and it's unlikely to let up anytime soon. I wish it could be otherwise, but the next few months will definitely test the mettle of Apple investors. I remain long Apple and recommend it as a buy for those with long-term (3-5 year) investment horizons. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
