That’s why Apple says it has fixed a security flaw in the iOS operating system that allowed the Siri virtual assistant to search Twitter on locked iPhones, leading to the unauthorized access of photos and contacts. The flaw, which was first highlighted in a YouTubeÂ video , made it possible to access an iPhone 6S or 6S Plus userâ€™s contacts and photos from the lock screen by using the deviceâ€™s 3D Touch feature. The hack worked by asking Siri â€” from a locked screen â€” to search Twitter for any result with an email address. From there, the user couldÂ tap the email link using â€œforce touchâ€? and select â€œcreate new contactâ€? or â€œadd to contact.â€? This takes the user to the phoneâ€™s address book, where they could gain access to the other contacts and the photo library. While the issue only applied to devices in which users have integrated Siri with Twitter and photos, the bug proved it was possible to bypass iPhoneâ€™s security and openÂ the door to the hacks. Apple tells the Washington Post that it fixed the issue on Tuesday, preventing Siri from being allowed to search Twitter from the locked screen under any circumstance. The issue was corrected through Appleâ€™s server, so thereâ€™s no need for iPhone users to install an iOS update.
