Why EP Energy's Recent Weakness Is An Opportunity In Disguise - EP Energy Corporation (NYSE:EPE) | Seeking Alpha EP Energy's well costs are declining at a consistent rate. EP Energy will spend less on capital expenses this year, but it will still increase its production due to favorable production economics in the Eagle Ford. Returns from oil production in the Eagle Ford hover around 20% despite the drop in crude oil prices due to drilling efficiencies, so EP will continue investing in this play. EP has hedged almost all of its oil production in fixed price swaps at an attractive price, and this will lead to predictable and decent cash flows. EP Energy (NYSE: EPE ) has been under pressure this year, losing more than 5% on the stock market as the decline in oil prices has taken a toll on its performance. In fact, the company has missed consensus estimates by an average of 26% in the last two quarters. However, there are some key points about EP Energy that investors should not ignore, as they will come in handy when the oil market starts improving. EP operates in key shale plays in the U.S., which is why its oil production has increased at a CAGR of 68% from 2011 to 2014. This year, EP expects its oil production to be in the range of 56,000-64,000 Bbls/day. This is an increase of around 10% over its oil production in 2014 at the mid-point. More importantly, EP will be able to achieve this growth in production at a lower cost. The company has seen a steady decline in its well costs in recent quarters, as a result of which its earnings should improve when oil prices start picking up. Take a look at the following chart for example: Hence, it is clear that EP Energy has made good progress as far as reducing its well costs are concerned. In fact, the company plans to reduce cash costs by 10% this year, along with a 15% drop in overall service costs. EP will be able to achieve a lower cost structure by improving its drilling and enhancement efficiency, which will lead to a drop in its gross well costs, completion costs, well costs per foot, and a lower number of rig days. From the above chart, it is evident that EP Energy will be focusing on its assets in the key Eagle Ford shale play. This is not surprising, as the economics of production in the Eagle Ford are favorable even in the current oil pricing environment. For example, as another Eagle Ford operator Carrizo Energy (NASDAQ: CRZO ) points out , "We estimate that more than 80% of our Eagle Ford drilling locations are economical below $44 per barrels." According to the latest reports, production in the Eagle Ford increased last month despite a lower rig count. This means that operators in this shale play are able to generate more oil at a lower cost. As mySA points out: Producers in the Eagle Ford and Bakken are still incentivized to maintain their production levels thanks to sufficient economic returns in those plays, which currently average around 20 percent. Producers are countering the decline in rig count with a drive for efficiency gains in drilling and completion techniques and an increased focus on their more productive acreage. EP Energy is also following the same strategy of focusing on its key assets such as the Eagle Ford and the Wolfcamp in order to optimize production and costs this year, as shown in the chart above. More importantly, the company has also made a smart move by hedging its oil production. In fact, 90% of its production was hedged at the end of the previous quarter. For 2015, EP Energy has hedged 96% of its production at an average price of $91 a barrel. Investors should also note that 95% of EP's hedged production is through fixed price swaps , which means that EP will enjoy strong and predictable cash flows this year despite the weakness in oil pricing. Looking ahead, oil prices are expected to make a comeback in the next couple of years as per the EIA . Now, as oil prices move north, EP will be in a good position to enhance its operating and financial performance. The company is capable of producing more oil at lower costs, which is why it enjoys strong margins. In addition, it has made a smart move by hedging almost all of its production at an attractive price. Thus, despite recent weakness, EP Energy looks like a good long-term bet, and investors should consider capitalizing on the stock's weak performance this year by buying more shares.
