Senate Investigates "Abuse Of Trust" After Facebook Responds To Right-Wing Censorship Allegations | Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! In defending their long held short positions,  the Comex Banks have now issued enough new contracts to drive total open  interest back to levels not seen since 2011. Will they be successful in... Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! Update: The Senate just got involved... As ABC News report, Senator John Thune has sent letter to Facebook seeking information on alleged manipulation of news curation: As we detailed earlier, in response to allegations from former Facebook staff that they censored right-wing 'just not liberal enough' news stories in the social network's feed, the man who is responsible for Facebook's "Trending Topics" has issued a statement directly refuting the claims of biases. As TechCrunch noted , an earlier statement by Facebook that... “Facebook does not allow or advise our reviewers to systematically discriminate against sources of any ideological origin and we’ve designed our tools to make that technically not feasible. At the same time, our reviewers’ actions are logged and reviewed, and violating our guidelines is a fireable offense.” ...left it unclear whether any contractors hired to curate the trend had potentially violated those rules. “My team is responsible for Trending Topics, and I want to address today’s reports alleging that Facebook contractors manipulated Trending Topics to suppress stories of interest to conservatives. We take these reports extremely seriously, and have found no evidence that the anonymous allegations are true. Facebook is a platform for people and perspectives from across the political spectrum. There are rigorous guidelines in place for the review team to ensure consistency and neutrality. These guidelines do not permit the suppression of political perspectives. Nor do they permit the prioritization of one viewpoint over another or one news outlet over another. These guidelines do not prohibit any news outlet from appearing in Trending Topics. Trending Topics is designed to showcase the current conversation happening on Facebook. Popular topics are first surfaced by an algorithm, then audited by review team members to confirm that the topics are in fact trending news in the real world and not, for example, similar-sounding topics or misnomers. We are proud that, in 2015, the US election was the most talked-about subject on Facebook, and we want to encourage that robust political discussion from all sides. We have in place strict guidelines for our trending topic reviewers as they audit topics surfaced algorithmically: reviewers are required to accept topics that reflect real world events, and are instructed to disregard junk or duplicate topics, hoaxes, or subjects with insufficient sources. Facebook does not allow or advise our reviewers to systematically discriminate against sources of any ideological origin and we’ve designed our tools to make that technically not feasible. At the same time, our reviewers’ actions are logged and reviewed, and violating our guidelines is a fireable offense. There have been other anonymous allegations — for instance that we artificially forced ?#?BlackLivesMatter? to trend. We looked into that charge and found that it is untrue. We do not insert stories artificially into trending topics, and do not instruct our reviewers to do so. Our guidelines do permit reviewers to take steps to make topics more coherent, such as combining related topics into a single event (such as ?#?starwars? and?#?maythefourthbewithyou?), to deliver a more integrated experience. Our review guidelines for Trending Topics are under constant review, and we will continue to look for improvements. We will also keep looking into any questions about Trending Topics to ensure that people are matched with the stories that are predicted to be the most interesting to them, and to be sure that our methods are as neutral and effective as possible.” As TechCrunch concludes, Stocky’s explanation suggests that Gizmodo’s sources may have exaggerated the claims... It’s possible that what was perceived as suppression may have been shortcomings of the algorithm or hesitation to display Trends based on news outlets not deemed to be credible. So to be clear - another entity accused of wrongdoing has undertaken an internal review and found no evidence of wrongdoing. However, the report has already done significant damage to Facebook’s reputation with conservatives, and increased fears that it manipulates the world. Even if its records show no evidence of tampering with Trends, the perception of bias could haunt the company through the election season.

Free speech is also for everyone unless you disagree with what is happening. Everyone is earning their share in this crony capitalism unless they are banks and big corporations - this is what happens in Spain. Blaming the failures of bureaucratic, crony semi-socialist, heavily indebted system on the voluntary exchange (free market capitalism) has no valid logic in it.  It's time to open eyes for the investment around the globe to protect your money from Janet and co. http://independenttrader.org/how-to-pick-countries-for-future-investments.html Tue, 05/10/2016 - 13:10 | 7538854 Row Well Number 41 Tue, 05/10/2016 - 13:18 | 7538888 insanelysane Exactly.  They are a private company and can do what they like.  Anyone dumb enough to treat them as a source for news deserves what they get.

There is no reason a private company cannot do whatever they want with their own product.  If they want to censor purple people eaters from Facebook, they have the right to do so.  There should almost never be a case where congress is interrogating CEOs of private companies for just about anything. That said, what "conservatives" (whatever that means now) should do is simply stop using facebook altogether.  Companies respond (or should) to loss of revenue.  Tue, 05/10/2016 - 13:31 | 7538944 jeff montanye absolutely.  the new york times is hardcore zionist.  if that's not to your taste, don't buy it or read it for free.

Tue, 05/10/2016 - 13:27 | 7538929 tarsubil As far as I can see, Facebook is an opportunity for people with fucked up lives to pretend that their life is fucking perfect. Or it is an opportunity for people with fucked up lives to feel sorry for themselves. I used to post articles from ZH and others on there and got zero interest from anyone. No one there wants to have anything to do with reality. in the immortal words of my old maintenance sargent, SFC "Gin-gin": "that's Bu-bu-bu-bu-bullshit, sir."* Tue, 05/10/2016 - 13:04 | 7538834 Dg4884 Don't need to read the drivel to already know they are guilty as hell.  Why would you think otherwise of a leftist, open border, marxist sympathizer running the show.  That shit is tailor made for indoctrination and keeping tabs on the "trouble makers".  I'm sure the NSA has a dedicated database farm just for fagbook posts.

Tue, 05/10/2016 - 13:22 | 7538903 tedstr Fuckerberg is about to get schooled in how things really work.  See if you don't own an FCC license ansd you don't really run a news opertation that is desinged to control the sheeple, then when you pull something like is they are going to fuck with ou so that it looks like they actually try to keep the media legit.
