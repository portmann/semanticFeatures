Microsoft: Removing SMB/Enterprise Solution Silos And Better Integrating Aha - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha MSFT did some management restructuring recently which was aimed at improving cross product, cross division collaboration – but should Microsoft be looking to its actual platform as whole as well? Shouldn’t this be the first place Microsoft looks to optimize? For me, the most obvious need for consolidation is between Project, Visual Studio, and Team Foundation Server (also known as TFS). If Microsoft wants to start axing something it should start with silos separating its core products on the SMB/enterprise solution side. Remove the silos, stop creating unnecessary use friction and reasons to use non-Microsoft platforms, and make it easier to be the foundational productivity suite in the space. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) did some serious restructuring recently which was aimed at improving cross product, cross division collaboration - but should Microsoft be looking to its actual platform as whole rather than looking to cut management? Specifically I'm referring to the company's SMB/enterprise solution portfolio and the what I believe is apparent waste and inefficiency inherent in it. For me, the most obvious need for consolidation is between Project, Visual Studio, and Team Foundation Server (also known as TFS). Project is what it sounds like - a project management, collaboration, and efficiency vehicle for general workflow. Visual Studio, in general - inclusive of Visual Studio, Visual Studio Online, and Visual Studio Code, is a "development environment" for creating applications (Windows, Android, and iOS, web, cloud, etc.) that offers collaboration services and code editing capacity. It's a hugely useful, diverse use case platform as a stand-alone. Finally, TFS is a collaboration and lifecycle management platform for Visual Studio geared for development teams. Put simply, it's a development team optimized project manager. Now, an argument can be made for leaving these as-is and it would be a good one and I "get it". But the amount of capabilities crossover between the three of these is substantial and having an entire enterprise on one platform to me makes a whole lot more sense if the endpoint goal is to make Microsoft's SMB/enterprise "suite" the foundational platform in existence. By the way, this is clearly stated as Microsoft's goal. I recently heard the argument from somebody that I trust in regards to the space that developers don't want to use the same platform that could be used to plan a wedding (his example), and Project can be used for cases like that whereas Visual Studio can't, but couldn't Visual Studio be an optional add-on within Project? I mean, I just don't see how it makes sense to have different teams within one organization using different platforms. Simply from a communication and collaboration standpoint that doesn't make sense. Different teams within an enterprise will be using different terminology - it just creates a barrier to both that I don't think needs to exist. It also creates an excuse to use a non-Microsoft platform - think Intellinote or Slack . There's also the fact that quite possibly the best project/product management solution, the company would be appalled if they knew I referred to them as a "project" company rather than product, in the entire SMB/enterprise space is integrated with TFS but not Project. I'm referring to Aha ! and yes I'm serious - it's integrated into the much lower use case TFS but not the crown jewel Project platform. Aha! is the only worthwhile project/product management solution I've used, Intellinote is right there but it's a project/collaboration management solution pure-play, and its trapped on the TFS platform. Aha! is a company with over 10,000 customers, including marquee names Samsung, BBC, EA, Dell, etc., that Microsoft could presumably transition to Project with an integration - something that it has learned is an effective acquisition strategy for its Power BI and Power BI Designer platforms. This is what's confusing about Microsoft and maybe this is the reason they let four high level managers walk today. I mean how is it that this happens? How is it that TFS, and by way of intra-Microsoft platform integration Visual Studio (which TFS rolls up to), literally had to integrate Aha! as a way to optimize platform product management capacity (because as it stands currently nobody familiar with Aha! is going to use TFS for product management - they're simply going to use Aha! as an integration) but nobody communicated this gem to the guys at Project? It's all very confusing. Project/Visual Studio/TFS employees, take it from the Power BI and the Power BI Designer guys - talk to each other. You'll be better off for it. So, if Microsoft wants to start axing something it should start with silos separating its core products on the SMB/enterprise solution side - not managers. Remove the silos, stop creating unnecessary use friction and reasons to use non-Microsoft platforms, and make it easier to be the foundational productivity suite in the space.
