Apple: The Key Trend Remains Intact - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple's stock price has followed the EPS trend over the last five years and is set up to continue that process. Currency and inventory headwinds won't last, while the stock buyback tailwind remains intact despite nagging domestic cash issues. While the market debates whether China is about to roll over and cause heart burn for iPhone sales or if the rollout of the Watch met expectations, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) continues to show positive numbers for the all-important earnings trend. The key with Apple is that investors tend to over stress lots of product and sales trends and end up missing the big picture. In the article " Apple: Focus On This Trend, " it was pointed out how nothing really matters for the stock outside of the direction of the EPS number. The stock initially sold off big time following the FQ3 earnings report before a rebound that still left it down for the week after the report. Not to mention, the stock has now failed three attempts to break above the key $132 level. The market is nervous about the stock as always, but did the FQ3 report negatively alter the key EPS trend? The quarterly numbers have already been hashed and rehashed, but the simple truth is that the reported EPS beat estimates. Apple earned $1.85 per share vs. expectations of only $1.81. Revenue guidance for FQ4 was weak compared to analyst estimates, but the numbers were positive vs. the just reported FQ3 numbers suggesting a increase in EPS estimates for this quarter. In the article about a month ago, Apple was scheduled to make only $9.00 this year and $9.71 next year. Based on the FQ3 numbers and guidance, the numbers are up to $9.12 and $9.75, respectively. As highlighted in the original article, a growing EPS trend is key to Apple heading higher. The hope of new products or cheap PE ratios doesn't push the stock like a higher EPS. Hence the talk about the Watch and Apple Pay doesn't really matter, while currency issues and stock buybacks strongly impact actual EPS numbers. Based on the chart below, Apple trades with the EPS trends of analyst projections. The stock has struggled for a few months, but the EPS trend continues heading higher. The selloff in 2012 preceded a sizable decline in EPS estimates. At this point, the question is still a matter of how much growth is possible. The debate very much centers on whether Apple Pay or the Watch will contribute significantly to growth or the possibility of iOS9 rejuvenating iPad sales. The situation is nowhere near the concern in 2012 that Samsung (OTC: SSNLF ) was about to eat Apple's lunch in the smartphone sector. As the data above shows, the EPS trend will continue heading up into 2016 with estimates of Apple earning $9.75 per share. The stock buyback continues to provide a stealth tailwind for Apple. The question is whether it will continue in that fashion to the extent hoped by the market. During the last quarter, Apple invested $13 billion in capital returns including an accelerated stock repurchase plan. Unfortunately, the tech giant is running out of domestic cash for the buyback. The cash balance jumped to $203 billion, but the offshore portion is now 89% or $181 billion. The debt portion is now up to $50 billion. The hope of large scale buybacks are increasingly difficult due to the requirement to borrow large sums of cash in order to execute them. The Carl Icahn plan may be difficult to implement without hiring a whole department of accountants to manage the increasing cash balances and growing debt load. Part of the issue with the 2012 collapse was the stock faced increasing share counts that provided a headwind to EPS growth. Now, Apple has the benefit of huge outstanding share reductions to boost EPS numbers. Based on the chart below, Apple is now approaching the removal of one billion shares from the outstanding share count. Naturally, the current-year estimates continue to increase after the $0.04 beat for the last quarter, but the numbers for next year appear to be hitting a plateau. The key though is that a 5% reduced share count for FY16 will provide a gigantic $0.46 boost to the EPS estimate. Without doing anything but repeating the projected FY15 EPS of $9.12 and reducing the share count by 5%, Apple earns $9.58 next year. As simple as that, the positive EPS trend will stay intact. Investors are rightfully concerned about the iPhone missing sales projections and the Watch not hitting the high-end targets of four million units sold during the quarter. Ultimately though, the stock movement is based on the EPS direction that includes so many factors outside of units sold or removed from inventory. Apple remains an extremely profitable company trading at an attractive valuation. With the EPS trend continuing in an upward direction, investors should use the current dip to add to any positions instead of running away from the stock.
