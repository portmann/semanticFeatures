AT&T's Deal Structure For DirecTV Adds One More Reason To Buy It Over Verizon - AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) | Seeking Alpha To screen ETFs by asset class, performance, yield and more, check out the ETF Hub. ETF Hub AT&T announced a $17.5 billion bond offering to finish the acquisition of DTV, bringing its debt total closer to VZ. Despite the higher debt, AT&T will be gaining more with DTV than some investors realize, specifically free cash flow growth. With a higher dividend, expansion opportunities in Mexico and Latin America, and higher FCF, AT&T is the better investment of the two. One of my big arguments for why AT&T (NYSE: T ) is a far superior dividend investment than Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) centered around debt. Verizon had $30 billion more debt on its balance sheet than AT&T. However, that gap is closing fast, as AT&T recently announced a $17.5 billion bond offering to help fund the acquisition of DirecTV (NASDAQ: DTV ). While Verizon investors are taking to Twitter, message boards, and Seeking Alpha to praise Verizon's high free cash flow relative to its dividend, implying it is the superior dividend stock, there's still one piece of information that's being left out. What's forgotten is that AT&T is about to gain an asset that will in fact increase its free cash flow, substantially. Over the last year, DirecTV has created $3.1 billion in free cash flow. Once acquired, DirecTV's FCF will increase AT&T's total by more than 30%. Importantly, that benefit is the result of combining each company's 12-month free cash flow. It does not account for cost synergies. AT&T recently announced that it expects $2.5 billion in savings by the end of the third year post acquisition. In other words, the immediate increase to FCF after AT&T acquires DirecTV could be 40%, and should result in FCF growth in excess of 50% by 2018. Not to mention, the acquisition will be combining two companies that have seen significant FCF growth over the last 10 years. As seen below, AT&T's FCF has increased nearly 70% and DirecTV's almost 220%. This gives reason to believe that long-term free cash flow growth should be even higher than the expected cost synergies that AT&T estimates. T Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YCharts The bottom line is that AT&T will actually gain something of measurable impact to its bottom line whereas Verizon spent $130 billion, doubled its debt, and increased its share count 50% to acquire a Wireless stake that has had no real impact to its free cash flow. Verizon's free cash flow has actually declined over the last five years despite the enormous price it paid to take full control of its Wireless business. While the wireless price war, higher CapEx, and lower margins are most certainly to blame, it does seem like Verizon wasted an unprecedented amount of money gauging by the chart below. VZ Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YCharts As of now, AT&T's free cash flow is just enough to make its dividend payments. That's a problem, as typically investors like to see a company able to make dividend payments with cash left over. However, the acquisition of DirecTV will improve that situation. As stated, AT&T will get a 40% improvement to FCF short term, much more long term, and diluting its stock by less than $35 billion to do so. In other words, a 40% improvement to FCF in exchange for a 19% increase in share count. That's a good acquisition, one that should make AT&T's dividend much more affordable while it is investing in Mexico and Latin America to expand its network coverage area and find long term growth opportunities. In a nutshell, the acquisition of DirecTV is yet one more reason that AT&T is better than Verizon.
