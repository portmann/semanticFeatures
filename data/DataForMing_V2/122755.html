Yahoo: Negative Valuation On Digital Asset? Really? - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha Yahoo reports on Tuesday, with consensus expecting $0.18 EPS and $1.03b in revenue. Fantasy sports could be a $1b call option for the company's digital asset. Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) will report on Tuesday, with consensus expecting $0.18 in EPS and $1.03b in revenue, flat relative to the prior year. Heading into the quarter, investors will see more clarity regarding the Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) asset. On Friday, YHOO announced that it will spin off its BABA stake into a new entity called Aabaco. YHOO shareholders will hold 384m shares of BABA. At the end of Friday, that stake is worth $32b. Investors are positive on this plan, as it is a tax-free spin-off, but I caution that IRS approval is no guarantee at this stage, and more clarity is needed on Tuesday's call. Looking at the core business, the value of BABA stake implies YHOO's core business to be valued at negative $5b as of Friday's close, and I do not believe this is to be the case. First, YHOO's entry into daily fantasy sports is the right strategic move, given its track record in fantasy sports. In my view, YHOO's fantasy sports asset could be a $1b call option alone, given the recent round by FanDuel, which raised $275m to value the company at $1.3b. Judging by the growth of FanDuel and DraftKings, I expect YHOO's fantasy sports to be equally successful as YHOO leverages its fantasy player base. While I acknowledge that the daily fantasy sports industry has been bubbly over the past several months with hundreds of startups, there are an estimated over 40m fantasy sports participants in North America, and FanDuel and DraftKings only account for 5% of the total user base, implying plenty of room for YHOO. Regarding YHOO's other digital assets, its mobile MAU reached 600m - an increase of 20% y/y - which I consider to be quite impressive. Tumblr's MAU could surpass 500m this quarter and generate $100m in revenue this year, so there is certainly value in YHOO's traditional ad business. Finally, video will continue to benefit from the trend of ad dollar shifting from TV to online. YHOO have also invested in more original and third-party video contents to the platform, and this could further accelerate ad revenue growth. In conclusion, I remain bullish on YHOO. The Alibaba asset provides an attractive floor to the share price, while the digital asset remains an attractive call option. Source: Yahoo: Negative Valuation On Digital Asset? Really?
