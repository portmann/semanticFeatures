Is Yahoo A Better Investment Than Alibaba Right Now? - Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) | Seeking Alpha To screen ETFs by asset class, performance, yield and more, check out the ETF Hub. ETF Hub MS analysis of YHOO was flawed in one way. Is YHOO's underlying business worth anything at all? Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ) recently said that Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) offers investors a 20% discount on Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) shares. While the math makes perfect sense , the wildcard is how much Yahoo's underlying business is worth after the spinoff is complete. In looking at Yahoo's sum of parts, and its methods to increase shareholder value, would investors really be best served dropping Alibaba and buying Yahoo right now? The one thing I didn't like with Morgan Stanley's analysis is that it used next year's EPS estimates to find a valuation for Yahoo's Alibaba stake. I consider this a flaw. As all know, estimates are just that, so in this case I think it is best to look at the value of SpinCo based on trailing 12 month earnings. Alibaba has created $4.31 billion in net income over the last 12 months, meaning it trades at 48.8x net income. Yahoo owns a 15% stake of Alibaba, worth $31.5 billion today, or 74.7% of its market capitalization. That equates to $33.69 per share, not the $38 a share that Morgan Stanley figures Yahoo's stake is worth. For $38 a share, Alibaba would need to produce the accelerated earnings growth and higher stock price that Morgan Stanley notes, but at this very moment that is all speculative. Therefore, if the spinoff occurred today, Yahoo would be worth $10.7 billion minus Alibaba. The company then has a $7 billion cash position and an investment in Yahoo! Japan that's worth another $7 billion. This gives Yahoo's cash and investments excluding Alibaba a valuation of negative $3.3 billion based on its market capitalization excluding Alibaba. Furthemore, while Yahoo has consistently lost search and ad market share and has failed to grow revenue, it is still a business that generated revenue of $4.6 billion last year and is certainly worth something. That said, Yahoo's underlying business isn't worth much. What many investors fail to realize when looking at Yahoo is the money it creates from equity interests, mainly in Alibaba but also Yahoo! Japan. While its equity interest in Yahoo! Japan will exist following SpinCo, Yahoo will lose much of the money annually that it has received by owning stakes in these companies after SpinCo. In 2013 and 2014, Yahoo received nearly $900 million and over $1 billion from equity in affiliates, respectively. This greatly exceeded the near $590 million and $143 million it earned in operating income during 2013 and 2014, respectively. Granted, Yahoo's operating income did take a major step back last year due to the company spending an additional $300 million in SG&A and R&D combined. While those costs might decrease in 2015, it is hard to imagine Yahoo's operating margin exceeding 12% like it has in years past due to its CEO's aggressive spending policy. If we assume that Yahoo's underlying business's operating income and equity interest in Yahoo Japan will create profits of $300 million, then we could theoretically apply a market capitalization of $3 billion to Yahoo's underlying business with a conservative 10x multiple. That takes the valuation of Yahoo post SpinCo down to negative $6.3 billion at its current price. In other words, Yahoo! is worth $48 billion based on this analysis, or $51.27. If Alibaba shares appreciate through the year, then Yahoo's value would increase as well. if Yahoo can drive operating income higher, its valuation would increase. Therefore, this analysis is not too dependent on the future, but rather what Yahoo is worth right now based on its sum of parts. In retrospect, Yahoo is trading at a 13.7% discount to Alibaba, meaning it is the better buy of the two. For that reason, I picked up some Yahoo shares on Friday, and soon plan to divest my Alibaba stake. Source: Is Yahoo A Better Investment Than Alibaba Right Now?
