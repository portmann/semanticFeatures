Hedge Funds Maintain And Initiate Big Positions In Netflix - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Analysts bullish on company and raising target prices. Several hedge funds have large positions in the company. Netflix shares (NASDAQ: NFLX ) are on the verge of a stock split as they approach the $700 mark and have appreciated close to 100% in 2015 alone. Needham analyst, Laura Martin, recently upped her Netflix price target to $780 believing that Netflix's international subscribers could be two or three times more profitable for the company compared to its U.S. ones. UBS also raised its price target for Netflix shares to $722. Few analysts are bearish on Netflix as there are sixteen buy recommendations on the stock and eight outperform ratings according to S&P Capital IQ. Twelve analysts have hold recommendations, while two have underperform ratings and another two have sell ratings. In aggregate, Netflix carries an outperform rating considering all of the analyst ratings. In addition to analysts, hedge funds are largely bullish on Netflix with growing stakes in the company. Carl Icahn maintains his position in the company's shares from his previous filing at a value of $588.3 million, but funds like SRS, Matrix Capital, Tybourne Capital, and JAT Capital have increased their stakes. SRS increased its position in Netflix shares by 400% to $312.5 million, Tybourne by 23% to $133.2 million, and JAT by 10% $118.2 million. Coatue Mangement, led by Phillippe Laffont, has the largest position in Netflix shares with a value of $734.7 million, a slight 2% decrease from its previous position but still making up a large portion of its portfolio at 7%. Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group also had a position in Netflix with a $246.8 million call position and a $305.6 million put position. The call option position was an increase of 6% from its previous filing and its put position grew by 16%. Citadel's overall position is likely a move to benefit from volatility in Netflix shares and benefit from either a large rise or drop in Netflix shares as the hedge fund had decreased both positions in its filings at the beginning of 2015 before increasing them. The top ten hedge fund positions in Netflix were rounded out by Lansdowne Partners and D. E. Shaw. Lansdowne had a $241.7 million position even after decreasing it by 12%. D. E. Shaw still maintained a $238.7 million position after reducing its stake by 41% from its previous filings. These reductions are likely profit taking as Netflix shares have almost doubled in 2015 as previously mentioned. Regardless of whether an investor is long or short in the shares or other securities of Netflix, tracking hedge funds can help the everyday investor. Through our research we discovered that a portfolio of the 15 most popular small-cap picks of hedge funds beat the S&P 500 Total Return Index by nearly a percentage point per month on average between 1999 and 2012. On the other hand the most popular large-cap picks of hedge funds underperformed the same index by seven basis points per month during the same period. This is likely a surprise to many investors, who think of small-caps as risky, unpredictable stocks and put more faith in large-cap stocks. In forward tests since August 2012 these top small-cap stocks beat the market by an impressive 84 percentage points, returning over 142%. Hence a retail investor needs to isolate himself from the herd, avoid excessive fees, and take advantage of the best growth opportunities in the market by concentrating on small-cap stocks, the best ideas of the best fund managers in the world. The coming stock split could slightly boost Netflix shares and add a small liquidity premium to the shares as they become more obtainable for everyday investors and positions can be more easily wound down or ramped up. The stock trades at a hefty premium on many valuation metrics, but successful expansion overseas could allow the company to grow into its valuation. In the meantime, analysts and hedge funds remain largely bullish on the company and this will likely buoy the stock's price and help it appreciate some in the short-term. If possible, investors would probably be best served by initiating some sort of hedged position in Netflix like Citadel to mitigate any wild swings in the stock on either the positive or negative side in the coming months.
