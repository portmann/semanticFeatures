ETF Hub May 22 2015, 18:50 ET | About: Intel Corporation (INTC) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor Slides leaked by a Chinese site Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) plans to launch the first CPUs for its 14nm Skylake platform (successor to the current-gen/14nm Broadwell line) in August/September, and gradually flesh out its Skylake lineup over the following 4-5 months. Intel has said Skylake will launch in 2H15. Desktop Skylake chips codenamed Skylake-S will reportedly arrive in August and September - with Intel skewing its Broadwell launches towards notebooks and tablet s, some PC OEMs are opting to pass on launching desktop Broadwell parts and wait for Skylake. Reportedly due in September: High-end notebook CPUs (Skylake-H), mainstream notebook CPUs (Skylake-U), and ultrabook/tablet CPUs (Skylake-Y). Additional Skylake-H parts are said to be due in October/November, and additional Skylake-U/Y parts in January. Whereas Broadwell prioritized lowering power draw and enabling new form factors (see Apple's 12" retina MacBook ), Broadwell appears to emphasize CPU/GPU performance gains as much as power savings. The PC industry is counting on Skylake and Windows 10 to spark a 2H15 rebound following a rough start to the year. Separately, Digitimes reports Intel and Chinese mobile SoC partner Rockchip have stepped up their efforts to sell Rockchip's 3G Atom SoC (part of the SoFIA line, launched in March ) to white-box Chinese tablet makers. As part of the effort, Intel is said to be offering a $3 subsidy for each device using the chip. 7" tablets using the Rockchip SoC reportedly wholesale for just $45. With the help of generous marketing subsidies, Intel shipped 46M tablet CPUs last year, beating a goal of 40M. Correct. That should say Skylake rather than Broadwell... Broadwell was the shrink that improved power efficiency, Skylake is the redesign. Tick tock.
