Apple Bond Issuance Shows Potential Market Problem | Seeking Alpha U.S. Treasury yields have been on the rise. Apple coupon rates jumped significantly in just three months. In recent weeks, we have seen U.S. Treasury yields rise a bit, especially on the long end of the curve. In the chart below, you can see the sharp rise in the 30-Year yield, especially since early February. The iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NYSEARCA: TLT ) has dropped a lot recently, because bond prices fall as yields rise. One area where this comes into play is in regards to Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). The company recently issued more debt to fuel its giant capital return plan. However, Apple was forced to pay much higher interest rates than just a few months earlier. In this article, I detail how this can be a problem for Apple as well as the overall market. Apple is a big part of both the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSEARCA: DIA ), and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA: SPY ). Apple announced a large increase to its capital return plan a few weeks ago, and to accomplish this plan, the company has been accessing the debt markets. This past week, Apple took out another $8 billion in debt, with maturities ranging from 2 to 30 years. Unfortunately for the company, the recent rise in rates did result in the company paying a bit more than when debt was taken out back in early February . In the table below, you can see a comparison of the similar debt issues from these two transactions. There are a few items to consider here. First, Apple is paying a bit more in interest costs. For the 5-year issue, an extra 45 basis points on $1.25 billion in debt means an extra $5.625 million in annual interest expenses, pre-tax. Just on these four issues, cutting down the 10-year issue in May to the same $1.5 billion size as the February issue, Apple will be hit with an additional $41.5 million in annual pre-tax interest costs. The coupon rates Apple got on the May 2015 issues were 25-30% higher than the February 2015 ones. Another thing to think about is Apple's dividend. When companies buy back shares using debt, one item considered is saving dividend payments. If your after-tax interest costs are less than your annual yield, there is a cash flow savings. Unfortunately, Apple's dividend yield was just 1.63% as of Friday's close, so some of this higher rate debt does not achieve this cash flow savings at this point. Apple has been one of the best performing stocks over the past year. While that is good for investors that have held the name, it does make the buyback a little less effective for a given dollar amount. In the chart below, you can see how Apple's open market purchases have been at significantly increasing prices in the last six fiscal quarters. While management and the board remain confident in Apple shares enough to boost the company's capital return plan, the rise in interest rates is a troubling thought. If this recent trend continues, management might start to think twice about adding more long-term debt. Perhaps the argument for repatriation will start again, given the massive overseas cash pile. Apple shares have also rallied significantly in recent quarters, so the buyback will have a tougher time getting the share count down. In the end, Apple's recent debt issuance could show a potential problem for the market. Obviously, rising interest rates are a concern for certain areas of the economy, like the housing market. My focus is on capital return plans, however, and rising rates make debt for buyback arguments a bit tougher. If interest rates continue to rise, companies may start to slow down their share repurchase plans, or find alternate ways to fund them. Apple may be the world's leading company at the moment, but it is not immune to a sharp rise in interest rates. This could be the start of a bigger problem for the overall market.
