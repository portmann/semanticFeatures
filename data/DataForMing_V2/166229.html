Intel Corporation's (INTC) Management Presents at Citi 2015 Global Technology Conference (Transcript) | Seeking Alpha Christopher Danely - Citigroup Global Markets A company that needs no introduction, but I’m going to give you one anyway because that’s the kind of guy I am, is Intel. You all know them as the largest and most profitable semiconductor company out there. They generate anywhere from 15% to 20% of the total revenue in the entire semiconductor industry year-after-year. We all know them as a company that dominates the PC processors and server processors. But they are also looking to dominate the processors in your phone, in your tablet; they are getting in to foundry, getting in to programmable logic, all kinds of interesting things there. So here to talk about it is Kirk Skaugen, who is the Senior VP and General Manager of the Client Computing Group. Kirk’s going to have a short presentation and then we’ll jump in to Q&A. And that will be over to Kirk. Thank you. I appreciate the invite this morning, and I am fresh back from Berlin at IFA Show, our largest consumer electronics show in Europe, where we launched the best product in Intel’s history. So it’s going to be a little exciting to tell you why I am excited about that. For about a decade I managed our Datacenter business, last two years or so I managed our PC business, and then in January we merged our modem, phone, tablet and client business, and that’s what I manage now, the Client Computing Group, which is Intel’s largest P&L. And the reason we merged it, is there’s just a large number of conversion happening right, big tablets, small tablets, 2-in-1s, Notebooks, and so we felt it best for efficiency and for our customer base to merge that. So our mission within the Client Computing Group is to empower the worlds with the best Client Computing experiences and what we’ve tried to do in the last two years is just deliver more innovation, particularly in to the PC space than we’ve ever had before. If you just look at the plethora of devices at the bottom compared to where we were at several years ago, and I think you’ll see just in simple things like color choice. I would contend that four or five years ago you could get a back Notebook, silver Notebook, may be a grey Notebook that wasn’t much of a personal computer for a lifestyle device. Now you can get devices in any color, shape imaginable. And it’s not on the Notebook side; it’s on the PC and desktop side as well. What I said on stage in Germany is that, this is a once in a decade moment for Intel. It’s probably only a couple of times that I’ve been in Intel 23 years, where you have a brand new operating system like Windows 10, combined with the best processor introduction in Intel’s history, which is 6th Generation Core, which we had codenamed Skylake. And it’s interesting because as we look at tablets and what’s happened with the tablet market; we did see a push-out of PC purchases. So what our research says time and time again is that those are traditionally companion devices and that people are still waiting for the time to refresh to another desktop or another Notebook. And so as you look at the installed base today, with this Windows 10, this new introduction you now have 1 billion PCs in the market that are over three years old and 0.5 billion PCs in the market that are four to five years old. And that’s just an enormous opportunity for refresh, before you even go after the first time buyer. And these PCs literally just won’t run a lot of the applications today, whether you like 4K content that’s coming online, whether you want a touchscreen, not to mention the security level is huge. So it’s a once in a lifetime opportunity. So why are we excited? If you just look at what you can refresh. Again I picked five-years old just because it’s half of that 0.5 billion. Half of that 1 billion, rather. 150 times faster processing performance, 30 times the graphics. And you know YouTube has now announced her 360 Video channel. People will think I’m crazy, but the new selfie sticks are actually 360 degree selfie sticks now. You can take video on 360, it won’t even run on a couple of year old PC, it won’t even run, and three times the battery life. So literally 10 hours across the ocean in full media playback, and something that’s probably half the weight and half in stint as the device you had. So to put it in perspective, the products we announced around Core M last week, two sometimes three times the performance of the biggest performance tablets in the world. Same kind of [see height] or thickness, same kind of weight. And we had unprecedented designs. So more than 800 designs, system designs are coming to market. It’s probably hard to put it in perspective without a denominator on there, but that is absolutely unprecedented from us. 48 different processors are launching across every form factor you can imagine. So it’s a big, big deal. In addition for those of you who track our datacenter business, you know that Xeon’s been relatively successful for us from a margin perspective. We also announced the first Xeon for Notebook. So what in the world would I use Xeon for Notebook? Well workstation is a multi-billion dollar business for us on the Tower side. In a Notebook computer, under six pounds now, you can get the same performance of what you had three years ago in a 61 pound Tower. So 1/10th the weight; you can now carry your workstation to you on the site and we are going to get our selling prices significantly higher, obviously small volume but a good opportunity for margin there for us. One of the things that we’re excited about is the 2-in-1 category. So saw IDC set the 2-in-1 which some people said is it a toaster and a refrigerator trying to be put together. It turns out, people actually like these devices. So it was the best of a Notebook and the best of a tablet in one device. And yes the original ones were may be a little bit clunky, three-four years ago. This is the first product with Skylake our 6th Generation Core we designed grounds up for 2-in-1s. And we have now five quarters of data back, thousands of people serving on retail or exit data that says why or who’s buying these 2-in-1s. So first of all 56% on the people that leave the store that bought a 2-in-1. So here’s an example of a 6th Generation Core 2-in-1, has a super nice keyboard on it. But very simply it’s detached. Imagine some of this, two to three times the performance of the highest performing tablets out there, but 7.9 millimeter or 780 grams and 8.9 millimeters. So incredibly thin and this is Lenovo mix. By the way it has a new world facing 3D camera in the back, a real sense technology where you can now scan a room and we are working with Google on Tango; their Tango project where we’re going to do indoor mapping. Just like you do street maps, you can do indoor mapping, you can scan your face in and actually put it on social media site. It’s going to revolutionize blind dating effort or you can get a 360 selfie of yourself. You can scan in your face; put it in to a video game. We announced with Electronic Arts your next generation video games; you can put your face in to the video game and be your favorite character. So whether it’s detachable like this or this is the new Toshiba, incredibly thin, an amazing 4K screen. Everything you’d love in a clamshell, but a full performance of your highest end PC, and of course you can just flip around as a tablet. So what we are seeing is this is now the second fastest growing category in mobile after phablets, and we’re seeing for those that are buying this class of device we are seeing an 8-12 months refresh pulling. So if it took you x number of years to buy a PC, people are buying these out of want versus need. So they are actually coming in with a store earlier, not because their screen broke or their hard drive is bad or because they want to buy a device like this; fully touchscreen that type of thing. And you can see here, this is our North American retail data. You can basically see here, without 2-in-1s the Notebook market is down, with 2-in-1s, the Notebook market has had a pretty good success from a consumer perspective here, and you are going to start seeing these in to our business class PCs with vPro and all the security and management there will be. Not to leave out desktop, a couple of interesting things about desktop. This is more than a $10 billion business for Intel, desktops. And we are refreshing everything across the line from 91 high-end gaming Towers. We like gamers because believe it or not there’s 1.8 billion people that game in the world. 1.2 billion of the 1.8 are PC gamers. And in 2012 the software revenue of PC gaming crossed console gaming and it’s never going back. And 711 million people in the world consider themselves an active PC gamer. That means they buy a PC game once a month. To put it in perspective, we have something called Intel Extreme Master; it’s like the Olympics of gaming. We are putting 40,000-50,000 people in to gaming stadiums. There’s a rumor in China of building the world’s first gaming stadium with 65 million people on Twitch following Intel Extreme Master. 850,000 people showed up to watch it live. And these people are refreshing their PCs every two to three years versus every five years plus. So that’s on the gaming side. On the computer stick side now on something the size of a USB stick, you can plug this in to the back of a monitor and you can get basically a full PC experience, full Core PC experience. So small doesn’t need to be cheap. You can plug this in to the back of a point-of-sale terminal, a kiosk, a social vending machine, a robot, a drone or a monitor and you can get a full PC experience now with this computer stick, and we are selling those preloaded with Windows and Linux on them now. So the other part of my business is phone, tablet and modem. So we have four strategies in our mobility business separate from the PC side. The first is we are building a very strong IT portfolio. We just launched our first Atom x3 processors this year that were announced at Mobile World Congress. This is first time we’ve put a processor and an SoC, [comps] in a SoC. So we have 3G versions and LTE versions coming. We’ve committed to be one of the industry leaders in 5G, as we move forward and we think forward we are in a unique position because we have the datacenter, communications and infrastructure business all the way down to the chip with a new Cloud and chip kinds of things there. From mobile devices to street silicon, whether it’s LTE or now their number one leader in PC Wi-Fi, back to a number one position relative to our competitors there, and we launched our first WiGig silicon for docking which I will talk about in a second. Plan is to compete profitably in mobile segments. We are one back to Surface portfolio from ARM on the low ends, we are now in both Surface Pro 3 as well as the Surface, and then we’ve partnered with two important Chinese vendors Rockchip and Spreadtrum to build proliferations. So as we compete with that plethora of products out there from tables and phones, we can have a broad portfolio of products with our partners on Rockchip and Spreadtrum. And then last, before Q&A, I have been chatting about new experiences or new use experiences now for the last several years in the 6th Generation Core product line about absolutely starting to bring some of this to fruition. So very simply put, Intel’s on a mission, as we look at 50,000 consumers and about 800 concepts every year. There’s three things arise at the top of things that are pink points for user. Number one is we want to eliminate all wires from computing. Second is we want to eliminate all passwords from computing? And the third is we want to move people to more natural ways to interact versus a keyboard and mouse, particularly with voice and with gesture. How we monetize that it’s a little bit different. Usually is refresh, getting people to want to buy a new computing device versus needing to buy a new computing device, and then now wire space, we need to eliminate the wires for data transfer like USB cables; docking, the $150 you buy for a dock; for display, wirelessly displaying; and for charging. So we are able to do now on 6th Generation Core as we’ve eliminated, we have LTE going in to a larger number of PCs and tablets. We have launched our first WiGig silicon. So there’s Intel silicon now for wireless docking where we can literally just drop your tablet down and it connects to your monitor wirelessly and all your peripherals. We’ve launched WiDi, which is wireless display whether you go in to your conference room on in to your TV at home, you can just wirelessly display on to the screen seamlessly. And we have an initiative going on wireless charging. So guess is by end of ’16, we’d be able wirelessly charge your PC, very similar to how you can do your phone, except in a more seamless way with magnetic resins technology versus inductive technology. And all that means is you are going to get spacial freedom, you can put a transmitter, a charging transmitter underneath your table or your kitchen countertop or in the bar in the hotel and it will transmit through two inches of wood without having to actually drill holes in tables. So very fast implementation, and we are already seeing that in cars and Starbucks and this kind of things happening already. And now passwords; we have an initiative with Microsoft. I can confidently say today, you can eliminate all your passwords today if you buy a 6th Generation Core system. And you do that two ways; by an Intel RealSense camera enabled PC that has this security of 3D facial login. So it actually measures, you can do everything from measure blood pressure, blink detection, all these kinds of things. We’ve worked with Microsoft on a spec for Windows 10, so on Windows Hello as part of Windows 10 you look in your face it will log you. And in fact in Berlin one of my funniest demos in my 23 years in Intel is I brought two identical twins out on stage and I mixed them up and only one could log in with the PC, and it actually worked, so it was better. That was the good part. Once you’ve logged in with Windows 10, Intel with our McAfee acquisition has something called True Key, and what True Key did wants you to do is with that face you log in to all your other websites. So we handed off from Microsoft. So you can eliminate passwords now and in the future. So we are doing that to obviously pull in PCs especially the new camera and we needed Windows 10 to be able eliminate those passwords. And then Natural User Interfaces, we are doing two things; we are fully supporting Dragon Assistant and iFly Tek for voice recognition. If anyone used an Amazon Echo, you’ll understand this is coming soon to a kitchen near you, right. What’s the weather, what’s the stock price, order me some diapers, order my child some diapers. But talking to your PC or talking to a device that’s in your kitchen is very natural and you’re putting things like dual-array microphones and so why buy a new PC and Windows 10 because Cortana requires two ears, dual-array microphones need new hardware. Two ears versus one ear on the new PCs. And then real sense cameras for designing two real sense cameras, one is for user facing for things like secure login, for gesture, 3D facial scan for your social media sites. We have games that now can measure your motion if you start getting high anxiety it either slow down or make the game faster. The more higher anxiety can throw more zombies at you. So that’s for the user facing camera. For the world’s facing camera we’ll do things like 3D facial capture. Imagine inside of every place in the world is captured in 3D. Just like you have street maps outside for Google, we’re going to have a world very soon that is completely mapped in 3D with these cameras. So we are basically putting eyes and ears on every device out there with a goal of pulling that in. So that’s all I have. So quick snapshots of Client Computing Group, phone, tables, modems, wireless connectivity like Wi-Fi, WiGig and PC. I think more innovation we’ve had in the last several years and here in a unique moment of time we’ll talk about it with Chris, but I am relatively bullish. My job in Intel is to grow PC, not see it be flat which is kind of our general public statement, and I can tell you in the Q&A why I am confident with that. So thank you very much. Q - Christopher Danely - Citigroup Global Markets Hey thanks Kirk and thanks for coming. So I can go out predict that Notepad’s for an upgrade cycle here any day now, makes me want to get a new PC. I guess before we dig in to what’s happening now let’s just maybe we take a step back in hindsight. Why do you think PCs were so strong last year and then we’ve really had some issues with PC demand this year? I think obviously we had a great XP refresh cycle last year with Microsoft which was part of it, as the XP and the way it happened. I am bullish on PC growth this year and in the future for a number of reasons. I think a lot of people didn’t realize that we’ve had five consecutive quarters with Notebook growth other than the second quarter, and that’s despite three of our top five markets, which was Japan, Russia and Brazil being down 20% to 40% plus. And I won’t predict macroeconomics, but those markets will come back and UPCs will come back. As we phablets in smaller screen sizes happen, the requirement for a larger screen size device I think does grow and so I think that’s actually helping us is that when 10 inch tablets went to 8 inch, 7 inch tablets and now down to 6 inch tablets, that’s making a room for the PC. Q2 was tougher for us just because of Windows 10. People were leaning down their inventory on Windows 8, getting ready for Windows 10. So we are expecting a slightly better than seasonal or high-end to seasonal for the second half now. But there are some real gems under there that I don’t think people realize, like for example, I mentioned desktops more than a $10 billion business for Intel. We didn’t build a next generation core product our last product for Towers. We made an experiment and we said maybe we are putting technology in to the market too fast, but let’s not build a chip for the mainstream Tower business, more than a $10 billion business. Turns out that was a mistake. It saved us some R&D, but x the end of life and then there was no reason to buy a PC this year. So it’s just pent up demand now. I think for 6th Generation Core as well. Christopher Danely - Citigroup Global Markets We’ve seen some softness in the economy over the last few months. How much do you think the overall economy drives PCs versus what you are doing or Microsoft and most of the chain does? Well I think it used to be tightly coupled with GDP; I think we are starting to question that now for the last 18 months or so. I think what Intel’s taught me is when you innovate people will have money to buy. People are buying $699 smartphones in China right, just about talk to Huawei, Xiaomi, ZTE and these kind of things. So I think people have the money, it’s the innovation that I think these kind of devices bring, and the good news for us is that I think we did have a elongation of the Notebook buying cycle, but our data absolutely says that people want to refresh their Notebooks. So they just been wanting to know when and we honestly think it’s the time now based on the 6th Gen Core. Christopher Danely - Citigroup Global Markets So let’s talk about what’s new in Windows 10 that’s out, its available. You were just in Europe at the PC really a big tech gathering. What’s been the initial reaction, what are people really gravitating towards, what’s the first read on how folks like 110? I think we never had a closer collaboration with Microsoft than we’ve had on Windows 10. We’ve literally been working with them for four plus years putting the hardware and the software together. For whatever the reason, I’ve talk to a lot of people that don’t realize that there are hardware feature that the software sits on and relies on. And then there is system level features that we spec together that we go out and drive in to the industry. So if you look at Cortana for voice assistance, one of the new features you really need dual-array mic [summer] system to do that and we have special processing in our chips as well as the dual-array microphones that drive new hardware. If you look at Hello for Windows 10 facial login, you need a Intel RealSense camera in the vast majority of PCs to be able to login on Windows 10. If you look at the new games, we have special DX12 things in our graphic chips to make DX12 drivers great for digital rights management on PlayReady 3.0. So probably talk to 200-300 press in the last month getting ready for 6th Generation Core launch, I would say 99% of the press has been neutral to positive about Windows 10, which is another boom from my perspective, because there’s obviously a lot of money getting pumped in to the ecosystem from an advertising perspective. You see it every day on the TV as a result of that. Christopher Danely - Citigroup Global Markets And you talked about the Intel side Skylake new process architecture, is it out, is it not out, could you go to the store and buy, when is the availability and may be just talk about some of the new features that Skylake enables. I think we’ve been excited that our 5th Generation Core products as of July 29 were fully Windows 10 ready as well as our tablets, so we did a good job with Microsoft. 6th Generation Core system we shipped several million units in to the market place. We said that we’ll have Pentium Core i3, Core i5, Core i7 and that we put new levels on the Core M products, M3, M5, M7 all that will be out launched on shelf for holiday this year. The business launch for the high-end security with vPro. We are in production this year and case queue for gaming overclocking in production this year. So 40 nanometer is very healthy, its ramping. We are going to launch the business skews in January just because they want a one-year payments. But everything else is ramping and that’s why went and talk to even about Pentium and Celeron which are our value brands to show that we are going to bring Skylake and the 6th Generation Core down out very fast. So one thing that I think also may have gotten lost is, we’ve always said Core i3, i5, i7, good, better, best, very simple positioning to consumers. What we added now is Atom x3, x5, x7 under our Atom products, and then with Skylake I just added last week Core m3, m5 and m7. And this is just really good because it helps users buy up the stack which means higher selling prices for us and better value to consumers. The simplest way to describe it is, if you are buying a Tower desktop or a Notebook, you’ll want to buy just a Core i3, i5, i7 like you’ve always bought. If you buy a Core m, what you are basically getting is twice the performance of any tablet in the world with-it in a 2-in-1. So we are building Core m for the fastest family systems in the world, whereas Atom is kind of the brand that’s going to compete head-to-head with ARM. It will be better than ARM, but what Core m is is in a class by itself, so you can get these 2-in-1 form factors, no fan, more than twice the performance of any thing you can buy out there from Intel or anyone else and that’s why we created the m3, m5, m7 to be able to sell up. Christopher Danely - Citigroup Global Markets Great. We’ll ARM versus Atom in a second. So here comes the launch, you mentioned that Q2 is a little bit slower, there’s some inventory digestion. How do you guys feel about inventory in the channel right now? Do you think we’re passed all laterals or is there something? Yeah, I think we are seeing a comeback, nothing out of the ordinary which you would expect for getting the high-end of the season for the second half. So I think we did see a correction as we said in Q2 and its getting back to what you would expect for PC OEMs. Christopher Danely - Citigroup Global Markets Great. And then in terms of share I think record share from you guys and I want to say, you’ve gained more market share in the last two years than you had in the previous decade or something like that. So what do you think is going on that’s enabling your share gains to accelerate and is that a problem for Intel if AMD goes out of business? You guys are going slip in a few bucks out the back just to make sure they are still around or I joined the server business when we were getting beat by Opteron and the reality is that we had missed a few key strategic inflexion points at Intel and it took a couple of years to recover, and there is one thing about semiconductor is that you are innovating, you are going to gain share, and you are going to grow average selling prices and if you miss an innovation cycle or two, it’s pretty brutal. So I honestly feel that if you look at the innovation and color and style and they are just silly things it sounds like but they are like just watch Ben 10 now that they put on this and this colored gold is the gold of the season. I don’t know, my wife tells me that there’s certain colors of the season if you will, but this is the kind of style that’s coming in to Notebooks and PCs. So I think if you look at our [relative] dark competition we are winning because we are innovating and as a result we are gaining share. Christopher Danely - Citigroup Global Markets Your wife must from the east coast because I am from California, I don’t really see any changes in the season as far as colors go. Do you think you guys can keep it going when you are 99% sure in servers and I want to say somewhere in the low 90s in Notebooks, but there’s definitely some share to be gained down on the desktop side. But does Intel get worried that you might be gaining too much market share. Does that ever come up in discussions and do you think this will continue for the next couple of years. Well I think if you look at client computing alright, you are fighting for a dollar for a client and there’s a lot of people in China that have bought a smartphone that have never bought a PC. We consider that part of our total available market. So I think when I left server I thought we were at 90-92% share and now we are probably 96-97%. Christopher Danely - Citigroup Global Markets And then if you look at Notebooks and desktops, I think there’s still room to grow and certainly in tablets depending on how large you think the tablet market is worried about 15% share with the tablets we shipped last year. Phones, we have a significant amount of room to grow certainly in modems as well. So I would say, folks like Qualcomm probably occupy our minds more than AMD these days, but we are paranoid about our (inaudible). Christopher Danely - Citigroup Global Markets So let’s talk about ARM, you mentioned that early on versus Atom. We’ll start with ARM and just desktop and Notebook PCs, what are thoughts, do you think we are going to start to see ARM processors, there’s all these press reports they keep popping up that Apple’s going to try and slip some ARM processor in to a Mac or something like that. What are your thoughts there? I think our position in Core is pretty strong. I would say it’s very strong right now. It’s based on the performance levels we’ve been able to get and now with the fanless products or the Core M, we saw the new MacBook launch fanless on our new Core M product line. These products are both Core M fanless systems, so I feel very good about our Notebook position. Christopher Danely - Citigroup Global Markets Do you hear more about it now than you did three years ago or five years ago, or is it always been in the background there, may be you hear less about it now than you did a few years ago. I think Microsoft needs to speak for their terms and conditions of where they are licensing where elsewhere. But right now from a PC perspective, AMD is our main competitor and there are other big brands and consumer electronics out there that we would love to bring in to the PC space, and I am confident if they enter the PC space we’ll have them on Intel. Christopher Danely - Citigroup Global Markets So let’s shift gears a little bit to your old stomping ground, server. There’s a big push by ARM getting in to the server a few years ago and now Calxeda’s [bust] and AMD is getting out of it. You’ve got other companies like Cavium making a big deal and Qualcomm to a lesser extent. What are your thoughts on ARM and servers, do you think that we wake a year or six months from now and AWS or Google or Facebook or whatever has some sort of ARM server project or how does Intel view that? Well I think we’ve launched I think three generations of 64 bit servers with our Z and D product line, with the pending acquisition of Altera, we have the ability to deliver a purpose filled work load. And what I mean by that is, in the Cloud space, some of these customers buy may be 1 million servers a year, pretty crazy when you think about it. And they may have a very purpose filled workload that they want us to help accelerate. Now we have a solution there that we can have a purpose build product for those customers. As far as I know there’s one 64-bit ARM server out there for the datacenter space. So you saw other people backing out of that space. So I think we’ve innovated, that was one the last things I did before I left servers is aggressively pursue Atom based servers, because we want to disrupt ourselves, it turns out it was a very, very small percentage of the market. But I wanted to go in to it, test the waters and then when people actually run it in their infrastructure they realize that Xeon’s is a pretty good purpose built product. Christopher Danely - Citigroup Global Markets That was the debutant right (inaudible). Before I keep going I just wanted to make sure anybody in the audience have any questions. Going once, going twice. Otherwise I have no problem keep drawn him out there. So the question was our progress in mobile has it been less than our expectations and what are our prospects there. So a few things, last year from a tablet perspective invested to grow share, became the number one merchant market of silicon in the tablet market. I publicly had said, we shipped 46 million tablets, about 44% of those were out of the China technology ecosystem. So that moment and now, we had shown you we had lost billions of dollars in there because that was basically more expensive to build the system around an Intel chip than it was to build it around an ARM chip. With the SoFia products or the Atom x3 and then the Cherry Trail or the Atom x5 and x7 now, we dramatically lower that. So we’ve proven to the world that we have a good performance. In fact our performance has been outstanding, our battery life is now competitive, our application compatibility with ARM is best-in-class. You will find some things on the Android store that don’ work on ARM, you will find some things on the Android store that don’t work on Intel as we fix those pretty quickly. Our manufacturing test time is now our world class in terms of test automation to get through the factory floors. So all that’s going well and as a result we are on track to meet our commitment, to be $800 million more profitable this year than we were last year in the business. That’s because we are delivering with SoFia more products. Second ship is the Rockchip and Spreadtrum relationships enable us to deliver proliferations in the first chips on the Atom x3 that we collaborated with Rockchip now are in the market, shipped millions of units to them and they are proliferating that through their channels in addition to our channels. And then on the phone, I think, this is an area where as we now build comps integration with Compute, we have the ability to go after more business. Most importantly short term is with our discreet modems because you want to find the partner that can help you get that modem qualified in hundreds and millions of units across the 100 plus countries in the world, across every service provider network in the world. Because Intel’s vision is, if its smart and connected, it’s best on Intel. So we view our future after acquiring Infineon, I just bought the Lantiq business a couple of months ago. If it consumers electricity, it’s going to get connected to wireless with the internet. We are as much a communications company as we are a computing company. And I think if you said 10 years ago we were going to be the largest graphics company in the world, people would have squinted. I think we are one of the largest communications companies and the one thing I can tell you is absolutely people want choice. That’s the one thing since I took over the comp side of the business in January is people are really wanting Intel to be successful in 3G and LTE and 5G communications. And so this is our first four array of building integrated comps and compute silicon, and that’s what we need to do next is go after some big wins, right. We’ve had Lenovo, we’ve had Asus. You can go to Wal-Mart, Target, Amazon in the US and get it to Asus Zenfone 2 now for the first ever on the AT&T Network that wasn’t true a year ago. So we are making progress, but it’s a journey. Like most important thing is for me to stand up in front of you and say, we are much a communications company as a computing company as we get in to the IoT, Internet of Things, $50 billion devices by 2020, wearable technology, and we have some significant relationships with wearable right with Fossil, who does Michael Kors and Diesel with Oakley, with Tech Joy. Christopher Danely - Citigroup Global Markets Kirk as a follow-up to that, may be just talk about the Altera acquisition, biggest acquisition in the company’s history. Does this signal a shift to a little more focus on PLD and datacenter versus mobility as far as growth opportunities and where we would finally rank in there may be talk a little bit about that. I think it’s a great acquisition for both datacenter as well as Internet of Things, right. There’s things like autonomous driving, they need purpose built acceleration, that’s what Altera can be great at. As I mentioned in the Cloud, as we are on a journey to continue to grow the datacenter business on a 15% compound annual growth rate, we need purpose build accelerators for those Cloud customers that have very purpose build workloads that want something customized. So those were the two primary rationale behind that as to continue those businesses growing at kind of 15% compound annual growth rates. If I can stay flat, generally flat in the PC space, my job as the GM of the PC business is to do better than that and try to grow it low to mid-single digits unless the innovation is going to enable us to that. Christopher Danely - Citigroup Global Markets By the way after what happened this year in PCs has your long term growth forecast for PCs changed, have your thoughts changed on the long term growth of the PC market. Are you taking a step back on man may be this thing isn’t, it can’t be flat going poor or do you think it’s just a bit of an anomaly this year. Well I think the focus for PC is Macro will be come back. We are back to a yearly cadence on Tower desktop, just remember that, because it’s a $10 billion business, people forget about it, it’s not a sexy business, there’s towers but you’re on a yearly cadence versus the twice yearly cadence. I certainly believe that’s part of the slowdown. There are new, we just showed you that 2-in-1s are in 8 to 12 months pull-in on the traditional Notebook buyer, and then there’s some new markets for going in to Compute Sticks. We weren’t even in Compute Sticks a year ago. That has the ability to go everywhere. Things like we announced Unite at Computech. Unite is basically putting a PC in a conference room and you can connect anywhere you are connected to VPN in to the Unite box and display wirelessly in the conference room. So you could be sitting here right now, get a six digit pin and if there was a Unite box in your conference room, you can dial in to there. That’s total market expansion because there aren’t PCs in conference rooms today. Christopher Danely - Citigroup Global Markets You talked a little bit about how within in Notebooks, if we add in 2-in-1s actually the volumes are growing. But as we look at the rollout of your new Core M product line and we think about 2-in-1s expanding their share within that Notebook space, what will that mean for your ASPs and ultimately for your revenues. Without going in to a ton of detail, there are two things we are doing on pricing for 2-in-1s. For certain screen sizes we compete and we give competitive discounting to go compete with premium tablets. So traditionally in the smaller size detachables that are kind of a tablet first usage model where the screen detaches, we’ll give aggressive pricing. But if we win business over for example an iPad where we don’t have any silicon, that’s all positive revenue to Intel because we didn’t have that if it’s a conversion from an iPad over in a larger screen size, which is like a 13-15 inch conversion over our pricing is the same as it is on Core. So it’s just a trade-off the OEMs are making, do they want a thinner fanless system versus a thicker fan system, but we don’t have a difference in pricing there. So it will be the same --. So as I showed you on the graph 56% of the people that buy a product like this, so this is tablet first, so its every bit of a PC. It has got a hard keyboard, I would contend some of you out there are using Microsoft Surface user, similar kind of devices but it is tablet first, right. So it will wireless connectivity, its touch, its twice in performance of those premium tablets. So people are buying this and placing the tablet because they don’t have to carry two devices. And that’s what our data says is that more than half of the people would have walked out of the store with a premium tablet had they not bought a classic device like this. And so since we don’t have any silicon in a product like an iPad, when that buyer choses this class of device versus that, it’s obviously a positive revenue and units for us.
