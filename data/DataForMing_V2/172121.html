Netflix: Going Gangnam Style - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha NFLX is scheduled to launch in South Korea in early 2016, with Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore in the pipeline. Highest smartphone penetration and rising media consumption present a favorable backdrop. Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) is scheduled to launch in South Korea in early 2016 along with Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan in the pipelines, as the company looks to complete its global rollout and maintain the current subscriber growth profile amid a maturing market in North America. The stock has been down 20% as investors took profit after more than doubling their investment since the beginning of the year. Even with the recent sell-off, the stock is still up 20% YTD. Despite the recent sell-off, I am bullish on NFLX's long-term growth outlook as it focuses on its global expansion by partnering with local media companies overseas and making local programming the cornerstone of its global strategy. Additionally, Netflix's move into movie production could materially impact movie chains as recent releases can directly go OTT to the consumers on the opening day. I remain bullish on NFLX. With close to 60m subscribers in more than 50 countries, Asia remains a key geographic region for NFLX to drive its global strategy. With South Korea being the next target market after Japan (see - Netflix: Konichiwa Hastings-San ), I see meaningful growth prospects for NFLX in the country, given Koreans' higher media consumption relative to their global peers, highest smartphone penetration globally, and the company's ability to partner with local producers to create relevant content that can attract the domestic audience. Total media consumption in Korea has grown in recent years, driven by rising time spent on mobile devices. I note that time spent on smartphone has grown at a +29% CAGR over the past three years vs. PC which still grew at a respectable +18% CAGR over the same period. Interestingly, media consumption on traditional TV has stayed resilient, partially due to increasing usage of VoD services. I see these macro factors to present a favorable backdrop to NFLX entering South Korea. Unlike many OTT players, Netflix stands out, given its proven track record in producing quality content and leveraging its growing subs base to negotiate favorable contractual agreement with the content holders. Quality content is a key factor in driving traffic to NFLX, and South Korea is no different. That said, I expect Netflix to partner with local Korean companies to drive higher penetration. I note that the company has been aggressive in acquiring Japanese content as part of its Japan strategy and also working with Fuji TV in creating TV reality shows and co-producing variety shows with talent agency, Yoshimoto Kogyo. In Korea, I expect NFLX to partner with companies such as CDE&M, one of largest South Korean integrated media companies that cover broadcasting, movies, music and singers, as well as TV content producer such as SBS Media. There is also the potential of the company partnering with YG Entertainment, given its success in China and Japan, which could further strengthen its presence in those two countries. In short, I remain bullish on NFLX and expect Japan and Korea to deliver incremental upside in Q4 when the subscriber numbers start to ramp. In North America, I continue to see the company to be the key beneficiary of the cord cutting trend.
