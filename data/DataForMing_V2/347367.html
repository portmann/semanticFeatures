PayPal slips following a report Apple Pay is launching on mobile sites - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Mar 23 2016, 17:58 ET | About: Apple Inc. (AAPL) | By: Eric Jhonsa , SA News Editor Re/code reports Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has been telling companies Apple Pay will be available later this year on sites accessed via the Safari browser on iPhones/iPads containing a TouchID fingerprint sensor. It adds Apple has considered making the service available on sites accessed via Macs, but it isn't clear if the company will do so. Apple Pay already supports payments carried out via mobile apps, to go with its well-known support for NFC-based in-store payments. An announcement regarding mobile site support could occur during the annual WWDC conference (typically occurs in June). Online payments leader PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL ) is down 1.2% after hours to $40.03. PayPal handled $20B worth of mobile transactions last year (+45% Y/Y and 25% of total volume), and has seen its One Touch mobile payment solution (allows users to pay without re-entering their login or billing/payment info) adopted by over half of the top 500 online retailers. As Re/code notes, PayPal's Braintree unit provides back-end payment processing for some in-app Apple Pay purchases. But PayPal profits more if purchases are made via PayPal accounts. Aside from the size of its iOS base, favorable demographics make Apple a mobile payments threat: iOS users tend to be wealthier on average than Android users in a given market, and more likely to make purchases with their devices. Have had an iPhone since the beginning, still don't care to use Apple Pay. Additionally not sure why they assume customers would care to switch and use Apple Pay instead of PayPal. And what would make the commerce sites care to switch at this point. Not sure you should be commenting on it then if you've never bothered trying it. A thumb press (or double click on Watch) and done. I agree on e-commerce sites there is basically no difference, but if you visit physical stores with NFC regularly I suggest you try it. I tried connecting my discover card with no luck after that I was discouraged from using it further. Most people should realize like other commenters have mentioned, PayPal is used by business and consumer. Apple Pay would have a long way to play catch up, is only accessible to Apple users, and offers no reason to switch from PayPal services for existing customers. Too bad you didn't figure it out. Payment at a physical store with Apple Pay is so quick and easy and I curse each time I have to insert a credit card in the terminal. One day, cards will be out and you'll ask yourself what took you so long to get on to move to a phone based payment system. Regarding Paypall, not sure Apple's intent is to take Paypall down. It's more likely that Apple just wants to improve the usefulness of Apple Pay to its users. I agree apple just wants to offer users more features. However if I run into the store without my phone Apple Pay is useless. I often do this but that's just a personal thing. I don't believe PayPal shares should be down due to any Apple related news as I don't believe them to be a real threat to the business model. Just my thoughts. PayPal is a great business, I don't believe it's too richly valued due to its growth and 0 debt I think they have a great future and can swallow up the competition as it arises. its already half the size of visa in terms of market cap? Realistically how big can this get? it seems like the stock is selling at a premium already. good company but not convinced I want to pay $40 for this. Makes more sense at a 20-25PE. Small business use PayPal because there is a shipping label link, and in a few clicks you have a label for the item sold Well small sellers will continue to use PayPal PayPal is firmly intrenched in the minds of their customers and if a monster company like Apple can't knock them off their feet, who can? I am Apple user and I have been asking around how much of Apple Pay people use..I found out that out of 50 people only 2 people use it regularly. On the other hand, more than half of people use paypal's services.<br>Also is apple pay mobile only available on safari? What about Chrome, Firefox, etc.. PayPal's entrenchment doesn't make it invincible. Apple can chip away along with others but PayPal will likely continue strong. Apple has an edge with IPhone owners but it has to prove that it can get them to use/switch to Apple-Pay. Time will tell if they are successful.
