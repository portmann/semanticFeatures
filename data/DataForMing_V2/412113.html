Disney Gouges Americans But Shareholders Love It - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha When Disney opened in 1955 the cost of a ticket was $1.00. Food prices at the park are obscene. There is no questioning the facts. Disney (NYSE: DIS ) has been a terrific investment over the years. But they have accomplished that feat by gouging Americans. Case in point: In 1955 when Disneyland opened, a one day ticket was $1.00, and 9 cents of that was a federal tax. In 2016 the one day ticket cost is $102. I challenge you to find any other product or service that has witnessed a 102 fold increase in price over the past sixty years. If that is not bad enough, a typical three day excursion now costs a minimum of $3,500! The thesis for this article is: Will the astronomical prices Disney charges finally catch up with them? Will attendance at the theme parks continue the flat to negative trend Q2 2016 exhibited? And should it stop you from considering Disney stock as a buy at current prices? Given the drop on product sales and the diminishing returns of the media networks and parks/resorts divisions, Disney faces difficult times. But alas, the possibility of the difficult times is why Disney stock has sold off over 20% from the all time high. Everyone knows about Disney's theme parks. But that is only the tip of the iceberg of what Disney has become. Disney has evolved into a worldwide entertainment conglomerate as well as a vacation destination. Among the key Disney holdings: Disney's cable networks include ESPN (80% owned), the Disney Channels and ABC Family (all 100% owned). The Company also has a 33% interest in Hulu LLC (Hulu), and a 50% effective interest in Fusion Media Networks LLC (Fusion). The Company also operates the ABC Television Network (NYSE: ABC ), which as of October 3, 2015, had affiliation agreements with 242 local television stations reaching almost 100% of all U.S. television households. The Company distributes films primarily under the Walt Disney Pictures, Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm and Touchstone banners. The Company produces and distributes Indian movies through its UTV banner. The Company owns and operates the Walt Disney World Resort in Florida; the Disneyland Resort in California; Aulani, a Disney Resort & Spa in Hawaii; the Disney Vacation Club; the Disney Cruise Line; and Adventures by Disney. The Company also manages and has effective ownership interests of 81% in Disneyland Paris (see recapitalization discussion below), 47% in Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and 43% in Shanghai Disney Resort The Disney moat has a broad range. It is not a one trick pony. It is that diversification that has rewarded shareholders so well in the past. Since December 31, 2011 Disney stock has appreciated by 25% annually without dividend reinvestment. Clearly these returns have outpaced all general market indices. Since 2011 Disney has experienced revenue growth of 6.4%. At the same time, they have maintained a healthy balance sheet despite large capital outlays. Long term debt has increased only $1.45 billion since 2011 despite several acquisitions and new park openings. This past quarter (Q2 2016) however saw some disturbing trends. Product revenues for the quarter decreased 6%, or $111 million, to $1.8 billion primarily due to a decrease in home entertainment and console game volumes and an unfavorable FX Impact, partially offset by increased domestic parks and resorts guest spending on food, beverage and merchandise. In addition, park attendance was flat and hotel occupancy dropped 1%. Despite the attendance drop Disney still managed to make 8% more per customer, thanks to the profit maximization of their customers (aka gouging). All one needs to do is take a look (later in the article) at what a typical three day vacation costs. The prices Disney charges are similar to the price increases Kalo Bois ( OTCPK:KBIOQ ) implemented when ex CEO Martin Shkreli decided that it would be a good idea to raise the price of Benanidazole by 5000% overnight (from $13.50 to $750). But I digress. Below is a breakdown of both revenues and income by segment as extracted from Disney's most recent SEC filed Annual Report : Income as a percentage of revenues has increased dramatically. 2015 over 2014 saw a 134 basis point improvement, and 2015 over 2013 witnessed a 417 basis point improvement. Media Networks & Parks/Resorts accounted for 73.73% of income in 2015. That is down from 76.77% in 2014 and 84.28% in 2013. While diversification is good, to have your two largest business segments produce diminishing returns raises caution flags. Studio entertainment has been the performance leader. Unfortunately for Disney, this category is the most unstable with movie sales and profits being both the least consistent and predictable of any Disney business segment. To break down the data further, ESPN was a stellar performer this past quarter, but as pointed out in this Fortune Article , future assistance from ESPN is questionable. Nonetheless, the Disney minions insist that all will be OK in with Disney, and at the current price I have to agree with them. Yes I think Disney is taking advantage of us with the price increases they institute, but if Americans keep shelling out the money we are not giving Disney any reason to stop! As far as the theme parks go, if there was ever a doubt that they are still a draw (for now) all you need to do is read this article headline: One Million Chinese Flock to Shanghai Disneyland Before It Even Opens . With that as a backdrop, you have to give Disney credit for creativity. They are still trying to find new ways to extract even MORE money form us. As if $102 a ticket a day was not steep enough, Disney tried a new promotion where they offered $149 a night passes for three hours of after hours admission . As the article explains, the appeal was supposed to be the reduced wait lines for rides and attractions, free ice cream and soft drinks. It was such a failure that the price was reduced to $75 for Disney park holders and members of the Disney Vacation Club timeshare program before finally being scrapped. Before you do anything you need to get there. Now everyone's airfare is different but for the sake of this article I am using four round trip tickets at $250 each. Total price $1,000. According to Disney World's website a very cheap no frills standard room starts at $350 a night before taxes. Total cost including taxes $1,200. Everyone knows that you are going to pay hefty prices for meals. Unless you want to waste valuable time by traveling off park you need to pay a hefty price for your meals. Below is a sample of how much meals will cost. The assumption is that one day you pay for just lunch, one day is just dinner and one day is both. Case in point: D-Luxe Burgers just opened this year in Disney World. It is a basic no frills hamburger restaurant. but there is nothing basic about the prices. The cheapest burger costs $9.99. Want french fries? Add $4.99. Thirsty? A Michelob costs $7.00 and a lowfat milk is $1.99. So using those prices a lunch for four (two adults and two children) is an ungodly $78 before tax and tip, or $95 total. Just for hamburgers! Want to go to a fancy restaurant and see a few attractions? You will add another $100 to $300 to the above prices. Ok, you have been walking all afternoon and you want something a little nicer than a fast burger. You want to sit down and relax. So you go to an onsite Rainforest Cafe . The average entree with a side dish is between $18 and $25 each. Add on drinks and two desserts and a tip and your wallet has just lost $140. Remember, to keep costs down we decided to only have lunch on day one, dinner on day two and both lunch and dinner on day three. Three day Total $470 Now I am intentionally omitting the option of going to a play or any attractions or other form of secondary entertainment. If that is included, you will first need to take out a second mortgage on your home. The total cost for a BASIC three day vacation at Disney World is over $3,500 and can easily top $5,000. OUCH! That can buy Mickey Mouse a LOT of cheese! The prices Disney charges make the 28% default interest rates on credit cares look like a steal. So what does it all mean? I hate Disney. I hate how they have taken advantage of every American family's pocketbook to enrich their shareholders. To be totally honest, the one thing I really hate is how well Disney has performed. I do not want to see them succeed by charging usurious rates for the entertainment they provide. Still, despite my rant, I have to admit that given the 20% plus pullback in the stock Disney is a consistent market outperformer and it should continue to outperform the overall market indices.
