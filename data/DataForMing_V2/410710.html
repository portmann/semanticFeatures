Ford India Private Ltd will recall 48,000 EcoSport diesel vehicles, made between April 2013 and June 2014, to install a new bundle clip on the fuel and brake lines, it said in the statement. It plans to recall another 700 EcoSport vehicles made between January and February 2016 and fitted with a 60/40 rear folding seat. "On certain vehicles, the 40 percent rear seat backrest might have been assembled with bolts that do not meet Ford's material specification, potentially causing the bolts to break," the company said.
