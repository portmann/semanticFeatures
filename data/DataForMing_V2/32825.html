Schwab Touts Fundamental Indexes As Alternative To The S&P 500 | Seeking Alpha Traditional market capitalization-based indexes like the S&P 500 assume "the biggest companies are the best companies," according to Schwab's Anthony Davidow, and "some would even say that market-cap indexes overweight the overvalued stocks and underweight the undervalued stocks." In response to these inherent shortcomings of market cap-weighting, Mr. Davidow advocates fundamentally weighted indexes in the recently published whitepaper, Fundamentally Weighted Indexes: An Alternative to the S&P 500 ? Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is the largest company in the history of the world, and it has gained more than half of its current heft since Tim Cook took over as the company's CEO in 2011. Since the S&P 500 and other market cap-based indexes weigh their holdings according to market cap, they have continually added shares of Apple as it has grown in size. This has a bullish effect on the indexes so long as Apple maintains its bullish trajectory - but when Apple falls from grace, investors in passively managed, market cap-weighted indexes may be in for unexpected losses. By contrast, fundamentally weighted indexes weigh their components according to factors such as adjusted sales, retained operating cash flow, and dividends, not size. As of June 2014, Apple was the 18th largest component of the Russell Fundamental U.S. Large Company Index, accounting for around 1% of its holdings; while it was the largest component of the cap-weighted Russell 1000, accounting for nearly 3% of its holdings. Mr. Davidow outlines the differences between reconstitution and rebalancing of an index. Market cap-weighted indexes never actually "rebalance," the only reconstitute - they replace old components with new ones and, as part of the reconstitution, they assign all of the components new weights. Fundamental indexes, by contrast, reconstitute as well as rebalance, with rebalancing taking place more frequently. Rebalancing, as opposed to reconstitution, entails keeping the same components, but adjusting their weights within the index. Fundamental indexes rebalance frequently to avoid the problem of "letting winners ride" that's common with market cap-weighted indexes - i.e., the "Apple effect," wherein more and more shares of a single stock are accumulated as the stock goes higher, without regard to the stock's fundamentals. As of June 2014, the largest component in the Russell Fundamental U.S. Large Company Index was Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM ), which accounted for 4.83% of the index's total holdings. This was based on Exxon's superior adjusted sales, retained operating cash flow, and dividends. Other large holdings included Chevron (NYSE: CVX ), AT&T (NYSE: T ), and ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP ), which may be indicative of over-exposure to the energy sector. That sector has continued to underperform since June 2014, and so has AT&T, which shows that while fundamental indexes don't have the problem of inherently overemphasizing overvalued firms, they may add exposure to underperforming sectors too early. Nevertheless, Mr. Davidow says that the "bottom line" is that selecting and weighing securities according to fundamental factors, rather than size, leads to different [emphasis added] index construction and performance results. This difference results in low correlation with market cap-based holdings, which can potentially result in diversification benefits. Fundamentally linked indexes break the link with price. This results in portfolios that endemically linked with beta, thereby providing the opportunity for alpha generation. Fundamentally linked index investing may generate higher transaction fees, due to the higher level of turnover, than passively managed funds, but their fees are lower than actively managed funds, which rely on manager expertise rather than fundamental guidelines to make investment decisions.
