Verizon hints at video service details - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha Jun 24 2015, 18:21 ET | About: Verizon Communications (VZ) | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor With its AOL deal closed , Verizon ( VZ -1%) is providing some peeks at what an upcoming video service may look like. "We see the world shifting very quickly to mobile and we believe that mobile will represent 80 percent of consumers' media consumption in the coming years," said CFO Fran Shammo. "And the Verizon-AOL partnership will allow us to capture that shifting opportunity." Verizon may get around the data-bucket problem with ad-supported data -- which may be vital as it seeks uptake with consumers facing a variety of options for mobile and over-the-top video. The company believes its plan there fits with recent FCC net neutrality regulations. The service will work on competitors networks and Wi-Fi and will have some kind of premium tier, which might be pay-per-view. As for content, so far it has 200 hours promised from DreamWorks Animation's youth-focused AwesomenessTV, as well as rights to the Live Earth Concert and an NFL partnership providing live football for $5/month.
