Intel, Micron: My Thoughts On 3D X Point Memory - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha On July 29th Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) and Micron (NASDAQ: MU ) held a joint webcast to announce a new memory technology called 3D X point memory. Representing Intel was senior Vice President Rob Crooke with Micron represented by CEO Mark Durcan. The conference was arranged in only a day and, to me, it looked like Rob was having the time of his life while it appeared that Mark wished he wasn't there. Technical details were short on the new memory, but it is said to be 10 times (or more {Crooke}) denser than DRAM, but not as dense as (current) NAND, 1000 times faster than NAND, but not as fast as (current) DRAM, with 1000 times the endurance of NAND, but not (YET) infinite endurance. The new memory is also scalable. Don't forget that, it is very important. The first part out of the chute is 128Gb. Two shrinks and 3D X point begins to crowd even 3D NAND. More interesting to me was that the new memory, whether it is made out of star dust or peanut butter, is Random Access (Byte addressable like DRAM), and Non-Volatile like NAND. So, where does this new technology get positioned? The simple answer is that it would be sandwiched between DRAM and NAND in the memory hierarchy. The idea here is that the 3D X point would displace some (MOST) of the DRAM, yet put more Random Access Memory in the system before moving to NAND storage. OK, so far we get some incremental performance, with some dollar saving that, ummm, comes out of the DRAM budget. Beginning to see why I think Mr. Durcan didn't want to be at this meeting? It is noteworthy that when Rob referred to the density of this memory, he compared it to "conventional memory", of course conventional memory is DRAM. Rob, you old wordsmith, you. I was struck by the emphasis in the presentation on close proximity of computing and memory. Anyone who has read my articles for any length of time will know that memory/compute proximity is one of my hot buttons as well. It would be useful to discuss Intel's EMIB (Embedded Multi-Die Interconnect Bridge) with this new memory. EMIB is a packaging technology that provides most of the benefits of 3D IC technology without the complexity and cost problems associated with TSV (Through Silicon Vias) technology. Soooo, since the new memory has high, but finite endurance, it probably couldn't be used for the very first tier of system memory. For that, one might use a monolithic 8Gb DRAM or even the 1Gb (128MB) level 4 DRAM cache chip that Intel currently uses in their high end CPU chips. Right behind that, a single 16GB 3D X point chip would be appropriate. So, we have the CPU (about 100 sq. mm average in 14nm (…no, the real 14nm that Intel makes) and about 80sq. mm for the 1GB of DRAM and about 170 sq. mm for the 16GB of 3D X point. For processor and system memory we have a total of about 350 sq. mm of silicon. That is well within the size range to be included in a single CPU package using EMIB technology. Let's think about cost and end price of this module. Intel will get an average selling price across all client SKUs of about $100.+ The 1GB of DRAM might cost $4 and sell, as a separate component, for about $6. The 16Gb XPoint chip will cost about $5 and sell as an individual chip for about $15. In order to develop a price for the EMIB module containing processor and 17GB of system memory you might compare it to 16GB of DRAM. That would be about $100. So, you can take it to the bank that Intel will charge $100 more for the processor with very high performance, very low power 17GB of system memory in the package. It will come down to if you want a client PC you will have to take the system memory with it in a single package at a single price … that will actually look fair given the power saving and compute performance and compared to any alternative way of providing those functions. The same approach in a mobile compute module, that provides hours more battery time, should be the "compelling product" that Otellini used to talk about. I haven't figured out how Intel sells the mobile version for the $60 price that would be required for mass adoption in the highest tier smart phones. Maybe the mobile part backs down to 128MB DRAM and 3-4GB of X point and NAND is still used for mass storage … at $100 per increment like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) charges. One way or the other Intel will creative-destruct memory into the processor package where it ceases to be a price sensitive commodity and becomes part of an Intel proprietary product. The last time I wrote something like memory in package it wasn't possible sizewise … and I was reminded of that often. Not only is it now possible but it is scalable to boot. Everything points to Intel being the big winner here and I have chosen to play Intel over Micron. The adjacent businesses are client and data center businesses and mobile could become a large profitable business. This won't hurt the Intel SSD business either. I think that Micron actually loses on this deal since they don't have an adjacent business to tie the X point memory to. X point will eat into DRAM with every design win. There is X point version 2 and new memory B, version one in the pipeline, but Micron can't stand much more of this kind of innovation.
