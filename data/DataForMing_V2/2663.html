Submitted by Mike Krieger via Liberty Blitzkrieg blog , I don’t know what it’s going to take to get people to stop using Facebook. I really don’t. Last month, I highlighted an extremely important warning from Salim Varani in the post,  A Very Disturbing and Powerful Post – “Get Your Loved Ones Off Facebook.”  If you somehow missed that piece, go ahead and read it now. Here’s a an excerpt to give you a little taste: “Oh yeah, I’ve been meaning to ask you why you’re getting off Facebook,” is the guilty and reluctant question I’m hearing a lot these days. Like we kinda know Facebook is bad, but don’t really want to know. I’ve been a big Facebook supporter – one of the first users in my social group who championed what a great way it was to stay in touch, way back in 2006. I got my mum and brothers on it, and around 20 other people. I’ve even taught Facebook marketing in one of the UK’s biggest tech education projects, Digital Business Academy. I’m a techie and a marketer — so I can see the implications — and until now, they hadn’t worried me. I’ve been pretty dismissive towards people who hesitate with privacy concerns. With this latest privacy change on January 30th, I’m scared. Given the company’s aggressive push to monetize all their users’ personal data and conversations, it was only a matter of time before we’d see an egregious real world example of what can go wrong. It all went wrong for Daniel Kapp, an Austria-based strategic consultant diagnosed with prostrate cancer last month. Shortly after googling the disease, he became bombarded with funeral home advertisements on Facebook. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t get rid of them. A cancer patient who searched online for support about his disease was left horrified when Facebook began placing advertisement for funeral directors on his Facebook feed. Daniel Kapp, 46, was diagnosed with prostate cancer last month. Shortly after he used the web to learn more about the illness. When he opened Facebook the following day he said he was ‘bombarded’ with ‘insensitive’ promotions that he couldn’t remove. ‘I was just knocked off my feet to see that there on the screen,’ said Mr Kapp, who works as a strategic consultant in Austria . He blamed Facebook for monitoring the data about the searches he had done and then using it in order to sell it on to potential advertisers. When contacted by local media, the directors of the funeral companies said they were shocked their adverts were being used to target people in this way. One said: ‘I can confirm that this should never have happened.’ It gathers information about devices, sites people visit, searches they’ve made and demographic data they have entered into their account on the social network. Initially these cookies were just used on the site, but in September Facebook launched its Atlas ad platform that monitors these movements around the wider web. Today Facebook added a new tool called Topic Data that now additionally scans what people are ‘saying about events, brands, subjects and activities.’ More abuses to come. Virtually guaranteed. Facebook has not yet responded to MailOnline’s request to comment on Mr Kapp’s complaints. I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again. One of the most significant indications things are turning around for the better and that humanity is growing up, is when Facebook begins to bleed users. Until then… Fri, 03/13/2015 - 11:56 | 5885399 replaceme Fri, 03/13/2015 - 11:59 | 5885407 Lost My Shorts You will know the technology is perfected when they start peppering you with ads for funeral homes, and you aren't sure why. What part of the body is the prostrate? C'mon.  If the core of the article is a guy with cancer getting an inappropriate ad, at least get the name of his cancer right.

For anyone who has yet to face the barrage of bank breaking choices upon the death of a loved one - or your own death: http://www.trappistcaskets.com/products/urns/single-wooden-urns/ Fri, 03/13/2015 - 12:34 | 5885546 raywolf Fri, 03/13/2015 - 12:40 | 5885564 KnuckleDragger-X Fri, 03/13/2015 - 13:07 | 5885671 petolo I'm signed uo for the wolf, coyote, grizzly bear and turkey vulture plan. Didn't take the Polar bear option: too cold and far away. I agree with you but the family members who survive you will be under terrible pressure to make decisions while in shock and mourning and that's where Death Inc. steps in to insist that lots and lots of money must be spent on a dead body. You think Goldman Sachs is filthy? Try any local funeral parlour for pure greed and coersion. Death Inc. is a filthy racket, one of the worst, why do you think they are in league with Facebook? Fri, 03/13/2015 - 13:40 | 5885847 ceilidh_trail I went through this last year upon the death of my father. A lot of the pressure is self induced- we can't skimp on him now, we only get to do this once, so gotta do it right, blah blah blah. I work in an ICU and see death routinely. It sort of blunts me to wanting to be extravegant on funerals. But, my siblings all also get a say. Luckily, I convinced them to only be moderately ridiculous. We still spent somewhere near 20K. That is money that could have stayed in the family and helped some of the poorer ones. Lots of emotion/family politics all swirling about with this stuff. And the funeral home guys know it as typical and take advantage of it. Fri, 03/13/2015 - 13:33 | 5885808 Raging Debate going it will be time to go. I'll buy a very fast used motorcycle, pick up aome peyote and jump the Grand Canyon without a parachute. Of course I'lll Youtube it and leave the ad royalties to the kids. My fiance is mortified but my kids love the plan. One last mighty thrill then the great beyond. Fri, 03/13/2015 - 12:26 | 5885516 101 years and c... facebook blows.  and anyone that uses it must face the consequences.  sorry, not going to feel bad for this guy getting funeral home ads because he has agreed to let facebook into all facets of his life. Fri, 03/13/2015 - 12:00 | 5885410 El Vaquero I haven't logged into my facefuck account for probably 2 years.  I was tempted to make a troll account under the name of "Chairman Mao" to troll the ATF over its proposed M855 ban here recently, but I resisted the temptation to troll the BATFE. Fri, 03/13/2015 - 12:08 | 5885446 Blythes Master Do not do that.  I deleted my NSACIAFUCKERBOOK account because under Zuckerfucker's new TOS, simply signing into your Fuckerbook account aloows fuckerbook complete access to every file on that device. You have been warned. Fri, 03/13/2015 - 12:14 | 5885473 El Vaquero What's the over/under that the NSA already has all of your searches stored with enough information to link those searches to you? Fri, 03/13/2015 - 12:20 | 5885492 maskone909 i will bet that there is a clause in the TOS that gives FB the ability to continue back-dooring your device even after the account is closed. Fri, 03/13/2015 - 12:50 | 5885592 Philo Beddoe I have no FB account. However, I just assume anything I search or post is public. I really do not give a shit at this point.  Fri, 03/13/2015 - 13:17 | 5885722 Bastiat .  "under Zuckerfucker's new TOS, simply signing into your Fuckerbook  account aloows fuckerbook complete access to every file on that device."

Fri, 03/13/2015 - 12:10 | 5885454 Blythes Master When exactly did "selfie" mean anything else? Self-portrait is a painting/photograph of oneself. "Selfie" is simply an annoying term for the same, but then anything from Australia is fucking annoying... Fri, 03/13/2015 - 12:16 | 5885484 Skateboarder I think that element of human curiosity has always been there. There was never an avenue for such disgusting display of it until recently. Small story, bears repeating. Chinese New Year this year - guy across street lights up phat fireworks. Two gals (millennial age) bust out their phones and video the damn thing. People can't even enjoy watching live-in-front-of-you fireworks these days... Fri, 03/13/2015 - 12:43 | 5885574 maskone909 its a paradigm shift towards socialism.  your individual experience means NOTHING unless it is validated by a slew of likes and emoji's. Fri, 03/13/2015 - 13:06 | 5885668 maskone909 explain the rational behinde self advertisement.  and fit that into why 10 yearolds are taking selfies.  now tell me how any of that shit matters when the whole purpose of it is to monitor your communication.  the like buttons are just an incentive for dumbasses to continue putting their lives online, for more validation.  btw i didnt dv u Fri, 03/13/2015 - 13:22 | 5885748 Bastiat The deep urge is to relationship - at it's extreme, melting into some group or collective.  Socialism is a political/economic expression of the same urge.  People are intrinsically social but also have the capacity to operate as more-or-less independent agents -- but only if that capacity is developed, most fundamentally as the ability to face the naked existential fact of their own life and death.  Fri, 03/13/2015 - 13:46 | 5885888 maskone909 socialism is much more sinister than simply attributing it to natural human behavior, or for survival.  its a product of corruption and croneyism- of powerful groups of men. to say its a natural tendincy would be to say corruption is too.  its a different matter all together when applied to individuals, vs groups, vs governments.  Fri, 03/13/2015 - 12:01 | 5885421 i_call_you_my_base Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! 03-13 13:27: The FDA give ARIAD Pharmaceuticals' (ARIA) Iclusig drug orphan... 03-13 12:57: Shipping source reports completion of repairs at Iraq-Turkey pipeline... 03-13 12:57: According to sources, Mexican officials have authorized further... 03-13 12:57: Lumber Liquidators (LL) CEO Tom Sullivan continues defiant stance on... 03-13 13:48: Lennar March volatility elevated into Q1 and outlook 03-13 13:48: Periscope says joined Twitter in January 03-13 13:45: UPDATE: Spike in Valeant May be Attributed to Value Walk Report: 'Why Valeant Could Match And Beat Endo's Offer To Buy Salix' 03-13 13:45: Study Shows Brands Now Use Instagram More Than Facebook 03-13 13:12: CORRECTION: Lumber Liquidators Founder, Chairman Tom Sullivan On CNBC Says 60 Minutes Test Is Not A Real World Test 03-13 13:12: Lumber Liquidators Founder, Chairman Tom Sullivan On CNBC Says Company Has Checked Its Chinese-Made Laminates 03-13 13:12: Russia ETF Falls As Kremlin Reportedly Prepares For 'Mysterious' Announcement Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! 03-12 23:12: Is It Time To Prepare For War? 03-13 10:10: Kremlin Rejects Rumor Of Putin Illness, Shows Footage Of Today's Meeting 03-13 11:44: Europe Has A Modest Proposal For Greece: "Don't Pay Wages For One Or Two Months" 03-13 13:23: SocGen Tries To Predict When The Next US Bear Market Starts 03-13 6:49: Parasite Turns On Parasite: HFT Sues Other HFTs For "Egregious Manipulation" Of Treasury Securities 03-13 6:33: The West's Plan To Drop Russia From SWIFT Hilariously Backfires 03-13 0:21: The New London Gold Fix And China's Gold Strategy 03-13 9:50: Flash Boys' Michael Lewis Warns "The Problem's Not Just HFT, The Problem Is The Entire System" Make sure to read our " How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black Helicopters] " Guide It would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .
