Facebook's Future Is Video - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha Facebook is pushing hard on the video front, and from several different angles. The company thinks video is going to be its core revenue earner over the coming decade. Here's why. Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) is aggressively pursuing its video segment as it continues its search for more revenue streams. And why not? Mobile usage has been on the rise, and along with it, video consumption is going up and up. Aside from the aspects of the number of users watching video content and the amount of time spent, video is where the dollars are. In this article, I will try to cover the reasoning behind the aggressive video push from Facebook. "According to Cisco, mobile video traffic will increase at a CAGR of 62% between now and 2020, around 9% higher than average mobile traffic. Cisco predicts that total mobile traffic will reach an annual rate of 30.6 Exabytes per month." If you have been following Facebook, you may have noticed that in the last two months, there has been a never-ending stream of announcements with respect to videos. This month, the company launched a dedicated hub for watching live and recorded videos, and a search engine to help you find videos. Facebook Live was also launched recently, a key feature of which is instant video sharing. It's all well and good that mobile usage and video content is proliferating like virus. But what does Facebook stand to gain at the end of the day? There are a couple of reasons. The first is to keep their growing user base engaged - and by growing, I don't mean just their Facebook users. Now that WhatsApp, Instagram and Masquerade are in the fray, Facebook's user base is greater than the sum of users across all these platforms. In an earlier article, I explained why even a heavy overlap of users across these applications will not affect their ability to grow their advertising revenue. And this brings us to the second reason - the monetary motive. The monetisation aspects of videos are too irresistible to pass up, so it's only logical that Facebook wants to position itself as the dominant player in the video space by leveraging what it already possesses - human capital and user engagement. You may have a question at this point - why videos, when they're doing just fine with other types of advertising? Notwithstanding the growth of video content and sharing, video advertising itself is much more profitable for an advertising platform. But more to the point, it is also better for the average advertiser because people will tend to click on a video ad more often than any other type of advertising. As you can see, video ads are three times more click-friendly than any other ad type. So, for a given video ad, three times as many people are likely to click on it. If an advertiser pays per thousand impressions, they basically get more clicks per dollar of ad spend. So, of course, more and more ad content is going to move into video format over time. It's based on the sound assumption that if a particular model is effective, the majority will always flock around that model. That's why video advertising will grow, and that's why Facebook needs and wants to be in that space in a big way. I believe Facebook is confident that video ads are the only viable solution to their current problem of low CPM rates (cost an advertiser pays for 1,000 impressions served) they have to offer to get advertisers on their networks. Unlike Google's ( GOOG , GOOGL ) primary approach of targeting keywords, ads on Facebook attempt to target their audience demographically, and based on usage patterns. Of course, Google has that as well, but their keyword planner is a major part of any advertiser's arsenal within their AdWords network. No article on video advertising would be complete without a look at YouTube - the platform that made it all happen. YouTube was the pioneer of user-generated video content that was shareable with the world, and they've learned a lot since they first made their appearance. YouTube's viewability on mobiles and tablets is as high as 94% against a combined competitors' average of only 54%. That means there's a very good chance that a user clicking on a video in YouTube is also going to see the in-stream ads associated with that video. If you've ever used YouTube, you'll know that you can skip most ads after about 4 seconds. Not all of them, though; after skipping a certain number of ads, the next one will have to run its course of 30 seconds before your video resumes. And it's this feature that makes video ads much more non-intrusive than ugly pop-ups, frustrating pop-unders and truly offensive in-the-face flash banners. In a sense, it's like TV advertising without the ability to switch channels when commercials come on. That's the new trend in video advertising, and as Google and YouTube have proven, is about as non-intrusive as it will get. As for Facebook, they're still experimenting with various monetization options for video advertising. They recently started testing their video feed , which offers a variety of options such as picture-in-picture the way Tumblr has implemented just last year, and the ability to save videos to watch later. They're also experimenting with inserting advertiser videos within the video feeds, and claim to be "pleased with the initial results" of these multiple tests. These recent tests are additions to a slew of tests that include 360-degree video support for the Oculus Rift, a web-embeddable video player similar to YouTube's, as well as tools for live video broadcasting. All of these are aligned to make Facebook the next big competitor to YouTube - and go beyond the experience and flexibility that the latter currently provides. Indications are strong that Facebook's core monetization will be around videos in the next few years. The parent platform has already reached maturity, additional platforms are being continually added to complement Facebook's own capabilities, and international markets dictate that nearly nine times the user base is required to generate revenues similar to North America. That's the reason Facebook has been adding to its user base via Instagram (400 million) and WhatsApp (1 billion). Video is the future of Facebook, and video monetization is the future of their market. They have the ability to threaten YouTube's position, and Zuckerberg is not going to let this opportunity slip by. The challenges are certainly there - YouTube has the advantage right now of a much larger base of creators of pro content. Facebook has to build that over time, nurturing content creators, giving them the ability to earn more than YouTube can provide, and gradually building that community. But community is their forte, as we all know. Their advantages are their user bases, and the fact that Alphabet's Google doesn't have the head start of a dedicated social media application - something that's starting to hurt them. It is also what will continue to allow Facebook and other social players to chip away at their user base - and make a lot of money in the process. Thanks for reading!
