ETF Hub Nov 13 2015, 18:49 ET | About: Verizon Communications (VZ) | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor Along with a price hike for its unlimited wireless phone plans on Sunday, Verizon ( VZ -1.3%) is bringing back activation fees, instituting a $20 charge for new lines of service. The carrier had waived the fees just a few months ago when it abandoned phone subsidies and service contracts; they were $40 at the time for customers who signed two-year deals. AT&T ( T -1.1%) charges a $15 fee for devices sold through its installment program, or $45 for a two-year contract or purchased device. Verizon is raising the price of its unlimited data plan by $20/month on Sunday, a move in line with recent ones by its competitors. Sprint ( S +0.7%) raised its own unlimited data plan by $10/month at the end of September. At least Verizon waited until after T-Mobile's ( TMUS +2%) "Un-carrier X" event to drop the news; T-Mo's John Legere is fond of lambasting competitors for broad line activation charges, though every carrier has one somewhere.
