ETF Hub VZ CFO Fran Shammo has given investors many good comments over the last year as an indication of Verizon's future. The question now is whether VZ's future strategy will pay off for shareholders. As an investor who owned shares of Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) for nearly a decade , and has since followed the company very closely, CFO Fran Shammo has been a gift of sorts. Not only is he active in corporate presentations and speaking engagements, he's not afraid to share what he sees as coming trends. Such transparency is good for investors, so in looking back at the last year, here are some big statements from Shammo that might shape the future for Verizon's stock. 2015 is a very important year for Verizon primarily because 2014 created change, much of which was unexpected to affect Verizon. Therefore, 2015 will be the reaction to that change. Shammo famously said early last year that Verizon would not buy customers, implying the company would not enter the wireless service pricing wars. Yet, by the end of 2014 the company had already begun offering new subscriber incentives and providing data packages that were comparable to AT&T (NYSE: T ). Therefore, Verizon was forced into the price war, meaning the company must now get more creative in ways to find growth in a mature market. The effect of entering the price war has been pressured margins. Investors worry that margin pressure will continue due to the wireless industry being one of high costs and competition. However, Shammo recently said , "Over time we believe we will continue to increase margins," in regards to finding ways to cut costs. Verizon continues to merge and consolidate its operating functions as more of its network becomes software-defined, which is expected to cut costs. Another way to cut costs is to make its network more efficient, and to retire costly legacy networks like voice. Back in August of last year Shammo announced that Verizon would launch a nationwide voice-over-LTE ((VoLTE)) service by years end. He didn't disappoint; Verizon, along with T-Mobile, became the first wireless service providers to launch VoLTE last year. As explained in a previous article , VoLTE is a future $16 billion opportunity that will eventually allow service providers to retire legacy voice networks while upgrading voice experiences on a mobile phone. Given the sheer size of Verizon's 4G network, and the large investments it has made, investors have since speculated that more 4G-related services are sure to follow. That said, just because Verizon has the largest and most complete 4G network doesn't mean the company will rest on its laurels. In December Shammo said : The day that we start to cut wireless capex, that's the day that we should start to wonder where the future of the business is going. I don't believe that wireless capex will decline. That same day, Verizon guided for its CAPEX budget in 2015 to be $17 billion, the high end of prior guidance. Shammo said that investments in wireless is a good thing, meaning "usage is going up and revenue will continue to accrete." Verizon plans to drive that usage higher by creating products that both consume more data, and keep customers on Verizon's network longer. One such example is its "mobile first" LTE Multicast. Shammo recently said that Verizon has been trialing the product for quite sometime, and once complete will become an efficient way to deliver live video to millions of viewers at the same time, such as the Super Bowl. This is one such way that Verizon plans to keep you on their network. Granted, the flipside to focusing so much on wireless is that Verizon's wireline business often gets forgotten. While wireline includes declining businesses like home phone services it also includes growing services like FiOS broadband internet and TV. If Shammo's guidance for wireline CAPEX to decline is any indication of the future, then Verizon clearly sees more upside in its wireless business for the future. As a result, Verizon has begun to sell legacy wireline assets in order to pay for investments and acquisitions in its wireless space. As explained in a previous article , Verizon's decision to spend $130 billion for full control of Verizon Wireless makes it difficult for the company to be aggressive in debt markets from this point forward, and because it heavily diluted the stock during the acquisition it can't use public offerings to find cash. That means Verizon must sell assets. However, Shammo insists that divested assets are not essential to Verizon's outlook. In regards to Verizon's asset sale to Frontier (NASDAQ: FTR ), Shammo said: The divestiture of the three properties, which consist of Florida, California and Texas, were looked at as islands amongst themselves and don't fit anywhere else in the footprint and are not contiguous with any other wireline properties we have. Verizon added over 260,000 FiOS subscribers during the fourth quarter alone, making it one of the company's greatest growth drivers. Therefore, despite the wireless focus, I for one was quite discouraged to see the assets go. Yet, Shammo insists that Verizon has "a great set of properties on the FiOS footprint that are contiguous up and down the Northeast corridor." That said, Shammo also hints that there may be more assets like those sold to Frontier, and that further asset sales could occur. He says, "for the right price and right terms, if there's an asset we don't believe is strategic to Verizon and can return shareholder value, we'll dispose of that asset." So, what should you expect of Verizon in the immediate future, and long-term? According to Shammo, "You should expect wireless capex to trend up and wireline capex to trend down." This is a company in transition, and if Shammo's right, then there is a lot to like. Certainly, the company has too much debt, and the fact that it must sell assets to find cash is very bothersome. However, if in fact Verizon is not selling essential assets to FiOS and foresees a clear path to cut costs and boost data consumption via new products and services, then yes, the stock is undervalued and a good opportunity. Although, I would recommend to watch the company closely, as Shammo was wrong before about the price war, and if Verizon does get forced into selling essential assets in its fastest growing FiOS business, all bets are off.
