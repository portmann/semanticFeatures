What Investors Are Missing About Disney's Earnings - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha ESPN appeared to be down 13%, but this was due to unfavorable comps. Media Networks also showed off its strong pricing power, growing income by 9%. Disney is making the right decision by shuttering their in-house game studio, given their lack of success with it so far. Disney's proven ability to continue to generate high quality films that establish strong brands will continue to boost their other segments, such as Consumer Products and Parks & Resorts. Fears over cable TV subscribers run high as always, and the latest earnings release from Disney (NYSE: DIS ) proved no exception. Disney missed on the top and bottom line, with a particularly large miss on revenue. The reason for this miss is largely due to the media networks and consumer products segments performing poorly. ESPN revenue was actually down 13% year over year, seemingly confirming investor's worst fears. The stock sold off 6% after hours. However, this is not a true like to like comparison. In the earnings call , management describes how eight big games took place in Q1 this year, while they took place in Q2 last year. This resulted in lost ad revenue. They further stated that a true like to like comparison would have likely showed a 3% increase in ESPN revenue, and revenue is currently 5% up from last year in the current quarter. Even beyond that, Media Networks as a whole had no revenue growth, but grew its operating income by 9%, showing off how much pricing power Disney commands. The decline for Consumer Products was mostly due to forex troubles, and Disney's in-house games (Infinity). This is why I believe that the shuttering of Infinity is the best decision, even if the costs associated with closing it are a bit expensive, at $147 million dollars. Creating digital games simply is not within Disney's core competency and never has been. They shuttered some of the associated game studios they bought, such as LucasArts, and had layoffs of 700 people for this division back in 2014. Revenue and operating income decreased, even as film revenue soared (which the games created were based on). Disney should continue to take advantage of their intellectual property though, through aggressive licensing to companies like EA (NASDAQ: EA ). Now let's talk about what went well for Disney. Studio revenue was obviously extraordinary, growing at 22%, but this was telegraphed well in advance. Still, the consistency with which Disney has managed to grow studio revenue over the years is impressive. Moreover, the brands they build with their films are very quickly taken advantage of, and have a much longer positive effect. For example, they intend to start pushing Zootopia in their park in China, due to the greater than expected success of it in China. They've managed to find a way to release Star Wars films every year now as well, which should be another incremental positive. Parks & Resorts wasn't a particularly exciting this quarter, but more progress was made on the park in Shanghai, and it should open up during this quarter. Ultimately, Disney is selling off on the headline lackluster growth/miss, but digging into the details reveals that the problem segments really weren't that bad at all this quarter. If anything, media networks did surprisingly well, given that it grew operating income even as ESPN had to deal with unfavorable comps. The Consumer Products category is likely to fare better in the long run, given that Disney is continuing to pump out a high volume of high quality films - which will lead to higher licensing fees.
