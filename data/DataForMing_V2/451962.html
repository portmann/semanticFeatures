Apple's Buyback Is Not The Problem - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha On Tuesday, I read an article from fellow site contributor Antonio Carradinha detailing that Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) share buybacks were a problem, not a solution . A majority of the analysis was based on short-term results, which due to recent performance skew the company's buyback performance. I don't believe that Apple's buyback is or has been a problem. I have a few issues with some of the key points the author made. The author takes a short-term look at Apple's share price, which has not done well in the past year or so. However, the buyback has been around for a couple of years, and the stock has done extremely well since the program started. Also, while earnings per share are declining now, that's a function of falling revenues and net income. To illustrate this point, let's take a look at Apple's fiscal second quarter results (calendar first quarter) over the last four years. (*Data adjusted for stock split. Results from Apple page here ) Net income has risen by 10.15% over the '13-'16 Q2 period, but earnings per share are up by 31.65%. The buyback has reduced the share count significantly, and normalized earnings per share are benefiting as a result. With the share count down by more than 16% over this period, you have to figure the current dividend payout has been bumped higher a bit as well. Even if we look at results compared to last year's quarter(s), the buyback is helping soften some of the earnings per share declines. Over the longer term, as shown above, the buyback has done what it was intended to do. The other issue I have is that when looking at the buyback, you have to look at possible alternatives. Let's use $30 billion for our argument. If you assume about 6 billion in outstanding shares, that's $5 in dividend payments. Would that money have been better in shareholders' hands? It's hard to say. We do know that earnings per share would have been hurt even more in this case though. What about making a large acquisition instead? Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) paid over $26 billion to acquire LinkedIn (NYSE: LNKD ). Had Apple been interested, maybe it would have cost $30 billion for that deal. Despite nearly $3 billion in revenues last year, LinkedIn lost $166 million on a GAAP basis. So while Apple would have had an extra percentage point or two of revenue growth, GAAP net income would probably be lower and you'd have a higher share count. Spending that money on something even more crazy like Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) would make the EPS situation even worse. Finally, let's also consider current market conditions, something I based my previous Apple article on. As of Tuesday's close, Apple's dividend yield was 2.40%, while the 30-Year US Treasury bond was yielding just 2.14%. With rates so low, it makes sense to repurchase shares and eliminate dividend payments, especially when your cost of debt ends up being lower than the dividend yield. There's a cash flow savings there, which can go back into the business for any number of uses. The chart below shows a comparison of Apple's yield vs. the 30-Year since the latest dividend raise. This doesn't even take into consideration another raise next year which would make Apple shares yield even more over the next 12 months. In the end, I don't see Apple's buyback as a problem for the company. I'm sure that flaws can be found with most share repurchase programs if you look at them over a short time period. A longer term analysis shows that Apple's buyback program has done what it intended to, and shares have done quite well since Apple started the program. At the moment, it also makes more financial sense to buyback shares with rates so low, especially compared to making extremely costly acquisitions. A key Apple analyst also detailed Wednesday morning low iPhone expectations reducing risk for the stock, adding to the notion that a buyback should work at the current time.
