Bloomberg: India turns down Apple request to import/sell used iPhones - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha May  3 2016, 11:29 ET | About: Apple Inc. (AAPL) | By: Eric Jhonsa, SA Eye on Tech , SA News Editor A telecom ministry official talking with Bloomberg says the Indian government has rejected an Apple ( AAPL +0.7%) request to import and sell refurbished iPhones. The country's environment ministry rejected a similar proposal in 2015. Selling refurbished iPhones - made available to Apple through its iPhone upgrade, trade-in, and recycling programs - has been a key part of Apple's efforts to grow sales in cost-sensitive India, where the company's phone share is estimated to be around 2% and cheap Android phones claim much of the smartphone market. Bloomberg notes Apple rivals launched a public campaign against its effort to sell used iPhones, arguing "such a move would trigger a flood of used electronics while defeating the government’s Make-in-India program to encourage local manufacturing." IDC believes local OEMs Micromax, Intex, and Lava are among the Indian smartphone market's top five players, along with Lenovo and market leader Samsung, which gets the majority of its Indian sales from its low-cost J-series Android phones. Current government is least corrupt in years and they will likely say no even Apple paid a huge bribe as Make in India is pet project of Current Prime Minister. This is a financial site. Go take your prejudices elsewhere. And yeah, they're prejudices because anyone can challenge you on your claim and there's absolutely no proof you can provide against the current Indian government. Just open one factory in India to manufacture iPhones for local market. It may be something close to simple repackaging of phones mostly manufactured elsewhere? You can do it Tim! It is a huge trash can no matter how you slice and dice it. As long as corruption is there there is more trash than you can imagine. Corruption and Deceit are at the core of the Indian society and that is what is being taught the moment you are born. Modi alone cannot do anything unless the youth of India take action and they are too busy being goons because then that takes them into Politics. How many people are being shown protecting Women in India when they are teased the moment they step out of the house let alone when they are raped? The smallest government job needs a huge bribe. I know this for a fact. Even Bank officials are corrupt and want to get a bribe to give you your money that you deposited in the bank. Entirely expected news from them, and good on them for keeping their priorities straight. There's absolutely no economic rationale for them to agree to something like this. It acts as an economic net drain to enable free imports of used CE devices. Apple should be working with Foxconn to accelerate the latter's manufacturing plant in India so they can build their products there, rather than making a futile bid to convince them to let Apple dump used obsolete gear there. No worries I don't buy anything that says Made In India either forget Make In India. The local telecom industry pumped major bribe money because there are several of them who have set up Manufacturing units similar to FoxConn and they control the Government even though the Prime Minister thinks his officers and Ministers do not take bribes. They think they have a chance to make Apple Phones in India and perhaps at some point also steal some of the technology. Pity your lack of knowledge about India. The telecom minister who took bribe is cooling his heals in Tihar jail for a little over 2 years. The Con-gress party that he was part of lost almost every seat in last general election. The current prime minister and his team are nationalists with clear vision of making India the best. You lost chance of bribing thru 2+ years ago :). At the rate scams of previous govt are getting exposed and proven in the court, you will have to wait another 8 years. Is there is anything to steal from iPhone? You mean curves? India has right to make decisions in its best interest. In this case it's a proper decision otherwise everyone will start importing used items, worse for trashing purposes. To add, Apple can try making in India that the government is pushing aggressively. Guess what, Foxconn is here already... for Xiaomi. BTW In this case I agreed with the Indians. That place is not a garbage dump. Apple Trade-In program mostly has a domestic/regional restriction, I.e can't trade in a Canadian used one in American stores, you can sell it in eBay of course. So while keeping price low, I'd expect my trade-in phone will be dumped to that market for more than what I get from Apple. It seems everyone is protectionist except the USA.  Time to get trump in to make sure others open their markets.
