Ford: Don't Rule Out A Turnaround In China - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford’s sales in China have dropped of late as the country’s economy is slowing down and the stock market is under stress. Since China accounts for 18% of Ford’s sales, weakness in the region has created a negative impact on the company’s stock price. Ford, however, can make a comeback in China as it is focusing on key growth hotspots such as SUVs, budget cars, and luxury cars. In a smart move, Ford has added three SUVs to its China lineup as the segment grew 34% in July, indicating that it is targeting a key growth market aggressively. China’s luxury car sales are expected to grow at 12% a year till 2020, which is why Ford is expanding its Lincoln dealerships in the country. There is no doubt that China is an important market for Ford (NYSE: F ), which is one of the key reasons why the company's stock price has taken a beating in the past three months. A slowing Chinese economy, coupled with weakness in the country's stock market, has created pressure on Ford's stock price performance as the company gets 18% of its sales from the country. In fact, a slowing Chinese economy has pushed Ford shares down by 20% in the past one year as concerns regarding the company's profitability in the country have surfaced since dealers are forced to give steep discounts to move inventory. However, I think that the weakness in the company's stock price performance in the past year is an opportunity in disguise as Ford is making smart moves to overcome the problems in China. Let's see how. Ford's management has shown the ability to weather the storm in China. Ford sells its products under joint ventures with two local Chinese automakers. With Changan Automobile Company, Ford makes passenger cars and SUVs, while with Jiangling Motor Corporation, or JMC, it builds commercial vehicles - mostly vans from Ford's Transit lineup. The commercial vehicle division, i.e. JMC, has suffered more loss of sales among the two joint ventures in China in recent months. Ford hasn't declared its August sales for China yet. But, at the end of July, sales at both JMC and Changan were near about flat as compared to the same period last year. Additionally, June and July were the months in which Ford posted negative growth. In fact, in July, Changan Ford saw a sales decline of 4%, which was better than the industry sales decline of 7.1 %. But, JMC put up a poor show by selling 12% less commercial vehicles as compared to last July. Now, the decline in sales is not surprising, as Ford said in its Q2 earnings call that it foresees a slowing Chinese economy by analyzing the slowing commercial-vehicle market in the country for several months. As a result, in response to the imminent slowdown, Ford China has made some smart adjustments in spending and production in order to cut costs and optimize margins in a scenario where vehicle pricing is under pressure. Moreover, Ford seems to have identified the bright spots in the Chinese market, which is why CEO Mark Fields recently made a statement stating that he is still bullish on China . While the auto industry in China is seeing a downturn, the SUV segment is still going strong. For instance, SUV sales rose 34% in July year-over-year. To capitalize on this trend, Ford has added three new SUVs to its product lineup in the country. The new SUV models include a five-passenger version of the Edge and a seven-passenger version of the Edge that are being manufactured by its Changan Joint Venture. Further, the Everest SUV recently went into production. The Everest is a mid-size SUV based on the platform of Ford's Ranger pickup, and is equipped with off-road capabilities. Most of Ford's offerings in China, at present, are suitable for urban uses only. Thus, the new Everest SUV should prove to be an appropriate model at this time to complement the company's existing lineup. Ford already sells the Kuga, EcoSport, and Explorer SUVs in China, and by adding 3 new SUVs, the company is giving itself a stronger chance of capitalizing on this growth segment. Moreover, since SUVs generally carry higher margins , a growing SUV market will help Ford offset the headwinds that it is facing in China. Another segment that Ford is targeting in China is the budget-conscious families. The Ford Escort, which is an entry-level vehicle positioned between the Ford Fiesta and Ford Focus, was launched recently. It carries a conservative style and is equipped with a spacious backseat to strike a chord with its target customers. On the other hand, although Ford's focus area in China is the SUV segment, the company believes that there is potential in the premium segment too. The company is already selling its luxury vehicle Lincoln in China since late last year, and plans to open eight Lincoln retail outlets in seven different cities in the region. Considering the fact that the Chinese luxury vehicle market is anticipated to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 12% till 2020, I think Ford is doing the right thing by focusing on this segment. Apart from Lincoln, Ford has also launched its new flagship sedan, the Taurus . In the next few months, the Taurus will be produced by the Changan Ford joint venture and will carry the nameplate of "Golden Bull." It will be positioned as a vehicle for "self-made and successful business people." Moreover, this model has been designed exclusively for the Chinese market. Despite headwinds in China, Ford is taking smart steps to counter the problems. It is getting more aggressive in the SUV market and also focusing on the luxury brands in an effort to tap the growth hotspots in the Chinese market. As a result, I think that Ford will be able to make a comeback in China in the coming quarters, and since the country accounts for almost one-fifth of its global sales, growth over here will have a positive bearing on its financials.
