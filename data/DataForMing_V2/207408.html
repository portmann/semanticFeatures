Did Delta Air Lines Just Kill The Boeing Party? - The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) | Seeking Alpha Stone Fox Capital , Stone Fox Capital (1,604 clicks) The Delta Air Lines CEO claims the wide-body plane market is in a bubble. Boeing maintains a large order book and production tilted towards the narrow-body 737. During the Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL ) earnings call , the CEO took the opportunity to kill the investment thesis in Boeing (NYSE: BA ). The airline manufacturer is set up for years of strong free cash flow due to a substantial order backlog, but now questions abound regarding the quality of those orders. Delta Air Lines though appears to question the strength of that backlog by suggesting that the markets for airplanes are in a bubble. The CEO specifically mentions on the Q3 earnings call an issue with wide-body planes and goes further to suggest that narrow-body planes will eventually face a similar fate. Well we're seeing a huge bubble in excess wide-body airplanes around the world and we've been approached by more than one party. I mean the market appears to be the 777-200s about 9 to 10 years old the price is about $10 million. And on A330-200 the lease rate is about a fifth of what it would be new. So we do think that the aircraft market is going to be right for Delta and over the course of the next 12 to 36 months and we think that weakness in that aircraft bubble in wide-bodies is going to spread to narrow-bodies and that there will be some huge buying opportunities because low interest rates really have created a huge wide-body bubble in the world. Singapore Airlines, I think has 70 of these airplanes that are coming off lease or being retired that are 8 to 10 years old. He later explains that not many people can take on a substantial amount of 777s, but it doesn't really explain the discrepancy between the large backlogs at the airplane manufacturers and the statements by the CEO of Delta. According to reports from Boeing, the majority of the unfilled orders are for the narrow-body 737 plane. Of the 5,656 planes on order as of the end of September, 4,243 planes are related to this model. The 777 mentioned by the Delta CEO is only 541 of the airplanes on back order, or less than 10%. The perplexing part is that the Delta CEO claims that the narrow-body market will hit a favorable point in the next year, yet China recently ordered 300 planes. The deal includes 50 wide-body aircraft though the majority of the planes are the 737s. The country wouldn't order planes if the market for used planes was so favorable. Or more importantly, the cheap prices on used planes today isn't good enough to pass up new planes that won't be delivered in five years. Remember that theses cheap used planes today, will be 15+ years old by the time China needs the new planes recently ordered. Along with the Chinese order, Boeing made a commitment to increase the 737 monthly production up to 52 airplanes per month in 2018, up from only 42 planes per month now. The production levels pale in comparison to the roughly 8 777s produced on a monthly basis. The news doesn't appear to impact the free cash flow levels that Boeing is on pace to generate over the next few years. If anything, it highlights the demand is shifting further towards modern, fuel-efficient planes over used ones. Either way, lower stock prices only add to the ability of Boeing to repurchase shares on dips. A stock with such a strong buyback plan somewhat welcomes dips in the stock price. The current net payout yields (dividend yield plus net stock buyback yield) sits around 10%. At $137, the stock is down roughly $20 from highs to start the year. Investors even get a solid 2.7% dividend to help with the volatility from these bubble concerns. The key takeaway is that the Delta CEO is talking his book and describing a used plane market that isn't as strong as the new planes. The market shift towards modern, fuel-efficient planes is clearly having an impact on used plane pricing, but it isn't likely to impact current Boeing production rates. Also don't forget that a lot of the orders on the books for Boeing aren't scheduled for delivery until dates at which a cheap used plane today doesn't offer a replacement value. Possibly Delta is smart to go the cheaper route with used planes, but the strong cash flows of many global airlines provide the opportunity to modernize fleets that were recently outdated. Investors need to relax and buy this global airplane manufacturer on the dips. The party is far from over. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
