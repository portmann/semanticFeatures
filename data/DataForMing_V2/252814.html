Micron Technology (MU) Presents at Credit Suisse 19th Annual Technology, Media & Telecom Brokers Conference (Transcript) | Seeking Alpha The clock is counting down so I think that means I am the first to start. I’d like to welcome everyone this afternoon to the presentation with Micron Technology. It’s my pleasure to introduce to my immediate left Ernie Maddock, who is the Chief Financial Officer of Micron. We’ve got a fireside chat format here this afternoon. I’ll kick things off with some questions but if you have any questions we’ve got a mic circulating, so please raise your hand and we’ll get to you. And I think Ernie with that we had dinner last night with a group of investors and I think one of the key questions that was asked is, help us understand all the pieces on the memory chessboard right now? You’ve got the Chinese, you’ve got Intel with Dalian, you’ve got ShinHwa, you’ve got Feng Tao [ph]. It seems like there is a lot of pieces on the memory chessboard that are moving right now, I think a lot of investors are trying to understand what the Micron strategy is in lieu of all this movement. So the way I would characterize the strategy is we want to continue to ensure market access in China and we also want to continue to ensure access to capital markets, and if we have both of those things then that would really inform the specific actions that we were taking as we talked a lot about last night. You can get into a 100 different scenarios, what if this happens and that happens, and I think you can get wrapped up in this or you can step back and say listen the Company has survived in the industry that has been very dynamic since its inception. And so it’s not reasonable to think that somehow a Company that learned how to survive and prosper in the midst of that would somehow loose that muscle memory in the circumstances where in fact you have maybe a slightly different chessboard, maybe it’s a little more difficult to understand. But listen, it’s not as if our competitors hand us a playbook everyday of what their plans are and their technology roadmaps are and somehow we take that playbook and capitalize on it. The situation particularly with respect to China is not so different than the environment the Company has been operating in for some time. So, while I acknowledge there is a lot of moving pieces and a lot of things in the news, at the end of the day it’s really important to separate what you’re reading from what reality is and if you’re reading something that causes you to scratch your head then read a little deeper and understand a little deeper and you’ll begin to understand a lot of this is about positioning and trying to create a perspective on an ability or a desire that may not necessarily be backed up fully with the capability. You’ve been around for a while I think one of the concerns that investors have is, historically whenever there has been a new sovereign entrance into the semiconductor business, it tends to be great for your old job on the equipment side of it and not so good for the memory players and whether that was Japan in the 80s, Korea in the 90s, Taiwan. What’s different now about the memory industry that makes a new sovereign entrant less of a threat or less viable within the memory market? With that historical perspective I think the thing that’s a little bit different is a recognition that without the complete access to the IP, the knowhow, the capability, the prognosis for success is pretty low. And I think that it may have taken a while for anyone to learn that but if you look at each one of the examples you specified, at the end of the day they lacked one of those things that although they may have made a splash it eventually led to an unhappy outcome. And certainly a lot of what you read in the press suggests that there has been learning associated with that which is why the approach is quite different. This isn’t about building a fab and creating employment, this is about having knowledge and access to IP and that IP is actually fairly closely held, different players in DRAM versus NAND, but that IP is actually fairly closely held and although it is not impossible to create it from scratch, the road is a very bumpy one and certainly experience would suggest that that may not be the path you chose to take. Another change late in the memory market has been Intel’s Dalian announcement, 1.5 billion in CapEx next year 5 billion over the life of that fab. If you go back it was in six years ago where they were restructuring their business and giving you more capacity to try to minimize the impact of NAND on their financials and now they seem to be moving in an opposite direction. It’s a little odd of us to kind of question, just how strong is the relationship between Micron and Intel and the JV? Give us your perspective. Our perspective is the partnership is still quite strong. I think it's important to remember that the IP that's developed within the partnership can be used by the either partner for their own means and their own end and certainly we don't question Intel’s decision to provide some captive capacity for NAND. I think their public comments and investment levels sort of suggests in fact that it's very consistent with the idea that they view memory as strategically important, so there has been no surprises there for us. It should not be construed that the partnership is in some way, shape or form jeopardized, still a great partner. We continue to co-invest with them on new technology and so we really view this as a very ordinary course of events, Micron expanded its capability with fab 10 in Singapore and Intel is doing things that it feels are in the best interest of their needs and I don’t think anybody should construe this that the partnership is somewhat weakened or that we're going our separate ways. Ernie, as Dalian ramps, how much of your capacity for NAND do you think you'll be providing to Intel versus today and to the extent that it's less, where can you repurpose that NAND capacity and will we actually be able to repurpose it at higher margin? I think that's possibilities is just -- we don’t ever disclose specifically how much we're supplying, but we did release information relating to the new supply agreements probably now 2 or 3 months ago, but certainly we have an ambition to enter end markets that we think absolutely have the potentials for allowing us some gross margin expansion there. The relationship with Intel helps us mitigate the risk of our fab expansion and we think actually the transition has the potential to be quite orderly as our ability to address end markets ramps up, maybe there ability to supply and their own account from Dalian mitigate some of the demand from our side. So again we weren't surprised, we feel this is sort of part of the ordinary course of business. Most of the questions last time had been -- were focused on NAND and clearly if you go out over the next 3 to 5 years that's probably a bigger growth driver than DRAM. I think we've got about 1.5 into a 2 hour diner before the first DRAM question came out. I am going to start with DRAM, it's still the vast majority of your revenue and if you look over the next 1 to 2 years, probably one of the bigger driver of financials at least in the near term. Talk to us a little bit about the 20 nanometer transition, how is that going, how should we think that unfolds over the next several quarters? Right, so we've talked about the fact that sort of by the middle of next year, it's going to represent more than a majority of our DRAM capability. The ramp is going quite well and Inotera is certainly effectively making that transition and we're continuing with CapEx investments that we have planned for 2016 -- fiscal 2016, to fully get that capability in place as well as planned for the next generation. So that transition in addition to the renegotiation of the Inotera agreement that we've talked about which will have beneficial impact to the Company's margin structure as we get into the middle of calendar ’16, both of those things should give us some nice tailwinds in the business as we look at the year unfolding. One of the interesting things about the DRAM dynamic last quarter for you is that you were somewhat insulated from market trends, I know some that of that is due to the fact that PC DRAM is now what 20% of the business, so you got to good mix. Can you just talk about the mix of DRAM and the profitability of those mixes and how that might be insulating you from current pricing dynamics in the market? Sure, we don't disclose segment profitability, but I think it's fair to say that as long as the PC market looks the way it looks we're going to continue to look elsewhere for profitable outlets for our DRAM capacity. And in some cases, those markets may provide gross margin opportunities greater than and in some cases they might be equal and in extreme they might be slightly less; however we feel they represent longer term opportunities. So it really is sort of a full menu of results and options for us. But net-net the company continues to look for ways to maximize its strategic positioning even if that means in the short-term that we may sub-optimize profitability for a quarter so while we make that happen. The other significant then in your DRAM business as you get into the new calendar year is the renegotiation of the Inotera agreement. I think a lot of investors -- because that agreement is somewhat opaque for obvious reasons to us at least, are trying to understand how current market pricing might impact the benefit of the renegotiation of the Inotera contract. So help us understand what kind of margin upside you think Micron will get at current market prices and how that will sort of differ relative to what the market does overall? Sure, so I think the way I would characterize it and have characterized it is, over any reasonable set of expectations on pricing, it's fair to think that on the Inotera portion of the output it’s an upper single digit benefit, in the aggregate DRAM business probably somewhere in the low to mid-single digits and unless you presume a pretty apocalyptic environment relative to pricing that general rule still holds. Switching over to the NAND side of the business and this is going through a transition to 3D. If you look at your planar business, you were always somewhat sub-scale, you were always somewhat the high cost producer, how do you see sort of relative cost as the world transitions to 3D and you guys are clearly taking -- you and Intel combined together are taking a different architectural approach going with floating gate versus charge trap, how should we as investors think about the impact to your relative cost by making that architectural shift? Certainly as we transition to our first generation of 3D, this is not a particularly easy transition. It’s going well, don’t mean to cause concern by that comment. But if you look at the net cost reduction, the aggregate rule of thumb is, you’d see somewhere around half of the bit output increase conversely applied to pricing. So as soon as we sort of get through the initial transitions in the ramp, I think that that map still holds and I think for us there is particular benefit as we move into the second generation of 3D which is coming not too far behind our first implementation of 3D. We will probably get incrementally more benefit on that second generation than we do on the first. But we would still expect to see a meaningful cost reduction as we transition to the first generation. Do you think you will be the low cost producer, should we think about it more in terms of the gap today is going to close significantly as you move to 3D? I think the latter is probably better. We are not in a position to say we believe we are going to be the cost leader. But certainly we are going to be in the same lap of the racetrack with the cost leader, if not the cost leader. And so we are very comfortable with how we will be positioned as we move forward into the 3D realm. And then last night on the demand side. We spent a lot of time talking about SSDs and the growth in the SSD market. I wonder if you can talk a little bit about sort of the controller technology because clearly that’s going to be a critical part of the value that you will be able to extract in an SSD solution. And I think for a lot of this us it’s difficult to judge, everyone says their controller technology is great. What’s your take on kind of your competitive positioning on controller technology for SSDs? It’s one of the three strategic priorities for the company, the other two being the transition to 20 nanometer DRAM in next generation and the second being the transition to 3D NAND and preparatory work for the subsequent generation. We recently announced the acquisition of Tidal Systems which we feel provides a fantastic foundation around which to continue to develop our controller architecture. So we are comfortable relative to all the pieces that will need to be in place to meaningful enter the SSD market that between the NAND technology and the controller capability, we see that all coming together to allow us to be competitive in that space, how we talk about it absolutely relative to the capability of others is always a challenging feat. Does your ability to get into the enterprise market change with the recent acquisition announced by Western Digital or help me understand how that acquisition impacts your competitive positioning, if at all? Depending on what scenario you want to play out there right, arguably nothing has changed and you can make a case where you say, wow everything has changed. At the end of the day Western Digital plays in that space, will continue to play in that space and they now have access to a supplier of NAND arguably at cost and they’ve traded off paying for the unit cost with a, gee I bought a company, and pay the significant premium for it. So we don’t see that in and of itself as changing the landscape. If you want to get into game theory and suggest that there is going to be rapid proliferation of NAND output as a result of that transaction then everything gets worst for everyone, right because when you have supply exceeding demand we all know what the impact of that is, but we wouldn't -- we don’t foresee that at least as we understand the environment now. Do you guys anticipate Intel maybe having different motivations with their memory business and maybe everyone else in memory does, i.e, if they see a path to selling more processors, selling higher end processors and FPGAs with Altera, aren’t they somewhat incented on money levels to really kill the overall cost of memory in a system? I mean I could see it being very bad for Western Digital’s hard drive business, I could see it being bad for the memory guys because they will trade off margin there for profit dollars in their core business. Why isn't that a reasonable risk as we kind of go forward over the next couple of years? It's impossible to say that it isn't, but by the same token, right they’d actually be destroying the value of the IP that they’ve created and they would essentially be devaluating the investments that they are making and plan to make. So it feels very different when you actually have significant skin in the game which with the investment they have made at Dalian they will. Nonetheless that may still be ultimately what they chose to do, but those are questions better addressed to them rather than to us. With respect to 3D XPoint, I am curious about how you envision approaching the market? My guess is Intel will try and do something with respect to their processors and integrating there. Is your view that you would maybe sum up how you view approach the market with that? We haven’t really talked about that because we’re still in the process of actually working our way through that. So I think as we exit this year I think you’d expect to see us become a little more clear about those plans, but for the moment we’re in the formulation process of that and haven’t talked much about that publicly. Ernie, can you give a rehash of the current situation with Lehi between you and Intel in terms of the put option that you have as well as what they have and how that may have factored into Intel’s thought on investing Dalian fab? Well, I can certainly comment on the facts of the case. Again I can’t describe how that might have impacted Intel’s motivation those are questions best addressed to them. But essentially Intel has the right to put and Micron has the right to call the capacity associated with that fab. That does not impact the R&D JV and it’s sort of unreasonable to think that even though we possess that capability that we would chose to do that within the context of the partnership as it exists today which is healthy and thriving. So, both options exists and I can’t really speak to how that may have influenced Intel’s decision to expand capacity in China. Ernie one question on China, your two major memory competitors have fabs in China, Micron does not. Is there something you could do there locally firstly, or are you thinking about that? And secondly, could you do something like a Inotera relationship on the NAND side with a Chinese company that could do like almost like a contract manufacturing for you. Is that something that is allowed in your relationship with Intel or does that require replaying from Intel? So firstly with respect to the fact that Micron has no fab presence in China, that is true however we have a pretty significant backend presence in China. And thus far at least, again if you go back to the fairly simple perspective that we want to do the things necessary to continue to ensure market access, having a fab in China has not seemed to provide advantages to folks who do, relative to that market access and certainly with our announcement of the fab expansion in Singapore relatively to NAND, we have pretty much cast our bets relative to NAND capacity for at least the next few years. Relative to whether it would be possible to do an Inotera like arrangement, again if it involves the transfer of IP then it would require Intel’s agreement and Intel’s consent. I am not so completely familiar with the JV to understand that if we were allowing someone to use the IP solely on our behalf whether or not that would require their permission, my suspicion is it likely would be. And again given the sensitivity around having access to IP there and what the likely outcome is, it would be a really long contemplated decision on our part. Ernie clearly the memory market is different than it’s historically been albeit it’s still cyclical given the earnings trajectory you’ve had over the last 12 months. Can you help us understand as you sit here today when you look at your competitors and the CapEx budgets for next year? How worried should we be about oversupply both in the DRAM market and the NAND market, I think there is two very different dynamics going on in DRAM versus NAND. So I guess if you could answer the question on both fronts I’d appreciate it. Sure, so if you look at the DRAM front based upon what we’ve talked about and the public announcement of our competitors it feels very much like folks are focused on technology transition that has a relatively predictable outcome in terms of bit supplied and as we look at bits demanded which we think for DRAM next year are kind of in the mid-20s, it doesn’t appear as if there is going to be a significant imbalance there. It’s not as if there are going to be high 30s bit supplied and mid-20s bits demanded, we would think it sort of the high end of what folks have talked about, you’d see mid-20s bit supplied at the lower end with more modest CapEx budget should probably see lower 20s. So that feels as if it’s in relative balance on the NAND side, we think the story is a little bit different, we think bit demand is going to grow somewhere in the mid-30s, and if you look at bit supply, it feels as if that is also imbalanced based on everything that we've talked about and in the public commentary of others, that's not to say that there will be perfect symmetry over the course of the year, in our case we've talked about the fact our bits supply would be predominantly oriented more to the back half rather than the front half. I know there has been several questions asked about, boy are we going to see an expansion of bits supply in DRAM into a seasonally weak period, but again as it relates to Micron, more of our bits supply is going to be coming online towards the end of the year. So based on everything that we know and understand, we don't foresee there to be significant imbalances on either front, albeit you may see quarterly -- a little quarterly irregularities but that's easily managed. On the NAND demand front at least for next year, how important is the smartphone market? And the reason why I ask is, the largest consumer of NAND in the world is Apple and they're coming off two fiscal years of very strong unit [ph] growth of over 20%. This year that was also positively impacted by content growth, I mean, you could paint a scenario where Apple is more flattish next year than up and so when you think about that 30% plus demand environment for NAND next year, what's baked in there handset market versus other things like SSDs really starting to accelerate? So we would look at mobile which is bigger than just handset and say on a unit count basis, fairly flat, but on a constant basis there is room for significant growth, right. So somewhere around the 30% to 50% content growth, handsets in particular we do not have a very aggressive view of unit expansion, however, you know content particularly on low end smartphones still has a lot of upside in it. Great with that I think we've ended our session in this room. Ernie, I wants to thank you for your time this afternoon as well as everyone who joined us. Ernie, thank you.
