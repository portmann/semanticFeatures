While Amazon continues to deflect criticism of its workplace culture , the retailer announced plans to nearly double its workforce this holiday season: adding 100,000 temporary workers to its roster. The new short-term employees will join about 90,000 current workers ( human and robot ) at the company’s 70 warehouses and shipping hubs around the country, CNBC reports . Amazon executives say the temporary positions are in addition to the recently added 25,000 jobs the company filled in recent months. While the holiday season is still a few months away, many national retailers are bulking up their seasonal employee roster to ensure customers find what they need and orders are filled without issue. MLive reported ?last week that seasonal hiring has already kicked off for retailers across the country and many are seeking more help than last year: Target expects to hire 70,000 additional workers, while Macy?s set the bar at 85,000 and Kohl?s plans to add about 79,160 people. As for the shipping gang, MLive reports that FedEx plans to hire 55,000 drivers and sorters, while UPS will add 95,000 short-term employees.
