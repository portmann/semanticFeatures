The Potential Disney Stock Catalyst Nobody Saw Coming - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Zoolopia is an unexpected surprise that could prove quite lucrative for shareholders. If the trend continues, it would give DIS yet another blockbuster like Frozen. The best stock catalysts are those nobody sees coming. In regards to Disney (NYSE: DIS ), its latest Star Wars was an absolute blockbuster, one of the highest grossing movies of all-time. Yet, shares of Disney stock fell, while Star Wars was breaking records. My best guess is Wall Street expected the success, and had already priced it into the stock. Albeit, there is another side of the equation, and that is unexpected success. The best example with Disney is Frozen, a film that achieved box office sales of more than $1.2 billion. As a result of this global success, Frozen went on to become an absolute goldmine for Disney's Studio and Consumer Products businesses. And best of all, the Frozen effect won't end any time soon. Now that Disney has achieved this short-term success, it will go on to incorporate Frozen into its Parks business, and also to film additional installments of Frozen, which too could become billion dollar movies. That said, by the end of February 2015, Frozen had been Studio and Consumer Products success for three months strong, having nearly reached the billion dollar box office mark. Morgan Stanley concluded that by this time, the success of Frozen had already added $14 billion in market capitalization to Disney. That pushed Disney stock over $80 and, of course it continued past $120 later that year, likely a reaction to Star Wars's expected blockbuster success. Given the difference in stock response to these two scenarios - A) when the market expects and B) when the market does not expect - we can conclude the latter rewards long-term investors of DIS. This is particularly good news, because it is very possible Disney just found its next Frozen. I am talking about Zootopia, the animated film that generated $73.7 million in its opening weekend. That is nearly 10% higher sales than Frozen achieved in its opening weekend, which broke the same record back in late 2014. With that said, Zootopia is still a long ways off from being the next Frozen, but one can not deny its immediate success, nor can we ignore the marketability of its main characters and theme. Now, if you are a day over 10-years old, then you're likely not too excited about a film that follows a bunny cop and a con artist fox who pair up to solve mysteries. However, the animated characters likely have strong Consumer Products appeal for Disney, and the mystery-focused theme creates a scenario for more "mysteries" to follow in the form of Zootopia 2, 3, even 4 down the road. Seeing how the success of Zootopia was completely unforeseen, there is limited market value to reflect its box office performance. Even if Zootopia does not reach Frozen status, it is tough to argue that it won't get close to the blockbuster mark, which in that case, could mean $10 billion for DIS stock value (based on Morgan Stanley's market value for Frozen). With all things considered, Zootopia's success is fantastic news for DIS longs, and not just because of the $10 billion, or upwards of $15 billion in market cap it could eventually create for Disney stock value. Remember, Frozen did not cause an overnight rally in DIS stock, it was sustained, gains over time. I suspect that Zootopia will result in the same kind of multi-month gains that come when a media company like Disney has an unexpected box office success. Perhaps the best news of all, Zootopia adds yet another element to Disney's seemingly unstoppable box office arsenal. This includes Marvel, Star Wars, Frozen, and now potentially Zootopia. Each of these films will have multiple installments to follow, all of which have the potential, if not the expectations for blockbuster sales status with each installment. Collectively, this means better shareholder sentiment, and returns that well exceed $10 billion in market capitalization gains. In other words, Zootopia's success is a much bigger deal than most investors realize. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
