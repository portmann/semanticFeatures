Pickup Truck Wars: GM Vs Ford Vs FCA Vs Toyota Vs Nissan - General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) | Seeking Alpha US pickup truck market grew 7% in 2016 and on track for 2.6 million. Over 15% of the entire light vehicle market. GM remains market share leader, but Ford gained in 2016, as did Nissan. The smaller pickup truck size is growing the fastest, in terms of sales, suggesting new buyers switching from sedans and other cars. Diesels are gaining market share, and Android Auto, Apple CarPlay and 4G LTE are introduced into the infotainment systems. I review the actual products and provide my top five pickup truck recommendations. It's time to talk about what makes the U.S. light vehicle market distinctly American: The widespread use of the pickup truck, mostly by people who are not transporting cargo in the bed. The personal pickup truck is as American as the Texas cowboy hat. The other thing that's as American as apple pie are discounts. My favorite part of the purchase process is going to the auto dealer and haggle for the lowest price. As you can see from the latest analysis , average pickup truck discounts can approach $10,000 per vehicle. All of that discounting has yielded a large and growing market, from a unit sales perspective. The half-year U.S. unit sales statistics are in, and the market -- which consists of twelve models -- looks like this: As you can see in the table above, the market grew 7% from the previous year. Sales came in just below 1.3 million, so full-year sales should hit 2.6 million at this pace. That's little over 15% of an overall U.S. light vehicle market of 17 million. We also see that the Ford (NYSE: F ) F-Series was the most important vehicle in terms of growth -- in absolute units. Others grew more on a percentage basis, but nobody came close to the Ford F-Series in terms of overall market importance. The other thing to understand is that while some companies such as Ford and FCA (NYSE: FCAU ) classify their pickup trucks under one major model name, others such as GM (NYSE: GM ), Toyota (NYSE: TM ) and Nissan ( OTCPK:NSANY ) don't. They have different sizes, and in GM's case two brands for each size (Chevrolet and GMC), for a total of four, in GM's case. As you can see in the table above, while the Ford F-Series is the market leader by far, GM's four models combined out-sell the Ford F-Series. GM's market share is 35% compared to Ford's 31%. FCA is third at 18% followed by Toyota at 12%. Over the last year or so, I have driven some variant of almost all of these pickup trucks. The major exceptions are the Nissan Frontier and Honda Ridgeline. Keep in mind that there are numerous variants of most of these trucks -- different engines, different cab sizes, different trim levels, on-road, off-road, etc. In some cases, I drove multiple variants of each; in others not. GM is the largest player overall, and it competes in both size-classes. It's also the only one that offers a diesel version of the smaller truck. The diesel puts it on par with the best fuel economy of any truck -- up to 29 MPG depending on the version. GM's basic pickup designs are some of the older. It shows in some of the electronics, such as the ignition which is not wireless, the foot parking brake, and that the steering wheel in the full-size truck doesn't telescope. That said, GM has also updated its trucks with some of the most important electronics. Specifically, it was the first to implement Android (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Auto, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) CarPlay, 4G LTE and WiFi hotspot. GM's OnStar also remains unmatched. I find the steering and overall precision in the handling, to be superior in the GM trucks -- full-size and small alike. From a driving dynamics standpoint, it's the least "truck-like" and most resembling a car or at least a smaller SUV, in a good way. Ford's F-Series is the second-newest design in the segment, and it's a very modern one with the latest in most feature areas. The optional upgraded seat is the best, and the sheer amount of features is bewildering in a good way. Soon enough, the F-Series will also get Android Auto, Apple CarPlay and 4G LTE. FCA's main calling card with the RAM is that it has the only diesel for the half-ton "1500" truck segment. This makes for superior fuel economy at up to 29 MPG. FCA is on a path to get an updated infotainment system that's got Android Auto, Apple CarPlay and 4G LTE, but I don't know when it will be. Certainly not in the next few short months. It could be a year away, or perhaps two or three years in a worst-case scenario. We may find out next year. I drove the two Toyota pickup trucks and I was not impressed. They felt noticeably rough and feature-poor compared to most of what GM, Ford, FCA and Nissan's Titan HD had to offer. The seats weren't particularly comfortable, the driveline felt un-smooth, and all the electronics were light-years behind GM in particular. Toyota lives on its superior quality reputation, and the Tundra wasn't quite as unimpressive to me as the smaller Tacoma -- but still, they were simply not in the same class as those other trucks from the other brands. Toyota has a lot of work to catch up. Nissan has an impressive offering in the new Titan XD diesel. That's the only version of any Nissan truck I have driven in recent years. It's got a 5 liter V8 diesel made by Cummins, yielding a massive 555 lb ft of torque at extremely low RPM -- but it's available only in a beefier truck in the three-quarter ("2500") class. The Nissan is a modern, but still masculine and classy at the same time, design statement. The interior is a very tasteful mix of car and truck. If you want the most sophisticated look inside a pickup truck, look no further than the Nissan Titan XD diesel in Platinum Reserve trim. The only real downside I could find with the Nissan Titan XD is the lack of Android Auto, Apple CarPlay and embedded 4G LTE. Nissan just started equipping its first car -- the Maxima -- with Apple CarPlay, so perhaps there is hope for the Titan in the months to come. As for Honda? I simply haven't driven the all-new Ridgeline yet. It's arriving in dealerships now, and is getting strong reviews. It has Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. It's also a very different kind of truck than all the others, given that it's a unibody design -- not body-on-frame. What makes a pickup truck fundamentally different to drive, compared to an otherwise equivalent large SUV? That is, except from the obvious bed. Well, a truck is meant to support more weight in the back -- if you fill it up. However, when you drive it without any significant load back there, the suspension will be extremely stiff. Bumps may not be kind to your kidneys. The stiffness becomes exacerbated with the latest fashion in pickup trucks -- equipping them with 20 or even 22 inch wheels. That means very little sidewall for the tires. As a result, the ride becomes extra-stiff. This will be very tedious for people who drive their trucks without anything heavy in the bed, or who don't tow. The solution to this fundamental truck problem is to make sure you get your truck with wheels that are 18 inches or less, depending on the truck's size. If you do, you will get a much more comfortable ride, making it feel more like a regular large body-on-frame SUV. My newest favorite is the GMC Sierra All-Terrain X. On this full-size truck, GM removed all chrome and made it Darth-Vader all-black. It looks like the Zombie Apocalypse truck. Many people fear you in traffic. The tires are beefy 18 inch off-roaders, and it rides like a dream -- very cushy and confident. Fuel economy is acceptable for such a 365 horsepower 5.3 liter gasoline V8 beast at 15 MPG city, 21 MPG highway. At little over $53,000 before discounts, reasonably equipped, it's not a bad deal given this extremely tasteful package that makes you feel good both driving it and looking at it. GMC is also offering huge discounts right now. The GMC Canyon is essentially the same vehicle as the Chevrolet Colorado. It's got the best electronics, handling, fuel economy, and is the least difficult to park. The configuration you want is going to be over $41,000 before discounts. The only fly in the ointment right now is that GMC isn't discounting it very much, making the larger Sierra a better buy. Modernity and features abound. What it lacks is a diesel for the "1500" half-ton class, as well as embedded LTE. Android Auto and Apple CarPlay either just arrived, or will soon be arriving as a software update. I find the steering a bit light/vague, but on the whole the new SYNC-3 infotainment system took away the remaining obstacle from recommending this best-selling truck. The kind of configurations I want start at anywhere from $47,000 to $63,000 before discounts. This is for the guy who would like to tow up to 12,300 lbs, and for whom a modern and sophisticated interior design is important. The configuration you want is going to be at least $58,000 before discounts. This may not be the ideal pickup truck unless you have serious towing needs. There is one rationale for buying the RAM 1500 today, and that's its excellent diesel engine, which is the sole one of kind and in its weight class. In perhaps another year or two, RAM will also have solved the infotainment issue, currently lacking Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. You can configure it for less, but I see a great luxurious configuration starting around $53,000 before significant discounts. Summary: A large and lucrative vehicle market So there you have it, these are my favorite three pickup trucks in the U.S. market right now. The market grew 7% in the first half of 2016, and GM remains the largest player despite Ford getting all the headlines for the F-Series. Disclosure: I am/we are long FCAU, GOOGL.
