Why It Makes No Sense For Apple To Buy Netflix - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha The rumors surrounding Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) buying Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) just don't go away. They have been circulating again this past week. In fact, they have been circulating for years. Back in March 2014 this article found on thestreet.com suggested the merits of the merger. Back when the article was written the main thesis was that a 30% premium from the than current $22 billion "would get the deal done." Two years later the market cap of Netflix is $44 billion. So what makes the deal more appealing now? With a price tag of twice as much? In this article I am going to go on record as saying that there is no benefit at all to Apple buying Netflix. Why? Netflix is facing their own struggles with competition such as Hulu The Netflix business is platform agnostic If the deal was not appealing to Apple at $22 billion it will hardly be appealing with a $44 billion market cap (and that is before a premium is offered to make the deal attractive to NFLX shareholders.) Now don't get me wrong. I think that Apple should and will make a mega merger. Earlier this month I wrote an article suggesting the benefits of Apple buying a few companies that have seen tough times and have seen their stocks get beaten down. When I wrote the article I thought that I would receive tons of negative comments, but interestingly, I was wrong. I think that people are finally realizing the logic of Apple growing via acquisition and at the same time using some of their cash hoard. But Netflix is not the right choice. Or fit. There is no comparison. Per the SEC Annual Reports filed by both companies, Apple's balance sheet saw more than $7 billion increase in cash and cash equivalents added in their last fiscal year. Netflix on the other hand witnessed a negative $920 million free cash flow exodus in their latest fiscal year. Net Income as a Percentage of Revenues Netflix operates on relatively thin margins. In their latest fiscal year their net income was just over 1% of revenues, and diminishing. Apple on the other hand had net income of over 22% of revenues. For the past five years the average net income as a percentage of revenues for Netflix was 3.21%. Compare that to Apple's 23.35% five year average. It is clear that there is no financial motivation for Apple to buy Netflix. So we than need to move on to the business advantages of a possible acquisition. There is no doubt about it. Netflix is becoming a victim of their own success. Hulu has mounted an all out attack and is now going head to head with Netflix and gaining traction. In this article, Cade Metzdis does a nice job penning some reasons why Hulu is finally mounting a viable challenge to Netflix. It is noteworthy that Hulu is owned by Comcast's NBC Universal, 21st Century Fox's Fox Broadcasting, and Walt Disney's ABC. The content and financial muscle that backs Hulu should give Netflix supporters serious reason to question their long term growth prospects. Do not misunderstand me. I am not suggesting the downfall of Netflix. I am however suggesting that in the coming years the ability of Netflix to dominate will be tested like it has never been tested before. That is not the backdrop for Apple or any other company to spend $55-60 billion or more to acquire Netflix (the current $44 billion market cap of Netflix plus a buyout premium to entice Netflix shareholders to approve a deal). International regulatory restrictions and irregularities are also a challenge to Netflix as is the fact that in some countries such as Spain NFLX is late to the party and other services are already well entrenched. Both of these obstacles are described in this article co penned by Mark Scott and Elian Peltier. In addition, many of the developed countries of the world (that are prime markets) already have Netflix services. With domestic net addition growth stuck in the low single digits, the focus will continue to be on international growth. While the international division is seeing healthy growth for now , it is still hemorrhaging cash. The international streaming segment witnessed a $333 million contribution loss to earnings. One must also remember that the old but faithful DVD business is fading away on Netflix. As highlighted on page 21 of their 2015 annual report, Domestic DVD revenues were down 16% for 2015 vs 2014. That matches a similar 16% drop for the 2014 vs 2013 period. Profits likewise continue to experience the same pressures. 2015 vs 2014 profits were down 13%, after dropping 16% in the 2014 vs 2013 period. These issues have not been ignored by the analysts. The last few months have seen a slight deterioration in the Recommendation Trends by the analysts: Netflix stock is currently selling at a staggering forward Price Earnings ratio of 98. Not only has any future growth been priced into Netflix shares, so too has a buyout premium. Fellow SA author Frank Isaksen wrote an article this past week detailing his justification for stating that the current price of Netflix already has a 25% buyout premium built into it. It is definitely worth reading. Apple is lucky. They do not NEED to buy anyone at the moment. Their main business is still a cash cow. They have a terrific R&D department, and a top class management team. To buy a company for the sake of buying to increase revenues makes no sense, and to me that is all that would be gained by acquiring Netflix. Netflix is too big to buy. Also,at the current market cap they do not generate enough income to justify being bought out. Apples $55 billion cash and cash equivalents hoard will not and should not be spent on Netflix. But the Netflix bulls already knew that didn't they?
