Dear Ford Motor Company: Sorry I Misunderstood Your Debt For So Long - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford is an iconic car brand, which I have overlooked as an investment for many years. Originally, concerns over its dividend kept me at arms length, then it shifted to concerns over debt levels. F's debt is, however, more complicated than most of its automotive peers. Dig a little deeper and the company's debt load is actually far more attractive; you just need to understand it better. Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F ) has not really featured on my investing watchlist. Part of this is due to my personal circumstances. My relationship with car brands is not, generally, a strong one. I have not (nor plan to any time soon) owned a car myself. I hire cars frequently. Yet, as a result, I can find myself as likely to be sitting behind a Volkswagen ( OTCPK:VLKAY ), General Motors (NYSE: GM ), Toyota (NYSE: TM ), Fiat Chrysler (NYSE: FCAU ) or indeed any number of other brands as much as Ford. Nonetheless, this is not the major reason it has failed to make my watchlist. Prior to the last few years, the chief reason for this absence has been, quite simply, a matter of dividends. Ford's recent record has hardly been stellar: Recent growth has seen it at least catching my eye again. Yet, I have remained turned-off by Ford still. Why? Well, chiefly because each time I have taken the time to look at the business, the debt levels have warned me off. Yet, recently I have had cause to question my historic overlooking of Ford due to its debt. Let me explain why. First, let's take a look at why Ford's debt has previously pushed me away from it. Quite frankly, from a superficial glance, its total debt is not a pretty sight. Mammoth debt levels combined with pretty rapid growth in recent years are not something I like to see. What is more, set against equity levels, it looks even less pretty. A debt-to-equity ratio of over 460% is high on an absolute basis. On a relative basis, it hardly looks any more moderate. Between them, General Motors, Toyota and Fiat Chrysler average a debt-to-equity ratio around the 150% mark. High again, but tiny in comparison to Ford. Yet, there is more to Ford's debt story that needs to be clarified. I need to take the company's advice and "Go Further" with my focus on Ford's debt. Recently, there was a catalyst for a new appreciation of Ford's debt position. A short time ago, my car hire company provided me with a Ford (the first in about three years), and it reminded me I had not looked into the company at all for some time. With Ford's Q4 results freshly out, I sat down and read through the earnings transcript. In it, Ford's CFO Bob Shanks commented that: A number of articles … continue to be written about the very high leverage of Ford Motor Company and generally that point of view is because people are taking this automotive debt, they're adding it to the financial services debt (…) But that's not the way that investors should look at. It's also not the way that the credit rating agencies look at it.… The key one in terms of the leverage of the company and the one that the credit rating agencies look at is … the $12.8 billion [automotive debt] and this is the lowest it's been since 2000 and its representative of a very good leverage position by the company along with where we stand on pensions and other things that the credit rating agencies look at. This got me interested. It is easy to forget that, in reality, Ford is pretty much two companies wrapped into one: Ford Automotive and Ford Credit. "Ford Automotive" is the iconic car manufacturer. "Ford Credit", in contrast, is a financial services company which helps provide auto loans to buy the cars. Ford managed to hold onto its credit business during the nasty auto crisis from 2008 to 2010. The other main US auto-makers were forced to spin-off their auto loans arms. General Motors' finance arm eventually became Ally (NYSE: ALLY ). Fiat Chrysler, in contrast, sold its arm eventually, becoming TD Auto Finance after Toronto-Dominion Bank (NYSE: TD ) purchased it. Needless to say, Ford Credit provides people with loans to help buy Ford cars. Ford Credit builds up debt levels. This debt is used to loan out to customers at a higher interest rate. They then repay their debt, as do Ford Credit keeping the additional interest as profit. And quite some profit. Whilst Automotive pulled in $8.2 billion in income in 2015, Credit pulled in a further $2 billion. Yet, should we really worry too unduly about Ford Credit's debt? After all, is this not "good" debt in that Ford gets back in interest more than it pays on that debt? Ford certainly thinks so. As Shanks added: If you think about Ford Credit, Ford Credit is self-funding, Ford Credit also self-liquidates in a downturn at lower volume. The self-liquidating comment is particularly interesting. In downturns people buy fewer cars. Fewer people buying means, fewer people taking out auto loans. Yet, those already taken out continue to be repaid (except some defaulters). Consequently, new debt provided by Ford Credit slows, yet outstanding debt will continue to decline. Ford Credit's debt therefore winds down. Naturally, the opposite occurs during strong markets for car sales. More sales, more auto loans, higher debt taken at Ford Credit. Consequently, we should expect to see Ford Credit growing debt in strong markets and shrinking debt in weaker ones. Whilst debt may be a blood-sucking presence for Ford Automotive, for Ford Credit, it is a necessary blood-flowing presence. This all has important implications for assessing Ford from a debt perspective. To understand the company's debt health, we need to first separate the debt it holds. So how much of Ford's debt is held by Ford Credit? Well, increasingly the Automotive element of the debt has been shrinking as a proportion of total company debt. Partly this has been due to growing debt at Ford Credit. However, Ford Automotive debt has also been declining noticeably over the same period. Automotive debt - which, as Shanks highlighted, is the measure credit agencies focus upon - is therefore tracking the exact trend I like to see for debt: down. Taken by itself, the debt-to-equity ratio for Ford Automotive is down to under 45% after being at just shy of 90% in 2011. This incidentally is much more in line with its car-making peers. Clearly, there is a great deal of nuance hidden in Ford's hefty debt load. Unlike most of its peers which were forced to offload their loan businesses, Ford (which managed just to avoid bankruptcy) was able to hold onto it. Yet, this has made it a peculiar business in its own sector. Debt matters really bring that to the fore. What is clear is that I have been wrong to overlook Ford based on its debt position. Had I taken the time to get passed the superficial figures and ascertain the composition of the debt, I would have no doubt investigated further. Would I invest in Ford right now? As yet, I am not entirely sure. I would have to take the time to do a more in-depth analysis of its performance recently. Yet, this analysis has at least allowed me to see that Ford certainly deserves a more detailed look. Instinctively, I still dislike debt at this level. The company's specific debt situation, however, at least requires me to give this iconic car brand a little more of my research time. It may just pass my investing criteria after all.
