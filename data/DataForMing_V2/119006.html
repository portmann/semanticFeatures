Netflix Surges: 5 Reasons To Consider Taking Some Profits - Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) | Seeking Alpha Netflix rockets off the news of smashing subscriber growth estimates as the company's plan to expand is in full force. Cash flow and net income have both been negatively affected by the company's growth initiatives. Law of large numbers could apply soon. We love Netflix as a company but as an investment it may just be too expensive here. Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) posted earnings on Wednesday that, yet again, the street loved. The stock opened up 10% in trading on Thursday as analysts hiked their priced targets, all happy with the company's subscriber growth. Much like Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ), we think Netflix is a fantastic company with a great product, but we feel that the pricing of the stock may dictate that it's going to be time to take profits soon. In addition to earnings, Netflix is being helped out by its recent split adjustment, which took effect earlier this week. With a lower stock price, retail investors and certain funds are more prone to adding exposure to the company. Subscriber growth has been the main key to watch during NFLX earnings. Both net income and cash flows have taken a back seat while the company continues plowing through its aggressive growth model. "You can't make an omelet without breaking some eggs," right? The market seems to only be focused on the rate at which it is adding new subscribers, but even bullish analysts estimate that NFLX will top out at about 150 million subscribers. Part of this reasoning leads us to believe the valuation could be too far out in front of the fundamentals here. Part of the reason the stock has responded so positively, despite the lack of net income growth, is that the company crushed subscriber growth numbers. They were expected to add 600,000 subscribers in the U.S. and instead they added 900,000. The company also beat on international subscribers, posting 2.37 million vs. estimates of 1.9 million. The company now has 65.55 million members. That aside, we're going to take a look at five reasons we think that taking profits here, and perhaps waiting for a correction, may be the right move to make for those holding Netflix. 1. Cash flow. The company reported FCF of -$229 million vs. expectations of -$59 million. The company is burning through cash quickly as it tries to grow internationally. Netflix has a substantial cash position near $2 billion and so FCF isn't the main focus as it grows, but it's one of a few items that we think needs to be steadied. Management's comments on this were that "negative free cash flow was expected as the company grows internationally. The management team focuses on the ratio of content P&L expense to cash which hovers in the 1.2 to 1.3 range. They expect it to peak at 1.4." 2. Net income. Just like with cash flow, with the company trying to expand internationally, the bottom line is being negatively affected and net income was down substantially YOY. Though hardly a reason to panic at this point, as the company remains profitable while spending to expand its offerings and outreach, we think investors should keep a close eye on the P/L and not lose sight of the company's fundamentals as it grows. Yes, this is a growth story, but at the end of the day we buy stock because we think the company can, over the course of whatever timeframe we're looking at, provide more than what you're paying for it in earnings per share. 3. China isn't moving as planned. China, slated for a 2016 arrival for NFLX, is a monster international market and arguably the most important international move for the company. With a delay in moving into China, however, can the market keep the stock priced for this growth for another two years without any tangible progress? This was CEO Hastings' comments on China, "So China, again, we still have some things to figure out, so I suppose it's possible," he said, but added he was "pretty confident" about the rest of the world. The biggest hurdle, Hastings said in an interview, is securing the required government clearance and partnerships needed to operate in China, a country with strict regulation of media. 4. The valuation is becoming immense and NFLX only has so much more room for subscriber growth. When that ends, the pricing model is going to be key. Please read this fantastic article out yesterday goes into the "law of large numbers" problem that Netflix is going to have moving forward, especially if they don't update their pricing. 5. The market itself is going to have to hold up and support the generous price it has given to NFLX. In the face of rate hikes, China and Greece, we think there are too many factors that could negatively impact U.S. equity markets for us to be confident buying NFLX here. We're not really bona-fide Netflix bears, we're just cautious investors. We like the company and several of us at the office are subscribers ourselves. We just are trying to face the reality that without bumping up pricing right now, with the company in global expansion mode, the stock's high valuation could be bordering on irrational. We don't want to see Netflix catch "the Amazon effect." We'd like to see some quality of earnings eventually, net income and cash flows steady, and the stock pull back before we take a position at these levels. If we were long Netflix heading into this report, we'd consider taking some off the table here.
