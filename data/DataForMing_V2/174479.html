Qualcomm Will See Its SoC Market Share Erode In The Next Few Years - Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) | Seeking Alpha Qualcomm's global royalty share is steadily decreasing while average phone prices are falling. Big customers want to reduce their dependence on Qualcomm. Baseband and application processors' competitiveness will spike in coming years. Qualcomm is overvalued compared to Intel; it's a long-term sell. Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM ) is facing headwinds this year: royalty share is decreasing, technology prominence in 4G and 5G is soft, customers are building their own application processors and the share price looks quite overvalued compared to certain competitors. The company may regain some price value once Snapdragon 820 will be released, if we assume that this SoC will be competitive against competitors, and if we assume that overheating issues are old memories. First of all, the royalty business is a problem not to be underestimated. Qualcomm's customers like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) are pushing to cut royalties fees related to "old" technologies and it looks like this trend is not over at all. Qualcomm has a rich portfolio in the 3G sector but that is not the same for the 4G and 5G sectors. Indeed, its average royalty rate has been decreasing steadily for seven years. Given that the average smartphone price is currently decreasing, royalties are affected because they are generally priced in relation to retail smartphone prices. China also is the source of several issues: 1) Chinese OEMs are underreporting orders, 2) Wang Xiang has been hired by Xiaomi, and 3) Chinese companies are increasingly adopting anti-competitive behaviors. Qualcomm has a high exposure to Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (OTC: SSNLF ) and Apple: the revenues derived from these two companies increased from 38% of 2012 to 49% of 2014, besides which, this supplying share is still rising. It's obvious that such a heavy reliance is not healthy to Qualcomm because an eventual Samsung and Apple detachment from Qualcomm's products would deeply hit revenues and market share. While other companies implemented and heavily criticized the Snapdragon 810, Samsung has directly skipped this SoC due to overheating problems. Tim McDonough (Qualcomm's VP of Marketing) tried to pour oil on troubled waters , stating that customers have simply overestimated the SD810 overheating issues. Every SD810 smartphone faced lower battery life compared to the previous models and competitors' phones. Moreover, certain companies had to lower the TDP to achieve better thermal dissipation. Anandtech has shown that the average power consumption of LG Flex 2 SD810 is higher than previous SD805 typical systems and the same goes for power efficiency. It means indeed that SD810 is a very hot and energy consuming SoC, even if other system components must be considered. Every smartphone faces some kind of thermal throttling, but SD810 throttles quite more than competitors. You can see its behavior here . It is also known that Samsung will probably use both the next SD820 and Exynos ( news 1 - news 2 ) in its high-end offer, but anyhow, it's already clear that Samsung is planning to lower dependence on Qualcomm in the coming years. Obviously, it's not possible to exclude that customers tried to exploit the heat issue to reduce the SoC's price since nearly every customer company loudly complained about it. Speaking about Apple, the company is succeeding in cutting down Qualcomm's royalties and it will likely reduce its dependence on Qualcomm's baseband chips. It may happen because Apple has the tendency to not massively lean on one single company but it prefers to diversify its supplies. Apple has already been switching from Samsung to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (NYSE: TSM ), and vice versa, in application processors, but last reports claimed that Apple is stocking up A9 SoCs from both Samsung and TSMC, pushing them to lower prices. Qualcomm's customers are already showing the will to create their own chips in order to optimize costs and to reduce their dependence on Qualcomm. While some companies already have the know-how to do it, others will be able to in the coming years, starting from 2016: Samsung: Samsung already has demonstrated its ability to build and design excellent SoCs. The Exynos 7420 clearly was the best SoC of 2015 thanks to a good design and to the 14-15nm FinFet production node, made possible by Samsung's high quality foundries. The company implemented the Exynos 7420 to substitute the SD810, therefore Samsung is likely to promote its own offer in the coming years, even if it will still use SD820 in 2016. Samsung will release the 7420 successor next year, a SoC that will be based on the new Mongoose core, a modified ARM A72 architecture. This approach is similar to Apple's Cylone and Qualcomm's Krait and Kryo cores. As you can see in the next image, Samsung's Mongoose M1 provides ace performances compared to the other 2016 competitors. (The posted image below simply collects the various leaked benchmarks discovered on the web. Leaked benchmarks have been very reliable in recent years). Exynos M1 reaches a Geekbench result of 2,136 points in single thread and 7,497 points in multi-threading. Such a powerful SoC would simply crush the competition concerning the CPU part, disregarding the unknown TDP for a while. Considering the high quality design, the provided performances and its foundries' quality, Samsung's products become more and more compelling. Beyond this, the Korean company could also augment its SoCs' employment on different devices, a possible plan supported by the leaked info recently found on the web that shows another Exynos numbered 8890, powering a new device (Samsung Lucky). It will provide a performance similar to Exynos 7420 and it will come with 4GB of DDR. This plan is more credible if we consider that Samsung is supplying its Exynos 7420 to other companies like Meizu, as shown on an Antutu page with the model Niux. It becomes even more credible if we consider recent news that was released on September 15, 2015: The core Ananke that will substitute A53 and A17 (low-end/mid-end) is already being tested and it will be produced in a big.LITTLE package in late 2016. This last info consistently supports old news concerning Samsung's 10nm FinFet node technology . The fact that Samsung is working on mid-low-end SoCs makes it unquestionable that this company wants to exploit its own foundries at full power, maybe to become a major player in the application processors segment. All of this makes me think that Samsung will steal some market share from both Qualcomm and TSMC, implying a remarkable revenue reduction for the U.S. company. Huawei: Huawei owns HiSilicon, which is going to release Kirin 940 and 950 in the coming months. These SoCs will be produced with 16nm node technology and they will provide quite astonishing performances. Given the miniaturization level and the integration of the last ARM GPU Mali T860 and T880 implementation, the Tensilica HiFi 4 (very good DSP) and the dual-sim LTE Cat.10/7 modems, these SoCs are brand new and competitive in every aspect. Considering that this also is a Chinese company with the potential of delivering competitive prices, Huawei is likely to attract a high number of customers, further eroding Qualcomm's revenues. Xiaomi: Xiaomi acquired Leadcore, the fifth SoC Chinese producer. It will release some entry level SoCs to substitute the Qualcomm ones in 2016. Beyond this, Leadcore is planning to gradually use its SoCs even in the mid-end market in the coming years. The LC1860 SoC will power Xiaomi Redmi 2A and provides better performances in comparison to SD410. This shows that this company is already doing a good job with such a small firm. Moreover, Leadcore's SoCs may reduce Qualcomm's revenues coming from the entry level market. LG: LG Electronics Inc. (OTC: LGEAF ) has been designing the Nuclun architecture for two years now. As you have seen in the previous image, Nuclun 2 performs on par to competitors (but well below Mongoose M1). It will be built at TSMC's foundries with the 16nm node technology (like Kirin 940-950), and it will come with an Intel cellular modem and will be massively produced in 2H 2016. Qualcomm will eventually perceive reduced revenues from LG given that the Korean company's most famous and best selling smartphones are Qualcomm powered at the moment. Nvidia: Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA ) has never managed to acquire a relevant market share in the mobile market; moreover, in the smartphone market, its market share is around zero. It's true that Tegra K1 and X1 have astonishing performing GPUs, but the downside is the very high TDP. Given that Nvidia decided to down Icera operations in 2016 , it's clear that the company has a very low impact on competitors' sales. Nvidia will probably concentrate on the automotive, laptop and small PCs markets (media players). MediaTek: MediaTek Inc. is going to release 28nm HPM Helio X10 MT6795 (Octacore A53), which will power some devices from Sony, Meizu, HTC, Elephone, Xiaomi and LeTV, while others will be announced in the coming months. Some of these customers are gradually detaching from the Snapdragon platform and they are likely to continue the trend. Given the production node, it may not provide great efficiency, but the price is compelling and the A53 architecture has intrinsic low power consumption. MediaTek will also release Helio X20 by the end of 2015. It's a tri-cluster composed of 2xA72 - 4xA53 high clock - 4xA53 low clock with a 20nm HPM node technology. Looking at some leaked benchmarks, it looks like this SoC may provide performance comparable to other competitors and lower heat generation. Even if performance benchmarks look reliable, there is some skepticism about heat tests. By the way, this SoC is attracting more and more customers since it seems to power the new HTC A9 flagship smartphone, according to leaked info . Finally, MediaTek will release Helio X30 in 1Q 2016. This SoC will be a tetra-cluster composed of 4xA72 - 2xA53 low clock - 2xA53 mid clock - 2xA53 high clock and it will be produced with a 16nm FINFET node technology, which will provide very high performances on par to Samsung Mongoose M1. It must be considered that Helio X20 and Helio X30 will be updated to the last ARM Mali GPU T880, like Samsung M1. If we consider that these SoCs will be provided with competitive ISPs, modem and other specifics, 2016 will likely see a very high competitiveness in the application processors market. In such a scenario, Qualcomm will probably lose additional market share. Intel: I have already talked about Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) in my previous article , which states that Intel will provide more compelling Atom X SoCs in the next few months. Intel also may release a Core M SoC designed for high-end phablets in coming years, in addition to the Atom Broxton platform powered by Goldmont architecture. Goldmont will probably be aligned to the Kaby Lake development line and it will be provided with Intel Gen 9 HD Graphics refresh. This GPU architecture will provide a massive boost to Intel Atom performances and efficiency. 1) Atom Bay Trail and Cherry Trail development was very slow - it has been left behind in comparison to desktop development. 2) Baseband integration has been delayed to 2016. This issue has been creating enormous problems to Intel, even if it has tried to surpass it by subsidies. In any case, Skylake-Y Core M is being tested on phablets right now. If Intel will be successful in these tests, we could enjoy big changes in the future mobile application processors panorama. Talking of baseband chips, I have already mentioned the LG partnership. Intel looks to be also well set for 5G chips and it has a stake in Spreadtrum, a company which could be useful to penetrate the Chinese market. Baseband features will be directly integrated on Atom SoCs in 2016-2017 in order to exploit 14nm and 10nm nodes. Such integration will provide lower power consumption and more simple logic boards, features that will make Intel SoC a lot more compelling. As for the Intel-Apple relationship, it looks like the first company could provide some new baseband chips to Apple starting from 2016. Such a partnership could directly hit Qualcomm business since Apple is one of its biggest customers. Finally, it must not be forgotten that Intel, Samsung and TSMC will have similar node technologies for 10nm production, but Intel will use a 7nm beol for the 7nm node, instead of TSMC which will still use a 10nm beol. In such a scenario, Intel has the right trump cards to really enter the market and partially steal Qualcomm market share in coming years. The market is giving an evaluation premium to Qualcomm in comparison to its industry sector and one of its competitors, Intel Corporation. This premium may not be justified, given their fundamentals: even if there is no relevant difference in revenue growth and operating margin, other metrics favor Intel a lot. Analysts forecast an average YoY 2016 revenue growth of +4.15% for Intel and -4.87% for Qualcomm. In addition, Qualcomm's price-to-cash flow is hugely higher compared to Intel's. This is quite strange given that the high cash flow has been one of the most important positive metrics in Qualcomm analyses. If we also consider that Intel will increase its mobile market share, while Qualcomm will likely partially lose its own market share, Qualcomm's stock perceives a not justifiable premium of +27.56%. Qualcomm has announced that it will enter the UAV market with its Snapdragon 801. The most positive market forecast predicts a hobby and commercial UAV market around $10 billion within 2020. Even if Qualcomm will manage to replicate its smartphone market share (52%), it would obtain revenue income quite lower than $1 billion in 2020, which simply cannot compensate the other threats I have already mentioned. Moreover, the UAV market will have to face the regulation issue because regulations will probably set "hard" restrictions that would eventually reduce UAV market potential revenues. Qualcomm is probably moving toward difficult years in this second part of the decade. Royalty share is decreasing and the correlated revenues will probably shrink in the coming years due to its relative weakness in the 4G and 5G portfolio. Baseband and application processors segments are likely to go through difficult times due to the rising competitiveness of customers that are more and more willing to design their own SoCs and chips. Big customers tend to diversify their supplies and that is what Samsung and Apple are already doing. Qualcomm may be a short-buy for a speculative action, only if SD820 will be able to perform well without generating overheating issues, and only if its adoption will be fairly good. I cannot say the same for a long-term bet: Qualcomm's market valuation is clearly overvalued against similar companies, primarily in comparison to Intel Corporation. Just starting from P/S, P/E and price-to-cash flow, in relation to the projected revenues and earnings growth, Qualcomm's overvaluation looks glaring. I think that the P/S evaluation could revert in the coming years: a P/E multiple of 10-12X and a P/S multiple of 2.5-3X look feasible, given that Qualcomm could face continuous weakness in revenues and a possible reduction in profitability. With such multiples, Qualcomm would fall at least an additional -20/30% within roughly 2018, while Intel would probably be able to increase its valuation about +30/40% in the same period. Intel's plan could be realized only if the company will be able to attack the smartphone sector and if it will be able to exploit Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) renewed energy. From my point of view, stay away from Qualcomm in the long run, or short it. Get Intel instead.
