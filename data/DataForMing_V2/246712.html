David Einhorn: Questionable Calls? | Seeking Alpha Arboard Value trying everything at Yahoo. Bill Ackman taking the losers average losers approach at Valeant?. This is the questionable calls version of activist investing daily, with a focus on funds making questionable calls of late. David Einhorn pitched CONSOL Energy (NYSE: CNX ) at the Robin Hood conference. This has been a name he's owned for over a year and added to his stake last quarter. Here's Einhorn's presentation on CNX. The biggest issue here is that CNX is a capital (debt) intensive business. It has to raise debt and has a lot of debt on the books - however, Einhorn uses just a weighted average cost of capital of 8.4% in his in his valuation of CNX. Below is the slide from his presentation and then is cost of capital calculation from his website. Notice the 3.5% cost of debt. Starboard Value , once pushing for a Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) spinoff of its Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) stake, is now urging the company to reverse paths and spinoff its core business. In a letter to Yahoo, Starboard outlines its new plan. The spinoff of BABA is too risky right now given the tax uncertainty. Starboard does want a board seat. However, Yahoo has already invested a lot in this BABA spinoff and is far along in the process. Th ultimate idea is to keep the BABA and Yahoo! Japan stakes and dumping the core web properties. Such a spin would incur less taxes than a BABA spinoff. I still question what Starboard is doing at Yahoo. Cabela's, Elliott Associates target , has takeover interest. Bass Pro Shops is working with JPMorgan Chase & Co. to help it explore a bid for Cabela's. PE firms KKR & Co., Hellman & Friedman and TPG Capital may also be interested in bidding for Cabela's. It's now said to be getting interest in the $50 range from PE firms. Some investors have said they won't accept anything below $60 a share. In part, they believe the company still has plenty of growth potential. It has 77 stores in North America and says it has the potential to almost triple that to 225. Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Capital has upped its stake in Valeant Pharmaceuticals (NYSE: VRX ) from just under 6% yo 9.9%. This comes as shares of VRX are up 19% over the last week. He's now averaged his cost basis down, but it still looks like it's above $100 a share. Yahoo will jump if the CEO is fired . My take - We're probably a ways off from seeing a new CEO come in at Yahoo, and it isn't the sum-of-the-parts story that many build it up to be. United Online on sale . My take - United Online has a buyout offer from B. Riley, which wants a swift buyout process. The offer likely undervalues the company and it won't bite at the current price and wait for a higher bid or shop itself. Cannell Capital recently went activist here. AIG: Icahn heats up . My take - Lots to be excited about when it comes to Carl Icahn's recent threats over replacing the CEO and waging a proxy battle. The company is just too big to grow.
