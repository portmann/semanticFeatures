Apple's Next iPhone: A Bellwether For Growth Momentum - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple is about to introduce a new iPhone at an event probably on September 9. The expected features of the next iPhone will put it ahead of the best of its competition. On the strength of the new iPhone, Apple will post impressive y/y growth for the September quarter. Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) much rumored September special event is expected to introduce the successor to the iPhone 6. What Apple reveals at the event will tell investors much about Apple's future growth potential. Apple's next iPhone series, which will probably be called iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, will be better than its predecessors in almost every way, if rumors are to be believed. The key features of the new iPhone include iOS 9, Force Touch, a new Apple SOC, and a new camera. The most important new feature of iOS 9 is multitasking. As it was introduced at WWDC, it was only shown functioning on newer iPads with Apple's first or second generation 64 bit processors. After using multitasking for a while, I realized that there was really no reason why the iPhone 6 Plus could not also implement limited multitasking. Screen size and graphics processing are the limiting factors here, and the A8 processor in iPhone 6 should be able to support at least the most basic "Slide Over" capability. Slide Over provides quick access to another app, but doesn't allow both apps to be active at the same time. The screen real estate required is not great, so I expect that at least the iPhone 6 Plus would be capable of Slide Over. The new generation iPhone 6S will have even more powerful processors, so I believe that Apple will be able to implement full multitasking on the Plus size. This involves Split Screen view where two apps exist side by side and are fully and simultaneously interactive. With a 5.5 inch 1920x1080 pixel screen, there is more than enough real estate to support the functionality. In split screen landscape mode, the width of each half is slightly larger than the portrait mode width of the 5S screen. Probably the third key feature of iOS 9 multitasking, video picture in picture, will be implemented as well. Although I consider it probable that Apple will offer multitasking on the next iPhone, it's doubtful that it will retrofit it to the iPhone 6 Plus. My guess is that the 6 Plus will get slide over, but nothing else. iPhone multitasking would be a powerful discriminator going into the December quarter, since neither Android nor Windows Phone are likely to offer an equivalent. Although it's possible that Apple will hold off on iPhone multitasking in order to provide more of a boost for iPad, I consider it inevitable that multitasking will come to iPhone eventually. Another exclusive feature is Force Touch, first debuted on Apple Watch. Force Touch is more than being able to measure applied pressure, as it provides a tactile pulse that feels a lot like a button click. Apple is rapidly deploying variants of Force Touch throughout its product line. Force Touch is now available on MacBook as well as Watch, so it's logical to expect it to appear in Apple's flagship smartphones. Force Touch can provide tactile feedback for on screen buttons and controls, including text keyboards, so it should prove very useful for the iPhone. Essential to enabling the multitasking capabilities of iOS 9 will be the latest generation Apple custom system on chip (SOC), the A9. The A9 may represent almost as large a performance gain relative to the A8 as Apple's first generation 64 bit processor (A7) did compared to previous 32 bit SOCs. The key reason for this is that this will be Apple's first SOC fabricated on a 14-16 nm FinFET process, probably by Samsung at first. This will allow faster clock rates for the same power draw as the current generation A8. Also important, the smaller process node will allow the surface area of the chip to be reduced compared to the A8, assuming the same circuitry. The area shrink may not be quite the implied 50% = (14/20)^2. Actual layout area depends on details of design and implementation besides the process node. Past history indicates that Apple will put most of the newly available silicon real estate to good use with additional functionality. This added functionality could include adding additional CPU cores (the A8 has 2), or building in a more capable graphics processor (as in the A8X). My guess is that CPU core count for the base phone SOC will go from 2 to 3 (4 for the iPad "A9X" version), and the GPU will get beefed up as well to support full multitasking for the iP6S+. Another enhancement that will probably take up more SOC space is an improved image signal processor for the iP6S camera. The camera is rumored to get bumped up to 12 Mpix, with 4K capability. Such a camera would require greatly enhanced image processing, which the new A9 will be able to provide, as have previous generations. With all the improvements and exclusive features that Apple is building into the iPhone 6S, I don't think there's any question that Apple will be able to continue growing global market share, as I discussed recently . I consider this to be true even for China. As an aspirational brand for the new Chinese middle class, Apple is set somewhat above the turmoil in China's stock markets. If the Chinese economy does suffer a significant downturn, Chinese consumers will tend to put off buying new phones and simply keep using the phones they have. In this scenario, all price tiers will suffer roughly equivalent demand reduction. Last quarter, Apple was able to gain market share in China with 87% iPhone unit growth y/y , even as the overall smartphone market in China slowed to just 5% growth. There's some expectation in the investment community that Apple will not be able to maintain the growth momentum of the past year, due to foreign exchange headwinds and China. As with most negative expectations about Apple, these are just plausible enough to be impossible to rule out. Most of the time, these expectations overstate the case, as in SA contributor Gary Bourgeault's recent article . In it he states How the iPhone goes, so will go Apple. And how the iPhone does in China, so also will go Apple. There's no question that China is important to Apple, but as of the June quarter, Greater China, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, was only about 26.7% of Apple's total revenue. Even if year over year growth in China came to a crashing halt in the September quarter and literally flat lined from 2014 at $5.778 billion, Apple would probably still meet its minimum guidance for the September quarter of $49 billion in revenue. This would require a growth rate for the rest of the world (including the Americas but excluding China) of 19% year over year. With a new iPhone 6S/6S+ to offer, I think 19% y/y growth rate for the September quarter is very doable. My point here is that Apple has already baked in a dramatic slowdown to growth in China in the September guidance. As such it's very conservative, but it still represents 16% y/y growth at the low end of the range. Of course, this wouldn't be enough to satisfy Apple's critics, but I think it's likely that Apple will do much better. Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL.
