Learn more about PRO » IP traffic is expected to witness double-digit growth, thanks to the delivery of content over the internet. The market is placing too much trust in bubble stocks like Netflix for internet TV growth. Buy level 3 instead, which is exposed to the growth of IP and internet TV indirectly. Fixed costs, high bandwidth trend, internet TV competition and relative valuation is what makes LVLT a buy and Netflix a sell. Investing in internet content delivery players is one way to ride the IP traffic growth wave. We have seen shares of Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ), a leading internet streaming player, rise 184% during the last couple of years. The transition of video delivery towards internet is benefiting the said player. However, going forward, there are numerous uncertainties that make Netflix not a very intelligent investment. There are, though, other companies that can benefit from the growth of IP traffic and high bandwidth trend. One such company is Level 3 Communications, Inc. (NYSE: LVLT ). Following is our detailed take on why LVLT is better positioned than Netflix to capitalize on the growth prospects of IP traffic and internet delivery of digital content including video. Let's get a hold of LVLT's business first. It is a technology company that belongs to the industry of diversified communications. The company is basically a facility based provider that created its international communication network by constructing its own assets and through acquisitions. Level 3 provides communication services to enterprises, governments and carriers globally. The company provides data, security, video, voice and unified communications. It has an extensive fiber optics network globally that is used to provide scalable services to the clients. LVLT is a fortune 500 company that serves customers in more than 500 markets across 60 countries. Core network services, which made up around 94% of the company's revenue during Q1 2015, are as follows: IP & Data Services of the company include internet services, VPN service, content delivery network, or CDN, media delivery service, converged business network service and managed services. Competitors for these services include Verizon (NYSE: VZ ), AT&T (NYSE: T ) and Cogent (NASDAQ: CCOI ) etc. in North America. Level 3 generated ( pdf ) $2.53 billion from this segment during 2014 registering 19% y/y growth. Transport and Fiber services of the company include wavelength, private line, dark fiber and related professional services. Key competitors include AT&T, Verizon and CenturyLink (NYSE: CTL ). This segment contributed $2.09 billion towards the revenue of Level 3 during 2014 resulting in 8% year-over-year growth for the segment. Apart from these growing services, the company also provides colocation and datacenter services, and voice services for local and enterprise customers. Together these segments generated 23.2% of the revenue for Level 3 during 2014. Regarding the revenue model, the company charges on usage basis or charges a contractual amount. Contract based compensation is recognized on a straight line basis over the period of contract. As of year ended 2014, weighted average contract period was around 12 years (see the annual report). Usage based revenue allows LVLT to benefit from the growing need of increased bandwidth and IP traffic growth. Transformation of enterprises from legacy to efficient, scalable and secure technologies that can address the need for bandwidth and IP traffic growth will be the primary driver of LVLT's performance. The company pointed out in its recent annual report that enterprise bandwidth and content delivery were among the largest contributors for its top line growth. Anyhow, our buy thesis for LVLT is as follows: Level 3 is moving into enterprise and is less focused on wholesale. The company had 96% ( pdf ) enterprise customers as of first quarter ended 2015. 72% of the company's revenue came from enterprises during the same period. Enterprises are shifting to fiber in order to cater to consumers' bandwidth needs. Adoption of cloud computing is also helping LVLT's growth story. Enterprises are opting for off-premise cloud solution and, hence, requiring high bandwidth and high security private connections. All in all, the growth of data consumption, efficiency of networks and network security is driving the need for advanced network solutions. Level 3 will benefit from this trend as indicated by its high proportion of revenue from enterprise customers. Internet delivery of video content bodes well for Level 3. Internet is the prevailing mode of content distribution including software, audio and video. Level 3 gets to benefit from this as it operates an extensive proportion of global networks enabling this delivery. The company has an extensive fiber network that connects three continents. The company also owns 33,000 route miles ( pdf ) of undersea optical cables. LVLT's fiber network is in 350 markets covering 64,000 route miles. The company has an inherent cost advantage amid ownership of network assets. CDN and cloud connect solutions of the company look promising. Cloud connect is attractive for enterprises as it offers private and secure connection for enterprises to connect to web scale cloud service. One of the many reasons enterprises hesitate using an off-premise cloud solution is the security of the interconnection. Level 3's Cloud connect offers that to enterprises. Global Switch recently added LVLT's Cloud Connect to its portfolio. Overall, security will remain a high selling point for Cloud Connect. Regarding the company's content delivery network, video delivery over the internet is becoming main stream. Global coverage is a very strong selling point for Level 3's CDN. Despite low barriers to entry in the video streaming business, international expansion can be a problem. LVLT's content delivery network can be very attractive for streaming players requiring scale; LVLT's CDN gives broadcasters a larger reach. It can also result in cost efficiencies for broadcasters. Southern Cloud is relying on Level 3 to distribute streamed media services. Moreover, BWM recently entered into an agreement to use Level 3's CDN across its dealership network. Level 3 will witness integration related benefits from its recent tw telecom acquisition. $200 million EBITDA savings are expected from this acquisition. Additionally, the company also expects $40 million in capital expenditure savings. Further, the company expects to achieve 70% of EBITDA savings within 18 months of the closing. NPV of synergies is expected to be $2.2 billion that, alone, translates to a 10% increase in the stock price. The point is that revenue growth alongside cost savings will lead to substantial earnings growth during the next year or so. We believe earnings growth will be the number one catalyst for LVLT's stock appreciation in the near future. Not only this, tw telecom's acquisition tripled Level 3's network footprint within North America. Industry is witnessing growth, which is a positive for LVLT. IP traffic will grow threefold over the next five years. Metro traffic will surpass long haul traffic in 2015. Content delivery will carry half of the internet's traffic by 2019. Broadband speeds will double by 2019 and business traffic IP will grow at a CAGR of 20% between 2014 and 2019. All this is according to Cisco's recent forecast. Moreover, the video CDN market is expected to grow at 29% p.a. during 2013-2018. Level 3's extensive networks expose the company to the growing trends of the internet. With its vast optic network, LVLT is well positioned for broadband explosion, says Leslie P. Norton. According to Barron's financial newspaper, Level 3 Communications Inc. could rise 20% in the next year as it is well positioned to benefit from an expected tripling in broadband usage in the coming years. There are several other reasons to support LVLT's growth story among those mentioned above. The company recently increased its full year revenue and cash flow guidance. Average interest rates for the company are coming down; yearly GAAP interest outlook is revised to $660 million as compared to $680 million previously. The company has always been a leader in deploying new technologies including global MLPS, IPV6, VoIP and a converged IP solution. It also holds 1000 patents and patent application ranging from data and voice to content distribution. LVLT is a very decent bet to invest in the growth of the internet. Why, then are investors not seeing this? As a matter of fact, investors are somewhat appreciating LVLT's position. The stock trades at ~23 times forward earnings while the S&P stands at ~18. However, the market is not fully acknowledging LVLT's potential as it is still thought to be a legacy company relying on wholesale with execution problems. In reality, the company has beaten consensus despite currency headwinds. And, it's no longer a wholesale business. Its wholesale enable scale, which the company is using to serve enterprise customers mostly in the growing IP, data services, and transport and fiber services. Once the market fully understands that the benefits of content delivery over the internet can be more beneficial for Level 3 than they are for Netflix, the stock will take off. In fact, we believe, Level 3 is going to outperform Netflix in terms of stock price during the next few years. Both the companies are positively correlated to the growth of internet distribution of video but only Level 3 has the luxury of high barriers to entry and economies of scale. Let's analyze why LVLT will outperform NFLX over the next two or three years. Good news already baked-in for Netflix - growth stock, they say! For starters, Netflix already had a decent run in the past couple of years. Justified or not, the stock is up 184% since 2013. This could mean that positives like anticipated growth in subscribers and international expansion is already factored in by the market. Looking forward, the stock trades at astronomical levels. Forward P/E stands at 177. Bulls tout Netflix as a growth stock. Let's see how much of a growth stock Netflix is as compared to Level 3. Despite advocating Netflix with lofty price targets why is Wall Street reluctant to increase projected earnings? The answer is that Netflix is quite sensitive to a miss and even Wall Street is not sure about the earnings growth. And their uncertainty is justified. The company is adding subscribers, but it has to show earnings growth at some point in time, which is not possible in the near future at least. Why? Let's find out. The company has a subscription based model, which is good for retaining subscribers but the company is missing out on a very lucrative advertising market. From where do the giants of internet generate their revenue? And, Netflix doesn't plan to bring advertising to its platform anytime soon. The company supports a very high cost structure with a high variable proportion. Netflix has to pay for original content, interconnections and infrastructure improvement as the company expands. The company's trailing twelve-month operating margin is just 6.93%. And, it is not expected to get better. The company is expanding internationally, which entails additional costs. Regarding international expansion, Europe may be the last successful venture for Netflix. Emerging markets pose several challenges including low average disposable income, content relevance and piracy. There is literally no control over piracy and torrent based delivery in emerging markets. So, meaningful revenues from emerging markets are, for now, out of question. Then, there is competition. There are quite low barriers to entry, and large media houses are already offering streaming services. HBO, Hulu and Sling are just a few competitors. And, competition is intense; Daredevil is no Game of Thrones. Quality of HBO's original programming is quite higher than others. Sling is bundling channel streaming, which is a very compelling selling point. International markets' competitive dynamic is totally different. Local players are better positioned to offer relevant content to the public in those markets. Netflix has to deploy additional resources to offer more relevant programming, which entails more costs. To review, meaningful margin expansion for Netflix is not possible in the next few years amid high cost structure, variable nature of costs, high content costs, lack of advertising, competition and international challenges. To add to the problems of the company, the CEO promised meaningful margin expansion in 2017 and beyond. Based on the current scenario, it is not possible for Netflix to bring down the P/E multiple to a reasonable level with its current earnings growth estimates. And, when the company fails to deliver on its promise, the stock will tank. The market is mispricing Netflix as it is just focusing on subscriber growth while completely ignoring the costs of acquiring subscribers. Catalysts that will eventually hurt Netflix's stock include the rising interest rate environment, slowdown in subscriber growth, which is just around the corner, and earnings miss. Back to why LVLT is better than NFLX. As mentioned above, costs are mostly variable for Netflix. In contrast, Level 3 can benefit from economies of scale as it owns most of the assets it operates. Growth in IP traffic including video can positively impact the company's margins. Netflix has to pay interconnect fees and transit fees to network service providers. As transit and interconnect fees are priced per MB, they add no economies of scale for NFLX that can arise from more traffic. LVLT gets higher fees due to more traffic while Netflix's margins remain under check due to the variable nature of pricing. In conclusion, IP traffic growth helps LVLT's margin while having no positive effect on Netflix's margins. This is one of the reasons to own LVLT instead of Netflix in order to benefit from internet traffic growth. Demand for higher bandwidth is also not exactly good for Netflix. The company has to make capital investments in order to deliver 4K content etc. On the other hand, LVLT can benefit from high bandwidth demand as most of the company's infrastructure is already in place. Even if LVLT has to upgrade its network, it is charging a variable fee, which is correlated to the demand. Netflix's subscriber growth may not move in perfect correlation with bandwidth demand. So, LVLT is a better bet to capitalize on the demand of high bandwidth going forward. Increasing competition in the streaming business can hurt Netflix over the longer run. But for LVLT, the more the merrier. LVLT gets to charge transit fees or even provide CDN services to competing streaming players. Healthy growth prospects of video streaming and internet TV will attract more players, which will benefit LVLT but is not good for Netflix. All in all, competition in internet streaming can add to the top line of LVLT. In the above table, LVLT is assumed to grow at 25% p.a. while Netflix is expected to grow at 50% p.a. Note that analysts are expecting 48% earnings growth for LVLT and 23% growth for Netflix. Despite that, we choose a higher growth rate for Netflix and a lower rate for LVLT. The table depicts that Netflix will be trading at 32 times its earnings by 2020 if the stock maintains its current price. Now, the company's CEO says that meaningful profits are expected in 2017. As expansion is going to be complete by the end of 2017, it is improbable that the company will maintain a 30% growth rate beyond 2020 just by cost cutting methods in a high cost business. Not to mention, expansion into emerging markets will put pressure on the company's margin. Even if we choose a multiple of 20 for Netflix in 2020, the present value of its stock price comes around $270 indicating that the stock is priced at an extremely dangerous level. Regarding LVLT, a multiple of 15 gives a price target with more than 20% upside. Note that we used a 25% earnings growth assumption while analysts are expecting 48% p.a. growth during the next five years. Therefore, the upside would be much higher. Internet traffic is set to grow in the coming years, thanks to delivery of content over the internet and adoption of cloud. The market is putting a very high price on Netflix due to the company's exposure to internet TV growth. We believe that Level 3 is a better play than Netflix as it can benefit from the growth of overall IP traffic, not just internet TV. Competition in internet TV will benefit LVLT and hurt Netflix. Demand for bandwidth will benefit LVLT while increasing Netflix's capital investments. Rising interest rate environment is also not good for stocks with lofty prices like Netflix. Finally, all the traffic will benefit LVLT whether coming from HBO, Netflix or Sling. All in all, Level 3 will benefit from the positives of internet TV growth while avoiding the negatives like high costs of original content and competition. Therefore, if one wants to ride the internet TV bandwagon, an indirect play like Level 3 is worth considering. As for Netflix, there are too many problems ranging from disproportionate valuation, unclear visibility on margin expansion, competition and international challenges. In a nutshell, buy Level 3 dump Netflix.
