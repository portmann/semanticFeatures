Amazon's Headline Numbers Don't Begin To Tell The AWS Story - Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) | Seeking Alpha AMZN was profitable at +$0.17 per share for Q3 2015. This was a big improvement from the loss it suffered in the year ago quarter. AWS ("Amazon Web Services") was the real story of earnings. It saw a 78% rise in revenues and a 432% rise in profits. Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ) has a largely deserved reputation for being "the online marketplace." It earned this reputation many years ago, and since then it has been a Wall Street darling. It has been designated a "momentum" stock and its value has been run up beyond all reason. Its FPE is 113.34, and that number is highly questionable. It now trades at roughly a 10-fold premium to most of its retail peers. Does any stock deserve this kind of valuation? I would have argued that no stock does. However, Q3 2015 results from AWS ("Amazon Web Services") may finally present a justification for all of the previous years of hype. In Q3 2015, AWS reported $2.1B in revenue and $521 million in profit. That's a 78% rise in revenue and 432% rise in profit over last year. AWS accounted for about 8% of Amazon's total revenue of $25.4B in Q3 2015. AWS's $521 million in profit in Q3 2015 moved AMZN into the black for Q3 2015 with $79 million in profit ($0.17 per diluted share). By comparison AMZN lost -$437 million (-$0.95 per diluted share) in Q3 2014. In other words, AWS accounted for the swing from a sizable loss in Q3 2015 to a small gain in Q3 2015, and it only had $2.1B in revenues in Q3 2015. If AWS can keep growing revenues and profitability at the rate of Q3 2015, it will soon bring AMZN's P/E and FPE numbers into a reasonable range. If it could grow AWS profits by 432% year over year again, that would be an astounding $2.251B in profits in Q3 2016 from AWS. With 468.76 million shares outstanding, the AWS profit by itself would amount to $4.80 per share. That would drop the P/E based on extrapolated one quarter earnings to about 31. Wow! That almost sounds like a reasonable P/E. Of course, the Q3 2016 results suggested above may be wishful thinking. A doubling or tripling of AWS profits by Q3E 2016 is a more reasonable expectation. To be more specific, the table below from AMZN's 10-Q gives an excellent summary of Amazon's recent earnings and revenue information. As readers can see AWS is still a very small piece of the overall picture. Revenues and Income from International Sales were weak, as one might expect from the recent strength of the USD and the EU, Japanese, etc. QE programs. By comparison, North American Sales far outperformed International results. Yet on a percentage of revenues basis, they far underperformed the AWS results. This clearly makes AWS the "shining star" of Amazon, and investors should view it as such. What is AWS ("Amazon Web Services")? It is a constantly evolving cloud services platform provided by Amazon.com. These services include such things as Cloud Drive , Cloud Search, Dynamo Database ("alias DDB"), Elastic Compute Cloud, ElastiCache, Mechanical Turk, Red Shift, and Simple Storage Service ("alias S3"). Amazon bills for these services according to usage. The cost varies depending on which service is used. To minimize the impact of outages and to ensure robustness, AWS is diversified into geographical regions throughout the world. Each geographical region is further broken up into availability zones. Obviously, this system is more developed in the US. If you want a more thorough description, click on this link . It does appear that understanding this area of Amazon's business may be critical to evaluating AMZN's future success. For now, AWS is growing rapidly, and the ceiling seems unlimited. The chart of AMZN's Trailing Twelve-Month Operating Income below shows that AWS has been having a large impact in recent quarters. It also shows that AMZN has managed to turn around the rest of the business (at least the North American business). The chart of the Net Sales for the trailing twelve months shows steady (but less dramatic) growth too. Obviously, AWS at about 8% of revenues in Q3 2015 is not yet a huge part of revenues, so its impact on that growth has been muted thus far. Still at AWS's current rapid rate of growth, it stands to quickly become a big part of revenues. It is already a big part of profits. If AMZN can keep AWS growing at or near this rate for any appreciable length of time, it will soon have good to great P/E and FPE numbers. The AWS growth also gives AMZN's stock the potential to rise considerably. The average analysts' forecast is for +58.2% EPS Growth per annum for the next five years. Growth for FY2016 is slated at 190.3%. If one ballpark estimates AWS Operating Income at about $2B for FY2015, then a roughly tripling of that would yield about $6B in FY2016. Then estimate that the rest of the company roughly breaks even. With 468.76 million shares of Amazon stock outstanding, that yields a profit per share of roughly $12.80 per share for FY2016. That would equate to a P/E of 47.55 at the October 26, 2015 closing stock price of $608.61, and the FPE (for FY2017) would be about 30. Using the rule of thumb that the stock price leads to an FPE approximately equal to the growth rate (an average analysts' estimated 58.20% five-year annual growth rate), then AMZN could within a quarter (when FY2017 becomes the forward year for AMZN upon the Q4 2015 earnings report) see an FPE of about 30 assuming the October 26, 2015 stock price. This could logically lead to roughly a double in its stock price within six months. I don't know that it will, but the statistics for AWS tend to indicate that it should. It could possibly do even better. Of course, there is a big caveat. First, the world economy has been slowing. If the US economy slows or even goes into recession soon, that may mean losses for Amazon. It would be hard for AMZN's stock to rise at the rate suggested above, if it was losing money. Another problem may be that Amazon is finally becoming a "real" stock. Before it had seemed to rise on hype and momentum. With AWS it may have a "real" income generator. This could mean that its stock price could retreat to reflect a more normal relationship with its P/E and FPE. I am not saying this will happen, but investors should prepare themselves for this possibility. Also if anything happens to make AWS look bad (or less good), that could have a serious impact on the stock price. The chart below shows the recent North American and International Revenue Growth. They are nothing to get excited about. AMZN's stock price future now seemingly belongs to AWS. With all of the above in mind, one would normally call AMZN a BUY. With the increasingly negative world economic data, one would be more inclined to make a company that is primarily a retailer a HOLD. Given that AMZN is a momentum darling, I am inclined to make it a BUY at this time. However, if the world and US economic data worsen significantly, I might quickly change that to a HOLD or even a SELL. Still it is hard to ignore the potential for a stock price double within six months that the numbers seem to indicate. The chart shows a long and strong uptrend. Some might say AMZN's stock price looks over extended at the moment, but the recent news has been tremendous. That news, especially with regard to AWS, seems likely to get even better with the Q4 2015 earnings report. Then FY2017 will become the forward year (for FPE). Then the average investor will start to think that AMZN has some very real growth ahead. AMZN gets a BUY rating from me on the basis of its AWS growth that should lead to an FPE, when FY2017 becomes the forward year, of roughly 30 based on the closing stock price of $608.61 on October 26, 2015. The near 60% average analysts' forecast five-year growth rate per annum should then quickly ensure that the stock price roughly doubles to reflect an FPE of about 60 (equal to its long-term growth rate due mostly to AWS). AMZN is evolving from an e-retailer to a rapidly growing, highly profitable CLOUD PLAY. Investors need only to watch for seriously deteriorating economic conditions and for any trouble with AWS.
