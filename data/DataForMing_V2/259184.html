Why The $20 Intel Atom X5-Z8300 SoC Is Now More Attractive - Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) | Seeking Alpha As per the leaked 2016 Intel Tablet Application Processor Roadmap, 14nm Cherry Trail processors will remain the de facto x86 processors for tablet manufacturers. The $20 Atom X5-Z8300, not the Atom X3, is Intelâ€™s best hope to make its tablet business stop bleeding money. This is a follow-up to my article that previously discussed the importance of the Atom X5 Cherry Trail mobile processors. A recent leak confirmed that Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) will still be supplying 14nm Airmont Cherry Trail Atom processors to tablet manufacturers next year. Xiaomi and other OEMs are already using Airmont Cherry Trail Atom X5 processors for their Windows/Android tablets. Digitimes' chart below revealed Intel is not coming up with new tablet processor designs next year. The current Cherry Trail and Core m5/m7 family of processors will still be marketed as tablet processors for the whole of 2016. This is just in line with Intel's postponement of the 10nm processors to 2017. It's therefore welcome news that the $20 Atom X5-Z8300 is actually capable of supporting 4GB RAM max memory limit. The official datasheet of the 14nm 1.4GHz quad-core Intel Atom X5-Z8300 still lists its maximum memory size at 2GB. However, a U.S.-based vendor, O Plus, is already selling a 2-in-1 tablet /notebook product that has the Atom X5-Z8300 and 4GB of LPDDR3 RAM. Yes, the Chinese white-box tablet vendors will likely go for the entry-level Atom X3 for their sub-$200 tablets. On the other hand, I believe the bigger, established global OEMs will go for the 2-in-1 form factor and use the cheapest Atom X5. The Atom X3 processors are still limited to 2GB of RAM, which makes them less appropriate for higher-margin Windows 10 and Android OS 6.0 devices. The Atom X5-Z8300 will probably become the best-selling processor among the Atom X5 and Atom X7 family of tablet SoCs. The O Plus Notepad is a Windows 10 hybrid that looks a lot like Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) $599 Surface 3 . The Surface 3 has the $35 1.6 GHZ Atom X5-Z8700 and the O Plus clone uses the cheapest Atom X5 SoC, the $20 X5-Z8300. Both of them have 4GB of RAM but the O Plus Notepad retails for only P16,999 ($362) here in the Philippines. Just like smartphones and regular computers, Windows 10 and Android-powered device perform better when they have more RAM. Using the Intellipen with RAM-intensive Windows 10 software like Adobe's (NASDAQ: ADBE ) Illustrator CC is not optimized for Windows tablets/computers with only 2GB of RAM. My point is that many tablet manufacturers could use the cheapest Atom X5 to create high-quality tablet/notebook products and immediately save $15. Bigger OEMs like Lenovo ( OTCPK:LNVGY ) and Asustek ( OTC:ASUUY ) that thrive in thin-margin computers/tablets will really appreciate the $15 savings. The compatibility of the Atom X5 Z8300 with up to 4GB of RAM allows OEMs to create better multi-tasking Windows/Android tablets. It's a differentiating factor to have a 4GB RAM-equipped tablet now because there's still so few of them on the market today. The Cherry Trail Atom X5 Z8300 has better benchmark scores than the old Bay Trail Atom Z3735F. The better integrated Intel Gen8 GPU of the $20 Atom X5 definitely gives tablet vendors a real selling point - they could claim that their 2016 tablets/2-in-1 products are going to be better gaming machines. The Tronsmart Ara X5 benchmarked in the chart above is a Mini PC, not a tablet. The MeLE PCG01 with the old Atom Z3735F SoC is a PC Stick. The potential market of the $20 Atom Z8300 therefore also includes the growing mini PC market. Likewise, the 4GB compatibility of the cheapest Cherry Trail Atom SoC is a differentiating factor for manufacturers of mini computers and PC Sticks. Mini computers for the educational market and the enterprise needs the 4GB RAM configuration to make them decent all-day-long productivity tools. Of course, there is now a Cherry Trail-powered PC Stick with 8GB of RAM. However, the top-of-the-line, Atom Z8700-powered MagicStick Windows 10 PC Stick computer retails for $329 . The manufacturer of the MagicStick therefore used the Atom Z8300 to create a $139 version with only 2GB of RAM and the $20 Atom Z8300 SoC. I speculate that MagicStick will eventually release a $169-$189 model with 4GB of RAM and Atom Z8300. This scenario also applies to the future versions of the Tronsmart Ara X5. As of now the Tronsmart Ara X5 has only 2GB of RAM. Now that the Atom Z8300 it uses actually supports higher amount of max memory, I expect the manufacturer to also release a version with more 4GB of RAM. Linux, Android, Chrome OS and Windows 10 mini computers are all the same. They are very energy efficient but they still need the extra RAM to make them faster multi-tasking computers in the office environment. Meanwhile, Intel needs the PC Stick/mini PC market for its Atom X5 business to make up for any weakness in tablet sales. The 28nm Atom X3 is likely not competitive enough to match the price/performance of the entry-level ARM-based processors of Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) and MediaTek. Without the same 2014-level of discounts from Intel, I doubt if the Atom X3 will attract the support of stingy Chinese tablet manufacturers. I reiterate my Buy rating for INTC. Intel is not exactly advertising the 4GB compatibility of its cheapest Atom X5 SoC but I expect the Atom X5 Z8300 to become popular among vendors of higher-margin tablets, 2-in-1s, PC Sticks and mini PCs. It's the most-appropriate processor that might find OEM bulk buyers who won't demand exorbitant discounts from Intel. Unlike the Atom X3, the Atom X5 are targeted for mainstream $150-$400 products that allow manufacturers to make a decent margin. The Intel processor that could be sold to OEMs without subsidy is therefore important toward making Intel's mobile business a breakeven/profitable venture. The future of Intel in tablets and mini PCs is better off if it can permanently avoid competing with sub-$100 MediaTek-powered Android devices.
