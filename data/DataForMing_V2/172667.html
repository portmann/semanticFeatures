Apple: iPhone 6s Orders Are Likely To Be Tracking Below Last Year - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha There are several factors implying this year's order rate for the new iPhone 6s is running below last year's rate for the iPhone 6. However, due to higher production rates, when sales start they're still likely to exceed last year's, helping Q4 FY2015 "be safe". Come Q1 FY2016, though, things look dicey for Apple. After all, there's the real chance that demand for the new iPhones is not as high as it was last year. Given that Apple will have a very limited number of selling days during Q4 FY2015 plus the ability to sell in China (closer to the factories), it seems very likely that Apple will sell a massively higher number of iPhone units during those days. This makes for a potential Press Release touting numbers as much as twice (or more) last year's first weekend sales. This ought to be taken into account -- anyone thinking of selling Apple short would probably do better by doing it into the pop such a PR would probably create. The title nearly says it all. There are several reasons to believe the Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPhone 6s orders are tracking below last year's iPhone 6 launch, and indeed, even orders for the iPhone 6s, together with the iPhone 6s Plus, are also likely to be tracking below last year. This, in turn, means that Apple's Q1 FY2016 "new model" iPhone sales will end up tracking below the iPhone 6's. There are several reasons for me saying the iPhone 6s is tracking below the iPhone 6. Each one of them is rather circumstantial since Apple didn't come out and say it outright, but taken together they give us a high degree of certainty. Last year, Apple put out a Press Release claiming it had 4 million units pre-ordered within the first 24 hours. Since this is not about the first weekend (last year pre-orders started on Friday, this time they started on Saturday), it would always be possible to provide a 24-hour comparison. Apple didn't, even though it said pre-orders were very strong. Instead, this time media got to know about how pre-orders were strong and on track to surpass last year's first weekend sales through its spokeswoman, Trudy Muller. The first weekend sales metric is misleading. Last year, there were not enough iPhones to deliver throughout not just the first weekend but for a couple of months going forward. Hence, to beat last year's sales number, all it would take would be to produce more, even if Apple was sitting on fewer orders to begin with. Moreover, Apple knows it has fewer days to deliver the iPhone into Q4 FY2015 this year than it had last year for the same quarter, so it's very likely that it will deliver many more iPhones per day during the quarter, making a 2-day (weekend) comparison particularly misleading. Worse still, this year's launch includes China, which taken alone doubles the available market the company is selling into during the first weekend, as well as the pre-orders potential. That a Press Release couldn't be put out claiming first 24 hours hugely beating last year's is wildly amazing in light of this. Indeed, having China earlier in the process will favor Q4 FY2015 reported iPhone sales, but it will punish Q1 FY2016 reported iPhone sales, as sales are being brought forward by including China in the early release. This alone would be enough to already punish Q1 FY2016 numbers, but it's even more significant when the orders themselves seem to be running below last year's. It doesn't stop there. Last year, Apple claimed both the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus were exceeding its expectations. This year, it only said the iPhone 6s Plus was exceeding them. The iPhone 6s, however, is the higher volume item, so if it's not meeting expectations, that's likely to have a significant impact. Finally, it's telling that someone pre-ordering at this point can still get his iPhone 6s on launch day, which is consistent with orders having fallen below Apple's internally set expectations. All-in-all, these factors put together strongly suggest orders are running below 2014's iPhone 6's launch. It wouldn't be entirely surprising if such a thing happened, but while the market discounts low growth, it isn't yet discounting shrinkage. At the very least, orders look to be running lower than last year "ex-China". It isn't impossible that Apple decided not to publicize the orders statistic because of its utter lack of relevance given the doubling of the addressable market. But still, there is good reason to believe the iPhone 6s is tracking below Apple's expectations, simply because it wasn't highlighted to be tracking above them and retains availability in the Western nations. Also, the Q4 FY2015/Q1 FY2016 thesis remains valid even if China shows initial strength, given the shift in Chinese demand from Q1 last year to Q4 this year. Aside from the fact that last year the iPhone 6 had the luxury of significant pent-up demand for a larger-display iPhone, there's also another possible factor reducing this year's order rate. I am talking about the base iPhone 6s having just 16GB in storage. This is simply too low for an expensive flagship at this point in time and many customers know it, having filled up their previous 16GB phones. This will increase pressure to buy the next model up, the 64GB version, which is more expensive. Being more expensive alone is already a factor which can reduce demand. But worse still, for customers comparing subsidized prices, it's not merely "more expensive". It's a lot more expensive. The iPhone 6s 64GB is priced at a +50% markup (from $199 to $299) versus the 16GB version when comparing subsidized prices. So while (apparent) subsidies have long helped Apple move iPhones, this year they can be a problem for making the jump in price seem higher than it really is (in relative terms). It should also be said that a few features in the iPhone 6s will increase storage consumption. The higher-megapixel camera will need more space for each photo. And "live photos" (which I consider a gimmick) will eat up even more than a regular photo. However, I don't think the average consumer will consider either of these factors. It remains to be seen how Apple will account for iPhone sold through its new "rental" program. This is so both for orders and sales, and might be reducing apparent demand at this point (as someone waiting to rent the iPhone might not pre-order it). There's a caveat here. This year's "last year's" model is the iPhone 6. The iPhone 6 already carries the very attractive feature of having a larger display and now it's available at a lower price. It's likely that the iPhone 6 will significantly exceed the sales of what last year was the iPhone 5S. Taking into account that orders are likely to be running below the iPhone 6 cycle, but that iPhone sales were capacity-constrained for a long time, here's what I predict: Q4 FY2015 is relatively safe in terms of iPhone shipments because Apple will have produced more units for the launch period and it included China in the initial availability batch. So, by bringing demand forward, the quarter looks safer. Q1 FY2016, however, is likely to really undershoot expectations for two reasons: First, demand was brought forward to Q4 FY2015, namely in China sales; Second, orders for the new models look to be lower than last year's. With consensus revenue growth expectations already at just +2.3% year on year, there's the real risk that Apple might register declining revenues in Q1 FY2016. Apple faces the chance that the iPhone 6s cycle is not going to exceed the iPhone 6 cycle. If such happens, there will have to be further declines in estimates, even though the present estimates already discount very little in the way of growth. The fact that Q4 FY2015 still looks safe might mitigate the near-term risk somewhat. But if the launch is as "weak" as it seems (when compared to last year's), then it will quickly become evident that availability is tracking much higher than last year. This in turn will make it into all the brokerage research and end up creating negative sentiment around the stock, together with the lowering of earnings and revenue estimates. The stock would be punished in such a scenario. Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.
