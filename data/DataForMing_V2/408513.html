Instead of waiting until later this year to unveil the connected device, Google is apparently ready to pull back the curtain as soon as today. The New York Times, citing sources close to the matter, reports that Google is expected to introduce Google Home â€” or as it was known internally, Chirp â€” at the companyâ€™s annual developersâ€™ conference Wednesday. Google Home will reportedly function much like the Echo speaker â€” a virtual assistant will answer simple questions and complete basic tasks. A spokesperson for Google declined to comment on the device or its release; however, sources say it is expected to hit the market this fall. The device is said to resemble the tech giantâ€™s OnHub wireless router and would likely use the preferred command â€œOkay, Googleâ€? already in use in the companyâ€™s Android phones. In other voice-assistant news today, The Wall Street Journal reports that Amazon is working on an Alexa-powered tablet. Codenamed â€œKnightâ€? the tablet is expected to be Amazonâ€™s answer to Googleâ€™s tablet offerings. Unlike the e-commerce giantâ€™s current Fire tablet line, the new product will be solely focused around Alexa.
