How Apple Will Reduce Its Interest Expense By More Than 50% - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple is issuing $1.62 billion in a Japanese corporate bond offering. The cost of the debt is low in comparison to the United States by a full 100 basis points. When factoring in the potential impact from currency arbitrage, the cost of debt could fall by an additional 50%. The size of these foreign bond markets seems sufficient for Apple, so I don't anticipate the impact from a large scale corporate bond auction to distort markets too significantly. The $1.62 billion debt auction is a test run. A larger scale Japanese corporate bond offering will occur following the success of the first round of corporate bonds. Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) decision to raise capital from the Japanese debt market is indicative of the overlying environment in which investment banks are able to generate underwriting volume, as the implementation of CCAR is going to gradually diminish the size of the lending books for G-SIB banks. Of course there are winners and losers here, but in general the transition of lending to publicly traded securities indicates that Apple's capital needs will have to be served by publicly traded bonds notes vs. private commercial loans. Currently, Apple's credit risk is fairly minimal, as Moody's has an AA1 rating, whereas S&P has an AA+ rating. Apple generates $15 billion in annual revenue from its Japanese segment. The company's annual profit from Japan when applying the company's consolidated profit margin (21.6%) for the prior fiscal year was $3.25 billion. Therefore the company can technically pay the interest cost for a $100 billion bond auction with Japanese earnings alone. Apple's 2023 bonds payout a 2.94% yield, therefore, the cost of debt for a $100 billion float would be $1.94 billion at 1.94% after reducing the yield by 100 basis points. The corporate debt markets in Japan are roughly 100 basis points cheaper when compared to the United States, so if Apple wants to borrow a lot of money at a cheap price, I think it can. Based on the filing documents , the coupon rate, and the amount borrowed is better than the initial reports. The company raised $2 billion vs. the rumored $1.6 billion figure. Futher, the bonds have a five-year duration and a .35% coupon (extremely cheap). So, Apple's borrowing costs have dropped to near zero. The $1.62 billion auction doesn't materially impact shareholders by much, but it does give further indication as to where Apple will raise capital for future share buybacks. Morgan Stanley recently downgraded technology from overweight to market weight. I anticipate that the technology sector to lag against the performance of other sectors as asset managers will rotate into sectors with better valuation to risk metrics. I think of valuation to risk as a measure of implied volatility in comparison to standard valuation metrics like EV/EBITDA, P/E and P/FCF metrics. Therefore per unit of beta over forward P/E is one of many ways to measure the risk per given unit of value. From that context the shift to financials, energy and discretionary makes sense. I wouldn't ignore Morgan Stanley as they manage over $2 trillion in assets, and whatever they're telling their clients is what they're doing in their own managed portfolios. Apple still offers a better risk-to-reward in comparison to other large-scale blue chip tech stocks. However, Apple will need to be a "buyer of last resort here" as the company has too much cash sitting stagnantly on the balance sheet. The recent shift in portfolio allocations from technology to other sectors will weigh on Apple's future valuation. However, fair value is around $194, according to my own pricing model, and I believe Apple needs to employ a more aggressive share buyback strategy for the market value to catch up to the firm's fair value. Leveraging the balance sheet to reduce the effective tax rate is the most promising strategy from a capital return and tax strategy standpoint. So as long as Apple isn't over-leveraged, the long-term value from buying back shares at present levels seems the most practical use for cash. Carl Icahn's recent shareholder letter implies that the company needs to accelerate its share buyback program and look for new or better funding sources to go about accomplishing this. I anticipate Japan's 10-year government bond yields to stay below 0.5% for the foreseeable five years. Therefore, Apple has plenty of time to take advantage of currency arbitrage and low rates for a considerable number of years. Furthermore, corporate bond issuances are trending higher globally as indicated by the below chart by Goldman Sachs at the recent Deutsche Bank Global Financial Services conference. In the United States alone, the corporate bond market has grown 48% cumulative since 2008. The continuous growth in the corporate bond market should come as no surprise as liquidity and demand is starting to stabilize following the financial crisis. It's in my belief that the $4.4 trillion corporate bond market in the United States, paired with the 1.2 trillion Euro corporate bond market offers enough liquidity for Apple to float an even larger bond offering. Therefore, funding a large-scale share buyback through the issuance of corporate bonds is feasible (given the size of the corporate bond market). Based on the projections that I'm working with, Yen-based bonds are going to see some stabilization in terms of FX sensitivity. Regardless, Apple has significant pricing power in Japan and various other emerging markets, so if the currency were to weaken further, Apple can make up the difference by pricing products higher. That being the case, dollar strength will make it less expensive for Apple to re-appropriate foreign earnings via its various offshore entities to pay down the Japanese bonds as they become due. This is because the foreign tax havens that Apple uses stay in effect so as long as the earnings aren't brought back into the United States. Therefore, Apple can buy U.S. shares from a Japanese account using debt and use earnings from various European and Asian entities to pay down the principal balance from Japanese corporate bonds. The bond issue will primarily go toward share buybacks, according to the Wall Street Journal: In a preliminary prospectus released Monday, Apple said the proceeds for the bonds would be used for "general corporate purposes, including repurchases of our common stock and payment of dividends under our program to return capital to shareholders, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and repayment of debt." Therefore, the currency pair impacting Apple's effective FX exposure is the EUR/JPY. The Euro is strengthening in comparison to the Japanese Yen. This is good for Apple shareholders because Apple can pay down its Japanese bonds with more expensive currency. If this trend were to continue, I could imagine Apple diminishing the cost of its debt even further. Since Apple is borrowing at a .35% rate over the course of a 10-year period, the actual cost of interest could be substantially lowered by around 50% after factoring in the impact from currency arbitrage. If interest costs cumulatively account for 20% of the par value, and the par value of the debt were to decrease by 10% on a Euro denominated basis, the impact is a full 1/2 reduction in the cost of interest. It would probably take unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus to reverse deflation in Japan, and I'm borrowing from the comments that were shared by the executives over at Nomura when it comes to Japanese cyclicality. They believe in Abe's policy framework, but it will take unprecedented levels of inflation to drive consumption and a shift from savings to investment into publicly traded equities. So, not only would the Nikkei 225 need to outperform, it would need to continue a record pace of outperformance to drive the necessary shift from cash holdings to equity investments and small business investment. The good news is that Apple is repositioning its capital structure so it can borrow from Japan and can potentially repay with Euro-denominated earnings. Therefore, I anticipate that a large scale bond auction will be met with ample demand and a European and Japanese corporate bond auction will be the most optimal solution for reducing interest cost while maximizing shareholder returns. The amount of debt is small relative to the scale of Apple's balance sheet. Therefore, I believe Apple is running a test run with its $2 billion bond auction. Assuming Apple can leverage European earnings to pay down the bond principal balance, and currency arbitrage proves effective, Apple will continue to increase the scale of its corporate bond offerings in Japan, which will increase Apple's share buyback & dividends beyond the cumulative current authorization limit of $200 billion.
