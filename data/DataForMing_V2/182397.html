ETF Hub Sep 24 2015, 19:24 ET | About: Verizon Communications (VZ) | By: Jason Aycock , SA News Editor With wireless carriers fighting over new iPhone deals seemingly every few hours, Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) is responding to the scrum with Sprint and T-Mobile and now offering customers a program to upgrade their iPhone annually . So long as users have paid off at least half their device's cost and turn in their current device, they'll be eligible to upgrade each year without waiting for their contract to end. "If you’re not interested in upgrading, you still have the option to pay your phone off in 24 low monthly payments," Verizon says in its release, warning about "surprise balloon payments" with competitors. Earlier, T-Mobile (NYSE: TMUS ) introduced an iPhone lease plan as low as $5/month , and Sprint (NYSE: S ) responded with an all-night number crunch to create today's $1/month lease plan.
