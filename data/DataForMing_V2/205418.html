Apple: The 4-Inch iPhone Wild Card - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Apple is still producing the iPhone 5s. Spring 2016 could see the launch of a new phone. Timeline fits as iPhone 6s production slows. When Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) launched the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus last month, the company did not fully discontinue the 5s model. Yes, the 64GB storage model of the 5s was axed, along with the 8GB storage model of the 5c. Given the age of these phones, this might not be a surprise. But Apple has kept production of the 16GB and 32GB storage models of the 5s going. With the street expecting basically no unit sales growth for the iPhone in Apple's fiscal 2016 period, I believe the key to further growth is the launch of a new upgraded 4-inch phone. To first think about this scenario, we have to first look at the iPhone's overall timeline, which can be seen in the chart below. The 5s has lasted a lot longer than other phones launched at the same time, and it currently is going up against two larger screen iPhones that have sold extremely well. Based on Apple's history, it doesn't appear that the 5s will be on sale much longer. One might even wonder why Apple decided to keep selling the phone. A quick look at the iPhone's Wikipedia page shows how outdated the phone's specs are. The 5s only contains a 1.3 GHz processor, while the 6 line is at 1.4 GHz and the 6s line is at 1.8 GHz. The 6s line also has gone to 2 GB of memory, double what the 5s and 6 have. The newest phones also have several other upgrades in terms of Bluetooth, cellular capability, 3D Touch, etc. So why is Apple still selling a phone that can't compare with its current lineup? Well, the best reason seems to be size. Apple went to a larger screen size with the 6 line, and the 6s line has added features that make the 6s Plus more than 70% heavier than the 5s. Some consumers will argue that they don't need a phone that is larger than a US dollar bill. If you're putting your device in a pocket, it needs to fit in that pocket. Obviously, there is still a market for the 5s, or Apple would have discontinued more than just the 64GB version already. In my opinion, I think the company is waiting until early 2016 to eliminate the phone because that's when we'll start to see production and sales of the current models start to fall off a bit. At that point, Apple can have its suppliers start production on a new phone, let's call it the 6C, that contains a 4-inch display but has much better specs. If supplies of certain items are limited now, Apple would only want to include them in the more expensive phones. By the spring of 2016, these production roadblocks subside a bit, and Apple can go to a three phone lineup. This also allows the company to stagger its phone launches a bit, which probably can eliminate some supply issues and also reduces the seasonality of Apple's results. Because of its slightly larger size, the 6s line was basically a new form factor launch, and Apple probably wouldn't want to launch three new sized phones at the same time. But I believe the main reason why Apple would want to launch a smaller screen phone is because the company can target a slightly lower price point without going too cheap or crashing margins. For example, the company is about to make a big push into India, where Apple will have a few hundred square feet of dedicated retail space in six Croma outlets. These areas will have the same lighting, design and overall experience as other Apple stores globally. Many Apple bulls are looking toward India as the next great growth market for the iPhone, kinda like how they've viewed China in recent years. Recent reports have detailed weak pre-bookings for the 6s line in India, with the main culprit apparently being pricing. The base model goes for a few hundred US dollars more than its counterpart in the United States. This is where the 4-inch model phone would come in, as Apple looks to find a sweet spot in its next big market. According to Counterpoint, Apple sold 1.7 million iPhones in India during its fiscal 2015 period, up from 1.1 million in the prior period. That number is expected to soar in the coming years, hopefully getting into the tens of millions per year. Think about the math for a second. Even if this new phone averages say $200 less and represents about 10% of sales, the added unit sales volume could easily make this work. Would you rather have 255 million units sold at an average selling price of say $650, or 235 million (basically the current street estimate) at a $670 average? The higher unit sales figure brings in another $8 billion plus in revenues, which is a lot considering that analysts are only looking for $12 billion in fiscal 2016 revenue growth from Apple. The phone would still have pretty decent margins, meaning a sizable chunk of that added revenue would be profit. In the end, I think Apple could launch an upgraded 4-inch smartphone sometime in early 2016. There seems to be plenty of demand for a smaller screen phone because the company is still selling the much outdated 5s. A smaller phone could be priced attractively, especially if the company wants to target higher growth markets such as India. One of the street's biggest fears currently is that iPhone sales will flatten out in fiscal 2016, and a new phone launch sometime around March could easily knock that fear down. Just when sales of the newest phone are starting to turn down seasonally, Apple could kick up production of a tremendously upgraded 4-inch iPhone. Slowing growth has been the main concern over weakness in Apple shares recently. Hedge fund manager Doug Kass is short the stock , mainly citing the law of large numbers and the company's past success. With the iPhone 6 doing so well, quarterly comparisons are about to get really tough, with some analysts thinking the iPhone will show a unit sales decline in the December ending quarter. These worries have pushed short interest toward a yearly high. If good news from the company could get half of the 87 million shares short covered, it would be the roughly the equivalent of Apple's buyback for a quarter (about the $5 billion pace of purchases). As seen in the chart below, Apple shares are just below their 50-day moving average. If shares can get above this key technical level, I think it's possible that they head back to the 200-day.
