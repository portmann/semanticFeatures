Disney: A Stock I Am Buying Today Regardless Of The Market - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I am/we are long DIS. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. DIS has fallen double digits from its high. Star Wars became the top grossing domestic movie of all-time, in just 20 days, and hasn't even launched in China. DIS still has two more Star Wars films ahead, and countless additions to the Marvel universe. DIS's success in film feeds over to theme park, merchandise, content distribution, and all parts of the thriving company. In just 20 days, Star Wars has the No. 1 domestic box office haul ever. It has not even launched in China yet, the No. 2 market worldwide. The success of Star Wars is not only going to drive merchandise significantly higher this year, but also demand for the original films, and also in Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS ) theme parks. And to put the icing on the cake: Disney has another two Star Wars films lined up for future years, all of which are likely to be equally lucrative blockbusters. Let's look deeper into the media world: DIS also has the Marvel Universe, and a dominant kids production that pumps out at least one or two blockbusters each year. With the new Captain America movie later this year, and sequels to Star Wars, DIS is all set to dominate the top of best movies ever for the next five years to come, with several billion dollar movies from its top franchises over this span. As explained, this continued success feeds into a theme park business that gains pricing power every year, and maintains its popularity. It also gives the company leverage over media outlets that want to distribute its content, allowing DIS to charge partners whatever it wants. Last but not least, DIS has ESPN. While ESPN has had its fair share of problems, and likely overpaid for rights with the NBA ($1 billion), it is now a leaner company (job cuts) that continues to be the worldwide leader in sports. So yes, DIS had a speed bump with ESPN and subscriptions, but fact is that the NFL, NBA, and NCAA basketball and football continue to grow in popularity year-after-year, and that bodes well for the long-term direction of ESPN, and DIS. When you put all this together, it equals one of the strongest companies in the market. This is a company that has its hand in everything, movies, TV, theme parks, cruises, hotels, timeshares, toys, technology, distribution, etc., and turns everything it touches into gold. Yet, for some unexplained reason, DIS is about 20% off its high and trades at just 15 times cash flow. In other words, the market's volatility has handed us a gem! The Dow is off 5.3% over the last month, and since DIS is 43% more volatile than the market, its losses have been more than double that. Personally, I would not be shocked to see DIS go down further, maybe test the same $95 price it saw back in August. But given the success of Star Wars coupled with all the big films coming out later this year (and two more Star Wars films to come), I could easily see DIS making a fast break to $150! That would be another $80 billion in valuation, a price I would be more than willing to pay in exchange for two more Star Wars films and god knows how many more billion dollar Marvel films, along with all the merchandise and theme park profits that are created from this success. Therefore, I hope DIS falls 10% as the trading in China is once more suspended following a 7% collapse in the Shanghai Composite, because it means I will be getting DIS even cheaper! Quite frankly, I don't know how I missed this one.
