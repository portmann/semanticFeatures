Don't Expect A Galactic Bump For Disney's Stock Price Upon Star Wars' Release - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Previous Star Wars films hardly, if at all, affected the stock price. Disney's recent blockbusters did not move the needle for its stock price. Episode VII could break every box office record, but not do much for Disney's stock. Star Wars is one of the biggest film franchises of all time. The seventh film in the franchise is due to debut in December of this year. This will be a blockbuster, and the new owner of the franchise (Disney (NYSE: DIS )) is taking full advantage of its name recognition by expanding the universe. There are plans to debut an amusement park similar to that done for Harry Potter. Episode VII will be Disney's first Star Wars film and the first not directed by creator George Lucas. Disney has chosen director J.J. Abrams for the project. Abrams has been a box office success in directing a different longstanding science fiction franchise in Star Trek. This comparison is especially effective due to them being the same genre, and having a large built-in fan base. Disney has an i ncreased gross profit margin for the current fiscal year's fourth quarter compared to last year's. It has grown sales and net income faster than its competitors. Over the past few years, the company has maintained a solid stock price performance, enjoyed a pattern of growth in earnings per share, and good return on equity. Low profit margins are concerning, but DIS's strengths are very strong. Disney has 5 more Star Wars films planned. It plans to use the franchise to its full worth. DIS has made two successful acquisitions recently in Pixar and Star Wars. Already Pixar has begun paying off with the hit Inside Out. When the Star Wars theme park debuts, one should expect a large payoff. However, there is no timetable for completion. The closest comparison we have is the Harry Potter theme park. Theme parks have high operating costs and are subject to the economy, but when the economy is strong, it really pays off. Harry Potter's owner, NBCUniversal (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) (NASDAQ: CMCSK ), recorded $747 million in operating cash flow last year, a 5.6 percent increase. In a 2004 study, it was shown that the variables most responsible for the success or failure of stock price are the script, actors, director, advertising, production budget, competition, and genre. Episode VII is bringing back many of the important actors from the original trilogy, Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, and Peter Mayhew. It is also bringing in Academy Award nominated talent in Oscar Isaac, Andy Serkis, and Lupita Nyong'o. We've already touched on the success of director J.J. Abrams. The two trailers that have been released have broken records for the most watched within 24 hours. DIS is using a strategy similar to that of Abrams' "Super 8" in that, "the promos...are notable for what they tease, not what they give away (The Guardian)." The film will not have any direct competition in December as the other blockbuster being released is "Hateful Eight," an R-rated Quentin Tarantino film. The genre of science fiction has the highest grossing film of all time in its cap with Avatar, so the genre will not hinder anything. Star Wars, Star Trek, and Abrams' Box Office History As you can see in Figure 1, the biggest film was Episode I. This was the first Star Wars film released in 16 years, and the first of the prequels. It's fair to assume that Episode VII, the first Star Wars film in 10 years, will receive a "new show" bump. Despite being a sequel, this is the beginning of yet another trilogy. There is great anticipation for this film, for many reasons; Abrams' success being one, and the return to practical props rather than CGI being another. Another reason to expect a big box office number is to compare the Star Trek box office numbers. Abrams filmed the two most recent installments to the series. They have both more than double the next closest box office results numbers. The same jump should not necessarily be expected, as the previous Star Trek films were neither heavily marketed nor financed, but a major jump should be expected. Abrams' Star Trek films also received better critical acclaim than the previous Next Generation films. After Star Wars released its second teaser trailer, it started selling tickets for the release two months away. It shattered the previous record held by Hunger Games eight times over . These big box office numbers are promising, until you look at the stock prices of 20th Century Fox (NASDAQ: FOX ) (NASDAQ: FOXA ) slightly before and slightly after the release of the past three Star Wars films. There has not been a trend either way when reviewing. It's surprising to see how the box office numbers do not positively affect the stock price. We will examine Avengers: Age of Ultron, Inside Out, and Ant Man. Each film produced a slight gain in stock price after their release, but they could also be attributed to Disney's stock trend. The company's stock price has been gaining steadily over the past five years. Buy Disney stock. A big reason for the recent struggles in the stock is due to ESPN's membership drop. The three previous Star Wars installments did not make much impact on the parent company's stock price. Despite being the most anticipated film of the year, there are not many reasons to believe it will be all that different with Disney at the helm. Although, the lack of a big Star Wars bump does not take away from Disney being a good buy. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
