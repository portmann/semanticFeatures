Selling Apple To Avoid Stagnation And Boost Income - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha Aug. 16, 2015  8:17 PM ET  |  About: Apple Inc. (AAPL) , Includes: AIG , BBL , BNS , DRETF , GAIN , MIC , T by: Fast Track to Financial Independence My portfolio is mainly composed of dividend income positions, but I also maintain some valuation plays â€“ including, until recently, a full position in Apple. The valuation plays are intended to generate additional capital for new dividend stock purchases. I have reluctantly sold Apple, believing that a likely period of share price stagnation will frustrate its role in my portfolio for a considerable period. My hybrid dividend income portfolio is "hybrid" because although most positions are income-focused, I also maintain some valuation plays that I believe may generate substantial additional capital to feed new dividend stock purchases. The valuation plays included, until recently, a full position in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) common stock (6% of the portfolio). The problem with the valuation play positions is simple. While the dividend stocks obligingly generate income month after month, fulfilling the core objective of the portfolio, the valuation plays are simply a means to that end, and more importantly, they are a *deferred* means to that end. They only play their role when they substantially increase in value, making it possible to partially or wholly redeploy them to high-yield stocks, depending on whether the capital gain seems likely to ever be replicated. I view Apple as an exceptional case of innovation-driven returns, and, in a more short-to-medium-term perspective, as a cash-rich operation that is now ramping up returns to shareholders via buybacks and increased (but still minimal) dividends. I was hoping for significant capital gains in the short-to-medium term, but I increasingly became concerned that the pay-off could be too distant. As the following chart indicates, the market seems to have a love/hate relationship with Apple, and the share price does not much reflect fundamental value, since the focus for tech stock evaluation is on the future and whether the product pipeline can protect and expand current value. This means great vulnerability to investor speculation and mood swings. Looking at the chart, the Apple share price seems to flip between phases of strong undervaluation (today, 2012) and extreme undervaluation (2013, 2011). The relevant sector forward P/E ratios are currently 15.8 for the IT sector, and 13.2 for IT communications equipment, whereas the Apple forward P/E is currently 11.8. This, coupled with the extraordinary Apple earnings growth record, cash mountain, ecosystem moat, and analyst price targets, serves to underline the chronic undervaluation. I had been concerned that the cyclicality of the Apple share price, and its vulnerability to periodic investor panic over competition threats or single product dominance, could have locked me into a non-performing Apple valuation play for far too long. An extended period of stagnation does now seem likely, not so much because of competition or inadequate innovation, but because of unfavorable comparisons of future earnings, however good, to the recent stellar heights. For some time to come, even excellent EPS and sales numbers are likely to simply reinforce paranoia that peak performance is in the past and that Apple is too big to grow. This is a matter of psychology - the technical and commercial reality is yet to be written - but the share price impact is all too real. The sell decision was made reluctantly, since I do believe that Apple will continue to innovate and to grow its share price long term. In fact, while I am comfortable with my decision based on the information available today, even tomorrow Apple may reveal some stunning new technology that no-one could have imagined. That is a risk to be assumed. The timing of the sale could also have been better - I should have come to my decision and implemented it on the partial post-earnings rebound, but it did not crystallize until later. Some funds from the sale will be redeployed to help promote several high-yield names in the portfolio to full positions: Macquarie Infrastructure Company (NYSE: MIC ), with a 5.6% yield; Gladstone Investment Company (NASDAQ: GAIN ), a BDC with a monthly-pay 9.4% yield; and Dream Office REIT ( OTC:DRETF ), with a monthly-pay 10% yield. These three will join the existing, more conservative core holdings: Bank of Nova Scotia (NYSE: BNS ), AT&T (NYSE: T ), BHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL ), and AIG TARP warrants (NYSE: AIG ). The ramping up of the promoted positions will occur gradually to allow for dollar-cost averaging. Remaining funds from the Apple sale will expand my cash balance in case of a market correction. The end result of all these moves will be a higher portfolio yield (and risk), but also a larger cash balance poised to take advantage of any correction. I am more comfortable with this configuration, as I was increasingly uneasy over the foregone yield potential of the Apple funds and the receding prospect of capital gains in the short-to-medium term.
