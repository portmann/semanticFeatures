Disney: Starbucks Highlights Why Disney Has Firepower - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha So much concern has been raised about Disney's loss in ESPN subscribers. These fears are overshadowing some of the company's other big opportunities, like its theme park in Shanghai, set to open in roughly six weeks. Shares of Disney (NYSE: DIS ) may be up 12% over the past three months, but they are still down considerably from a 52-week high near $122. The fear of cord cutting, which began a cascading decline last August, still looms large. But there's no need to rehash all of that. It's not to say broadcasting isn't an important business for Disney. On the contrary, actually. But there're a lot of other things to like about Disney, specifically with its park in Shanghai. A few weeks ago, I took a closer look at what Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX ) was doing in China and why it may become the company's largest market . One tidbit stuck out to me, which came from CEO Howard Schultz in the most recent conference call , (bold emphasis added): On June 16, we will open in China what will, in all probability, become Starbucks' highest grossing retail store in the world virtually overnight. It is a stunning new Starbucks store at the main entrance of the new Shanghai Disneyland, a destination that may well become the number one tourist attraction in Asia. Not just Shanghai, not just China, but all of Asia. That's impressive. Last tidbit: Schultz also said he expects China's middle class of 300 million people - consider that's almost the entire population of the U.S. - will double to 600 million people over the next 10 years. While he expects that to give a nice boost to Starbucks' sales - I agree - I think it's a perfect recipe for Disney as well. Just like Starbucks, Disney will be a huge beneficiary of a swelling middle class, as more and more consumers flock to the magical land of Disney for family outings and vacations. Even if the middle class population count comes in below Schultz's expectations, it's still a massive group of consumers that Disney will be able to take advantage of. The Shanghai resort is scheduled to open June 16th. The attractions, entertainment, dining and shops will cover a whopping 963 acres - bigger than all the other parks owned by Disney, (unless you lump all of the parks in Disney World into one, but even then, it's not much bigger when it comes to the actual park sizes. The history behind Disney World's enormous size is actually pretty interesting .). By all accounts, Shanghai Disneyland is going to be massive, which bodes well for its potential occupancy levels. The thing I love most about the resort is how long-term the business is. There will be a short-term flood of tourists at first, but over time, it should be a consistent earner for Disney. The one concern investors could consider is Hong Kong Disneyland. Standing at just 68 acres, it's Disney's second smallest resort in the world. On the conference calls though, you'll hear management talk about its struggles with the resort. The park posted its first net loss in four years , as visitor totals declined and spending in the region took a hit. Attendance dropped 2.5% in 2015 - its first decline in more than a decade. Revenues, not surprisingly, also declined. Maybe consumers are holding off on visiting Hong Kong Disneyland with the Shanghai opening not all that far off. I mean, if you planned to visit the small park last summer, but knew a brand new, massive, state-of-the-art park was opening next year, might you postpone it? While Hong Kong may have its own issues, I think the Shanghai park will do much better. Even if there is a temporary economic slowdown in China, the country will largely continue to power forward. Disney's management has seldom given me a reason to distrust their judgment, and when in tandem with the likes of Starbucks' Howard Schultz and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), I have little reason to bet against the rise of the Chinese consumer. For all the hoopla being caused over the loss in ESPN subscribers - which Disney could be combating with its own over-the-top skinny bundle service via Hulu - there seems to be little focus on the company's soon-to-open resort in Shanghai and other catalysts, such as studio films or its quickly growing merchandise business.
