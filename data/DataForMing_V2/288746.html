On Ford's Strong Guidance And Its 6.7% Yield - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I am/we are long F. (More...)I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. Just two days ago I wondered aloud about Ford's operating margins in 2016. But a very bullish press release last night has alleviated those fears. Just a couple of days ago I published a piece on Ford (NYSE: F ) that laid out the case that the company's only real headwind heading into 2016 was the potential that discounting would crimp margins . Ford's sales momentum - and indeed, the entire industry - has been very strong in 2015 and with valuations at trough levels, it looked to me like Ford was in very good shape heading into this year. As it turns out, we received a lot of news from Ford last night so I'll update my position on Ford here in light of new information. Margins were my main worry heading into 2016 for Ford so I'll start there as I think that was the most important piece of the puzzle from last night's announcement. Ford forecast that 2016's revenue, operating margin and operating profits would all be about equal to or higher than 2015's comparable levels excluding special items. That is a huge positive for Ford as the company could have easily blamed any number of macro factors and issued weak guidance but it didn't; I saw Ford's margin guidance as very bullish indeed and it certainly gives me hope. The fact that Ford sees positive sales momentum continuing along with flat to higher margins removes what I consider to be the biggest overhang in 2016 for Ford and with the removal of uncertainty comes increased willingness among investors to put money to work. As Ford sees a brighter 2016 than 2015 despite the challenges the industry is facing, I have to think investors will be drawn to its ~6.5 times forward multiple. In addition, Ford announced not only its normal $0.15 quarterly dividend but a supplementary dividend of 25 cents payable at the same time. Barring any other supplementary dividends or outright raises in the quarterly payout, Ford shares will yield roughly 6.7% this year, a robust yield by any measure. This reflects the underlying strength in the business as well as Ford's ability to produce cash and liquidity from its operations. Ford has more money than it needs right now and the fact that it is willing to put it to work for shareholders means management is very bullish on Ford's future. Gone are the days where Ford hoarded any excess cash for a rainy day and that is bullish long term. While I love the new yield, it has become clear that Ford has no interest in a large scale buyback program. Ford just put an extra billion dollars to work with a higher dividend and while that is great, the company could meaningfully move EPS higher with a buyback of a couple billion dollars, easily financed with cash on hand or low cost debt. I must admit I'm somewhat disappointed that the supplementary dividend wasn't a share buyback but at any rate, the extra dividend is still nice. I was just hoping Ford would take the plunge and try to get investors excited about the stock by buying some of it back. Ford also released some details about its strategic direction in 2016, something that investors are certainly keeping a keen eye on in the wake of the successful F-Series launch, easily Ford's most important model. Ford said it would introduce another 12 products globally in 2016 including the popular F-Series Super Duty and that it would continue to focus on building electric-powered vehicles for the Ford and Lincoln lineups. Ford's long term bull thesis is predicated upon successful model launches and it achieved that in 2015 so I have no doubt 2016 will be successful as well. We won't see the growth numbers 2015 achieved simply because the major success of the F-Series launch is being anniversaried, so comparisons will be tough. But the focus on electric and hybrid vehicles is where the marketplace is going so Ford is certainly doing the right thing. In short, the fears I outlined about the potential for margin contraction just two days ago were alleviated last night with Ford's very bullish press release. Not only is 2016 shaping up to be as strong or stronger than 2015 but the company is putting excess cash to work in the form of a special dividend. In addition, Ford still has the door open for an outright raise in the quarterly dividend so be on the lookout for that later this year or early next year. I was disappointed that a buyback isn't in the cards but a 6.7% yield for 2016 is enough to make anyone happy so overall, I couldn't be more thrilled with the direction the company is taking in 2016. Ford's business remains strong and is apparently getting stronger and a yield like that certainly pays you to be patient. Any fears I had a few days ago have evaporated and now, I'm just excited for 2016. Tagged: Dividends & Income , Consumer Goods
