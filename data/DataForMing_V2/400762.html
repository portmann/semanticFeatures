Ford Is On A Roll - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford's U.S. vehicles sales in April climbed 4 percent Y/Y. Ford reported best-ever April SUV sales. Ford Motor's (NYSE: F ) April sales in the U.S. climbed 4 percent Y/Y on the back of continued strong demand for utilities and trucks, but I am afraid it will do little to move the needle in terms of investor sentiment. Ford has had a good run this year with first quarter results blowing through expectations. Ford more than doubled its profits Y/Y and crushed consensus sales estimates by a wide margin, both of which attest to the strength of the bull thesis. Ford Motor's robust financials are underpinned by high customer interest in (and demand for) SUVs and pickups, with the F-150 doing especially well. F-150 production, which has been a bottleneck last year, is now running on full capacity, so Ford is in a very strong position to keep F-150 sales growing throughout the remainder of the year. Turning to Ford Motor's April U.S. sales, shareholders yet again found few reasons to complain: Ford's total U.S. vehicle sales increased 4 percent Y/Y from 222,498 vehicles sold in April 2015 to 231,316 vehicles sold last month. While car sales again slipped 12 percent Y/Y to 63,285 vehicles, Ford Motor is doing a much better job on the utilities and truck front: Utility sales were up 7.7 percent Y/Y, and truck sales gained 14.8 percent Y/Y. Ford said that strong customer demand for the F-150 truck sent F-Series sales up 13 percent Y/Y. Ford's brand SUV sales? "Best-ever April sales," according to Ford's sales update. Ford Motor has seen a 7.3 percent sales bump year-to-date, largely thanks to U.S. consumers willing to upgrade. While the U.S. is doing well for Ford, and the company managed to book the highest April retail sales in the U.S. in a decade, the economic slowdown in China has hurt the company. Ford Motor sold 82,324 vehicles, marking an eleven percent Y/Y decrease. Fortunately, Ford depends much more on the U.S. than it does on China, so the slowdown should not be a threat to the company's 2016 guidance. Ford is on track to pull in a substantial amount of Free Cash Flow in 2016, and if auto sales remain as strong for the remainder of the year as they were in the first four months of 2016, Ford Motor may even opt to pay yet another special dividend to shareholders next year. Solid U.S. vehicle sales for the month of April were sort of expected given the recent strength of U.S. auto sales. Ford Motor is doing a good job in the U.S., riding on a wave of strong demand for SUVs and trucks. China's downturn has the potential to derail Ford's sales trajectory in the country over the short haul, but Ford depends, first and foremost, on the United States, where everything looks just fine. Ford Motor is on track to record results this year. Whether or not this translates into higher share prices is the big question. Since an investment in "F" yields 4.5 percent, and another special dividend next year is entirely within the realms of possibility, Ford remains a "Buy for income."
