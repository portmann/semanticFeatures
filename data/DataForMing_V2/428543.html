But there are bids of $5 billion or more for the core business, excluding any real estate or patent portfolio, according to people familiar with the situation. But the “core business” also doesn’t include Yahoo’s stakes in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan, a/k/a the parts of Yahoo that are actually worth money. According to CNBC, the one major bidder that low-balled Mayer was Verizon, making it less likely that she will have to report to her old nemesis Tim Armstrong . The report does not mention the bid from a group led by Bain Capital that includes former Yahoo CEO Ross Levinsohn, which isÂ the oneÂ we like best for its narrative qualities. Putting the players involved aside, the mere fact that Mayer could turn around and sell the dumpster fire that is Yahoo for more than $5 billion after rumors swirled that the business was worth between $2 billion and $4 billion is enough to make one believe that she is not in fact “Evita Breadsticks” butÂ the lovechild of Henry Kravis and Harry Houdini.
