Stocks discussed on the in-depth session of Jim Cramer's Mad Money Program, Tuesday, November 10. Cramer had a special show on Tuesday in honor of the US troops, to thank them for their service. "You need to have faith that things can be good for a long time or even get better than they are now. In other words, you have to bet on progress and on discouraging or middling days like this one," said Cramer. He added that no matter what the situation is, the Fed will raise rates at some point which will make some stocks risky and some worth owning. The four situations that will make the stocks worth owning are: US could get help from overseas markets like Europe and China. ECB will not be compelled to debase the euro against the dollar, and when China picks up, US could sell more exports. The country needs help from government. "If our leaders can simply do nothing without shutting down the government in the process, then that would be ideal for the stock market," said Cramer. Companies that can grow in a high rate environment such as banks, steady companies like Constellation Brands (NYSE: STZ ) and FANG stocks. "Take it from me, the pessimists will win a few portfolio battles, but the optimists will ultimately win the war," said Cramer. Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPhone demand An analyst report brought down the stock of Apple by 3% as it said that Apple has cut 10% of its component orders due to weak demand of iPhone 6s. "I'm always thrilled to see any research department doing real field work on any company, and this Credit Suisse (NYSE: CS ) report sure sounds authoritative in its suggestion that earnings estimates could be too high based on the firm's channel checks," said Cramer. This is not the first time that analysts have started judging Apple based on inventory checks, supplier reports etc. "In short, judging Apple based on these channel checks from its suppliers tends to be a mistake," said Cramer. He thinks that this report is hard to swallow since Apple's cellphone suppliers like Cirrus Logic (NASDAQ: CRUS ), Qorvo (NASDAQ: QRVO ) and Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ: SWKS ) say that the business is strong. To believe the negative report from Credit Suisse means something with the suppliers has gone wrong in the last 10 days since the company reported, which is not the case. Bottom line, Cramer reiterated that Apple should be invested in and not traded. "I say why not just hold Apple through this decline and recognize just how wrong this kind of trading call has been during one of the greatest multiyear stock rallies in history," he added. CEO interview - Polaris Industries (NYSE: PII ) What should a company that manufactures high-quality off-road vehicles like snowmobiles and motorcycles do with a longer summer till November? Is that the reason their stock is down 25% year-to-date, or does this represent an opportunity to buy a value stock? Cramer interviewed CEO Scott Wine to find out. "I feel like if we are going to get Polaris back on the right track it really has to do with entrepreneurism, and that is how we try to run Polaris. To try to create opportunities for everybody to make a difference in the company," said Wine. The company continues to innovate with new products and that is why their sales are up 12% in Q3. CEO interview - WhiteWave Foods (NYSE: WWAV ) In times of high interest rates, it's time to circle back to powerful secular growth trends that don't depend on the economy. One such company is WhiteWave Foods, that makes organic and and plant based non-dairy alternatives. The company reported a strong quarter by beating estimates and the stock jumped 5%. Any weakness in the stock should be a buying opportunity according to Cramer. He interviewed Chairman and CEO Gregg Engles to hear where the company is headed. Engles said that there is a powerful trend going on in the food business. Organic food and less processed food is what customers want and WhiteWave is at the center of it. "In terms of the total company, we are in the single digit territory in terms of our natural channel sales. So we are really a mainstream food company in terms of brands, and we run big brands that we market to consumers," he added. Cramer thinks WhiteWave is the best company in the organic space and they are different from Whole Foods (NASDAQ: WFM ). An interest rate hike could be on the horizon and hence Cramer went off the charts to take a technical view on the financials with the help of technician Tim Collins. The S&P financial ETF (NYSEARCA: XLF ) that has all the major banks in the index shows that although the group is strong, it can be at risk according to the daily charts. After Monday's sell off, the floor of support could break down. The RSI levels for financials has been at a high level but Collins thinks it could be close to breaking down. He mentioned that XLF could trade between $23.75-$25. "In short, the daily chart of the big Standard & Poor's financial ETF is not looking as hot as we might expect, given that I think the banks are about to become some of the sexiest stocks imaginable," said Cramer. The weekly chart however shows that the ETF could rally to $28 within 3 months which means that Collins expects this group to be strong in the long term. Cramer agreed with Collins' long-term forecast since a rate hike will give more earnings power to banks. Will the market support tech IPOs with high valuations? Cramer said only the best of breed will be accepted by the market. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ): Cramer said that although he likes the car, he cannot value this cult stock. What is the future of oil? Cramer said that oil will get higher only when the Saudis have to stop pumping oil. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ): Cramer thinks the stock is inexpensive. GoPro (NASDAQ: GPRO ): In their conference call, they talked about them not investing in their business and hence Cramer does not like the stock.
