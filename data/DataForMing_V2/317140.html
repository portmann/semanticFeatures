Cisco: A Dividend Stalwart In The Making? - Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) | Seeking Alpha The fundamentals support future dividend increases. Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO ) reported its FQ2 results after-hours on Wednesday, February 10, as Seeking Alpha has covered here . EPS and revenue both beat estimates slightly, but investors cheered the massive dividend increase and buyback. This article was written in 2014 after CSCO announced its dividend increase for that year. With the latest increase in mind, it is time to re-run the numbers. Let us get into the details. Cisco's new quarterly dividend of 26 cents per share gives it a current yield of 4.30%, even after the 8% increase in share price after-hours. This represents a massive dividend increase of about 12%. The company's yield now handsomely beats the yield of two other well-known old tech stocks: Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) with 3.58% and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) with 2.87%. At the time of the previous article, Cisco's yield was right between Intel's 3.70% and Microsoft's 3.0%. Let us look at the dividend coverage using three metrics: Payout ratio: Cisco's new dividend puts its trailing payout ratio at a comfortable 55%, which is more or less in line with Intel's 44% and Microsoft's 54%. Please note that these numbers are based on the current EPS reported on Yahoo Finance. Cash on hand: It is impossible to talk about CSCO as a potential investment without bringing its cash pile into picture. The company's cash and short-term equivalents make up about 51% of its market cap. Granted, cash on hand by itself does not reward investors unless it is properly used and that bulk of the $59 billion could be subject to repatriation tax. But it is still hard to ignore the glaring cash pile. Free cash flow: According to YCharts , Cisco's lowest quarterly free cash flow in the last five years was $2.06 billion. The current outstanding share count is about 5.07 billion. Multiplying the new current quarterly dividend of 26 cents by the number of shares outstanding, we arrive at the $1.31 billion the company has currently committed to shareholders. This is lower than the lowest quarterly free cash flow in five years. To summarize, dividends appear very safe. With the decision to add $15 billion to buybacks, Cisco can retire about 12% of its current shares outstanding. In the last five years, the company retired about 8% of its shares. As long as new shares aren't issued, buybacks have a positive impact on the stock price as EPS increases while also saving the dividend payments. Cisco began paying dividends in 2011, and the dividend has gone up more than 300% from 6 cents per share/qtr to 26 cents per share/qtr. The company is now slowly getting into the pattern that dividend growth investors tend to like: a dependable dividend increase around the same time each year. Cisco has announced its dividend increases in February the last three years. The table below shows the expected five-year yield on cost for an investor who buys Cisco at the current level, assuming it increases dividend by 7% per year. The five-year projected yield on cost is up significantly from 4.85% in the previous article to 6.01% here. This is due to Cisco's generous dividend increases the last two years, and this trend is likely to continue over the next few years at least. Source: Dividend and share price data from Yahoo Finance Earnings are expected to grow at 9% per year for the next five years. This appears a little optimistic, especially considering the fact that last five years showed an average earnings growth of 7% per year. If Cisco manages the same 7% earnings growth (organic, cost cutting, buybacks put together), the EPS would be around $2.63 in five years. If CSCO maintains the current payout ratio of 55%, investors are looking at an annual dividend of $1.44 in five years. This would represent a 40% increase from the current level. In the previous article, Cisco had a clear lead over Microsoft and Intel in three out of the five categories used below. Now, things are a lot closer than before, with CSCO still maintaining a slender lead overall. As good as these numbers look, investors should keep in mind that the stock has gone nowhere in the last two years. However, income investors can expect Cisco to keep them happy with at least a few more years of consistent dividend increases as backed up by the numbers above. The biggest problem we have with the company is that organic growth seems to have stopped a long time ago. These days, the company is looking only at acquisitions and is expected to announce more. These typically don't move the needle for a $100 billion giant. The new CEO, Chuck Robbins, has been in the job for about six months, and investors will hope that Cisco's stock does a Microsoft. Microsoft's stock took off a few months after Satya Nadella took over and broke highs it hadn't seen in years. While this is not a given each time, the idea here is that the market likes to cheer even a slightly different/innovative move from a new CEO. Especially if the old CEO is generally disliked, like John Chambers was. We believe Cisco is a good addition to a dividend growth portfolio, but investors should generally be wary of companies until they prove they will stick to the dividends and increase them through thick and thin. This is the main reason the dividend contenders and challengers are well respected as they've been through many hostile situations while rewarding investors throughout. But investors should generally be thankful that there are suddenly quite a few technology stocks with reliable dividends. IBM (NYSE: IBM ) used to be the only such name, but now we've got the likes of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Intel, Microsoft, and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) fighting for the investing public's attention.
