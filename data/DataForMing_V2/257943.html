Disney Still Represents Good Value In Spite Of Residual Concerns - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Disney stock has recovered most of the erosion in market value over the summer. The stock still represents good value at current levels. Disney still retains some high quality assets, and its moat is not broken. I am developing a passive income stream from dividends to generate financial independence. I'm proceeding down the path of steadily accumulating a set of high-quality, dividend-paying stocks. My strategy is quarterly accumulation of 30 stocks through a Motif Investment , with a few thousand dollars invested across all these stocks at a time. Disney (NYSE: DIS ) is one of the businesses in my dividend portfolio that I am accumulating. Disney stock has been under some pressure over the course of 2015, primarily as a result of concerns around sluggish revenues and that the steady erosion of the cable model would diminish Disney's affiliate fees paid by cable broadcasters. The stock, which was at one point down close to 25% during the summer, has largely recovered much of the lost gains. I believe that some latent value still exists in Disney stock. I started accumulating Disney in very small amounts in mid 2014 as part of my accumulation strategy. Most recently, I purchased the stock as part of my dividend accumulation portfolio in October 2015. I'm very interested in generating a sustainable long-term income stream, therefore I want solid dividend growth prospects. Disney offers a dividend yield of just under 1.6%. The company has seen a dividend growth rate of almost 15% annually over the last 25 years, according to longrundata.com. The stock has a long-term track record of delivering excellent returns for its investors. In fact, a $10,000 investment in DIS made in 1970 would be worth $2.5M today, This reflects a return over time of just under 13% annually. Disney's unique content franchises and customer loyalty creates a strong moat that competitors are unable to breach. Recent Results have been disappointing The last couple of earnings results from Disney have been a little disappointing, underperforming market expectations. In Q3 2015 revenues were up 5% year on year to $13.1B, particularly notable for the quarter was the relatively poor performance of ESPN, which was estimated to have lost some 3.2M subscribers over 2014 by Nielsen. In Q4, Disney had an earnings beat, but again missed expectations on revenue growth, in spite of revenue growth of 9%. Notable during the current quarter were layoffs and budget cuts at ESPN, an indication that Disney is " right sizing" the ESPN business for more muted near term revenue growth. What is lost in all of the recent noise that comes out in quarterly earnings releases is that the aspects that make up Disney's moat aren't broken. The key remains Disney's successful identification and development of a continuing stable of character franchises. These characters then get run through a virtuous cycle of consumer products, games and figurines, inclusion in theme parks and then their own debut on the big screen via studio entertainment. To get an idea of just how successful this model is, consider that Disney now owns more than 8 franchises with sales exceeding $1B. Mickey Mouse, Winnie the Pooh, Star Wars, Monsters, Spider-Man, Cars, Disney Jr. and the Princesses account for more than $1B each in sales volume. Each successful character franchise reinforces the success of the Disney moat. It means a new set of characters to take through the company's fixed cost production and marketing activities in game and figurine production and movie development. In addition to these character franchises, Disney's success is strongly influenced by the exclusive licenses to content and events that Disney has secured through its ESPN affiliate. These are things that are difficult to replicate without deep pockets to displace ESPN as the rights holder for these events. Alternate Distribution and Monetization is relevant The unique character franchises or the access to content that Disney licenses/ owns won't be replicated. Provided there is enduring interest in this unique content (and there is no indication that is waning), Disney's moat will remain in tact. However it is reasonable that the company looks to diversify its distribution strategy beyond traditional cable. To that end, Disney acquired Maker studios, which gives it access to an online property with a heavy millennial base that are difficult to reach through traditional cable. The company is also investing in companies like Jaunt, which is involved in Virtual Reality. Ostensibly, this may provide Disney with a new platform to bring its content stable to a new audience in a different way. Disney is making the needed investments to ensure it is not overly reliant on only cable, should cable distribution substantially wane over time. Disney is trading at a valuation that looks compelling. Disney currently trades at a P/E ratio of 23 and a forward P/E ratio of just over 20. Disney is trading slightly above average multiples over the last 5 years including price to earnings and price to sales. Morningstar rates Disney stock at 4 stars at present. Disney stock has risen since I first started my accumulation. My first couple of purchases in 2014 done at close to $90, my March 2015 purchase was done at $106.50. My purchase in June was done at $111 and most recent purchase was done at $114. Disney currently trades near $114. This is a great business that I intend to keep accumulating every quarter.
