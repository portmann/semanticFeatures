Microsoft: High Expectations For The Future - Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) | Seeking Alpha Microsoft's execution, strategy, and tone have changed for the better. MSFT has some great new products on the market. Years ago, I read some good advice, which suggested that investors should wait at least six months, if not longer, before buying stock in a turnaround story. The rationale is that it will take at least six months to determine if changes are starting to generate positive results or gaining any traction. You may have to pay a higher price for waiting, but it reduces the downside from the companies that are not making progress. By following this advice, I have been able to avoid many poor choices and at the same time taken advantage of some good opportunities that still had a long runway. With Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), I ended up waiting over a year before finally feeling comfortable enough to pull the trigger. Below are some of the reasons why I'm excited for Microsoft's future. Under Steve Ballmer's reign, Microsoft's execution was hit or miss. We tend to remember the misses, but there were some successes as well. However, since Satya Nadella took over as CEO in February 2014, the execution appears to have improved. Also, Mr. Ballmer was criticized for the company's strategy which Mr. Nadella has changed substantially. Another change is on its way as Microsoft is updating its financial reporting, again, to better "reflect the company's strategy and ambitions ." It will now have three reporting segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing. Up to this point, I have been very pleased with the moves that Mr. Nadella has made and believe the Board of Directors made the correct choice in hiring him. I don't expect everything that Microsoft does to be a success, but I do expect that future execution and strategy will be better than the past. The tone at MSFT has changed substantially, which has allowed the strategy to change. Microsoft is becoming much more open and willing to provide products and services across competitor platforms. This is an important change. Also, it is unusual for a company to not only willingly bring an activist on board, but to also encourage the activist to be a spokesman. However, that is exactly what Microsoft has done. If you haven't seen it already, here is a video with ValueAct Capital's Mason Morfit published on Microsoft's website. I am very excited about Office 365 and the subscription model. Currently, I am writing this article on Word 2007. Why? Because I am value minded (cheap) and had an old disk lying around which I used to download it free on my computer. That is the problem with the old model as a person can buy an Office product once, download it on their computer, and not have to pay again until the computer dies. With the new subscription model, you pay less up front, but pay more over time as each customer is charged subscription fees on a regular basis. Initially, this will reduce revenue and earnings, but over the long term, it should increase both. This creates a more stable revenue stream as well. At my last job, I used Office 365 and thought the product allowed me to be more efficient. With that argument, it may be worth getting rid of my free Office 2007 for the improved efficiency I was seeing with Office 365. Within days of Windows 10 being on the market, I was able to download it onto two computers. It is far superior to Windows 8.1 in my opinion. I have not had nearly as many issues with Windows 10 as Windows 8.1, and I like the look and feel of it. Also, I appreciate that it will be continuously updated. The strategy to allow free upgrades for all Windows 7, Windows 8.1, and Windows Phone 8.1 was a great move. Already 110 million users have switched to Windows 10, which means it is about 11% of the way to its goal. In the near term, the free upgrade strategy will reduce revenues but will increase usage. Along with Windows 10, I downloaded the new Edge browser. It is an upgrade from Internet Explorer and has some cool features, but there are some websites that I still have issues with when using Edge. That being said, over time, I expect these issues to be resolved. Windows 10 and Edge provide more evidence of Microsoft's improving execution and strategy. MSFT still needs to improve its execution on many of its hardware products, but the new Surface Book is a good start. As Wired stated "Microsoft's Surface Book is the most exciting Windows laptop in years." If I wasn't so value-oriented, I would probably think about buying one myself, but it's a little too pricey ($1,499-2,699 ) for me. The ability to detach the screen and the flexible hinge are useful but performance is key. " Microsoft claims its the fastest laptop of its size ever made." This shows that the company may be able to put out products that really excite people. It also may encourage other computer OEMs to improve their designs, which should benefit Microsoft as well. The Surface tablets also appear to be good products and HoloLens has some potential and interesting capabilities. We will see if Microsoft can continue to push ahead and make more "cool" devices. Compared to the prior-year quarter, Dynamics revenue grew 15% in constant currency and Dynamics CRM's online base grew by almost 2.5x in Q4 2015. Furthermore, commercial cloud revenue was up 96% in constant currency. This bodes very well for the new Productivity and Business Processes segment, which includes Office, Office 365, Dynamics, and Dynamics Online. Also, last quarter server products and services grew at 9% in constant currency, which is a good sign for the Intelligent Cloud segment. Search revenue grew 21% with Bing increasing market share by 1.1% to 20.3%. Combine this with the new Surface Book and maybe it can offset a little bit of the decline in Windows OEM. Microsoft has a bright future ahead in my opinion. I expect better execution, strategy, and products. The subscription service should add value, and there is strong growth in many areas of the company. We only use your contact details to reply to your request for more information.
