Disney's Licensing Deal With Kabam Is A Template For Success - The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) | Seeking Alpha Marvel Contest of Champions is Kabam’s fastest mobile game to achieve $100 million in gross revenue. Kabam is expanding its licensing deal with Disney to include Star Wars assets. Disney is still the world’s No. 1 global brand licensor for retail physical goods. Disney has another future gold mine in licensing virtual goods. Disney's (NYSE: DIS ) licensing deal with hit mobile game developer Kabam last year is a template for success in further monetizing Marvel and Star Wars assets. The mobile game Marvel Contest of Champions (released last December) is Kabam's fastest title to achieve $100 million in gross revenue. Marvel Contest of Champions grossed more than $100 million in just seven months. Kabam's previous fastest-grossing mobile game was The Hobbit: Kingdoms of Middle Earth , which took 13 months to achieve $100 million. An inspiring infographic published by Kabam reveals Marvel Contest of Champions touts 40 million downloads since its December 2014 release. The United States, Brazil and Russian Federation have the highest number of active players. The success of Marvel Contest of Champions in the U.S. is an easy explanation why Kabam's game quickly achieved the $100 million revenue milestone. As per the estimates of ThinkGaming , this Disney-licensed game is helping Kabam enjoy an average daily sales of $320k from iPhone gamers in the United States. Take note that Contest of Champions is just the No.44 most-downloaded game, and yet it is the No.6 Top Grossing iPhone game in the U.S. It is to the great benefit of Disney that Marvel Contest of Champions boasts a very high Average Revenue Per Daily Active User (ARPDAU). This Marvel mobile game has an estimated average daily active users (U.S. iPhone gamers only) of 1,364,193. The estimated ARPDAU of Contest of Champions is $ 0.29, which is near the monetization level of Clash of Clans (estimated ARPDAU is $0.38). Kabam, which made $400 million in revenue last year, intends to make $1 billion in annual revenue from mobile games. Kabam's highly profitable run since 2011 is due to its proficiency in coming up with addictive/competitive Pay-to-Win freemium mobile games. Contest of Champions has players willing to spend $100 for just one 4-star Marvel Superhero. Kabam's official $100 million sales announcement states a monthly sales of $14.29 million. However, Contest of Champions is still a growing cash cow for Disney and Kabam. The release of a native version for the China market could improve the revenue stream from Contest of Champions. Kabam has tapped the help of Longtu Games to bring Contest of Champions in China's lucrative mobile games market. Longtu Games is the third-biggest grossing game publisher in China - just behind Tencent ( OTCPK:TCEHY ) and Clash of Clans-maker Supercell. There is a ready market for $100 or $20 Contest of Champions superheroes in China. Like Kabam, Longtu Games' success is also thanks to Pay-To-Win mobile games. Longtu's Dot Arena is a heroes-themed title and it is China's top grossing iOS game. Common sense says Contest of Champions' proven Pay-To-Win formula will find favor among big-spending players of Longtu. A $20 Three-Star premium hero like the Iron Man below is also easily affordable to any Chinese iPhone 6 gamer. China has recently delivered more iPhone sales than the U.S. this year. The Chinese people also helped Disney's The Avengers: Age of Ultron movie breached the $1.4 Billion ticket sales milestone. The mainstream appeal of Marvel superheroes in China tells me that Contest of Champions could match the $312k/ day average sales of U.S. iPhone players. Kabam's impressive success with Contest of Champions is likely why Disney again picked it to develop a Star Wars Role-Playing Game (NYSEARCA: RPG ) for mobile devices. Disney can collect more licensing fees from every premium item or Star Wars hero that Kabam will soon sell to its customers. Kabam has already softlaunched the iOS version of Star Wars: Uprising in select countries. New Zealand residents can now download and play Star Wars: Uprising. The Android version is also available in some countries like the Philippines. Like Marvel Contest of Champions, only players who spend the most amount of dollars will dominate in the leader rankings in Star Wars: Uprising. The cooperative Player-Vs-Player combat feature in Star Wars: Uprising will inevitably force many players to constantly purchase premium in-game items and weapons. The sell-off last week is creating an opportunity to buy Disney at cheaper price levels. Disney remains the top beneficiary of global sales of licensed retail goods. While movies like the Ant Man film may fail to achieve the ticket sales of Age of Ultron, licensing Disney properties could make up for weaker box office revenue. There is an evident multi-billion opportunity in licensing Disney-owned characters like Iron Man to game developers. Unlike a Marvel Avengers or Mickey Mouse T-shirt, a virtual weapon/hero (for sale to mobile gamers) can be produced infinitely and delivered instantly with essentially zero manufacturing cost. Virtual goods are also free from the specter of the unsold inventory woes of physical goods. The pay-to-win freemium formula of Kabam is a perfect template for other licensing deals. I look forward to more mobile games featuring Marvel and Star Wars characters made by Kabam and other leading developers. Glu Mobile (NASDAQ: GLUU ) is an obvious candidate for Disney's licensing program. Zynga (NASDAQ: ZNGA ) might also benefit from a Marvel-licensed game. The strong virtual goods sales of Kabam's Contest of Champions and NetMarble's Marvel Future Fight should inspire money-losing Glue and Zynga to bet on Disney characters.
