Ford Sales Dip In March - Company Focus On Retail Sales Could Keep Stock Lifted - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Ford sold 235,929 vehicles in March of 2015. Ford (NYSE: F ) did not have the best headlines with regard to march auto sales, but the company did sell 235,000 vehicles and saw its retail sales climb. Overall the auto sector remains on a pace to sell 17 million cars this year. Last year overall sector sales were 16.5 million. Thus, growth of 500,000 cars spread over several manufacturers will mean leaner raw growth numbers this year despite sales levels approaching record highs. A particular bright spot in the Ford franchise is the Lincoln line. Lincoln is seeing fresher looks, gaining appeal with younger drivers, and seeing sales increase at a decent clip. Lincoln sales were up 7%. Ford has also reinvented the perception of full size work vans and put marketing muscle behind its Transit line of vehicles. transit sales should be a nice growth segment for the auto maker. Sales of Transit vans rose 42% and March of 2015 represented the most robust van sales in 21 years. Ford stock has ranged between about $14.50 and $16.50 in 2015. Currently the stock trades at just under $16. Some of the strategies Ford is considering in 2015 have potential to help build new brand loyalty, help the brand increase in resale value, and help the bottom line. These moves could allow Ford stock to appreciate and perhaps challenge the 52 week high in the $18 range. The equity is not without a bit of risk though. Ford is getting ready to renegotiate its labor rates with unions representing hourly workers. Ford's America's Chief, Joe Hinrichs, announced at an investor conference that a goal of the company is to bring Fords labor costs more in line with that of Fiat Chrysler. Among the top priorities in these negotiations is to negotiate more competitive rates for entry level works. It is estimated that Ford's average pay including benefits is $57 per hour, while Fiat Chrysler is much lower and at $48 per hour. If Ford can successfully cut the cost side of the business it could help the bottom line in a material way. If Ford is not successful, the talks could drag out and cause disruption in the usual flow of business, projections, etc. The concentration on retail instead of fleet sales is an interesting dynamic. Fleet sales pump up volume, but can also dilute the resale value of cars in a brand. Resale value is a consideration of many consumers. Consumers want a combination of value when they buy, and value in return when they sell or trade. By increasing the ratio toward retail buyers, Ford is, in a longer term, protecting the value of the Ford brand. This dynamic, over time, can build consumer loyalty. Ford is also making "sexier" cars that carry more consumer appeal. This is another dynamic that will increase brand loyalty, sales, and eventually market share. The new Lincoln line-up, which carries more curb appeal to more people, is an example of expanding specific models, and even a specific make to a larger demographic of people. Ford also shows an ability to fill a niche and grow new markets with the Ford Transit line. These vans are more customizable than the traditional vans, and are marketed very well. The Ford Transit is a niche market, but sometimes these types of markets can present the best margins. On the bullish side we have a sexier brand, efforts to increase value at the initial purchase, efforts to increase the consumer value at trade in, and a possible cut in labor costs with a union negotiation this summer. On the bearish side we have the fact that growth does not look as good in terms of percentages than we have seen in recent years, and a the possibility of labor negotiations being dragged out without the concessions Ford is seeking. Personally I see Ford as a buy at these levels. In February of this year, with Ford at $14.71 I stated that I felt Ford had a chance at seeing a good first half of 2015. The equity has already seen a gain of 8% since that time, and in my opinion will remain bullish going into the Summer. Ford may not be the biggest, but the company has many strengths that make it a pretty safe play in the auto sector. Stay Tuned!
