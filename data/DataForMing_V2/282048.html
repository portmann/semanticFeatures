Can Ford Make A Comeback This Year? - Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) | Seeking Alpha Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Ford struggled on the stock market last year as weakness in China overshadowed the positives in the U.S., but 2016 will turn out to be different. Low unemployment rates and faster wage growth in 2016 will power U.S. auto sales to more than 18 million units, driven by the growth in SUVs and pick-up trucks. China will see stronger auto growth of 5%-7% this year due to lower sales tax and the growing adoption of EVs. Since Ford is strengthening its SUV and pick-up truck line-up in the U.S. and has also finished introducing 15 new models in China, it can benefit from both markets. Fordâ€™s focus on the EV market on the back of a $4.5 billion investment will reap rewards in markets such as China in the long run. The recently concluded 2015 was a mixed bag for the global automobile industry as the optimism was muted due to weakness in China, the world's largest auto market. On the other hand, auto sales in the U.S. remained strong in 2015 with sales of 17.5 million vehicles , an increase from 16.4 million vehicles last year. In the midst of these mixed emotions in two of the most important auto markets across the globe, Ford (NYSE: F ) turned in a muted performance on the stock market in 2015, losing almost 9% of its value. Ford's decline started after weakness in the Chinese auto market reared its head, bringing an end to the bright start that Ford had in 2015. However, investors should not miss the fact that Ford has started gaining some momentum in the past three months, and I won't be surprised if this trend continues for the rest of the year. So, in this post, we will take a closer look at how the auto markets of the U.S. and China are expected to perform, and how they will shape Ford's performance this year. In fact, this year, it is expected that U.S. auto sales will cross the 18-million-mark. The improvement in the auto market will be driven by better economic conditions in the U.S., such as an improvement in employment and better wage growth. For instance, as shown in the table given below, the unemployment rate in the U.S. has declined steadily over the past few years. In fact, in 2015, the unemployment rate has come down to 5%, indicating full employment: At the same time, it is anticipated that in 2016, we will see an increase in wage growth. As reported by Bloomberg : "After five years in which annual wage increases have averaged around 2 percent, salaries are set to pick up as a taut job market prompts more employers to boost pay to retain or add the workers they need, economists said. "This will be the first time in a long time -- and I'm talking a long time -- that workers will see real wage inflation of some magnitude," said Jonas Prising, chief executive officer of ManpowerGroup Inc., the Milwaukee-based staffing company with more than $20 billion in revenue last year." In fact, for much of 2015, wage growth in the U.S. remained strong, as shown below, and it is anticipated that this trend will also continue in the New Year. Hence, a combination of higher employment and higher wages will push up the purchasing power of consumers, and this bodes well for automakers such as Ford. However, the U.S. is not the only market of importance for Ford as the company is on track to hit a million units in sales in China for 2015. But, the economic conditions in China are not as favorable as the U.S. Sales of new vehicles slowed down in China in 2015 after several years of strong growth. As such, this market has to stop collapsing if Ford is to do well in 2016 as the company now gets a sizable portion of its sales from here. But, the good thing is that Ford's sales in China are now picking up pace. Ford's sales in China for November increased 9% from last year and it is likely that the company will be able to sustain this momentum in the New Year. In fact, Ford will benefit from a drop in sales tax on new vehicles, which is expected to drive the Chinese auto market's growth to a range of 5%-7% in 2016 as compared to 3% last year. Now, considering that Ford has bolstered its product portfolio in China by introducing 15 new vehicles, it is now in a strong position to benefit from the growth in this market. Ford is focusing on key hotspots in both the U.S. and China, which is a smart move in my opinion. For instance, in the U.S., Ford has strengthened its pick-up truck and SUV segment with the launch of the new F-150 and Edge models. On the back of such models, Ford can benefit from the booming SUV and truck market in the U.S. In fact, pick-up trucks account for 13% of auto sales in the U.S., while SUVs account for 33%. Looking ahead, it is expected that by 2020, SUV sales will account for 40% of the market. Thus, Ford is moving in the right direction in the U.S. by focusing on light trucks and SUVs. Meanwhile, in China, Ford will benefit from the increasing demand for electric vehicles as it has lined up an investment of $4.5 billion in electrified vehicle solutions for the next five years. In the next half decade, the company will introduce 13 new electric and hybrid vehicles, which will allow it to tap the booming EV market in China. Thus, considering the prospects of the Chinese and U.S. auto markets, we can expect that Ford will have a better time in 2016. The company will benefit from positive actions by the government in China, while improving employment conditions in the U.S. will be another tailwind. So, in my opinion, after a disappointing 2015, Ford is all set to make a comeback this year. Tagged: Investing Ideas , Consumer Goods
