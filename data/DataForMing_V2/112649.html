Verizon And AOL: A Good Match? - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha Verizon's acquisition of AOL has made it a key player in the digital media services segment of the industry. This acquisition allows the company to keep pace with the competition. Digital media. video streaming, and mobile ads are the main growth areas in the industry, and this acquisition should allow Verizon to take advantage of this growth potential. Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) completed the acquisition of AOL just over two weeks ago. There has not been much coverage of this event on herwne and I believe it deserves a deeper analysis. This deal is extremely important for the company and it will result in adding a lucrative business segment to the company. AOL had a major transformation from an internet service providing company to one of the most successful advertising technology companies in the U.S. AOL has a lot of competitive strengths. It has recently invested in advertising technology, purchased adaptive TV in 2013 - a platform for buyers and sellers of online video advertising. AOL shareholders have more than doubled their investment value (150%) during the last five years, and now Verizon shareholders will also enjoy this growth as AOL's core business is still in the early stages of growth. The future of the advertising is with the mobile devices. AOL has the best-in-class advertisement platforms which can be matched with the largest wireless customer base of Verizon. Both these companies can work on personalized ads as Verizon has a massive database. AOL has been growing its digital advertisement business without Verizon at an impressive rate. However, the combination of Verizon's customer base and AOL's digital ads will result in a substantial increase in revenues as well as cash flows for the company. The shape of the management chain also indicates how Verizon wants to take this business forward. This acquisition has made AOL a subsidiary of Verizon and the company has decided to keep AOL's CEO, Tim Armstrong, in his position. Also, Verizon's president of digital media services, Bob Toohey, will now report to Tim Armstrong. Verizon's digital media services is the business that will have the highest amount of synergies with AOL's business. So, the company has recognized AOL's strengths and shifted its own business under the supervision of AOL as well. In my opinion, this is a wise move as AOL has been extremely successful in the digital media services area and their management looks better prepared to take this segment forward. AOL has 2 million subscribers and its platforms attract 200 million unique visitors per month - this is a massive number and it will give considerable exposure to the advertisers. Therefore, businesses will be vying for these advertising slots when Verizon is able to combine these subscribers to its own vast base of wireless customers. Verizon has been strategically investing in emerging technology such as Verizon Digital Media over the past few years. AOL's business compliments Verizon's future growth prospects which made this acquisition a no brainer. This acquisition gives Verizon another outlet for the future growth. We might see it launching online video streaming and personalized videos as well for the mobile devices. The future of the video technology is moving towards the mobile devices, and Verizon's acquisition has been timed nicely as this segment has started to see some real growth. The growth in mobile service providers and operators is likely to fall in the near future which has prompted these telecom companies to add new revenue streams to their businesses. Verizon can expand beyond the telecom industry's limitations by using its extensive network to enter an entirely different industry. With AOL, Verizon is getting a ready-made platform which will make it a key player in the digital media services market. After the acquisition Verizon has become a global media player, reaching to millions of people at low cost. The cost synergies that would result will be substantial. Verizon will be able to target customers with different demographic characteristics for its mobile advertising which will make it preferred platform for the advertisers. The combination of both these companies will result in a net-positive for Verizon and its shareholders. Mobile ads and digital media content - paid as well as free - are the main growth areas in the communication industry at the moment. The internet speeds are rising and the demand for video streaming is growing at a rapid pace. Conventional advertisement mediums might become a thing of the past in the near future - Verizon's acquisition of AOL will make it a key player in this area and result in considerable growth.
