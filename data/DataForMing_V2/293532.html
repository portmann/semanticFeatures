The battery meter doesn’t update the percentage displayed, causing some folks to see their phones go dark when it appears there’s plenty of power left. Apple said in a post that the bug happens when users manually change the time on their iPhones or move between time zones, like when you’re traveling or changing the time for daylight savings. The company says that it’s aware of the issue, “and is investigating the cause and a solution.” In the meantime, Apple suggests users should restart their iPhones, then enable the automatic time setting within “Date & Time” settings.
