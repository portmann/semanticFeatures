America's Cash Flow Negative Energy Companies Have $325 Billion In Debt Among Them | Zero Hedge Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! Do NOT follow this link or you will be banned from the site! With the topic of distress among U.S. oil and gas exploration and production companies becoming more important with every passing day that oil not only continues to drop, but certainly fails to rebound to levels that allow US energy companies to return to a cash flow positive state, we would like to show just how much debt is at stake. To do that, drawing inspiration from a tweet by J Pierpont Morgan , we have conducted a quick CapIQ sort through all US energy companies - both public and private - that have at least $100 million in annual revenue, and whose EBITDA less CapEx was a negative number in the LTM period. To be sure, this gives listed companies the benefit of not only higher EBITDA in the early quarters when the drop of oil was not as severe, but also of oil price hedges. As such as the true negative cash flow going forward assuming no rebound in the price of oil for the foreseeable future will be far worse as the benefit of the base effect dissipates with every passing quarter and as oil price hedges, which have so far cushioned the oil price blow, are unwound. There are roughly 80 U.S. companies that had $100mm in LTM revenue and that had negative FCF or EBITDA less CapEx. The combined market cap of these 80 companies is just shy of half a trillion dollars. The combined Total Enterprise Value of these 80 companies is $775 billion. The combined debt of these 80 companies is $325 billion. None of these companies are bankrupt, yet. As a reminder, putting as many of these companies out of business, and thus slashing non-OPEC oil production (as OPEC forecasted in its latest bulletin earlier today), is the primary motive behind Saudi Arabia's relentless pumping spree. There is just one problem with the Saudi plan: even assuming all of these companies file Chapter 11, all that would happen is their debt would be wiped out, with the existing creditors getting the equity keys, and becoming the new owners of streamlined, debt-free corporations. This would means that the All In Cost Of Production would plunge as no debt payments would have to be satisfied with the free cash flow. Meanwhile, the entire existing E&P infrastructure would still be in place and ready to pump as before. This means that after the default and debt-for-equity deluge, US shale would be able to pump even more at far lower breakeven costs, forcing Saudi Arabia to overproduce for even longer ultimately shooting itself in the foot when its reserves run out! Of course, none of this is any comfort for those who have exposure to the pre-petition debt, which may explain why various regional Feds are suddenly so very defensive when it comes to US banks and other lenders who are on the hook when the default tsunami finally hits.

You are assuming the Saudi's are the one's pulling the strings to bankrupt these companies. You know better. Again you need to ask the FED this question along with the others in your previous article when Dallas Fed replied. It is the FED and its owners who are trying to get hard assets by theft as usual.

Mon, 01/18/2016 - 16:43 | 7063587 Make_Mine_A_Double One of my competitors offered roughly the same product/service as mine, but at a roughly 40% discount to breakeven operating costs - forget profit. My competitor is a foreign corporation heavily indebted in USD loans and holder of massive asset overbuilding that has to be utilized under bank covenants. So for him anything USD is tall clover and assets utilization is a bonus. However, all of this is being done at an overall loss - a substantial one at that. So the meme seems to be - accure USD, fuck the market upside since we'll worry abou that tomorrow. I'm scratching my balls wondering how the hell I am supposed to operate in a net negative enviroment since I do not have the luxury of no profit transactions. Mon, 01/18/2016 - 16:49 | 7063618 sschu Its called various things like mercantilism or dumping.  The seller is just concerned about covering their variable cost plus a little.  They are in survival mode. The Japanese made this approach famous in the 1980s, they in effect exported their unemployment. Mon, 01/18/2016 - 17:00 | 7063671 Spitzer Mon, 01/18/2016 - 17:08 | 7063708 PersonalRespons...

Mon, 01/18/2016 - 17:12 | 7063730 gatorengineer You bid the subcontract to one of your competitors suppliers and have him take the contract in local currency and you take the risk. I have a large subcontract with a canadian firm that they took in USD, at about parrity 3 years ago.  They are doing handstands and cartwheels right now.

Thats called dumping my friend and you should be on the phone to regulators ASAP. Your scenario is 100% illegal under US and Intl law re dumping.

So crashing the price never works? Most of these companies don't hedge production. Then they lock in royalties. They're all positive ebitda in a $50 oil environment. Oil needs to go to $10-15 for this to shit the bed. Mon, 01/18/2016 - 16:53 | 7063633 moonmac Those who loan out money foolishly deserves to lose it and deadbeats should be labeled as such. Instead our brilliant gubbermint bails out both the idiots and the bums. USA! USA! USA! Most participants in the energy derivatives market rely on a standard contract that was developed by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association and is recognized in the courts. The contract clearly specifies the rights each party has in the event of a default, said Robert Pickel, the association's chief executive. As of late yesterday, he added, the markets appeared ''to be fairly resilient in the face of extremely negative developments regarding such a major player.'' But at least one lawyer who specializes in swaps contracts indicated that it might be too soon to assess the full impact. That lawyer, Ann O'Hara, in Lincoln, Neb., said that her clients' anxiety about Enron had escalated sharply only in the last few days. ''No one believed it would really happen,'' she said. ''It is not a surprise, but it is a shock.'' ''We don't really know who is out there exposed to Enron's credit,'' she added. ''I'm telling my clients to prepare for the worst.'' Chicago, IL / Washington, D.C. -  David Almasi  of the National Center for Public Policy Research made himself the most unpopular person the room at the Boeing shareholder meeting in Chicago today after he asked company chairman and CEO W. James McNerney about conflicts of interest between Boeing's philanthropy and actions by senior public officials, and raised the question of whether Boeing had unnecessarily exposed itself to the danger of being prosecuted for honest services fraud. Almasi was following up on a April 13  Washington Post story  by Rosalind Helderman, who reported that Boeing made a $900,000 contribution to the Clinton Foundation and a $2 million donation important to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the same timeframe that Secretary Clinton made what she called "a shameless pitch" to Russia's state airline on Boeing's behalf. Almasi asked Mr. McNerney, in part (full question  here ): The official purpose of our Company's $900,000 donation to the Clinton Foundation was to build schools in Haiti. Assuming that building schools in Haiti was a key goal of this Company's philanthropic programs in 2010, why was it so important to support this work specifically through the Clinton Foundation, and not one of the many other reputable, independent charities then working in Haiti? By donating to the Clinton Foundation within months of receiving a huge favor from the Secretary of State, did we not expose both our Company and the Secretary of State to the risk of being charged with honest services fraud? There is at least one lobbyist in jail right this minute for giving public employees travel and meals worth far, far less than $900,000. He claims he didn't intend bribery; that what he did was business-as-usual. But he's in jail now, nonetheless. "Boeing should have been aware of all of this," added Ridenour. "During the same time period as the Boeing donations, the U.S. Supreme Court was hearing the honest services fraud case of Enron's Jeffrey Skilling. After the court ruled in that case, the  Washington Post's Amanda Becker reported  that "uncertainty remains about the [honest services] law's meaning." Boeing announced it won the Russian contract in  May 2010 ; Skilling v. United States was handed down in  June 2010 ; Boeing announced its gift to the Clinton Foundation in  August 2010 . Honest services fraud was headlining the newspapers at the very time Boeing apparently was considering a major gift to a foundation run by the husband of the sitting Secretary of State."

This is the first thought that came to mine, great, they'll lower the cost curve for the entire industry, all the debt will be bought by .gov, the marginal players fail and the big fish buy the assets for pennies on the dollar. Then the Saudi's will be completing with 10.00 bbl shale oil. Mon, 01/18/2016 - 18:13 | 7064000 pitz $10/barrel oil for a year or two at best.  New shale drilling, in a capital constrained environment, likely will need $100+.  Unlike during GM's bankruptcy, with the tug on the heartstrings that the prospect had of the "see the USA in your Chevorlet" company going out of business, and with pull that its union thugs had to bend bond holders over the table in a US taxpayer-funded bailout, nobody's going to bail out the oil companies. The availability at liquidation prices of the assets of enterprises that have overleveraged themselves out of business to parties smart enough to have the cash to do so -- that is how free markets correct themselves. And if a cohort of banksters go broke in the process along with their debtors, so much the better for the country.
