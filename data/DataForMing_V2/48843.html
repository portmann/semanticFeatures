Verizon Investors Should Worry About Future Subscriber Growth - Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) | Seeking Alpha To screen ETFs by asset class, performance, yield and more, check out the ETF Hub. ETF Hub VZ has gained well over 60% of its new subscribers from tablets the last year. NPD estimates that cellular tablet growth will slow from 90% last year to 10% in 2016. If you listen to Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) conference calls , iPad sales are falling, but if you read any of Verizon's (NYSE: VZ ) quarterly reports , it appears that tablet sales are driving growth. In reality, it's not that tablet sales as a whole are surging. Instead, it's cellular tablet connections in particular that are growing, whereas in the past Wi-Fi only tablets were being bought. The reason for this trend is innovation with carriers, all of which are now offering data bundling and monthly installment plans for consumers to purchase cellular tablets. So, if a subscriber can buy a cellular tablet for very little down and share data with what's already on their plan, then it would explain the increased demand we've seen for these devices over the last year. However, that growth and demand is not going to last, and that's especially bad for Verizon. According to research firm NPD , cellular data connections increased 90% last year versus 2013. This growth should serve as a reflection of the mass change we've seen in the telecom space throughout 2014, as more subscribers bundled data and elected to enter monthly installment plans for pricey hardware. However, NPD expects that growth to fizzle away quickly, with the market growing 30% this year and just 10% next year. Therein lies the problem for Verizon as 2015 progresses and 2016's subscriber growth guidance becomes a stock catalyst. The company's net tablet additions as a percentage of new subscribers is higher than its primary competitor AT&T (NYSE: T ), and has been a major reason for Verizon's ability to gan net additions at an impressive rate throughout the last year. Verizon's first quarter was no different with 621,000 4G smartphones added to its customer base and 820,000 4G tablets added during the quarter. Note: This does not reflect retail postpaid net additions, or subscriber losses. While Verizon appears to have added an enormous number of tablet connections in the first quarter, it was actually a bit conservative compared to previous quarters. Back in the second quarter of last year, Verizon had a total of 1.5 million new connections and 1.1 million were tablets. Nevertheless, the point is that tablet connection growth should begin to slow considerably in the quarters ahead. When it does, Verizon's subscriber growth will also fall rapid, something investors might not expect. Thus, this latest data from NPD is something all investors should keep in mind before deciding to own Verizon's stock long-term. In closing, I'll mention that AT&T investors should not worry as much. Yes, about half of AT&T's new subs are from tablets, but while Verizon has done nothing to grow its network in size, AT&T has now closed its deals to enter Mexico. This means that AT&T's network size just increased by about 100 million potential customers, a network that Verizon is yet to target. Therefore, the decline in cellular tablet connection growth may be a concern for the wireless industry, but it is a major issue for Verizon and its stock.
