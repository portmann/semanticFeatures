Ryanair Continues To Dominate The European Skies - Ryanair Holdings PLC (NASDAQ:RYAAY) | Seeking Alpha Ryanair just reported very strong FY 2015 results. The company once again was able to drive growth in earnings, revenue and passengers. Ryanair (NASDAQ: RYAAY ) reported fiscal full year 2015 results that were nothing less than excellent. The company appears to be truly firing on all cylinders. Earnings, revenue and passenger growth once again continued the sharp uptrend that has been seen over the last decade. This growth looks to continue for the rest of the year and beyond. The company looks to be in a fantastic spot to keep the perfect growth story alive and with it provide value for its shareholders. Just viewing the results it's easy to see that the company had an extremely strong fiscal 2015. With Q3 results the company had actually raised its guidance for 2015. The revised guidance had the company posting earnings of between €840m-€850m and instead the company actually beat, reporting earnings of €867. Of course this can be tied with yet another year of promising revenue growth. The overall massive jump in profits can be traced to a number of positive factors. The largest, and simplest, would be that the company saw a hefty increase in net margins. With costs in general down and demand up the company was able to translate these two positives into performance. While the rest of the airline industry continues to cheer about low oil prices, Ryanair is not getting the same impact as most. Since the company continues to maintain an extremely strong balance sheet it was able to hedge most fuel when oil prices were still high. The company ended up hedging roughly 90% of its production for fiscal 2016 at about $92. In fiscal 2015 the company also had 90% of its volumes hedged at $95. However, it did see some benefits from the 10% unhedged volume seeing as it translated into a 5% decrease in unit costs when including fuel. Excluding fuel unit costs things were actually flat, but were maintained as the lowest in Europe. With the prospects of lower oil continuing throughout fiscal 2016 the 10% unhedged volumes should help the company somewhat more than in fiscal 2015. Looking further ahead something the company has done that looks very attractive is already hedged 36% of its oil for fiscal 2017 at a price of $69. Considering the company was able to make $95 oil work in 2015, it should be able to make good use of the cost reduction in this aspect when fiscal 2017 rolls around. With passenger growth continuing its uptrend we see demand for Ryanair still growing sharply. Passenger growth once again surged in fiscal 2015, up 11%. Something that really catches the eye in fiscal 2015 results is the fact that the company will need to lease extra airplanes this summer to meet its demand as its current fleet of 320 is still not sufficient. Going even further into the future the company remains on track to grow its fleet size to 420 by 2019 and finally to 520 by 2024. The company expects to be serving an astounding 160M passengers by 2024 representing an over 75% increase from this past year. The demand for Ryanair flights is of course driven by the fact the company continues to be by far the lowest fare carrier in Europe. Below are the average fares for Ryanair compared with its direct peers. As it can be clearly seen no other airline in Europe even comes close to Ryanair's fares. On top of this Ryanair continues to dominate in being the lowest cost operator as well. Excluding fuel costs, average unit cost is just €29. This compares with the next closest peer having an average unit cost of €52. This gives Ryanair a significant amount of cushion in terms of competitive advantage. Both of these traits combined really make Ryanair the dominant name in Europe as it can almost be considered one of a kind. This dominance also has converted the airliner into Europe's number one carrier in terms of both market share and coverage. The company has remained quite positive on its summer season which for obvious reasons is always the strongest. It expressed that it has seen a favorable increase in forward bookings already and that traffic should be up by a couple of percentage points. However, the company has turned slightly cautious on the second half of its fiscal 2015. Winter is typically weak, and the company also is predicting some pricing response from competitors. This will probably be especially true from those who are benefiting the most from low oil. While this may be a concern, it is a minor one. The company still expects earnings to grow between 9-12%. Traffic also is expected to increase about 10% to 100M. Considering traffic in the year 2000 was only 6M this is truly an amazing feat. In conclusion, Ryanair has once again proved with fiscal 2015 results that it continues to dominate the European airline industry. The company saw a great continuation of its perfect growth story throughout its fiscal year. This growth is set to continue with its fleet size expected to grow by nearly 63% by 2024. Although the company may face some smaller headwinds in the second half of the year things are already looking bright for its fiscal 2017 when it sees more significant benefits from this low oil price environment. With Ryanair showing domination of the European skies through growth and performance watch for its shares to continue to see upside over the long term.
