Good afternoon and welcome to Envivio's fourth quarter fiscal 2015 earnings call. We're encouraged by our results and by the positive business environment as we head into fiscal 2016. While we have been impacted by the consolidation in the market, we're starting to see results from the increased adoption of our video processing software solutions in our customer base. We continue to penetrate our existing customer base. In the fourth-quarter, three U.S. service providers contributed significant revenue from incremental purchases of Envivio products and services. Additionally, we received an order from a leading Latin America Tier 1 customer, who chose Envivio for key expansions, products and services. This resulted in sequential topline growth in the fourth quarter. Revenue for the quarter was $12.7 million, up 42% sequentially. Over the last quarter, we have taken a number of initiatives to reduce our expenses and are pleased to report a reduction in our losses as we drive towards profitability. We intend to continue to invest in our long-term priorities to maintain our competitive advantage and to drive innovation in the video processing market along with our strong commitment to supporting our customers at the level they've come to expect from Envivio. Gross margins remain consistent at 65%, reflecting customer confidence in our software solutions. Our cash position is a steady at $37.8 million at quarter end, reflecting our increased revenues, cost containment efforts, and stronger collections in the quarter. As further validation of the company's differentiated products, this week Frost and Sullivan named Envivio the #1 global vendor for Live Video Transcoding in Media and Entertainment. This prestigious award highlighted Envivio for its innovation and for capturing the highest revenue share in this segment. It also recognized Envivio for being best-in-class of customer value and for offering a unified approach to new-age Pay TV Services. We're seeing accelerated interest and potential in the traditional Pay TV Services or the main screen opportunity. Major Pay TV operators are now considering virtualized software solutions like Envivio's to run their main screen services. This creates a significant additional market opportunity for Envivio's existing products and solutions as the majority of the revenue generated by Pay TV operators is still from the main screen. We're also seeing momentum in our Halo product line for ad insertion, Cloud DVR and just-in-time packaging applications. Our Halo volume of streamed process has more than doubled last year compared to the prior year and we're seeing traction for advanced video delivery and monetization solutions. The four main market drivers we outlined last quarter continue to shape the industry and we feel that we're well-positioned to capture the growing long-term market opportunity. Convergence, demand for new product compression technology, such as HEVC or High Efficiency Video Coding, the growth in personalization had monetization of the video service provider level and a longer term drive towards cloud-based initiatives. The important Tier 1 wins mentioned previously are representative of our video technology leadership coupled with flawless execution. Video quality, our rich feature set, our unique converged software architecture, and excellent customer and professional service execution are the key differentiators for these competitive wins. I'd also like to highlight a few additional strategic customer deployments. First, European mobile operator, Bouygues Telecom chose our Muse Video On-Demand encoding to power its multiscreen services in a fully virtualized software environment to millions of subscribers. Envivio enables Bouygues Telecom to significantly reduce their operating costs as well as to offer advanced media services while keeping storage and upgrades as streamlined as possible. Taiwan's largest mobile operator Chunghwa Telecom chose Envivio to power its 4K HEVC trial. This is the latest example of successful Envivio powered 4K HVEC pilots. 4K brings four times the resolution of high-definition TV, bringing an unparalleled quality of experience to consumers. HEVC lowers the bandwidth needed for video delivery by up to 50% compared to current technologies, therefore dramatically reducing the video network costs for operators. Envivio has seen significant traction in HEVC, thanks to its unique in-house developed implementation of these standards. We continue to strengthen the team. In February, Mike LaJoie joined the Envivio Board of Directors. Mike is a former CTO and EVP at Time Warner Cable and has more than 20 years' experience at the forefront of entertainment quality video. Mike has a deep understanding of Envivio's customers and technologies and we look forward to his contributions on the Board. This quarter, we're relocating to a new headquarters office in San Francisco. The purpose of the location is to be able to host our customers and partners with a comprehensive demo showcase and to access a rich talent pool in San Francisco to meet our staffing needs as we grow. We're very encouraged by our fourth quarter results and believe in our strategy to grow the business and return to profitability. There are a number of market drivers that bodes well for the future of the company and we feel that we're well-positioned to capitalize on the growing market opportunity. Now, I will turn the call over to Erik Miller, our Chief Financial Officer to provide a financial overview of the company. Thank you. Thank you, Julien. Good afternoon, everyone. Before I begin, please note that I will be discussing the financial results on a U.S. GAAP basis unless otherwise indicated. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures was included in our earnings release and can also be found in the Investor Relations section of envivio.com. Let me now discuss the results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2015 in more detail. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $12.7 million, compared with $9 million in the prior quarter and $12.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. The sequential revenue improvement was primarily a result of stronger sales of our software-based solutions to North American service providers. For fiscal 2015, revenues were $41.6 million compared to $43.2 million last year. The lower revenues for the year primarily resulted from an improvement in sales in the Americas offset by decreases in EMEA and the Asia-Pacific region. In the fourth quarter, our revenue from the Americas was $7.1 million compared to $3.5 million in the prior quarter and $4 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year. For the full year revenue in the Americas was 18.5 million compared to 17.4 million in fiscal 2014. A year-over-year improvement was principally a result of our improved sales in Latin America, partially offset by a reduction in sales to North American service providers due to industry consolidation. Our revenue in EMEA in the fourth quarter was 3.3 million compared to 3.3 million in the prior quarter and 4.9 million in the year ago period. For the full year EMEA revenue was 13.8 million compared with 15.6 million in fiscal 2014. The year-over-year decline was principally due to a challenging macroeconomic environment in Western Europe which continues. Our revenue in Asia Pacific in the fourth quarter was 2.3 million flat sequentially and down 3.6 million from the prior year. For the full year Asia Pacific revenue was 9.2 million compared to 10.2 million in the prior year. Our gross margin percentage for the fourth quarter was 64.9% compared to 64.2% in Q3 and 66.8% from Q4 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margins for these periods are the same as GAAP. For the full year gross margin was 63.6% compared to 66.2% in fiscal 2014. The decline in gross margins was due to lower software revenues in North America and an increase in systems sales in Latin America which tend to have lower gross margins. As we've mentioned before, we expect gross margin percentage to fluctuate based on product mix and geographic area of sales. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 were 8.6 million down from the prior quarters of 9.7 million and down from 9.5 million in the year ago quarter. For fiscal 2015 non-GAAP operating expenses were 38.9 million compared with 38.1 million in fiscal 2014. Non-GAAP R&D expenses for the quarter were 2.4 million compared with 2.2 million in Q3 and 2.2 million in the year ago period. Non-GAAP R&D expenses for fiscal 2015 were 9.3 million compared to 9 million in fiscal 2014. Non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses for the quarter were 3.9 million compared with 5 million in Q3 and 4.7 million in the year ago period. Non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses for fiscal 2015 were 19.2 million compared with 19.4 million in fiscal 2014. Non-GAAP general and administrative expenses for the quarter were 2.3 million compared with 2.6 million in the prior quarter and in the year ago period. Non-GAAP general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2015 were 10.5 million compared with 9.7 million in fiscal 2014. Our R&D expenses rose slightly as we continue to invest in technology development to maintain our leadership position. Sales and marketing, general and administrative expenses as well as total operating expenses declined sequentially as we continue to drive down overall costs in our progress towards profitability. Non-GAAP operating loss was 340,000 compared with the loss of 4 million in Q3 and a loss of 1.2 million in the prior year quarter. For the full year, non-GAAP operating loss was 12.5 million compared to a loss of 9.5 million in the prior year. The full year increase in operating loss was principally from lower revenues for the year and increased operating expenses. Stock-based compensation expense for the fourth quarter was 303,000 compared to 332,000 in Q3 and 646,000 in the prior year quarter. GAAP net loss for the fourth quarter was 1.6 million or a loss of $0.06 per share compared with GAAP net loss of 5.4 million or a loss of $0.20 per share in Q3 and GAAP net loss of 2 million or $0.08 per share in the fourth quarter of last year. For fiscal 2015 our GAAP net loss was 15.6 million or $0.57 per share. This compares with the GAAP net loss of 12.2 million or $0.45 per share for fiscal 2014. GAAP net loss for the fourth quarter was 548,000 or a loss of $0.02 per share compared with non-GAAP net loss of 4.1 million in Q3 or a loss of $0.15 per share. And non-GAAP net loss of 1.4 million or $0.05 per share in the fourth quarter of last year. For fiscal 2015 our non-GAAP net loss was 13 million or $0.47 per share. This compares with non-GAAP net loss of 9.8 million or $0.36 per share for fiscal 2014. Moving now to the balance sheet, total assets at the end of fourth quarter were 54.6 million compared with 54.7 million at the end of Q3 and 67.2 million at the end of the fourth quarter in a ago period. We ended the quarter with 37.8 million in cash, cash equivalents and short term investments, as compared to 37.9 million in cash, cash equivalents and short term investments at the end of the third quarter of 2015. Our deferred revenue balance at quarter end was 6.7 million compared with 5.2 million in Q3 and 6.7 million a year ago. The sequential increase reflects an increase in sales of our service level agreement and the commercial terms of some orders shipped in the quarter. Revenue from direct sales was 55% for the quarter compared with 76% in the prior quarter and 49% in a year ago quarter. For fiscal 2015 revenue from direct sales was 58% compared with 54% in fiscal 2014. We expect to split between direct and indirect sales to fluctuate based on customer mix. Our DSO for Q4 was 62 days compared with 89 days in Q3 and 78 days in the year ago period. As we've mentioned before we expect DSO to fluctuate based on geographic and customer mix. Total inventory at the end of the fourth quarter was 171,000, down from 293,000 in Q3 and up from 75,000 at the end of Q4 last year. We ended the quarter with a total headcount of 157 down from 166 in the prior quarter and 163 year in the prior year quarter. In the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect to have two non-recurring items impact our cash balance. In March 2015 we have paid approximately 1 million in cash in connection with settlement of the class action losses. This amount was previously accrued in our third quarter results from last year, so it will impact our operating expenses in first quarter but it will impact our cash balance in the first quarter. In the first quarter we also to expect to pay approximately $1 million for capital improvement associated with the relocation of our headquarters to San Francisco. To recap, we are pleased by our strong finish to an otherwise challenging year. We are encouraged by the increasing preference of our customers for fully converged software solutions, delivering not only multi-screen TV services, but also accelerating interest for our software solutions for traditional pay or main screen TV services as well. Additionally, we are encouraged by our improvement in our sales effort in Latin America as evidenced by our win this year of significant project in this region. We have taken steps to better align our costs with revenues and lower our breakeven point as we continue to drive toward profitability. We remain cautious about our customer’s spending patterns which can change from period to period and impact our quarterly revenues and we will continue to manage our operating expenses. We expect revenue expansion for the fiscal year 2016 as a whole which combined with a lower expense base will support our drive toward profitability. Thank you.
