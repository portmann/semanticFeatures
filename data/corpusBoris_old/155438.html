And Michael Rouleau will close the call with some summary comments. At the close, we'll open the call for your questions. Thank you, Jen and good afternoon, everyone and thanks for joining us on our call today. I will start with financial highlights of our fourth quarter performance. First, our comparable store sales for the quarter increased 3.6% compared to the same period a year ago. This increase was made up of an increase in customer transactions of 2.8% along with an increase in average ticket of 0.8%. It is very important to note however, I’m going to repeat that, it is very important to note however that in the fourth quarter of last year, we were in the final liquidation stages of our go forward merchandise, both apparel and overstocks of excess merchandise that contributed one-time non repeatable clearance sales of $10 million. If you exclude the impact of these one-time clearance sales, our fourth quarter 2015 core comparable store sales growth was up 8.5% and we believe this 8.5% comp on a go forward basis affirms the continued success of our revamped merchandise strategy and our overall operational improvements. I want to add though that starting fiscal year 2016 July 1, we are now past the clean up sales comparisons and our sales comparisons are finally apples to apples as we’re continuing in the rebuilding phase of Tuesday Morning. Inventory turnover continues to be stable and in Q4, a 2.6 turns consistent with 2.6 turns last year, a flat year-over-year inventory turn was driven by two factors. In the third and fourth quarters of this year, we’ve picked up some great deals that were holding the merchandise for use later in the season. In addition, we were low on inventory last year at the end of the fourth quarter as a result of our clearance efforts and we’re starting the fiscal New Year with inventory levels that we feel are more appropriate and normalized. Our cash balance of $44.8 million at the end of Q4 is below our balance of last year of $49.7 million. At the same time last year, we were liquidating excess clearance and exit category inventory as part of our turnaround program and this transition generated a lot of cash. We are pleased with our cash balance performance, which provide ample liquidity to fund our ongoing rebuilding program. Turning now to additional financial performance numbers for both the fourth quarter and 2015 fiscal year, starting with the fourth quarter, net sales were $213 million, representing a 0.2% increase versus the same period last year, despite a net decrease of 41 stores or a 5% decrease in number of stores from the fourth quarter last year as we continue to focus on improving the productivity of our store portfolio. We relocated 30 stores during fiscal year 2015. Our relocated stores saw sales up approximately 40% on average in the quarter and contributed 180 basis points to the overall 3.6% Q4 comparable store sales increase and we continue to get much better really at this effort. Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 34.4% compared to last year’s gross margin rate of 33.5%. SG&A expenses decreased slightly to $77.2 million compared to $77.5 million for the fourth quarter of last year. And as a percent of net sales, SG&A was 36.3% versus 36.5% in the same period last year. Our operating loss for the fourth quarter was $4 million compared to an operating loss of $6.2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. The Company reported a net loss of $4.2 million or $0.10 a share, a 43% improvement for the quarter as compared to last year’s net loss of $7.4 million or $0.17 a share for the quarter. Now for the year, net sales totaled $906 million, an increase of 4.8% from the $864.8 million reported last year, despite 5% or 41 store decrease year-over-year. Our comparable store sales increased for fiscal 2015 of 7.2% was made of an increase in customer transactions of 7% along with an increase in average ticket of 0.2%. Sales of the 43 stores relocated since the beginning of last year increased approximately 49% on average and contributed 150 basis points to our 7.2% comparable store sales growth for fiscal 2015. Gross margin was 36.0% compared to 34.9% last year. SG&A expenses were $314.3 million compared to $310.2 million in the prior year. As a percent of sales, SG&A for the year was 34.7% compared to 35.9% in the prior year. Our operating income was $12.4 million versus an operating loss of $8.1 million in fiscal 2014. The Company reported net income of $10.4 million or $0.24 per share for the 12 months ending June 30, 2015 versus our reported net loss of $10.2 million or $0.24 per share for the 12 months ended June 30, 2014. During the prior fiscal year, the Company executed a number of programs under its business turnaround initiatives, these turnaround programs included charges and senior management, board composition, exiting certain categories, cleaning up and reconfiguring stores, structurally reducing the level of clearance merchandise, enhancing Company policies and eliminating obsolete assets. As a result of these turnaround programs, the Company incurred additional costs and expenses in the prior year. To better understand the Company’s performance in fiscal 2014, financial results have been presented on both the GAAP and on an adjusted non-GAAP basis which excludes the turnaround imitative expenses incurred. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial results are included in our 10-K and our press release. In this respect, the Company’s fiscal 2014 fourth quarter results included $3.9 million in net pre-tax expenses for turnaround related SG&A expenses, inventory items and asset disposals as well as vacation policy change. Excluding these items, gross profit in the current quarter decreased 2% to $73.2 million compared to adjusted gross profits of $74.7 million a year ago. The Company’s gross margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 was 34.4% of sales compared to 35.2% of sales during the same period a year ago. 80 basis point gross margin decline is primarily due to increased supply chain costs, partially offset by markdown reductions as a result of our change to a broad and shallow purchasing strategy. SG&A for the 2015 fourth quarter was 36.3% of sales which compares to 36.6% of sales a year ago on an adjusted basis. Adjusted SG&A for Q4 fiscal 2014 excludes $300,000 in pre-tax net benefit for turnaround-related items. The 30 basis point improvement in SG&A leverage was driven by good cost management particularly at our stores. Our operating loss of $4.0 million increased $900,000 or 29% compared to $3.1 million operating loss on an adjusted basis in the fourth quarter of last year. In fiscal 2014, the company's results included a net $10.5 million in pre-tax expenses for turnaround-related SG&A expenses, inventory items and asset disposals, as well as the vacation policy change. Excluding these unusual items, the company's gross margin for fiscal 2015 was 36.0% versus 35.5% for fiscal 2014. The 50 basis point increase year-over-year in gross margin was due to reductions of markdowns partially offset by slightly lower initial merchandise markup. SG&A for the year was 34.7% of sales compared to last year's adjusted SG&A of 35.3% of sales. The 60 basis point improvement in SG&A leverage was driven primarily by strong store expense management. Excluding unusual items, our operating income increased from $1.8 million of adjusted operating income for fiscal 2014 to $12.4 million for fiscal 2015. Moving to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with inventory up 1.1% to $210 million compared to $207.7 million a year ago. Additional inventory is now in place to support our current and expected future sales trends during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. We are in the process of reducing our excess inventory and exiting certain categories. As noted above, our inventory turnover for the trailing five quarters is 2.6 turns identical to our prior year trailing five quarter turnover of 2.6 turns. This is a result of a more normalized inventory position as compared to Q4 last year when we were clearing our merchandise, making the transition to the replacement categories. As also noted previously, cash and cash equivalents were $44.8 million at June 30, 2015 compared to a cash and cash equivalent position of $49.7 million at the same time last year. There were no cash borrowings outstanding under the line of credit and availability on that line of credit was $100 million as of June 30. The modest decrease in our cash balance year-over-year is primarily due to our solid sales and profit growth partially offset by a more normalized inventory position in the current quarter versus heavy inventory liquidation in the prior year fourth quarter along with increased capital investments in the current year. During the fourth quarter, we invested $10.3 million in capital expenditures primarily for our new Phoenix, DC investments in systems and new and relocated and existing source. We expect to spend $40 million to $45 million in capital in fiscal ‘16 with the increase of over fiscal ‘15 driven primarily by the cost of our new Phoenix, DC. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 we opened two new stores, closed seven, relocated seven and expanded one store. During fiscal 2015, we opened six new stores, closed 47 and relocated 30. Our ending store count this fourth quarter was 769, down 41 stores or 5.1% from an ending 810 stores opened at the end of fiscal 2014 and we continue to be pleased with the productivity improvements that we are delivering across our store portfolio. Now I want to introduce Melissa Phillips, our President and Chief Operating Officer who will give you a look at the fall and Christmas selling season. Thank you, Michael. We continue to make good progress on our transition to a broad and shallow buying strategy. The strength in the ongoing business and the reduction in markdowns are both the result of our progress on this initiative. Our go-forward categories drove an 8.5% comp for the quarter with strength in summer seasonal, home decor, furniture, pets and crafts. I want to now give you an idea of what our expectations are for the following Christmas season. There are five key initiatives we are focused on to help prepare for the season. First, maximizing our fall and holiday last sales opportunities. If you remember from last year, we sold through our holiday merchandise very quickly and left money on the table in the later part of the season. The merchandising team has spent a lot of time analyzing the business, working with suppliers, and building an assortment that will enhance the treasure hunt shopping experience and capitalize on the opportunities that were missed last year. Second, gift giving. We know from talking to our customers that Tuesday Morning is a place they come to find high quality gifts and we believe this is a big opportunity for us this Christmas. In preparation for the gift giving season this year, the team has been working to put together impactful gift statements across categories. You will see us transition the front of the store to a much stronger statement of quality brands combined with more impactful in-store gift displays. Third, a steady flow of new receipts. The merchandising team is fully in place and is part of the broad and shallow buying strategy they are now spending the majority of their time out in the markets with suppliers finding deals and new goods. This has allowed us to continue to improve on our focus of maintaining a constant steady flow of new products hitting the stores every week. Fourth, store operations execution. On the store operation side, the in-store team is focused on 24 hours freight to floor for this holiday season. What 24-hour freight to floor means is that from the time a truck backs up to the store, the in-store team has 24 hours to get all of the new goods out to the sales floor to help support our treasure hunt shopping experience. As we ramp up our new goods going into holiday, this plays a crucial role in our success. Fifth is marketing. Historically, Tuesday Morning’s marketing strategy has been heavily dependent on item-focused circulars. In the past, we purchased deep quantities on a narrow assortment of items, resulting in stagnant inventory in our stores, heavy markdowns, and low inventory turnover. As we have transitioned to a broad and shallow treasure hunt experience, item-driven circulars do not support this strategy. Over the last three years, we have reduced our circular pages from 102 pages to 44 pages for fiscal 2016, over a 55% reduction. These changes have had a negative impact on our sale over the last two years but have resulted in markdown reductions, improved inventory turnover and a more exciting store. Our current focus is to optimize our print advertising for Christmas. We’re also beginning to work on building the roadmap for our future media strategy. To help us build this roadmap, we are working with the well-known advertising firm to partner with us on the development of a longer-term media strategy that will allow us to engage our existing customers as well as draw-in new customers. As we begin the fall and holiday season, the teams are excited about both the product and the preparation we have done. I would invite all of you to visit our stores in the next several months to see the progress we have made both with the merchandise and also with our in-store presentations. Thanks, Melissa. As we have now passed through the turnaround period and entered the rebuilding phase, we know that while this Company has a really good name to build on and is in the absolute sweet spot of retailing, there are many, many rebuilding projects that we have identified in the last 16 to 18 -- six to 18 months that we have prioritized and that we’re currently working on. This takes a lot of skill, capital and expense to execute and as we are rebuilding this Company to last, we’re going to make the right decisions for the long haul. I want to give you a few examples of what we’re currently working on. The first priority is for a strong fall and Christmas selling season. As Melissa said, we are optimistic about the upcoming seasons, as last year we were consumed with the turnaround and this is a very first season that we have enabled to prepare for with true focus and discipline and we’re looking forward to strong sales results accordingly. The second is our new Phoenix DC. This will be a very complex assignment as we need to integrate all of our systems to make our new DC operational. At this point, our goal is to open this new DC next summer in support of the fiscal ’17 fall and Christmas selling season, and we’ll keep you updated on our progress on future calls. Third, is to significantly improve our store portfolio. As you heard earlier, the sales results of both our new and relocated stores are meeting or exceeding our expectations and we are getting better at opening these stores all the time. Fourth, as Melissa discussed, is to develop a more effective marketing strategy as inefficient as circulars were in terms of bottom line impact, they did drive some incremental sales and we are pleased to have delivered the progress we have today, while at the same time carefully weaning our customers off the circulars that they had become accustomed to. With our new advertising agency, we are hard at work, devising the most impactful mix of marketing messages for our customers and we will take the same measured and disciplined approach as we layer in any of the changes. Fifth, a basic foundation for any company is the systems and the discipline that these systems enable. Just the sampling of few system initiatives that we are working on, for example, the system requirements of our new DC and Phoenix [indiscernible] a new company HR system and the launch of gift cards. Sixth, is to develop and import program with a supporting network. A large percentage of our unique product is manufacturing outside of the US. We have significant opportunity to improve on how we purchase and transport important merchandise. As part of our rebuilding, we’ve laid out a strategy that would provide buying and transportation support for the merchandising team in all key countries. As we execute this he strategy, it will allow the buyers more access to unique merchandise, all over the world. It will allow us to take control of the shipping and merchandise and significantly reduce transportation cost. As a result of these combined efforts, we expect to see sales growth momentum starting to build this year, however this is a year of serious investments in the rebuilding of the company, which we must do if we want to build this company for ongoing durable profitability. I am just going to make a few closing comments now, so what are the six things that we want you to take away from this call. First, the company has a good name to build on and we are positioned in a great industry, we operate business. Second, we started the operational turnaround about September 1, 2013 and completed late August of 2014, a one year effort. We then managed our way through Christmas and started with our rebuilding effort in January of this year, just some eight months ago. Third, as we now have transitioned into the rebuilding base, as you know, our company has never made the investments to effectively compete with the best. Everything was do what it takes to good buy and they did and as a result, we are going to have to make some major investments in the next year or two to rebuild this company, so that it can effectively compete with the best out there. Fourth, our confusing comp store sales comparison with discontinued and non-go-forward clearance sales are behind us and we are comparing with our own sales performance effective July 1, 2015. While we are in the process of rebuilding the company, we also expect, as I said earlier, to see our sales momentum start to build this year. Fifth, the success of this company is really all about the merchandise. As Melissa said, we have our buying team in place, our vendors are supporting us, our supply chain is improving every day, we are aggressively developing important program and we are expecting a good flow of new arrivals and are sourced throughout the season. Before I wrap up, as a point of emphasis, this year will be a year of intensive capital spending and additional expenses that we must make now in order to prepare for our future success. As a result of this decision, in fiscal 2016, we currently expect to deliver continued, comparable sales growth in the mid-single digit range and you should expect very modest operating margin improvement. Lastly, I want to make a few points regarding the expected quarterly cadence of our fiscal year 2016 sales and operating margin performance. We currently expect that in Q1 will be the last quarter this year where we are up against circulars in the prior year that we will not anniversary. As a result of our reduction in circulars in July and August, we currently believe that our comparable sales increase in Q1 will be at the low end of the mid-single digit expected range for this year. Q3 is currently expected to be the quarter where the ramp up of the DC impact to operating margins will be more significant driving an operating margin decline of over 100 basis points year-over-year. Third, we currently expect the very modest operating margin increase for fiscal ’16 to be driven by slight operating margin improvements in the first half of the year and more meaningful improvement in the fourth quarter. We appreciate your support as we rebuild this business and drive improvements that we believe will result in the continued sales productivity gains, operating margin expansion, and the ability to compete with the best. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Mann with Johnson Rice. Your line is now open, please go ahead. Yes, thank you good afternoon. Michael, in terms of the comments you made about the first quarter comp, you’re entering the quarter with more inventory, and you didn’t have that clearance comparison, can you talk a little bit more about the cadence that you’re seeing and what the impact of this circular reduction you think will be. Hi David. There is really few things that are impacting us in Q1. The first one we talked, the main impact is really the July and August shift with the reduced circulars versus last year and that’s really part of our ongoing initiative to reduce our dependency. So that’s the biggest impact and then the second piece is Q1 last year was an 11% comp for us so that is, we are up against a very large comp to LY. Okay. And then, secondly in terms of the gross margin that you reported in the fourth quarter. I think on the last call, the expectation was for gross margin to be up. So can you elaborate a little more on what some of the supply chain costs that were incurred and also some of the -- you know last year or this year, you have less clearance versus last year, so, would have thought that would have been some benefit also to gross margins, so some clarification. I’m answer that. Gross margins in Q4 I think was down about 80 basis points. So, here was the reason or learning as we’re going, with the shift, the broad and shallow, which is the way we’re now buying the merchandise. While we get off that, the markdowns and inventory turnover distribution costs went up. And the reason for it is that we have more frequent shipments of the stores because we want every store to receive a truck every week and we weren’t doing that for a while and then we have much more units to process in the DC itself, so our cost per unit didn’t go up, it equaled more dollars spent. So that was really what it was all about, it was all about DC costs. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Bienvenu with Stephens, Inc. Your line is now open, please go ahead. Yeah, thanks very much. Good afternoon. So you guys had highlighted in previous calls 50 million or so households in your demographics, you’re only tapping into 15% or 20% of those. Have you made progress on how you want to engage with those customer sets in light of your marketing focus that’s renewed? So that’s part of what we desired this firm to help us do. So we are in the very early stages of that, it is definitely one of the projects that we will take on with this new firm that we are just beginning that. Okay, fair enough. And then, thinking longer term, you’re building out a West Coast distribution center, do you have a sense yet as to how soon after you finish building your West Coast DC that you’ll decide to build one on the East Coast, do you expect it to be immediately thereafter or will you wait -- We’re just guessing now but I would say maybe, fiscal 2019, it will be -- I think it will be ways out there. Okay great. And then, maybe just lastly, touching on, the clearance headwind in the quarter. It had been moderating as we move through the year; it looks like it sort of bumped up in this fourth quarter. I’d be curious to hear your color -- additional color on maybe what drove that heavier than expected clearance headwind in the quarter? So I think part of the reason for that in the quarter is, we were up against the big clearance to LA and so you saw from the call that that was a -- it was a big headwind for us in the quarter, it was a large amount that we had clearance the year prior. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Mark Montagna with Empirical Capital. Your line is now open. Hi. Just when you get past 2016, being a year of investment, can we expect fiscal year ’17 to be more of a year of harvesting all that hard work and not very large investments? Well, I’d say this that we would expect that this year is going to be our heaviest investment year for sure and then while we always have investments going forward, but as I see it today or as we see it today, fiscal 2017 and beyond will be a really a more normal piece of investment. So you got a one-time blip next year which is pretty heavy and it kind of teases up for the future. Okay. And then for next year, what is your expectation in terms of the number of stores being relocated, store closures and then the year ending store count? Well, we started this year with 769 stores I believe. We’re closing, I think this year, we’re going to close 25, we’re going to relocate 40, we’re going to open up 16 new stores or going to end up at the end of this year with approximately 760 stores at year end and I would say probably next year, the numbers will be similar. Okay. And then just lastly, the DC for this year, it sounded like the completion date was pushed more towards the end of the fourth quarter as opposed to the end of the third quarter, I just wanted to verify that. No. So we had always intended for it to be, the ramp up costs, we do have built in to Q3, but the actual opening that we’ve always had planned for Q4. We’re still working through all that. I don’t think we’re ready to pinpoint an exact date yet. Our next question comes from the line of Taylor LaBarr with Stifel. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Thanks for taking my question. Just hoping for a little more detail around your plans for the holiday quarter. I think you said you had missed around $3 million or $4 million of sales previously, even with that, you saw a nice comp in the quarter and it sounds like you’re looking to more than make that up this year. So if you could just maybe extrapolate a little bit about your plans for the quarter and then also the dynamic you just spoke to about increasing the number of shipments to the store and that being a pressure on gross profit, is that also going to play out in the fourth quarter, if we see a strong comp number? So the big lost sales opportunity that we talked about last year was really focused on our seasonal categories. We mentioned that, we sold through seasonal very quickly last year. So we did -- we’ve spent a lot of time analyzing that and we are positioned in a much better place this year specifically with our seasonal categories as we go in to the holiday season. And then on -- as Michael said, on the distribution costs, with the broad and shallow strategy, it does make it where we are shipping more often to the stores, which is a good thing for the stores, because they will get new goods more often, but it has increased the costs from a supply chain perspective. Okay. Great. And then I know in anticipation of working with the ad agency and kind of developing your marketing strategy, you had done some preliminary work on your customer, I think some survey work, just wondering if you could share any of the learnings you took from that early work in to who your customer is and any insights from that? Yes. So we did -- before we hired the agency, we had done some very high level preliminary work that was really focused on our existing customers. So the first round was really about who that existing customer is and we found, what came out of it, as we know, she is more mature, we know that she has a higher discretionary spend than the average retail customer. So, there were some interesting findings there. The next phase with this ad agency, right now they are really focused on two things. They are focused on the long-term media strategy, so we just started working on that. The other thing that they are working on for us is really what our future brand positioning will be for Tuesday Morning. So, look, feel for website, email, in-store experience and as part of that we will do another level of research both existing customers, but we will also talk to prospective customers as well as part of that. Our next question comes from the line of Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Hi, this is actually Cody on for Aram Rubinson. Just a quick question, you guys have done a really good job on the traffic side. What are your prospects on the ticket side? Should we see a bigger increase than we saw this quarter? Cody, what we're seeing is, we are seeing a pretty stable level on the average ticket. The good that we are seeing really is on the transaction side and we don't see that changing as we move into the rest of next year. So I would say, you should expect pretty stable average ticket but the main growth driver being in transactions. Then just a quick question on the quality of your merchandise. Now that you’ve lapped your subs, the clearance event, do you guys still feel like there is more work to be done on the quality side or do you think you are ready to go? I would say, we are continuously working on that and I think that we still think there is lots of opportunity with broad and shallow to continue to increase our sell-throughs and leverage on the markdown side. So it’s something that we are working on continuously. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Okay, great, thanks. Just a follow-up question on the ticket. As you guys increase deliveries to the stores and improve store inventory and I guess in stock within the store, should we start to see a little bit bigger pickup in the average size of your basket? Shouldn't ticket be a bigger driver as we look out over the next year or so given the focus there? I mean, I think that that is definitely something that we can continue to watch, but I would say, if you look at the business trends right now and what we have been seeing is we’ve definitely seen the bigger growth coming from transaction. So it’s something we always watch and we will continue to pay attention to as we move through the rest of the year. Got it, okay. And then when you look at the relocated stores, the 40% lift that you're getting there, it’s a little bit lower than we've seen in prior quarters. Any more color on the performance there and how you would expect that to perform in the year ahead? Thanks. I know how the circulars have affected that, but they did affect those two and so I don't know the answer to that. Yeah, I think that the 40%, there is a lot of things underneath that number. I would tell you that we continue to be pleased with both the comps that we are seeing in the relocation stores and also just the sales volume that we're seeing in the stores. Actually we continue to see improvement there with the stores that we are opening. I mean, I know we are getting better every store we open, so we're not getting worse, we are getting better. So I feel very confident about where all that’s taking us. Okay. And then, as you look to the fourth quarter where I think you mentioned the EBIT margin should start to accelerate at that point, is that a function of the DC going live and being able to leverage some of those costs or are there other factors that you are considering there? Yes, that is with the DC going live and the cost leverage. That is the Q4 improvement that we see. I am showing no further questions on the phone lines at this time, I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Rouleau for closing remarks. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

Tuesday Morning Corp. released its FQ4 2013 Results in their Earnings Call on August 20, 2015.
