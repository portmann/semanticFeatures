Covisint Corporation: Former Spinoff Trading At Attractive Valuations - Covisint Corporation (NASDAQ:COVS) | Seeking Alpha Covisint is cheap because of share sales by shareholders who were distributed shares from its parent and its weak fiscal 2015 financial performance resulting from the implementation of strategic initiatives. The catalyst for value realization will either be an improvement in financial performance or a trade sale to a larger player. Target price implies 44% upside, assuming conservative assumptions of zero subscription revenue growth and an EV/Revenue multiple of 1.0 times. Covisint Corporation (NASDAQ: COVS ) is a former spinoff, whose share price has been depressed by selling pressure from its parent's shareholders and a below-par financial performance resulting from strategic initiatives during the transition period. If it executes on its plans to focus on its core subscription software business and build strategic relationships, it should experience a positive re-rating of its valuations. On the other hand, if Covisint fails to live up to expectations, a strategic buyer still might be attracted to its cheap valuations and acquire the Company. I arrive at a target price of $2.81 for Covisint by applying a 1.0 times EV/Revenue multiple to my estimated fiscal 2015 recurring subscription revenue of $66.7 million. My target price implies a 44% upside from Covisint's share price of $1.95 on April 29, 2015 Listed in October 2013 and completely spun off from Compuware Corporation in October 2014 , Covisint is a leading provider of B2B cloud engagement platforms. Covisint boasts a global client base of over 1,000 companies and connects over 200,000 organizations with its platforms. Its largest customer, General Motors (NYSE: GM ), accounted for 26% of its fiscal 2014 (year ended March) revenues. There are two key factors contributing to Covisint's cheapness, with the stock trading at a trailing twelve months EV/Revenue of 0.39. The first factor relates to the indiscriminate selling that most micro-capitalization spin-offs face. The second factor pertains to Covisint's disappointing financial performance in the first nine months of fiscal 2015 (year ended March). Since its spinoff from Compuware was completed on October 31, 2014, Covisint's share price has declined by approximately 32% from $2.89 to close at $1.95 on April 29, 2015. In the October 2014 spin-off, Compuware distributed all of its 31.3 million shares in Covisint as dividends to existing Compuware shareholders. Prior to being delisted, Compuware was a multi-billion dollar market capitalization stock that was part of the Russell 3000 Index . Compuware's former shareholders such as mid-cap funds benchmarking their performance with specific market indices will naturally be compelled to dispose of holdings in a micro-cap stock like Covisint with a market capitalization under $100 million. Putting spin-off dynamics aside, Covisint's financial performance in the first nine months of fiscal 2015 has hardly been encouraging. Its 9M FY2015 revenue and gross profit declined by 10.5% and 28.4% year-on-year respectively to $72.2 million and $37.4 million. Covisint's operating loss also widened from $10.3 million to $17.7 million over this period. Management has guided for subscription revenue growth to remain flat year-on-year for FY2015, and total revenue to decline by between 9% and 11% for the full fiscal year. The weak financial performance for fiscal 2015 is partly attributable to poor execution, and partly due to strategic initiatives to transform the business. The Company is making a shift from its lower margin services business to its core subscription software business, and service revenues are expected to be down by 24%-34% for the full fiscal year 2015. Also, Covisint's financial performance was negatively impacted by its exit from the healthcare application business. The exit process is expected to be completed by end of fiscal 2015. To sum up, fiscal 2015 has been a transition year for Covisint, as it navigates the transition from software/services to software focus and exits its unsuccessful healthcare application business (it entered the healthcare vertical in 2006). As highlighted above, some of Covisint's strategic initiatives have been the source of short-term financial pains for the Company in fiscal 2015, but these actions are expected to pay off in the mid-to-long term. A decline in overall revenue during the transition phase shifting from non-recurring revenue and lower margin services business to its core subscription software business, should result in higher profit margins and a higher proportion of recurring revenues down the road; while exiting its healthcare application business will free up managerial attention for the more profitable and promising business opportunities within the Company. Other strategic initiatives include the establishment and maintenance of relationships with strategic partners, and cost reduction initiatives. Early last year, Covisint signed a new agreement with Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO ) to embed its technology within the Cisco exchange platform. At the recent Q3 FY2015 earnings call, CEO Sam Inman disclosed that the Company "signed a teaming agreement with another large Silicon Valley Technology Company." One example of Covisint's cost cutting plans includes the relocation of its headquarters from downtown Detroit to the Travelers Tower II building in Southfield, which should lower rental costs. Another example is Covisint's workforce reduction in Q4 FY2014 to align the Company's cost structure with the transition to a subscription software business focus and an exit of the healthcare application business. With these strategic initiatives underway, Covisint has set long term targets of improving its gross margin from 50% to 70% and moving from an operating loss position to a positive 20% operating margin. This will be partly driven by the increase in subscription revenue as a percentage of total revenue from 69% currently to 80% in the long run. If Covisint makes good progress in moving towards these targets, it should see its valuation multiple rerated positively in line with the growth in revenue and operating earnings. Alternatively, if Covisint does not gain traction with its strategic initiatives, its cheap valuations could potentially attract the entry of a strategic buyer. Given the importance of scale economies in building up a software company, the end-game for Covisint's shareholders could be an acquisition by a larger player with the revenue base and financial resources to support the expansion of Covisint's operations. I arrive at a target price of $2.81 for Covisint by applying a 1.0 times EV/Revenue multiple to my estimated fiscal 2015 recurring subscription revenue of $66.7 million, and adding net cash of $43.3 million. Covisint achieved recurring subscription revenue of $66.7 million in FY2014, and the Company should be able to deliver similar numbers for FY2015 assuming flat subscription revenue growth. Listed SaaS companies have historically traded between 3-5 times EV/Revenue. To account for Covisint's significantly smaller market capitalization and the execution risks associated with its transition process, I choose to apply a lower EV/Revenue multiple of 1.0 times.
