Fifth Street Senior Floating Rate's Fiscal Q3 2016 NAV Projection, Indication Of An Undervalued Stock - Fifth Street Senior Floating Rate Corp. (NASDAQ:FSFR) | Seeking Alpha Consistent with most BDC peers, I anticipate Fifth Street Senior Floating Rate will record net appreciation within the companyâ€™s investment portfolio during the fiscal third quarter of 2016. I believe the company's current valuation has not fully priced in this price appreciation, and it continues to trade at an attractive discount relative to most BDC peers. In addition, all of Fifth Street's debt investments are floating-rate in nature, which will be beneficial as LIBOR increases. The company also has minimal exposure to oil & gas investments. When compared to sector peers, its investment portfolio also has a very low weighted average cash LIBOR floor, which will likely enhance interest income by the end of 2016. In addition to my BUY, SELL, or HOLD recommendation and price target, this article provides some positive and negative catalysts/factors to consider when choosing Fifth Street Senior as a possible equity investment. Author's Note: This article provides a detailed analysis with supporting documentation on Fifth Street Senior Floating Rate Corp.'s (NASDAQ: FSFR ) projected net asset value ("NAV") per share as of 6/30/2016. I perform this detailed analysis for readers who anticipate/want such an analysis performed at periodic intervals. For readers who just want the summarized conclusions/results of the NAV projection analysis, I would suggest to scroll down to the "Conclusions Drawn" section near the bottom of the article. The focus of this article is to provide a detailed projection of FSFR's NAV per share as of 6/30/2016. Prior to results being provided to the public after markets close on 8/9/2016 (via the company's quarterly press release), I would like to analyze its NAV as of 6/30/2016 and provide readers a general direction on how I believe this recent quarter has panned out. I will also include my quarterly "net investment income" ("NII") and "earnings per share" ("EPS") (also known as "net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations") projections in this article. Before we begin the company's NAV projection analysis, I wanted to provide readers my current thoughts in regard to FSFR as a possible equity investment. This will help readers better understand what is currently occurring within the company regarding several key metrics and assist when reading the NAV projection analysis. My current BUY, SELL, or HOLD recommendation and price target for FSFR will be at the bottom of this section of the article. Currently, I believe there are eight reasons why FSFR should be considered an attractive equity investment for readers. To remain prudent/non-bias, I also believe there are a few "cautionary/negative" factors to consider as well. Let us first discuss the positive factors. First, it trades at a material discount to my projected NAV as of 6/30/2016 (this specific per share amount is provided near the end of the article). As of 8/5/2016, FSFR's stock price was $8.51 per share. This calculates to a discount of ($2.79) per share for a price-to-NAV ratio of 0.7530 (a 24.70% discount). I believe investors should see this material discount to NAV as an attractive opportunity to own FSFR. Even though FSFR had an annual forward yield to its NAV as of 3/31/2016 of only 8.05%, the company had an annual forward yield to its stock price as of 8/5/2016 of 10.58%. I believe this yield, which is currently in excess of 10.00%, is one positive catalyst/factor of owning FSFR. Second, even though the company materially reduced its monthly dividend per share rate from $0.10 per share to $0.075 per share beginning in September 2015 (which was a negative factor when it occurred), this more cautious dividend per share rate continues to have a higher probability of being maintained over a long period of time. I believe investors have "come to terms" knowing this previous dividend reduction occurred and are now accustomed to the recent/steady $0.075 dividend per share rate. Third, FSFR has formed a joint venture ("JV") partnership with members of the Glick family (GF Funding) to expand the company's investment portfolio. This JV partnership is called "FSFR Glick Family JV LLC" (FSFR Glick JV) and was formed during the fiscal first quarter of 2015. Management has continued to state the company expects to generate an annual low-teens return in regard to this investment vehicle. When fully funded, FSFR Glick JV is expected to generate annual returns approximately 500 basis points ("bps") above FSFR's average return on investment ("ROI"). This is due to the fact that management fees are based on the net assets of FSFR Glick JV (not gross assets), which is a strategic advantage. In addition, by utilizing JV partnerships, FSFR can "circumvent" the business development company ("BDC") debt-to-equity leverage ratio threshold of 1.0x, while still maintaining the company's Regulated Investment Company ("RIC") status per the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC"). As of 3/31/2016, FSFR Glick JV had $211.4 million in total assets, of which $200.2 million consisted of senior secured loans. This funding has been provided through equity by both partners and through FSFR Glick JV's $200 million revolving credit facility with Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands (Credit Suisse). Management anticipates FSFR Glick JV will have an investment capacity of approximately $300 million. The volatile nature of credit markets during FSFR's fiscal first and second quarters of 2016 (which led to a notable drop in loan originations throughout most of the BDC sector) negatively impacted the expansion of FSFR Glick JV. However, as will be further discussed later in this article, loan originations throughout most of the BDC sector likely "picked up" during the calendar second quarter of 2016 (FSFR's fiscal third quarter of 2016). Even though I am projecting FSFR Glick JV was still not fully "ramped up" as of 6/30/2016, I do anticipate a net increase in portfolio investments during FSFR's fiscal third quarter of 2016. This should directly lead to higher fee, dividend, and other income being reported by FSFR Glick JV when compared to the prior quarter. I expect FSFR Glick JV will increase its investment portfolio to full capacity within the next several quarters. As the JV continues to grow, the benefits of this type of investment structure should begin to have a more meaningful impact on FSFR's earnings. FSFR has also stated the company will likely have future discussions with other interested third parties to create additional JV partnerships over the next several years. I believe the strategic advantages of these types of JV partnerships should be seen as a positive catalyst/factor. Fourth, FSFR has continued to expand its available borrowings. In June 2015, management announced the refinancing of the company's previously amended $200 million Natixis/Fifth Third Bank Revolving Credit Facility/Term Loans by closing a $309 million debt securitization. In conjunction with this event, FSFR issued $223 million of long-term notes, which are secured by the company's underlying portfolio investments. These long-term notes are termed the"2015 Notes" and have five different classes. The weighted average interest rate for the five classes is based on the three-month "London Interbank Offered Rate" (LIBOR) plus 2.01%. The debt securitization has a four-year reinvestment period and a ten-year maturity. As such, FSFR extended the maturity of a material portion of its borrowings at attractive financing rates. Even though an increase in LIBOR will cause an increase to FSFR's cost of funds rate, the company has nearly 100% of its investment portfolio in senior secured, variable-rate debt investments. As such, any increase in interest expense will be "trumped" by an increase in interest income once FSFR's weighted average cash LIBOR floor is surpassed (which continues to be one of the lowest in the BDC sector). Furthermore, in all likelihood, net interest spreads will increase as the "base rate" on all new lower middle market ("LMM") and middle market ("MM") loans will be at a higher stated rate in a rising interest rate environment. Furthermore, in January 2016, FSFR announced a new revolving credit facility with East West Bank that matures in 2021. Even though this five-year, $25 million revolving credit facility is fairly small when compared to other sources of financing, I believe creating another financing alternative should be seen as a positive catalyst/factor. Fifth, as briefly referenced in the factor above, the company continues to maintain a portfolio of debt investments with a very low weighted average cash LIBOR floor. As of 3/31/2016, FSFR's investment portfolio had a weighted average cash LIBOR floor of 0.92%. In fact, at the start of the quarter, it already had several debt investments which surpassed its cash LIBOR floor. As such, each debt investment's interest rate has recently "reset" a little bit higher. Since it would appear current/("spot") LIBOR will not be "skyrocketing" higher at any specified point in time (gradual increase over time likely), most portfolio companies should be able to handle the small, gradual increase in stated interest rates. In addition, 100% of FSFR's debt investments are "floating-rate" in nature (as opposed to "fixed-rate"). Right now, I believe market participants are not fully pricing in this distinction. When the Federal Open Market Committee ("FOMC") eventually continues to increase the Federal ("Fed") Funds Rate (current indications under a more bullish scenario is now just one rate hike during 2016), a BDC's weighted average cash LIBOR floor will determine when the investment portfolio will begin to see an impactful net benefit due to rising short-term interest rates/LIBOR. This directly determines when FSFR's NII will increase accordingly. I believe FSFR's near-100% floating-rate investment portfolio, along with the company's very low weighted average cash LIBOR floor should be seen as another positive catalyst/factor. Sixth, management has continued to reiterate FSFR does not anticipate issuing shares of common stock below CURRENT NAV over the foreseeable future. Even though I have stated in the past I was against the August 2014 equity offering (due to the fact it was materially dilutive to existing shareholders; at the time, I did not own this stock), I remain comforted management will not perform any further dilutive actions over the foreseeable future. I believe this notion has been solidified from the recent expansion of the company's financing, which was discussed earlier. Seventh, the material net decrease in the price of crude oil during the second half of 2015/early 2016 has caused "distress"/speculation to surround most of the oil & gas sector (including parts of the energy sector) regarding lower cash flows, difficulties accessing additional credit, and potential bankruptcies. While I would agree markets should have some "cause for concern" within the high-yield debt market, I also believe one needs to "drill down" to each BDC's debt and equity investments to see which portfolio companies could be affected by this negative event. After experiencing a nice "rebound" in crude oil prices during most of the second quarter of 2016 (along with a notable rebound in some oil & gas loan prices), another move lower in crude oil prices occurred during July 2016, which negatively impacted most oil & gas loan prices once again. The prolonged decrease in overall prices over an extended period of time has begun to cause some companies in the sector to declare bankruptcy and/or restructure their debt/capital structure. Simply put, this increases the amount of "charge-offs", reserves, and/or non-accruals within financial companies (including the BDC sector). However, with that being said, only 0.63% of FSFR's portfolio had debt and equity investments within the oil & gas sector (including certain investments in the energy sector which had "oil & gas" characteristics) as of 3/31/2016. When compared to ten other BDC peers I currently cover, this was one of the lowest percentages at potential risk for investment depreciation due to prolonged low crude oil/natural gas prices. As of 3/31/2016, I calculated Apollo Investment Corp. (NASDAQ: AINV ), Medley Capital Corp. (NYSE: MCC ), Main Street Capital Corp. (NYSE: MAIN ), and Prospect Capital Corp. (NASDAQ: PSEC ) had a 11.89%, 5.05%, 4.46%, and 3.35% exposure to the oil & gas sector, respectively (including certain investments in the energy sector which had oil & gas characteristics). I believe FSFR's continued extremely low exposure to the sector should be seen as a positive catalyst/factor. Finally, in what is more of a BDC sector trend, there has recently been notable price increases for most LMM and MM loans, as most types of global/U.S. yields have continued to decrease along with a decrease in high-yield debt volatility (including the broadly syndicated loan market). Simply put, this should be seen as a recent positive sector catalyst/factor. Now let us discuss three cautionary/negative factors. The first factor is in relation to FSFR's external manager, Fifth Street Asset Management Inc. (NASDAQ: FSAM ) and the company's affiliate, Fifth Street Finance Corp. (NASDAQ: FSC ). Currently, FSAM, FSC, and certain members of each entity's prior/current executive management team/officers are defendants in several class action lawsuits where plaintiffs have alleged the defendants knowingly/fraudulently inflated asset valuations of several of FSC's portfolio companies prior to FSAM's initial public offering ("IPO"). While the lawsuits DO NOT state there was any "wrongdoing" on the part of FSFR, it should be noted the company has "overlapping" personnel with its affiliate, FSC. As such, these ongoing lawsuits may indirectly impact FSFR's business operations regarding management's time devoted to the cases (for instance, meeting with legal counsel, appearances in court to testify, etc.) and the potential for an eventual change in the executive management team/officers. At this point in time, I believe it is only prudent to consider the impacts this event may have on FSFR. Second, in relation to these events described above, the SEC has recently opened a formal investigation on FSAM, FSC, and several operating subsidiaries seeking documents related to several events, including issues raised in an earlier SEC inspection which began back in October 2015. Even though this investigation is NOT directed at FSFR, certain resolutions may eventually positively impact the company's shareholders (discussed below). Recent SEC subpoenas were issued partially as a result of the class action lawsuits previously filed (stated above) and are mainly related to the following topics: 1) valuation of FSC's portfolio investments prior to and immediately after FSAM's IPO; 2) management fees, incentive fees, and general expenses allocated/charged by FSAM to FSC and FSFR; and 3) several other formal topics in relation to (but not limited to) the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the Securities Act of 1933, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Simply put, I currently believe this open investigation is a cautionary factor for FSFR shareholders, and even possibly a positive factor in the future via a reduction in management/incentive fees and/or expense waivers. Again, the main reason for these class action lawsuits was a fundamental disagreement regarding the valuation of several of FSC's portfolio companies prior to and immediately after FSAM's IPO (not directly related to FSFR). It should also be noted FSAM is currently is in the process of proposing to settle most (if not all) applicable lawsuits. Third, consistent with most BDC peers, there has been a recent minor-to-modest uptick in the amount of debt investments being put on non-accrual status. This directly lowers the amount of interest income being accrued, which ultimately negatively impacts NII. Even though I anticipate FSFR will record net appreciation within its investment portfolio during the fiscal third quarter of 2016, several portfolio companies will likely continue to exhibit increased credit risk. A discussion of which specific portfolio companies are currently at heightened risk for investment depreciation/non-accruals is provided later in the article. I believe this is one negative factor to consider when FSFR reports quarterly results. My BUY, SELL, or HOLD Recommendation: From the factors provided above, including the analysis that will be provided below, I currently rate FSFR as a SELL when the company's stock price is trading at less than a (10.0%) discount to my projected NAV as of 6/30/2016 (provided below), a HOLD when trading at or greater than a (10.0%) but less than a (17.5%) discount to my projected NAV as of 6/30/2016, and a BUY when trading at or greater than a (17.5%) discount to my projected NAV as of 6/30/2016. As such, I currently rate FSFR as a BUY. I believe all of the cautionary/negative factors associated with FSFR are already "priced in" the company's current valuation, while some of the positive factors/catalysts are not. My current price target for FSFR is approximately $10.15 per share. This is currently the price where my recommendation would change to a SELL. When calculated, this would be price appreciation of approximately 20% from FSFR's current valuation. Note: Each investor's BUY, SELL, or HOLD decision is based on one's risk tolerance, time horizon, and dividend income goals. My personal recommendation will not fit each reader's current investing strategy. The factual information provided within this article is intended to help assist readers when it comes to investing strategies/decisions. Overview of FSFR's Projected NAV as of 6/30/2016: Due to the fact that several figures needed to project/calculate the company's NAV as of 6/30/2016 come directly from its consolidated statement of operations, I provide Table 1 below. Table 1 shows FSFR's consolidated statement of operations for a nine months-ended time frame. Using Table 1 below as a reference, one must add certain account figures from the fiscal first, second, and third quarters of 2016 for purposes of projecting a suitable NAV as of 6/30/2016. (Source: Table created entirely by myself, including all calculated figures and projected valuations) Having provided Table 1 above (in particular FSFR's "Fiscal Nine Months-Ended (ESTIMATE)" column), we can now begin to calculate the company's projected NAV as of 6/30/2016. This projection will be calculated using Table 2 below. (Source: Table created entirely by myself, including all calculated figures and projected valuations) Using Table 2 above as a reference, let us take a look at the calculation for FSFR's projected NAV as of 6/30/2016. Unless otherwise noted, all figures below are for the "nine months-ended" time frame. Let us look at the following figures (in corresponding order to the "Ref." column shown in Table 2, next to the June 30, 2016 column): Side Note: Predicting certain accounting figures within the BDC sector is usually more difficult when compared to other sectors, due to the fair market value ("FMV") fluctuations that occur within a company's investment portfolio each quarter. Specifically, the following two FSFR accounts are typically more difficult to project in any given quarter: 1) unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments; and 2) realized gain (loss) on investments. As such, there are several assumptions used when performing such an analysis. FSFR's actual reported values may differ materially from my projected values within this article due to unforeseen circumstances. This could occur because management deviates from a company's prior business strategy and pursues a new strategy that was not previously disclosed or anticipated. This could also occur when the company has a "one-time" extraordinary event which was previously unforeseen or disclosed. Readers should be aware as such. All projections within this article are my personal estimates and should not solely be used for any investor's buying or selling decisions. All actual reported figures that are above the mean of my account projections will be deemed an "outperformance" in my judgment. All actual reported figures that are below the mean of my account projections will be deemed an "underperformance" in my judgment. - Confidence Within Range = Moderate to High - See Red Reference "A" in Table 2 Above, Next to the June 30, 2016 Column This "net increase (decrease) in net assets from operations" figure consists of the following three amounts that come directly from FSFR's consolidated statement of operations: 1) net investment income (see blue reference "A" in Tables 1 and 2 above); 2) net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments (see blue reference "B" in Tables 1 and 2 above); and 3) net realized gain (loss) on investments (see blue reference "C" in Tables 1 and 2 above). Since I have not provided a quarterly consolidated statement of operations projection article for FSFR (due to time constraints), I will summarize what I believe will occur within these three amounts during the fiscal third quarter of 2016. Let us first discuss the company's NII account. - See Blue Reference "A" in Tables 1 and 2 Above, Next to the June 30, 2016 Column FSFR reported NII of $7.0 and $5.8 million for the fiscal first and second quarters of 2016, respectively. I am projecting the company will report NII of $6.1 million for the fiscal third quarter of 2016. Using Tables 1 and 2 above as a reference, when combined this is a projected NII of $18.9 million for the nine months ended 6/30/2016. LMM and MM lending as a whole witnessed subdued levels of loan originations during the latter half of 2015, which continued through the calendar first quarter of 2016. In fact, loan origination volumes across financial markets were either at or near multi-year lows at the beginning of calendar year 2016, mainly due to heightened volatility in global credit markets. As stated earlier, this trend modestly reversed course during the calendar second quarter of 2016 (FSFR's fiscal third quarter of 2016). I also anticipate loan originations will continue to "pick up" heading into the second half of calendar year 2016. While still below loan origination volumes seen during 2012 to the first half of 2015, I believe this is a recent positive catalyst/trend for the BDC sector as a whole. As such, even though I am still projecting the company had "below average" loan originations funded at close and add-on investments during the fiscal third quarter of 2016, I believe this amount will be modestly higher when compared to the prior quarter. When compared to quarterly loan originations funded and close and add-on investments of just $20.5 million during the fiscal second quarter of 2016, I am projecting FSFR had quarterly loan originations funded at close and add-on investments of approximately $100 million during the fiscal third quarter of 2016 (includes new/add-on investments that were ultimately transferred to FSFR Glick JV during the quarter). Due to more attractive pricing of LMM and MM debt investments during the fiscal third quarter of 2016 (when compared to the prior quarter), I am also projecting the company had higher loan sales/syndications. As such, I am projecting it had portfolio sales/repayments/syndications of approximately ($80) million during the fiscal third quarter of 2016. When combining the company's quarterly loan originations funded at close and add-on investments less portfolio sales/repayments/syndications, I am projecting FSFR's total investment portfolio increased approximately $20 million for the fiscal third quarter of 2016 (prior to all quarterly FMV fluctuations and scheduled principle payments). The projected increase in quarterly NII ($6.1 million for the fiscal third quarter of 2016 versus $5.8 million for the fiscal second quarter of 2016) is mainly attributed to projected slightly lower total investment income partially offset by a modest decrease in professional fees (most costs in relation to the activist investor were expensed during the prior quarter). Now, let us discuss FSFR's net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments account. 2) Net Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments: - See Blue Reference "B" in Tables 1 and 2 Above, Next to the June 30, 2016 Column FSFR reported net unrealized depreciation on investments of ($20.3) and ($1.6) million for the fiscal first and second quarters of 2016, respectively. I am projecting the company will report net unrealized appreciation on investments of $4.2 million for the fiscal third quarter of 2016. Using Tables 1 and 2 above as a reference, when combined this is a projected net unrealized depreciation on investments of ($17.7) million for the nine months ended 6/30/2016. During the fiscal first quarter of 2016, notable FMV depreciation occurred within FSFR Glick JV, Answers Corp. (Answers), B&H Education, Inc. (B&H), and Ameritox Ltd. (Ameritox). During the fiscal second quarter of 2016, notable FMV depreciation occurred within FSFR Glick JV, PR Wireless, Inc. (PR Wireless), and Ameritox. This was partially offset by notable FMV appreciation within Smile Brands Group Inc. (Smile) and PowerPlan Inc. (PowerPlan). As of 3/31/2016, FSFR's investment in Answers, PR Wireless, and Ameritox showed signs of heightened credit risk. I believe this will partially mitigate the likely notable increase in valuations across most of FSFR's investment portfolio during the fiscal third quarter of 2016. As stated earlier, this assumption is based on the notion of more attractive pricing of most LMM and MM debt investments during the fiscal third quarter of 2016 when compared to the prior quarter (including the broadly syndicated loan market). Based on this notion (and several other analytical factors), I am projecting the net change to this account partially consisted of depreciation within Answers, PR Wireless, and Ameritox. This factor will be more than offset by a notable decrease/tightening in volatility/spreads during April-May 2016, before somewhat "leveling off" during most of June 2016. As such, I am projecting the remainder of FSFR's investment portfolio experienced minor-to-modest FMV appreciation whenever credit risk remained low. This account's projection is formed from a detailed investment portfolio model that will be omitted from this article due to the sheer size of the data. Now, let us discuss the company's net realized gain (loss) on investments account. 3) Net Realized Gain (Loss) on Investments: - See Blue Reference "C" in Tables 1 and 2 Above, Next to the June 30, 2016 Column FSFR reported a net realized loss on investments of ($0.1) and ($4.8) million for the fiscal first and second quarters of 2016, respectively. I am projecting it will report a net realized loss on investments of ($0.3) million for the fiscal third quarter of 2016. Using Tables 1 and 2 above as a reference, when combined this is a projected net realized loss on investments of ($5.1) million (rounded) for the nine months ended 6/30/2016. This projection assumes a portion of the portfolio exits during the quarter were debt investments sold in the open market which slightly-to-modestly depreciated in value over each loan's cumulative lifetime. Even though I am projecting most LMM and MM debt investments experienced net appreciation during FSFR's fiscal third quarter of 2016 (as discussed earlier), a majority of loans likely still had cumulative depreciation as of 6/30/2016 (or when sold). As such, I am still anticipating a net realized loss associated with these types of sales to market participants. Let us now combine the three amounts described above to come up with a net increase (decrease) in net assets from operations figure for the nine months ended 6/30/2016. When combining NII of $18.9 million, net unrealized depreciation on investments of ($17.7) million, and a net realized loss on investments of ($5.1) million, I am projecting FSFR had a decrease in net assets from operations of ($3.9) million for the nine months ended 6/30/2016 (see red reference "A" in Table 2 above). - See Red Reference "B" and Blue Reference "D" in Table 2 Above, Next to the June 30, 2016 Column - See Blue Reference "D" in Table 3 Below Side Note: As shown in Table 2 above, FSFR's "net increase (decrease) in net assets from stockholder transactions" figure is the equivalent to the company's "distributions to stockholders from net investment company taxable income ("ICTI")" figure. Since this is the only amount within this specific classification, both figures will be the same. This is a fairly simple calculation. This is the company's dividend distributions for the fiscal first, second, and third quarters of 2016. (Source: Table created entirely by myself, partially using FSFR data obtained from the SEC's EDGAR Database ) Using Table 3 above as a reference, the number of outstanding shares of common stock as of 4/13/2016, 5/11/2016, and 6/13/2016 (ex-dividend dates) is projected to be 29.5 million. This figure is unchanged from FSFR's outstanding shares of common stock as of 3/31/2016. I am also projecting no shares of common stock were issued as part of the company's dividend reinvestment plan for the fiscal third quarter of 2016 (discussed later in the article). Since the common stock dividend declared for April 2016, May 2016, and June 2016 was $0.075 per share, I am projecting FSFR's dividend distributions totaled ($6.6) million for the fiscal third quarter of 2016. When this dividend distributions figure is combined with the six months-ended dividend distributions of ($13.3) million, I am projecting FSFR had a decrease in net assets from stockholder transactions of ($19.9) million for the nine months ended 6/30/2016 (see red reference "B" in Table 2 above and blue reference "D" in Tables 2 and 3 above). - See Red Reference "C" in Table 2 Above, Next to the June 30, 2016 Column This "net increase (decrease) in net assets from capital share transactions" figure consists of the following three amounts: 1) issuance of common stock, net (see blue reference "E" in Table 2 above and Table 4 below); 2) issuance of common stock under dividend reinvestment plan, net (see blue reference "F" in Table 2 above and Table 5 below); and 3) repurchases of common stock. - See Blue Reference "E" in Table 2 Above, Next to the June 30, 2016 Column See Blue Reference "E" in Table 4 Below This is FSFR's issuance of common stock, net of underwriting fees and offering costs for the fiscal first, second, and third quarters of 2016. Since the company did not have any equity offerings (which would result in the issuance of common stock) during the fiscal first, second, and third quarters of 2016, this figure should remain at $0 for the nine months ended 6/30/2016 (see blue reference "E" in Table 2 above and Table 4 below). (Source: Table created entirely by myself, partially using FSFR data obtained from the SEC's EDGAR Database [link provided below Table 3]) - See Blue Reference "F" in Table 2 Above, Next to the June 30, 2016 Column See Blue Reference "F" in Table 5 Below This is FSFR's issuance of common stock under the company's dividend reinvestment plan for the fiscal first, second, and third quarters of 2016. (Source: Table created entirely by myself, partially using FSFR data obtained from the SEC's EDGAR Database [link provided below Table 3]) Using Table 5 above as a reference, at times FSFR repurchases outstanding shares of common stock in the open market to distribute as part of the company's dividend reinvestment plan (net effect of 0 additional outstanding shares of common stock issued). This strategy is implemented when FSFR's stock price, at the time of dividend distributions, is priced at a discount to NAV. Since this variable was met throughout the fiscal third quarter of 2016, I am projecting the company will report an issuance of common stock under its dividend reinvestment plan figure of $0 for the nine months ended 6/30/2016 (see blue reference "F" in Tables 2 and 5 above). - See Table 2 Above, Next to the June 30, 2016 Column for Reference Management may intend to repurchase outstanding shares of common stock when FSFR stock is priced at a material discount to the company's NAV. Even though the stock price, throughout the entire quarter, continued to trade well below the company's NAV of $11.18 per share as of 3/31/2016, I am assuming management did not initiate any share buybacks during the fiscal third quarter of 2016. Therefore, I am projecting FSFR will report a repurchases of common stock figure of $0 for the nine months ended 6/30/2016 (see Table 2 above). If it repurchases outstanding shares of common stock in future quarters at this type of material discount, I believe that would be a positive catalyst/factor for the company, as this would be accretive to NAV. When combining net equity proceeds in common stock issuances of $0, net equity proceeds in relation to the company's dividend reinvestment plan of $0, and equity in relation to repurchases of common stock of $0, I am projecting FSFR had no change in net assets from capital share transactions for the nine months ended 6/30/2016 (see red reference "C" in Table 2 above). Conclusions Drawn (In Relation to FSFR's NAV Projection): To sum up all the information discussed above, I am projecting FSFR will report the following NAV per share as of 6/30/2016: FSFR's Projected NAV as of 6/30/2016 = $11.30 Per Share FSFR's Projected NAV Range as of 6/30/2016 = $11.10-$11.50 Per Share This projection is an increase of $0.12 per share from the company's NAV as of 3/31/2016. This increase in NAV can be attributed to the following quarterly per share changes: (Source: Table created entirely by myself, including all calculated figures and projected valuations) Using Table 6 above as a reference, I am projecting FSFR's net increase in net assets resulting from operations (also known as EPS) was $0.35 per share for the fiscal third quarter of 2016 (rounded to the nearest cent). In comparison, I am projecting the company had dividend distributions of ($0.23) per share for the fiscal third quarter of 2016 (also rounded to the nearest cent). When these two amounts are combined, an increase of $0.12 per share for the fiscal third quarter of 2016 is obtained. The main reason for the projected minor (less than 2%) increase in NAV is in relation to an increase in most LMM and MM loan prices (notable tightening of spreads) during the calendar second quarter of 2016 (FSFR's fiscal third quarter of 2016) partially offset by continued investment depreciation due to heightened credit risk/non-accruals in regard to several portfolio investments. The company's fiscal third quarter of 2016 should be seen as a more "upbeat" quarter when compared to the events witnessed during the prior several quarters. As such, I believe FSFR's upcoming quarterly results should be seen as a positive catalyst/trend.
