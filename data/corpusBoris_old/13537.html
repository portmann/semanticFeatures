Learn more about PRO » Dramatic increase in opportunities to deploy capital are being overlooked by the market. Dramatic declines in net debt have led to steep falls in interest expenses and increased financial flexibility. Margin gap relative to peers continues to narrow, will all but disappear by fiscal 2016. Price target of $29.06 may seem low, but it fails to account for optionality provided by share repurchases or further M&A. Every sector has its own recipe for growth and success. In some, it is about branding and customer service. In others, it is about pricing power. In contract manufacturing, however, it is all about scale, and leveraging operating expenses to the best of one's ability. And for one contract manufacturer, the next two years will see margins and EPS expand at a rate well above that of its peers. Despite this, said contract manufacturer is not being valued at what we believe is fair value. And that manufacturer is Sanmina (NASDAQ: SANM ). As the third largest North American contract manufacturer by revenue (behind Flextronics and Jabil Circuit), Sanmina would appear to be a prime candidate to follow the tried and true strategy of growing in the contract manufacturing space: buying up as much revenue as possible, and leveraging expenses as best as possible. However, Sanmina's management has taken a different track, one that has allowed the company to boost margins at the fastest pace among the contract manufacturers in its peer group, all while allowing the company to meaningfully deleverage its balance sheet, driving its leverage to a decade low. Sanmina's management has done a more than adequate job in strengthening Sanmina's balance sheet, increasing margins, and positioning the company to begin returning capital to shareholders at far more meaningful levels than it has in the past. However, despite this progress, shares of Sanmina remain valued at levels we believe do not reflect its true value; while EBIT and EBITDA are set to grow at levels that are only in-line with peers, Sanmina's EPS growth is well-above its peer averages as the company continues to slash interest expenses, a factor we do not believe is being recognized by the market. Using current estimates, we see upside approaching 20% for shares of Sanmina, utilizing what we believe are fairly benign assumptions. And further upside and optionality is provided by two factors: the potential for accretive tuck-in acquisitions, a cornerstone of Sanmina's recent strategy, and the potential for actual returns of capital, as opposed to the token amounts that Sanmina has returned over the past decade. Our write-up will begin with an overview of Sanmina's history, followed by an analysis of its latest financial results, a peer comparison, and an analysis of the company's financial position. Unless otherwise noted, financial statistics and managerial commentary used in this article will be sourced from the following: Sanmina's Q1 2015 10-Q , its fiscal 2014 10-K (and other annual filings), its Q1 2015 earnings release , its Q1 2015 earnings presentation , and its Q1 2015 earnings conference call . Sanmina, based in San Jose, was founded in 1980 as a manufacturer of circuit boards, and went public in 1993. The company took on its present form in 2001, with the $6 billion merger of Sanmina and SCI Systems, thereby creating Sanmina-SCI, a name that was retained until November 2012, when the company was renamed Sanmina. In its present form, Sanmina operates in two overarching business segments: Integrated Manufacturing Solutions, or IMS, and Components, Products, and Services, or CPS. The IMS segment houses Sanmina's circuit board and final assembly businesses, as well as its testing business, while the CPS segment houses the company's precision machining and molding business, its aerospace & defense unit, as well as its memory and solid-state drive division. The IMS business is by far the largest at Sanmina, accounting for ~79% of sales in fiscal 2014 (the 12 months ended September 2014), versus ~21% for the CPS business. Like many contract manufacturers, the bulk of Sanmina's sales occur overseas; the United States accounts for less than 20% of global sales, as shown below. In fiscal 2014, the U.S. accounted for ~16.8% of total sales; by contrast, Mexico, which is now Sanmina's single largest market, accounted for over 27% of total sales (Sanmina only reports geographic sales in these four segments). Sanmina's meaningful international exposure has fueled some concern about the company's foreign currency exposure. However, as we will discuss in more detail later, this is not as large of an issue as it appears to be, given the dynamics of Sanmina's global operations. Sanmina's customer base is somewhat diversified. Although the company does not name specific customers in its securities filings, it does disclose that its ten largest customers accounted for ~50% of global sales in the fiscal years 2012-2014; no customers accounted for more than 10% of sales in 2014, but did in 2013 and 2012. We note that this particular measure fluctuates from year to year, depending on the flow of orders that Sanmina receives in any given year. The bulk of Sanmina's sales are derived from communications-related sales, covering technologies such as wireless base stations, network switches, and routers. The chart below breaks down Sanmina's sales by end market. Beginning with its fiscal 2015 results, however, Sanmina reorganized its reporting of end markets, cutting the number down to three. The company's new end markets are as follows: communications, industrial, defense, and medical, and finally, embedded computing and storage. Since 2012, industrial, defense, and medical sales are growing at a far faster pace than the rest of the company, and that has certainly been the case so far this fiscal year. We turn now to our discussion of Sanmina's Q1 2015 results, which were released in late January. Sanmina's results for Q1 2015 (the three months ended December 2014) highlight a continuation of the company's newfound strategy of executing small tuck-in acquisitions to expand EBIT (and EBITDA) margins. In the table, below we present a breakdown of Sanmina's results for the quarter. Total sales in the quarter grew by over 15% to ~$1.67 billion (missing consensus by $10 million), and EPS of 61 cents grew by almost 49% year-over-year, beating consensus by three cents. Sales growth this quarter was led by the IMS business, which grew by almost 20% year-over-year, driven by continued growth in optical networking and industrial and defense sales, with benefits from several tuck-in acquisitions of customer programs in Q1 2014 and Q3 2014, which somewhat distort Sanmina's sales growth. We break down sales by end market in the table below. In Q1 2015, sales growth was led by the industrial, defense, and medical business, which grew by over 41%, well above the pace of growth seen in communications and embedded computing (into which the multimedia segment was folded into). A portion of this growth has come from Sanmina's burgeoning oil and gas business. In December 2013, Sanmina paid $57.7 million to acquire certain oil and gas manufacturing operations in order to expand its precision machining and testing services for the industry. While we note concerns over low oil prices, this acquisition is still a net positive for Sanmina, given that the company has continued to expand operating margins. With EBIT growing by over 40%, and EBITDA up by over 28%, we do not see this as cause for concern. While neither Sanmina's management nor its S.E.C. filings disclose the precise level of the company's exposure to the oil and gas market, management noted on the company's Q1 earnings call that it is "well below" 5%, thereby insulating Sanmina from the current decline in oil prices. While management has said that this is a long-term target market for the company, it is not yet a material driver of revenue, and is unlikely to be one for some time. During the quarter, book-to-bill came in at 1, with softness in communications being countered by strong growth in industrial, and automotive sales. Management also noted good growth in the company's medical and defense businesses, as well as storage. However, as a segment, CPS sales rose by just 89 basis points, as product mix moved against Sanmina, which in turn pressured gross margins as well in the segment, which fell 10 basis points year-over-year. That being said, Sanmina is forecasting a reversal in CPS gross margins in the 2nd half of the year. While Sanmina's business is cyclical to some extent, it also comes with a high degree of visibility, given the constant communication between the company and its customer base, which gives it an elevated level of confidence when forecasting performance several quarters out. Despite the slight decline in CPS gross margins, a 28 basis point improvement in IMS gross margins helped push overall gross margins up slightly to 7.93%. In communications, the issue appears to be a push-out of demand, as opposed to an actual drop in underlying demand during the quarter. CEO Jure Sola noted that the 2nd half of fiscal 2015 is set to see a recovery in the segment, driven by the continuing expansion of 4G networks, particularly in international markets, where many countries remain well behind the U.S. in their 4G network rollouts. We expect more color on communications demand when Sanmina reports Q2 2015 results in late April (assuming normal release patterns hold). In our view, the more important story at Sanmina is that of the company's expenses. Total expenses were almost flat during the quarter, rising just 27 basis point in absolute dollars, and falling by over 13% as a percent of sales to 3.84%. As a result, EBIT increased by over 40%, with EBITDA rising by over 28% as Sanmina continues to hold down costs and leverage its expenses. As with many other contact manufacturers, this is the core of Sanmina's business model. Sanmina saw solid expense leverage in both SG&A and R&D; SG&A as a percent of sales fell by more than 13% year-over-year, and R&D fell by almost 12%. And Sanmina's guidance for Q2 2015 (and implicitly, H1 2015 as well) implies a continuation of this trend. We break down Sanmina's guidance in the table below (note: all guidance for Q2 2015 is presented at the midpoint of Sanmina's guidance range). For Q2 2015, Sanmina is guiding for revenues of $1.6 billion (within a range of $1.575-$1.625 billion) and EPS of $0.52 (within a range of $0.50-$0.55; we rounded down for the sake of conservatism), which mostly matched consensus estimates that called for revenue of $1.61 billion and EPS of $0.53. While Sanmina is set to see further contraction in its gross margin as a result of continued gross margin softness at the CPS business, this will be more than made up for by continued leverage in operating expenses. Total operating expenses are projected to come in at a midpoint of $66 million, down ~2.6% year-over-year in dollar terms, and down more than 10% as a percent of sales. In total, this will lead to implied EBIT of $60.4 million, up over 13% year-over-year (Sanmina does not explicitly guide to EBIT, but the measure can be calculated from the other components of Sanmina's guidance). We believe that the vagaries of Sanmina's business mean that it is also important to look at the first half of the fiscal year as a whole, rather than each quarter in isolation, as the flow of demand can shift significantly from quarter to quarter due to issues of timing, rather than specific demand issues. For the first half of fiscal 2015, Sanmina is calling for revenue growth of almost 12%, but EBIT growth of over 26%, a function of continued expense discipline. While consolidated gross margin is set to decline by 8 basis points, we believe it is more than made up for by rising EBIT margins, and management has guided for a recovery in CPS margins in the second half of the year as product mix returns to more favorable levels. We expect more color on this in April, and expect Q3 2015 guidance to reflect such a recovery. We note that gross margins are also likely to benefit from a decline in input costs for Sanmina, given favorable commodity pricing, due in part to a strong dollar. This, however, has fed concerns over Sanmina's overall performance, given that less than 17% of its sales were generated in the U.S. in fiscal 2014, and the impact it has on the company's revenue. However, Sanmina's global nature allows for it to counter this issue in several ways. We turn now to a discussion of Sanmina's exposure to foreign currencies. On paper, Sanmina seems like a prime candidate to be weakened by the dollar's recent rally. Over 80% of sales are generated outside of the United States, and the company's single largest market is Mexico, accounting for more than a quarter of sales. However, there is much more to this than meets the eye. As disclosed in its 10-K filings, Sanmina's geographic revenue breakdown is not based on customer location. As the company states, this information is based on "the country in which a product is manufactured or a service is provided." While Sanmina may manufacture products in Mexico, this does not mean that the company was paid to do so in pesos. Sanmina's disclosure regarding revenue by geography (which is mirrored by peer Flextronics (NASDAQ: FLEX ) in its own 10-K filings) is simply based on where a product happens to be manufactured. If, for example, a U.S. based provider of routers wishes for Sanmina to manufacture them, said manufacturing may take place in any number of countries, such as Mexico or China, even if the order to carry it out is settled in dollars. To date, Sanmina's management has made no mention of currency acting as a headwind for the company. In fact, we see the strong dollar as a tailwind for the company, in light of its global nature. While Sanmina may be based in San Jose (and incorporated in Delaware), most of its manufacturing takes place outside of the United States. We break down Sanmina's manufacturing capacity by country in the table below, as of the end of fiscal 2014 (Sanmina does not disclose manufacturing capacity on a quarterly basis). Less than a quarter of Sanmina's manufacturing capacity takes place in the United States; the plurality of its capacity is in China (Mexico comes in third with almost 21% of total capacity). In our view, a large part of Sanmina's manufacturing costs are therefore denominated in various foreign currencies; if a factory is located in Mexico, it is logical to assume the costs of running said factory are denominated in pesos (ranging from costs such as electricity, fuel, and the salaries of factory employees). If the dollar continues to rise, we believe that this will help create a tailwind for gross margins in coming quarters, given the fact that these local currency expenses are translated back into dollars as part of the preparation of Sanmina's financial statements. While Sanmina does not disclose the geographic breakdown of its ~43,000 employees (as of the end of fiscal 2014), we would imagine that a large portion of the company's global headcount is devoted to manufacturing. In our view, Sanmina is fairly well-insulated from foreign currency risks; while its business is indeed global in nature, the nuances of contract manufacturing are such that Sanmina does not face the same risks related to foreign currency exposure as do other companies that have a majority of their sales derived from international markets. At first glance, Sanmina's upside from current levels, when calculated based on the multiples of it and its peers, does not appear to be highly meaningful. However, we do not believe that it takes into account the optionality provided by both further accretive M&A and returns of capital (more on those to follow later). Below, we present a comparison of Sanmina in relation to its peer group, which we define as the following: Flextronics, Benchmark (NYSE: BHE ), Celestica (NYSE: CLS ), Jabil Circuit (NYSE: JBL ), and Plexus (NASDAQ: PLXS ). Notes: 2) Forward multiples are based on each company's closing price as of March 24, 2015, and are subject to change. 3) Figures for fiscal 2015-2016 growth averaged exclude Jabil Circuit, which experienced a substantial decline in revenue, EBIT/EBITDA, and EPS in fiscal 2014, which distorts growth rates. We wish to highlight several points here. First, Sanmina's sales growth between fiscal 2014 and 2016 is currently estimated to come in at 8.7%, higher than its peer average of 7.4% (again excluding Jabil Circuit). And while EBITDA and EBIT are set to grow at a slightly slower pace than its peer group, Sanmina stands out on two other metrics: EBITDA margin growth and EPS growth, two points we now turn to. Sanmina is making meaningful strides in closing the margin gap between it and its peers. In fiscal 2013, Sanmina posted an EBITDA margin of 3.42%, a gap of more than 36% relative to the peer average of 5.39%. But, by fiscal 2016, Sanmina's EBITDA margins are estimated to rise to 5.64%, an increase of over 64%, far exceeding the average 7.33% expansion in peer EBITDA margins, thereby bringing the gap between Sanmina and its peers down to less than 2.1%. However, while Sanmina has made large strides in closing the margin gap between it and its peers, the real profit growth is occurring at the bottom of its income statement, as evidenced by the differential in growth between Sanmina and its peers in terms of EPS. In the table below, we break down the differentials in growth between Sanmina and its peers. Sanmina's EPS growth between fiscal 2015 and 2016 is set to come in at almost 25%, well above the growth of its peer group, which is set to come in at under 16%. This is primarily a result of the dramatic improvements in Sanmina's capital structure that have taken place in recent years, resulting in a dramatic fall in both leverage and interest expense. For much of the past decade, Sanmina's balance sheet has been bloated with debt, leading to sizeable interest expenses that have pressured EPS. However, by fiscal 2014, the picture had changed dramatically. In the tables below, we present a breakdown of Sanmina's net debt, leverage (defined here as debt-to-equity) and interest expenses over the past decade. Sanmina ended fiscal 2014 with net debt of less than $78 million, and a net debt-to-equity ratio of just 6.21% (net debt rose to ~$99.1 million in Q1 2015). As management noted on Sanmina's Q1 2015 earnings call, Sanmina's capital structure is the best it has been in the last thirteen years, a testament to management's commitment to deleveraging the company's balance sheet. This sustained deleveraging has led to a meaningful decline in Sanmina's interest expenses, which we break down below. In fiscal 2014, interest expenses at Sanmina totaled just $30.804 million, a reduction of more than 50% in just two years, and a reduction of almost 82% versus their peak in fiscal 2007. And in Q1 2015, interest expenses totaled $6.437 million, a reduction of ~13.9% versus a year ago. Sanmina ended Q1 2015 with over $391 million in cash & investments, and debt of ~$490.3 million. Of this, ~$63.4 million is due within the next 12 months, and the remainder is due in the following order: $40 million is due in December 2017, $375 million is due in 2019, with the remainder also due in 2019 (consisting of less than $15 million in non-interest bearing notes). Sanmina's EPS has been boosted in recent years by the company's aggressive moves to strengthen its balance sheet; as the table above notes, EBIT grew by more than 25% in fiscal 2014, a respectable level of growth. But EPS grew by more than 38%, due in large part to Sanmina's continued push to deleverage and lower interest expenses. As a result of this, we believe that it is best to value Sanmina on a blend of EV/EBITDA, EV/EBIT, and P/E multiples, given that this incorporates the growth of both Sanmina's underlying business profits, as well as its net income, which takes into account the dramatic and ongoing reduction in Sanmina's interest expenses. Our valuation of Sanmina relies on peer multiples, adjusted for the differentials in growth between Sanmina and its peers; our philosophy here, as outlined in previous write-ups, has been that companies should be rewarded by the market for superior growth prospects, and penalized for subpar growth, something that we take into account in valuing Sanmina; target multiples have been assigned a discount or premium based on the differential in growth between Sanmina and its peers, as described above. We break down our valuation of Sanmina in the table below. Taking the average of these six measures yields a pro forma price target of $29.06, representing upside of 15.7% relative to Sanmina's March 24 closing price of $25.12. On the surface, this does not appear to be a highly material return. But, Sanmina has two key levers to pull that can serve to meaningfully increase the potential upside available to shareholder, levers that are not captured in either our price target or current consensus estimates. There are two paths for Sanmina to deliver upside beyond our price target, and both involve deploying capital to create shareholder value: returning capital to shareholders and continued acquisitions. We begin our analysis with returning capital to shareholders. Historically, Sanmina has not been known for its capital return practices. Sanmina does not pay a dividend (and has never done so), and its share repurchase activity leaves much to be desired. In the table below, we break down Sanmina's cash flows and share repurchases over the past decade. Over the past ten fiscal years, Sanmina has produced a cumulative $892.933 million in free cash flow. And of that, just over $108 million has been deployed on buying back shares, and more than $76 million of that (or over 70%) occurred in 2014. Over the past decade, Sanmina has returned just 12.1% of its free cash flow to shareholders. Not 12.1% per year, but 12.1% in total. Absent fiscal 2014, Sanmina returned an average of 2.51% of free cash flow per year to shareholders in the fiscal years 2005-2013, hardly an amount that can add much in the way of shareholder value. While Sanmina does have a share repurchase program in place, its utilization has been limited in relation to both Sanmina's size and newfound capacity to repurchase stock. In March 2013, Sanmina announced an open-ended program to buy back $100 million in stock. And in September 2014, Sanmina announced a second $100 million buyback program. However, this program will take effect only when the previous 2013 program expires. As of the end of Q1 2015, $25 million remains in authorization under the 2013 program. And during Q1 2015, Sanmina made no purchases of shares on the open market; the company's ~$1.2 million in repurchase activity was tied to settling employee tax withholding obligations on vesting restricted stock units. On the company's Q1 earnings call, analysts pressed Sanmina about its capital structure, in an attempt to ascertain when the company would shift from debt reduction and deleveraging to returning capital to shareholders. Christian Schwab, of Craig-Hallum, for example, stated that, In line with the earlier question asked by someone else, I would reiterate that I think a top priority for you should be repurchasing stock at current levels, for whatever it's worth. Sanmina's management team noted that they are examining a resumption of share buybacks, and with net debt now under $100 million, we believe that the potential for a ramp up in Sanmina's repurchase activity will occur this year. Management hinted that it is examining "opportunities to repurchase equity," and we believe that fiscal 2015 will see, at a minimum, a gradual realignment in management's thinking regarding capital deployment as Sanmina continues to add cash to its balance sheet and deleverage. The second path to upside beyond our stated price target is the potential for further small, tuck-in acquisitions. As CFO Bob Eulau stated, We want to find profitable growth opportunities Again, it [M&A deals] will be of the nature you've seen from us in the past, smaller and something that's very synergistic with what we've been articulating as our strategy for many years. So we'll continue to look at M&A, and we look at a lot of deals every year. We don't pull the trigger that often, but we'll continue to, I'm sure, do some deals going forward. Sanmina has built a track record of being able to find and close small, but accretive deals, and we fully expect this trend to continue. Given Sanmina's focus on such deals, it is difficult to account for them in forward estimates, and we believe that further M&A activity will translate into additional upside as Sanmina continue to execute on its goal of not only growing revenue, but expanding margins as well. In our view, Sanmina is an attractive investment at current levels. Management has executed well in shepherding the company through the economic recovery; the margin gap between Sanmina and its peers continues to narrow, and is set to all but disappear by the end of fiscal 2016. Sanmina's balance sheet has been meaningfully deleveraged; net debt is now below $100 million, and the balance sheet is in its best shape in at least a decade. Interest expenses have fallen by more than 80% from their peak, driving meaningful earnings growth for the company, and they continue to fall. While our price target for Sanmina may not appear to imply meaningful upside, we believe that it does not fully capture the optionality that Sanmina's newfound financial flexibility provides. Both further M&A activity and share repurchases present upside to our price target, and we believe that in fiscal 2015, management's focus will turn to these two paths. With the company's deleveraging all but complete, Sanmina is now in a position to deploy its capital in ways that can create value for shareholders, as opposed to simply working to ease the stress on the company's balance sheet. And as Sanmina pivots from deleveraging to returning capital, we believe that shareholders will benefit in a meaningful way.
