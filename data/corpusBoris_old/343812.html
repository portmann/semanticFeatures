That doesnâ€™t mean it ought to be taboo, Greg Ip says. With fiscal and monetary policy reaching their limits, the search for new solutions to the worldâ€™s low-growth, low inflation rut has turned to â€œhelicopter money.â€? The policy gets its name from an essay by Milton Friedman in 1969 that imagined newly printed money dropped from helicopters. While it evokes images of Weimar Germany and hyperinflation, itâ€™s actually not that exotic or, for the U.S., unprecedented. Itâ€™s a logical option for any country struggling with deflation and slow growth, as Japan has and perhaps other countries some day may. Peter Praet, the European Central Bankâ€™s chief economist, recently noted , â€œAll central banks can do it. The question is, if and when is it opportune.â€? Richard Clarida, a Columbia University economist, predicts: â€œWe will see a variant of helicopter money (perhaps thinly disguised) in the next 10 years if not the next five.â€? â€œHelicopter moneyâ€? came from economist Milton Friedmanâ€™s 1969 essay, â€œThe Optimum Quantity Of Money.â€? Photo: KEYSTONE/GETTY IMAGES Mr. Friedman used the helicopter as a metaphor to argue that the government could always create inflation by printing enough money. As people spent the money, nominal gross domestic product would riseâ€”either through the production of more goods and services, higher prices or both. Havenâ€™t central banks been doing that, through quantitative easing, known as QE? No. Helicopter moneyâ€”which, in its more practical forms, is called monetary finance, or monetizing the debtâ€”is used to purchase goods and services. With QE, the newly created money is used to buy government bonds. This pushes down bond yields, which should make consumers borrow and spend moreâ€”as interest rate cuts do in normal times. But that may not work, if people are so risk-averse they are willing to hold Treasury bills or cash with no return whatsoever rather than spend. Helicopter money is also different from traditional fiscal stimulus. Then, the government sells bonds to the public and uses the proceeds to directly stimulate demand, for example by building highways, hiring teachers or cutting taxes. But eventually more government borrowing will push up interest rates, hurting private investment and raising solvency worries. Households, expecting their taxes to rise, may spend less (a phenomenon dubbed Ricardian equivalence). Helicopter money merges QE and fiscal policy while, in theory, getting around limitations on both. The government issues bonds to the central bank, which pays for them with newly created money. The government uses that money to invest, hire,Â send people checks or cut taxes, virtually guaranteeing that total spending will go up. Because the Fed, not the public, is buying the bonds, private investment isnâ€™t crowded out. Unlike with QE, the Fed promises never to sell the bonds or withdraw from circulation the money it created. It returns the interest earned on the bonds to the government. That means households wonâ€™t expect their taxes to go up to repay the bonds. It also means they should expect prices eventually to rise. As spending and prices rise, nominal GDP goes up, so the debt-to-GDP ratio can remain stable. If this sounds too good to be true, itâ€™s because usually it is. Throughout history, governments that couldnâ€™t or wouldnâ€™t collect enough taxes to finance their spending resorted to the printing press, from the U.S. Confederacy in the 1860s to Zimbabwe in the 1990s. Itâ€™s why so many central banks, including the ECB, are prohibited from financing government deficits. But just because monetizing the debt can cause hyperinflation doesnâ€™t mean it must. In ordinary times, the Fed is continuously monetizing debt to create enough currency to lubricate the wheels of commerce. Between 1997 and 2007, before QE began, its holdings of government debt rose by $355 billion, and currency in circulation rose by a similar amount. In effect, the government borrowed and spent $355 billion and never has to repay it. In that instance, the Fed only created as much currency as the public wanted. What if it created more, to finance government spending? Even that isnâ€™t necessarily catastrophic. In his book “ Between Debt and the Devil ,” which advocates helicopter money, the British economist Adair Turner cites Pennsylvania in the early 1700s, the U.S. Union government in the 1860s and Japan in the early 1930s as examples of governments that used monetary finance without triggering hyperinflation. An even better example is World War II. The federal government had to borrow heavily to finance the war effort and the Fed helped by buying bonds to keep their yields from rising above 2.5%. Between 1940 and 1945, the Fedâ€™s holdings of debt rose from $2.5 billion to $22 billion, an increase roughly equal to 9% of annual GDP. Though this only financed a fraction of the war, it was still debt monetization: most of those purchases proved to be permanent. The war effort massively boosted nominal GDP. Initially, only part of that showed up as higher prices, thanks to wage and price controls. Most of it came through a stunning rise in real output, made possible by the economyâ€™s depressed prewar state, a flood of women into the labor force and business innovation to meet the demands of war and the civilian economy. As wage and price controls ended, prices shot up 34% between 1945 and 1948. But then, inflation reverted to low single digits. Today, governments are trying to get inflation higher, not lower. But QE and deficit spending to date have yet to accomplish that. Would helicopter money? Mr. Clarida, who is also an adviser to bond manager Pacific Investment Management Co., says to have the desired effect central banks and governments must coordinate at the outset. Rather than commit, as the Fed has done, to eventually get rid of its bonds, it must promise to hold them forever. â€œIf markets expect the new debt to be sold into the market in the future, that would depress consumption as households and firms expect a future tax increase.â€? Moreover, he notes, the Fed must not pay interest on the reserves it creates when it buys the debt, as that would negate the fiscal benefits. The main concern with monetary finance is that inflation is an arbitrary tax on holders of cash and bonds. If politicians get used to the printing press, they could let inflation rip, destroying the wealth of many households. Mr. Turner says, â€œ There is no technical reason money finance should produce excessive inflation .â€? The government could require banks to hold more of the newly created cash as reservesÂ at the Fed. By limiting how much banks can lend, the government would limit how fast nominal GDP would rise. Another obstacleÂ is the institutional separation between monetary and fiscal policy. That separation exists for a good reason: Central banks were granted independence so that they would not become the printing press for feckless politicians. The Fed was uncomfortableÂ doing the Treasuryâ€™s bidding during World War II and dates its de facto independence to the end of the arrangement in 1951. In 2013, Treasury was advised to sell the Fed a platinum coin to get around the statutory debt ceiling. Treasury dismissed the idea as a dangerous violation of Fed independence. Tampering with this long-standing separation should not be done lightly. For the U.S., which is at close to full employment and in no imminent danger of deflation, the tradeoff hardly seems worthwhile. But there may be times, and countries, when it is. Monetary finance isnâ€™t riskless, Mr. TurnerÂ says, but the alternatives may be worse: stagnation and deflation, or perpetually low interest rates that fuel dangerous bubbles: â€œThe money finance option should not be excluded as taboo.â€? Moneybeat: Gold And Helicopters: A Marriage Made in Heaven? (March 10) Greg Ip: Could Higher Interest Rates Lead to Higher Inflation? Explaining â€˜Neo-Fisherismâ€™ (Dec. 8, 2015) "Helicopter money merges QE and fiscal policy while, in theory, getting around limitations on both. The government issues bonds to the central bank, which pays for them with newly created money. The government uses that money to invest, hire,Â send people checks or cut taxes, virtually guaranteeing that total spending will go up." How does the government "invest" money? In companies like Solyndra? It can "hire" more bureaucrats to harass you and me. "Send people checks"? Oh yea. A lot of good that does. #1 The U.S. government is spending $750,000 on a new soccer field for detainees held at Guantanamo Bay. #2 The Obama administration plans to spend between 16 and 20 million dollars helping students from Indonesia get masterâ€™s degrees. #3 If you can believe it, the U.S. government has spent $175,587 â€œto determine if cocaine makes Japanese quail engage in sexually risky behaviorâ€?. #4 The U.S. government spent $200,000 on â€œa tattoo removal programâ€? in Mission Hills, California. #5 The federal government has shelled out $3 million to researchers at the University of California at Irvine to fund their research on video games such as World of Warcraft.Â  Wouldnâ€™t we all love to have a â€œresearch jobâ€? like that? #6 The Department of Health and Human Services plans to spend $500 million on a program that will, among other things, seek to solve the problem of 5-year-old children that â€œcanâ€™t sit stillâ€? in a kindergarten classroom. #7 Fannie Mae is about to ask the federal government for another $4.6 billion bailout , and it will almost certainly get it. #8 The federal government once spent 30 million dollars on a program that was designed to help Pakistani farmers produce more mangos. #9 The U.S. Department of Agriculture once gave researchers at the University of New Hampshire $700,000 to study methane gas emissions from dairy cows. How about a lottery: Â  IRS gives away $100MM on April 20 of each year.Â Â $1MM to one natural person from each state drawn randomly from those who timely file their income tax return; and $1MM to 50 individuals, drawn from the pool of all taxpayers who timely file their income tax returns, nationwide.Â Â  It would be nice to give some recognition to those who carry the weight, and file timely.Â  And, a bit less regressive than the current policy of limiting cash giveaways to the Banks.Â Â  This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only.
