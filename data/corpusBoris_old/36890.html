New Oriental: Growth Back On Track - New Oriental Education & Technology Group Inc. (NYSE:EDU) | Seeking Alpha New Oriental reported fiscal Q3 2015 earnings and revenue ahead of analyst estimates. Growth is back on track as the revamp of POP kids segment is done and as the number of learning centers expands. Margins to remain under pressure in fiscal Q4, but should trend higher in fiscal 2016. New Oriental (NYSE: EDU ) reported fiscal Q3 2015 earnings and revenue above of views. The company also guided fiscal Q4 revenue ahead of analyst estimates. Margins remain under pressure as the company continues to invest in its online and O2O initiatives, but they are on track to expand in fiscal 2016 as the online and O2O spending should be lower while the higher revenue base next year should lead to higher operating leverage. Since the growth is back on track and as the online and O2O initiatives ramp up, further P/E expansion is realistic and might lead to more upside than I anticipated in my previous article. New Oriental's fiscal Q3 2015 revenue increased 13.1% to $287.7 million, which was $2.95 million ahead of the analyst consensus which was right at the mid-point of management guidance. Non-GAAP EPS decreased 2.9% to $0.29, which was $0.07 ahead of views. Enrollments were flat Y/Y due to the timing of the Chinese New Year, and management said on the conference call that the normalized enrollment growth rate (if we add the six weeks of the fiscal Q4) was around 9.5%. All product categories have delivered solid top-line growth, and the most notable improvement is the revamped POP Kids program, which finally turned around and posted gross revenue growth of approximately 7% and enrollment growth of 16%. In the first six weeks of fiscal Q4, the POP Kids segment reported over 30% enrollment growth and the company will continue to roll out the program in the fourth quarter and expects a significant pick up in both revenue and enrollment growth in the following quarters. Margins to remain under pressure in fiscal Q4 but should start expanding in fiscal 2016 The company has managed to better control the costs in fiscal Q3 and the non-GAAP EPS has declined less than expected. We should expect continued margin pressure in fiscal Q4 as the company continues to invest in the online and O2O initiatives, but margins should start trending higher in fiscal 2016. Management pointed out on the fiscal Q3 conference call that the online and O2O spending will be lower in fiscal 2016 and the higher revenue base should lead to higher margins. The number of learning centers should also continue to increase going forward as the company maintains its strategy of steady top and bottom line growth, while the investments in the online and O2O should start delivering more meaningful results in the following years. The contribution of the online segment in fiscal Q3 was around 5% and the segment should reach high single digit or low double digit top line contribution in two to three years. The renewed margin expansion in fiscal 2016 makes further P/E expansion more likely. The market seems to be discounting this already since the P/E ratio is expanding despite EPS declines in the last couple of quarters. Looking at the historical non-GAAP P/E ratio trends in the last couple of years and the expected EPS growth for fiscal 2016, New Oriental's TTM P/E ratio has a good chance of reaching 25 or 30 in the next 12 to 18 months as margins recover and as earnings start rising once again. If we take the current fiscal 2016 consensus and the P/E ratio range of 25 to 30, we get a price target range between $37 and $44, which translates into 45% to 76% upside from the current price. The conservative scenario is for the P/E ratio to remain around 20, which translates into a $29 price target. Either way, I still believe that there is more upside left and remain positive on New Oriental in the medium term. Source: New Oriental earnings reports , Yahoo! Finance The downside risks should be limited as the company's growth is back on track, and I would not expect New Oriental to trade at less than 15x its TTM EPS, which translates into 20% downside from the current price. The main risk to the thesis is the increasing competition and the potential disruption of new players in the online education space (YY for example). The other risk is continued margin pressure, which should lead P/E contraction rather than expansion, and I think that New Oriental would revisit or slightly undercut the lows achieved in early 2015 in that case. New Oriental's growth is back on track and it remains a solid stock to own as the renewed margin expansion in fiscal 2016 should lead to further P/E expansion in the next 12 to 18 months. The potential upside is at least 15% in the conservative scenario (if the P/E ratio remains at current levels) while the upside in the more bullish case would be between 45% and 76%. This compares to the expected maximum downside of 20% and gives investors an asymmetric reward/risk ratio on top of the 30% gain since my bullish call in August 2014 . The $1.1 billion in cash and equivalents (approximately 27% of the current market cap) should help protect the downside and if the shares fall from here, the company may initiate another buyback program since the previous buyback program ended on March 31.
