Learn more about PRO » I am projecting FSFR will report a minor decrease in NAV but generate a minor economic return during the fiscal third quarter of 2015. I am also projecting FSFR will report a modest â€“ material increase in NII when compared to the prior quarter. FSFR recently began funding FSFR Glick JV which allows the company to continue to expand its investment portfolio. FSFR expects a low-teens return on this specific investment vehicle. FSFR also recently announced a refinancing of its credit facility with Natixis through the closing of a debt securitization which locks in attractive borrowing costs through 2024. Even though I am projecting a minor decrease in NAV, I believe FSFR continues to be attractively priced at an excessively material discount to NAV. Author's Note: This article provides a detailed analysis with supporting documentation on Fifth Street Senior Floating Rate Corp.'s (NASDAQ: FSFR ) projected net asset value ("NAV") per share as of 6/30/2015. I perform this detailed analysis for readers who anticipate/want such an analysis performed each quarter. For readers who just want the summarized conclusions/results of the NAV projection analysis, I would suggest to scroll down to the "Conclusions Drawn" section near the bottom of the article. The focus of this article is to provide a detailed projection of FSFR's NAV per share as of 6/30/2015. Prior to results being provided to the public after markets close on 8/10/2015 (via the company's quarterly press release), I would like to analyze FSFR's NAV as of 6/30/2015 and provide readers a general direction on how I believe this recent quarter has panned out. I will also include my quarterly "net investment income" ("NII") and "net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations" (also known as "earnings per share" ("EPS")) projections in this article. Before we begin the company's NAV projection analysis, I wanted to provide readers my current thoughts in regards to FSFR as a possible equity investment. This should help some readers better understand what is currently occurring within FSFR regarding several key metrics and also assist when reading the NAV projection analysis. My current BUY, SELL, or HOLD recommendation for FSFR will be at the bottom of this section of the article. Currently, I believe there are six reasons why FSFR is an attractive equity investment. However, to remain prudent, I also believe there is one "cautionary" factor which would likely "steer" less risk tolerant investors away from currently owning FSFR as a possible equity investment. Let us first discuss the positive factors. First, FSFR trades at an excessively material discount to my projected NAV as of 6/30/2015 (per share figure provided near the end of the article). As of 8/5/2015, FSFR's stock price was $9.10 per share. This calculates to a discount of ($3.28) per share for a price to NAV ratio of 0.7349 (a 26.51% discount). FSFR's discount to NAV has modestly increased over the past several months. I believe most investors should see this excessively material discount to NAV as an attractive opportunity to own FSFR. Second, even though FSFR had an annual forward yield to the company's NAV as of 3/31/2015 of 9.63%., the company had an annual forward yield to its stock price as of 8/5/2015 of 13.19%. I believe this current yield, which is currently in excess of 12.5%, is another positive factor of owning FSFR. Third, FSFR announced several quarters ago it had formed a joint venture ("JV") partnership with members of the Glick Family (GF Funding) to expand the company's investment portfolio. This newly created JV partnership is called "FSFR Glick Family JV LLC" (FSFR Glick JV) and was formed during the fiscal first quarter of 2015. FSFR has continued to state the company expects to generate an annual return in the low teens in regards to this recently formed JV partnership. When fully funded, FSFR Glick JV is expected to generate annual returns approximately 500 basis points ("bps") above FSFR's average return on investment ("ROI"). This is due to the fact management fees are based on the net assets of FSFR Glick JV (not gross assets) which is one strategic advantage. In addition, by utilizing JV partnerships, FSFR can "circumvent" the business development company ("BDC") debt-to-equity leverage ratio threshold of 1.0x while still maintaining the company's Regulated Investment Company ("RIC") status per the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC"). Both parties have committed to provide a combined $100 million of debt and equity to this recently created entity. FSFR will provide $87.5 million and GF Funding will provide the remaining $12.5 million. During the fiscal second quarter of 2015, FSFR was in discussions with several lenders regarding debt financing for FSFR Glick JV. By the end of April 2015, $86.6 million of funding has been provided to invest in a portfolio of senior secured loans. This funding has been provided through equity of $60 million, in accordance with the proportional percentages discussed above, and through FSFR Glick JV's recently secured $200 million revolving credit facility with Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands (Credit Suisse). When calculated, management anticipates FSFR Glick JV will have an investment capacity of approximately $300 million. Even though FSFR Glick JV was not fully "ramped up" during the fiscal third quarter of 2015, the benefits of this type of investment structure should begin to have a more material impact towards the latter-half of 2015/early 2016. Management has also stated FSFR will likely have future discussions with other interested third parties to create additional JV partnerships over the next several years. I believe the strategic advantages of these types of JV partnerships should be seen as a positive factor. Fourth, FSFR has recently continued to expand the company's available borrowings. In January 2015, management announced FSFR had closed a $175 million revolving credit facility with Citibank, N.A. (Citi). The Citi Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility is priced at LIBOR plus 2% - 2.25%. I believe this new revolving credit facility is attractively priced and will allow FSFR to continue to expand the company's investment portfolio over the foreseeable future. Furthermore, in June 2015 management announced FSFR had refinanced the company's previously amended $200 million Natixis/Fifth Third Bank Revolving Credit Facility/Term Loans by closing a $309 million "debt securitization" transaction where FSFR issued $223 million of long-term notes which are secured by the company's underlying portfolio investments. These long-term notes are termed the "2015 Notes" and have five different "classes". The weighted average interest rate associated with the five classes of 2015 Notes is LIBOR plus 2.01% which is basically unchanged when compared to the weighted average of the existing $200 million Natixis/Fifth Third Bank Revolving Credit Facility/Term Loans. Another important note is the debt securitization has a four-year reinvestment period, a two-year non-call period, and a ten-year maturity. As such, FSFR has extended the maturity of a material portion of the company's borrowings at very attractive debt financing rates. Even though an increase in LIBOR will cause an increase to FSFR's cost of funds rate, the company has nearly 100% of its investment portfolio is senior secured, floating-rate debt investments. As such, any increase in interest expense will directly be met by an increase in interest income. In all likelihood, net interest spreads will increase as the "base rate" on all new lower middle market ("LMM") and middle market ("MM") loans will be at a higher stated rate in a rising interest rate environment. Fifth, management has continued to reiterate FSFR does not anticipate issuing shares of common stock below CURRENT NAV for the foreseeable future. Even though I have stated I was against the August 2014 equity offering (due to the fact it was materially dilutive to existing shareholders; at the time I did not own the stock), I am comforted management will not perform any further dilutive actions for the foreseeable future. I believe this notion has been solidified from the recent expansion of FSFR's available debt financing which was discussed earlier. As such, I believe FSFR not performing any dilutive equity offerings for the foreseeable future is another positive factor that should be reflected in valuations. Finally, the material decrease in the price of oil during FSFR's fiscal first quarter of 2015 (and most recently during July 2015) has caused "distress"/speculation to surround most of the oil and gas sector (including parts of the energy sector) regarding falling margins and potential struggling/bankrupt entities. While I would agree markets should have some sort of generalized "cause for concern" within the high-yield debt market, I also believe one needs to "drill down" to each BDC's debt and equity investments to see which portfolio companies could be affected by this event. As of 12/31/2014, only 0.775% of FSFR's portfolio had debt and equity investments within the oil and gas sector (including certain investments in the energy sector which had "oil and gas" characteristics). As of 3/31/2015, only 0.771% of FSFR's portfolio had debt and equity investments within the oil and gas sector. When compared to the ten other BDC peers I currently cover, this was one of the lowest percentages at potential risk for investment depreciation due to falling crude oil prices. As of 3/31/2015, I calculated Apollo Investment Corp. (NASDAQ: AINV ), Main Street Capital Corp. (NYSE: MAIN ), Medley Capital Corp. (NYSE: MCC ), and Prospect Capital Corp. (NASDAQ: PSEC ) had a 15.29%, 5.88%, 6.41%, and 4.74% exposure to the oil and gas sector, respectively (again, including certain investments in the energy sector which had "oil and gas" characteristics). I believe FSFR's continued extremely low exposure to the oil and gas sector (percentage wise) should be seen as a positive sign. Now let us discuss one "cautionary" factor. The one "cautionary" factor which I believe should be discussed is FSFR's dividend. Currently, FSFR has declared monthly dividends of $0.10 per share through August 2015. For the fiscal first quarter of 2015 (quarter ending 12/31/2014), FSFR reported NII of $0.35 per share. With that being said, for the fiscal second quarter of 2015 (quarter ending 3/31/2015), FSFR reported NII of only $0.23 per share. FSFR's net investment company taxable income ("ICTI") for these two quarters was fairly similar to the company's NII. As will be discussed in the analysis below, I am projecting FSFR will report NII of $0.27 per share for the fiscal third quarter of 2015 (quarter ending 6/30/2015). While this would be a nice "bounce back" from the prior quarter, this NII projection would still be slightly - modestly below FSFR's current quarterly dividend distributions rate of $0.30 per share. Depending on one's risk tolerance and time horizon, more cautious investors may want to wait until FSFR declares the next set of monthly dividends before initiating a position in this stock. With that being said, I believe a portion of FSFR's excessively material discount to NAV has already built in the possible minor - modest dividend reduction which could occur as early as September 2015. With that being said, this "potential future event" could still cause some modest short-term volatility. Even with a possible minor - modest dividend reduction, I believe FSFR is an attractive long-term equity investment. My BUY, SELL, or HOLD Recommendation: From the analysis provided above, including additional factors not analyzed within this article, I currently rate FSFR as a HOLD when I believe the company's stock price is trading at a material (at or greater than 10% but less than 15%) discount to NAV as of 6/30/2015 and a BUY when trading at an excessively material (at or greater than 15%) discount to NAV as of 6/30/2015. As such, I currently rate FSFR as a BUY. It should be noted this recommendation is based on a "long-term" time horizon (an outlook of at least one year). For "short-term" investors (an outlook of under one year), I anticipate continued volatility in markets due to speculation surrounding the timing of the Federal Open Market Committee's ("FOMC") initial increase to the Fed Funds Rate and recent global macroeconomic events. Each investor's BUY, SELL, or HOLD decision is based on one's risk tolerance, time horizon, and dividend income goals. My personal recommendation will not fit each investor's current investing strategy. Overview of FSFR's Projected NAV as of 6/30/2015: Due to the fact that several figures needed to project/calculate FSFR's NAV as of 6/30/2015 come directly from the company's consolidated statement of operations, I provide Table 1 below. Table 1 shows FSFR's consolidated statement of operations from a nine-months ended timeframe. Using Table 1 below as a reference, one must add certain account figures from the fiscal first, second, and third quarters of 2015 for purposes of projecting a suitable NAV as of 6/30/2015. (Source: Table created entirely by myself, including all calculated figures and projected valuations) Having provided Table 1 above (in particular FSFR's "Fiscal Nine-Months Ended (ESTIMATE)" column), we can now begin to calculate FSFR's projected NAV as of 6/30/2015. This projection will be calculated using Table 2 below. (Source: Table created entirely by myself, including all calculated figures and projected valuations; some referenced figures may not "foot" due to rounding) Using Table 2 above as a reference, let us take a look at the calculation for FSFR's projected NAV as of 6/30/2015. Unless otherwise noted, all figures below are for the "nine-months ended" timeframe. Let us look at the following figures (in corresponding order to the "Ref." column shown in Table 2 next to the June 30, 2015 column): Side Note: Predicting certain accounting figures within the BDC sector is usually more difficult when compared to other sectors due to the fair market value ("FMV") adjustments that occur on a company's investment portfolio each quarter. Specifically, the following two FSFR accounts are typically more difficult to project in any given quarter: 1) unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments; and 2) realized gain (loss) on investments. As such, there are several assumptions used when performing such an analysis. FSFR's actual reported values may differ materially from my projected values within this article due to unforeseen circumstances. This could occur because management deviates from a company's prior business strategy and pursues a new strategy that was not previously disclosed or anticipated. This could also occur when the company has a "one-time" extraordinary event which was previously unforeseen. Readers should be aware as such. All projections within this article are my personal estimates and should not solely be used for any investor's buying or selling decisions. All actual reported figures that are above my ranges within this article will be deemed a positive sign in my judgment. All actual reported figures that are below my ranges within this article will be deemed a negative sign in my judgment. - Confidence Within Range = Moderate to High - See Red Reference "A" in Table 2 Above Next to the June 30, 2015 Column This "net increase (decrease) in net assets from operations" figure consists of the following three amounts that come directly from FSFR's consolidated statement of operations: 1) net investment income (see blue reference "A" in Tables 1 and 2 above); 2) net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments (see blue reference "B" in Tables 1 and 2 above); and 3) net realized gain (loss) on investments (see blue reference "C" in Tables 1 and 2 above). Since I have refrained from writing a quarterly consolidated statement of operations projection article for FSFR (due to time constraints), I will summarize what I believe will occur within these three amounts during the fiscal third quarter of 2015. Let us first discuss FSFR's NII account. - Confidence Within Range = Moderate to High FSFR reported NII of $10.4 and $6.7 million for the fiscal first and second quarters of 2015, respectively. I am projecting FSFR will report NII of $8.0 million for the fiscal third quarter of 2015. Using Tables 1 and 2 above as a reference, when combined this is a projected NII of $25.1 million for the nine-months ended 6/30/2015. During FSFR's earnings call for the fiscal first quarter of 2015 , management stated the company had a very strong calendar fourth quarter of 2014 regarding loan originations. In fact, management stated most deals that were "in the pipeline" during the fiscal first quarter of 2015 were closed prior to 12/31/2014. As such, FSFR reported quarterly loan originations funded at close and add-on investments of $443 million during the fiscal first quarter of 2015. Since FSFR was able to close most investments in the company's pipeline in the prior quarter, management stated its quarterly loan originations funded at close and add-on investments will be more "normalized" during the fiscal second quarter of 2015. This came to fruition when FSFR reported quarterly loan originations funded at close and add-on investments of only $117 million during the fiscal second quarter of 2015. Since FSFR began to fund FSFR Glick JV in April 2015, I am making the assumption some existing senior secured floating-rate loans were transferred to this entity during the fiscal third quarter of 2015. This transfer would slightly lower the monetary amount of FSFR's investment portfolio due to the fact the company has an 87.5% ownership stake in the JV partnership (as opposed to 100%). In addition, LMM and MM lending, as a whole, has witnessed subdued levels of loan originations over the past several quarters. One exception to this general trend has been originations within the collateralized loan obligation ("CLO") sector. As such, I am projecting FSFR had an "average" level of quarterly loan originations funded at close and add-on investments during the fiscal third quarter of 2015. Therefore, I am projecting FSFR had quarterly loan originations funded at close and add-on investments of approximately $150 million during the fiscal third quarter of 2015 (includes investments transferred to FSFR Glick JV). As a result of FSFR's current strategy of rotating out of certain assets and taking advantage of deals when appropriate, I am projecting the company had portfolio sales/repayments/syndications of approximately ($125) million during the fiscal third quarter of 2015. When combining the company's quarterly loan originations funded at close and add-on investments less portfolio sales/repayments/syndications, I am projecting FSFR's total investment portfolio increased by approximately $25 million for the fiscal third quarter of 2015 (prior to all quarterly FMV fluctuations and scheduled principal payments). As such, quarterly interest income should slightly increase when compared to the prior quarter. The projected increase in quarterly NII ($8.0 million for the fiscal third quarter of 2015 versus $6.7 million for the fiscal second quarter of 2015) is mainly attributed to FSFR beginning to accrue fee, dividend, and other income on FSFR Glick JV during the fiscal third quarter of 2015. This should correspond to a nice added "boost" to FSFR's NII over time. However, due to FSFR's growing investment portfolio, I am also projecting a minor increase to the company's base management fees, incentive fees, and interest expense. Now let us discuss FSFR's net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments account. 2) Net Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments: - Confidence Within Range = Moderate to High - See Blue Reference "B" in Tables 1 and 2 Above Next to the June 30, 2015 Column FSFR reported net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments of ($4.4) and $0.8 million for the fiscal first and second quarters of 2015, respectively. I am projecting FSFR will report net unrealized depreciation on investments of ($0.9) million for the fiscal third quarter of 2015. Using Tables 1 and 2 above as a reference, when combined this is a projected net unrealized depreciation on investments of ($4.4) million (rounded) for the nine-months ended 6/30/2015. In the prior quarter, the following notable valuation changes occurred within this account: 1) unrealized appreciation of $0.3 million on GTCR Valor Companies, Inc.; 2) unrealized appreciation of $0.4 million on TIBCO Software, Inc.; 3) unrealized depreciation of ($0.4) million on Metamorph US 3, LLC; and 4) unrealized depreciation of ($0.5) million on Ameritox Ltd. The remaining net change to this account consisted of numerous minor unrealized FMV fluctuations within the rest of FSFR's investment portfolio. Regarding the fiscal second quarter of 2015, I am partially basing my projection of this account on the fact that all of FSFR's investments are still relatively new (a majority of investments are still only several quarters old). Furthermore, FSFR only has a minimal amount of the company's capital allocated to more risky debt investments (unsecured notes, mezzanine loans) and equity investments. As such, FSFR's FMV fluctuations should also be subdued when compared to most other BDC peers who have a larger proportion of capital allocated to these more risky investment vehicles. FSFR mainly invests in first-lien, senior secured floating-rate debt investments. Spreads within the LMM and MM remained relatively flat during the fiscal third quarter of 2015. Based on this notion (and several other analytical factors), I am projecting the net change to this account consisted of numerous minor - modest unrealized FMV fluctuations on FSFR's investment portfolio. I am not projecting any "material" FMV write-downs or write-ups. This account's projection is formed from a detailed investment portfolio model that will be omitted from this article due to the sheer size of the data. Now let us discuss FSFR's net realized gain (loss) on investments account. 3) Net Realized Gain (Loss) on Investments: - Confidence Within Range = Moderate - See Blue Reference "C" in Tables 1 and 2 Above Next to the June 30, 2015 Column FSFR reported a net realized loss on investments of ($0.6) and ($1.0) million for the fiscal first and second quarters of 2015, respectively. I am projecting FSFR will report a net realized loss on investments of ($0.4) million for the fiscal third quarter of 2015. Using Tables 1 and 2 above as a reference, when combined this is a projected net realized loss on investments of ($2.0) million for the nine-months ended 6/30/2015. This projection assumes a portion of the portfolio exits during the quarter were debt investments sold in the open market which either slightly appreciated or depreciated in value. As such, I'm anticipating several minor to modest net realized gains and losses associated with these types of sales to market participants. Let us now combine the three amounts described above to come up with a proper net increase (decrease) in net assets from operations figure for the nine-months ended 6/30/2015. When combining NII of $25.1 million, a net unrealized depreciation on investments of ($4.4) million, and a net realized loss on investments of ($2.0) million, I am projecting FSFR had an increase in net assets from operations of $18.7 million for the nine-months ended 6/30/2015 (see red reference "A" in Table 2 above). - See Red Reference "B" and Blue Reference "D" in Table 2 Above Next to the June 30, 2015 Column - See Blue Reference "D" in Table 3 Below Side Note: As shown in Table 2 above, FSFR's "net increase (decrease) in net assets from stockholder transactions" figure is the equivalent to the company's "distributions to stockholders from net investment ICTI" figure. Since this is the only amount within this specific classification, both figures will be the same. This is a fairly simple calculation. This is FSFR's dividend distributions for the fiscal first, second, and third quarters of 2015. (Source: Table created entirely by myself, partially using FSFR data obtained from the SEC's EDGAR Database ) Using Table 3 above as a reference, the number of outstanding shares of common stock as of 4/29/2015, 5/28/2015, and 6/29/2015 (ex-dividend dates) is projected to be 29.5 million. This figure is unchanged from FSFR's outstanding shares of common stock as of 3/31/2015. I am also projecting no shares of common stock were issued as part of FSFR's dividend reinvestment plan for the fiscal third quarter of 2015 (discussed later in the article). Since the common stock dividend declared for April 2015, May 2015, and June 2015 was $0.10 per share, I am projecting FSFR's dividend distributions totaled ($8.8) million for the fiscal third quarter of 2015. When this dividend distributions figure is combined with the six-months ended dividend distributions of ($17.7) million, I am projecting FSFR had a decrease in net assets from stockholder transactions of ($26.5) million for the nine-months ended 6/30/2015 (see red reference "B" in Table 2 above and blue reference "D" in Tables 2 and 3 above). - See Red Reference "C" in Table 2 Above Next to the June 30, 2015 Column This "net increase (decrease) in net assets from capital share transactions" figure consists of the following three amounts: 1) issuance of common stock, net (see blue reference "E" in Table 2 above and Table 4 below); 2) issuance of common stock under dividend reinvestment plan, net (see blue reference "F" in Table 2 above and Table 5 below); and 3) repurchases of common stock. - See Blue Reference "E" in Table 2 Above Next to the June 30, 2015 Column - See Blue Reference "E" in Table 4 Below This is FSFR's issuance of common stock, net of underwriting fees and offering costs for the fiscal first, second, and third quarters of 2015. Since FSFR did not have any equity offerings (which would result in the issuance of common stock) during the fiscal first, second, and third quarters of 2015, this figure should remain at $0 for the nine-months ended 6/30/2015 (see blue reference "E" in Table 2 above and Table 4 below). (Source: Table created entirely by myself, partially using FSFR data obtained from the SEC's EDGAR Database [link provided below Table 1]) 2) Issuance of Common Stock Under Dividend Reinvestment Plan: - See Blue Reference "F" in Table 2 Above Next to the June 30, 2015 Column - See Blue Reference "F" in Table 5 Below This is FSFR's issuance of common stock under the company's dividend reinvestment plan for the fiscal first, second, and third quarters of 2015. (Source: Table created entirely by myself, partially using FSFR data obtained from the SEC's EDGAR Database [link provided below Table 1]) Using Table 5 above as a reference, I am assuming management will repurchase outstanding shares of common stock in the open market for the fiscal third quarter of 2015. This is due to the fact FSFR's stock price, at the time of dividend distributions for the quarter, was materially below the company's NAV of $12.46 per share as of 3/31/2015. FSFR repurchases outstanding shares of common stock in the open market to distribute as part of the company's dividend reinvestment plan (net effect of 0 additional outstanding shares of common stock issued). This strategy is implemented when FSFR's stock price, at the time of dividend distributions, is priced at a discount to NAV. As such, I am not projecting any additional capital proceeds from the issuance of new shares of common stock under FSFR's dividend reinvestment plan for the fiscal third quarter of 2015. Therefore, I am projecting FSFR will report an issuance of common stock under the company's dividend reinvestment plan figure of $0 for the nine-months ended 6/30/2015 (see blue reference "F" in Tables 2 and 5 above). - See Table 2 Above Next to the June 30, 2015 Column for Reference Management may intend to repurchase outstanding shares of common stock when FSFR's stock price is at a material discount to the company's NAV. Even though FSFR's stock price, throughout the entire quarter, continued to trade well below the company's NAV of $12.46 per share as of 3/31/2015, I am assuming management did not initiate any share buybacks during the fiscal third quarter of 2015. In my opinion, it would not make too much sense to repurchase outstanding shares of common stock when in August 2014 FSFR issued new shares of common stock at a material discount to NAV as of 6/30/2014. Do not get me wrong, issuing shares at a net issuance price of $12.19 per share and then repurchasing a portion of these outstanding shares at a weighted average price of $10.45 per share for the quarter would be net accretive to FSFR's NAV. However, I do not believe FSFR would pursue such a strategy due to the fact management wanted to use the net proceeds from the August 2014 equity offering to expand the company's investment portfolio. FSFR also needs to consider certain RIC leverage ratio thresholds to remain in compliance with the IRC. Therefore, I am projecting FSFR will report a repurchases of common stock figure of $0 for the nine-months ended 6/30/2015 (see Table 2 above). If FSFR repurchases outstanding shares of common stock in future quarters at this type of discount level, I believe that would be a very positive factor as this would be accretive to NAV. When combining net equity proceeds in common stock issuances of $0, net equity proceeds in relation to the company's dividend reinvestment plan of $0, and equity in relation to repurchases of common stock of $0, I am projecting FSFR had no change in net assets from capital share transactions for the nine-months ended 6/30/2015 (see red reference "C" in Table 2 above). To sum up all the information discussed above, I am projecting FSFR will report the following NAV per share as of 6/30/2015: FSFR's Projected NAV as of 6/30/2015 = $12.38 Per Share FSFR's Projected NAV Range as of 6/30/2015 = $12.23-$12.53 Per Share This projection is a decrease of ($0.08) per share from FSFR's NAV as of 3/31/2015. This minor decrease in NAV can be attributed to the following quarterly per share changes: (Source: Table created entirely by myself, including all calculated figures and projected valuations) Using Table 6 above as a reference, I am projecting FSFR's net increase in net assets resulting from operations (also known as EPS) will be $0.22 per share for the fiscal third quarter of 2015 (rounded to the nearest cent). In comparison, I am projecting FSFR had dividend distributions of ($0.30) per share for the fiscal third quarter of 2015 (also rounded to the nearest cent). After adding these two amounts together, a decrease of ($0.08) per share for the fiscal third quarter of 2015 is obtained. One reason for the projected minor decrease in NAV is in relation to investment depreciation within several of FSFR's portfolio companies during the fiscal third quarter of 2015. The other reason is a projected minor - modest over distribution of NII. With that being said, I am also projecting FSFR generated an economic return of 1.77% for the fiscal third quarter of 2015. I believe this should be seen as a positive sign. From the analysis/discussion provided above, I believe FSFR is currently materially undervalued at a (26.51%) discount to my projected NAV as of 6/30/2015.
