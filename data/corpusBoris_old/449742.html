The Nominal Rate Of Economic Growth Suggests Recession | Seeking Alpha This is a weekly series focused on analyzing the previous week's economic data releases. Our objective is to identify what are leading indicators of economic activity in hopes of gaining insight as to whether the economy is strengthening or weakening. This week we take a look at the ISM Manufacturing Index, auto sales, construction spending and the personal income and spending reports. The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing survey climbed to 53.2 in June from 51.3 in May, with marks the fourth consecutive month that this survey has indicated growth (reading over 50) in this sector. New orders led the charge higher in these survey results with the sub-index rising to 57.0, but we are not convinced this is a lasting turn up in manufacturing activity. Markit's manufacturing survey rose to a far more tepid 51.3 in June, but remains a firm downtrend since peaking in mid-2014. We would like to see both survey confirm an upturn in manufacturing before getting constructive on the sector as a source of economic growth. Last month we surmised that auto sales peaked for the current economic cycle in 2015 at 17.47 million vehicles. The latest monthly report strengthens our conviction, as auto sales declined in June by 2% on a year-over-year basis to a 16.66 million annual rate. This does not bode well for June retail sales, which we will learn about in the coming week. Sales incentives reached an all-time high last month, which is evidence that sales are starting to wane. We expect a decline in auto sales to weigh significantly on year-over-year consumer spending growth over the next 12 months. The construction spending report includes the total value of all new construction activity for residential, non-residential and public projects. The chart on year-over-year construction spending growth is ugly. There is no other way to describe it. Construction spending fell 0.8% in May. The 1.8% decline in April, which was the largest decline in five years, was revised lower to a decline of 2.0. Construction spending is now up 2.8% on a year-over-year basis, which is the slowest growth rate since November 2011. The past two months of decline will negatively impact second-quarter GDP. Personal income rose 0.2% in May, while personal spending, otherwise known as personal consumption expenditures or consumer spending, increased 0.4%. Personal income is up 4.0% over the past year, while real consumer spending has risen 2.7%. The personal income figure is not our preferred measurement of income growth, as average hourly earnings are a more accurate leading indicator of the trend in consumer spending. This is because average hourly earnings exclude the highly compensated, who spend a much smaller amount of their overall income than do workers who earn an hourly wage. Average hourly earnings rose 0.2% in May and are up 2.5% on a year-over-year basis, but only 1.4% on an inflation-adjusted basis. That is our key leading indicator for real consumer spending growth. We continue to believe that the confluence of data point to a US economy that is weakening from its peak rate of growth nearly two years ago. The annualized rate of growth in the first quarter was 2.1%. Considering that the Consumer Price Index is at an annual run rate of 1.1%, this means that the nominal rate of growth is a mere 3.3%. Based on historical data, the US economy has typically been in recession when year-over-year nominal GDP growth has fallen below 4%. Irrespective of whether we are in recession, business conditions remain brutal. We see no catalyst for a reacceleration in economic growth in the second half of this year that is required to realize the recovery in corporate earnings and revenue growth that the consensus is expecting.
