IXYS' (IXYS) CEO Nathan Zommer on Q4 2015 Results - Earnings Call Transcript | Seeking Alpha Good day and welcome to the IXYS Corporation's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dr. Nathan Zommer, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir. Thank you. Good morning and welcome to IXYS Corporation's fourth quarter and fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 earnings conference call. I am joined by Uzi Sasson, our President and CFO. Uzi will lead us through the financial discussion later in the call. First, to review the formalities. Our discussion today contains forward-looking statements, including statements related to potential future revenues and earnings. Any statements in this conference call that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. There are a number of important factors that could cause the result of IXYS to differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements, including among others risks detailed from time to time in our SEC reports, including our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the period ended December 31, 2014. IXYS does not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also, please be advised that the financial data related to today's conference call is available on our Web-site, www.ixys.com. Click on 'Corporate' and then click on 'News & Events'. The results of the March 31 quarter which is also our fiscal 2015 year-end demonstrates IXYS transformation into a broad-range semiconductor company both organically and through acquisitions. We are seeing strong growth in our IC business as it complements our power semiconductor market penetrations, especially in the consumer market. We have also witnessed the expansion of our sales into Asia. I would like to draw your attention to a few highlights. For the quarter, revenues for the quarter increased sequentially from the December 2014 quarter. Net income for the quarter was $7.8 million, an increase of $7.7 million or 5806% as compared to net income for the same period in the prior fiscal year. Earnings per diluted share in the quarter were $0.24 as compared to $0.0 in the same period last fiscal year. Gross profit margin increased to 30.5%. IXYS declared a $0.035 per share dividend on February 6, 2015. And now for the year. Net revenues were $338.8 million, an increase of $2.4 million from the prior fiscal year. Net income was $23.7 million, an increase of $17.7 million or 292.7% compared to fiscal 2014. Earnings per diluted share were $0.74 for the fiscal year, $0.55 more than the prior fiscal year. Gross profit was $102 million or 30.1% of net revenues as compared to gross profit of $100.2 million or 29.8% of net revenues for the prior fiscal year. Now I will turn to revenue data by regions, market segments and product group. As a percentage of total revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, North America represented 25.6%, Europe and Middle East 27%, and Asia and the rest of the world 47.4%. As a percentage of total revenues for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015, North America represented 25.7%, Europe and Middle East 29.6%, and Asia and the rest of the world 44.7%. Our revenues by market segment for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 were as follows. Industrial and commercial including renewable energy 44%, communication infrastructure 13%, medical electronics 8%, consumer 17%, transportation including auto and traction 4%, and other 14%. Our revenues by market segment for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 were as follows. Industrial and commercial 45%, communication infrastructure 13%, medical electronics 9%, consumer 16%, transportation 4%, and others 13%. Our revenues based on product groups for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 were 64.6% for power semiconductors, 29.7% for integrated circuits which includes microcontrollers, and 5.7% for systems and RF. Our revenue based on product group for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 were 64.8% for power semiconductors, 28.2% for integrated circuits, and 7% for system and RF. We are executing on our growth initiatives and diversify into more value-added ICs and power semiconductors in our focused markets. We continue to generate cash which we use to invest in new products and technology. Cash generated has also been shared with our shareholders as dividends. We have a global presence especially in Asia which allows us to leverage the world of IXYS marketing campaign in high-growth markets. We've allocated some of our manufacturing base to lower-cost Asian subcontractors thereby allowing us to produce more products at reduced costs and improved time-to-market performance. I will now turn the call over to Uzi Sasson, President and CFO, who will discuss the financials in more detail. Thanks Nathan. GAAP net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2015 was $7.8 million or $0.24 per diluted share, an increase of $7.7 million from the March 31, 2014 quarter, which show the net income of $132,000, or $0.00 per diluted share. The March 2015 quarter non-GAAP net income, which excludes the impact of charges for amortization of acquired intangible assets and stock compensation, was $9.9 million, or $0.30 per diluted share. This was an increase of $6.3 million, as compared to the non-GAAP net income of $3.6 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, for the same period in the prior fiscal year. GAAP net income for the twelve months ended March 31, 2015 was $23.7 million, or $0.74 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $6 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, for the same period in the prior fiscal year. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2015, non-GAAP net income was $32 million, or $1 per diluted share. This compared favorably to non-GAAP net income of $17.8 million, or $0.56 per diluted share, for the same period in the prior fiscal year. Gross profit for the quarter ended March 31, 2015 was $25.3 million, or 30.5% of net revenues, as compared to the gross profit of $25.4 million, or 28.2% of net revenues, for the same quarter in the prior fiscal year. Our gross profit increased by 2.3 percentage points this quarter over the comparable period in the fiscal year 2014. Gross profit for the twelve months ended March 31, 2015 was $102 million, or 30.1% of net revenues, as compared to the gross profit of $100.2 million, or 29.8% of net revenues, for the same period in the prior fiscal year. R&D spending for the quarter was $6.2 million or 7.5% of net sales as compared to $7.9 million or 8.7% of net sales in the prior year quarter. For the year, R&D spending was $26.7 million as compared to $30.9 million in the prior fiscal year. We expect to continue to spend in the range of $25 million to $30 million a year on R&D. We have become even more selective in our projects and developments as we work to meet the needs of current power semiconductor customers. We are also working to address the growing demand for the MCUs and Internet of things technologies. SG&A expenses were $10.1 million or 12.2% of net sales as compared to $11.3 million or 12.6% of net sales in the prior year quarter. We are pleased by the efforts to decrease SG&A expenses as IXYS is committed to tight cost controls which can potentially lead to higher profitability. CapEx was approximately $1.7 million for the March quarter. Capital expenditures include purchases of manufacturing equipment. Turning to the balance sheet, the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 3.2. The Company exited the March 31, 2015 quarter with cash and cash equivalents totaling approximately $121.2 million. We generated $16.1 million in cash from operations during the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA which excludes stock based compensation expense was $14 million for the quarter and $52 million for the year ended March 31, 2015. In the quarter ended March 31, 2015, the Company declared $0.035 per share dividend, highlighting the third consecutive quarter of dividends. We returned about $4.3 million to stockholders in fiscal 2015 through dividends. Net accounts receivables at March 31, 2015 were $41 million and DSO was approximately 45 days. As of March 31, 2015, net inventory was $82 million and inventory turns were 2.8x during the quarter. We are pleased that our production efficiencies, low-cost outsourcing and Lean Six Sigma initiatives have resulted in streamlined manufacturing, better logistics and timely delivery to customers. Although we are seeing modest growth in the U.S. and Asia, customers are still reluctant to stock inventory. Rather, customers are purchasing products with short lead times. Our manufacturing efficiencies have allowed us to capture this business. We are equally pleased with the sales efforts that resulted in strong adoption of products across almost all lines with notable growth in the integrated circuit microcontroller businesses. Our core power business in industrial and commercial applications continues to drive our Company forward. While we are upbeat about the future prospects for IXYS, we must be cautious about the near-term headwinds related to global macroeconomic conditions. To that end, we expect revenues in the June 2015 quarter to be in line with revenues of the March 2015 quarter. Just first on the gross margin side, it was up year-over-year, slightly below expectations here, so can you give me a little bit of color as to how much currency impact there is there, where utilization comes into play, how much of your production is in-house versus outsourced at this point, just some color there? Okay, so let's start from the last question, Chris. About 60% of our products or a little less is being manufactured in-house and the rest is being outsourced to our traditional foundries and subcontractors. As we mentioned in our comments, we are migrating more and more manufacturing to Asia so that we can produce at lower cost in terms of our product. In terms of, you asked about the utilization, we are currently between 65% to 80% utilization in our all internal fabs but I shall also mention that we have ample of capacity at the outside foundries. Gross margin increased by 230 basis points or 2.3 percentage points and we are continuing to work on those. If you ask about the FX and the impact on gross margin, we had some FX impact on that but the good thing about our Company and about IXYS is that we have a natural hedge. I mean that for example in Germany we buy and sell in euro or in the U.K. we buy and sell in British pounds and we view that as a natural hedge. Chris, this is Nathan. As you know, if you look at our distribution of revenues, you see that we are quite strong in Europe and Middle East, and because the euro lost value against the dollar, indeed there was a little impact that the margins got bitten a little bit but it's not major. Okay. And just on the tax rate, it's been kind of low last couple of quarters. Is there a new kind of tax rate assumption we should be using? So, Chris, I actually anticipated that question last night. I appreciate that very much so. So few quarters ago we indicated that we put a tax planning strategy. We have headquarters in the Netherlands and we've done several acquisitions that help us in that. I think that the rate will continue to decline over time. This is part of our strategy and a strategic direction. We're working on it. And I would anticipate that in the next fiscal year our tax rate will continue to decline. I would suspect that it's going to be between 25% to 30% rate for the year. And just in terms of you had some pricing talks with some customers, specifically some European customers, is there any update on those pricing talks and possible price increases? So we are working on that. It's pretty clear to us that many of our customers are coming back because they need our product. As you know, we have good technology with A+ performances. It's work-in-process, we're working with them, we're increasing prices where we can, and we're working on that. We're going to start seeing the benefits of that as we go into the future and this is another initiative that we undertook several quarters ago and we'll start seeing the benefits of that. Chris, I want to add to that. It's a very tight rope when you increase customers in those global conglomerate and you have to make sure you don't upset them too much but you have to be rational. So we have taken at the top management an approach in the model also that maybe it's better to get less revenue but gross margin increase and it will affect the bottom line of profits. As you know, all our operating expenses went down, a great job by Uzi and his team, and that's why we are able, even if you see modest growth in margins, tremendous leverage in growth in the net income per share. So this model works. With that, nonetheless, we are very sensitive to the issues of some customers that indeed we told them, listen, we cannot continue selling at those prices at below our average margin and we have to be able to do a balancing act to still engage with them, we still sell other products to them but we make it very clear we are transitioning to the benefit of our shareholders, to products that have more value-added, and that has been the focus and we see that benefit to the bottom line. Can you talk specifically about some steps you're taking to improve your gross margins, and specifically related to capacity, as you're moving some of your products to Asia, do you guys need to reduce capacity internally, how do you think about that balance as you move more and more products to Asia? This is Nathan, I'll answer that. That is a key strategic core action that we take in the Company. Some of our products are very high voltage. There are no foundries around the world that can produce it for us and it contains a very high value for our proprietary know-how. So this kind of technology we like to keep in-house. What we are doing, and again Uzi and the team did a fabulous job in optimizing the wafer fabs that we have, the main silicon wafer fabs that we have, one in Massachusetts, Beverly Maas., one in Germany and one in the U.K., where we keep the proprieted product in-house and utilize the capacity in Massachusetts even to support classical products that we used to make in the facility in Germany – mainly in Germany. What results on that is that we use minimal CapEx to produce advanced technology products that otherwise we should have paid a lot of money in upgrading the fab in Germany for that matter. So we are glad that we have this internal capacity, gives us flexibility. Nonetheless, products or part of the process that is non-proprietary, we are starting to fab out to foundries and this is an ongoing process, and this by itself will reduce our manufacturing cost and improve the gross margin. The other action that is not related to internal fab, the most expensive fabs, or let me say the most advanced processes that take very advanced equipment, we don't need to buy, there's ample capacity worldwide and we started a major initiative to produce more of our integrated circuit MCUs and the like in foundries in Asia, including China. So for that matter we are very satisfied that we have a solid plan and you'll see the results that as revenues grows with the higher value added product, we are relying less on internal fabs which by sense improve the margins. No, we have – as Uzi said, we also initiated that we have a base power business that it's still there, and that's the comment that Uzi said on the macroeconomics, the industrial market which is mainly affected by infrastructure investment in Asia slowed down a little bit as we know in the last three years, once it will come back our fabs will be utilized to the [till] [ph] and still we see growth in the utilization of our internal fab. The fab utilization rate increases slowly over time. So we are very happy seeing that. Okay. Back to Chris' question, you mentioned you'd like to be at 35% gross margin by the end of the year. Is there a revenue number associated with that 35% gross margin? Absolutely. It's key on growth of the revenue, and statistically if you look at the times where we executed with the growth of the market, we have seen more than 10% annual revenue growth year-to-year. So it couples with that. We'd like to see more than 10% annual revenue growth all across the board, and with the efficiency we're taking we'll be there at about 35% gross margin. Okay. Nathan, there's been a lot of consolidation in the industry. You guys traded 1x EBITDA sales and 12.5x non-GAAP numbers. Are you guys open to discuss a deal with someone, and if so, can you give some color on what expectations you might have? It just seems like the market doesn't recognize the value for IXYS, so maybe if you could talk a little bit about that? Sure. As you know the history of the Company, we have done a lot of our own M&A and business development internally. As a result of that we have very few analysts that cover the story. So now I know by admission of some bankers and the like that indeed IXYS is not in the prime limelight, but nonetheless IXYS have been approached by many entities and we are always open to discussions, we bring it to the Board, and due to the confidentiality of those relationships, when there is something substantial we'll announce, but indeed the consolidation in the market creates tremendous momentum and interest in IXYS, we have a very unique situation, and also we are very unique that the employees have a big chunk of ownership in the Company. So making a short statement, yes, IXYS is in the target of a lot of conglomerate worldwide on strategic initiatives and we are open. What seems to be the hang-up when you do take it to the Board, is it price, is it – how do you think about that? I'll give you an example. We look what happens, recent acquisition companies with performance even less than ours, less than ours, let me say it, less profitability than ours, were sold at 3x revenues. So you took it from that. And IXYS has a lot of unrecognized assets that it's not so easy for an uninterested party to realize, the real estate we own, the technology we own, the patents, the IPs, and the solid performance. So we think that based on what other companies paid for companies with less bottom-line performance than ours, that it was 3x revenue, I think that's a reasonable target. So when we have offers, always, we had several times, we invited the potential parties to present to the Board and usually we let the independent Board members discuss it, review it, and if there is something I'm sure there will be an announcement. Thank you.
