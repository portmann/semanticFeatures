Learn more about PRO » Given the fundamental weaknesses at Birks Group, the potential investors should wait for sustainable profit growth to materialize prior to taking the plunge with this company. Based on Birks Group's current business model and sector outlook, it is difficult to find a realistic scenario that would get the company to sustainable profitability and debt service. Bikini Village filed for bankruptcy protection back in Q1 2015 and was finally sold to Boutique La Vie en Rose Inc. for just C$3.8 million. Needless to mention that the net proceeds of the sale were distributed to the company's creditors. Bikini Village whose securities traded on the TSX Venture Exchange under the stock symbol GBV was the latest publicly traded retailer who went broke in North America, following Target (NYSE: TGT ) whose Canadian subsidiary filed for bankruptcy protection and exited Canada in Q1 2015 as well. Actually, Bikini Village and Target's Canadian subsidiary joined several privately held retailers that have also filed for bankruptcy lately like Nine West owned by Toronto-based Sherson, Mexx, Smart Set owned by Reitmans, Bombay, Bowring, Benix and Jacob to name a few. That said, who is the next struggling retailer with a probability of bankruptcy over the next 12 months? Well, I will tell you up front. To me, Birks Group's (NYSEMKT: BGI ) future is bleak and therefore, both the existing shareholders and the potential investors had better avoid this stock, because the company will most likely file for bankruptcy by 2016. Birks Group is an operator of luxury jewelry stores in the U.S. and Canada. As of June 30, 2015, Birks operated 27 stores under the Birks brand in Canada, 17 stores in Florida and Georgia under the Mayors brand, one store under the Rolex brand name and two retail locations in Calgary and Vancouver under the Brinkhaus brand. This is one of the oldest luxury retailers in North America, given that Birks and Mayors brands were founded in 1879 and 1910 respectively. 1) Birks incurred $2.6 million of restructuring charges as a result of the fact that it implemented an operational restructuring plan in an effort to drive efficiencies while delivering stronger sales compared to the previous years. On that front, the company's strategy was to focus on its more productive stores while closing the underperforming store locations. To reduce costs, Birks also relocated most of its corporate administrative workforce from its regional office in Tamarac, Fla., to its Montreal corporate head office between January and March 2015. In addition, the restructuring plan included the outsourcing of a portion of the company's manufacturing operations and other corporate head office staff reductions. 2) Birks amended its senior secured credit facilities in order to increase its breathing space. I quote some key details from that amendment: "On June 12, 2014, Montrovest B.V., Birks' controlling shareholder delivered a $5.0 million irrevocable standby letter of credit in favor of the Company's senior secured revolving credit lenders in order to provide the Company with additional operating liquidity. In exchange for the delivery of the LC as collateral, the senior secured lenders lifted an existing discretionary reserve of $7 million that had been imposed by the term loan agent. The Company is required to maintain excess availability under its senior secured revolving credit agreement of at least $10 million at all times. In addition, the secured term loan lender agreed not to impose any discretionary reserves in the calculation of the Company's borrowing availability under the senior secured revolving credit agreement through February 10, 2015 so long as no event of default exists. As part of the amendment to the senior secured term loan, the Company also agreed to modify the rate of interest from 8.77% to 11.27%. In addition, the Company agreed to continue to retain the services of its financial advisor, provide weekly updated 13 week cash flow projections acceptable to the senior secured revolving credit lender and senior secured term loan lender as well as weekly variance reports against the cash flow projections until a recapitalization plan satisfactory to the senior secured lenders has been consummated, and meet certain required milestones on the dates set forth in Schedule III to the amendments to its senior secured revolving credit agreement and senior secured term loan agreement. As part of the amendments to the senior secured credit facilities, the Company also agreed that deviations of greater than 10% from the cash flow projections will be considered an event of default, and if the Company does not accomplish the Milestones, additional fees and in some cases an additional reserve of up to $5 million may be established by the lenders reducing availability under the senior secured credit facilities until such failure is cured by the Company". The aforementioned restructuring plan had some positives primarily associated with the company's top line, according to the company's latest report . Specifically: 1) Net sales in FY 2015 increased by $20.5 million to $301.6 million from $281.2 million in the prior fiscal year despite a weakening Canadian dollar. Revenue was about evenly split between jewelry and timepieces, and between the Canadian stores and the ones in the U.S. 2) Comparable store sales in FY 2015 increased by 16% compared to the prior fiscal year. Although comparable store sales, also known as same store sales, are an indicator of store performance, they are neither foolproof nor indicative of the company's fundamental health. For instance, if store sales are typically strong during a flexible holiday such as Easter, which might occur in March one year and April the next, the results are skewed regardless of whether monthly or quarterly sales are compared. A special sales promotion not offered the previous year could also skew the figures for a given period of the year. 3) Gross profit in FY 2015 increased $3.1 million to $117.8 million from $114.7 million in the prior fiscal year. 4) Selling, general and administrative expenses fell to $103.7 million for fiscal 2015 compared to $105.5 million for fiscal 2014. But obviously, the aforementioned strategic initiatives have hardly made a dent thus far. The recovery in net sales is sluggish, the balance sheet remains extremely weak and the company's fundamentals continue to deteriorate reflecting this overwhelming weakness while painting an ugly picture for the shareholders. Specifically: 1) The company recognized a net loss for fiscal 2015 of approximately $8.6 million compared to a net loss of approximately $5.8 million in fiscal 2014. Excluding the impact of $2.6 million of restructuring charges, $0.2 million of impairment charges and $2.6 million of debt extinguishment charges recorded during fiscal 2015, the company's net loss for fiscal 2015 was $3.1 million. 2) The stockholders' equity continued to slide and reached $2.8 million in March 2015. For reference, the stockholders' equity was at $13.6 million in March 2014. Therefore, the stockholders' equity declined more than 70% within the last twelve months. Also, it must be noted that Birks's inventories stood at $135.7 million (March 2015). But, it's doubtful that Birks could unload its inventories at prices near book value if it needs to do so quickly. Actually, selling off all of the inventory without a downsize and fire sale is rather impossible. As a result, a reduction in inventory's book value will wipe out the remaining stockholders' equity of $2.8 million, which will drop into negative territory. 3) Interest bearing debt totaled $121.1 million at the end of fiscal 2015, as compared to $128.7 million at the end fiscal 2014, a decrease of $7.6 million. Excluding the $7.6 million of foreign currency translation, the level of the company's debt is consistent with the end of fiscal 2014. 4) The adjusted EBITDA in FY 2015 was $14.1 million, which translates into a staggering Debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 8.59 times. 5) Given that the stockholder equity is only $2.8 million, the company's debt-to-equity ratio is 43 times. In other words, there is an overwhelmingly high proportion of debt in the company's capital structure. 6) The company has limited liquidity, given that its cash was $2.4 million and the excess borrowing capacity under the senior secured revolving credit facility was $12.9 million as of March 28, 2015 compared to $17.2 million at the end of fiscal 2014. This is why, Birks has been actively engaged since late 2014 in identifying alternative sources of financing to provide greater financial resources for the company's operations and capital investment needs. To date, the management team has not managed to find a strategic partner willing to inject capital into the company. 7) Interest and financing costs in fiscal 2015 were $11.3 million and increased $1.8 million in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. This increase was primarily associated with a higher level of total average debt and higher interest rates related to the amendments of the company's senior secured term loan. 8) The operating margin in FY 2015 did not change compared to FY 2014 and remained below 2%. 9) The good thing is that inventories in March 2015 ($135.7 million) have slightly dropped compared to March 2014 ($144.6 million) and the company's current ratio stands at 1.2 times. At first glance, this metric looks decent, but this is not enough. When doing analysis on retailers, the current ratio is often misleading and a canny investor will always look at the Quick Ratio, which is also called the "Acid Test Ratio" whose equation is: Acid Test Ratio = (Current assets - Inventory) : Current liabilities Given that almost all of Birks's current assets are in the form of inventories ($135.7 million compared to $148 million of total current assets), Birks's Acid Test Ratio stands at: Acid Test Ratio = ($148M - $135.7M) : $121.9M = $12.3M : $121.9M = 0.1 times Birks's Valuation And The Peer Group In this paragraph, let's take a look at the company's peers and their valuations, based on their closing prices as of 07/24/2015: (*): Estimate, based on the latest corporate guidance for 2015 and Q1 2015 results. (**): For the fiscal year ending March 26, 2016. (***): For the fiscal year ending January 31, 2016. But, do not let the previous table fool you. From an EV/EBITDA standpoint, Birks looks cheap but Birks is not cheap, let alone undervalued compared to its counterparts. For a better understanding of the company's financial health, we need to take a closer look at the debt ratios, as shown below: (**): Estimate, based on the latest corporate guidance for 2015 and Q1 2015 results. (***): For the fiscal year ending March 26, 2016. (****): For the fiscal year ending January 31, 2016. It is clear that Birks carries a debt overload that threatens its future and largely explains why the company currently trades 9.13 times its annual adjusted EBITDA, which is lower than the industry average. Birks Has Major Headwinds To Face Going Forward Let's get real. Birks has an extremely weak balance sheet while also having to handle the following headwinds in the coming quarters: 1) Lack of international business: It is not accidental that Tiffany earns roughly two-thirds of its revenue outside the U.S. International expansion (i.e. Asia-Pacific region, Japan, Latin America) has been the key driver of growth for the major players of the sector over the last years, with China being on the top of demand growth for the jewelry industry, given that the size of the middle and affluent classes in China has been growing and will continue to grow considerably by the end of the decade. But, Birks is not there. Birks does not have an international presence and more importantly, its weak balance sheet does not allow it to establish a global presence over the coming quarters. 2) Canada and the U.S. are over-saturated markets: When it comes to jewelry and timepieces, North America is an over-saturated market where the brick and mortar retailers like Birks have to compete both with the online retailers and with numerous other brick and mortar companies. It is an undeniable fact that the brick and mortar retailers have two key advantages compared to the online ones. First, they offer the potential customers the chance to hold things in their hands before they buy. Second, they have easier return policies affecting positively the post-purchase experience. However, these advantages are not enough to attract avid online shoppers who prefer to make their purchases, including jewelry and timepieces, from e-retailers like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY ), Overstock (NASDAQ: OSTK ), Blue Nile, Posh Gallery, Charm Junction and Jewelry Television, to name a few. On the other hand, Nordstrom (NYSE: JWN ), Dillard's (NYSE: DDS ), Macy's (NYSE: M ), Saks Fifth Avenue, Reeds Jewelers, Bloomingdale's, J.C. Penney (NYSE: JCP ) and many other brick and mortar companies will continue to fight for market share, placing hurdles on Birks's efforts to increase its operating margin, strengthen its domestic sales and grow substantially in North America over the next years. The stiff competition from these stores is not going to go away anytime soon. 3) Weakening retail sales: According to the latest news , Americans cut back their spending last month with the reversal being much sharper than projected. After May's large gain of 1%, consumers did not rein in their spending and retail sales fell 0.3% in June 2015, which was the weakest showing since February's harsh winter weather kept shoppers indoors. Of course, one soft month is not a trend but this was a sign that Americans remain cautious despite robust job growth over the last months. Although the impact on Birks's sales might be reduced due to the focus on the higher-income customer with greater discretionary income, the continuation of the weakening sales over the next months will not leave Birks's top and bottom lines unaffected. Jewelry purchases are highly discretionary, and therefore a continued decrease in consumer spending could negatively impact Birks's sales, even if higher spending luxury consumers are more resilient than middle-class customers and can carry on spending. Can A Sale And Leaseback Strategy Provide Substantial Relief To Birks Group? Sale and Leaseback is one of the real estate maneuvers that the retailers with big property footprints, debt overhang and lagging sales have been choosing lately to address the maturity of their credit facilities, reduce their debt overhang and enhance their financial flexibility, as real estate prices gain ground. On that front, several companies have announced such real estate moves recently like Hudson's Bay Company (OTC: HBAYF ), The Bon-Ton Stores (NASDAQ: BONT ), Sears (NASDAQ: SHLD ), Darden Restaurants (NYSE: DRI ), as shown here , here and here , while others like Macy's with about 885 stores under the Macy's and Bloomingdale's brands has announced : "We are currently evaluating those structures including analyzing the various economic, tax, operational and other issues associated with them." As such, a potential investor might assume that Birks could implement this strategy over the next months in order to offset the negative impact of the aforementioned headwinds, reduce its debt load and bring it down to more manageable levels. The thing is that there is a fundamental problem with this strategy. The book value for Birks's "property and equipment" is just $28.5 million, according to the latest quarterly report. I do not have any insight into how this value is allocated to "property" and "equipment," and therefore, I will project that 90% of this value goes to "property" and the remaining 10% goes to "equipment." On that front, I will assume that Birks will sell its properties at book value and use all the proceeds to lower its debt. Upon completion of this hypothetical scenario, the company's debt will drop down to approximately $100 million but the debt ratios will remain too high, continuing to threaten the company's survival. In other words, the sale and leaseback strategy seems to be more like an attempt to buy time and kick the can down the road without permanently resolving the company's debt problems. Currently, the only thing that can propel Birks Group's stock higher is an acquisition announcement. But, who is willing to pay more than $1.06/share (closing price as of 07/23/2015) or approximately 6.5 times the company's sequentially declining book value, despite the fact that the company has been losing money while having staggering debt ratios? Therefore, this speculative scenario is highly unlikely, in my opinion. Given that the clock stops for no one, Birks Group has to find a viable strategy and business model in order to remain competitive, put an end to its losses and get back on a sustainable growth trajectory. But, it's not easy. The high interest costs coupled with the reasons mentioned in a previous paragraph will hardly allow the company to substantially increase its revenue and widen its current extremely low operating margin of 2% during FY 2016. The substantial revenue and margin growth is a very difficult goal to achieve, because I am not convinced by the underlying strength of the company's business model and the operating environment. As such, Birks will most likely be unable to record significant profits in the coming quarters in order to prevent the stockholders' equity from becoming negative by the end of March 2016. More importantly, the company has limited liquidity. The cash was $2.3 million and the excess borrowing capacity under the senior secured revolving credit facility was $12.9 million (as of March 28, 2015), while Birks is required to maintain excess availability under its senior secured revolving credit agreement of at least $10 million at all times, as mentioned above. Also, the company does not have a history of generating free cash flow over the last years. Specifically, Birks did not generate free cash flow in FY 2012 and FY 2013, it burned $25.9 million in FY 2014, while its free CF was only $4.3 million in FY 2015. And this happened despite the fact that consumer spending has been fairly strong in North America with retail sales being on a gradual recovery mode over the last three years. As a result, it will not be easy for Birks to make two principal payments on long-term debt of $4.7 million and $5.1 million by March 2016 and March 2017 respectively, given that it has limited liquidity and difficulty in generating a substantial amount of free cash flow on an annual basis. As also linked above, the company must comply with certain financial covenants associated with its terms loans with Investissement Québec. As of March 28, 2015, the company had received a waiver of default until April 1, 2016 from Investissement Québec, once it was determined that the company would not be able to meet one of the financial covenants associated with its term loans. Investissement Québec has agreed to waive the calculation requirement for this covenant for the company's fiscal year ending March 27, 2016. Will Birks receive another waiver of default until April 1, 2017? Obviously, Birks is on a razor's edge and the implementation of a recapitalization plan, which will involve raising additional capital in the form of equity, another waiver and another extension of the credit facility is necessary. But, the completion of this plan is not a sure thing. If a strategic partner shows up, he will most likely buy shares at a much lower price than the current price of $1.01/share. And if this plan does not come to fruition, Birks will not be able to continue to operate indefinitely and will wind up in bankruptcy court. After all, I recommend that potential investors avoid and/or short this stock at the current price of $1.01/share.
