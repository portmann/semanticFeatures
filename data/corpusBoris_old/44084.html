What Is Weighing On The U.S. Dollar? | Seeking Alpha U.S. economic growth is becoming more moderate. Moreover, household and business spending have failed to reach escape velocity upward. With policymakers unlikely to raise lending rates in a decelerating economic environment, the U.S. dollar could weaken in coming months. The U.S. dollar has fallen as economic growth came in below estimates, led by weaker consumer spending and business investment. The U.S. dollar is represented by PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bullish (NYSEARCA: UUP ). Economic growth continues to improve, but is still below pre-recession peaks. In the first quarter, the economic growth figure came in at an annual pace of 2.66%, above the previous quarter's reading of 2.39%. Over the past few years, economic growth has fluctuated in its current range, unable to reach escape velocity higher, seen below. Analysts believe the lack of sustainable upward momentum in growth will force the Federal Reserve to wait before it begins raising lending rates. "The U.S. economy has yet to demonstrate the self-sustaining resilience that the Fed wants to see before raising interest rates. A June liftoff is now off the table, our forecast for a September move holds but even that has become tenuous," according to Reuters. Data provided by the Federal Reserve Moreover, within the economic growth reading, business investment measures have been slow to pick up steam. In the first quarter, the business investment figure came in at an annual pace of 7.47%, down from the previous quarter's reading of 7.62%. After peaking at over 11% in 2012, business investment has fallen lower. Weakness in mining and oil exploration accounted for a large portion of the slowdown in business spending. "The decline was driven by mining exploration, shafts and wells investment, which plunged at a 48.7% pace. Nonresidential structures lopped off 0.75 percentage point from growth. Schlumberger (NYSE: SLB ), the world's No. 1 oil-field services provider, has slashed its capital spending plans for this year by about $500 million to $2.5 billion, while competitor Halliburton (NYSE: HAL ) cut its by about 15% to $2.8 billion," according to Reuters. Data provided by the Federal Reserve Lastly, consumer spending similarly weighed on the growth measure. In the first quarter, the household consumption figure came in at an annual pace of 3.85%, down from the previous quarter's reading of 3.88%. Since peaking in 2011 at nearly 5%, household consumption has trended steadily lower. Increased savings and adverse weather conditions are blamed for the recent slowdown in spending measures. "The weather impact was evident in weakness in consumer spending. Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, slowed to a 1.9% rate. That was the slowest in a year and followed a brisk 4.4% pace in the fourth quarter. The sharp moderation in consumer spending came even though households enjoyed huge savings from a big drop in gasoline prices. Consumers boosted their savings to $727.8 billion from $603.4 billion in the fourth quarter, which should provide a tailwind for future consumer spending," according to Reuters. More moderate economic growth could lead the Federal Reserve to hold lending rates low over a longer period of time. Headline economic growth, as well as household and business spending measures came in below estimates in the first quarter. Policymakers may be hesitant to raise lending rates while growth measures are losing momentum, which could weigh on the strength of the U.S. dollar in coming months.
