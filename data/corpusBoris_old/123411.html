Synaptics: Well Positioned In Mobile - Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA) | Seeking Alpha Recent acquisitions were well timed and diversify the revenue base. Long-term trends in mobile device growth are unlikely to change. 2014 and 2015 have been fundamentally game-changing years for Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ: SYNA ). Fiscal 2014 saw the integration of Validity Sensors (biometric fingerprint authentication) and Renesas SP Drivers (leading provider of display drivers for smartphones and tablets) into earnings, helping catapult revenue up 43% over 2013. These were important acquisitions for the company that allowed the company to move from a one-trick pony to a provider of multiple solutions for devices. Astute deal-making and revenue diversification, along with an incredibly strong year for smartphones in general, led shares to more than double at one point from pre-deal share prices of $45/share to highs of slightly above $100/share. With shares now trading back down at near $82/share, does this company now provide a compelling risk/reward profile going forward? Synaptics is all about human interface solutions. In today's markets, that essentially means touch-based interaction with devices. The company's business has increasingly been driven by growth in mobile device markets. In Synaptics' fiscal 2012, mobile applications made up roughly half revenue. In fiscal 2015, that number is set to exceed three quarters of revenue. Continued top-line growth will have to come from continued mobile device expansion along with increased partnership with OEM suppliers. Current market estimates for mobile growth are optimistic - most research predicts high single digit growth for many years to come. This likely growth should be a supportive tailwind of Synaptics shares in the years to come. The company's current OEM customers include American stalwarts Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), electronics giant Samsung (OTC: SSNLF ) and Chinese smartphone heavyweights Huawei and ZTE Corporation (OTCPK: ZTCOF ). Of note for investors is a lack of an Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) contract. Apple does fingerprint ID (through its AuthenTec acquisition) and most other touch solutions in-house. Synaptics does none of the manufacturing of its products itself, instead electing to utilize outside relationships with semiconductor manufacturers and other businesses for testing/assembly instead of doing the work in-house. As you may have guessed, these are low-cost Asian manufacturers. While this business model allows Synaptics to focus on research/development and product design while keeping inventory low, it does expose the company to risk. Synaptics does not have long-term agreements with any of its manufacturers that guarantee a set level of production, a set price, or schedules. A failure of its suppliers to provide Synaptics products on time could result in lost or damaged relationships with important OEM electronic manufacturers. Such relationships can be incredibly difficult to repair. Investors should note that the fiscal year for Synaptics runs through the end of June, so the company's fiscal 2015 has wrapped up and we are waiting on year-end earnings results on July 30, 2015. I've included my own estimates for the company's fiscal fourth quarter, in-line with management and Street expectations. Revenues for 2015 are likely to be almost double 2014 results due to acquisitions and strong organic growth. Investors should take note of declining gross margins, however. It is clear that the Renesas display driver business carries much lower margins than the old business, although I believe there was some margin compression driven by pressure from cost-cutting OEM smartphone suppliers as well. Investors should not expect a return to the operating margins of 2013. However, Synaptics has enjoyed significant leverage on the SG&A side. There was definite margin improvement to be garnered here as the company can cross-sell its products with its existing suppliers. There was likely heavy overlap on the sales-side that allowed the company to cut costs here. SG&A expenses in Q3 2015 were only up 38% over Q3 2014 while sales more than doubled from $204M to $478M. If this can be continued, this is a very bullish indicator for the company's future profitability. Management has set a 15-20% growth target for fiscal 2016. While sounding a cautious note in recent earnings reports, if the company does achieve the low-end of this guidance in fiscal 2016, $2B in annual revenue is around the corner. $160M in operating income therefore is a likely target for fiscal 2016 and assuming current operating margins and tax rates being carried forward, reflects approximately $2.85 in GAAP earnings per share. I'll sound a cautionary note here as I do with most companies in the technology sector. Investors should carefully evaluate Synaptics' GAAP vs. non-GAAP EPS reconciliations. The company excludes share-based compensation, acquisition and integration costs, and some tax adjustments in order to land on its non-GAAP number. These are very material in Synaptics' case as the company books (and will likely to continue to book) $50M in stock-based compensation each year. Integration costs, while they are likely to fade with time, also will be around over the next several years. These acquisition costs will likely run $75M in fiscal 2015 in total. All told, the GAAP vs. non-GAAP reconciliation currently doubles reported EPS numbers ( Q3 2015 GAAP earnings were $0.82/share, adjusted numbers were $1.65/share ). Overall, however, the company operates a solid business model that provides a steady stream of operating profits. Recent acquisitions that have diversified the revenue base are appealing to long-term investors who don't want all their eggs in one basket. However, several of the company's markets have attracted the attention of bigger market players. Qualcomm's (NASDAQ: QCOM ) interest in the fingerprint sector could put pressure on Synaptics' late fiscal 2016 sales, but this is likely to be only a marginal impact given the company's efforts toward revenue diversification. At current price levels, I view the company as a hold into earnings and the next fiscal year.
