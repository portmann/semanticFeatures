Why I switched to a cashback rewards credit card I have been an Air Miles collector for a long time. Â Many people have asked me if Air Miles is the BEST reward program and I always disclose that I have not done a lot of research or comparisons in this area. I did some analysis a while back and thought the Air Miles system was not too bad at the time. Recently, I was offered the BMO Air Miles World Elite MasterCard which gives me 1 mile for every $10 I spend which is improved from my current MasterCard that gives me 1 mile for every $15 I spend. When I look at my MasterCard bill over the past 12 months, We spent a whopping $87,132. Â That means we were averaging $7261 per month of spending. Â That’s a lot of spending but in case you are not aware we consciously put all our spending on that single credit card Related article: Â  A simple way to track spending Â  If I repeat that spending moving forward, based on the new 1 air mile per $10 of spending, I will get 8713 Air miles for the same level of spending. So what would 8713 Air Miles get me? Based on the cash reward system, every 95 points gets you $10 in cash. Â That means I would earn $91. Â $91 is horrible return off $87,132 of spending. Based on flight rewards, these points are probably worth closer to $1000 BasedÂ on merchandise, these points are worth about $800 to $850. These points are based solely off my credit card spending. Â One of the benefits of being an Air Miles collector is the ability to ‘double dip’ and collect more air miles from preferred vendors. Â I figure I get 4000 to 5000 Air Miles per year from other sources but I could get that regardless of the credit card. This got me thinking about the cashback equivalent: $91 on $87,132 of spending is the equivalent of 0.1% cashback. Â That’s horrible!!!! $1000 on $87,132 of spending is like a 1.15% cashback $850 on $87,132 of spending equates to a 0.975% cashback. So, could I do better with a cashback card? After doing this analysis and also reading a couple of articles on cashback rewards credit cards, Â I realized that BMO has a cashback version of my World Elite Mastercard. Â It earns 1.75% cashback on allÂ purchases with no restrictions.Â That means on the same $87,132 of spending, I would get $1524 in cash back rewards which makes it a big winner over the Air Miles Rewards version. I also looked around at some other cashback cards and there are lots to choose from. Â Some cash back cards give better rewards (2% to 5%) for grocery purchases, gas purchases andÂ restaurantÂ purchases but the base rate is usually lower at around 1%. Â Given that I am also a fan of simplicity, I think 1.75% is easy to understand and a solid reward value. Â Both BMO World Elite Cards have an annual fee of $120 but currently this is waived for the first year. The bottom line is I have already made the switch to my new BMO CashBack World Elite credit card. Â It will hurt my special Onyx Air Miles status but in the end, I still think I will win with the simple, easy to understand a 1.75% cashback rewards credit card!
